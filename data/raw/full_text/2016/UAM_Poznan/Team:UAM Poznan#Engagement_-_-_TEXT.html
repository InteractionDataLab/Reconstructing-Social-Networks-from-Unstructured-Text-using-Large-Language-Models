EDUCATION AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
Our iGEM group is not only focused on working in the laboratory, we also want to share the amazing synthetic biology experience with others - teach people about possibilities connected with this field and encourage them to expand the boundaries of their own minds.
In the course of our project, we had the pleasure to spread synthetic biology among high school students who are the most valuable future source of innovation - who knows, maybe one day they will form another great iGEM team and come up with life-saving ideas.
We have organized 6 workshops combined with laboratory classes for over 230 participants! Our team members explained lab safety rules and described stages of recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli. During the workshops, participants worked with our iGEM constructs, including promoters induced by sugars, and learned basic molecular techniques used in laboratories. The participants learned how to use automatic pipettes and then extracted the fluorescent proteins (GFP or RFP) from E. coli. Students were also able to perform electrophoresis in agarose gel, which is used in molecular biology to separate DNA fragments. First, they added loading buffer to earlier prepared DNA samples and then they loaded them into the wells of an agarose gel. The results of electrophoresis and protein extraction were visualized under UV light in our laboratory.
On 25th September 2015 there was The European Researchers' Night. On that day events connected with discovering science took place in 280 cities across Europe and beyond. One of those cities was Poznań and Adam Mickiewicz University. In our laboratory we hosted 5 groups, 16 students each. The first group started at 4 p.m. and the last one finished at 11 p.m.! We hosted both organized as well as young people keen on science or even parents with teenagers. First, our UAM_Poznan team members told about synthetic biology and described stages of recombinant proteins production. We also explained rules of safety in the lab. The participants learned how to use automatic pipettes and then extracted the fluorescent proteins from E.coli. They performed enzymatic lysis of bacteria cells using lysozyme, the enzyme that damages bacterial cell walls by catalyzing hydrolysis of bonds in peptydoglican.
Students were also able to perform agarose gel electrophoresis and observe the results under UV light in our laboratory.
In January 2016 we hosted a group of 18 fantastic students from a biology and chemistry-focused high school class. They came to us from Wronki that is 57km far from Poznań! Our initiative was to spark interest for synthetic biology in the young generation and teach basic molecular techniques used in laboratories. We started from the most important- the lab safety rules. Then our iGEM members made an introduction to genetic engineering and described the Polymerase Chain Reaction. However, we know that the best way to learn something is to do it yourself. Each student performed their first PCR and amplified different parts of our iGEM genetic constructs such as promoters, protein-coding sequences. In the meantime students prepared 1,5% agarose gel and performed protein extraction. They could choose which fluorescent protein they want to extract: RFP (red fluorescent protein) or GFP (green fluorescent protein). The extraction results were observed under Blue Light. We have to admit that all of the students were succeed with protein extraction. When the Polymerase Chain Reaction finished, our students performed electrophoresis in earlier prepared agarose gel. During the time of electrophoresis, we organized a quiz connected with the molecular biology. This was a great success because everyone wanted to get prizes and we in turn were glad that they remembered so much!
The Night of Biologists is an event organized annually at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań. It is an opportunity to spread biology knowledge among children, teenagers and adults. We’ve decided to organize four laboratory workshops for high school students. Registration for our classes was possible via Internet. After a few hours there wasn’t any places left. This time we hosted a lot of students from Poznań’s high schools. It was a pleasure to work with students who were so motivated and active. We started with the most important- the lab safety rules, so how to behave in laboratories and what is forbidden. Next we introduced synthetic biology to them and described stages of recombinant proteins production. We also explained fluorescent proteins origin and the principles of electrophoresis.
The practical part started with learning how to use automatic pipettes. Next each participant had to decide, which fluorescent protein (RFP or GFP) he or she wanted to extract from E.coli. To disrupt the bacteria cell wall, they used the buffer containing Tris-HCl, EDTA, SDS and urea. After incubation in 60°C they centrifuged their probes and observe the results under Blue Light. It was a fantastic feeling to see all those smiles proving the successful extraction. They also performed electrophoresis in agarose gel to observe bands that were corresponding to different DNA samples. At the end of each class we asked some questions about molecular biology to give prizes for the best person in each group.
During The Night of Biologists we also organized a quiz about synthetic biology for the people coming through the corridors. We had nice prizes such as: torches, pens, T-shirts and bookmarks.
After The Night of Biologists we received a mail from a few students from one of Poznań’s High Schools. They attended the final year of a biology-chemistry class and they were keen on molecular biology. Their friend had taken part in our laboratories and they asked if it is possible to organize a meeting for them too. They came to us on 17th February 2016. We showed them our laboratory and explained the lab safety rules. We also described synthetic biology and our iGEM project. They prepared 1,5% agarose gel and performed the electrophoresis in it. They could observe migration differences between linear and circular plasmids. Furthermore, we described all stages of recombinant protein production and then they also performed protein extraction from E.coli.
On 20th April 2016 there was the Poznań’s Festival of Science and Art. The aim of that event is to popularize and spread the knowledge of science and art. We prepared classes for four organized groups from Turek, Białogard, Zbąszyń and Międzyrzecze. We started with an introduction to molecular biology and explained the lab safety rules and what we are going to do. A few people had already used automatic pipettes but we taught the other ones. Then we performed electrophoresis in agarose gel to separate DNA fragments. In the time of electrophoresis students performed protein extraction from E.coli using the buffer containing Tris-HCl, EDTA, SDS and urea. After incubation in 60°C they centrifuged their probes and observe the results under Blue Light. They also observed bands in agarose gel, which corresponded to different DNA samples. The practical class ended with a quiz about synthetic biology. Combining fun with learning is the best way to spread knowledge about molecular biology and learn safety rules of working in a laboratory. We have to also admit that working with such fantastic young people motivates us and gives a lot of energy.
The biology teacher from Turek’s High School was impressed with our workshops during Poznań’s Festival of Science and Art. She asked if there is a possibility to organize the same workshops for other students interested in molecular biology. As a result workshops for three 16-people groups took place at our university on 17th June 2016. The results of extraction and gel electrophoresis confirmed that the students have good abilities to work in a laboratory.
