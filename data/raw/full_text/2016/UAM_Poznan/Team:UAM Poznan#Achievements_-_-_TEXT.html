ACHIEVEMENTS
BRONZE MEDAL
• Registered the team and had great summer. We will attend the Giant Jamboree!
• Successfully completed and submitted the Judging Form and the Safety Forms.
• Created our wiki page with clear attribution of each aspect of our project.
• Created a Description of our project using the iGEM wiki (see: PROJECT ) and document the team’s part using the Registry for the Parts (see: PARTS ).
• Documented new standard BioBrick Parts of Device central to our project and submitted those parts to the iGEM Registry for the Parts: BBa_K2014005 , BBa_K2014006 , BBa_K2014007 , BBa_K2014008 , BBa_K2014009 , BBa_K2014010 , BBa_K2014011 , BBa_K2014012
• Plan to present a poster and give the presentation of our project at the Giant Jamboree in October.
SILVER MEDAL
• Experimentally validated that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of our own design and construction works as expected. This working part is different from the part documented in bronze medal criterion: BBa_K2014000 , BBa_K2014001 , BBa_K2014002 , BBa_K2014003 , BBa_K2014004
• Documented the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part’s Registry entry and submitted this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
• Demonstrated how our team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of the Human Practices issues in the context of our project (see: HUMAN PRACTICES ). These involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security and intellectual property rights.
GOLD MEDAL
• Improved the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and entered this information in the Registry: sfGFP under arabinose promoter s1 without AraC: BBa_K1741000 , sfGFP under shortened promoter xylA1 with improved 5'UTR: BBa_K1741009 , sfGFP with R4-tag under arabinose promoter BBa_K1481003
• Showed that our project is working under real-world conditions (see: APPLICATIONS ). To achieve this criterion, we demonstrated a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab.
