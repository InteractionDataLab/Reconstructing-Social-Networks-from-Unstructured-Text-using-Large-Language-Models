Silver Medal Human Practices
For our Silver Medal Human Practices, we connected with many different people, from both land and sea. On land, we consulted with experts in microbial fuel technology to understand how we could use our microbial fuel cell to power our device. We also participated in a public workshop on synthetic biology and were able to get feedback from people in our community about synthetic biology, plastic pollution in the ocean, and our project. From the sea, we talked with the head of science at Seabin, a company that wants to rid the oceans of plastic with their unique invention. We also received plasic from Parley for the Oceans, an organization that “addresses major threats towards our oceans, the most important ecosystem of our planet.” Parley Read a full description of our human practices here.
