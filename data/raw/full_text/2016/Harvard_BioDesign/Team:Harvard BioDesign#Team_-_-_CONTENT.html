Paulson Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He is developing new biomaterials constructed from engineered proteins and peptides. The overarching goal of his research is to extract innovative design principles from materials and systems that are the product of natural evolution and recapitulate them in synthetic systems where their physical properties can be precisely tuned to suit biomedical and biotechnological needs. Current projects employ a range of approaches, including synthetic chemistry, protein engineering, directed evolution, and molecular biology.</P></ARTICLE><ARTICLE><HEADER><H3>Pichet (Bom) Praveschotinunt</H3></HEADER><P>&quot;Mama Bom&quot; is a graduate student in Joshi lab at Harvard University.
