Parts
The parts used for this project are divided into two large categories: basic parts and composite parts.
Basic Parts
Basic Parts
are parts that serve one specific function, but require other parts to produce protein or perform other functions.
Composite Parts
Composite Parts
are parts made of basic parts that combine the functions of each basic part to provide a higher-order function, such as the production of PETase.
