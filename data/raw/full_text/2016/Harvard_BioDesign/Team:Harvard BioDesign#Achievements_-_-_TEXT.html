GOLD
1.    INTEGRATED HUMAN PRACTICES [Completed]
The design and direction of our project were directly influenced by the feedback we received from both The Seabin Project and microbial fuel cell experts we interviewed throughout the duration of our project. (For example, The Seabin Project brought to our attention real-life factors typically unaccounted for in a lab setting, such as the variance in ocean plastic age; from there, we obtained plastic collected from a beach cleanup for experimental use. Moreover, after interviewing Professor Peter Girguis, Ph.D. we modified the design of our project, particularly the usage of the electrical output of our microbial fuel cell.)
