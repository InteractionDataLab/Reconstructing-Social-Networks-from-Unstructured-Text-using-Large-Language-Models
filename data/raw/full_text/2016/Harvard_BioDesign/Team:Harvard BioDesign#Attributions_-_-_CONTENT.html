They showed that pelB worked as a signal sequence for sending LC Cutinase (which is similar in size to PETase) to the extracellular medium, which gave us evidence that it might work for PETase.

Girguis:</B> Professor Joshi suggested reaching out to Professor Girguis, a member of Harvard's faculty who has previously led an iGEM team. His work was of particular interest to our team because it entails, among other things, developing microbial fuel cells for marine environments. The professor provided a number of technical suggestions: he advised the use of titanium wires instead of copper as they release ions and disturb the potential results we will get. He also suggested using a Standalone voltage data logger for voltage and current measurements and data computing. Girguis also encouraged us to consider the economic viability of our fuel cell project. To help illustrate his point, he discussed his own research and explained that in the case of electronic devices in remote locations at the bottom of the ocean, microbial fuel cells can be more cost-effective than alternatives such as batteries that need to be constantly replaced.</LI><LI><B>Erika Parra, Ph.D.</B> Parra is an associate of Harvard's Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. She has extensive experience working with fuel cells and was kind enough to visit our lab space at the Wyss to help us assemble our cell.</LI><LI><B>Dr. James Weaver:</B> We initially visited the machine shop and they directed us to Dr. Weaver to help us optimize Bielefeld’s MFC design. He noted some design problems in the blueprints for the microbial fuel cell parts. He therefore suggested three changes: extension of the “ear-like” structure, where the bolts go, in the frames as well, besides the shells, so that the frames are better centered; remodeling of the channel that the fluid flows through so that better mixing is induced; and elimination of the “lips” in both the frames and the shells so that the silicone sealing works better and fluid leakage is prevented. Dr. Weaver also helped with the 3D printer that works with UV light, located in 60 Oxford Street, part of Harvard's School John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). </LI><LI><B>Prof. Derek Lovley:</B> Prof. Derek Lovely is one of the leading experts of microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology and has conducted numerous lectures on the economic viability of MFCs. We had a conversation over the phone with Prof. Lovley. on June 21. He suggested looking at specific literature for the building of a microbial fuel cell. SInce platinum is expensive, he thought that the use of ferricyanide as a catalyzer would work as well. He advised to make the chamber anaerobic, because the organisms would otherwise transfer electrons to oxygen instead of the anode itself. He suggested to start off with finding an existing anaerobic digester, such that engineering one might not be necessary. Prof. Lovley noted that Geobacter and Shewanella are usually used in microbial fuel cells but that we may need to use another species if we want our bacteria to metabolize terephthalic acid.”</LI><LI><B>Buz Barstow, Ph.D.:</B> Professor Joshi also directed us towards Dr. Barstow because he has worked closely with MFCs and could help us with the technical aspects of assembling a cell. We consulted Dr. Barstow regarding the use Bacillus and Arthrobacter in a microbial fuel cell, the efficiency of a MFC, and its potential uses. He also provided us with some insightful questions, ranging from fields as diverse as economics to safety. What follows is a message Barstow addressed to our team: </LI><UL style="font-size: 20px; color: #545454"><P>“That’s a really good question. I’m not too sure about Arthrobacter or Bacillus sp. Protocatechuate, and my guess is as good as yours on whether or not they can be used in a microbial fuel cell. </P><P>Also, my guess is as good as yours on whether E. coli can degrade (or be engineered to degrade) terephthalic acid. I would do some google scholaring and see what you can find. How many genes are involved in terephthalic acid degradation?</P><P>You might want to ask yourselves the following questions: how much do you care about degrading terephthalic acid and how much do you care about making electricity? Also, does the ability to degrade terephthalic acid translate into an ability to degrade PET. </P><P><I>Typically, the yield of electricity from a fuel cell is fairly small, so even a mountain of PET bottles is not going to be a solution to the world’s energy problems. However, degrading a stack of bottles is a solution the plastic pollution problem. My feeling is that a microbial fuel cell is only useful here if it allows you to get rid of reducing equivalents from the cell that you wouldn’t be able to get rid of otherwise (say if you can’t access oxygen due to the need for oxygen sensitive enzymes in terephthalic acid degradation).</I></P><P>Ask yourself the following question: given that Arthrobacter can already degrade terephthalic acid, what bottleneck is preventing widespread deployment of this microbe in the real world? Then try to come up with a solution to that problem. </P><P>Also: be aware that Arthrobacter and Bacillus sp. Protocatechuate could also be BSL2. </P><P>All the best, and good luck!”</P></UL><LI><B>Prof. Eiji Masai:</B> He is the corresponding author of papers where researchers attempt to sequence the TPA degradation and uptake genes of the Comamonas sp. Strain E6. He directed us to some bacteria that potentially degrade TPA on ATCC (bacillus species) and informed us how to obtain the Comamonas species that his lab deposited. </LI><LI><B>Sara Hamel Ph.D.:</B> We obtained her contact information through one of our mentors, Bom Pichet Praveschotinunt, who said that she could help us with the printing and building of the MFC. Sara assisted in 3D printing the shells and the frames for our initial microbial fuel cell based on the design we provided from the Bielefeld iGem Team 2013. The printer used was MakerBot, located in Pierce Hall, part of Harvard's School John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. She was also responsible for coordinating access to lab space on campus during the school year.</LI></UL></SECTION><SECTION><H3>Wiki:</H3><P>Wiki Template was modified from Helios by HTML5 UP, which was free for personal and commercial use under the <A href="html5up.net/license">CCA 3.0 license</A></P></SECTION></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="12u"><DIV class="copyright"><UL class="menu"><LI>© 2016 Harvard iGEM</LI><LI>Design: <A href="http://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
