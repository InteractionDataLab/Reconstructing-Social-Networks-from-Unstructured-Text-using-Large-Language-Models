Composite Parts
Composite Parts are parts made of basic parts that combine the functions of each basic part to provide a higher-order function, such as the production PETase.
The composite parts, in general, involve a combination of the T7 promoter, RBS 34, PETase, His-tag, and a stop codon.
Additional features such as sfGFP and secretion tags were used in order to optimize the production, detection, and secretion of PETase.
Overall, there are 8 composite parts, which consist of the following:
BBa_K201000: T7 Promoter + PETase + His-Tag + Stop Codon
BBa_K201001: T7 Promoter + ompT + PETase + His-Tag + Stop Codon
BBa_K201002: T7 Promoter + pelB + PETase + His-Tag + Stop Codon
BBa_K201003: T7 Promoter + YebF + PETase + His-Tag + Stop Codon
BBa_K201004: T7 Promoter + sfGFP + PETase + His-Tag + Stop Codon
BBa_K201005: T7 Promoter + sfGFP + ompT + PETase + His-Tag + Stop Codon
BBa_K201007: T7 Promoter + sfGFP + pelB + PETase + His-Tag + Stop Codon
BBa_K201008: T7 Promoter + sfGFP + YebF + PETase + His-Tag + Stop Codon
