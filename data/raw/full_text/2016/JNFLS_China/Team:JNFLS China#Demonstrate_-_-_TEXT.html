“Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab.” ——criteria that should be met for the gold medal
We developed a rapid and simple diagnosis for Alzheimer’s disease using the different expression of microRNA between patients and healthy controls. To get the blood miRNA, we should collaborate with the local hospital, but there are too many difficulties. First, it takes a lot of time and a lot of evidences to get the patient's blood samples through a rigorous application process, which requires a lot of time and a lot of rights we can’t gain. Second, even if we pass the relevant checks, it is difficult to get fresh blood samples in the game cycle. It depends on whether there will be suffering from Alzheimer's disease patients to take blood tests. Moreover, microRNA extraction from the blood requires a high reagent costs, which we cannot afford. And the operation of the relevant technologies are too difficult for us to learn in the short term. Hence, we have to stop our experiment aiming to detect the actual concentration of miRNA in human blood.
Although we can’t do the “real-world conditions” experiment, we thought our data from experiment using synthesis miRNA can also demonstrate that our whole system working under simulated conditions in the lab. By adjusting the concentration of microRNA (Device 1.0) and the promoter strength of the repressor protein (Device 2.0), we have illustrated that our devices are capable for producing a Laddering Response to the different microRNA’s concentration and our devices are possible for further more practical applications.
