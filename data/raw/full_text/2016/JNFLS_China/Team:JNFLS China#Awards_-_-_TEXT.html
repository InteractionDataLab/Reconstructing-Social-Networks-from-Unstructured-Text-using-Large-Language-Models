This year we joined in iGEM for the first time, but we found there are too many things for us to learn. Without the help from our PIs, instructors, advisors and other people who have helped us, guided us, we wouldn’t finish such an exciting project. Here JNFLS_China team thanks everyone  who gave us help and joined our project!
We will give our special great thank to our PI and graduate students in the Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Shandong University.
We also thank LvDao for their guidance about wiki program!
Thanks all iGEM teams we had collaborations with!
Prizes and medals will be written after the Giant Jamboree.
