Human Practices
Our team knew from the start that human practices were just as important to our project as lab work, and so the dry team worked together to brainstorm and discuss some of the main issues our project might face. We wanted to look into the cures for Cholera and Shigellosis already available for those in need in the developing world; after doing some research we found out the distribution to “Third World consumes only 20% of the global supply of pharmaceuticals.”[1] From this we realised that access to pharmaceuticals is massively lacking from ordering to resupply. This became a problem we wanted to try and find a solution for, which we have incorporated into our design . We also realised that with our project using GM bacteria, the people who would potentially use our product might be concerned about that, and so decided this ethical issue was something that must also be discussed and taken into account.
