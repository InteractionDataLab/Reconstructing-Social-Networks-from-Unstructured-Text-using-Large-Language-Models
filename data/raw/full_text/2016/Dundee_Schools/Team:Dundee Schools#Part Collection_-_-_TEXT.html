Our parts collection is designed to make up a device for targeting any specific pathogen wanted using our osmY-hfq fusion biobrick to secrete our siRNA biobrick out of E. coli. Fusing Hfq with OsmY meant we could have it bind with the siRNA expression system we designed (expression system contains micC sequence for binding with Hfq from E. coli and chiA for binding with Hfq from Serratia marcescens). Using a simple PCR method a targeting sequence can be added to spiRNA specific to the gene of your choice. Using this in tandem with our OsmY-Hfq fusion proteins allows future users to use our system in a variety of other settings.
