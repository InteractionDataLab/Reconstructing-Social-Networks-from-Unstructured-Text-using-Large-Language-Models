Dundee team
We worked side by side with the Dundee collegiate team on our respective projects over the summer holidays. They were an incredible help, and by working on separate yet similar projects at the same time, we have all achieved much more than we ever could have alone; every step of the way we have been providing each other feedback and advice in order to develop wikis, presentations, surveys, graphic design and our projects as a whole. This was invaluable for both teams as it meant things were constantly being approached from multiple angles and viewpoints, allowing us to very quickly develop and move forward with our projects.
iGEM Northern UK Meet-up
We met up with the Edinburgh UG, Edinburgh OG, Glasgow, Dundee and Newcastle teams in Edinburgh for the day, where we presented our project. This was an excellent opportunity as it provided us with lots of fantastic feedback, as well as the chance to meet and chat with all the teams from Scotland (as well as one from England).
iGEM UK Meet-up
As part of our collaboration with many UK iGEM teams, we attended a meet-up hosted by the University of Westminster team in London. This meet-up allowed us to prepare ourselves and see what the Jamboree would be like as we had a poster session and a presentation slot. We received feedback on both, which allowed us to further improve on them. We were also asked some questions like “How are you going to make the RNA specific to the target bacterium?” which we were able to further elaborate on. Doing the presentation also allowed us to gain confidence because of the large audience, a big help for when Boston comes around.
Sheffield iGEM Team
Our supervisors Prof. Frank Sargent and Prof. Tracy Palmer helped the Sheffield iGEM get off the ground and so enter the competition for the first time!
