Hello, we are the 2016 Dundee Schools team from (you guessed it) Dundee, a small city on the East coast of Scotland. Pictured above is where the magic happened, a.k.a. our project; it is the College of Life Sciences, a building owned by Dundee University (who also so very kindly funded us, hint hint here's our Attributions page, which also tells you a bit more about what we all did to contribute to our project).
Below you will find everything you need to know about who we are. Most of it, anyway.
