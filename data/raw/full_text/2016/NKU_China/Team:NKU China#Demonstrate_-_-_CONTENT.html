                In <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:NKU_China/Proof" style="position:relative;z-index:3;color:dodgerblue;">Proof of Concept</A> page, experiment results showed that two AI-2 Response Devices could respond to different AI-2 concentration by emitting different intensity of GFP fluorescence. We managed to 'shut off or 'turn on' the expression of GFP in AI-2 Response Device A.
            </DIV><DIV class="p">
                Results showed that a 1:1 mixture of AI-2 Response Device with AI-2 Suppliers could significantly enhance AI-2-inducible GFP fluorescence compared to the control group (Fig. 1). Fluorescence microscopy images of the cells at 8 h in co-culture also illustrated that in the group which AI-2 Response Device A was co-cultured with pLuxS, the GFP fluorescence intensity is significantly higher than control group (Fig. 2).

                Also, 1:1 mixture of AI-2 Response Device with AI-2 Consumers could significantly depress AI-2-inducible GFP fluorescence compared to the control group (Fig. 3), as expected.

It has been shown that AI-2 has a contributing effect on biofilm formation in <I>E. coli</I>. Therefore, we investigated if AI-2 Consumers and AI-2 Suppliers could interfere with biofilm formation process from this biofilm producer. Co-incubations of pTrcHisB were re-inoculated with pTrcHisB, AI-2 Suppliers or AI-2 Consumers and cells were grown in a 96-well plate for 24 h.</DIV><DIV class="p">Biofilm production was normalized to the final cell density and bacteria co-cultured with AI-2 Suppliers pLuxS and pLuxSMtn showed increased biofilm formation by about 15% compared to identical incubations with pTrcHisB. In the meantime, bacteria co-cultured with AI-2 Consumers showed decreased biofilm formation by about 40% compared to identical incubations with pTrcHisB. A two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test was performed between the groups and the result indicates that the biofilm increase and reduction are both significant.</DIV><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><DIV class="p"><SPAN>Fig.5: Effect of AI-2 Suppliers on biofilm production</SPAN></DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><DIV class="p"><SPAN>Fig.5: Effect of AI-2 Consumers on biofilm production</SPAN></DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="h2 ui-state-active">2. Project Conclusion </DIV><DIV class="p">
                Coordination between cell populations via prevailing metabolic cues has been noted as a promising approach to connect synthetic devices and drive phenotypic or product outcomes. However, there has been little progress in developing 'controller cells' to modulate metabolic cues and guide these systems. This summer, our team successfully constructed two cell machines to manipulate the molecular connection between cells by modulating the bacteria signal molecule, autoinducer-2, which is secreted as a quorum sensing (QS) signal by many bacterial species: AI-2 Supplier is the cell machine which can directly supply and enrich the AI-2 molecules while AI-2 Consumer is another cell machine which can sense, absorb and degrade the AI-2 in the environment.
            </DIV><DIV class="p">
                We found that the overexpression of <I>luxS</I>and <I>mtn </I>gene (pLuxSMtn) resulted in a most significant increase of environmental AI-2, while the overexpression of <I>lsrACDBFGK </I>genes (pLsrACDBFGK) resulted in an extraordinarily efficient AI-2 uptake that was capable of completely silencing QS-mediated gene expression among wildtype cells. We demonstrated the utility of AI-2 Controllers by modulating naturally occurring process of biofilm formation. We envision that 'controller cells' that modulate bacteria behavior by manipulating molecular communication will find use in a variety of applications, particularly those employing natural or synthetic bacterial consortia.
