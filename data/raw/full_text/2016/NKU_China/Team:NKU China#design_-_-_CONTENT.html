We mainly design two cell machines: AI-2 Supplier is the cell machine which can directly supply and enrich the AI-2 molecular level; AI-2 Consumer is another cell machine which can sense, absorb and degrade the AI-2 in the environment. By taking advantage of the special characteristics of AI-2 controllers, we hope to directly control the population behaviors of bacteria in group levels.</DIV><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Fig 1</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="h2 ui-state-active">A detailed explanation of our work on this particular project</DIV><DIV class="p">Coordination between cell populations via prevailing metabolic cues has been noted as a promising approach to connect synthetic devices and drive phenotypic or product outcomes. However, there has been little progress in developing &quot;controller cells&quot; to modulate metabolic cues and guide these systems.</DIV><DIV class="p">Metabolic engineering exploits the genetic modification of cellular pathways to improve production of metabolites and proteins. Many noteworthy examples have been demonstrated wherein these cells serve as &quot;factories&quot; for the environmentally sustainable production of energy, materials, and chemicals. Towards this aim, metabolic engineering has incorporated finely tuned synthetic controllers and cells in the creation of artificial networks.</DIV><DIV class="p">The general structure of these synthetic networks is based on control devices that respond to specific stimuli in a predictable fashion.</DIV><DIV class="p">However, the task of coordinating among and between cell populations remains a critical challenge that can limit the production of desired end-products. One creative approach to address both of these challenges is through the leveraging of cell-Ccell communication networks, and these have been the target of a variety of dynamic control systems.</DIV><DIV class="p">In this work, we have developed bacterial AI-2 suppliers and AI-2-consumers, which can be deployed to control AI-2 in a predictable fashion using the now well-characterized quorum sensing mechanisms of Escherichia coli.</DIV><DIV class="p">AI-2 is synthesized and recognized by a wide variety of bacteria; correspondingly its use as a potential target for modulating QS activities among different cell types is of interest.</DIV><DIV class="p">The use of genetically engineered bacteria to &quot;quench&quot; or &quot;ignite&quot; extracellular AI-2 was first described by Xavier et al. , where genetic deletions of its synthase (luxS) and its repressor (lsrR) were used to interfere with bacterial communication.</DIV><DIV class="p">However, the interrelated complexity of QS networks renders the elucidation of its mechanisms difficult, and the production of simple, &quot;modular&quot; networks would enrich the understanding of these actions.</DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="h2 ui-state-active">How we did it?</DIV><DIV class="p">We have addressed this through the model-based design, construction, and characterization of these &quot;controller cells&quot; to modulate the external AI-2 environment. These cells are designed via the compartmentalization of different aspects of AI-2 processing: production(luxS, mtn), uptake (lsrACDB), phosphorylation (lsrK), and degradation (lsrFG).</DIV><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Fig 2</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class="p">We demonstrate utility by modulating naturally occurring processes of biofilm formation and chemotaxis. We envision that &quot;controller cells&quot; that modulate bacterial behavior by manipulating molecular communication, will find use in a variety of applications, particularly those employing natural or synthetic bacterial consortia.</DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="h2 ui-state-active">Biosafety Considerations</DIV><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Fig 3</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class="p">With the advent of synthetic biology, genetically modified microorganisms are being increasingly used for bio medical, industrial and environmental applications.</DIV></SECTION><DIV id="reference"><DIV class="h">References</DIV><OL><LI>Thompson J A, Oliveira R A, Djukovic A, et al.
