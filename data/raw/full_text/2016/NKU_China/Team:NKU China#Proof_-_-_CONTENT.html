We successfully designed two cell machines: AI-2 Supplier is the cell machine which can directly supply and enrich the AI-2 molecule while AI-2 Consumer is another cell machine which can sense, absorb and degrade the AI-2 in the environment. We validated that AI-2 Controller works as expected by qPCR, HPLC and AI-2 Response Device. We also further demonstrated that our AI-2 controllers have the ability to manipulate biofilm formation process by 'quenching' or 'ignite' AI-2 signal in the environment.</DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="h2 ui-state-active">Design of modular QS elements: AI-2 Supplier</DIV><DIV class="p">There are mainly 2 steps involved in the process of AI-2 production in bacteria cells. AI-2 is produced from S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by Mtn and LuxS and accumulates extracellularly with cell density. In our project, we cloned <I>mtn</I>, <I>luxS</I> into the plasmid pTrcHisB to enable overexpression of proteins associated with these AI-2 production reactions in <I>Escherichia coli</I>. Two AI-2 Supplier devices, pLuxS and pLuxSMtn were successfully constructed using homologous recombination method.</DIV><DIV class="p">During the construction, all intermediate constructs and final plasmids were immediately verified by restriction enzyme digestion verification and/or sequencing. As you can see from Fig. 1, we obtained gel bands at expected position of AI-2 Controller devices, pLuxS and pLuxSMtn.</DIV><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><DIV class="p"><SPAN>Fig. 1: Restriction enzyme digestion verification of pLuxS (left) and pLuxSMtn (right)</SPAN></DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class="p">Device pLuxS and pLuxSMtn were constructed by overexpression of the components responsible for AI-2 production (<I>luxS</I>, mtn). To verify whether the device realized the function as expected, qPCR and SDS-PAGE experiments were conducted. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, two devices overexpressed <I>luxS</I> and <I>mtn</I> mRNA about 4 times than control group, pTrcHisB. Also in SDS-PAGE experiment, you can see the overexpression of LuxS and Mtn protein.</DIV><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><DIV class="p"><SPAN>Fig. 2: qPCR result of <I>luxS</I> gene expression in Device pLuxS</SPAN></DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><DIV class="p"><SPAN>Fig. 3: qPCR result of <I>luxS</I> (left) gene and <I>mtn</I> (right) gene expression in Device pLuxS</SPAN></DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><DIV class="p"><SPAN>Fig. 4: SDS-PAGE result of Device pLuxS (left) and pLuxSMtn (right)</SPAN></DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class="p">
                To further validate whether AI-2 Consumer Devices can actually increase AI-2 environmental AI-2 concentration, we measured the AI-2 concentration in the culture after 3 h induction of IPTG. As illustrated in Fig. 5, in the culture medium of AI-2 Supplier pLuxS and pLuxSMtn, AI-2 concentration was both increased significantly than control group. The result shows that, as expected, AI-2 concentration in the culture of AI-2 Supplier pLuxSMtn is much more than AI-2 Supplier pLuxS.

(i) uptake, primarily through the LsrACDB transporter, (ii) LsrK-mediated phosphorylation of AI-2 (to AI-2P), which blocks export back to the extracellular milieu so that accumulated AI-2P binds the regulatory protein LsrR, derepressing the Lsr transporter as well as enzymes, LsrF and LsrG, and (iii) degradation of AI-2P through the two step process from isomerase LsrG followed with cleaving and thiolation by LsrF. In our project, we cloned <I>lsrACDB</I>, <I>lsrK</I>, <I>lsrFG</I> into the plasmid pTrcHisB to enable overexpression of all proteins associated with these AI-2 processing steps in <I>E. coli</I>. Six AI-2 Supplier Devices, pLsrACDB, pLsrK, pLsrFG, pLsrACDBFG, pLsrACDBK, pLsrACDBFGK were successfully constructed using homologous recombination method.</DIV><DIV class="p">During the construction, all intermediate constructs and final plasmids were immediately verified by restriction enzyme digestion verification and/or sequencing.

Each strain was grown to mid-logarithmic phase (OD~0.4) with the subsequent addition of 40 μM AI-2 and 1 mM IPTG and optical density was recorded throughout.</DIV><DIV class="p">We found that all AI-2 Consumers, pLsrACDB, pLsrACDBFG, pLsrACDBK and pLsrACDBFGK successfully manipulated AI-2 signal in the environment, as expected. As shown in Fig. 14, after the IPTG induction, AI-2 concentration in the environment was significantly reduced in three hours, which means that constructed AI-2 Consumers can 'quench' AI-2 signal in the environment. What's more, statistical analysis shows that AI-2 Consumer pLsrACDBFGK has the most significant absorption ability in manipulating extracellular AI-2 concentration, while there is no significant difference on absorption ability among Device pLsrACDB, pLsrACDBFG and pLsrACDBK.</DIV><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><DIV class="p"><SPAN>Fig. 14: AI-2 uptake profiles of &quot;AI-2 Consumers&quot;</SPAN></DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="h2 ui-state-active">AI-2 Response Device function validation</DIV><DIV class="p">We successfully constructed two devices that could respond to AI-2 by producing GFP fluorescence, providing an independent means to measure environmental AI-2 concentration.</DIV><DIV class="p">We firstly tested whether AI-2 Response Device A and B can respond to different AI-2 concentration.
