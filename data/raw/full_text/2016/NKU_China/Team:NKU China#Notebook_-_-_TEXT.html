In order to make sure the efficiency of our "consumer", we should first knock out the luxS gene in our engineering bacteria GR286(a simplified strain of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3). We used a markerless gene replacement method to knock out the luxS gene.
Construction of targeting vector : the upstream and downstream of luxS gene were combined by over-lapping PCR and ligated into plasmid pKSU.
pKSU-ΔluxS was transformed into GR286, and positive clones were selected.

This week, we tried to use different voltages to transform the plasmid. Sadly, all of these attempts rendered negative results.
We considered whether the luxS gene is toxic for GR286, and the bacteria tends to reject the gene when a strong promoter is inserted upstream of it. So, we planned to use inducible promoter to reconstruct our expression vector.
The plasmid pWH1520 contains a strong xylA promoter originating from Bacillus megaterium, and transcription initiated by this promoter is xylose-inducible. Also, the gene of interest carries its own ribosome binding sequence (RBS) and translation initiation codon. Based on these points, we redesigned primers.

The lsrACDB sequence was divided into two parts and they were cloned separately. Then the two segments were ligated to the plasmid pWH1520 and the recombinant vector was transformed into DH5α. After that, verification PCR was used to select the positive clones. However, we didn't get a good result.

Biofilm studies and evaluation:
pTrcHisB, pLuxS, pLuxSMtn, pLsrACDB, pLsrACDBFG, pLsrACDBK, pLsrACDBFGK were diluted to OD~0.05 and reinoculated at a total volume of 200 μL at a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. IPTG (1 mM) was added at OD ~ 0.4, and biofilms were cultured for ~24 h (&plus;/−30 min) at 30 oC in static conditions. After incubation, optical density was read on a plate reader at 600 nm. The supernatant was gently decanted, and each well was washed 3 times with 300 μL of sterile PBS to detach loosely adhered cells. The plate was then incubated at 60 oC  with the lid off for 60 min, and afterwards, 250 μL of 0.1% crystal violet was added to each well and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Crystal violet stain was aspirated with a pipette and excess stain was washed off by gently submerging and mixing in a tray filled with distilled water until washings were free of the stain. After the microplate was airdried, the dye was resolubilized by adding 250 μL of 95% ethanol, and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 min. The optical density of each well stained with crystal violet was measured at 540 nm.
