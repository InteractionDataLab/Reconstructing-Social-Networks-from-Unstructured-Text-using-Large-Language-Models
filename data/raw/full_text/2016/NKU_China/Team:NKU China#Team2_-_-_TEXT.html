Welcome to Our Awesome Team!
NKU_China consists of faculty members and students from Nankai University, Tianjin. Located in the east coast of Asia and one of the most developed and prosperous cities in mainland China, Nankai University is making groundbreaking progress in both natural and social sciences while holding fast to the orthodox beliefs that inspire us to dedicate to the interest of the public and the nation.
17 undergraduate students from College of Life Science consist of the absolute main force of Team NKU_China. Sharing "iGEMer" as our common title, the team members work closely together from brainstorming solutions for experimental problems to discussing the future prospect of synthetic biology with great enthusiasm and creation. In the meantime, we frequently adjust the project design and experiment plans under the advice and instructions of three experienced graduate instructors and three distinguished PIs.
All of the team members are looking forward to presenting our project and sharing the story of the great science adventure of Team NKU_China to iGEMers all over the globe at Giant Jamboree. Do meet us at our presentation and poster stand!

Hi, everyone! my name is Yujie Zhao, a member of laboratorial group in the iGEM NKU_China team. Besides, I'm the leader of design group. In my leisure time, reading and drawing are my favorite things, because they can calm my mind. I also like challenging myself and mastering something new like making handcrafts, learning new experiment skills and subtitling movie. The word 'impossiblility' is not in my dictionary.

Hello everyone! This is Xiao Liu. It's my second time attending iGEM. I've grown from a sophomore, who was unfimiliar with synthetic biology and science research, into a senior who is devoting myself to them. I was in charge of our wiki last time and our whole project this time. I should say that iGEM has influenced me a lot in many positive ways. I hope our project will attract you this time and  my work can contribute to synbio in the future.

I am an undergraduate student member of the experiment division of iGEM 2016 Team NKU_China I am a girl of various of interests and among them my favorites are music and travelling. I grew up in countryside and I liked to play around in the fields and observe all kinds of creatures especially plants. My love for botany built up in my childhood and now I have become an expert in plant taxonomy. It will be my lifelong career to explore the secret and beauty of life.
Xinyu Ma
I am Ma Xinyu, a junior student of College of Life Science in Nankai University. I have been working on the study about molecular modification of microorganism for two years. It's my first time to attend the iGEM competition and I believe it will be a great challenge but also a chance for me. This year, I spend most of my time on the iGEM competition. I'm generally responsible for the experimental part in our team. I will do my best to complete our research and cooperate with my team member to finish the competition perfectly. Looking forward for the final match in Boston!

I'm Xiong Yuxiu, a member of team NKU_CHINA and mainly contribute in experiment part. Being a biology-majoring sophomore, this is my first year taking part in iGEM. I LOVE challenges and iGEM gives me the chance to experience the thrills of trying different ideas in the field of synthetic biology by means of molecular biology and microbiology. The most exciting thing to me , is when results are not what we thought to be, and the team brainstorms to come up with possible explanations and new experimental designs. Being in iGEM team is my first time to complete a project from scratch and it feels awesome. This is the third year my school takes part in iGEM and not long ago our team had our own lab. We have every reason to believe that with experience accumulated, our iGEM team will be better with our joint efforts.

This summer I mainly work on the conduction of the Measurement tract and the construction of standard parts.
Working on iGEM has allowed me to think of life science through a complete different way'to design a life purposely, to test the possibilities. The construction of standardizing parts is filled with weird and constant error results that had nearly driven me crazy, but they are the key moments for creativity and analysis. It's cool to cooperate with diverse people and have brain storms from time to time. It's a wonderful experience of my life.

I am Chen Chen from Nankai University. As you can tell from the picture,I am an outgoing and energetic girl. I love doing all kinds of field work,related to observing and recording the behavior of animals and plants. Also,I enjoy lab work very much. Although  I am just an undergraduate student, I still try to grasp every opportunity to learn about science. And also,having the chance to confirm the results of science really makes me excited. I guess that's the original motive to devote myself to science.

I am the student team leader and a member of the experiment division of iGEM 2016 Team NKU_China. Besides the overall management of the team, I am also mainly responsible for the conduction of the Measurement tract and the construction of standard parts. My devotion to synthetic biology is due to the fact that even the simplest bacteria are much more delicate than the most complex machines that humans have ever built. The perfection and complexity of life system attracts me to learn and discover.
