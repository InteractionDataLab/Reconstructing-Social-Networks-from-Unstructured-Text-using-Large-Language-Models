Project: the idea
We came to the "AI-2 Controller" project after many brainstorming meetings including all the team members. It would be reasonable to attribute the idea of the project to all the team members because we all contributed to the design of the project..
AI-2 Controller Construction:
All the experiments including AI-2 controller gene circuits construction, AI-2 response device construction and AI-2 controller biosafety construction were designed and conducted by Fankang Meng, Xinyu Ma, Yujie Zhao and Jingzhe Dong.
This part of construction includes the construction of pTrcHisB, pLuxS, pLuxS-Mtn, pLsrACDB, pLsrACDBFG, pLsrACDBK, pLsrACDBFGK, AI-2 Response Device A and B using homologous recombination method. Whats more, the four people listed before also took advantage of mf-lon protease to create safer engineered bacteria.
AI-2 Controller Characterization:
All the experiments in AI-2 controller characterization were designed and conducted by Fankang Meng, Xiao Liu and Xinhao Song.                     This part of construction includes using qPCR, Western blot, microplate reader and HPLC to characterize pTrcHisB, pLuxS, pLuxS-Mtn, pLsrACDB, pLsrACDBFG, pLsrACDBK, pLsrACDBFGK.

Moedling:
This part of work was designed and conducted by Zhuoer Dong, Fankang Meng.
Parts Construction:
Xinhao Song, Xiao Liu, Liangti Dai and Yuxiu Xiong performed all the work of parts standardization.
Interlab Study:
Xinhao Song, Xiao Liu, Liangti Dai and Yuxiu Xiong performed all the work of interlab study.
Human Practices.
Xinglin Zhao, Liangti Dai, Zhuoer Dong and Ruilin Tian organized the "Synfuture" Exposition. Also they organized the iGEM Meeting with iGEM team TJUSLS_China. What' s more, they also interviewed many famous scholars to gather suggestions which greatly improved our project.
Wiki Construction
Zhuoer Dong conducted most of the work for wiki construction, including page design and implementation. He edited web pages, uploaded resources (images, fonts etc.) onto iGEM server and, moreover, fixed numerous bugs. Special acknowledgement must be attributed to dedicated chief editor—Xinhao Song. He proofread all the material several times. Other team members including Fankang Meng, Xinyu Ma, Xiao Liu, Liangti Dai, and Xinglin Zhao kindly provided contents for our wiki.
Supervision
THE INSTRUCTORS were closely involved to keep the instructions in time and the team on track to reach the goals.
Yufen Quan kept a relaxed atmosphere in the lab and her instructions were so clear that we could easily obtain the expected results without the need for further explanations.
Yulei Dang provided tremendous organizational support for our team throughout the whole process.
Jiwei Mao & Xiangxiang Wang gave us helpful advice on AI-2 Controller Protein level experiments.
Acknowledgements
We would like to thank the 'The Ministry Key Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Technology' and Boling College for helping us establish the new iGEM laboratory. We would like to thank Prof. Weihui Wu and Prof. Honggang Wang for letting us use the microplate reader and fluorescence microscope when we characterized the AI-2 Responser. We would like to thank Prof. Lingyi Chen and Prof. Zhihui Cheng for sharing their experience on circuits construction and for giving us helpful advice on how to improve our experiments to obtain better data.
We would like to thank all our colleagues at the College of Life Sciences for their support during our project. Particularly, we would like to thank Prof. Cunjiang Song for kindly allowing us to present our project to freshman students of College of Life Science in a course named "Introduction to Biotechnology" instructed by him.
Finally, we want to thank teams listed below for helping us improve our project on data process and analysis, modelling, human practice, etc.
