Project: the idea
We came to The St2OOL project after many brainstorming meetings including all the team. It would be impossible to define authors here: we all contributed to the design of the project.
AI-2 Controller Construction:
All the experiments including AI-2 controller gene circuits construction, AI-2 response device construction and AI-2 controller biosafety construction was designed and conducted by Fankang Meng, Xinyu Ma, Yujie Zhao, Jingzhe Dong.
This part of construction includes using homologous recombination technology to construct pTrcHisB, pLuxS, pLuxS-Mtn, pLsrACDB, pLsrACDBFG, pLsrACDBK, pLsrACDBFGK, AI-2 Response Device A and B. What’s more, these four people also take advantage of mf-lon protease to create safer engineered bacteria.
AI-2 Controller Characterization:
All the experiments in AI-2 controller characterization was designed and conducted by Fankang Meng, Xiao Liu and Xinhao Song.                 This part of construction includes using qPCR, Western blot, microplate reader and HPLC to characterize pTrcHisB, pLuxS, pLuxS-Mtn, pLsrACDB, pLsrACDBFG, pLsrACDBK, pLsrACDBFGK.
Model:
This part of work was designed and conducted by Zhuoer Dong, Meng Fankang.
Parts Construction:
Xinhao Song, Liu Xiao, Liangti Dai and Yuxiu Xiong performed all the work for parts standardization.
Interlab Study:
Liu Xiao, Xinhao Song, Liangti Dai and Yuxiu Xiong performed all the work for interlab study.
Human Practices.
Xinglin Zhao, Liangti Dai, Zhuoer Dong and Ruilin Tian organized the “Synfuture” Exposition. Also they organized the iGEM Meeting with iGEM team TJUSLS_China. What’s more, they also interviewed many famous scholar to get suggestions which greatly improved our project.
Wiki Construction
This part of work was designed and conducted by Zhuoer Dong, Xianglin zhao.
Supervision
Wetlab work
Wetlab work including AI-2 constroller gene circuits construction and AI-2 Response Device was mainly supervised by Yufen Quan and Yulei Dang. AI-2 Controller Characterization was supervised by Yufen Quan, Xiangxiang Wang.
Drylab Work
Drylab work including Project Design and math models was mainly supervised by Cunjiang Song.
Human Practices.
Supervised by Violeta Beltrn (violeta.beltran@biopolis.es) with the collaboration of Manuel Porcar. Lucas J. Morales supervised modelling of the patentability equation.
