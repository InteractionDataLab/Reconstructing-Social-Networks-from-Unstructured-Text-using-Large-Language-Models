Fluorescent Microscopy

The genetic switch systems that are being characterised make use of two different reporter genes, namely green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP). These will give a visual indication as to the functioning of the parts being tested. The biobricks, BBa_I13521 and BBa_I13522 were transformed into E. coli and serve as positive controls for fluorescent microscopy. These two parts consist of the reporter genes, GFP and RFP respectively and are under the control of a constitutive promoter.
Figure 1. The fluorescent microscopy positive controls GFP (BBa_I13521) and RFP (BBa_I13522).
