Controller based on Quorum Sensing System to manipulate cell-cell communication and population behaviors
What do we do in this summer?
This summer we investigated a kind of quorum sensing molecular, AI-2(autoinducer-2). In our project we try to construct the bacteria machine called Ai-2 Controller which can produce or degrade AI-2 according to the environment and induction conditions. With the important role of AI-2 in population behavior such as biofilm formation, bioluminescence, virulence and antibiotic resistance, AI-2 Controller has its great applications in the fields of fermentation production, reducing antibiotic resistance, improve intestinal microflora environment and so on.
What are the characteristics of AI-2 Controller?
No Side Effect？
No waste to the fermentation environment
AI-2 Consumer & Supplier？
Modulate the external AI-2 environment & attenuating cell–cell communication
Biosafety？
No overgrowth in the fermentation environment & outside the lab
