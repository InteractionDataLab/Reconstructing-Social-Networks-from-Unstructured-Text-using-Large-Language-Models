FI/Abs<SUB>600</SUB> of cultures at selected time</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="h2">Discussion</DIV><DIV class="p">Our result of the relative transcription initiation strength of the three promoters is consistent with the result characterized by RFP fluorescence intensity provided by iGEM headquarter. Three problems, however, can be observed in our results. First, the cell growth of device 1 was slower than all other four groups. This phenomenon could be explained as the growth of device 1 cells was hindered by the translation of GFP most severely. In addition, the FI/Abs<SUB>600</SUB> data of device 1 is not as stable as other groups represent. We first suspected that this was due to the deviation during sampling. However, we also noticed that, according to Table 5, the vibration patterns of the two replicates of device 1 at selected times were almost identical, thus this possibility could be excluded. Before further evidences are collected, we could only hypothesize that this phenomenon might be caused by unique biochemistry process of device 1 cells. Moreover, the fluorescence intensity of device 3 was too weak as to fail to show significant difference from negative control. One possible explanation is that the promoter of device 3 is too weak under our culture condition. Another explanation could be that the observed fluorescence intensity of negative control cells is higher than real situation due to the sample layout pattern in the 96-well plate while measuring the fluorescence. Considering that the samples of negative control are placed between positive control and device 1 and that the 96-well plate that we use is transparent, the fluorescence leakage of positive control and device 1 might enhance the measured fluorescence intensity of negative control. Thus we suggest that the protocol for plate reader relating to the usage of 96-well plate should be adjusted, allowing teams to use black 96-well plate when measuring fluorescence while use transparent 96-well plate for Abs<SUB>600</SUB> measuring.</DIV></SECTION></DIV><DIV class="main" id="foot"><DIV><DIV id="sponsors" class="fooer-column"><DIV class="p">sponsors</DIV></DIV><DIV id="contact" class="fooer-column"><DIV class="p">contact us</DIV><DIV id="address"><DIV class="p"><SPAN>Email:</SPAN> iGEM_NKU_China@hotmail.com</DIV><DIV class="p"><SPAN>Website:</SPAN> 2016.igem.org/Team:NKU_China</DIV><DIV class="p"><SPAN>Address:</SPAN> Nankai University,
