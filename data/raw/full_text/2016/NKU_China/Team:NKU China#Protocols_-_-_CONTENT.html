Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning (CPEC)</DIV><DIV class="p"><SPAN class="bold">Abstract: </SPAN>Circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC) is based on polymerase overlap extension and is therefore free of restriction digestion, ligation or single-stranded homologous recombination. CPEC is highly efficient, accurate and user friendly. Once the inserts and the linear vector have been prepared, the CPEC reaction can be completed in 10 min to 3 h, depending on the complexity of the gene libraries.</DIV><DIV class="accordion"><DIV class="accordion-header"><SPAN class="default">☞</SPAN><SPAN class="active">☟</SPAN> </DIV><DIV class="accordion-content"><DIV class="h3">Introduction</DIV><DIV class="p">CPEC is a single-tube, one-step reaction that normally takes 5–10 min to complete for everyday laboratory cloning. The method is directional, sequence independent and ligase free. It uses the polymerase extension mechanism2 to join overlapping DNA fragments into a double-stranded circular form, such as a plasmid. In a typical CPEC reaction, linear double-stranded insert(s) and vector are first heat-denatured; the resulting single strands then anneal with their overlapping ends and extend using each other as a template to form double-stranded circular plasmids. In CPEC, all overlapping regions between insert(s) and the vector are unique and carefully designed to have very similar and high melting temperatures (T<SUB>m</SUB>), which eliminates vector reannealing and concatenation of inserts and makes CPEC very efficient and accurate. The low concentrations of fragments in the reaction favor plasmid circularization and effectively prevent plasmid concatenation. After the CPEC reaction, the perfectly formed double-stranded circular plasmids, with one nick in each strand, can be directly transformed into competent host cells.</DIV><DIV class="h3">Steps</DIV><DL><DT>1. Design of overlapping sequences between vector and insert(s).</DT><DD><DIV class="p">The key to successful CPEC library construction and multiway CPEC is to carefully select and design the overlapping sequences between the vector and the insert(s) so that all overlapping regions share very similar T<SUB>m</SUB>. The T<SUB>m</SUB> of the overlapping regions should be as high as possible (ideally between 60 and 70<SUP>o</SUP>C) to maximize hybridization specificity. The T<SUB>m</SUB> of all overlapping regions in the final CPEC assembly reaction should match each other as closely as possible, ideally with differences within ± to 3<SUP>o</SUP>C. This will help eliminate mis-hybridization and ensure highest cloning efficiency and accuracy. The length of the overlapping region, typically between 15 and 35 bases, is of secondary consideration and is dictated by the T<SUB>m</SUB>. Standard PCR primer selection rules and software can be applied to facilitate the design process. If PCR is used to introduce overlapping regions with the vector or with adjacent fragments, primers should be designed to include at least two parts, each hybridizing to one end of the two neighboring fragments to be joined. If an additional short sequence needs to be inserted between two existing fragments, it can be simply included in the primer design between the two overlapping regions.</DIV></DD><DT>2. Preparation of linear vector. </DT><DD><DIV class="p">The linear vector can be prepared most conveniently by PCR amplification using primers designed to introduce overlapping regions with the insert(s), as described below in the Procedure; this approach offers the most flexibility in selecting cloning sites. If a convenient restriction site is available on the vector that does not introduce unwanted sequences, restriction digestion can also be used to linearize the vector. To prevent carryover of undigested or intact circular vector templates, we recommend gel purification of the linear vector after PCR amplification or restriction digestion. In addition, to eliminate the effect of any residual carryover vector, we recommend using an empty vector as the starting material for PCR amplification or restriction digestion; this way, any carryover of the empty vector will not interfere with downstream functional assays or screens.</DIV></DD><DT>3. Preparation of inserts. </DT><DD><DIV class="p">The inserts can be a single gene, a gene library, multiple genes or even multiple libraries. They can be isolated from natural sources or synthesized on the basis of in silico designs. Irrespective of whether they are single sequences or libraries, ensure that they share overlapping regions with the vector or neighboring fragments, as described above. If PCR is used to prepare the inserts, as described in the Procedure below, a high-fidelity DNA polymerase (e.g. Phusion DNA polymerase) is preferred in order to minimize the introduction of mutations or addition of an extra nucleotide at the ends of amplified products. Gel purification is sometimes necessary to ensure purity of the products.</DIV></DD><DT>4. CPEC cloning.</DT><DD><DIV class="p">In the final CPEC assembly and cloning reaction, prepared linear vec<U>tor and inserts are mixed together with the reaction cocktail, which includes dNTPs, 1×PCR buffer and a thermal-stable high-fidelity DNA polymerase. The composition of the CPEC reaction cocktail is almost identical to that of a standard PCR, except that no primers are added. The final vector concentration is normally in the range of 5–10 ng/μL and the insert-to-vector molar ratio is in the range of 1:1 to 2:1. The thermal cycling conditions are also similar to those used for a standard PCR reaction, except that fewer cycles are needed. For example, 1–5 cycles are sufficient to clone a single insert or a less complex library; 15–30 cycles may be needed to assemble multiple fragments or clone complex or combinatorial libraries. Depending on the number of cycles used, the total reaction time can be anywhere from 10 min to a few hours. A stringent annealing temperature should be used for thermal cycling, the value of which is determined by the T<SUB>m</SUB> of the overlapping regions and recommen<U>dations for the particular DNA polymerase used. Extension time is calculated by the size of the construct and the extension rate of the polymerase. For single-fragment or single-library cloning, shorter extension times can be used.</U></U></DIV></DD></DL><DIV class="p reference"><SPAN class="bold">Reference: </SPAN>Quan J, <I>Nature Protocols</I>, 2011.</DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="h2">3. ClonExpress MultiS One Step Cloning Kit</DIV><DIV class="p"><SPAN class="bold">Abstract: </SPAN>ClonExpress One Step technology is a simple, fast and highly efficient cloning kit which is based on homologous recombination technology.

Exnase MultiS and reaction buffer supplied in this kit are especially optimized for multi-insertion seamless cloning (MultiS for short). With the help of this kit, sequential assembly of up to five insertions can be realized in a single reaction. Additionally, Exnase MultiS is also compatible with the endonuclease digesting reaction and the PCR reaction. Thus, the digesting products or PCR products can be directly applied in recombination reaction without purification, which greatly simplifies the experimental procedures.</DIV><DIV class="p">Firstly, the expression vector will be linearized at the cloning site of choice. A small sequence (15-20 bp) overlapped with the end of the cloning site will be added onto the insert through a PCR step. After the inserts and the linearized vector are mixed in the presence of Exnase for only 30 min, the cloning DNA products can be directly subjected to <I>E.coli</I> transformation with true positive rate over 95%.</DIV><DIV class="h3">Steps</DIV><DL><DT>1. Preparation for linearized cloning vectors</DT><DD><DIV class="p">Select appropriate cloning sites, and linearize the cloning vector. GC content of 20 bp regions at both ends of linearized cloning vector has great impacts on the recombination efficiency. The maximum recombination efficiency can be realized when the GC content of these regions is within 40%∼60%.Thus, it's better to avoid regions with sequence repeats and select regions containing even GC content.</DIV><DIV class="p">The cloning vectors can be linearized by restriction digesting with endonuclease or by reverse PCR amplification.</DIV></DD><DT>2. Design of PCR primers of the insertions</DT><DD><DIV class="p">The principle for the design of ClonExpress MultiS primers is: introduce homologous sequences (15 bp∼20 bp)into 5' end of primers, aiming to making the ends of amplified insertions and linearized cloning vector identical to the ends of their neighbours which is required for recombination reaction. Taking sequential assembly of three insertions (assembly order from 5' to 3' is as follows: insertion 1, insertion 2, insertion 3) to pUC18 cloning vector as example, design the primers as below:</DIV><DIV class="p">Firstly, design the forward primer of insertion 1 and the reverse primer of insertion 3 (two insertions next to cloning vector) according to Figure 1.</DIV><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN>Figure 1: Design of the forward primer of insertion 1 and the reverse primer of insertion 3</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class="p"><SPAN class="notice">Notice</SPAN>: If the primer length exceeds 40 bp, PAGE purification of synthetized primers is recommended, which will benefit the recombination efficiency. When calculating the T<SUB>m</SUB> of primers, the homologous sequence of vector ends should be excluded and only gene specific amplification sequence should be counted.</DIV><DIV class="p">Secondly, design the reverse primer of insertion 1 and the forward primer of insertion 2. Homologous sequence used for inter-recombination between insertions can be fully added to either the reverse primer of insertion 1or the forward primer of insertion 2, and also can be partially added to both of them. Taking the addition homologous sequence to the reverse primer of insertion 1 as an example, design the primer according to Figure 2.</DIV><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN>Figure 2: Design of the reverse primer of insertion 1 and the forward primer of insertion 2</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class="p"><SPAN class="notice">Notice</SPAN>: If the primer length exceeds 40 bp, PAGE purification of synthetized primers is recommended, which will benefit the recombination efficiency.

Design principles are similar to that of the reverse primer of insertion 1 and forward primer of insertion 2 respectively (see Figure 2).</DIV></DD><DT>3. PCR amplification of insertions</DT><DD><DIV class="p">Insertions can be amplified by any polymerase (Taq DNA polymerase or other high-fidelity polymerases). It will not interfere with the recombination efficiency whether there is A-tail in the PCR products or not, which will be removed during recombination and missing in the final construct.</DIV><DIV class="p">Take a small amount of products and run agrose electrophoresis after PCR to confirm the yields and specificity of amplification. Exnase MultiS is compatible with most PCR reactions. As a result, PCR products can be directly applied to recombination reaction without further purification if the PCR templates are not circular plasmids which share the same antibiotic resistance with the cloning vector.</DIV></DD><DT>4.
