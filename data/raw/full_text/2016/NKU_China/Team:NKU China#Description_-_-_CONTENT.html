        </DIV></DIV><DIV class="main" id="description"><DIV class="h1">Description</DIV><SECTION><DIV class="h2 ui-state-active">Abstract</DIV><DIV class="p">This summer, our team has been aiming to engineer bacteria for supplement and absorption of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) in the natural and artificial environment. We have mainly designed two cell machines. AI-2 Supplier is the cell machine which can directly supply and enrich the AI-2 molecule while AI-2 Consumer is another cell machine which can sense, absorb and degrade the AI-2 in the environment. By taking advantage of the special characteristics of AI-2 controllers, we hope to directly control the population behavior of bacteria in group level.</DIV><DIV class="p">What's more, biosafety is further taken into consideration in our project. By applying gene circuits to control essential gene expression under the assigned biocontainment conditions, we can block essential gene expression to kill the cell upon loss of the biocontainment signal.</DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="h2 ui-state-active">AI-2 Concept</DIV><DIV class="p">Success in nature depends on an ability to perceive and adapt to the surrounding environment. Bacteria are not an exception: they recognize and constantly adjust to changing situations by sensing environmental and self-produced signals, altering gene expression accordingly. Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is a signal molecule produced by LuxS, an enzyme found in many bacteria species and thus is proposed to enable interspecies communication. Two classes of AI-2 receptors and many layers and interactions involved in downstream signaling have been identified up till now. So far, AI-2 has been implicated in the regulation of numerous niche-specific behaviors across the bacteria kingdom. </DIV><DIV class="p">In <I>Escherichia coli</I>, LuxS generates AI-2 from metabolic precursors. AI-2 molecules are then exported out of the cell by TqsA. AI-2 is primarily taken up through the ABC-type transporter Lsr, and then phosphorylated by LsrK to AI-2-P. AI-2-P depresses the response regulator LsrR, thereby activating transcription of the <I>lsr</I> operon. AI-2-P is degraded by LsrF and LsrG.</DIV><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>AI-2 quorum sensing network in <I>E. coli</I></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="h2 ui-state-active">Motivation</DIV><DIV class="p">Coordination between cell populations via prevailing metabolic cues has been noted as a promising approach to connect synthetic devices and drive phenotypic or product outcomes. However, there has been little progress in developing 'controller cells' to modulate metabolic cues and guide these systems.</DIV><DIV class="p">Metabolic engineering exploits the genetic modification of cellular pathways to improve production of metabolites and proteins. Many noteworthy examples have been demonstrated wherein these cells serve as 'factories' for the environmentally sustainable production of energy, materials, and chemicals. Towards this aim, metabolic engineering has incorporated finely tuned synthetic controllers and cells in the creation of artificial networks. The general structure of these synthetic networks is based on control devices that respond to specific stimuli in a predictable fashion.</DIV><DIV class="p">However, the task of coordinating among and between cell populations remains a critical challenge that can limit the production of desired end-products. One creative approach to address both of these challenges is through the leveraging of cell—Cell communication networks, and these have been the target of a variety of dynamic control systems.</DIV><DIV class="p">AI-2 is synthesized and recognized by a wide variety of bacteria, which is known as a universal language in bacteria populations; correspondingly its use as a potential target for modulating Quorum Sensing (QS) activities among different cell types is of interest. In this project, we have developed bacteria AI-2 suppliers and AI-2-consumers, which can be deployed to control AI-2 concentration in a predictable fashion using the now well-characterized QS mechanisms of <I>E. coli</I>.</DIV><DIV class="p">We have addressed this through the model-based design, construction, and characterization of these 'controller cells' to modulate the external AI-2 environment.</DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="h2 ui-state-active">Design &amp; Functional Prototype</DIV><DIV class="p">We developed 'controller cells' that manipulate the molecular connection between cells by modulating the bacterial signal molecule, autoinducer-2, which is secreted as a QS signal by many bacteria species.

                            As illustrated in Panel A, there are mainly 2 steps involved in the processing of AI-2 production in bacteria cells. AI-2 is produced from S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by Mtn and LuxS and accumulates extracellularly with cell density. In our project, we cloned <I>mtn</I>, <I>luxS</I> into the plasmid pTrcHisB to enable overexpression of proteins associated with these AI-2 production machanisms in E. coli. Two AI-2 Supplier Device, pLuxS and pLuxSMtn were successfully constructed using homologous recombination technology.
