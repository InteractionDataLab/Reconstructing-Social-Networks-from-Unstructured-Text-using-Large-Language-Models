EE16
A part of our Team (Benjamin, Damien, Joaquin and Kilian) went to the European iGEM Meetup that was organized in Paris by IGEM IONIS (July 2 and 3). It was a great opportunity to present for the first time our project to other people. We created a poster for the occasion. This experience permit us to challenge our project to different views and we have seen what the other teams are working on.
It was really interesting and we bonded with other teams thanks to the party organized by our french host.
Here is a picture we took on the Champs de Mars to enjoy a soccer game for the european championship with other teams (Cardiff_Wales, iGEM Tuebingen and UAM_Poznan).
