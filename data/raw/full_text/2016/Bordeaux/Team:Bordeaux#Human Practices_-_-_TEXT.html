Human practices are an important aspect of the iGEM competition.
The human practices allow us to not focus only on the scientific parts but also show interest in the other aspects of the iGEM project such as Philosophy, Public Engagement, Education or Ethics. This year, our team worked on many projects in order to :
explain to everyone what synthetic biology is and its use in our daily lives
transmit to children and teenagers our scientific knowledge
think about the ethical aspects of the tool CRISPR-CAS9 and our tool EpiCRISPR
meet professionals and teachers to deal with our project in depth
This mind-map summarizes our human practices project.
