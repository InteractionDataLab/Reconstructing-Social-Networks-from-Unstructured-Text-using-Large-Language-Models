The meeting between People, Science and Food!
"Apéro Science" which means Science Aperitif in French is a series of events organized by our team in collaboration with M. Marc CHEVALIER, assignment manager of Talence innovation Sud Développement. The first event was held on May, 26th at the Forum des Arts et de la Culture in Talence and the second one was held on October, 6th at the Bordeaux University. For an hour, professionals made a presentation about a chosen topic in order to explain it to a large public (60 persons for the first, 100 for the second). After their presentation, the audience could have a discussion with them in order to make their questions. Following the debate, everyone was invited to an aperitif prepared by the team!
These events were organized with the intention of familiarizing more and more people with the scientific popularization. The team worked hard in order to invite students and people from non-scientific fields and professionals of the concerning fields. We found it extremely interesting discussing with all these people and sharing with them our knowledge in order to open their minds but also open a little bit more ours!
This year, we focused on two interesting topics which were:
Change your mind about GMOs!
Most of the time, when we talk about GMOs what comes to people's minds are the modified plants used by the food industry. Associating them uniquely to this use, many people think that GMOs are a great danger for the society. However, GMOs may also save lives when we use them to find new therapies for diseases. Our first Apéro Science had as a goal to explain to our audience what GMOs are and which existing GMOs are used in the different fields. Our objective wasn't to convince them to be for or against GMOs but to inform them on this topic and make them consider more this complex question.

Science and Media
In the industry and research fields, researchers have to be conscious of the latest scientific innovations and discoveries. Thanks to the scientific media, they may know about the advances of their colleagues in the whole world. But outside these areas, information is often obscured or sometimes distorted or false. How do the general media see and explain Science?
For our second Apéro Science, we organized round tables with different professionals (journalists, researchers, scientific mediators, and others ...) in order to have our questions answered.
