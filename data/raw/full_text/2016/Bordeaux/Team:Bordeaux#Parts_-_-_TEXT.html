Here, are indexed our several parts that we designed during our project
Part Collection
Sleep with C. elegans collection
From BBa_K1935000 to BBa_K1935017: These parts can be used to study sleep phenomena in C. elegans.             You can use DSIP to see its effects on the worms and you can create a photo inducible tool which can be used to control its sleep.
EpiCRISPR collection
From BBa_K1935018 to BBa_K1935022: These parts can be used to create our epiCRISPR tool to lead a DNA methylation in a sequence-specific way. These parts willl be gathered into three designs of the tool in order to find the most efficient and accurate aversion.
