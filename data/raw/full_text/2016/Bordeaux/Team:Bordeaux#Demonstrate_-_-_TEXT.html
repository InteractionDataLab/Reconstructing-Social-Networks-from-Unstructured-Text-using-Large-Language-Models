This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the gold medal criterion for proof of concept .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. You can demonstrate your project or system working under real world conditions to achieve gold medal criterion #4.
What should we do for our demonstration?
Standard teams
If you have built a proof of concept system, you can demonstrate it working under real world conditions. If you have built a biological device that is intended to be a sensor, can you show it detecting whatever it is intended to sense. If it is intended to work in the field, you can show how this might work using a simulated version in the lab, or a simulation of your device in the field. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Special track teams
Special track teams can achieve this medal criterion by bringing their work to the Jamboree and showcasing it in the track event. Art & Design, Measurement, Hardware and Software tracks will all have showcase events at the Giant Jamboree. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
