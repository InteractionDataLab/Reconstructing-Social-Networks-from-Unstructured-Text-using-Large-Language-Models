Everyone need help
Collaborations in iGEM competition is very important because it makes connection between teams and it makes us realize how is important to help each other. This year, our team tried to help several teams and some team helped us in order to success our project.
iGEM Aix-Marseille helped us to validate our model. They worked on the paper « Dynamics of plasmid transfer on surfaces » writen by Lone Simonsen. They had to search and organize the papers data to compare it to our computationnal results.
After a Skype meeting with iGEM INSA-Lyon, they helped us on our model by suggesting us a mathematical model for bacterial growth. We also hosted two of their members during their visit for a conference related to aptamers in Bordeaux.
Because we were overflowed with work, iGEM Toulouse made a graphical representation on blender to illustrate our safety model and create a 3D animation of our logo (see our pages Home and Model ).
On our part, we participated to their video project where we have explained in french some essential protocols used in synthetic biology. Click there to their videos.
For their Human Practices part, iGEM EPFL created a website to highlight the iGEM team of the 2016 edition. We had the honors to be inside their site, check out our article there .
We helped iGEM Tel-Hai by participating to their project « 65 roses Campaign » in order to bring out Cystic Fibrosis. We have to post a photo of us holding a rose in order to raise awareness amongst the general public and raise money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation of Israel.
