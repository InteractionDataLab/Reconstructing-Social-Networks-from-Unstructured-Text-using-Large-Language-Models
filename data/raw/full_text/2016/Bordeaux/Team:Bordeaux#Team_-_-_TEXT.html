The members
Hiba BEN MOHAMED, a real iGEM addict!
Hiba is the oldest member of our team.
24 years old,  currently in her 5th year of Agroscience Biology specialized in Phytopathology and Mycology (Bordeaux University), she started her first iGEM adventure in 2014. Against winds and tides, she is always there (we can't get rid of her!), supporting the team with her happiness and her smile. Money (for sponsoring!) and handsome guys can't resist to her charms.
