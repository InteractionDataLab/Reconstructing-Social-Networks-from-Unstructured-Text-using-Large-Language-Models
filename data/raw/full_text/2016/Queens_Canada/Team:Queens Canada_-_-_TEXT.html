Using Natural Products to Reinvent Drug Discovery
This year, Queen's iGEM (QGEM) is diving into the field of natural product biosynthesis. Natural products make up a significant portion of medicines on the market, and many of these are made through micro chemical factories found in bacteria. Our team this year took on the task of investigating the potential of Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases (NRPS), one of nature's assembly lines responsible for discovery of a wide range of therapeutic drugs. With NRPS, we hope to sow the seeds for the future of biosynthesis!
