This will start when the DNA from IDT arrives.
●
We have to get the pET-16b vector from Dr. Allingham's lab. Digest the vector with NdeI and BamHI to linearize it.
●
PCR the oxidation domain with the gibson assembley primers.
●
Run a gel to verrify the size of the insert + RE digestion.
●
Purify with nickle affinity chromatography
Use the nanodrop on the pET-16b vector received from the Allingham lab. the vector had a concentration of 34.7 ng/ul.  Due to the low concentration it was recommended we transform and propagate the vector.
The pET-16b plasmid was used to transform a culture of XL1 Blue cells. 5 ul of DNA was used for the transformation. Plates were made with Amp resistance.

1/10 and 1/100 dilutions were prepared.

Two colonies were found on the 1/10 dilution plate.
Another transformation was attempted with DH10B cells using the pET-16b vector. 5 ul of pET-16b vector was used and the transformation was plated on AmpR plates.

The over night cultures were mini prepped using a Nucleospin Miniprep Kit. Multiple colonies on transformation plate, none on control.
Mini Prep

The DNA concentration of each mini prep was found to be (1) 126.45 ng/ul and (2) 76.5 ng/ul
A 0.8% gel was ran using the two miniprep samples after they were digested with EcoRV. The gel was streaky including the ladder, but two bands were visible in accordance to a EcoRV digest. Possible troubleshooting: properly heat inactivate the enzyme. Pour deeper gel wells since they felt shallow when pipetting.

An over night culture was prepared using two colonies from the pET-16b DH10B cells plate. 4 ul of Amp was added to the LB of the ON.

Mini prepped the two over night cultures. DNA was clumpy instead of wispy for one of the mini prep tubes. Resulted in low concentration of DNA and impure yield.
pET-16b_DH10B #1 : 93.85 ng/ul of DNA. pET-16b_DH10B #2 : 39.60 ng/ul of DNA.
EcoRV digest of pET-16b_XL1B #1, pET-16b_XL1B #2, pET-16b_DH10B #1. Ran a 1% gel.
Insert Gel Here. Two bands present around 4.2 and 1.5 kb which corresponds to pET-16b vector cuts. Air bubble in gel may have caused lane shit upwards.
The next step since pET-16b was confirmed is to amplify the oxidaiton domain ordered from IDT with the set of Gibson primers and assemble it in the pET-16b vector using Gibson assembly.

The ON cultures were cloudy in the morning signifying bacterial growth. All of the cultures were mini prepped.
Mini Prep
The mini prep was digested with EcoRV in order to verify the insert of the BpsA oxidation domain. The domain contains a EcoRV site so 3 bands were expected on the gel compared to the 2 seen for the regular pET-16b vector.
Insert EcoRV digest gel.

The OD was checked periodically and 0.5 mM and 0.2 mM of IPTG were used to induce protein production when the cultures were at an OD600 level of 0.8. The cultures were left at 37 oC and 30oC over night (12 h)

No significant band was present at 52 KDa which would have been the mass of the oxidation domain and linker.
Future Steps:
1.
Use a higher level of IPTG for induction 1mM - 1.5 mM in order to stimulate protein production
2.
Take colony samples at 2, 4, and 6 hours after IPTG induction.
3.
Large band was present around 30 KDa. Using Phyre2 the conserved oxidation domain region was constructed through homology modeling. The oxidation domain itself would be 34.2 KDa. There might be some form of protease activity.
4.
Test will be re run again but using a larger 250/500 ml flask.

The purpose of creating a PadE like module with an interrupted adenylation domain containing the Oxidation domain from BpsA is to demonstrate that the nature readily uses the hypervariable loop between A8 and A9 motifs in the adenylation domain as a place for inserting tailoring domains.
The module will be fused with the oxidation domain through Gibson assembly and expressed in BAP1 cells

Beginning of enzymatic assay
We believe that the oxidation domain is responsible for oxidizing the cyclized glutamine, or pyroglutamine
Pyro-Gln was ordered from Astatech. It was resuspended in dH2O. It had a blue colour when suspended in solution. Auto oxidation of Pyro-Gln might occur creating indigoidine.

Protein Assay
Pyro-Gln has a peak of absorption at 595nm due to the blue colour. Indigoidine also has the same OD in H2O.
Protein in phosphate buffer was used as a reference
800 ul Protein and 200 ul of Pyro-Gln was the reaction
Pyro-Gln with phosphate buffer used as a secondary reaction
incubated at 30C checked back every 20 min,
No apparent change in OD
