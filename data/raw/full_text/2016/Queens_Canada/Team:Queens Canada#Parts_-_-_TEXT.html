BBa_K2064001 - Tyrocidine A Donor Domain with a Golden Gate Insert Site
We developed a BioBrick that is used to link the inserted protein with a protein containing a Tyrocidine B acceptor domain. This allows the two proteins to come together in physical space through protein-protein interactions and increase the efficiency of enzymatic gene clusters. It is under the control of an inducible T7 promoter and terminator pair from a pET-16b vector allowing expression of protein. It contains a golden gate cloning site for the scarless insertion of NRPS modules or other proteins. It contains a pSB1C3 backbone.
Our goal was to facilitate the use of NRPS Communication Mediated domains in the creation of combinatorial NRP libraries. However it extends far beyond NRPS since it can be used to tether any proteins together in chemical space unidirectionally.
BBa_K2064002 - Tyrocidine B Acceptor Domain and Donor Domain with a Golden Gate Insert Site
We developed a BioBrick that is used to link the inserted protein with a protein containing a Tyrocidine B donor domain as well as a Tyrocidine C acceptor domain. This allows the two proteins to come together in physical space through protein-protein interactions and increase the efficiency of enzymatic gene clusters. It is under the control of an inducible T7 promoter and terminator pair from a pET-16b vector allowing expression of protein.
