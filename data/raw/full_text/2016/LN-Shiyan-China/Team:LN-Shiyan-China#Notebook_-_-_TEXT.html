We sought advice from International Teenage Competition and Communication Center (ITCCC), where Dr. Mao Yong suggested us that we should establish a team and find a suitable lab or build a high school lab by ourselves.

We discussed with our teacher about building a competition team for iGEM. Although strongly supported by Zhang Shuang, teacher of international department of Liaoning Province Shiyan High School, we can’t build a lab in our high school. Therefore, we need to find a lab outside.

It took so much money to build a lab by ourselves and our school doesn’t have the resource to do so either. So we turned to life science department of Liaoning University for help in February. Professor Wang Qiuyu learned what we wanted, how we loved biology, math and modeling and our wishes to get opportunities to put the theory of synthetic biology into practice. He support our idea and approved that we work together with his team to study synthetic biology.

We used Weibo, QQ and posters to recruit members into our team. Finally we have a team of nine. We divided up work based on individual’s specialty. Some liked biology, some loved math, and also some preferred software. Together, we are IGEM team shiyan_SY_China.
