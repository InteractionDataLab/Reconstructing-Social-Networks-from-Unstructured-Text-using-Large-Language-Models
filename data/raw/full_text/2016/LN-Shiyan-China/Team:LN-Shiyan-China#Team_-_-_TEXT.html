WE ARE BACK！！！ This time, 13 students with different specialities join in the team LN-Shiyan-China to achieve the same goal----- eliminating the pesticides residues in crops. Under the help of our 3 teachers, we successfully improve the result in the field of biology and know better about the concept of teamwork. We will be fearless to explore to make sure the results won’t be reckless. We believe in what we believe will make the world a better place, just by changing from the most fundamental thing in our lives--- the food we eat.

I am Ziyang Guan. Biology is my favorite subject. I like it because it reviews the world to me through experiments and facts. As a member of IGEM, I enjoy cooperating with others to decode the secret of bio-engineering.

I am Tianrui Xu. The luckiest thing during this process is that I get a general understanding of the harm of pesticides, so I devote to propagandize this issue by establishing a website in order to let more people be aware of their food safety.
