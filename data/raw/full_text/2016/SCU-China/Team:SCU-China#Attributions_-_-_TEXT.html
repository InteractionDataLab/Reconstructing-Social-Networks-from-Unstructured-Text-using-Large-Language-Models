Our Team
SCU-China is founded in 2012,with the support of the College of Life Science of Sichuan University.The team exists as a scholar club in the university and it really provides a platform for all students to show their passions and potentials.Some guys have been working in the team for a few years,making the whole team really a big family.
This year,we get students from ten different colleges and it gives us the chances to know different majors and work together.We really enjoy the time and it leaves such a deep impression on everyone who contributes here.We design all our projects independently by ourselves.
Though we haven't got any gold medal as far,we gained a lot from the process.We really enjoy the iGEM competition.
This year, we shot a video in our campus called “Ordinary E. coli” to show our team spirit and attract others’ attention to our project. And we got the copyrights from the original song writer “iLem” on Sina Weibo to cover the original song “Ordinary Disco”, which is quite famous in China. Check this out!

This is the third year for me to be an iGEMer. Honestly, iGEM plays a critical role during my college years. From a team member for last two years, to the team leader (the group leader of CecropinXJ expression group as well) for this year, I have learnt too much from iGEM. Personally speaking, iGEM is a fantastic platform for college students to learn what is real research, and how to collaborate with others in lab environment. My passion towards research will be continued even after I've become a former iGEMer.

It's the second year for me to join the iGEM competition. It's surprised that I became the co-leader of the team as a Grade 2 student then and the project designer this year. I'm responsible for the VHb gene in experiment part. I really appreciate the recognization of me. I want to thank all the team members. It's you guys who company me through the whole year. The experience of working together for one goal will become an important part of my student life forever. And I've decided to enter a synthetic biology lab to study further in this field.

This is the second year for me to participate in the iGEM. In retrospect of last year, I have learned rudimentary molecular experiment skills from our precedents. During this year, I get myself familiar with other advanced skills such as Gibson Assembly, OE OCR and qPCR. I believe that the headquarter of iGEM gives us a scope to image our own biology machine freedomly although for a short while.  At last, I would like to appreciate Miss. LUO as a crucial precedent to guide me into this interesting molecular biology realm.

I may have passed one thousand days with iGEM. At the beginning, I learned basic knowledge of biology and tried to do some easy experiment. After one year, reading paper and knowing the principle of experiment became important. Now I'm helping freshmen, designing the experiment of expressing AarC and let it come true. There are so much reminiscence and  growth during the time in iGEM, which are the most precious wealth.

It's a precious experience for me to join 2016 SCU iGEM team. iGem competition brings me a chance to design and practice a whole project, which is the first time for me. I'm the main member of Aarc expression group for this year. During the experiment process, honestly, there always troubles and problems come out. But they taught us a lot after we get through. In short, iGem gives me a hot sense of uplift in research and the joy of experiment.

Actually, this is the first year of my iGEM journey, to which I have contributed all my passion and talent. I am a grade 2 student of phamarcy, iGEM was a whole new thing for me at the very beginning. With my experience on proteomics and phamarcy, I joined in "tnaA knocking out" group and take the responsibility of RED recombination operation and protein gel & HPLC certification work. Working with all these kind guys is a wonderful experience, from which I have learned a lot. I am proud of being a iGEMer.

This is the second year for me to be an iGEMer in SCU-China. This year I do much hard work on the expression of CecropinXJ and practice a lot not only the experimental skills but also  the logical and critical thinking. To be honest, it is iGEM that makes me determined to devote myself to biological research. And fortunately, I have met the most important friends in my life in the course of the two years in our team. We are all fond of iGEM and we are going to continue working for it.

I have been an iGEMer two years.Last year I think I did not do anything useful. The only thing I did is learning the basic experimental skills. In this year I mainly responsible for knocking out tnaA and verify the knock out bacteria. I participated in determination of indole curve and some other things. The competition of iGem though my college, it will be the best memory in the future.

It's my first time to take part in the iGEM. In summer, I stay in the lab for a month. I have never worked for a long time in the lab before and this is really a valuable experience in my life. I have learned how to keep everything ready so our work won't be delayed frequently. Also, I gained many interesting friends and found many delicious foods around my collage : ). To me, iGEM is an excellent chance to do our own experiments but never worry about the funds and results. Thanks to iGEM. Thanks to SCU. Thanks to the Lifescience school.

Undeniably, when it comes to the most unique experience I have gained as a freshman, the time I spend on iGEM should be mentioned. Worked in acetate metabolism and human practice groups, I'm glad to acquire so much synthetic biology knowledge, experiment skills from responsible seniors, and get used to teamwork. iGEM provides us with an excellent stage to design, demonstrate, and present the project, which deeply attracts me. When we design the project with inspirations and creativity, the synthetic biology is definitely brought to life.
