BBa_K1919000
The CDS of antimicrobial peptide CecropinXJ
BBa_K1919001
Promotor J23105 + 5-tag system + CDS of CecropinXJ
BBa_K1919002
Promotor J23106 + 5-tag system + CDS of CecropinXJ
BBa_K1919003

BBa_K1919100
Induce cell lysis of E.coli when the temperature is raised to 42℃
BBa_K1919101
Mutant of a temperature-regulated promoter(BBa_K608351) that promote transcription when the temperature is raised up to 37℃, which is more sensitive compared with the wild type.
BBa_K1919102
Based on part BBa_K1919100 but containing a mutant type of the temperature-regulated promotor so that when at 37℃,this part can kill E.coli at a higher rate.
