Basic Part
Our basic parts include crystallin alpha a and alpha b (two main proteins found in the lens), cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (which makes 25HC, a molecule that breaks apart protein clumps in cataractous lenses), glutathione reductase (which produces glutathione, an important antioxidant in humans, animals, plants, and fungi).
