Composite Part
The composite parts consist of intermediates, a 10x histidine Tag and a terminator, allowing users to purify the protein. In addition, a composite part that puts green fluorescent protein behind the strong promoter, RBS, and in front of the histidine tag can be used to test protein expression levels and protein purification.
