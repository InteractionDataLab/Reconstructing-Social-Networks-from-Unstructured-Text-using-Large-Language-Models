Wiki Philsophy
In making our Wiki, we strive to make navigation as simple and intuitive as possible. To achieve this goal, all material is placed on five pages: Project Background, Experimental Summary, Model, Human Practice Summary, and Safety. Everything we did is documented on these pages.
Other important pages, such as attributions, collaborations, team, notebook, parts, etc, can also be accessed via the navigation bar.
This year, iGEM rules require teams to place all information that are presented to the judges to be placed on static Standard Pages. Although we create these pages, the only intended audience are judges. Normal visitors should not visit these pages; the major five pages in the navigation contains all information.

Animation
We created a cool animation on this website. For the home page and this page (Wiki Standard Pages), the animation is automatically turned on, and a tutorial popup is displayed. For other pages, to avoid being a distraction, the animation is disabled unless the user manually activates it, by turning off prevention.
You should notice that the background slowly blurs. This simulates how your vision is impaired when cataracts form. The beautiful view of Taipei, most notably the skyscraper Taipei 101, slowly blurs, as your screen develops cataracts. The page slowly lags as well, indicating that your day-to-day function is impeded by this lack of vision.
The popup offers a full tutorial on the animation. Using Treatment (CH25H enzyme which produces 25HC) eyedrops, you can reverse the cataracts, meaning that the screen slowly unblurs. However, you are instructed to turn this off as soon as the screen is clear, to avoid waste.
Then, the Prevention (GSR) eyedrops should be turned on, to prevent further cataracts from forming. By first reversing cataracts, and then turning on prevention, then your eyes (the screen) become pernamently clear.
The LOCS score, described in the Model, quantifies how severe your cataract is, from 0 to 6. As you develop cataracts on your screen, the score increases, and the screen blurs. When treatment is active, the LOCS score decreases.
We would appreciate any comments or questions about this animation. Please send them to averyw17113532@tas.tw. We hope it is instructive, making it easier to understand the purpose and function of our two types of eyedrops.
