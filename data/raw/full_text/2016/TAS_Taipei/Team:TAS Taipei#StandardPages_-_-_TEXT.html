In making our Wiki, we strive to make navigation as simple and intuitive as possible. Therefore, all documentation of our project is placed on main pages accessible through the navigation bar.
Under the project tab, you can reach the background, achievements, collaborations, and parts page, which are all on seperate pages.
Under the experiments, model, human practice, and biosafety tabs, you can access various sections within that page. For example, under human practice, all of research, outreach, and buisness and marketing sections can be accessed, although all three sections are placed on one single page, the human practice page.
Standard Pages
This year, iGEM rules require teams to place all information that are presented to the judges to be placed on static Standard Pages. Below is a table of all Standard Pages, organized by the section which information is pulled from.
