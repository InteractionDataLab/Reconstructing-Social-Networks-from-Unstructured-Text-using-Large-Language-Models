Software
Generalized Nanoparticle Customizer
We built a nanoparticle customizer, which allows you to track the concentration and rates of drug delivery to any part of the body using nanoparticles. You can customize your own design of nanoparticles, and analyze its function inside the body.
These software tools are based off our model results. The specific equations used in this calculator can be found, in the collapsible details in the Model page.
This computational software can be used by future iGEM teams who are interested in using nanoparticles to efficiently deliver their synthesized proteins. The calculational tool is programmed on a Google Spreadsheet. Click the button below to visit the spreadsheet. Please make a copy of the spreadsheet to freely use it.

Cataract - Specific Calculator Tool
We also built two calculators, one for prevention, one for treatment, that is specific to our project.
