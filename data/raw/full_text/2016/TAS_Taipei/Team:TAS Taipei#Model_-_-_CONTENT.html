                            Physicians grade cataracts on a LOCS scale from 0 to 6, with 2.5 usually being the threshold for surgery. This standard method to determine cataract severity is through optical analysis, which is not applicable for chemical analysis. (Chylack)</P><P>The purpose of this model is simple. In Model 2, we find the amount of GSR to maintain in order to ensure a cataract remains below a certain severity. <B>Before we can do that, we must find a way to relate the physical definition of cataract severity (LOCS) to the chemical definition (crystallin damage) in Model 1.</B></P><P>We use literature data to relate LOCS to absorbance, which is still a physical property, but is frequently used in the lab. Then, with experimental data, we relate crystallin damage to absorbance, thus completing the link between the chemical and the physical definitions.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-12"><H3>Quantification of Crystallin Damage</H3><P>Crystallin damage is difficult to quantify, as few literature sources attempt to quantify it. We propose a mathematical way to measure crystallin damage based on how complete the degradation reaction of crystallin is complete depending on the amount of H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>.
                                				            </P><P>Crystallin damage depends on two factors: (1) the <B>amount</B> of H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> crystallin is exposed to, and (2) the <B>time</B> crystallin is exposed to H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>. Therefore, we can mathematically quantify this by integrating the amount of H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> in the crystallin over time:
                                \[c.d.(t) = \int_{0}^{\infty} [H_2O_2]_t dt\]
                            </P><P>We define one unit of crystallin damage to be the equivalent damage caused by exposing the amount of crystallin in the human eyes 1 M of H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> for 1 hour, with units M-h. We make an assumption here, described fully in “Assumptions” #1.</P><P>Note that 1 M-h is a significant amount of crystallin damage, because the concentration of crystallin in the eyes is extremely small, in the neighborhood of 10 uM (Fraunfelder 2008). In addition, the eyes have a naturally occurring antioxidant system that lowers the concentration of H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>, so it will take much longer than an hour of exposure until 1 M-h of crystallin damage is reached.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="crysmenu1" class="tab-pane fade"><H3>Data Documentation</H3><DIV class="col-sm-12"><H4>LOCS to Absorbance</H4><P>The results of <I>Chylack et.

                                    As shown in Table 2, we cannot alter the time to reach equilibrium, or reach full prevention. As supported by literature research, the time to reach equilibrium is a property of the lens that we cannot change (Fraunfelder 2008). However, we propose a <B>two-stage eyedrop approach, of two differing nanoparticle concentrations</B>, to decrease the time needed for full prevention.

                                    The eye is well protected from foreign material attempting to enter the eye. The corneal epithelium is the most essential barrier against topical drugs in eyedrops, and as a result, much of drugs in eyedrops are lost in tear drainage (Lux 2003).

                                    Bioavailability describes the proportion of the drug that reaches the site of action, regardless of the route of administration. For example, it is estimated that only 1-5% of an active drug with small solutes in an eyedrop penetrates the cornea (Bonate 2005). In the case of nanoparticles, which are much larger than chemical molecules, more is lost (Fraunfelder 2008).

                                    To ensure that sufficient concentrations of GSR are delivered, we must place an excess of GSR. To determine how much, we simply divide the concentration of GSR in nanoparticles we found in Model 3 by the fraction of GSR that reaches the aqueous humor.

                                    The mechanism for eyedrop delivery is complex, and there are variances in the bioavailability depending on the conditions of the eye (Fraunfelder 2008). The thickness of the cornea, lens, other eye diseases, age, and even time of day may impact the bioavailability of the drug (Gaudana 2010). We use a stochastic model to simulate Model 3 again, but this time, add a degree of variance. The result is shown in Figure 4.10.

                                    The variance is impacted by the frequency of eyedrops. By giving eyedrops more frequently with less amounts given each time, the variance is decreased.

                                    The models allowed us to extrapolate short-term experimental data to the long-term, to over 50 years, the duration for cataracts to form. In Models 1-2, with the Cataract Lens Experiments on our synthesized protein GSR (and CH25H), we found the amount of synthesized protein needed in the lens over 50 years. In Models 3-4, with the experimental results of a single dose of nanoparticle release, we simulate multiple doses to see the overall change in GSR concentration in the lens over 50 years. We calculate the exact concentrations of our eyedrop prototype, to prevent a LOCS 2.5 cataract from developing so surgery is not needed. With our predictions and simulations of cataract treatment, we offered insights into how the product should be manufactured and used in clinics. We also programmed a nanoparticle customizer to allow the results of these models to be generalized to all drug delivery iGEM projects.
