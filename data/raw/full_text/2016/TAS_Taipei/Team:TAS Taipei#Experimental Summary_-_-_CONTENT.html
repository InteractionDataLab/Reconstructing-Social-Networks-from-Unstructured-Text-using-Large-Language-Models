Once we established their effects, we designed DNA constructs to express glutathione reductase (GSR) and cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H), enzymes that produce GSH and 25HC. We want to directly deliver the proteins, but not bacteria, into the eye. To this end, we made nanoparticles that can package our protein products and deliver them through the cornea and into the eye. In a final proof of concept experiment, we encapsulated GSH and 25HC inside nanoparticles, added these to fish lens solutions, and showed that cataract development is reduced.

                                    The first step of our project was to simulate the formation of cataracts, so that we can test our products in the future. We set up the model by extracting soluble proteins from the lens of Priacanthus macracanthus, a common freshwater fish that we purchased from a market (figure 2.1, left). There are two distinct parts of the lens: an outer soft layer called the cortex and an inner layer called the nucleus (figure 2.1, right). We used the lens nucleus, because it contains older cells and is more prone to cataract formation (Cvekl &amp; Ashery-Padan, 2014). In order to isolate the lens protein, we shook the lens nucleus in Tris buffer overnight and centrifuged the samples (Mello et al., 2012). The supernatant contains dissolved proteins from the lens nucleus. We then added hydrogen peroxide (H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>), the main factor that oxidizes lens proteins and induces cataract formation. 
                                </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><FIGURE class="col-sm-8"><FIGCAPTION class="darkblue"><B>Figure 2.1: Left</B> Our cataract model was set up using fish lens.

                                    To quantify the severity of cataracts in our model, we used a spectrophotometer to measure absorbance values of the lens solution (figure 2.2). As lens proteins become oxidized, absorbance should increase because as proteins aggregate, they fall out of solution, which will scatter incoming light. To find a wavelength of light for data collection, we compared the absorbance of lens solution alone (negative control), H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>-treated lens solution, and heat-denatured lens solution (positive control). We observed an absorbance peak at 397.5 nm for both H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>-treated and heat-denatured solutions, and chose to collect all future absorbance values at that wavelength.

                                    After adding different concentrations of H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>, our results show that increasing concentrations of H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> lead to more severe cataracts (figure 2.3). We also ran a protein gel to compare the sizes of untreated and H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>-treated proteins. After treatment with H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>, there was an increase in higher bands, which is consistent with the idea that proteins are clumping and aggregating (figure 2.4). Together, the protein gel and our absorbance data suggest that our model accurately represents cataract development.

                                    GSH is the main antioxidant in the lens and prevents H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> from oxidizing crystallin proteins. Glutathione reductase (GSR) is the enzyme responsible for making GSH. Older cells in the lens nucleus carry less GSR (Michael &amp; Bron, 2011), which in turn decreases the amount of GSH. This makes the lens nucleus more prone to cataract formation. In order to restore GSH levels, we want to deliver more GSR into the lens.

GSH-treated solutions showed lower absorbance values compared to the untreated control, which indicates less protein aggregation (figure 2.5).

                                    We selected 25HC to be our treatment because it reverses aggregation and can restore the solubility of lens crystallin proteins (Makley et al., 2015). In order to test this, we bought 25HC from Sigma Aldrich and used this in our cataract model. From veterinarians, we learned that commercial eye drops are available for use in pets (OcluVet; figure 2.6), so we wanted to test the effects of 25HC against these eye drops.

Adding pet eye drops did not lower the absorbance as much as treatment with 25HC, suggesting that 25HC is more effective at reducing cataracts. In addition, a higher concentration of 25HC lowered the absorbance even further (50 Î¼M compared to 20 Î¼M). </P></DIV><FIGURE class="col-sm-4"><FIGCAPTION class="darkblue" style="font-color:red"><B>Figure 2.6:</B> OcluVet eye drops are prescribed for pets with cataracts.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><DIV class="row"><FIGURE class="col-sm-8"><FIGCAPTION class="darkblue" style="font-color:red"><B>Figure 2.7:</B> 25HC is more effective at treating cataracts compared to pet eye drops.

                                    GSR catalyzes the formation of GSH, the main antioxidant in the lens. This will prevent crystallin proteins from being oxidized by H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>.

We acquired a strong promoter + strong ribosome binding site part (BBa_K880005) from the iGEM distribution kit to maximize protein production. We ordered the cDNA of GSR from Origene and used the 10x histidine-tag part from the distribution kit (BBa_K844000). A double terminator (BBa_B0015) was added at the end to stop transcription.

However, using the Nanodrop we found no protein in all three elutions. </P><P>Through literature research we learned that 6x his-tag are more commonly used and easier to elute off a column compared to a 10x his-tag (Carlsson et al., 2016). Thus, we hypothesized that our tags bound too strongly to the column. If this were the case, we should see a difference in protein concentration before and after passing his-tagged lysates through the column, whereas lysates containing untagged proteins should not change in protein concentration. After testing this hypothesis, we found that the protein concentration of CRYAB-HIS lysate decreased after passing through the column (figure 3.2), which shows that his-tagged proteins were indeed bound to the column. In contrast, the protein concentrations of CRYAB and GFP lysates remained similar.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><FIGURE class="col-sm-10"><FIGCAPTION class="darkblue"><B>Figure 3.2: Â </B>CRYAB-HIS proteins bind to the nickel column.

                                    The cornea is the outermost layer of the eye and protects the eye from foreign materials, but also prevents drugs from reaching the lens (Gaudana et al., 2010). Scientists have developed several methods to penetrate the cornea and deliver drugs to the lens, but many are invasive, such as implants (Patel et al., 2013). The most promising method is using nanoparticles as drug carriers (Cholkar et al., 2013). so we chose to use nanoparticles to deliver our proteins to the lens.

                                    Nanoparticles can be made from a variety of materials, but we selected chitosan for several reasons. Researchers have used chitosan nanoparticles in the eye; its low toxicity to somatic cells makes it safe and it does not affect the anatomy of the eye (Enriquez de Salamanca et al., 2006).  We also learned that chitosan nanoparticles can embed in the cornea, and its biodegradability allows the drug to be released continuously into the eye (figure 3.3) (Enriquez de Salamanca et al., 2006; Campos et al., 2005). Therefore, we want to load our purified proteins into chitosan nanoparticles (figure 3.4).

                                    Following the procedure of Quan and Wang (2007),  we made nanoparticles and imaged them using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy (figure 3.5). This revealed our nanoparticles to be spherical and at the optimal size of 200-600 nm (figure 3.6 and 3.7).

                                    After proteins are encapsulated, nanoparticles should embed in the cornea and release proteins as they degrade over time. To test whether nanoparticles degrade, we measured the release of proteins. After BSA-containing nanoparticles were made, they were spun down and the solution was replaced with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Wilson, 2014). Using a Bradford assay, we could then measure protein concentration in the PBS over a 72-hour period.

                                    Trials were performed at two different temperatures: 4Â°C and 37Â°C. Our results show that proteins are released from nanoparticles at 37Â°C , but almost no change could be detected at 4Â°C (figure 3.10). This finding suggests that we can store a final functional product (e.g., eye drop) at 4Â°C without nanoparticle degradation, while the proteins can be released from nanoparticles when the eye drop is applied at body temperature.

These result show that, in our cataracts model, the compounds carried inside nanoparticles were released and effective at treating and preventing cataracts.
