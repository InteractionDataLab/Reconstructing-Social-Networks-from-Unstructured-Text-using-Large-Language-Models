Aside from causing damage to healthy tissues, this also exacerbates chronic inflammatory conditions, which keeps producing more GzmB and creates a vicious cycle. Our project aims to selectively inhibit GzmB in the ECM in order to prevent damage during chronic inflammation. Since we do not have the means of working with GzmB and directly testing its interactions in human test subjects, we predicted these interactions using mathematical models and data from the literature.</P><P>The Hill equation is used to model the interaction between a ligand and its binding partner, a macromolecule/enzyme – in our case, how well a GzmB inhibitor binds to GzmB. It is a function of free ligand concentration, and it returns the fraction of macromolecules that are bound. Two constants are involved in this equation: the dissociation constant and the Hill coefficient (Weiss, 1997). </P><P>The Hill coefficient describes cooperativity of the binding. Positive cooperativity (n&gt;1) means that a bound enzyme has higher affinity for other ligands; negative cooperativity (n&lt;1) means the converse is true; and non-cooperative binding (n=0) means that whether or not the enzyme is bound has no bearing on further binding (Weiss, 1997).</P><P>The Hill equation is shown below:

Serpina3n is a known mouse GzmB inhibitor, and the paper documented the effects of Serpina3n on GzmB activity. Given its specificity in mice, this inhibitor was not chosen as part of the final construct, but data from this paper was used because the relevant constants can be analyzed and compared to other inhibitor substitutes.</P><TABLE class="table table-bordered" style="width: 70%;margin-left:15%;"><CAPTION style="caption-side:top;"><B>Table 1: A really cool looking graph. </B></CAPTION><TBODY><B><TR><TD>[Sa3n] (nM)</TD><TD>0.4</TD><TD>1.4</TD><TD>2.8</TD><TD>3.8</TD><TD>5</TD><TD>7.8</TD><TD>10</TD><TD>16</TD><TD>21</TD><TD>40</TD><TD>80</TD></TR><TR><TD>Relative GzmB Activity (%)</TD><TD>118</TD><TD>110</TD><TD>115</TD><TD>102</TD><TD>78</TD><TD>76</TD><TD>65</TD><TD>56</TD><TD>39</TD><TD>15</TD><TD>4</TD></TR></B></TBODY></TABLE><P>Several adjustments were made to the equation and dataset so that we could have a meaningful model.  First, GzmB activity was shown as percentages ranging from 10% to 120% in the paper. This is likely because the control for the experiment was set at some point where the Serpina3n expression is not 0. Thus, we scaled down the data points by a factor of 1/120. This scaling is necessary since the Hill equation returns a fraction; the output is limited to between 0 and 1.</P><P>More importantly, since the data was presented as the concentration of enzymes that remain free after binding, we needed to modify the Hill equation in order to model the fraction of unbound GzmB. Since <I>bound + unbound = 100%</I>, and the Hill equation models the bound component, it can be said that , provided that the dataset is properly scaled to a range between 100%-0%.</P><P>The FindFit function of Mathematica was used to find the unknown constants Kd and n for the modified Hill equation above. Our model returned a Kd of ≈ 28.130 and n ≈ 1.3540. The final equation is , where θ<SUB>free</SUB> is GzmB activity and [L] stands for concentration of Serpina3n (Figure 1).</P><FIGURE class="col-sm-10"><FIGCAPTION class="darkblue"><B>Figure 1.

The dataset obtained from the ACT3m paper (Marcet-Palacios <I>et al.</I>, 2014) is the result of a colorimetric assay. Data was presented as absorbance values (A<SUB>405</SUB>), which correspond to the concentration of free GzmB, at different inhibitor concentrations. The paper used this to prove that their novel ACT3m inhibitor was the strongest out of their entire pool of possible candidates: treatment with ACT3m resulted in the lowest A<SUB>405</SUB> values, which suggests the strongest inhibition of GzmB.</P><P>To model this set of data, similar adjustments had to be made. First, the dataset was scaled so the numbers ranged between 0 and 1 (in this case, increased by a factor of 2). The same modified Hill equation was used from the Serpina3n analysis. Our model returned a Kd of ≈ 13.336 and n ≈ 0.605, so the equation looks like (Figure 2).</P><FIGURE class="col-sm-10"><FIGCAPTION class="darkblue"><B>Figure 2.

In this context, Kd represents [Gzmb<SUB>free</SUB>][Inhibitor]/[Gzmb<SUB>inhib</SUB>-Inhibitor] at equilibrium (Bisswanger, 2008); therefore, a lower Kd would represent better inhibition: more bound GzmB compared to free GzmB.</P><P>We can also analyze the Ka, the association constant. Ka is the inverse of Kd, and can be found as [Gzmb<SUB>inhib</SUB>-Inhibitor]/ [Gzmb<SUB>free</SUB>][Inhibitor]. This represents the relative amount of bound molecules, so that a higher Ka represents stronger binding affinity. Compared to the mouse inhibitor Serpina3n, human ACT3m has a lower Kd and a higher Ka, which suggests stronger inhibition. This conclusion is in agreement with Marcet-Palacios <I>et al.</I>, where this novel inhibitor was also compared to mouse Serpina3n (2014).</P><P>The Hill constant may also be considered to analyze the nature of the inhibitor-GzmB complex. With n&gt;1, Serpina3n is likely to bind to multiple sites on GzmB (Weiss <I>et al.</I>, 1997). ACT3m, in contrast, has a n&lt;1, meaning that it likely binds competitively to selective and perhaps singular sites. This information is interesting; taking the association constants into account, this means that despite less opportunity to bind, ACT3m still acts as a better inhibitor than Serpina3n.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12"><H2 id="calculator">Inhibitor Concentration Calculator</H2><P class="col-sm-12">The following equations were developed with a question in mind:</P><H3 class="col-sm-8 purple" style="color:white; padding: 20px">How much inhibitor is needed to bring GzmB levels back to normal?</H3><P class="col-sm-12">Since there are many diseases that cause inflammation, and thus increased levels of GzmB, we created a calculator to determine the amount of treatment needed for any GzmB-related diseases.

This equation calculates the inhibitor concentration that corresponds to a certain relative level of GzmB. </P><P class="col-sm-12">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the main chronic inflammatory diseases made worse by elevated GzmB activity. We will use this as an example to show how the calculator works. GzmB concentrations in synovial fluids (joint fluids) of arthritis patients were determined from Tak <I>et al.</I>, 2009 (summarized in Table 3). There is a significant GzmB concentration difference between the control group and RA patients. The equation that returns a concentration of inhibitor can be used here, as it takes in relative GzmB levels and returns the amount of inhibitor needed.</P><TABLE class="table table-bordered" style="width: 70%;margin-left:15%;"><CAPTION style="caption-side:top;"><B>Table 3: GzmB Concentration in Synovial Fluids.</B> GzmB concentration in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis obtained from Tak <I>et al.</I>, 2009.</CAPTION><THEAD><TR><TH>Rheumatoid arthritis (pg/mL)</TH><TH>Control (pg/mL)</TH></TR></THEAD><TBODY><TR><TD>Mean +/- s.d.</TD><TD>3306 +/- 10311</TD><TD>34 +/- 32</TD></TR><TR><TD>Median</TD><TD>251</TD><TD>29</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>If a patient has a GzmB level that is X times the amount of control (around 34 pg/mL), then proportionally, X/100% = 100%/Y, where Y is the factor we want to decrease the patient’s level by (relative to his original level). Therefore,  , and the amount of inhibitor needed [L] can be calculated. For example, if an RA patient has a GzmB concentration of 3400 pg/mL, then the patient has about 100x the normal GzmB level. Therefore, the Y factor would be 1%, and [L] can be calculated to be around 130 uM.</P><P>It should be noted, however, that there is a large standard deviation for GzmB levels in RA patients, which means there are significant variations: if treatments are to be given, it would be better to conduct treatments on a case-by-case basis.</P><DIV style="border-style:solid; text-align:center; padding:20px"><H4 style="padding:0">CALCULATOR</H4><SPAN>Patient's GzmB level is </SPAN><SPAN>% of original</SPAN><BUTTON onclick="calculateee()">Calculate!</BUTTON><SPAN>Treatment ([L]) : </SPAN><B><SPAN id="calcResults">      </SPAN></B><SPAN>nM of ACT</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12"><H2 id="flux">Bandage Flux Model</H2><P>Now that we know how to calculate the amount of treatment necessary, we can estimate how we apply our prototype to deliver the appropriate amount of treatment.</P><P>Fick’s first law dictates that , where J is the diffusion rate (flux) across the membrane (Lonsdale <I>et al.</I>).
