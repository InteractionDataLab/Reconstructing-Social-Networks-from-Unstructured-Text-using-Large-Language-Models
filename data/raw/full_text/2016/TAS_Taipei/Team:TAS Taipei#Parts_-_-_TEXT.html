Medal Parts Requirements
Each submitted part has been properly documented on the registry - click on the part number in the table above. Specifically, in regards to judging requirements (click links to see full documentation)
BBa_K1898100 , BBa_K1898150 , BBa_K1898200 , BBa_K1898250 , BBa_K1898300 , BBa_K1898400 are submitted as new standard biobrick parts. (BRONZE requirement)
We experimentally validated our new device, BBa_K1898450 . (SILVER requirement)
We improved the characterization of an existing part, BBa_K844000 . Particularly, we documented that adding the histidine tag does not change the function of the attached protein. (GOLD requirement).
