Protocols
Phosphorylation and Ligation
Phosphorylate, ligate and transform immediately after each other
Modified Phosphorylation Procedure:
150 ng DNA
3 uL T4 ligase buffer
1 uL T4 PNK
Water to 30 uL
Run at 37°C for 1 hour
Ligation: (into storage vectors-pSB1K3)
20 uL reaction volume:
50 ng backbone (linearized pSB1K3 at 25 ng/uL from iGEM)
*Use NEBioCalculator, 3:1 insert:backbone molar ratio
2 uL T4 ligase buffer
1 uL T4 ligase
Water to 20 uL
Run for 15 minutes (max 30) at room temperature
Heat to inactivate at 80°C for 20 minutes or transform immediately
