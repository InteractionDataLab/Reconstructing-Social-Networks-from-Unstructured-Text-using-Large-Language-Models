Tasks:
Jordan
Updated inventory I’ve used this week
Read GG protocol again
Discovered with Paul that the incubator has been unplugged for at least 3 days
Michelle
GFP Gel extraction
GFP1:
0.1541 g dissolved in 0.4623 mL GEX
0.1838 g dissolved in 0.5514 mL GEX
GFP2: 0.2071 g dissolved in 0.6213 mL GEX
GFP3: 0.1640 g dissolved in 0.4920 mL GEX
GFP4: 0.1186 g dissolved in 0.3558 mL GEX
Used Epoch’s kit w/ team procedure modifications:
Washed with WS twice
Let stand for each wash for 1 minute
Let stand before spinning for elution for 5 minutes
Eluted in 20 μL of n.f. water instead of elution buffer
Results:
GFP1: 72.2 ng/μL, 260/280: 1.93, 260/230: 1.61
GFP2: 86.0 ng/μL, 260/280: 1.87, 260/230: 1.40
GFP3: 40.0 ng/μL, 260/280: 1.84, 260/230: 1.00
GFP4: 7.1 ng/μL, 260/280: 1.92, 260/230: 1.19
Ran GFP4 PCR again:
25 μL 2X OneTaq Mastermix
1 μL 10 μM forward primer
1 μL 10 μM reverse primer
1 μL DMSO
1 μL GFP template
21 μL nfH2O
95°C (2:00) | 95°C (0:07), 51°C (0:10), 72°C (0:43) | 72°C (5:00)
Ran gel on GFP4 re-attempt
Ladders: 2 μL NEB Purple 2-log ladder + 6 μL NEB 6X Blue Loading Dye
Loaded: 25 μL PCR reaction + 5μL NEB 6X Blue Loading Dye
Gel extracted GFP4
Lane 2: 0.0665 g dissolved in 0.1995 mL GEX
Lane 4: 0.1378 g dissolved in 0.4134 mL GEX

Paul
DpnI digest pSB1T3 linearized BB
Sara
Updated the lab notebook and also added a few protocols
Tasfia
Human practices
Released queries for experts in antibiotic resistance via journalists’ online source database ~ awaiting responses but it could be awhile
Sent emails to hopefully interview experts (clinical nurses, because we haven’t touched on them yet, but I plan to do more research on antibiotic resistance before I reach out to Medical Advisory Committees)
Updated document called “Planning/Brainstorming” with ideas, snippets of antibiotic resistance in current events, brainstormed methods
Tyler
Ordered Tat, Sec, Tat/Sec SS w/Cas9 homology, finalized DsbA with Cas9 homology design and ordered that too
Sponsor comm w/Bio-Rad, picked up western blot gels
Researched translocation pathways, chose optimal sequences
