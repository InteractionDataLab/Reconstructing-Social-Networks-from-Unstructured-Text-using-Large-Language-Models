Jordan
Ligate YcdO-Cas9 into pSB1C3
Used a 2:1 molar ratio of insert/backbone
YcdO-Cas9 with BB ends insert calculated as 3300 bp
SB1C3 at 2100 bp
10 uL reaction volume
Used "YcdO Cas9, EcoRI SpeI PP 10.3" restriction digest from Paul
2 uL (~80 ng)
Used pSB1C3 EcoRI/SpeI digest PP
10.3, 5 uL (25 ng)
1.5 uL water
1 uL T4 ligase buffer
0.5 uL T4 ligase
Incubating at 25째C for 20 minutes, heat kill at 80째C for 20 minutes
YcdO concentration in restriction digest was at ~40 ng/ul
Transform pSB1C3-YcdO-Cas9 into Top10
Transformed with 3 ul of ligation product
30 second heat shock
1 hr 15 recovery
900uL SOC, plated 450uL
Plates are titled "YcdO-Cas9 in SB1C3 for sequencing/shipping, TOP10"
Ligate gRNA template and gRNA guide into pSB1C3
gRNA guide and gRNA template ratios calculated with 150 bp, SB1C3 calculated with 2100 bp
Used 2:1 molar ratio of insert:backbone
10 uL reaction volume
"gRNA temp EcoRI SpeI PP 10.3," 2 ul (3.6 ng)
"gRNA EcoRI SpeI PP 10.3," 2 ul (3.6 ng)
Restriction digest concentrations were diluted:
1:5 for gRNA guide
Initial: 230 ng in 25 uL reaction=~9 ng/uL to a concentration of 1.8 ng/ul
1:50 for gRNA temp
Initial conc. 2350ng in 25 uL=~90 ng/uL to a concentration of 1.8 ng/ul
Used 5ul of "pSB1C3 EcoRI SpeI PP 10.3" (25 ng)
1.5 ul water
1 ul T4 ligase buffer
0.5 ul T4 ligase
Incubating 25째C for 20 minutes, heat kill at 80째C for 20 minutes.
Ligate gRNA template and gRNA guide into pSB1C3 (again)
Redid above, but calculated both insert ratios with 1100 bp
Did not dilute RNA guide, used 3 ul for ~27 ng insert
Did dilute RNA temp 1:10, but then forgot and used undiluted product.
Increased reaction volume to 20 ul with water, used 2 ul of buffer
Added 3 ul or 270 ng (ten times as much insert as needed)
Transform ligated gRNA products into Top10
Transformed with 3 ul of ligation product
30 second heat shock
1 hr 15 recovery
900 uL SOC, plated 450 uL
Plates are titled "BBP-mRFP-gRNA-guide/temp-BBs in SB1C3 for seq/shipping, TOP 10"
Grow up new overnight cultures (2 of each) for pET28a-Cas9 (BL21) and pET28a-DsbA-Cas9 (BL21) and TorA-Cas9 in pSB1C3 (Top10) and DsbA-Cas9 in pSB1C3 (Top10)
Grew up new cultures in order to re-miniprep for reasonable concentrations
Paul
Transform pSB1C3-Cas9 into JC8031
Transformed 1 uL of "Cas9 plasmid miniprep MC 9.2.16 358.9 ng/uL" (I forgot to dilute the sample oops) into JC8031, and 50 pg of pUC19 [Amp] control into Top10 as transformation control. Recovered in 900 uL SOC, plated 450 uL.
Restriction digest for YcdO-Cas9 into pSB1C3
Used "YcdO SD" from PCR purified box 5 ul=~1 ug DNA, digest with 1 uL EcoRI HF and slightly < 1 uL SpeI HF from Kelly
Restriction digest for gRNA-template & gRNA-guide into pSB1C3
10 uL of gRNA 10 JH (23 ng/uL)
10 uL of "gRNA template MC 9/2 (235 ng/uL)
5 uL of linearized pSB1C3 from iGEM (25 ng/uL)
*used 1 uL Spei GQ Promega from box because we ran out of SpeI HF from Kelly*
Tasfia
Miniprep TorA-Cas9 in pSB1C3(Top10) and DsbA-Cas9 in pSB1C3 (Top10)
Miniprep pET28a-Cas9 (BL21) and pET28a-DsbA-Cas9 (BL21)
