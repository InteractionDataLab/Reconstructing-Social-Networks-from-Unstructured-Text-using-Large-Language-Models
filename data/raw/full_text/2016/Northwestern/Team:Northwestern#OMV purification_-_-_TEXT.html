Protocols
Adapted Extracellular Vesicle preparation protocol:
Grow desired volume of E. coli liquid culture until mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.5-0.8)
Take note of exact OD600
Pellet the cells gently (approx. 6,000 g) for 5 minutes
Recover as much supernatant as possible without disturbing the cell pellet
Leave some supernatant behind if necessary
Take note of the volume recovered
Filter the supernatant using a 0.22 µm syringe filter unit to remove any remaining cells
Change unit if and whenever it clogs
Equilibrate a 14 kDa centrifugal filter unit with PBS
Concentrate the filtered supernatant with the centrifugal filter unit following manufacturer’s instructions
Once all the supernatant has been concentrated, if desired, buffer exchange using the same centrifugal filter unit (e.g. with PBS prior to a SDS-PAGE)
Sample is ready for analysis.
