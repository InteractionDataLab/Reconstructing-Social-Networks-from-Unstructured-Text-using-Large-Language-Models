Friday, June 24th
Agenda:
Split Cas9 construct and research
Review experiment presentation
Research questions
Safety sheets
Interlab
Edit GenScript grant
Integrated human practices
Website
iGEM kit DNA concentration?
Go through kit, look for enzymes
Tasks:
Sara
Searched for rapamycin-inducible dimer Cas9
Helped with some of the Gibson Cas9 constructs
Watched Genome Compiler tutorials
Paul
Worked on presentation
Tasfia
Worked on GenScript
Helped Jordan with iGEM Interlab data colllection
Helped Sara make Cas9 split parts and modified Tat and Sec parts on Genome Compiler
Michelle
Searched the iGEM 2016 plates for practice material
Website CSS reading
Research on OMV formation and uptake for Patrick
Tyler
Revised presentation/experimental procedure
Redesigned proteins fusions
Ran Gibson on split Cas9, generated usable primers
Met with Promega, emailed them needed products
Shu
Sorted out the stuff in the freezer
Researched on potential membrane proteins
Sam
Reviewed the presentation and prepared to present
Presented to Jewett
Wrote to Jennifer
Got worried about the DNA concentrations and whether we need to PCR more DNA, and as a result, whether we need to design a bunch of primers ASAP
Helped edit GenScript
Jordan
Sampled the Interlab cell culture every hour for six hours
Interlab almost done!
Looked a little bit at the GenScript app
Watched some Genome Compiler tutorials
