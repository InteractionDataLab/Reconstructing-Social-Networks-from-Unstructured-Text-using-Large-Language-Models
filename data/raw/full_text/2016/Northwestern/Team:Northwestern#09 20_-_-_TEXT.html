Tasks:
Jordan
Helped make competent Delisa cells
Ligated Cas9 and pSB1C3 restriction digests
25 ng pSB1C3 (2ul)
37 ng Cas9 insert (1.86 uL)
1 ul T4 ligase buffer
0.5 ul T4 ligase
4.64 ul water
1:1 insert:vector
16°for 30 minutes, heat kill 80°C 20 minutes
Sam
Electroporated 4 lines of cells with Paul
Skipped the negative control because the Jewett lab only had 4 electroporation cuvettes
Sara
Poured a gel to screen the clyA-PET28a PCR
3 uL sybersafe
5 uL product, 1 uL dye
6 uL ladder, 3 uL dye
The gel showed that the PCR did not work
Made more 1% agarose (400 mL)
Tasfia
Made competent cells out of DeLisa strain (with Paul and Jordan)
Transformed ligation product (Cas9 into pSB1C3 iGEM backbone for part submission), 3 μL DNA
Transformed pSB1C3 competent cell test plasmid to examine efficiency of DeLisa competent cells
Picked more colonies of gRNA+Cas9 cotransformation, and with existing overnight cultures made 2.5-mL aliquots to give cultures more air in the tubes
