Notebook
Friday, July 22nd
Tasks:
Jordan
Met with Josh
Calculated transformation efficiency
Finished CLP letter, pending review
Emailed iGEM alums
Michelle
Made primers for extracting SS from GFP parts
Started inventory on the freezer
Sam
Met with Josh
Emailed Prof. DeLisa
Drafted an email to Eligo Bioscience
Sara
Miniprepped the 6 Cas9 Gibson cultures
Ran the restriction digest of the cas9 Gibson product again
Tasfia
Ran restriction digest of Gibson assembly Cas9(1)/Cas9(2)/Tet backbone with Sara
Recipe for 25-uL reaction
0.6 uL undiluted (1730 ng/uL, so ~1ug) Gibson product
Diluted Gibson product from day before was ~43 ng/uL, but wasnâ€™t used for digest because we had less than 20 uL of it remaining
2.5 uL 10x buffer [CutSmart or NEBuffer4 (two digests were run with two different buffers)]
CutSmart 10x
NEBuffer4 10x
1 uL EcoR1 restriction enzyme
20.9 uL nuclease-free water
Ran two unsuccessful gels
First try: ladder bled through to the second (CutSmart) well
Second try: no DNA showed up (like yesterday), but ladder was fluorescent
Transformed sfGFP and mCherry plasmids with Shu
50 uL cells in each CamR plate (one plate for each plasmid)
Followed bootcamp protocol with 50 uL cells and 450 uL SOC
Read some high-level antimicrobial resistance stuff to justify our project motivations for wiki
yesterday
back to calendar
tomorrow
