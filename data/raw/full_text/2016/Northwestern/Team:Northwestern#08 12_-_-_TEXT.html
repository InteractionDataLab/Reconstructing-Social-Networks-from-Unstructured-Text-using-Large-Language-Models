1 uL lin Cas9 BB (~50 ng)
0.6 uL SS (all 10 ng/uL)
8.4 uL water

Autoclaved LB+agar for Cam plates
Sam
Diluted Paul’s saltwater to 50mM by adding 2.5 mL of the autoclaved di water
Made 1x TAE—still 100 mL of old 1x TAE in there with the new batch
Helped Michelle with abstract
Emailed Quentin to get the Jewett lab loading dye formula
Worked on human practices
Finally emailed Will
Followed up with Sarah Sutton
Sara
Transformed the 15 Golden Gate products and their controls with Tyler
Followed boot camp transformation protocol
Used SOC from Patrick
Used 200 uL SOC and plated 250 uL volume total
Transformed immediately, 5 uL of product per transformation
Also transformed a + control plasmid from NEB, 2uL
Excess product was stored in the freezer. Tubes were labelled as follows:
mCherry1
mCherry2
mCherry3
mCherry4
mCherry5
