Monday, August 15th
Agenda:
Glycerol stocks of Cas9
Miniprep Cas9
Miniprep Tet BB
PCR Linearize Tet for GFP
PCR mRFP
Retransform Cas9-with-SS Gibson
PCR linearize for ClyA
Clean out fridge
PCR linearize mRFP backbone
DpnI digest
Run gel and gel extract
Gibson the gRNA with template
Transform
Tasks:
Paul
PCR linearize Tet BB for GFP
3 tubes A: (In this order in the gel)
Original template
New template
Half primer concentration (0.25 uL each 10 uM primer)
1 tube B: original template
DpnI digest at 37 C for 2 hours
Retransform:
Gibson + control (5 uL)
Gibson - control (no insert) (3 uL)
pUC19 (1 uL, 50 pg/uL)
GG no ligase control (5 uL)
GG no insert control (5 uL)
GG m1 (5 uL)
*heat shock for 30 s instead of 45
Recover at 37 C in 200 uL SOC
*Didn’t have enough Cam plates so we used different concentrations

Human Practices
Sara
Cleaned out the fridge/bleached plates
Worked on the lab notebook
Overnight cultures of the Cas9 glycerol stocks
Ran a miniprep for each tube of culture, one with water and one with elution buffer
89 ng/uL with water elution, 25 ng/uL with elution buffer elution
