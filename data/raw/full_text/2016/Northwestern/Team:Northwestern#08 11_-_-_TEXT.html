Team:Northwestern/08 11
Notebook
Thursday, August 11th
Tasks:
Paul
Submitted sequencing of the 08.09 miniprep (w/ antibiotic) of Jordan’s 1:3 Gibson
“1”= VF’
“2”= Cas9_Seq1
“3”= Cas9_Seq2
“4”= Cas9_Seq3
PCR of Tet lnrz for GFP (DpnI for 2 hr @ 37°C)
Presentation for profs
Sam
Provided Building with Biology to UNSW (and verified that you’re allowed to do that)
Told them about our experiences so far
Updated outreach log
Improved Collaboration slide in presentation
Updated Jamboree costs spreadsheet
Additional Eligo editing
Autoclaved Paul’s NaCl the normal way (and also some nearby diH2O just for kicks)
Found out that autoclaving kills DNases but not RNases
Sara
Made GG PCR parts fmol dilutions
Tyler
