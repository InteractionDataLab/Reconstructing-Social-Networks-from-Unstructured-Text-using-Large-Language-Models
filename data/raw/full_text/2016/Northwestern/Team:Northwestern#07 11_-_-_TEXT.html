Agenda:
Do more research on/ask more grad students for a gRNA plasmid for reporter
Cloning practice
Email grad students
Linearize Tet plasmid
Genedrive prep
Group picture
Pick up the plates
Tasks:
Michelle
CSS research
Paul
Researched gene drives
PCR for linearizing Tet backbone
Sam
Researched gene drives
Learned about alternative Cas systems (other than Cas9)
Learned CSS
Sara
Learned about malaria
Prepared for the gene drive meeting tomorrow
Read more about Cas9
Tasfia
Linearized Tet backbone
Wrote lab notes for Experiment
Tyler
Ordered BB Primers
E-mailed CGM and received confirmation on running 100-200 sequencing reactions
Looked into possible experiments for testing functionality of Cas9 (pulled together material for a possible mRFP test)
Finalized sequencing primers for Cas9, sent them to Kelly
Watched a few videos of the basics of simbiology
Began to read about saCas9 and how it functions
yesterday
back to calendar
tomorrow
