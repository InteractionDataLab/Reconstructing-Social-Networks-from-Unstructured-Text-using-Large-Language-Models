Protocols
Gel Electrophoresis
Pouring a Gel:
Determine gel size and well size, insert cassette into tray
Add 0.01% SYBR-Safe to the final gel volume (about 30mL gel volume for a 10-well gel → 1–3uL SybrSafe)
Mix with the pipette tip, moving bubbles to a corner
Cover to cool for 10–15 min
Check to make sure the gel is fully solidified and appears uniform before removing the well comb
Turn the gel cassette so the wells are oriented toward the negative electrode (run to red)
Cover with 1X TAE until the gel is fully covered by a few mm of buffer
Running a Gel:
Plug in cassette, run at 100V
Check to make sure you are running to RED 
Check to make sure bubbles are forming at electrodes
Cover to run
Run for 15–20 minutes, but check loading dye progress
Visualizing a Gel:
Remove the gel from the electrophoresis chamber
Place in the viewing machine, select blue/UV light and set time to ~1 second
Adjust exposure until just a few pixels are saturated
Take picture and label the gels
Turn off the blue/UV light and clean everything
