Results:
The Gibson reaction plates have no visible colonies.
Tasks:
Sara & Shu
Ran mCherry colonies along with one PCR reaction from the first attempt at colony PCR (m1' and G1')
Ran 3 controls:
No DNA- the PCR reaction contained everything but template DNA
Positive control- DNA straight from the iGEM kit containing RFP, which is a similar size to our desired inserts (J04450 in pSB1K3)
Backbone- Which was only the pSB1K3 backbone
