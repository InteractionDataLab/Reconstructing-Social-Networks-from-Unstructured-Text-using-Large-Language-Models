Sequencing Results:
Cas9 Gibson cultures A1, A2, A3, A5, B1, B2, B3, B5: Only the BBprefix_FWD primer gave us clean results, showing that the Cas9 was not successfully inserted into the linearized backbone. We realized that we used circular DNA in the Gibson assembly.
Tasks:
Jordan
Transformed the GFP and mCherry ligations
Ran all 9 tests, did a backbone-only ligation control, a plate with no DNA, and a control from the competent cell test (on Cam)
Transformed 4 uL of plasmid DNA each, 1 uL for no DNA and comp cell controls
Long ice incubation step because water bath wasn’t ready yet, ~45 minutes
