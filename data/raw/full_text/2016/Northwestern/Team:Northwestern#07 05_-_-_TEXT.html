Notebook
Tuesday, July 5th
Agenda:
Meet with Taylor to make      legit comp cells (11 am)
Skype the Purdue iGEM team (1      pm)
Use the plate reader for the      Interlab
Make Golden Gate primers
Work on Gibson primers and      overhangs
Tasks:
Jordan
Made competent cells with Taylor
Crowdfunding stuff
Made Experiment centrifuge video
Michelle
Prepared competent cells aliquots with Taylor
Website reading
Finished ClyA homology
Created signaling sequence homology
Checked existing primers and constructs
Paul
Designed GFP Golden Gate Primers
Designed GFP flexible linker primers
Communicated w/ Purdue
Got familiar w/ Genome Compiler
Sam
Plate reader for Interlab
Researched potential outreach people
Researched Gibson assembly
Talked to Purdue
Mosquito forum stuff for Building with Biology outreach
Sara
Worked on Golden Gate constructs
Went to the Skype call with Purdue
Tasfia
ClyA plasmid and homology
Prepared competent cells that hopefully actually work this time
Updated slideshow
Researched Golden Gate assembly
Tyler
E-mailed Feinberg about free sequencing
Made slight changes to split Cas9 sequence
Generated Primers for opening plasmid at SS (have to redo tomorrow because change in RBS sequence)
Reviewed signal sequences with homology arms
yesterday
back to calendar
tomorrow
