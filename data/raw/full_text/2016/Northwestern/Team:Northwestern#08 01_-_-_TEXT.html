Tasks:
Jordan
Gibson reaction on 7.30 linearized tet backbone and Cas9 1+2
Insert:vector = 3:1
Backbone conc. 41 ng/uL
Used 50 ng backbone or 1.2 uL
Followed NEB kit protocol
Neg. Control- 1.2 ul vector + 8.8 ul water + 10 uL MasterMix
Positive control- 10 ul DNA provided in kit in 10 ul MasterMix
Incubated in water bath at 50 deg. 1 hour
Transformed Gibson product
One test condition, four controls
Actual Cas9 assembly—transformed 5 uL
Negative control Gibson with backbone only, should get no or few colonies—5 uL
Positive control from Gibson kit, should get colonies—5 uL
No DNA transformed, should not get colonies—1 uL
J04450 in pSB1C3- positive control, should get colonies—1uL
Plated 100 uL of each transformation
Michelle
Ran gel of Sara and Sam's 7.31 GFP and mCherry PCR
50 uL PCR reaction per piece + 10 uL of 6X Blue Loading Dye
25 uL loaded in each well
2 ladders run per gel, 2uL of 2kb ladder + 6uL 6X Blue Loading Dye
Realized that Sara and Sam did not put template in, so the primer dimers on the gels made sense
 
Re-ran the PCR of the Tet Backbone Linearization for GFP/mCherry with Tyler
2, 50µL reactions
20 μL water
1 μL DMSO
2 μL tet backbone
1 μL 10 μM fwd primer
1 μL 10 μM rev primer
25 μL OneTaq master mix
Negative Control (Water)
22 μL water
1 μL DMSO
1 μL fwd primer
1 μL rev primer
25 μL OneTaq master mix
Same conditions as previous PCR, but increased the start and end annealing temperatures by 1°C
Took notes on Parallax scrolling, image transitioning in HTML and CSS—Started website
Paul
Ran a gel of GFP and mCherry PCR product with Sam
4 wells per GFP/mCherry, 25 uL per well
mCherry seems to have worked, GFP did not
 
Looked over Cas9 Signaling Sequence primers: lots of primer dimers-probably easier/better to synthesize whole things
Investigate other SS
Feedback during group discussion
Got caught up from weekend work
Sam
Autoclaved TAE
PCR of GFP/mCherry
25 uL OneTaq
1 uL diluted 10 mM f primer
1 uL diluted 10 mM r primer
1 uL GFP/mCherry
21 uL dH20
1 uL DMSO
95°C (2:00) | 95°C (0:07), 51°C (0:10), 72°C (0:43) | 72°C (5:00)
DpnI digest: 1 uL of DpnI added to each of the 50uL tubes. Incubated in the 37 for 4 hours
Ran gel on GFP/mCherry PCR with Paul
Sara
Ran a PCR of GFP and mCherry to put on the GG ends with Sam
Talked to Patrick to get more Dpn1 to use on the GFP mCherry PCR
Learned that we’ve been using too much Dpn1, and Patrick suggested using 1 uL per 100 uL tube
Tasfia
PCR Tet Backbone Linearization for GFP/mCherry with Tyler
Reactions
10 μL water
0.5 μL DMSO
1 μL tet backbone
0.5 μL 10 μM fwd primer
0.5 μL 10 μM rev primer
12.5 μL OneTaq master mix
Negative control for 25-μL reaction (1 tube)
11 μL water
0.5 μL DMSO
0.5 μL fwd primer
0.5 μL rev primer
12.5 μL OneTaq master mix
DpnI digest on PCR product (added 1 μL DpnI in each reaction tube)
Ran a gel on the PCR product of Tet Backbone Linearization for GFP/mCherry
Two 8-μL ladders on each side of gel; 1:3 purple 2-log ladder to 6X blue loading dye
Each well had ~28 μL PCR product + loading dye (~26 PCR product + ~5.2 μL 6X blue loading dye)
95 V
Ran for ~1 hour
Tyler
PCR Tet Backbone Linearization for GFP/mCherry with Thush
Gel on Tet linearization with Thush
PCR of the Tet Backbone Linearization for GFP/mCherry with Michelle
Reviewed SS cas9 parts
yesterday
back to calendar
tomorrow
