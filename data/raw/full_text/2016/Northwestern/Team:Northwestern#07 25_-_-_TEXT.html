Team:Northwestern/07 25
Notebook
Monday, July 25th
Agenda:
Check the GG storage vector
Freezer inventory
Figure out sequencing of Cas9
Review constructs
Human practices
Find protocols for next steps
Design sequencing primers for the GFP construct
Ligate GFP and mCherry parts into the storage vector
Look into Weinberg and Provost travel grants
Tasks:
Jordan
Discovered pSB1A3 contains BsaI site, not suitable for GFP storage vector
Looked for periplasmic lysis protocols
Scheduled call with Dr. Persell
Michelle
Freezer inventory & organization
Paul
Figured out sequencing submission process
Planned ligation
Planned gRNA plasmid
Sam
Emailed profs regarding Eligo Bioscience
Prepped questions for Dr. Persell
Website work
Troubleshot gel imager
Proposed that gels should be ran at a lower voltage for longer duration in order to prevent “band smiling”
Sara
PCR of GFP and mCherry
Miniprep of overnight BB part cultures:
GFP concentration: 39.7 ng/uL, 260/280: 2.02, 260/230: 1.44
mCherry concentration: 38 ng/uL, 260/280: 1.9, 260/230: 1.01
Procedure:
2.5 uL 10X PCR buffer
0.5 uL 10 mM DNTPs
0.5 uL of forward primer at 10 mM
0.5 uL of reverse primer at 10 mM
0.5 uL template (Shu's miniprep GFP and mCherry products)
0.25 Taq polymerase
20.25 uL H20
PCR settings:
Denature: 95 C, 7 s.
Anneal: 51 C, 43 s.
Elongate 72 C, 2 m.
Made 400 mL 1% agarose with Shu
Poured 2 gels
Ran a gel of the PCR products
GFP3 and 4 did not have bands in the correct place, so we reran PCR on them and on GFP 2, which had a lower concentration and 260/230 ratio than the rest
We plan to troubleshoot by changing the voltage we’re running at and using newly diluted TAE
