Wednesday, July 27th
Agenda:
Pour 2 gels for GFP and mCherry
PCR linearization of the Tet-Cas9 backbone in preparation for insertion of ClyA or INP/signaling sequences
PCR Cleanup of GG gels
Tasks:
Jordan
Designed ClyA sequencing primers
Ran gel extraction/cleanup on mCherry’s (Shu did GFPs), followed kit procedure, used 30 ul water not elution buffer, added more buffer up to about 500 ul
Looked into more fractionation procedures Ligation
Michelle
Made glycerol stocks of A1–A3, A5, B1–B3, B5 Cas9 cultures
500 μL overnight culture
500 μL 50% glycerol in dH2O
In microcentrifuge tube stored in -80°C in Mordacq’s lab, in box marked 2016 iGEM Glycerol Stocks
Researched Cas9 expression & purification protocols
Cas9–INP and Cas9–ClyA Gibson math
Made 5mL cultures of Cas9 from glycerol stocks with Sara
50 μL Cam in 5 mL LB
Cultures A3, A5, B2
Ran mCherry & sfGFP PCR
0.5 μL of 10 μM forward primer
0.5 μL of 10 μM reverse primer
1 μL template (sfGFP or mCherry miniprep)
12.5 μL of OneTaq Master Mix
10.5 μL nuclease-free water
95°C (2:00) | 95°C (0:07),  51°C (0:10),  72°C (0:43) | 72°C (5:00)
25 μL reaction volume, 25 cycles
Aliquoted 100 mL of LB for autoclaving to grow up Cas9 tomorrow
Aliquoted LB into smaller bottles for autoclaving tomorrow
Paul
Looked up Cas9 expression procedure
Ran gel on mCherry and GFP PCR products
Helped out with various experiments
Sara
PCR of Tet-Cas9 backbone with Tyler
Used DNA from B2 and A5 overnight cultures
Made 5mL cultures of Cas9 from glycerol stocks with Michelle
50 μL Cam in 5 mL LB
Cultures A3, A5, B2
Shu
Gel extracted sfGFP for Golden Gate assembly
Grew mRFP culture
Looked over SS sequencing primers
Tasfia
