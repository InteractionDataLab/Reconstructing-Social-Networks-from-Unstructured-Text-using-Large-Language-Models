Transformation Results:
The gRNA constructs are assembling; Cas9 + YcdO once again failed to assemble.

Miniprep tomorrow for electroporation cotransformation next week
Sam
Prepped questions for Dr. Scheetz
Looked into Australia protocol
Interviewed Dr. Scheetz
Sara
Transformed MIT plasmids
Tasfia
Made sequencing rxn mixtures for (~500 ng) gRNA-mRFP Gibson product based on Paul’s notes from 7.26.16 using the following primers
VR (Biobrick Rev)
Cas9-Seq4 (Fwd)
VF (Biobrick Fwd)
Gibson Reaction for Ycdo into “Cas9-Lrz-SS 1:3” linearized on 8.29.16
New conditions for Gibson:
Ran 5:1 molar ratio of insert-to-backbone, 15 minutes at 50°C in thermal cycler
“Cas9-YcdO”
1.34 µL backbone
0.14 µL insert (Ycdo)
3.52 µL water
5 µL Gibson mix
Negative Control
1.34 µL backbone
3.66 µL water
5 µL Gibson mix
Positive Control
5µL (+) control
5µL master mix
Transformation
1 µL (+) transformation control (CamR)
2 µL Gibson (+) control (AmpR)
2 µL Gibson (-) Control (CamR)
3 µL Gibson Product (CamR)
Worked on presentation for 9.2.16
Attempted to take inventory of Gibson products (check -20°C inventory spreadsheet)
yesterday
back to calendar
tomorrow
