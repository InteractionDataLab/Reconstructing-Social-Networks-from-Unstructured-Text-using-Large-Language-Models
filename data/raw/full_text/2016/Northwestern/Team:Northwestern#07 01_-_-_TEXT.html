Ligation
Meeting with grad students
Results:
Cloning practice: Redid the gel from yesterday. This time, we didn't run the gel quite long enough and the bands didn't separate that much.
Tasks:
Michelle
Website research
Golden Gate preparation
Sara
Ran the gel again
Emailed Bernd
Looked into choosing homologous regions to add onto the signaling sequences, ran into problems with annealing temp
Tasfia
Attempted to make overhangs on SS parts, but the Tm was too high for optimal Gibson assembly with really long overhangs
