Tasks:
Jordan
Gel purified the linearized tet backbone
Mass of gel extract ~300 mg, used 900 uL of GEX buffer
Eluted with water, 30 uL, stood for 5 minutes
Nanodrop readings: 13.6 ng/ul, 260/280: 1.93, 260/230: 0.35
Submitted payment info to Experiment so we should be sent a check soon
Transformed Gibson product
Thawed cells for ~15 mins
5µL of each Gibson product into 50 µL of competent cells
On ice for 30 mins
Heat shocked for exactly 45 seconds
Ice for 5 mins
450 µL of SOC into each

95°C (2:00) | 95°C (0:07),  60°C (0:10),  72°C (1:06) [10 cycles] | 95°C (0:07), 50°C (0:10), 72°C (1:06) [18 cycles] | 72°C (5:00)
25 μL reaction volume, 28 cycles
Ran gel on the Tet RTW-PCR troubleshooting iteration
Gel Extraction of the Linear Tet Backbone
Gel Extracted 1 (lane 4)  and 3 (lane 8)
#1: weight of gel excised: 106.9 mg
#3: weight of gel excised: 163.4 mg
Used Epoch kit & team-modified procedure
Sara
Ran a colony PCR on the GFP and mCherry/storage vectors with Shu
Used Vf and Vr primers, 25 uL total volume, 12.5 uL OneTaq MM. Ran 3 controls: No DNA- the PCR reaction contained everything but template DNA. Positive control- DNA straight from the iGEM kit containing RFP, which is a similar size to our desired inserts (J04450 in pSB1K3), and Backbone- Which was only the pSB1K3 backbone
12.5 uL OneTaq MM
0.5 uL BB Vf Primer
0.5 uL BB Vr Primer
Ran a gel on the colony PCR
The results look like the products are all too small to say that the inserts were successfully placed into the storage vector, but we didn’t run any controls, so we can’t be absolutely positively sure
Helped Tyler transform the Cas9 Gibson product into some cells
Tyler
Ordered gRNA constructs
Designed a lot of the bioinformatics gRNA project
Transformation + Helped sara w/her colony PCR
