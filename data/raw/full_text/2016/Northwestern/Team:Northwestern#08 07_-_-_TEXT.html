Picked colonies on MCherry 1-5 plates from 8/4 and MCherry 1 from 8/5
Because Tet plates were contaminated, used a higher concentration of tetracyline than previous, 20 uL of 5 mg/ml, working concentration 50 ug/ml 2 ml cultures of each
MCherry and GFP storage vector plates had lawns on them, and lawns on the negative control--plates were irregularly poured or antibiotic is bad, could be both
Antibiotic is also from 2011
