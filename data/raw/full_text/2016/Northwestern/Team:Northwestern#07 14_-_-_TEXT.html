We’ve been using Low Melting Point agarose by mistake
Prepared miniprep culture
Sam
Learned even more CSS
Started learning JavaScript
Sara
Miniprepped the pSB1C3-Tet plasmid DNA that Paul grew up the previous night
Ran a miniprep for each tube of culture, one with water and one with elution buffer
89 ng/uL with water elution, 25 ng/uL with elution buffer elution
Made 3 small test containers of 1% agarose
Made a Primers and Parts tab in the lab notebook
Shu
