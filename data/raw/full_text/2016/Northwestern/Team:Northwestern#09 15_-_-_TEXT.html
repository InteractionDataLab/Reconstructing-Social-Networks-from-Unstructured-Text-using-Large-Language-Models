Restriction Digest for Cas9 into pSB1C3 for part submission
Cas9 restriction digest
4 μL Cas9 with added restriction sites (named “Cas9-Res-Dig,” 248.2 ng/μL)
1 μL EcoRI-HF
1 μL SpeI GQ
5 μL 10X Cutsmart buffer
39 μL nuclease-free water
Run for 60 minutes at 37°C, heat inactivated enzymes at 80°C for 20 minutes
pSB1C3 restriction digest
4 μL linearized pSB1C3 (25 ng/μL)
4 μL “Master Mix” as instructed by iGEM protocol
2.5 μL Cutsmart buffer (looking back, should have used NEB Buffer 2)
0.25 μL EcoRI-HF
0.25 μL SpeI GQ
9 μL nuclease-free water
0.25 μL DpnI
Run for 30 minutes at 37°C, heat inactivated enzymes at 80°C for 20 minutes
Ligated Cas9 with pSB1C3 (two reactions to see which protocol works, if any)
iGEM ligation protocol
2 μL pSB1C3 after restriction digest
4.1 μL Cas9 digest (2:1 insert-to-backbone molar ratio)
1 μL T4 ligase buffer
0.5 μL T4 ligase
2.4 μL nuclease-free water
Incubated at 16°C for 30 minutes, heat inactivated at 80°C for 5 minutes
Tyo lab ligation protocol
4 μL pSB1C3 after restriction digest
8.2 μL Cas9 digest (2:1 insert-to-backbone molar ratio)
2 μL T4 ligase buffer
1 μL T4 ligase
4.8 μL nuclease-free water
Incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes, no heat inactivation (immediate transformation)
Transformed ligated products
2 μL iGEM protocol ligated product
2 μL Tyo protocol ligated product
1 μL positive transformation control
Tyler
Picked colonies from GG plates
Talked to Jarod/picked up maxipreps that can be used for minipreps
yesterday
back to calendar
