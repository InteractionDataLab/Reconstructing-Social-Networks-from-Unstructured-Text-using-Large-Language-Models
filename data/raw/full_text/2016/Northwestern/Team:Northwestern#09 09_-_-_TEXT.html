Friday, September 9th
Tasks:
Jordan
Cleaned out the fridge, got rid of Interlab stuff, the base Cas9 plates that we have minipreps and glycerol stocks of, and controls and stuff that never worked anyway
Transformed 3 uL of DsbA Gibson from Gene blocks and from added homology PCRs, negative control with only backbone, and 1ul (50 pg) of competent cell test RFP
30 second heat shock, 950 uL SOC, 1 hr 15 minute incubation, plated 2 plates of each
Paul

Tasfia
PCR: Linearization of Cas9 for signal sequences (again)
50 uL reaction of every SS we have
1 uL template (“Cas9 1:3 136 ng/uL” nanodropped 133 ng/uL)
13 ng (“Cas9-Lrz-SS ‘A’”)
1.3 ng (“Cas9-Lrz-SS ‘B’”)
1 uL fwd 10 uM primer

25 uL OneTaq 2X Master Mix with Standard Buffer
DpnI digested (0.5 μL DpnI per tube) Cas9-Lrz-SS for one hour at 37oC (heat block)
Nanodrop:
Before purification:
Cas9-Lrz-SS “A”: 449.4 ng/uL, 260/280: 1.51, 260/230: 0.66
Cas9-Lrz-SS “B”: 467.9 ng/uL, 260/280: 1.54, 260/230: 0.69
After purification:
Cas9-Lrz-SS “A”: 148.3 ng/uL, 260/280: 1.80, 260/230: 1.32
Cas9-Lrz-SS “B”: 56.0 ng/uL, 260/280: 1.84, 260/230: 1.29
Cas9-Lrz-SS product B was used in today’s Gibson reactions
Made Gibson reaction mixes with DsbA and Cas9-Lrz-SS (5:1 insert-to-backbone molar ratio)
Gibson assembly #1: DsbA insert with PCR-added homology
