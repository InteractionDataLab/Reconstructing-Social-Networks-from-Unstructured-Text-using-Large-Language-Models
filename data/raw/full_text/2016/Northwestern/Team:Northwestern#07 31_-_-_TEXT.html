Reran (7/29) PCR Linearization of the Tet Backbone for Cas9 Gibson +DMSO
4 tubes of the following recipe in order to increase concentration resulting from gel extract:
10 uL water
0.5 uL DMSO (used to increase purity of results)
1.0 uL Tet template (from miniprep)
0.5 uL 10uM fwd primer
0.5 uL 10uM rev primer
12.5 uL OneTaq Master Mix
Total: 25 uL
95°C (2:00) | 95°C (0:07),  60°C (0:10),  72°C (1:06) [10 cycles] | 95°C (0:07), 50°C (0:10), 72°C (1:06) [18 cycles] | 72°C (5:00), 4°C (20:00)
DpnI digest: 1 uL of DpnI added to each of the 4 tubes. Incubated in the 37 for one hour
Ran gel
Loaded 20 uL of each of the 4 tubes of product into each well (we didn’t want to overload), and the other 5 uL into the next 4
All 4 are the same product and look to be about the right size, accounting for the wonkiness of the gel
Gel extracted of the Linearized Tet Backbone- Gibson
Concentration: 41.6 ng/uL
Reran PCR of GFP and mCherry
25 uL OneTaq
1 uL diluted 10 mM f primer
1 uL diluted 10 mM r primer
1 uL GFP/mCherry
21 uL dH20
1 uL DMSO
Ran 2 tubes for each GFP and mCherry at 50 uL volume, per Patrick’s advice
95°C (2:00) | 95°C (0:07), 51°C (0:10), 72°C (0:43) | 72°C (5:00)
DpnI digest
Incubated at 37°C for 2 hours, then overnight
1 uL per 50 uL PCR reaction
