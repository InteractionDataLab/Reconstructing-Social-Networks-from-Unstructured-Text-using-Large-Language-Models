Tuesday, August 30th
Tasks:
Jordan
Started cytosolic GFP cultures for tomorrow
Interviewed Dr. Postelnick
Worked on travel grant
Read instructions for millipore filters
Michelle
Ran western blot
We successfully expressed Cas9
There are no bands in lanes 2-4 because Thush didn’t induce the promoter but Ben offered to run another Western after inducing
It was a good control
Cas9 seems to appear between the 97 and 191 kDa bands, but closer to the 97 kDa band, which is expected (~114 kDa is what we’re going for)
Each of the “Cas9 Assembled” lanes have a lot more bands than expected, and this could be attributed to truncated protein expression and cleavage sites
Kelly can give us cells we can run a western on as a control, to see if the extra bands on lanes 5-7 are attributed to noise
Sam
Interviewed Dr. Postelnick
Emailed Dr. Tullman-Ercek
Cited antibiotics pamphlet for adults
Tasfia
DpnI digest of Cas9-Lrz-SS PCR products from 8.29.16
Golden Gate PCR for sfGFP and mCherry (nine reactions, one 50-uL reaction for each)
sfGFP taken from 8.23.16 miniprep
mCherry taken from 7.35.16 miniprep
Amount of template used:
Conditions: 95°C (5:00) | 95°C (0:07), 54°C (0:10), 72°C (0:43) | 72°C (2:00)
Ran gels on Tet-Lrz-GFP (8.29.16), Cas9-Lrz-SS (8.29.16), and all the GFP/mCherry for GG PCR products (8.30.16)
Used SybrSafe from Jewett lab (bands were very faint on all gels)
Recommended: Use ~3 uL SybrSafe on small 10-well gels (with SybrGreen you can get away with ~1 uL)
These gels used ~3 uL on the 14-well gels
2kB band is very faint
Tyler
Redesigned primers for restriction digestion of Cas9 into PSB1C3
Looked into reusing primers for sequencing of gRNA
Transformation test with Cam plates
Cam and Tet plate test results
Tet plates prepared with Kelly’s LB grew exponentially more colonies than tet plates prepared with our LB on August 8th
gRNA Gibson product grew one colony
Nothing grew on plates prepared with our LB, plates prepared with Kelly’s LB, or Kelly’s already-prepared plates from Leonard lab
There’s probably something wrong with our positive control plasmid for Cam
Drafted e-mail to Tullman-Ercek w/Sam
yesterday
back to calendar
tomorrow
