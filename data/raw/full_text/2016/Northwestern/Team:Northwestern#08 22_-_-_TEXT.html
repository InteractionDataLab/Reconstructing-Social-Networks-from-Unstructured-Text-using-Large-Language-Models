Monday, August 22nd
Tasks:
Jordan
Read vesicle entry paper
Transformed more sfGFP/MCherry minipreps from iGEM parts
Transformed 1 uL of each with 1 ul water as negative control
Heatshocked for 35 seconds
200 uL of SOC
Plated 250 uL Tons of colonies
Looked into Periplasm fractioning tests and ethanol precipitation
Shu
Gel extracted Cas9-Lrz-SS (see gel in Tyler’s notes) Results: Everything had awful 260/230 ratios.
Tasfia
Re-ran PCR for GFP1 for GG, except with extended denaturation time
Two 50-µL reactions with different amounts of template
Template sfGFP concentration, when diluted 1:9 template-to-water, was 2.6 ng/µL
Reaction with 2.6 ng sfGFP
25 µL OneTaq 2X Master Mix
1 µL DMSO
1 µL 10 uM forward primer for GFP
1 µL 10 uM reverse primer for GFP
1 µL sfGFP template
21 µL nuclease-free water
Reaction with 1.3 ng sfGFP
25 µL OneTaq 2X Master Mix
1 µL DMSO
1 µL 10 uM forward primer for GFP
1 µL 10 uM reverse primer for GFP
0.5 µL sfGFP template
21.5 µL nuclease-free water
Conditions:  95°C (5:00) | 95°C (0:07), 54°C (0:10), 72°C (0:43) | 72°C (5:00)
Gel of the GFP1 PCR product
20 µL PCR product in each well
Used purple loading dye and purple 2-log ladder at 1:3 ladder-to-dye ratio
There are still bands at ~400, where they usually occur, but we seem to have some bands near 1000 bp
Our gels consistently end up with products that are not where our ladder predicted them to be. From this we can conclude that the amount of template added to the PCR is not causing the bands to appear smaller than they actually are
Bands have been excised for extraction tomorrow:
stored in -20°C freezer
Put all the 1000-bp bands in two separate tubes
Also excised the ~400-bp bands because I was thinking about extracting that DNA as a gel extraction troubleshooting experiment
Masses are small because of 3D cutting
Masses:
Reaction with 2.6 ng, ~1000 bp: 0.0706g
Reaction with 1.3 ng, ~1000 bp: 0.0862g
Reaction with 2.6 ng, ~400 bp: 0.1295g
Reaction with 1.3 ng, ~400 bp: 0.1486g

Tyler
Ran PCR of Lnrzed Cas9
2 x 50µL reactions:
0.5 µL Template (conc ~ 2.5 ng/µL)/1µL Template
1µL SS FWD (10µM)
1 µL SS REV (10µM)
1µL DMSO
21.5µL water/ 22µL water
25 µL Taq Master Mix
DpnI digest for overnight at room temperature
Ran gel of PCR product Linearized Cas9 for SS at different amounts of template
Read about carbenicillin resistance in E. Coli, new omv uptake paper, looked more into the pathways of antibiotic resistance in pathogens
yesterday
back to calendar
tomorrow
