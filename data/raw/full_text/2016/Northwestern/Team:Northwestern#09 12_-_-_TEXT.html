Followed up on Field museum
Caught up OneNote
To do: Auburn Gresham powerpoint
To do (eventually): redesign survey
Shu
PCR of INP
Ran gel screening
Went over what people have done
Tasfia
PCR: Linearized tet backbone for GFP (same conditions and reaction mix as 08.29.16)
Two 50-uL reactions 45 ng (“Tet-Lrz-GFP A”)
4.5 ng (“Tet-Lrz-GFP B”)
