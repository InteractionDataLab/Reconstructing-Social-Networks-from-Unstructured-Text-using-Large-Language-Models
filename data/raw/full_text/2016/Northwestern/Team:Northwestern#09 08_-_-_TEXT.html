Jordan
Helped with Western blot in the morning
Looked into alternative periplasm fraction options
Transformed Golden Gates and Gibsons
1 uL of Patrick’s transformation control on Amp
1 uL of Gibson YcdO product on Cam
2 uL “   “   “
3 uL “    “   “

Paul
Finished Western Blot procedure with Ben
TetR plasmid expressed less Cas9 than Top10
Fraction procedure may need revision:
Slight Cas9 residue in periplasm fraction
Lanes:
1: ladder
2: Whole cell ClyA-GFP
3: Whole cell Neg control
4: Whole cell Cas9 in pSB1C3 (Tet promoter)
5: periplasm ClyA-GFP
6: periplasm Neg control
7: periplasm Cas9 in pSB1C3 (Tet promoter)
8: ladder
Phosphorylate and anneal gRNA primers:
1 uL PNK
0.61 uL of 100 uM primer 1
0.61 uL of 100 uM primer 2
2 uL T4 ligase buffer
Water to 20 uL
@ 37°C for 30 min @ 95°C for 5 min
Cool to 28 C at ~1°C/min
Sam
Reached out to museums
Put finishing touches on pamphlet
Began writing human practices section for website
Began writing collaboration section for website
Emailed Australia
Sara
Read through the Australians’ protocols and made a list of questions and things that we would need to do them
