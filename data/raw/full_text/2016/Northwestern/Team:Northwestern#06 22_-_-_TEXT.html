Troubleshooting the transformation
Followed the competent cell protocol from the third boot camp with the cells we grew overnight
Placed 5 mL LB and 50 uL of cell culture into each Falcon tube, then placed in the incubator for ~3 hours
After making competent cells, we followed the iGEM transformation protocol using the competent cells made that day, competent cells that Kelly brought us as a control, and control competent cells with kanamycin resistance
With these controls, we should get a better idea of whether the transformation failure was due to the DNA volume typo on the iGEM page, bad chloramphenicol, or badly made competent cells.
Incubated overnight
Sam & Tasfia
FITC dilutions
The Ludox from the iGEM interlab kit was not suspended properly
Absorbance was 1.2 instead of 0.4
Emailed iGEM HQ asking them to resend the Ludox
Michelle
Researched questions that Patrick pointed out, ClyA and LPS toxicity, as well as where in/on the body OMVs can be applied
Worked on the website
Helped with the plate reader
