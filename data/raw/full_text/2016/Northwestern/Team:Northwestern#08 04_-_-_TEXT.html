Thursday, August 4th
Tasks:
Jordan
Transformed the Golden Gate projects:
Left on ice for ten seconds, then all reactions were pipetted into cells within one minute
Added 600 uL SOC (realized I left some tubes off ice for a sec while I was adding media but that hopefully shouldn’t be a problem)
Plated all 650 uL
Transformed GFP/MCherry storage vectors:
Used 600 uL of SOC compared to usual 450
Michelle
GFP Gel extraction
Made more femtomole dilutions
Tet backbone: made 25 μL more
11.84 μL of 27.4 ng/μL stock to 12.5 μL
4.35 μL of 37.3 ng/μL stock to 6.25 μL
4.41 μL of 36.8 ng/μL stock to 6.25 μL
GFP1: made 10 μL more
2.74 μL of 72.2 ng/μL stock to 10 μL
GFP2: made 10 μL more
2.30 μL of 86.0 ng/μL stock to 10 μL
PCR Tet backbone to linearize for GFP in case this golden gate doesn’t work
2 x 50 μL reactions
20 μL nfH2O
1 μL DMSO
2 μL Tet backbone template (from miniprep)
1 μL 10μM forward primer
1 μL 10μM reverse primer
25 μL OneTaq Master Mix
1 negative control (no template)
22 μL nfH2O
1 μL DMSO
1 μL 10μM forward primer
1 μL 10μM reverse primer
25 μL OneTaq Master Mix
Poured a gel to run the Tet linearization for GFP
~20–30 mL of 1% agarose
2 μL SybrGreen
DpnI digested the Tet linearized for GFP PCR product
0.5 μL of DpnI added to each 50 μL PCR tube
Did not digest the negative control tube
Plated ligation products of the Golden Gate parts into storage vectors
Sara
Made cam plates
275 mL LB
4.5 g bacto agar
Autoclave, then 275 uL Cam
Emailed Quentin about getting 6X purple loading dye from the Jewett lab
Shu
Retransform the Gibson products in the freezer
3uL 1:2 product (Shu made)
3uL 1:3 product (Shu made)
3uL product (Jordan made)
1uL positive control from competent cell kit (in J04450- pSB1C3)
1uL positive control from Gibson kit
1uL water
200µL of SOC (as per Kelly’s protocol)
Plated the entire tube
