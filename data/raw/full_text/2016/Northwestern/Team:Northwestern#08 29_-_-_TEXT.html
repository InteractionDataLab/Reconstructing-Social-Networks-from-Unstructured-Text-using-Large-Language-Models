Results:
While GFP and the Gibson kit positive control had colonies, the gRNA Gibson product (Tet) and positive transformation control (Cam) did not yield colonies.
The gRNA Gibson has falied grow the past two times we transformed it, so we’re suspicious that it might not be a problem with the Gibson assembly, because the Gibson control has grown on Amp.

Tasks:
Jordan
Made Cam and Tet plates from the LB Kelly gave us
Two bottles of 250 mL each
Added 3.75 grams of Bacto agar to each bottle and autoclaved, cooled to 55°C in water bath
Added 250 uL of Cam and Tet to respective media
Poured approximately 20 plates of each
Wrapped in foil and placed in the fridge
Michelle
Troubleshot transformation plating
Started running a western blot on TetR-Cas9 and Assembled Cas9 (in triplicate) with Ben from the Jewett lab
Sam
Worked on questions for Dr. Postelnick
To do: set up a meeting (or maybe just email?) Dr. Tullman-Ercek
Ask whether she knows of any good delivery mechanisms to get large proteins to the periplasm
Cas9 size
What pathways we’re already trying
Tasfia
Went to Jewett lab for western blotting TetR-Cas9 and Assembled Cas9
PCR: Linearization of tet backbone for GFP
Three 50-uL reactions
1 uL OneTaq 2X Master Mix
1 uL DMSO
1 uL 10 uM forward primer
1 uL 10 uM reverse primer
1 uL template
Template concentration: 28 ng/uL
Template amounts used:
28 ng
2.8 ng
1.4 ng
Conditions:
Products are DpnI digesting at room temperature overnight
PCR: Linearization of Cas9 for signal sequences
We had to rerun the Cas9-Lrz-SS procedure because the gel extractions from the most recent PCR gave us erroneous concentrations and 260 ratios (~555 ng/uL, really high 260/280 and 260/230 ratios)
25 uL OneTaq 2X Master Mix
1 uL DMSO
1 uL 10 μM forward primer
1 uL 10 uM reverse primer
1 uL template
21 uL nuclease-free water
Two Cas9 template samples used:
“Cas9 1:3” (concentration ~155 ng/uL)
“Cas9 miniprep w/ antibiotic” (concentration ~30 ng/uL)
Four 50-uL reactions with the following template amounts
“Cas9 1:3”
15 ng
1.5 ng
“Cas9 miniprep w/ antibiotic”
3.0 ng
1.5 ng
Conditions:
Product is in the thermal cycler and will be ready to DpnI digest tomorrow morning
Tyler
PCR: Linearization of mRFP
Aided in western blotting
Ordered Gel Kit & SybrSafe
Troubleshot nanodrop
Took some plate pics
yesterday
back to calendar
tomorrow
