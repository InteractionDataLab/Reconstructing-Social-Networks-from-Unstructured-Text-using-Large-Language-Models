Results:
The only transformation that was successful was the positive transformation control from the NEB competent cells box.
Tasks:
Jordan
Loaded linearized Cas9 gel
Ran linearized for SS cas9 backbone gel
Ran gel at 95 V for ~1 hr 20
Transformed Gibson reactions
3 ul of each, 3 ul of 50 pg/ul Competent Cell test RFP, 3 ul nf water
Thawed cells 15 minutes before transformation
On ice for slightly more than 30 minutes
Heat shocked by Sam
Added 200 uL of SOC (maybe slightly less chilled because working near flame?)
Incubated 1 hour 15 minutes
Plated 250 uL
Michelle
Made glycerol stocks of Cas9 grown w/ antibiotic (colony A) and Cas9 grown without antibiotic
500 uL of 50% glycerol
500 uL of cell culture
Miniprepped Cas9 cultures and Tet backbone cultures
Cas9 grown in antibiotic (colonies A, B, C)
Cas9 grown without antibiotic
Tet backbone (colonies A, B, C)

Sam
Nanodrop data
Suspensions of gene blocks were 5 ng/uL instead of 10 and had awful ratios. 3 to 5 = 260/280, -0.4ish = 260/230.
Kelly said to trust the nanodrop and run the Gibson assuming they’re actually 5 ng/uL
Something was 5500 ng/uL. Ratios were good
Solution: dilute with nfH2O
Worked on the phone call script with Jordan
No response from yesterday’s call. Called more numbers.
Performed gel extraction of linearizing Cas9 gel.
Accidentally forgot to let elution water sit for five minutes. Concentration is still fine. 260/230 is 0.8
Sara
Updated the lab notebook and nagged people about writing down the things they’ve done
Checked OD of the cas9 cultures we’re growing up
