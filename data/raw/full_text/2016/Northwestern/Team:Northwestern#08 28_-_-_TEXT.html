Team:Northwestern/08 28
Notebook
Sunday, August 28th
Tasks:
Tasfia
Made 5 mL overnight cultures of "TetR-Cas9," "Assembled Cas9 from Cam Culture," GFP from iGEM kit
Three different colonies
Used 1000X Cam
Working concentration was 35 ug/mL
Added 5.15 uL to each culture tube
Made 5 mL overnight culture of gRNA Gibson product
One colony, duplicate overnight cultures
Used 1000X Tet (10 mg/mL)
Working concentration was 10 ug/mL
Added 5 uL to each culture tube
Gel extracted signal sequences (with homology added)
Used team-modified protocol:
Sat product for ~4 minutes between washes
Evaporated EtOH for ~12 minutes
Eluted in nuclease-free water after standing for ~15 minutes
Going forward: we can attempt a Cas9-SS Gibson after figuring out what’s wrong with the gRNA Gibson assembly
Tyler
Retransformed gRNA Gibson product from 08.26.16
3 µL of gRNA Gibson assembly product
2 µL positive Gibson kit control
2 µL (-) control 1 µL transformation control
Retransformed 1 µL GFP from iGEM kit
