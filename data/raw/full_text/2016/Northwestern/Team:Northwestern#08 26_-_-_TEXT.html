Tasks:
Michelle
Gel extracted gRNA and signal sequences
Used IBI protocol (kit from Leonard Lab)
Nanodrop results: all under 10 ng/uL, 260/280 above 1.9, 260/230 around 0.5 — discarded
Reran signal sequence PCR (to add homology)
1 uL template
1 uL fwd primer 10uM
1 uL rev primer 10uM
1 uL DMSO
21 uL nfH2O
25 uL OneTaq Master Mix
Ran 2 gels on the signal sequence PCR products
Tasfia
DpnI digested Cas9-Lrz-SS PCR product
Made more 10X TAE
Registered all the ChemEs and Jordan for iGEM Jamboree
DpnI digested Tet-Lrz-GFP for two hours and ran a gel screen on it (with 1 uL of our remaining SybrGreen)
Only primer dimers result from the Tet-Lrz-GFP PCR
