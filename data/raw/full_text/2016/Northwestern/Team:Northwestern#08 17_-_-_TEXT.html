Results:
Sequencing:
saCas9 Gibson Assembly was correctly assembled.
Transformation:
The Gibson assemblies of signal sequences into Cas9 were unsuccessful.
Figure 1: Transformation positive control
Figure 2: Transformation negative control
Figure 3: Gibson assembly positive control
Figure 4: No enzyme negative control
Figure 5: gRNA + mRFP Gibson
Figure 6: INP + Cas9 Gibson
Figure 7: TorA + Cas9 Gibson
Tasks:
Jordan
Wrote a lab note for the Experiment page
Reserved room for another outreach discussion
Michelle
Ran gel on Golden Gate reactions
The gel shows the inserts and backbone separately at their respective locations. It does not indicate success. M4 is more dim than expected.
Streaked Delisa cells out on plates
JC8031 on no-antibiotic plate
JC8031-pClyA-GFP-His on Cam plate
