Tasks:
Michelle
Made 50 μL aliquots of nfH2O
Made more femtomole dilutions
Tet backbone: 65.1 ng/μL stock = 50.17 fmol
7.97 μL of stock to 10 μL
mCherry 1: 65.5 ng/μL stock = 132.5 fmol
3.02 μL stock to 10 μL
TorA: 100μM stock
First 1:100 dilution (done to 50 μL)
Second 1:25 dilution (done to 50 μL)
Transformed reactions
Transformed 5 μL of DNA solution to 50 μL of cells for all transformations
Recovered in 200 μL of SOC media
Transformation controls:
NEB cells: mRFP in pSB1C3 (Cam plate)
Our cells:
mRFP in pSB1C3 (Cam plate)
mRFP in pSB1T3 (not plated because we ran out of Tet plates)
Golden Gate reactions:
NEB cells: mCherry 1 + TorA (Cam plate)
Our cells:
mCherry 1 + TorA (Cam plate)
mCherry 1 + TorA without ligase (Cam plate)
Just linearized Tet backbone, no insert (Cam plate)
Gibson reactions:
NEB cells: Gibson for Cas9 (Cam plate)
Our cells:
Gibson for Cas9 (Cam plate)
Gibson kit positive control (Amp plate)
Golden Gate storage vector ligation reaction:
NEB cells: mCherry 1 (Tet plate)
Our cells:
mCherry 1 (not plated because we ran out of Tet plates)
mCherry 2 (Tet plate)
mCherry 3 (Tet plate)
mCherry 4 (Tet plate)
mCherry 5 (Tet plate)
GFP 1 (Tet plate)
GFP 2 (Tet plate)
GFP 3 (Tet plate)
GFP 4 (Tet plate)

2.5 μL Cutsmart 10x buffer (#B7204S exp 6/17)
1 μL XbaI
20.75 μL nf water
1:3 backbone-to-insert product (conc’n: 1102 ng/μL; 260/280: 2.34; 260/230: 1.83)
0.93 μL DNA
2.5 μL Cutsmart 10x buffer
1 μL XbaI
20.57 μL nf water

Ran a gel on digest products, Gibson inserts, and some golden gate products (Thush)
(mCherry1 (tat?), mCherry2 (tat? first row on the GG purple tube holder), mCherry1 control
6X blue loading dye (NEB #B7021S, exp 6/14) was used
Wells 1 and 10: Two ladders ~ 1:3 2-log purple ladder-to-loading dye dilution (8 μL per well)
Well 2: 1:2 backbone-to-insert Gibson product (6 μL)
Well 3: 1:3 backbone-to-insert Gibson product (6 μL)
Well 4: “Cas9” Gibson product (6 μL)
Well 5: Cas9(1) insert (9.6 μL)
Well 6: Cas9(2) insert (10.8 μL)
Well 7: mCherry1 tat (6 μL)
Well 8: mCherry2 tat (6 μL)
Well 9: mCherry1 control (6 μL)
Ran at 95 V for 48 minutes
Gel looked strange; Gibson products appeared nowhere on the gel, even though the NanoDrop picked up good concentrations.
Troubleshooting
We let the gel harden too long
Our ladder is just bad
Cas9(1) and Cas9(2) show up at ~3kb, when they should be at 1.8 and 1.6, respectively
Gibson product has a lot of contaminants (low 260/230 ratios on all three samples)
Diagonal line for “lighter” mCherry bands due to unequal distribution of electric field
GG products were also not linearized
Didn’t NanoDrop that before loading gel either
