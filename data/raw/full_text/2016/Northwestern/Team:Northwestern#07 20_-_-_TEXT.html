Met with Traci from iGEM and UChicago
Sam
Continued compiling list of experts
Met with Prof. Broadbelt
Ran transformation (no controls):
Thawed 100 uL of comp cells
Added 5 uL of Gibson results to the comp cells
15 uL of Gibson left over
Will run a gel with a little of it tomorrow
Mix sat 30 min on ice
45 sec in water bath at 42°C
5 min back on ice
900 uL SOC broth added under flame
Shaking incubator at 37°C for 1 hr
Pipetted 50 uL and 100 uL onto 2 (total) Cam plates and let grow overnight
Plates were a little on the cold side when we plated
Gel:
50 mL recycled gel
5 uL SybrGreen
Did not cover while solidifying. Not used to covering because SyberSafe isn’t as sensitive
Sara
Patrick showed us how to phosphorylate the ends of the primer dimers/make them anneal to each other in prep for Golden Gate
Peter helped us run through the Gibson
Resuspended Cas9(1) and Cas9(2) in 10nL of nuclease free water, bring concentration down to 100 ng/uL
Gibson assembly
Shu
Resuspended Cas9 parts in water with Sara
Used 10 uL of the Gibson master mix
6.25 uL NF water
0.7 uL linearized Tet backbone
1.6 uL Cas9(1)
1.45 uL Cas9(2)
1 hr at 50°C
Total of 20 uL
Learned Golden Gate with Patrick
Gibson assembly with Peter
Golden Gate paper reading
Tasfia
Gibson assembly (see Sara’s entry)
Started transformation (see Sam’s notes about transformation)
