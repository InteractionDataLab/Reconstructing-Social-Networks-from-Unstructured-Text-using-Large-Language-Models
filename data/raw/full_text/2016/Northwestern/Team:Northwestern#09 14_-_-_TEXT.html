All on Cam
Plated 500 uL of 50 uL cells + 950 uL SOC
Incubation= 1 hr 15, heat shock 30 seconds
Sam

Looked over presentation, sent to Emma
Emailed Dr. DeLisa
Edited presentation
Updated OneNote
To do: redesign survey
Sara
Miniprepped Ben’s cell line, pET28a: 23 ng/uL, 260/280: 2.01, 260/230: 2.14
Made a glycerol stock of these cells
Made glycerol stock of Cas9-Dsba (1)
Made glycerol stock of gRNA (4)
Finished transforming the golden gate transformations
Tasfia
PCR Cleanup of INP with homology and Cas9 for restriction digest
Gel screen on Tet-Lrz-GFP from PCR troubleshooting

Tyler
Reviewed sequencing reactions
For Dsba 2,4,7,8,9, A, and B have suboptimal sequencing results, but still look to be usable
USE 1,3,5,6,10
For gRNA, gRNA 6 and 7 had suboptimal results and were thrown away
USE 1,2,3,4,5,8,9,10
