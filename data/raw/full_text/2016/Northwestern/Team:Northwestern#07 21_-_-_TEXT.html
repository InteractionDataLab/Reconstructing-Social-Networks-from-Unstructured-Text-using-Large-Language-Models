Thursday, July 21st
Tasks:
Jordan
Transformed J04550 RFP part to amplify for gRNA construct
Resuspended Kit Plate 4, well 2H in 10 uL of water, transformed 2 uL of that into 50 uL comp cells
Plated 50 and 100 uL
Transformed competent cell test
7 test conditions: 50, 20, 10, 5, and .5 pg/uL of RFP plasmid (part J04550) and 1.11 ng/ul and 8.9 ng/ul of pSB1C3 + tet plasmid
Transformed 1 ul of each
Did two replicate plates of each
Michelle
PCR INP part out of the iGEM registry
10 uL dH2O, pipet up and down, sit 5 min
Transformed INP biobrick
Transformed using 1 uL of diluted DNA from plate
Followed bootcamp protocol except:
50 mL competent cells instead of 100 mL
450 uL SOC instead of 900 uL
Used 108.3 ng/uL DNA straight from the iGEM plate
Plated 100 uL
Ran gel on PCR product
Paul
Planned gRNA assembly procedure
Selected storage plasmids for use in Golden Gate
Transformed mRFP device:
Transformed using 1 uL of diluted DNA from plate
Followed bootcamp protocol except:
50 mL competent cells instead of 100 mL
450 uL SOC instead of 900 uL
Used 108.3 ng/uL DNA straight from the iGEM plate
Plated 100 uL
Sam
Went to the products showcase thing to ask for free stuff
Found more antibiotic experts
Sara
Nanodropped the Gibson Tet Cas9 product - 1730 ng/uL
Diluted the Gibson product to 50 ng/uL
1.16 uL Gibson product
38.84 uL NF water
40 uL in total
Restriction digestion of Gibson
5 uL 10X NE buffer 4
1 uL EcoRi HF
20 uL 50 ng/uL Diluted Gibson (1 ug)
25 uL water
50 uL in total
Ran a gel of the restriction digest with Shu
8 uL ladder
6 uL DNA
2.5 uL restricted DNA (50 ng)
2.5 uL NF water
1 uL loading dye
Shu
Ran a gel of the restriction digest with Sara
Sorting out the things we received from IDT today
Read Golden Gate papers
Looked into the traveling grant
Tasfia
PCRâ€™ed INP and ran a gel for product
2.5 uL 10X PCR buffer
0.5 uL 10 mM dNTPs
0.5 uL INP-fwd at 10 uM
0.5 uL INP-rev at 10 uM
0.5 uL template (BB part, 2.4 kb, so 2 min 24s of elongation)
1 hr at 50oC Total of 20 uL
Transformed INP
Transformed using 1 uL of diluted DNA from plate
Followed bootcamp protocol except:
50 mL competent cells instead of 100 mL
450 uL SOC instead of 900 uL
