Media Recipes
LB Media (for 1L):
10 g tryptone peptone
5 g yeast extract
5 g NaCl
1 mL 1N NaOH or 200 uL 5M NaOH
Add H2O to 1L
Autoclave to sterilize
Store at RT until used
TB Media (for 1L):
12 g tryptone peptone
24 g yeast extract
4 mL glycerol
Add H2O to 1L
Adjust pH to 7.0 with 5M NaOH
Autoclave to sterilize
Store at RT until used
*TB media is used for dense colonies
SOC (for 1L):
20 g tryptone peptone
5 g yeast extract
0.5 g NaCl
47 mg KCl
0.952 g MgCl2
1.203 g MgSO4
3.6 g glucose
Autoclave to sterilize
Store at RT until used
Solutions
10X TAE (for 1L):
900 mL dH2O
48.4 g Tris base
11.4 mL glacial acetic acid
3.72 g EDTA
H2O to 1L
Dilute 1:10 to use 1X TAE
1% agarose:
1 g agarose for every 100 mL of 1X TAE
Microwave until completely clear, boiling
About 3 min, loosen the cap to allow vapor to escape
Pour immediately
Culture plates:
1.5% (w/v) Bacto agar to LB
Autoclave to sterilize
Allow to cool in 50°C water bath until the bottle can be comfortably held
Add 1uL 1000X antibiotic for every mL of agar made
Mix gently to avoid making bubbles
Pour immediately into Petri dishes
Partially cover with lids to set at RT
Cover in aluminum foil, store lid-down at 4°C
