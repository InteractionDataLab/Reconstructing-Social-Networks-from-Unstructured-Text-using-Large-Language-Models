Thursday, August 25th
Tasks:
Jordan
Ran the cell fractions on the plate reader with Michelle
485/520 fluorescence (rows = replicates)
No longer have linearized Cas9 for SS gel extract from 8.19 and 8.22 - lost the DNA in the ethanol precipitation
Ethanol precipitation of 8.19 and 8.22 linearized cas9 for SS gel extract
Added 1/10 the sample volume of 3M sodium acetate (2 uL for each 20 uL sample)
Added 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol (added 50 uL of 95% ethanol (didn’t make a difference)) to each sample
Froze for 1 hr at -80°C
Centrifuge at max speed (14,000 rpm) for 30 minutes
Decant or pipette off supernatant
Air dry pellet for 15 minutes (then 30 in heat block)
Resuspend in water, vortex and spin down
Negative DNA was nanodropped
Lost the DNA
Michelle
Cleared unnecessary items from freezer
Made a 1000X dilution of Cam
0.51 mL of 100 mg/mL stock diluted to 1.5 mL using 200-proof ethanol
Made more Cam plates
200 mL LB + 3.0097 g Bacto Agar (autoclaved)
PCR signal sequences to add more homology
Nanodrop:
FhuD: 13.6 ng/uL
AmiA: 10.9 ng/uL
DsbA: 11.3 ng/uL
YcdO: 18.6 ng/uL
TorA: 6.5 ng/uL
NapA: 10.0 ng/uL
Mix:
0.5 uL of template (SS)
1.0 uL of fwd primer 10 uM
1.0 uL of rev primer 10 uM
1.0 uL of DMSO
21.5 uL of nfH2O
25 uL of OneTaq 2X Master Mix
Conditions:
Cut out gRNA and SS bands and froze them
200 mL LB + 3.0097 g Bacto Agar (autoclaved)
Ran plate reader on periplasm fractions with Jordan
Paul
Tested cell fractioning procedure from Bielfeld iGEM 2014 with Tasfia
2 x 20 mL of DeLisa line
2 x 20 mL of ClyA-GFP in DeLisa line
Tested no SDS and SDS in Cell Frac. Buffer 2
*Final Supernatant contains periplasmic proteins
Cas9 Expression Protocol Plan:
Saturday:
Inoculate 4x 1 mL cultures for overnight growth (add appropriate antibiotic)
Inoculate 2 cultures of saCas9 with our glycerol stocks
Pick 2 colonies from plate in fridge (“TetR, Kelly’s cells) from 8-24-16
Sunday:
Inoculate/grow 5 mL cultures up to OD=0.5
Add 500 uL of grown up cultures to 5 mL LB with antibiotic
Grow to OD=0.5-0.6 (roughly)
Put on ice once at correct OD
Express overnight (~16 hrs) at 37 or 18°CC (1 culture of our cells and one culture of TetR Kelly’s cells at 18, and 1 culture of each cell line at 37)
Use Mordaq’s incubator for 18°C
Monday: Take 5 mL cultures to Ben in Jewett lab in morning (~9 am)
Shu
Ran gel on on Cas9-Lrz-SS:
Excised gel and froze for two hours, then extracted
Concentrations: see 8.29.16
Tasfia
Performed cell fractioning procedure with Paul (see his notes)
Re-ran PCR for Cas9 linearized for signal sequences (to DpnI digest and gel extract next morning)
25 uL OneTaq 2X Master Mix
1 uL DMSO
1 uL 10 uM forward primer
1 uL 10 uM reverse primer
1 uL template
Concentration: 28 ng/uL
Amounts used:
15 ng
1.5 ng
21 uL nuclease-free water
Tyler
