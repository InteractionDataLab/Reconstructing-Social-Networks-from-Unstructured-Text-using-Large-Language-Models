Used Epoch’s kit w/ team procedure modifications:
Washed with WS twice
Let stand for each wash for 1 minute
Let stand before spinning for elution for 5 minutes
Eluted in 20 μL of n.f. water instead of elution buffer
Autoclaved 1 mL tips
Autoclaved 250 mL of LB for Cam plates
0.25 mL of 1000X (35 mg/mL) Cam
1 sleeve poured

Paul
Looked into DsbA as a SS for Cas9
Transformed Gibson product:
50µL competent cells, 5 µL of Gibson product, 1µL of positive control (psb1c3-mrfp), 1µL of negative control (religation of tet backbone)
-waited ~30 minutes
45 second heat shock
450µL of SOC added to each tube
Incubated for an hour
Plated 20 and 200µL plates for each sample
Controls:
Neg: Tet linearized BB+ligase 15 min (used 41 ng/uL BB)
Pos: pSB1C3_J04450 (Transformation Efficiency Test kit: 50 pg/uL)
Looked at gels of Linearized Tet BB for GFP and GFP
Sara
Ran test gel of 08.01.16 GFP PCR:
2 uL of Sybr Green, ~30 mL 1% agarose
5 uL PCR reaction per piece + 1 uL of 6X Blue Loading Dye
6 uL loaded in each well
2 NEB 2 kb ladders run per gel, 2uL of 2kb ladder + 6uL 6X Blue Loading Dye
Dpn1 digest of 08.01.16 GFP PCR with Shu
0.5 uL Dpn1 in each 50 uL tube
Incubated for 2 hours at 37°C
Lab notebook labelling and organizing
Read up on golden gate procedures
Emailed Patrick
Shu
PCR of GFP again with Sara
Ran a final gel and gel extracted the GFPs
Ran a final gel on the digested product, 10uL loading dye in each product, 25uL in each well
Tasfia
Ran gel of 8.1 PCR Tet Backbone Linearization for GFP/mCherry
Gel extraction of Tet Lrz for GFP
Lane 1: 219 mg gel excised, dissolved in 657 μL GEX buffer
Lane 2: 300 mg gel excised, dissolved in 900 μL GEX
Lane 3: 271 mg gel excised, dissolved in 813 μL GEX
Lane 4: 219 mg gel excised, dissolved in 657 μL GEX
Lane 4: 219 mg gel excised, dissolved in 657 μL GEX
Used EPOCH’s iGEM-modified protocol for purification
Let product sit for 1-2 minutes between washes
Washed with WS buffer twice
Let product sit for 5 minutes for more optimal elution
Used nuclease-free water instead of elution buffer
Results: (4 tubes; data has been averaged from four NanoDrop runs per tube)
