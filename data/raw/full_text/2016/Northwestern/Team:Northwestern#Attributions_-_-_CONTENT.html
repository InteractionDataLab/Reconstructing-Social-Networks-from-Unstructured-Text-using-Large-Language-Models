Thank you for recruiting us and kickstarting an accomplished team dynamic that evolved into staunch friendship. </P><P>We would like to thank our phenomenal graduate student TAs for their guidance and dedication to our “bootcamps,” our beginning lab protocol tutorial workshops. Special thanks to <STRONG>Kelly Schwarz</STRONG>, <STRONG>Patrick Donahue</STRONG>, <STRONG>Peter Su</STRONG>, <STRONG>Bradley Biggs</STRONG>, <STRONG>Will Bothfeld</STRONG>, <STRONG>Sara Stainbrook</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Quentin Dudley</STRONG> for walking us through basic lab procedures throughout the spring term before we officially began independent work.</P><P>We met with our faculty advisers on a weekly basis during the spring term to zone in on a project direction. Thank you, <STRONG>Drs. Mike Jewett</STRONG>, <STRONG>Joshua Leonard</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Keith Tyo</STRONG> for your mentorship and willingness to discuss project ideas throughout our long brainstorming process.</P><H1>Lab Support </H1><H2>Technique and Troubleshooting </H2><P>Thank you to all of the graduate students of the Leonard, Tyo, Jewett, and Bagheri labs who jumped on board to talk to us about our project and help us over the summer!</P><P><STRONG>Kelly Schwarz</STRONG> met with us almost every day to talk to us about our project progress, troubleshooting, and handling the MTAs between our university and Cornell and MIT. She made sure we were caught up on deadlines and gave us our first lesson on how to pour culture plates during the iGEM “bootcamps.” She was unbelievably prompt when we asked her questions through email and kindly provided us with encouraging words whenever we found ourselves in a rut. To the best TA we could have asked for, thank you for your infinite knowledge and patience throughout the summer. We couldn’t have done it without you.</P><P><STRONG>Patrick Donahue</STRONG> walked us through running golden gate assemblies, sending DNA off for sequencing, and helped us troubleshoot our transformations by letting us run streak plate tests with him in Dr. Leonard’s lab. During one of our Bootcamp sessions, he taught us how to run a gel and how to run a restriction digest protocol. </P><P><STRONG>Bradley Biggs</STRONG> taught us how to use Genome Compiler to design our constructs and advised us through the weeks-long process of our first designs. He also helped us troubleshoot our Gibson assembly reactions. During our Bootcamps, he walked us through running our first transformation protocol.</P><P><STRONG>Peter Su</STRONG> helped us make calculations for our first Gibson assembly. He, along with Patrick, taught us how to run gels and restriction digest procedures.</P><P><STRONG>Sara Stainbrook</STRONG> ran our first Bootcamp. She walked us through our first PCR reaction and cleanup, gel imaging, and mixing buffers/reagents.</P><P><STRONG>Will Bothfeld</STRONG> helped us run our first transformation protocol during a Bootcamp session. He also developed a cloning log that helped us determine insert-to-backbone ratios for our Gibson assemblies.</P><P><STRONG>Joseph Muldoon</STRONG> sat in on our weekly meetings and discussed troubleshooting and project progress with us.</P><P><STRONG>Quentin Dudley</STRONG> walked us through our first plasmid miniprep procedure and making glycerol stocks during one of our Bootcamps. During this Bootcamp session he showed us the basics of optical density spectrophotometry.</P><P><STRONG>Benjamin Des Soye</STRONG> graciously ran our western blots with supplies from Dr. Jewett’s lab. He walked us through each step and explained how each part of the procedure worked. He also demonstrated the use of an electroporator when it was needed for transformations.</P><P><STRONG>Taylor Dolberg</STRONG> helped us make stocks of chemically competent cells.</P><H2>Materials</H2><P>Thank you to the labs of <STRONG>Drs. Jewett</STRONG>, <STRONG>Leonard</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Tyo</STRONG> for providing us with some reagents to start off our research and to keep us going through late-night experiments, and to <STRONG>Drs. Mordacq</STRONG> and <STRONG>Huaru Yan</STRONG>, who provided us with lab equipment and troubleshooting advice.</P><P><STRONG>Dr. Matthew DeLisa</STRONG> from Cornell University provided us with a hypervesicular strain of <EM>E. coli</EM> (JC8031) and a His-ClyA-GFP plasmid. The hypervesicular strain is sourced (with permission) from the lab of <STRONG>Dr. Roland Lloubes</STRONG> from the Institute of Microbiology of the Mediterranean.</P><P>The lab of <STRONG>Dr. Feng Zhang</STRONG> from the Broad Institute provided us with a plasmid for <EM>S. pyogenes</EM> Cas9.</P><H1>Additional Support</H1><P>Thank you to <STRONG>Dr. Danielle Tullman-Ercek</STRONG>, who advised us on effective periplasm-directing translocation pathways to utilize in our device construction, and to <STRONG>Dr. Michelle Hung</STRONG>, who advised us on working with and purifying vesicles and helped us brainstorm characterization experiments for our project. </P><P><STRONG>Drs. Michael Postelnick</STRONG>, <STRONG>Stephen Persell (MD/MPH)</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Marc Sheetz (PharmD)</STRONG> donated their time to answer our questions about the ethical administration of antibiotics despite high public demand for these drugs for our human practices research. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us.</P><P><STRONG>Building with Biology</STRONG> provided us with a means of educating Evanston youth about biotechnology and its applications. They provided us with a kit of activities and exciting discussions we could share with students participating in summer camps at Northwestern. Using our kit from Building with Biology, we were able to partner up with <STRONG>Northwestern University’s Center for Talent Development (CTD)</STRONG> to have an engaging conversation about gene drives. We also gave them a tour of Dr. Jewett’s lab space, where the students made fluorescent bacteria art on culture plates. <STRONG>Northwestern University’s Society of Women Engineers (SWE)</STRONG> hosted its annual <A href="http://nuswe1.wixsite.com/nu-swe/summer-program">Summer Technology and Engineering Program</A>. We talked about biotechnology to the group of girls participating in the event, and facilitated an activity involving isolating DNA from wheat germ using dish soap and rubbing alcohol. The activity was also inspired part of the kit provided by Building with Biology.</P><P><STRONG>Emma Nechamkin</STRONG> from Teach for America allowed us to teach her high school biotechnology class at <A href="http://pcsedu.org/PMA/home">Perspectives Middle Academy</A> in Auburn Gresham, a neighborhood in the south side of Chicago. Her students had never been exposed to research science, so we were allowed to give them a one-day lecture on CRISPR and antibiotic resistance. Thank you so much for giving us the chance to visit your classroom!</P><P><STRONG>Jessica Yu</STRONG> and <STRONG>Joseph Muldoon</STRONG> helped us troubleshoot our wiki styling problems.</P><P>Thank you <STRONG>Drs. Leonard</STRONG>, <STRONG>Tyo</STRONG> and all of our <STRONG>graduate students</STRONG> for helping us with our presentating skills.</P><H1>Team Roles</H1><P>Our team emphasizes the integration of skills in all aspect of the CRISPR Capsules project. From wet lab work to speaking at public events, each team member has experience in all fields. Though some of us certainly deem ourselves “specialized” in some tasks, we find that the overall contribution from the high-level development of the project to the technical details of lab troubleshooting constitutes efforts from each member of the team. </P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-4"><H3>Wet Lab</H3><UL><LI><STRONG>Paul Perkovich</STRONG></LI><LI>Tasfia Azim</LI><LI>Sara Boyle</LI><LI>Michelle Cai</LI><LI>Sam Davidson</LI><LI>Jordan Harrison</LI><LI>Shu Huang</LI><LI>Tyler Lazar </LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-4"><H3>Construct Design</H3><UL><LI><STRONG>Tyler Lazar</STRONG></LI><LI>Tasfia Azim</LI><LI>Sara Boyle</LI><LI>Michelle Cai</LI><LI>Jordan Harrison</LI><LI>Shu Huang</LI><LI>Paul Perkovich</LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-4"><H3>Lab Notebook</H3><UL><LI><STRONG>Sara Boyle</STRONG></LI><LI>Sam Davidson</LI></UL><H3>Lab Safety</H3><UL><LI><STRONG>Paul Perkovich</STRONG></LI><LI>Michelle Cai</LI></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-4"><H3>Public Outreach</H3><UL><LI><STRONG>Jordan Harrison</STRONG></LI><LI>Tasfia Azim</LI><LI>Sara Boyle</LI><LI>Sam Davidson</LI><LI>Tyler Lazar </LI><LI>Paul Perkovich </LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-4"><H3>Fundraising</H3><UL><LI><STRONG>Jordan Harrison</STRONG></LI><LI>Tasfia Azim</LI><LI>Sara Boyle</LI><LI>Michelle Cai</LI><LI>Sam Davidson </LI><LI>Shu Huang</LI><LI>Tyler Lazar </LI><LI>Paul Perkovich</LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-4"><H3>External Contacts</H3><UL><LI>Sara Boyle</LI><LI>Tyler Lazar</LI><LI>Paul Perkovich</LI></UL><H3>Social Media</H3><UL><LI>Tasfia Azim</LI><LI>Jordan Harrison</LI></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-4"><H3>Wiki</H3><UL><LI><STRONG>Michelle Cai</STRONG></LI><LI>Tasfia Azim</LI><LI>Sam Davidson </LI><LI>Jordan Harrison</LI><LI>Shu Huang</LI><LI>Tyler Lazar </LI><LI>Paul Perkovich</LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-4"><H3>Presentation &amp; Poster</H3><UL><LI>Tasfia Azim </LI><LI>Sara Boyle</LI><LI>Michelle Cai</LI><LI>Sam Davison</LI><LI>Jordan Harrison</LI><LI>Shu Huang </LI><LI>Tyler Lazar</LI><LI>Paul Perkovich</LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-4"><H3>Human Practices</H3><UL><LI><STRONG>Jordan Harrison</STRONG></LI><LI><STRONG>Sam Davidson</STRONG></LI><LI>Tasfia Azim</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><FOOTER id="sponsors"><H1>Thank you to our sponsors!</H1></FOOTER><FOOTER id="nav_foot"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-4"><DIV><P><STRONG>Northwestern University</STRONG>
