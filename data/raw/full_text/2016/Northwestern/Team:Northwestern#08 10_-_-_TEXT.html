Cam Plate Test
All concentrations of Cam showed colonies. The 12.5 ug/mL plates showed more colonies, which is to be expected because it was the lowest concentration of antibiotic used. We used the high copy number cells from streak of Patrick’s cells on 08.09.16.

Cas9 Sequencing
Looks like “old” Cas9 1:3 worked and is assembled. Will now transform miniprepped probably ok DNA and plate on different antibiotic concentration.
Tasks:
Jordan
Gave check to ChemE office
Transformed assembled Cas9 miniprepped plasmids into cells
Transformed 1 uL (130 ng) of Cas9 miniprepped on 8/9 from culture with chloramphenicol, 1 ul (240 ng) of Cas9 miniprepped on 8/7 from no antibiotic culture
Controls:
positive—J04500 in SB1C3 (RFP), 20 pg in 1 uL
negative—1 ul nuclease free water from freezer aliquot
Conditions:
Competent cells were retrieved from -80 about 15 minutes before use
On ice for 30 minutes
Transformed for 45 seconds- 42 degrees confirmed on thermometer
On ice for 5 minutes
200 uL of SOC added from Patrick’s aliquot- topped flamed before use
Incubated 1 hour
Plated 250 uL of each
Paul
Got sequencing results back
Talked with Kelly, Patrick about our cells’ transformation efficiency
Sam
Made UNSW meeting doc & worked on content
Researched JC8031 to make sure we know why it works
Worked with Jordan to get funds settled from Eligo
Shu
Dpn1 Digest of linearized mRFP backbone—0.5 µL per 50 µL reaction
Ran two gels
Tyler
Ran gel of mRFP Linearization before and after miniprep
m1 and m2 were prepared from 2 different colonies. The negative control had DNA, and 200 ng of backbone was used in this reaction. This gel was thrown out.
This was a test to see whether the miniprep was contaminated. It was not.
E-mailed Jarod about plates/tips
Ordered another sequencing primer to better sequence our Cas9 part
yesterday
back to calendar
tomorrow
