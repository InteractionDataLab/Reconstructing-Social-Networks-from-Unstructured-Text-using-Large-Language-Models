Michelle
Ran gel on Cas9 linearized for signal sequences
Gel extracted the upper crest
Pt 1: 0.2561 g (dissolved in 0.85 mL GEX)
Pt 2: 0.3051 g (dissolved in 1.00 mL GEX)
Nanodrop: 31.4 ng/uL, 260/280: 1.68, 260/230: 1.17
PCR for GFP 1 to test template DNA amounts
Made a 1:10 dilution of the 42.5 ng/uL miniprepped stock of template
Reactions:
1.0 uL of template reaction
1 uL of 4.25 ng/uL GFP template
1 uL of 10 uM forward primer
1 uL of 10 uM reverse primer
1 uL of DMSO
21 uL of nfH2O
25 uL of 2X OneTaq Master Mix
0.5 uL of template reaction
0.5 uL of 4.25 ng/uL GFP template
1 uL of 10 uM forward primer
1 uL of 10 uM reverse primer
1 uL of DMSO
21.5 uL of nfH2O
25 uL of 2X OneTaq Master Mix
Conditions: 95°C (5:00) | 95°C (0:07), 54°C (0:10), 72°C (0:43) | 72°C (5:00)
Ran gel of GFP test PCR
Used NEB Purple Loading Dye 6X
2 uL 2 log purple ladder + 6 uL dye
50 uL PCR reaction + 10 uL dye
15 uL of reaction into each well
Results were the same as previous PCRs, did not extract
Paul
Did the presentation
Looked over Cas9 BB insert primers
Looked at GFP primers
Sam
Troubleshot GFP PCR. It’s making 500 bp bands instead of 800, so I tried to find other binding sites for the primers. Couldn’t find anything
Started work on Resisting Resistance public kit
Tasfia
Re-ran PCR/gel for GFP/mCherry for GG, but only for GFP
Running with an annealing temperature of 54°C instead of 51°C (which is what we were doing before)
NEB recommends an annealing temperature of 53°C, but we ran at 54°C as per Bradley’s suggestion at this morning’s meeting
PCR protocol is otherwise exactly the same as the one used the day before (18 August 2016)
Ran a gel of GFPs
Out of 60 μL PCR product + dye per tube, put 20 μL in each well
Did not extract
Made progress on “Attributions” web content
