Tuesday, June 21st
Agenda:
Grow up DH5Î±
Review S. aureus Cas9 sequence
Results:
All cells save 2 lines from the previous day did not grow. The most likely reason for the transformation failure is a typo on the iGEM website. The procedure said to resuspend the DNA in 100 uL of water, but the instructions most likely meant 10 uL. We believe the excess DNA over-stressed the competent cells.
Tasks:
Shu & Sara
Grew 5 more 5 mL LB + DH5a E. coli tubes
Incubated overnight
Michelle
