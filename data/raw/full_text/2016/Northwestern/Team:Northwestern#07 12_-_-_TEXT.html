Team:Northwestern/07 12
Notebook
Tuesday, July 12th
Agenda:
Transform pSB1C3 & miniprep
PCR cleanup/Gel
Tasks:
Jordan
Talked about ethics with CTD kids
PCR cleanup: used nuclease-free water instead of elution buffer, final conc. ~55 ng/uL
Added lab notes to Experiment
Michelle
Made 1L of 1X TAE buffer:
100 mL 10X TAE
Filled to 1L dH2O
Made 100mL of 1% agarose:
1 g agarose
100 mL of 1X TAE
Gel prep
3 uL SybrGreen
Allowed the gel to cool for a long time (~1.5 hours)
Used 5 uL of PCR product from linearizing the backbone and 1 uL purple loading dye
The agarose was still unusually soft
Website research
Paul
Outreach: Genedrive presentation
Transformed pSB1C3+Tet
PCR cleanup of linearized Tet backbone for Cas9 insertions
Sam
Did the outreach + made the outreach doc
Researched S. aureus gRNA
Responded to Rose
Refined CSS talents
Sara
Outreach at Roycemore
Emailed Bernd asking for empty backbones for saCas9 and spCas9
Shu
Updated our logo + graphics design research
Tasfia
Wrote/started lab notes on Experiment
Read up on mechanism of CRISPR/Cas9
Started a spreadsheet for iGEM parts we’re using
Tyler
Gel prep
Read up on saCas9 on protein structure/sgRNA design
Began designing gRNA gblock
Results:
Paul’s Tet-plasmid linearization worked, the others did not
yesterday
back to calendar
