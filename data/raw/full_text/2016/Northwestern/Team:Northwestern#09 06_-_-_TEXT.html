Jordan
Figure 1: Troubleshooting summary
Ran periplasm fraction protocol on Cas9 culture in TetR
Centrifuged 25 mL suspension for 20 minutes at 4000 rpm and 4C
Discarded supernatant
Resuspended in 6.25 mL of ice-cold sucrose cell fractioning buffer 1
Incubated for 20 minutes, shook periodically
Centrifuged for 30 minutes at 4000 rpm and 4 degrees
Discarded supernatant
Resuspended in 1.56 mL ice cold buffer 2 with no detergents, transferred to eppendorf tube
Incubated for 20 minutes on ice
Centrifuged for 15 minutes at 11000 rpm on tabletop centrifuge
Saved supernatant, in fridge
Michelle
Gel extracted Cas9 for SS and Cas9 for iGEM
Nanodrop results:
Cas9 lnrz for SS: 9.0 ng/uL, 260/280: 1.8, 260/230: 0.44
Cas9 res.dig. for iGEM: 8.8 ng/uL, 260/280: 1.85, 260/230: 0.43
Paul
Got sequencing back for gRNA assembled construct
Results aligned under “Assembled Parts>pSB1T3…+gRNA”
Few point mutations on mRFP and Terminator-likely not too bad
Gibson assembly of YcdO (10 uL: *6:1 insert:bb, 1% DMSO, 4 hrs @50 C*)
4.4 uL of Cas9 lnrz for SS (from 9/1/16 PCR, gel extracted 9/6/16- 9 ng/uL)
0.5 uL of YcdO (from PCR products, 38 ng/uL)
0.1 uL DMSO
5 uL Gibson Assembly HiFi MasterMix
Met w/ Joe (w/ Tyler) about modeling
Detect potential off target cleavage sites of our gRNA in the gut microbiome
Restriction digest linear pSB1C3 and linear Cas9 (EcoRI, SpeI)
Sam
Sent Emma Nechamkin emails
Grew up two cultures (25 mL to start, ~22 mL now exist)
Both JC8031
One has pClyA-GFP-His6 Cam
Induced with 290 uL arabinose at about .5 absorbance (actual absorbance labelled)
One is normal
No antibiotic
Overnight in the 37°C shaking incubator
Found and watched antibiotics and CRISPR videos
Started adding graphics to pamphlet
Tyler
Mathematical modeling meeting w/Joe
Transformation of ligated products + Gibson SS (Ycdo)
3µL Ligated Cas9 Product
5µL Gibson SS Product
1µL Transformation control (50pg mRFP control)
2µL Gibson (+) control
