PROJECT
For better environment
Description
This year we successfully improved the function and characteristic of a previously existing part called OmpA (BBa_J36836) by extending its applications to the cell surface display system in E.coli.

Design
To address the principles of our photosynthetic system and silicon encapsulation system, we made some demonstrations and flow charts to explain the background knowledge including CdS-mediated electron transduction, PbrR-based artificial photosynthetic machinery and aerobic hydrogen production factory.

Modeling
Modeling plays an increasingly vital role in the research of synthetic biology. Then, what is modeling? Modeling aims to build and use a model which provides a theoretical explanation for a phenomenon in simpler fashion than real situation. The procedure of modeling consists of observing a phenomenon, identifying influential parameters and filtering decisive ones. According to the results of modeling, you may predict what would happen under different conditions.
