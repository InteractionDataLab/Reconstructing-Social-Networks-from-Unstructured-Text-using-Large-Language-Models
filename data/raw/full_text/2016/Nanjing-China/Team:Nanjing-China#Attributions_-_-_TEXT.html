Overview
We are so lucky this year to have a wonderful leader and a group of talented students, without whom our project won’t go that smoothly. We also have support from school of life sciences for funding, from host labs for facilities and lab reagents, from instructors and advisors for close supervision and mentoring, from many experts in hydrogen production field for precious advice and from other iGEM teams for suggestions!
Funding Support
We are lucky to have funding from school of life sciences of Nanjing University, which makes it possible for us to participate in this wonderful competition, to do experiments and to go to Boston for the Giant Jamboree!
Host Lab
Our project is all done in Prof. Jing Zhao’s lab. We owe great thanks to all people from Zhao group who not only provided us with facilities, lab materials and reagents generously, but also detailed instructions and supervisions.
Advisor
Our advisor Peiqing Sun is mainly responsible for supervision and mentoring. He is a senior researcher in Zhao group and carefully guides us to do experiments. He is also a wonderful mentor who helps us a lot indeed. We become good friend with him thanks to this competition!
Instructor
Prof. Jing Zhao and Dr. Wei Wei are two instructors for our project and are responsible for mentoring and supervision. They generously provided space for us to do experiments and helped us to settle down ideas of our project. We report progress of our project to them regularly and they can always give us important suggestions about the project and direct us to the right way!
Team Members
This year, our team Nanjing-China is very lucky to have a group of lovely and smart students! We did all the lab work all by ourselves and experienced ups and downs during this process. Luckily, we got wonderful results in the end, which makes the efforts we’ve paid indeed worthwhile. We also have experts in modelling who have strong background knowledge in mathematics and programming. We have talented people in arts and design, who helps to design our logo, make beautiful pictures on the wiki and make the final posters. Besides, we did the wiki all by ourselves because we have smart students who can do wonderful programming and have solid skills in academic writing. The detailed attribution is listed as follows.
