Biosafety
Biosafety is the prevention of large-scale loss of biological integrity, focusing both on ecology and human health. These prevention mechanisms include conduction of regular reviews of the biosafety in laboratory settings, as well as strict guidelines to follow. Biosafety is used to protect us from harmful incidents. High security facilities are necessary when working with Synthetic Biology as there are possibilities of bioterrorism acts or release of harmful chemicals and or organisms into the environment. A complete understanding of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology is helping to enforce the knowledge and effectiveness of biosafety.

Basic Parts
This year, we have successfully submitted seven basic parts into the part registry. We not only sequenced and characterized the parts, but proved their functions as well. We also assembled them into functional BioBrick devices and proved their functions.

Engagement
This year our team is focused on artificially utilizing solar energy to drive downstream reactions such as hydrogen production. We think it is very important to gain support from the public when it comes to new energy applications. Therefore, we investigated public opinions about current energy issues to know their understandings and requirements of new energy at first. We then propagated characteristics of new energy and principles of our project to social communities. Besides, to promote education, we also opened our lab to primary school students, taught them knowledge about synthetic biology and guided them to do experiments. We received positive feedbacks after these public engagement activities and found that most people were passionate about new energy development, which indeed encourages us a lot!
