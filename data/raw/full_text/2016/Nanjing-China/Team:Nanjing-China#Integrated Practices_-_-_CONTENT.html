When it comes to new energy development, there are mainly three aspects that should be considered in our humble opinion, efficiency, technology and cost.  </H6><P> </P><H6>Efficiency mains that the development of this kind of new energy is worthwhile and bears advantages over traditional chemical energy. Thus we counselled experts in hydrogen production fields about current bottlenecks in hydrogen production. </H6><P> </P><H6>Technology mains the techniques and principles used in hydrogen production that facilitate its utilization in industry. We interviewed chemists and biologists about details of the engineered bacteria, such as how electrons can be conducted across the plasma membrane. </H6><P> </P><H6>Cost mains not only the expenses used in the development of hydrogen, but the time input as well. We must gain support from the public and government in order to afford the cost of new energy development. Therefore, we designed questionnaires at first to investigate the public opinion about hydrogen energy. We also propagated the advantage of hydrogen as new energy as well as our projects to the communities. We even opened up our lab to primary school students to attract more attention to synthetic biology as well as to promote education.</H6><P> </P><H6>Besides these efforts, we also attended many conferences to not only keep in touch with iGEMers, but promoting our projects as well. These young scientists can always come up with interesting ideas! In addition, we also spare no efforts to help iGEM teams in China and even help two universities to establish new teams, which is very meaningful and exciting!</H6></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="description" id="b"><DIV class="container_1"><DIV class="container_1_title"><H3 style="padding-bottom:20px; padding-top:20px;"><STRONG>Questionnaire</STRONG></H3></DIV><DIV class="container_1_content"><H6>We designed a questionnaire about general energy issues and our project both in English and Chinese versions. Finally, we have collected 573 samples, which qualified us to make further analysis about our topic.</H6><P> </P><P id="b1"> </P><H3>1. Respondents</H3><P> </P><H6>In order to get a comprehensive knowledge of people’s understanding about the background of our project, we collected a variety of respondents of different ages, different occupations and different knowledge levels. As to the age, respondents of 18-29 years old, such as university students, account for more than one-third of the total, so as the respondents of 30-49 years old, who are energetic to do their jobs or researches. The rest are people under 18 or above 50. Besides, as to the knowledge level, most respondents have received well-round education. And also, not so many, but also not none people with professional knowledge are involve according to the Job type results. That is to say, we almost covered ever stage of people and we are going to get a really comprehension results</H6><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><H3 id="b2">2. The knowledge of new energy</H3><P> </P><H6>Most people think that fossil fuels are running out and exploration of new energy has a big impact on future. However, people are overconfident about the time left. More than half the people think that energy crisis is 200 years away from now, which is not the case at all. This results dictates that propagation of basic knowledge about chemical energy and new energy such as solar energy is necessary. Solar energy is also the most well-known energy among the people surveyed.</H6><P> </P><P> </P><H6>Besides, we also investigated the attitudes of the public about the applicability of new energy. It turns out that cost and damage to the environment are the most important considerations of new energy development from the points of the public. We also found that community activity and propagation on the internet are the most acceptable ways for new energy propagation.</H6><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><H3 id="b3">3. The knowledge of Bio-hydrogen</H3><P> </P><H6>We are also curious about the public opinion of bio-hydrogen production. It turns out that the public don’t know well about the advantages of hydrogen as a new energy. Most people regard hydrogen as an unsafe form of energy and think it difficult for application to the industry, which is also the main problem that scientists want to solve.</H6><P> </P><P> </P><H6>For hydrogen production methods, water electrolysis is the most widely known. However, the public expect photo-biological water splitting as the most promising way, which is exactly what our project is focused on.</H6><P> </P><P> </P><H6>To get more specific opinions about our project, we also asked some detailed questions. To our surprise, most people have heard of microbes for energy production ad regard them as organisms with short life cycle and low energy consumption. Most of them can accept genetic modified organisms in hydrogen production, which makes it easier for propagation of our project.</H6><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><H3 id="b4">4. The propagation of iGEM</H3><P> </P><H6>In the last part of our questionnaire, we also designed some questions to propagate iGEM. The data shows that around 50% of respondents have heard of iGEM, and they mostly heard from educational or scientific research institutions. Besides, they treasure it as an opportunity to communicate other than competing as the meaning of this competition. It indicates that although iGEM is well-known to universities and scientific research institutes, it still lacks online propagation and social communities. Thus we made up plans to propagate iGEM through social activities in the community and propagations online. </H6><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="description" id="c"><DIV class="container_1"><DIV class="container_1_title"><H3 style="padding-bottom:20px; padding-top:20px;"><STRONG>Education</STRONG></H3></DIV><DIV class="container_1_content_2"><H6>To propagate basic ideas of synthetic biology and iGEM and promote education, we opened up our lab to children from Nanjing Foreign Language Primary School on June 1<SUP>st</SUP>, which is the National Children’s Day. Eight third-year children came to our lab with great enthusiasm about science.</H6><P> </P><H6>One of our team members, Zhen Li gave a training to the kids about the biosafety issues in the lab. He took the kids to wash their hands and wear gloves before they went into the lab. These children were very curious about the various facilities, reagents and materials in the lab and observed them very carefully. We showed some simple experiments to the kids at first, namely, the reaction between iodine and starch. The kids were very surprised that the color turned blue when iodine and starch were mixed together. We also gave the children some 10ml tubes and taught them how to use the pipette. Under our supervision, they added 1ml of NaCl to 1ml of AgNO<SUB>3</SUB> and were excited about the “magic power” of the white precipitation in the tube. One girl even said that she felt as if she was a fairy. Besides, we also showed the kids the <EM>E.coli</EM> that we cultured and taught them how to use model organism to test our hypothesis. We told these passionate young scientist that science is a journey of ups and downs and the up moments really make the down moments worthwhile!</H6><P> </P><H6>Considering the safety issues, we took the tubes and materials back from the children, although they seem to be fascinated about these magic “toys”. Captain Chen Chen sent the kids cards and T-shirts to them when they left our lab. The kids said that it was the first time that they get to know synthetic biology and it was very interesting. This activity is indeed a good propagation of both iGEM and synthetic biology!</H6><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="description" id="d"><DIV class="container_1"><DIV class="container_1_title"><H3 style="padding-bottom:20px; padding-top:20px;"><STRONG>Community Propagation</STRONG></H3></DIV><DIV class="container_1_content_3"><H6>The development of new energy is always expensive and takes a long period of time, making it difficult for the public to know and support. Therefore, our team planned to attract public attention to new energy development by community propagations. We went to an activity center in a neighborhood in Henan Province and promoted knowledge about new energy development to the citizens there. We also propagated our project to them in a simple and easy-to-understand way. Besides, we appealed people to choose green energy and ultimately we got 256 signatures from people who realized how important it is to choose hydrogen for a better future.</H6><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="description"><DIV class="container_1"><DIV class="container_1_title"><H3 style="padding-bottom:20px; padding-top:20px;"><STRONG>Counselling</STRONG></H3></DIV><DIV class="container_1_content_2"><P> </P><H3>1. Christopher Chang</H3><P> </P><H6>In May, we were very lucky to meet with Christopher Chang from UC-Berkeley and discussed our project with him. He showed us amazing ways to mimic hydrogenase using chemical methods and gave us important suggestions about the background knowledge. After the discussion, we took him to tour around the campus.</H6><P> </P><P> </P><H3>2. Xinghua Xia</H3><P> </P><H6>On the afternoon of July 19th, we interviewed with Prof. Zou from state key laboratory of biochemistry in NJU who is an expert in hydrogen production. He introduced to us new methods for hydrogen production such as biomimetic catalysts for hydrogen production. We also got inspired about some chemistry problems in our project. First, the function of S<SUP>2-</SUP> in CdS is to change the energy state of Cd. The S<SUP>2-</SUP> that we added in our experiment is different from Cys. Thus we should add the control experiment: no S in the solution, add S<SUP>2-</SUP>, add Cys. He also advised us to test the size of bandgap for utilization of visible light. Second, he suggested that we should consider the interactions between S<SUP>2-</SUP> and protein PbrR. Third, there are two ways for transmembrane electron transduction. Last but not least, we should consider the choice and optimization of reductants. The interview with him was indeed inspiring because Prof. Zou showed us a broader way to think about problems.

Zhigang Zou</H3><P> </P><H6>On September 15th, we are honored to interview Mr.Zou (Zhigang Zou) from Nanjing University. Professor Zhigang Zou is a famous Academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences, researching into photocatalytic material. As a physicist and material scientist, he applied the technology of crystallography to catalyzing the hydrogen production by water electrolysis, and this work was published on Nature in 2001 and simultaneously commented by Science to mark its profound significance.</H6><P> </P><H6>The biggest question Professors proposed is the reason why we choose <EM>E.coli</EM> instead of photosynthetic organisms such as algae. Next, Professor Zou’s laboratory has cast light on bio-hydrogen, as Xiong Wei from Zhejiang University would also join the lab after graduation. He planned to perform experiments on hydrogen produced by algae thus Professor Zou would love to establish cooperation with us. Professor Zou suggests that they can propose new thoughts and ideas about our iGEM project and bio-produced hydrogen from subjects of physics and materials.
At last we owe our great thanks to Professor Zou Zhigang, Professor Yao Yingfang and Professor Yu Zhentao for their participation and support.
</H6><P> </P><H6>In conclusion, we did learn a lot from the interview. Firstly, we obtained more knowledge about the background of producing hydrogen, and thus, we have a much clearer concept of the current hydrogen-producing situation in China. Secondly, we knew more detailed advantages and disadvantages about hydrogen production catalyzed by nanomaterials. No doubt we received precious encouragements for our project.

CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee)</H3><P> </P><H6>On 2nd-4th September, our team was invited by Sun Yat-sen University to attend CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee). The summit was a rehearsal of the Giant Jamboree in September. All the 26 teams invited to the summit were asked to give presentations about their project. The audience can ask questions about them. Besides, previous captains of Peking-iGEM were also invited to give speeches about the development of synthetic biology in China. We also brought our posters with us and discussed our projects with teams all around China. </H6><P> </P><H6>During CCiC, our posters and presentations were very popular among all of the teams. Some of the iGEM teams that had great interests in our project came up with lots of suggestions and advice, which were of great help to improve our project. We owe great thanks to Mr. Haoqian Zhang, who gave us important suggestions about how to present our project in a logical order. He said that our photosynthetic system could be applied to other model organisms as long as we change the cell surface display protein, which is very inspiring.</H6><P> </P><H6>The precious experience not only enlightened us about the design of our experiment, but also provided us with new ideas about synthetic biology. The presenters in our team also got more familiar with the presentation. </H6><P> </P><P> </P><H3>2. Conferences in Huazhong University of Science and Technology</H3><P> </P><H6>On July 6th, we collected very precious suggestions from the conference in Huazhong University of Science and Technology. First, team Shanghai Tech A is also doing experiments about constructing a photosynthetic system with CdS, but they are using a special species called <EM>Moorella Thermoacetica</EM>. There are current seven kinds of bacteria that can transmit electrons. Secondly, a team from Taiwan last year has focused on the protein OmpA, but with low efficiency. We don’t meet this difficulty this year fortunately. Third, a teacher from Taiwan was curious about how to transform such a long gene HyaABCDEF into <EM>E.coli.</EM> Last, A teacher from Taiwan suggested that the experiments should be done under well-controlled conditions. There are possibilities of false positive and false negative results because of the low concentration of hydrogen. The teacher also suggested that we can either change the contents of the media to reduce loss of hydrogen or add a negative pressure to suck out all the hydrogen.</H6><P> </P><P> </P><H3>3. Conferences with five iGEM teams in Zhejiang University</H3><P> </P><H6>In summer, we got the chance to communicate our projects with other five iGEM teams from Zhejiang University, Tsinghua University, Sun Yet-Sen University and Fudan University. Students from other universities are very interested about our project and come up with many doubts and suggestions. One student from ZJU is interested about the formation of CdS precipitation. He also had his explanations about why red fluorescence intensity becomes darker upon silicon encapsulation. Another student from ZJU suggested that if electrons can’t be conducted across the cell membrane of E.coli, we can try to culture <EM>shewanella spp</EM>. with E.coli to increase electron transduction efficiency because the flagella of <EM>shewanella spp</EM>. can help to aggregate <EM>E.coli</EM>. </H6><P> </P><H6>This conference indeed helped us familiarize with our project as well as deepen the friendship between different teams in China. </H6></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="description"><DIV class="container_1"><DIV class="container_1_title"><H3 style="padding-bottom:20px; padding-top:20px;"><STRONG>Brochures</STRONG></H3></DIV><DIV class="container_1_content"><H6>To propagate iGEM and make our human practice easier, we also made a beautiful brochure which contains detailed explanations of the iGEM competition.

The iGEMers are a group of young people who have passion about synthetic biology and are representatives of the synthetic biology community. Our close collaborations with each other not only helps us know many friends, but assists in propagating our ideas and projects to the science community all over China. </H6></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="description"><DIV class="container_1"><DIV class="container_1_title"><H3 style="padding-bottom:20px; padding-top:20px;"><STRONG>Collaborations with other iGEM teams</STRONG></H3></DIV><DIV class="container_1_content_2"><P> </P><H3>1. Team Tianjin</H3><P> </P><H6>At the beginning of the summer vocation, team Tianjin contacted us for help and support. They wanted a kind of bacteria called <EM>Rhodococcus jostii RHA1</EM>. We eagerly contacted Prof. Aijun Liao in our university asking for this species, cultivating it and then mailed <EM>Rhodococcus jostii RHA1</EM> timely. After that, when they encountered some difficulties cultivating this species, we assisted them to get technical support about the conditions for culturing this kind of bacteria.</H6><P> </P><H6>Later, in CCiC conference, we are pleased to know that team Tianjin managed to use <EM>Rhodococcus jostii RHA1</EM> successfully and achieved crucial experiment results based on this species. Therefore, we took a picture with each other’s posters together to witness this collaborations. Besides, some of the team members in team Tianjin or team Nanjing-China made great friends and team Tianjin gave special gifts to us during CCiC to express their thanks.</H6><P> </P><P> </P><H3>2. Team NEFU-China</H3><P> </P><H6>We got in touch with NEFU-CHINA during the CCiC conference by asking questions after their presentations. Most of our team members were really interested in their project so we meet them after the Q&amp;A time of the presentation. In this meeting, our team members came up with some great ideas to improve their project. What’s more, when advisors in team NEFU-China put forward their difficulties of proceeding experiments, we offered to share some equipment with them and invited them to our lab. All of the teachers and students in team NEFU-China are excited about this invitation and expressed intense interests in collaboration. Therefore, about one month later, they invited us to their lab for a visit. Team members of our team gave presentations in their lab and both of the teams had a great team communication about iGEM and experiments. However, because of the long distance and the big expenses, they cancelled the plan to come to our lab proceed experiments. Nevertheless, we are communicating through emails and we have supported them with experiment materials as well as suggestions on their experimental design. </H6><P> </P><P> </P><H3>3. Team UCAS</H3><P> </P><H6>We formed collaborations with team UCAS during CCiC’s poster time. We are impressed about their hard work and great courage because they are the youngest team and the oldest students of their school (UCAS has been established three years ago). During the conversation between two teams, they put forward their future plan to use a kind of reusable materials to adhere bacteria, which is exactly the same as we tried last year. The adviser of our team realized immediately that they might have chosen the wrong reusable material. Therefore, we gave them suggestions about choices of reusable materials. Students of their team were grateful hearing this useful suggestion. Moreover, we also provided them with materials shown in the picture, which is used for bacteria aggregation in solution. No doubt that we saved them a lot of time choosing the reusable material and building the right equipment.</H6></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="description"><DIV class="container_1"><DIV class="container_1_title"><H3 style="padding-bottom:20px; padding-top:20px;"><STRONG>Establishment of New iGEM Teams</STRONG></H3></DIV><DIV class="container_1_content_3"><P> </P><H3>1. Southeast University</H3><P> </P><H6>Students from Southeast University are interested to use DNA to manipulate gate control circuit. However, they are not familiar with characteristics of DNA. They are also unaware of iGEM. They came to us for suggestions about how to use DNA to manipulate gate control circuits and expressed their interests in participating iGEM in 2017. Thus we assigned one of our team members, Zhen Li to help them with their project design as well as give them information about the iGEM competition. From then on, we formed intimate collaboration relationship with them and discussed with them every week to track their progress. We even specially designed a brochure containing detailed explanation of iGEM competition to them. (<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2016/e/e7/T--Nanjing-China--iGEM_propagation_brochure.pdf">Click here to get the PDF file.</A>) The collaboration goes smoothly and they have already formed ideas about the project in next year’s competition. They will establish a new iGEM team next year with our help! </H6><P> </P><P> </P><H3>2. TMMU-China</H3><P> </P><H6>This year we also cooperated with team TMMU-China, which is a team participating in iGEM for the first time. For starters, we offered timely help to them around May on how to establish a team by sending basic plasmids and answering questions through social media. After many rounds of discussions, we invited them to Nanjing University to have a face-to-face communication about each other’s project on June 9th. In return for this little conference, on September 24th, some of our team members and our team leader joined the meeting up with TMMU-China along with a few other teams. It is indeed a wonderful collaboration experience and both of us benefited a lot from each other by regular discussions. We sincerely hope that we can hear good news from each other in Boston!</H6></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="description" id="e"><DIV class="container_1"><DIV class="container_1_title"><H3 style="padding-bottom:20px; padding-top:20px;"><STRONG>Quick Link</STRONG></H3></DIV><DIV class="container_1_content"><H5>* Put your mouse on those cards to see what will happen</H5></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="bottom_main"><DIV class="bottom_contact"><H4 style="padding-top:50px;padding-bottom:20px;">CONTACT</H4><H5>Address</H5><H6><UL><LI>Life Science Department</LI><LI>#163 Xianlin Blvd, Qixia District</LI><LI>Nanjing University</LI><LI>Nanjing, Jiangsu Province</LI><LI>P.R. of China</LI><LI>Zip: 210046</LI></UL></H6><H5>Email</H5><H6><UL><LI>nanjing_china@163.com</LI></UL></H6><H5>Social media</H5><H6><UL><LI><A href="https://www.facebook.com/IGEM-Nanjing-China-392481144280345/">Facebook</A></LI><LI><A href="https://twitter.com/nanjing__china">Twitter</A></LI></UL></H6></DIV><DIV class="bottom_sponsors"><H4 style="padding-top:50px;padding-bottom:20px;">SPONSORS</H4><DIV class="bottom_sponsors_1"><DIV class="bottom_sponsors_1_content"><H6>南京大学
