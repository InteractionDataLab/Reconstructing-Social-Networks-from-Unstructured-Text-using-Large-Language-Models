There are two main problems to be solved when we artificially construct solar-driven systems: media for electron transportation and enzymes to harvest electrons to chemical bonds. We successfully solved the two problems in <EM>E.coli</EM> and tested the efficiency of our system using hydrogen production. </H6><P> </P><H6>To be specific, we used hydrogenase to harvest electrons to hydrogen bonds. We assembled six basic parts (BBa_K1958001, BBa_K1958002, BBa_K1958003, BBa_K1958004, BBa_K1958000, BBa_K1958006), which encode for EcHyd-1, into a Biobrick device and successfully expressed it in <EM>E.coli BL21</EM> and tested its hydrogen production function. Besides, as hydrogenase 1 is oxygen intolerant, we tested its hydrogen production efficiency under anaerobic conditions at first, and came up with a unique silicon encapsulation method to maintain its hydrogen production efficiency under aerobic conditions.</H6><P> </P><H6>To solve the problem of electron transduction, we fused PbrR (BBa_K1958007), which is another basic part of our project this year, with a previously existing basic part OmpA (BBa_J36836). PbrR is a kind of metal binding protein which can adsorb cadmium ions. OmpA is one of the outer membrane protein of <EM>E.coli</EM>. By fusing these two proteins together, we can construct a Biobrick device that can display PbrR onto the surface of <EM>E.coli</EM> so that cadmium ions can be fixed! When we add S<SUP>2-</SUP> into the culture medium, CdS can be fixed firmly onto the surface of <EM>E.coli</EM> and conduct electron transportation into the bacteria. The detailed experiment results are listed as follows.</H6></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="description" id="p2"><DIV class="container_1"><DIV class="container_1_title"><H3 style="padding-bottom:20px; padding-top:20px;"><STRONG>Hydrogenase</STRONG></H3></DIV><DIV class="container_1_content"><H4>Figure 1 <EM>hya</EM> gene cluster on the genome of <EM>E.coli</EM></H4><P> </P><H6>To overexpress hydrogenase in <EM>E.coli</EM>, first the recombinant plasmid with genes encoding <EM>E.coli</EM> hydrogenase 1 was constructed. This enzyme is encoded by hya operon where lie in all six genes named hyaABCDEF (BBa_K1958001, BBa_K1958002, BBa_K1958003, BBa_K1958004, BBa_K1958000, BBa_K1958006) on the genome of <EM>E.coli.</EM> The sequence was PCR amplified according to the sequence from our vessel <EM>E.coli</EM> strain BL21 (DE3). We have completed the plasmid pET28a with hya cluster promoted by a T7 promoter. The following figure shows the result of enzyme digestion assay of recombinant plasmid in which our target gene cluster displayed a band around 5.5kb, which indicated successful plasmid construction.</H6><P> </P><H4>Figure 2 (A) Enzyme digestion assay of recombinant plasmid, showing the band <EM>hyaA-F</EM>. </H4><H4>(B) SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant <EM>E.coli</EM>, showing the band of purified HyaA and overexpressed hydrogenase in recombinant strain.</H4><P> </P><H6>To detect induced expression of Ec-Hyd1 we performed SDS-PAGE assay. Note that only the small subunit HyaA had a His-tag for purification on this plasmid. The purified subunit ran as the reference for hydrogenase. The assay showed that recombinant strain overexpressed hydrogenase compared to <EM>E.coli</EM> with empty pET28a plasmids.</H6><P> </P><H4>Figure 3 qualitative test of hydrogenase under anaerobic conditions</H4><P> </P><H6>To determine that our enzyme is effective, we used both qualitative and quantitative tests. Under anaerobic conditions. Solutions for reaction were flushed with nitrogen and then reaction cells were vacuumed and sealed tight. The qualitative test was done after 20h of anaerobic culture (Figure 3A). We found that the recombinant strain overexpresses hydrogenase produces more bubbles than control group. We assumed that this was because more hydrogen evolves in experiment group. WO3 is a redox dye which determines the existence of reduction force in the environment with a color change to blue, compared to its original green. Again in 20h of anaerobic culture (Figure 3B), the WO3 powders displayed a darker color in the recombinant strain than that of native <EM>E.coli</EM> strain. We assumed that recombinant strain has created more reduction force than native <EM>E.coli</EM> strain.</H6><P> </P><H4>Figure 4 gas chromatography quantitative test of hydrogenase under anaerobic condition</H4><P> </P><H6>To measure the exact quantity of hydrogen produced under 20h of anaerobic culture, a gas chromatography (GC) test on samples taken from reaction flask headspace (600mL) was done accordingly later. Nitrogen was the gas carrier and bulk H<SUB>2</SUB> was run as the reference, which showed a peak at approximately 1.4 minute (Figure 4A). A standard curve (Figure 4B) was completed to measure exact quantity of hydrogen in the samples. According to our result, the control group (Figure 4C) produced 6.88μmol hydrogen in headspace under 0.5% oxygen proportion. This marked the level of native fermentation of <EM>E.coli</EM>. Compared to control group the recombinant group (Figure 4D) obviously produced more hydrogen, which is 14.71μmol in the headspace under same oxygen level (Figure 4E). This is double the production of native fermentation which thus proves that our enzyme is effective under anaerobic conditions. </H6></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="description" id="p3"><DIV class="container_1"><DIV class="container_1_title"><H3 style="padding-bottom:20px; padding-top:20px;"><STRONG>PbrR based artificial PS system</STRONG></H3></DIV><DIV class="container_1_content"><H4>Figure 5 sketch map for MV photocatalytic reduction</H4><P> </P><H6>Second the PbrR (BBa_K1958007) based artificial PS system is constructed according to our design. The first step to verify an artificial PS system is to test its photocatalytic capability. The redox dye methyl viologen (MV) is a well-establish indicator. In a photocatalytic reaction, photons spark excited electron on the semiconductor which then reduce MV from its +2 oxidized state to +1 reduced state (Figure 5).

Groups that either lacked induced expression or necessary ions to build semiconductors were the supposed negative control.
