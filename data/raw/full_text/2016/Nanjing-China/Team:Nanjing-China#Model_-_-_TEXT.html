Model
Overview
Modeling plays an increasingly vital role in the research of synthetic biology. Then, what is modeling? Modeling aims to build and use a model which provides a theoretical explanation for a phenomenon in simpler fashion than real situation. The procedure of modeling consists of observing a phenomenon, identifying influential parameters and filtering decisive ones. According to the results of modeling, you may predict what would happen under different conditions.
 
In the modeling part, we have now completed two models:
 
In the first model, we have constructed a hydrogen production system through the diffusion equation of gas. In this system, we obtained the steady state solution of hydrogen-oxygen, and obtained the hydrogen-oxygen concentration, which is consistent with the experimental data.
 
In the second model, we used the Logistics equation and the Gompertz equation to fit the data of the growth phase of E. coli, and compared the correlation parameters, which proved the stability of the encapsulation.
 
Through modeling, we know hydrogen bio-production system better and are given an essential guidance to our project. Besides, we can also find out whether our wet lab results conform to the modeling results.
 
Here comes our modeling.
Model 1: Simulation of hydrogen production system
Model 2: Growth Curve Fitting
