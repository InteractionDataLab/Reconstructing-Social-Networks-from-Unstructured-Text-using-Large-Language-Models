Human Practices Silver
This year, our team Nanjing-China is mainly focused on developing new energy to deal with current energy crisis. Thus it is important for us to know both the public opinion about traditional chemical energy and development of new energy such as solar energy and hydrogen energy, as well as advice from experts about how to tailor our project to the current need. We also take the responsibility to propagate the idea of energy conservation and educate the young kids about synthetic biology. Therefore, we think we are qualified for the Human Practice silver medal.

Human Practices Gold
Up to now, we have investigated the public opinion about current energy issues and our project by questionnaires, propagated our project to the community by social activities and promoted education among primary school students, as is illustrated in Human Practice Silver. In order to get more ideas and information about our project and tailor it to the current development, we conducted counselling with experts in hydrogen production who gave us significant guidelines to our projects. We also attended as many as conferences as possible to communicate our ideas with students from other universities and establish collaborations with other teams. These wonderful human practice experiences indeed benefit our project and we also spread the principles and ideas of our project to iGEMers all around China. Therefore, we think we are qualified for the human practices gold medal.

Integrated Human Practices
This year, our project is focused on hydrogen energy, which is a new form of energy. When it comes to new energy development, there are mainly three aspects that should be considered in our humble opinion, efficiency, technology and cost.
 
Efficiency mains that the development of this kind of new energy is worthwhile and bears advantages over traditional chemical energy. Thus we counselled experts in hydrogen production fields about current bottlenecks in hydrogen production.
 
Technology mains the techniques and principles used in hydrogen production that facilitate its utilization in industry. We interviewed chemists and biologists about details of the engineered bacteria, such as how electrons can be conducted across the plasma membrane.
 
Cost mains not only the expenses used in the development of hydrogen, but the time input as well. We must gain support from the public and government in order to afford the cost of new energy development. Therefore, we designed questionnaires at first to investigate the public opinion about hydrogen energy. We also propagated the advantage of hydrogen as new energy as well as our projects to the communities. We even opened up our lab to primary school students to attract more attention to synthetic biology as well as to promote education.
 
Besides these efforts, we also attended many conferences to not only keep in touch with iGEMers, but promoting our projects as well. These young scientists can always come up with interesting ideas! In addition, we also spare no efforts to help iGEM teams in China and even help two universities to establish new teams, which is very meaningful and exciting!
