Journal
In March, we founded our team and recruited our team members, after with we divided our team members into several groups and each group was responsible for one part of the competition. We were also busy brainstorming about our project and signing up for iGEM competition. Besides, we started to help students from Southeast University to help them build a new team.
 
In April, we confirmed our project. A majority of the team members wanted to be focused on hydrogen production. Then we searched online and read many articles related to our project. We also consulted many experts in hydrogen production and discussed our projects with instructors. We also made a plan about the procedures of all the experiments.
 
In May, we were busy with kit construction and part construction. We were also contacting different authorities and scheduled for community activities. We even designed questionnaires to collect public opinion about hydrogen production and our project.
 
In June, we went on with part construction and lab work. We also opened our lab to primary school students and attended conferences in ZJU and met with many other iGEMers in China. Team members from TMMU-China visited us and we gave them many important suggestions. We think it is really important to help new iGEMers!
 
In July, we successfully constructed all our parts and expressed hydrogenase. We began to test the hydrogen production efficiency and explore conditions for CdS precipitation and silicon encapsulation. Meanwhile, we did some human practices such as community propagation, interviews and collaborations with other iGEMers!
 
In August, we still spared no efforts to continue lab work and also attended the CCiC conference in Guangzhou and presented our project to Chinese iGEM teams.
 
In September, we were engaged in some details of lab work and were invited by TMMU-China for a conference. We are also busy with wiki construction, logo design and visa application.
 
In October, everyone is busy with the project, from lab work, data analysis, writing staff, modeling to human practices. We also rehearse our presentation several times before going to Boston.
Protocols
 
DNA purification/Axygen gel extraction
 
1. Excise the agarose gel slice containing the DNA fragment of interest with a clean, sharp scalpel under ultraviolet illumination.
 
2. Absorb the liquids left on the surface of the gel slices using paper towels. Weigh gel slice (tare with empty tube).
 
3. Add 3 volumes of DE-A buffer per mg of gel (so a 100mg gel gets 300ul of buffer).
 
4. Resuspend the gel in Buffer DE-A by vortexing. Heat at 75℃ until the gel is completely dissolved (keep heating for 6-8 minutes). If low-melt agarose gel is used, you may heat it at 40℃. Intermittently vortexing every 2-3 minutes will do a lot of help to accelerate the solubilization.
 
Note: Buffer DE-A is red liquid, so you can observe the color to make sure the gel is fully dissolved.
 
5. Add 0.5× Buffer DE-A volume of Buffer DE-B and mix. If the DNA fragment is less than 400bp, supplement further with a 1×sample volume of isopropanol.
 
Note: After the addition of DE-B, the solution should be in the uniform color of yellow.
 
6. Place a Miniprep column into a 2ml microfuge tube (provided). Transfer the solubilized agarose from the step above into the column. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
 
7. Return the Miniprep column to the 2ml microfuge tube and add 500ul of Buffer W1. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 30 seconds. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
 
8. Return the Miniprep column to the 2ml microfuge tube and add 700ul of Buffer W2. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 30 seconds. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
 
9 Place the Miniprep column back into the 2ml microfuge tube. Add a second 700ul of Buffer W2 and centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
 
10. Place the Miniprep column back into the 2ml microfuge tube. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute.

Note: Pre-warm the ddH2O at 65℃ will generally improve elution efficiency.
