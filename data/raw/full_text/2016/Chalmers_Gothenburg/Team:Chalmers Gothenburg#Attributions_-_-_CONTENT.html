Their goodwill and friendliness has greatly benefited all parts of the project.</P><H2>Principal Investigators</H2><P class="text"><B>Verena Siewers</B> is a project leader in Systems and Synthetic Biology Group at Chalmers. Her main research interest is the application of yeast as a cell factory for sustainable production of a variety of chemicals, including biofuels. As the main supervisor of the project she was available for questions, help and motivation without compromising the autonomy of the project. From the planning stages right up to the Jamboree. </P><P class="text"><B>Ivan Mijakovic</B>, Director of the Chalmers Area of Advance Life Science Engineering and professor at the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering. He and his group are researching signaling and regulation in bacterial cells, focusing in particular on regulatory phenomena based on protein phosphorylation. He made a big difference to us, both in terms of funding and expertise.</P><H2>Instructors</H2><P class="text"><B>Gustaf Edman</B>, MSc student, <B>Raphael Ferreira</B>, <B>David Bergenholm</B>, PhD students, are all former iGEM participants. Their experiences with practical and theoretical systems biology as well as being familiar with the competition was a great help to us. They were always ready to discuss and help us with our choice of primers, PCR conditions, provide us with protocols, preparing us for our presentation and many other things. The list is very long and their efforts have truly been appreciated. We also got chocolate cake once.</P><H2>Other teams</H2><H3><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Amsterdam">The 2015 Amsterdam iGEM team</A></H3><P class="text">Our project starts roughly where the 2015 Amsterdam iGEM team left off, they were undoubtedly our biggest inspiration. We strived to expand on their idea through creating a modular library of symbiotic organisms to suit the needs of chemical synthesis demands. The possible implications of a successful development of this idea is what sparked our interest. </P><H2>Department of Biology and Biological Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology</H2><P class="text">We feel privileged to have had unlimited access to the Chalmers Systems Biology lab and thankful for the help and tolerance of the researchers we shared space with.</P><P class="text"><B>Dr. Eva Albers</B> contributed with her expertise within the field of microalgal research and cultivating photosynthetic organisms.</P><P class="text"><B>Cyrielle Bonzom</B>, PhD student, is researching enzyme production and immobilization in mesoporous materials.
