The project
Current methods of chemical synthesis from petroleum have led to great environmental              disruption and continue to be a strong contributor to the emission of greenhouse gases.             Biosynthesis is known to be the most viable alternative to the aforementioned methods.              However, biosynthesis of certain products has a high cost-to-benefit ratio, with substrate              comprising over 60% of the total costs for industrial fermentation in most cases. With this             in mind, our solution is to create a self-sustaining microbial production platform that produces             its own substrate using photosynthesis. Our project revolves around creating a co-culture where             a cyanobacterium provides the heterotrophic production organisms with the carbon source. In              return, the production organism provides an amino acid the auxotrophic cyanobacterium needs. By              making several different species compatible with the synthetic symbiosis, our platform will allow              for efficient conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide into desired products in an environmentally              friendly and sustainable way.
