TEAM
We are a multicultural team of 12 students from Chalmers        University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, with a shared interest        in synthetic biology. The goal of our project is to help improve the world         that we all share and to inspire people to learn and explore the field of        synthetic biology.
All work presented on this wiki was done by the Team members unless stated otherwise.
