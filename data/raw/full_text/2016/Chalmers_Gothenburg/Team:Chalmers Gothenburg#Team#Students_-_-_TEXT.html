Jonathan Aldridge
Human Practices
Big time science nerd and last year Master student, will be starting his Master's thesis the day he gets home from Boston. When not geeking out about science stuff, he spends most of his time in the gym.

Analia Banacore
Wet lab
Uruguayan  in the last year of a Master in Molecular Biology at Gothenburg University, but likes to hang out with Chalmers people so joined IGEM team to have fun and learn. Survived doing most of the growth trials and begged S. cerevisiae to join the team, with no luck.

Anton Björk
Wet lab
Youngest member of the team, just finished the second year of Biotechnology BSc. Currently trying to figure out which masters to choose, so joined iGEM to find out what he wants to do in the future. Thinks bioinformatics, big data handling and large scale experimental techniques are especially interesting.

Martin Boström
Wiki/simulation
Last year Master student whose iGEM responsibilities include wiki design and modelling. Being a massive computer nerd, Martin likes creating scripts for everyday tasks that other people seem to find excessive and/or unnecessary.

Staffan Godman
Wet lab
Third year Biotech BSc student who always had an interest in genetics. The more you learn, the more you think; this is like science fiction. I am happy to work in the wet lab but I also have an interest in bioinformatics. When I’m not doing all the science stuff I regularly make music and play shows with my band, come see us next time!

Carl Möller
Wet lab
Doing the first year on a Master in Biomedical Engineering but has his heart in Biotechnology. Focusing on designing constructs and planning the wet lab while keeping my hands of the in silico. Being a workhorse in the wet lab, logging more PCR hours than everyone combined.

Anna Vidal
Wet lab
Biochemist from Catalonia in her 2nd year of MSc in Gothenburg. Music and epigenetic passionate, guitar player, hippy feminist and metalhead. Proud of her gels and very glad to carry on genetic engineering for an environmental good purpose - and to include some artistic traces as well.
