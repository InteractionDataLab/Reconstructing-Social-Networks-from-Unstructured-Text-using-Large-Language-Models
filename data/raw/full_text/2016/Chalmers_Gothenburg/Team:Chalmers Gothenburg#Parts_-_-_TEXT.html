Parts
pAQR1 – BBa_K2030000
The promoter to the AQR1 gene. AQR1 codes for a transporter that enhances secretion of excess amino acids. The transcription of AQR1 is induced by amino acids [1].
The part was taken from the S. cerevisiae genome.
pPCK1 – BBa_K2030001
The promoter to the PCK1 gene. PCK1 codes for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, an enzyme involved in converting oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvate and carbon dioxide [2]. The promoter pPCK1 has an activity which is induced by acetate, glycerol or ethanol [3].
The part was taken from the S. cerevisiae genome.
Acetate kinase (AckA) – BBa_K2030002
The coding region of the AckA gene. The gene codes for acetate kinase, an enzyme which is part of the Phosphate acetyltransferase-acetate kinase pathway and is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of acetyl-CoA into acetate [4].
The part was taken from the Synechocystis genome.
pPYK2 – BBa_K2030003
The promoter to the PYK2 gene. PYK2 codes for pyruvate kinase, an essential enzyme in the glycolysis that catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP into pyruvate and ATP [5]. Transcription of PYK2 is repressed by glucose [6].
The part was taken from the S. cerevisiae genome.
pGLN1 – Bba_K2030004
The promoter to the GLN1 gene. GLN1 codes for glutamine synthetase, catalyzing the conversion of glutamate and ammonia into glutamine [7]. This part was not sent into the part registry due to it having illegal restriction sites for biobricks.
The part was taken from S. cerevisiae genome.
