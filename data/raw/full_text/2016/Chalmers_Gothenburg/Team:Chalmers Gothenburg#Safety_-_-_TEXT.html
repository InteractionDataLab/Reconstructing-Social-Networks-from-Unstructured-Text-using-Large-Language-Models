Safety
Before starting the wet lab part of the project all team members             had to take part in a safety lecture held by the lab manager at the Systems and              synthetic biology department. During this lecture the team learned how to handle              chemicals and waste in the lab, we also had a lab tour where the safety equipment             were introduced. During the lab tour all the responsible research engineers were             present and gave us introductions to all of the different lab equipments they are              responsible for.
As a safety measurement, each team member had to read the             materials safety data sheet for the materials used and the KLARA risk assessments             of the machines handled during the summer. Each member then had to sign the risk              declaration to testify that one had taken part of this information and gain access              to the laboratory.
