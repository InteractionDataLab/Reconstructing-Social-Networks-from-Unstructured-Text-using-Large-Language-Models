CONFERENCE OF CHINA IGEMER'S COMMITTEE
The CCiC of 2016 was held in Sun Yat-sen University from September 2nd to 4th, hosted by SYSU School of Life Science. It was a wonderful jamboree in which 36 participating iGEM teams, including our team SCUT-China_A, from all over the country got together giving great presentations and sharing many different ideas.
After hearing our presentation, HaoQian Zhang，other professors from SYSU and iGEMers from other universities  gave us some valuable advices on our program. Every team showed great passion on the presentation and strong commitment to their project. We also gave advices to other iGEM teams in the meantime as many as possible.
COLLABORATION WITH Team SCU-China
After the CCIC, the project of team SCU-China appealed to us, consequently we start a collaboration with this team. We found they were also facing the problems of heterologous protein expression so we’ve reached an agreement that we provide them with three strains, which are Eco.li RIPL, Eco.li Rosetta and Eco.li pGr07, to help them with their heterologous protein expression. As return, they will send us a special strain of E.coli that has the odour gene knocked out to help with our bacterium stinking problem, which is considered to be a big obstacle to the industrial applications of our engineered bacteria.
COLLABORATION WITH iGEM Team FAFU-China
This year, the project of FAFU iGEM team is aimed at killing the mosquitoes by restructuring Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (a species of algae)and growing them in the waters.
Therefore, the temperature of the mosquito-breeding waters area will be a key to their project. In order to offer them certain help, we chose several mosquito-breeding waters areas in guangdong—one of the most mosquito-breeding regions in China—to measure both the outdoor temperature and the water temperature, which were then collected and sent back to FAFU iGEM team.
Meanwhile, we are facing a problem as we conduct effect testing of our oil biodesulfurization, which is that our university is not equipped with the certain device that could accurately detect the sulfur element in oil, such as Micro-Coulomete. For that matter, FAFU team is willing to provide us with technical support. They will help analyze the crude oil sample we send to them which has been treated with our engineered bacteria, with Micro-Coulometer that their school owns, and then send back the analysis results to us.
