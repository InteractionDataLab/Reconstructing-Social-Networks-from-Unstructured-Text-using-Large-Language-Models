NOTEBOOK
Sunday 15th May
Our idea was passed in the school-level match, our team was finally set up after almost one month`s working. iGEM, we were coming.
Saturday 6th June
The design of experiment was finished, the gene would be sent in four weeks less. The leader said we would focus on the other parts.
Friday 24th June
We collected the works the iGEMer used to finish on our project and made it a Data Pool, which made us more understand the real meaning of our works.
Monday 11th July
Today is third day after final exam, we had chatted a lot about our project. After the discussion, we chose different type groups which we were interested about. The professor told us the train would be hard. God, crush it on me!!
Tuesday 12th July
Today we almost watched the advisors doing the experiment the whole time. They told us how to use the basic tools and what we should pay more attentions on, especial about protecting ourselves. And I inoculated my first E.coli.
Thursday 14th July
We started to learn about the molecular experiment, Luo got a wonderful result in his trying. The human practice group put out our questionnaires, and we were told to give it away. Kuria said she was working on the logo and the logo would be on fire. Waiting for the fire :).
Friday 15th July
Our gene arrived! Luo said we could work as different groups now. I wish the gene circuit would be finished as fast as it could be.
Wednesday 17th July
The logo of our team was completed. I have to commend Kuria for her painting. It was on fire indeed, but most of our team said it looks like a turkey. LOL
Saturday 13th August
The construction of expression cassette and the engineering bacterium succeeded. The fermentation and induction would start. We will use the liquid chromatography to test the desulfur-ability of our bacterium by using the whole cell catalysis.
Monday 15th August
The result of protein electrophoresis and liquid chromatography showed us the short of our circuit. Luo is going to try a new approach, there is a long way to go. But the HP group communicated with Professor Liu, which one gave us some helpful advises.
Wednesday 18th August
The HP group figured the assessment problem of economic benefit and industrial application design issue out. And the enzyme ratio was determined. That may guide the enzyme proportion expression circuit design.
Tuesday 30th August
Causing the water-oil ratio was not done much previously, we spent lot of time to get the way to solve the problem. But today we did it well. And there is one less thing to worry about.
Sunday 4th September
We attended the CCIC hold by SYSU these days, the students and teachers in SYSU were very kind and gave us a huge chance to present our idea. So many teams came to Guangzhou and showed us the power of iGEMer. Thanks for the support by SYSU.
Saturday 10th September
After the CCIC, we were very interested in the idea of the SCU-China and FAFU-China. We contacted with them and talked a lot about each other`s works. After that we thought we could help each other to finish our project, and we are working on that.
Friday 16th September
The HP group got a great news again, we did supplements for Policy & System of Oil development. I wish the experiment would get as smooth as HP. Kuria made a new logo, it`s not bad.
Wednesday 21st September
The circuit 2.0 was timely got, the new one carried the Lac I promotor instead of T7 one. We were excited hearing the news. And now the circle will begin again. We will induce the expression of the dsz genes under the Plac promoter, 1 mM IPTG was added to the medium. Cultures were incubated 12h at 16 °C.
Thursday 22nd September
The team uniform arrived!! We will be smart and cool putting the uniform on.
Sunday 25th September
  After the second fermentation and induction, we analyzed the data and were not satisfied yet. The liquid chromatography came out, it seems not so good. There is not much time here, would we finish the whole program in time as we wish?
Thursday 29th September
The home page of our wiki was finished. And now we would put the result on the wiki later on. And FYI, the home page is kind of darker than I thought.
Saturday 1st October
Today we went to the HEMC center lake park to test the temperature of the center lake. The members of FAFU said they wanted to know whether the environment of Guangzhou be fit to their stains or not.
Wednesday 5th October
Recently, we flung ourselves to our wiki.
Thursday 13th October
We did it! After the exhausting experiment day after day, we finally got the right order cassette. Actually our advisor did a lot favor to us, we hope the circuit 3.0 would dazzle us. We arranged a meeting with the Guangzhou Environmental Protection Administration.
