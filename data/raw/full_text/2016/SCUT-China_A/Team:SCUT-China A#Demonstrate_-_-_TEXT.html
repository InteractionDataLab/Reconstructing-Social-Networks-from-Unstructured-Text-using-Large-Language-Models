To know our project working under real industrial condition, we used n-dodecane with DBT (final concentration is 1mM) to simulate oil and the ratio of organic mixture and water is 1:9, which was based on our mathematic modeling.
We added induced bacteria into the mixed system at an initial A600 of 2.0. After the reaction of 6 hours, we took 1 ml sample which would be tested by HPLC (as shown in Figure 1).
The result shows clearly the generation of 2-HBP which means success of our project. Because it’s only a pre-experiment that we didn’t use equipment such as ultrasonator, the result does not show a high-efficiency desulfurization. We will do 2L-system desulfurization experiment in the next step.

The result shows significant conclusions which will guide us in the next step:
a.The elements of oil will nearly not be metabolized or absorbed by our engineered bacteria in oil-water phrases.
b.Our engineered bacteria can convert DBT into 2-HBP successfully in oil-water phrases.
c.Very little organic elements will be left in aqueous phase.
In future, we will use crude oil to test our engineered bacteria and we will send our samples to FAFU (Fujian Agriculture and Forest University) to assess our results using Micro coulomb meter by the help of FAFU-China iGEM team.
