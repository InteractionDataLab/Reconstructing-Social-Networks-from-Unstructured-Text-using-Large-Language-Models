Luo Yifan
Luo Yifan is the leader of our team, taking charge of the design and execution of our project. He did his best to overcome all the obstacles to the project and cheer up the morale of the entire project team.
Guo Zhijie
Guo Zhijie is our vice captain, who in the early stage of the project participated in laborious molecular cloning and later devoted himself to the mathematic modeling of our project. Moreover, he managed all the financial stuff for our team.
Liu Zhengyu
Liu Zhengyu is a junior student majoring in Biotechnology. He is in charge of most of the laborious molecular cloning and also is the head of the human practice group. He did a very good job in balancing study with experiments, and arranging group assignments as well.
Lai Jiahan
Lai Jiahan, a junior Biotechnology major, is in charge of all the design tasks including team uniform, project PPT, poster, wiki design&editing and so on. Early in the project, she also participated in the task of molecular cloning.
Zhang Guangming
Zhang Guangming is a junior undergraduate majoring in Biopharmacy and secondly in economics. Most of the time he dealt with the lab, working as the main force in the experimental part. Besides, he does a great job in giving a presentation for our project.
Liu Tianyang
Liu Tianyang, a junior undergraduate majoring in Biopharmacy, is responsible for the experimental part together with Zhang. During the iGEM period, she spent most of her time on the lab doing experiments.
Zhao Yingying
Zhao Yingying is a junior undergraduate majoring in Biopharmacy. She completed the modeling task together with Guo and showed a good command of data processing. After finishing the modeling part, she devoted herself to the heavy work of experiments.
Chen Siyun
Chen Siyun, a junior undergraduate majoring in Biopharmacy, is responsible for the information collecting and sorting in human practice. In later stages she also helped with the experiments.
Zhao Jinhui
Zhao Jinhui is a junior undergraduate majoring in Bioengineering. He helped with the experiments in the early phases. Then he took part in human practice.
Peng Yu
Peng Yu is a junior undergraduate majoring in Software Engineering. As our team is in lack of the expertise in wiki building in later stages, he decided to join us and helped building our wiki with his remarkable programming ability. No doubt he has become one of our family.
Xu Xuan
Xu Xuan is a junior high school student. He attended IGEM in order to obtain more interesting and professional knowledge in the synthetic biology's field. He took part in experiments during summer vacation, and offered us great help with the translations of modeling documents and data processing. He enjoys being a part of this cozy family.
Advisor
Xiao Ruiming, a senior undergraduate majoring in bio-engineering, is a member of experimental group  of team 2015-SCUT and becomes an adviser of SCUT-China A team this year. He has been working on molecular construction and microbial culture experiments for a long period. He practiced his experimental skill diligently to help finish the task and solve related problems, and Xiao firmly believes that they will make a great achievement this year.

Advisor
Zhao Yaran
Zhao Yaran, a senior undergraduate majoring in bio-engineering, is the teemleader of the 2015 iGEM team SCUT-China.He has been working on this competition three years. This summer, he had provided us with lots of suggestions on project design，police & practice and final presentation.
Advisor
Zhizheng Wang
Zhizheng Wang is the senior student of SCUT. It is the third time he has participated in iGEM, where the competition runs throughout his whole undergraduate life. This year he works as an advisor in Human Practice part, hoping to play well and enjoy a lot.
Advisor
Liu Hai
Liu Hai is a senior student of SCUT majoring in mathematics. This year, he participated in our project as a modeling advisor and gave us many expert instructions on our oil-water system modeling, we really appreciate it.
Instuctors
Liao Xihao
Liao Xihao, a Ph.D. candidate in college of Biology Science and Engineering of SCUT, helped promoting our project from the very beginning. Not only had he assisted us in designing the project, but also he was always patiently instructing us in skills of molecular experimental operations and the design of our experiments.
Li Lu
Li Lu is a Ph.D. student in college of Biology Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology. She provided our team with many valuable guidance on experimental operations related to the using of desulfurized bacteria.
