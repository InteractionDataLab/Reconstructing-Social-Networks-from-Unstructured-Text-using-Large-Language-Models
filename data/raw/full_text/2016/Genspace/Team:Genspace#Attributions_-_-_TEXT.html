Members of the Genspace iGEM team did all the part design, wet lab work, wiki development, and will do the poster and presentation material generation. Mentors offered advice and training in both lab safety and lab techniques and proofed the final submissions (wiki, registry) but did not participate in lab work. DNA that our team modified to make into BioBrick parts and composite parts were synthesized for us by IDT. A member of Genspace (Ali Schachtschneider, a professional designer) who is not on the team helped us design the team logo.
