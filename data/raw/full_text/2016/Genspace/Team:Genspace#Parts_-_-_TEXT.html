Complete Parts Summary
We uploaded 16 new parts to the online registry.
We synthesized and submitted 9 new DNA parts.
We characterized 2 new parts we submitted ( BBa_K2128100 and BBa_K2128104 )
We improved the characterization of pSB1C3 , the iGem standard submission backbone, by using qPCR to better quantify copy number.
