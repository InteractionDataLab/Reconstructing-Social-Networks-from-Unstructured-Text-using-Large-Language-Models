Project Description
The world’s cutest extremophile is the tardigrade, a multicellular microscopic organism found in almost every environment on earth. Also known as ‘water bears’, these little creatures can survive the dryness and cold of outer space when in their cryptobiotic state.  We transferred the tardigrade proteins thought to be responsible for this amazing resilience to other organisms to see if they provided protection from desiccation. Our results suggest that these proteins could be valuable additives to bacterial cultures and protein formulations, potentially acting as a preservative during storage.
Since tardigrades are somewhere between C. elegans and Drosophila on the tree of life and have limbs, they are attractive models for studying development. We investigated how this might be achieved by using CRISPR to knock out tardigrade genes implicated in development.
Additionally, we developed a novel qPCR-based method for measuring plasmid copy number.

Accomplishments
We uploaded 16 new parts to the online registry.
We synthesized and submitted 9 new DNA parts (see parts page for complete list).
We characterized 2 new parts we submitted ( BBa_K2128100 and BBa_K2128104 )
We improved the characterization of pSB1C3 , the iGem standard submission backbone, by using qPCR to better quantify copy number .
Collaborated with 3 other iGEM teams : Stony Brook, BioBrick Foundation, and University of Georgia Teams
Ran 3 public engagement events around synthetic biology and use of CRISPR
Integrated human practices into project design when using CRISPR
Improved characterization of pSB1C3 by developing a new method to measure copy number more precisely
Demonstrated that tardigrade proteins can protect E. coli from desiccation.
