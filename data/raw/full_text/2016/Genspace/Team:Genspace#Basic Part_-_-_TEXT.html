Basic Parts
We created 6 protein coding parts for use in E. coli consisting of proteins originally found in Tardigrades.
We created 2 fluorescent protein coding parts codon optimised for C. elegans for use in Tardigrades.
We created 1 Tardigrade Promoter and Terminator with 3’ and 5’ UTR.
Please refer to our complete parts page for more detail.
