Results
Here you can find the results of our subprojects towards achieving our big goal of establishing artificial endosymbiosis and providing the iGEM community with a list of fully characterized kill switches.
Dependency. Keeps the system together.
In order to guarantee the fitness of  the host organism as well as the invading cell,                 we established different exchange-based dependencies. A malonate-based dependency with                 the invading E. coli cell as the malonate source and a protein based dependency                 complementing essential gene knockout.

Fusion. Brings the system together.
Since our whole project relies on the utilization of the principles of endosymbiosis for production purposes, we had to decide for a method to bring the organisms together. This was accomplished by modification and optimization of a protocol using polyethylene glycol (PEG).

Production Line. Novel system for modular synthesis.
Design of a production line that starts with limonene production in E. coli and export in S. cerevisiae, where the limonene gets hydroxylated to the cancer drug perillyl alcohol and exported to the media.

Modeling. Evolutionary stability analysis of killswitches.
Quantitative work using mathematical modeling and numerics to study genetical killswitches. Treated as                 genetic regulatory networks, the stability of network topologies against evolution - selection and mutation -                 is studied.
