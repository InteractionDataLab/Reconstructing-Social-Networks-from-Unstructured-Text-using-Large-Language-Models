                In our project we want to establish a new production platform for biofuel production
                based on ‘artificial endosymbiosis’. We choose two of the most used and well established
                model organisms in genetic engineering: <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I> and <I>Escherichia coli</I>.
                By following and extending the guidelines for responsible and safe research, we are able
                to ensure minimal risks to experimenter and environment. Here, you can find all important
                safety aspects we followed through the course of this summer. Additionally, we focused a
                whole side project on safety - we created a complete database of all kill switches ever
                designed within the iGEM competition and were able to model four of them in detail.

                Before starting our lab work, all students received a detailed safety instruction by covering
                all important aspects of working safely. This instruction was held by the safety officer of the
                Max Planck Institute for terrestrial microbiology Prof. Dr. Brandis-Heep, as well as Volker Vincon.
                A lab specific safety instruction was also given by our instructors. This covered for example:

                 Additionally, each student received an in depth training in every facility and for every instrument
                 we had to work in or with (e.g. confocal microscope, FACS, HPLC) and was supervised during their measurements.
            </P></DIV></DIV><DIV><H3 class="text-center">Project Safety</H3></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12 text-justify"><P>
                 Since our project is meant to work as an industrial scale production, we wanted to keep safety
                 issues as minimal as possible. Especially concerning our ‘endosymbiosis’ approach, we rejected
                 several ideas for safety reasons. In the beginning of our project we wanted to use invasin and
                 listeriolysin as an invasion method for our symbionts - this mechanism originates from
                 <I>Yersinia pestis</I> and <I>Yersinia tuberculosis</I> and is part of their virulence factors,
                 which makes them BSL3 and BSL2 organisms, respectively. Therefore, we choose a different and passive
                 approach,  a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated fusion of vesicle enclosed microorganisms with
                 yeast spheroplasts, which does not involve any pathogenic factors and therefore is harmless for
                 humans and environment. During the lab work only BSL1 organisms have been handled, such as
                 different strains of <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I>, <I>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</I> and
                 <I>Escherichia coli</I>.

                 In Germany there are several important laws and regulations that provide all information
                 about the handling with chemicals and biological samples. The so called
                 <A href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gentg/">Gentechnikgesetz</A>, a law regarding
                 regulations in genetical engineering, covers all regulations we mentioned in the ‘Lab Safety’
                 part. Additionally, there is the
                 <A href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/biostoffv_2013/index.html">Biostoffverordnung</A>,
                 which covers personal protection when working with biological samples and several chemicals.
                 A detailed list of all organisms and their risk assessments can be found in the
                 <A href="http://www.bvl.bund.de/DE/06_Gentechnik/03_Antragsteller/06_Institutionen_fuer_biologische_Sicherheit/01_ZKBS/03_Organismenliste/gentechnik_zkbs_organismenliste_node.html">Organismenliste</A>.

                We think safety, especially concerning biocontainment, is an issue all
                of us need to assess. Instead of designing our own kill switch, we took advantage of the numerous
                kill switches already implemented in the iGEM database. We were creating a <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Marburg/Modeling">model</A>
                describing their escape probability in terms of evolutionary stability understanding them as a genetic network.
                We did so in collaboration with the iGEM team of <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Lethbridge">Lethbridge</A>,
                who performed experimental work in order to verify our model. In addition to the modeling of
                several kill switches, we included all kill switches ever mentioned in iGEM since its beginning in
                2004 in a database. This
                collection is available for download <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Marburg/Modeling/Kill_Switch_Database">here</A>.
                Hopefully this can help many teams to gain insight in already existing kill switches, their stability
                and how to improve the already available kill switches.
