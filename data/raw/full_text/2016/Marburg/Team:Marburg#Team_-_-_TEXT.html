Team Members
Patrick Gerlinger
Master student in Molecular and Cellular Biology.   I joined the iGEM team to learn more about synthetic biology and to have the opportunity to work on a project developed by us students.
Nikolai Huwa
Master student in Chemistry. During my time in the iGEM team I got particularly fascinated by science as a heuristic approach.
Christoph Kahle
Master student in Agricultural Economics.  iGEM gives me the great opportunity to look beyond the borders of my study subject and to get insights into synthetic biology.
Martin Lellep
Master student in Physics. I joined the iGEM Team Marburg in order to work quantitatively in a new field of science using physical methods. I also learned about project management in scientific teams and independent research.
Maria Lindner
Master student in Molecular and Cellular Biology. iGEM taught me a lot about myself.
Steffen Lütke
Master student in Molecular and Cellular Biology. iGEM offers an extraordinary network of partners in research and industries.
Bastian Pook
Master student in Molecular and Cellular Biology. A great experience and so much more. It was a blast.
Lena Schmidt
Bachelor student in Media Studies. I joined the iGEM Marburg team to refresh my design knowledge.  And of course the idea travelling to the USA and to join the Giant Jamboree was tempting.
The Advisors and Instructors
Daniel Hürtgen
PhD Candidate at the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology and LOEWE-Center for Synthetic Microbiology (Synmikro). I`m in the group of Prof. Dr. Victor Sourjik and I study minimal systems and molecular machines.
Tarryn Miller
PhD Candidate in Microbiology at the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology.                     I am in the working group of Dr. Tobias Erb and I study synthetic CO2 fixation.
