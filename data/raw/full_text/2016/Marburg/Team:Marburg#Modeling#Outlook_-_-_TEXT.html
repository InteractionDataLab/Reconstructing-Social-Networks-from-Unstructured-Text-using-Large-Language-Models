Quantitative evolutionary stability analysis of kill switches
« Results
Outlook
We have shown that a well-designed kill switch can out-compete a simple design in terms of evolutionary                 stability even though it might introduce additional complexity to the kill switch construct. However,                 this depends on the topological details and is no general statement, yet. Using further abstract kill                 switch topologies, optimizing for the critical kill switch topology suggests itself. This follows the                 famous quote "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler" [1] : Design guidelines                 for minimal kill switch topology complexity and a maximal evolutionary stability is crucial for all                 real-life applications of kill switches. Our tool provides opportunities to tackle this question.
Studying kill switch designs at hand and leaving the search for general guidelines is very useful for the                 particular application. This can help characterizing already existing or planned projects and quantify their                 safety concerns. Thus, the tool is not only interesting for future iGEM teams but also applications beyond iGEM.
Integrating the results about evolutionary stability in the database is another step to a great kill switch                 documentation that is not available in iGEM until now.
Small modifications of the framework enable to use the tool to quantify evolutionary stability of other constructs                 than kill switches only. Since all constructs suffer from mutations, this is an essential question for everybody building                 biological constructs.
Finally, we think that our tool is useful for future scientists – in iGEM and beyond. More potential projects, further                 information and other scientific exchange is welcome (Martin Lellep, martin.lellep@physik.uni-marburg.de ).
