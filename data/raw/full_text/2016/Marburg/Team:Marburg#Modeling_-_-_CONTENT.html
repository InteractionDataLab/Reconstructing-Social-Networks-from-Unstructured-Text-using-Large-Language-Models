                    Well constructed kill switches enable to safely keep genetically modified organisms in fermentation setups for long times.
                    We develop a genetic algorithm based tool to quantify a kill switch design in terms of its evolutionary stability. A design
                    providing redundant toxin regulation is found to reduce organism escape probabilities significantly. Thus, our advice to future
                    teams is to incorporate redundant toxin regulation. We collected all kill switches ever implemented in iGEM in an online database.
                    Our tool can be used by future iGEM teams to study their or already existing kill switch designs. Our
                    <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Marburg/Collaborations">collaboration</A> deals with the experimental evidence of our theoretical predictions.

                The fact that Synthetic Biology not only opens doors to a new era of science but also threatens humankind and the ecosystem
                we live in is widely known. The impact of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in nature can not be foreseen and are practically
                irreversible once having been in contact with nature.
            </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12 text-justify"><P>
                Genetic constructs that kill GMOs on purpose once they escaped the lab environment unintentionally are a great way to reduce the
                threat through these organisms <A class="ref" href="#ref_1">[1]</A>. These constructs are called kill switches in analogy to their industrial equivalent (figure 1).
                It might be implemented into an otherwise already genetically modified organism. Once the organism escapes the lab, it will die. This
                way, it cannot harm the environment and applications of Synthetic Biology like our artificial endosymbiosis can be scaled safely
                to industrial level.
            </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12"><DIV class="figure_text"><B>Figure 1. The kill switch analogy in industrial applications.</B> It is pressed once an emergency happens so

                However, one has to keep in mind that all organisms underlie natural occurring mutations. Therefore, the kill switch might be destroyed
                through mutations while the organism is under lab conditions. Subsequently, this problem causes that the GMO might threatens nature due
                to its survival after an accidental escape.
            </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12 text-justify"><P>
                A kill switch is a genetic regulatory network. Such a network is built from biological components such as promoters and genes which
                are interlinked with each other. The network’s structure – also called its topology – plays a crucial role for kill switches: Weakly
                design kill switch topologies are prone to destruction through mutations. Therefore, a GMO's safety classification depends on its kill
                switch topology. This raises the need for a tool to quantify a kill switch topology's robustness against mutation. Such a tool does not
                only provide help for a biologist designing a GMO on how to design a specific kill switch but it can be also used to derive general kill
                switch design guidelines.
            </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12 text-justify"><P>
                In the following, we will describe how the escape probability of a kill switch is computed. The escape probability is defined as the
                probability that a kill switch is destroyed due to mutations during lab conditions such that the organism survives in wild life
                conditions.

                Genetic regulatory networks (GRN) describe how genes are expressed inside an organism <A class="ref" href="#ref_2">[2]</A>. This is comprehensively summarized in wiring
                diagrams. Taking electrical circuits as comparison, the electrical current is equivalent to the flow of gene expression in GRNs. Genetic
                promoters represent nodes with different logical behaviors that lead to gene expression and therefore proteins being built. Subsequently,
                these proteins control promoters again such that complex behaviors arise.
            </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12 text-justify"><P>
                A common way to put this into a context so that quantitative statements are possible is to use  modeling of GRNs based on ordinary
                differential equations (ODEs) <A class="ref" href="#ref_3">[3]</A>.

                First, a vector of all involved substances is defined \[\vec{X}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\cdot\vec{e}_i\] with \(X_i\) being the concentration of
                the \(i\)th substance. Substances span from mRNA over proteins to intermediate complexes and finally the toxins. This vector \(\vec{X}\) depends
                on the granularity of the model and the precise biological processes (for instance dimerization, cooperativity or other higher order reactions).
            </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12 text-justify"><P>
                The time derivative of the vector \(\vec{X}\) is then formulated as a continuous function that might depend on the concentrations of
                all involved substances \[\frac{d}{dt}\vec{X}(t)=\vec{f}(\vec{X},t,k)\] where \(t\) is a given point in time and \(k=(k_i)_i\) encapsulates all
                constant parameters used in the time derivative. The constant parameters \(k_i\) are of very high relevance: They are used to describe
                the biological processes and determine if the mathematical model in return resembles the involved biology.

                The kill switch of BNU China’s iGEM team in 2014 <A class="ref" href="#ref_6">[6]</A> was chosen to be modeled. Topologically, it is a simple cascade of repressing units. We investigated

                dimerization and complex formations through higher order reactions. The network topology given by BNU China 2014 and our reworked topology based on a

                The inducer is IPTG and controls the toxin protein MazF. We introduce the dimerization of LacI and CI such that the dimers interact with the promoters.

                With these adaptations, the ODE system of BNU China’s iGEM team 2014 is a 10 dimensional vector that requires 23 constant parameters \(k\). The parameters

                While the previous kill switch consists of a serial cascade, another generic topology is two parallel cascades regulating the same toxin. These two
                cascades regulate the promoter in a OR gate manner: The toxin’s promoter is repressed if one inducer is present.

                Each cascade consists of the BNU China 2014 kill switch explained above. We take a step further from specific biological substances to abstract substances
                that behave like their biological equivalences: IPTG becomes I, lacI (LacI) becomes aa/ab (Aa/Ab), cI (CI) becomes ba/bb (Ba/Bb) and finally mazF (MazF)
                becomes c (C). This way, we focused on the topology of the kill switches. The topology can be found in figure 3.

                This topology is captured by a 19 dimensional concentration vector that requires 42 parameters \(k\). Since the overall mutation probability depends on the number
                of parameters, this kill switch is not comparable to the original BNU China 2014 kill switch. For that reason, we introduce a longer cascade in the following

                General genetic algorithms are a population-based meta-heuristic approach to optimize a complex target function <A class="ref" href="#ref_8">[8]</A>. The question at hand is in this
                case: Given a large input parameter space, how to choose a configuration that yields a maximal value in terms of a certain measure function.
            </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12 text-justify"><P>
                Genetic algorithms utilize the simulation of biological evolution. A specific configuration from the large input parameter space is called individual and
                its value in terms of the chosen measure function is defined as its fitness value. An individual has a representation that can be mutated to obtain a new
                individual with a different fitness. A set of \(N\) individuals is called a population of size \(N\).

                A population is simulated over the course of time for a number of generations \(g\). After each generation, evolutionary processes are applied. These comprise

                        a mutation occurs: One ODE parameter \(k_i\) from the set of all parameters \(k\) is chosen randomly. Subsequently, the mutated parameter is
                        computed by \(k_i'=mutate(k_i)\) with \(mutate\) modifying \(k_i\) in a way that is motivated by individual binding strengths of proteins on DNA.

                        Parental selection: The parents who replace the dead individuals are selected proportional to their fitness values <A class="ref" href="#ref_9">[9]</A>. The
                        individuals are assigned intervals between 0 and 1 proportional to their fitness. Subsequently, a random process will most
                        likely pick the fittest individuals but still does not hinder weaker individuals to be picked.

                        Transition to next time step: After the mutation process has been performed, taking the last time step’s concentrations \(\vec{X}(t_{i-1})\) and
                        time \(t_{i-1}\) as the initial value, the integration of the ODE system is performed. The integration is executed until a steady state
                        in all substances’ concentrations is reached: These concentrations are considered as \(\vec{X}(t_{i})\) in time step \(t_{i-1}\). This step is the
                        computationally most expensive one. Unit tests verify a successful integration routine.

                The algorithm takes various input parameters: The kill switch to simulate, the population size \(N\), the mutation rate per parameter \(\eta\) and the generations in
                incubation \(g\). The major result is the escape probability: The probability that an individual survives a release into wild life even though the kill switch should
                have killed it. Since mutations gradually change the kill switch’s parameters over the incubation time, the escape probability is a measure for how robust the
                kill switch’s topology is in terms of evolutionary stability.

                The computationally most expensive step is solving the differential equation for \(\vec{X}(t)\) for all substances and all \(N\) individuals at each time point. Each simulation
                is executed multiple times to obtain statistical relevance.

                The algorithm including all numerics has been implemented in Python <A class="ref" href="#ref_10">[10]</A> to run on multiple CPU cores in parallel. The systems of ODEs are generally not

                The tool we develop can be applied to arbitrary kill switches. In order to provide a good starting points for future iGEM teams
                to quantify kill switches with our tool, we created a database of all kill switches ever implemented in iGEM since 2004.

                This database comprises all the years and teams that implemented a kill switch. For each kill switch we summarized the used parts,
                toxins and their antagonists. In particular, the included pictures of the kill switch topologies will safe future teams a lot of

                We introduced further steps in the general genetic algorithm to adapt it to our needs. Not the individual with the highest fitness is computed but rather the
                escape probability of individuals after incubation time due to mutations. We accomplished this by using an integration of ODEs to update the population from
                one to another time step.

                The results section will present the simulated kill switches' dynamics, incubation time rescaling by the mutation rates and the evolutionary stability
                algorithm's findings in terms of escape probabilities. We provide general statements on how a kill switch topology should be designed for future
                constructs.
