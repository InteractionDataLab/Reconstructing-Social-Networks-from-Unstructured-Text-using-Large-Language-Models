Kill Switch Database
We already started to investigate the mechanisms behind different kill switch classes. Building on that we created a database for the whole scientific community to improve the search for reliable and stable kill switch designs. Together with the tool developed in our modeling section , we provide a great framework to improve safety of projects in Synthetic Biology.
The database includes all kill switches ever implemented in iGEM since 2004 delivering a pictured topology, part numbers, kill switch classes and links to the wiki on which the system was described. Figures 1 to 4 show navigation through our database.
This intuitively usable tool will help teams all around the world to implement these essential safety mechanisms in their projects in Synthetic Biology and biotechnological applications. Find the kill switch database here:
Kill Switch Database
The database is bundled in a ZIP archive and should be extracted from it. The folder "output" holds various folders and files. Opening the file "output/index.html" starts the browser and one can start browsing our database.
Figure 1. The kill switch database welcome page. Use the tabs to choose between                        the year-wise ordered kill switches and the used parts.
Figure 2. For 2014, the teams implementing kill switches are listed. Each record                        can be clicked to find the actual kill switches.
Figure 3. The database record of BNU China's iGEM team of 2014. A visual topology,                        the involved toxins, antagonists and parts are provided. A link to their documentation                        is given as well.
Figure 4. The tab showing all parts used among the implemented kill switches. The                        corresponding part numbers are provided.
