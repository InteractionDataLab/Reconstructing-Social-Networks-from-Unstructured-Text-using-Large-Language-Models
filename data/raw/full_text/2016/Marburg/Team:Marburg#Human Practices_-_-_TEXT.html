Human Practices
Usually an iGEM project mainly focuses on the lab work. We wanted to expand this view by                 investigating how our project might impact the economics of land grabbing by making                 use of the production of terpenoid-derived bioproducts. This resulted in a report, which outlines                 different aspects of land grabbing, such as population growth, prices for food commodities                 on a global scale, political and social influences and how an industrial-scale production of                 biofuels derived from artificial endosymbiosis could change either of these aspects towards a                 biobased production instead of land grabbing for resource generation.
In order to enable a scientific exchange between different iGEM teams, we also hosted the ‘iGEM meets Marburg’ meetup for the second time. Taking place in the beginning of august,                 we were able to welcome all German iGEM teams as well as the team from the SDU Denmark for an                 amazing weekend full of different activities and great discussions.
Because we also wanted to reach out to the general public, we had the opportunity to give several                 talks to different audiences, for example a group of American exchange students or during the junior                 GBM meeting in Marburg. Besides this, we were hosting the booth for Synmikro, the Institute for Synthetic                 Microbiology at the University of Marburg, at the Hessentag 2016, an annual fair of the state of                 Hesse. Here we had the possibility to reach out to a vast majority of society and discuss with them the                 goals, methods and possible threats of Synthetic Biology.

Hessentag. Synthetic Biology accessible for families.
We spread the idea of Synthetic Biology on the state fair of the state Hesse. Small                 experiments about Synthetic Biology suitable for the youngest and the oldest.
