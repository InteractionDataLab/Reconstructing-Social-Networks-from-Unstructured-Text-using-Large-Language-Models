Safety
In our project we want to establish a new production platform for biofuel production                 based on ‘artificial endosymbiosis’. We choose two of the most used and well established                 model organisms in genetic engineering: Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli.                 By following and extending the guidelines for responsible and safe research, we are able                 to ensure minimal risks to experimenter and environment. Here, you can find all important                 safety aspects we followed through the course of this summer. Additionally, we focused a                 whole side project on safety - we created a complete database of all kill switches ever                 designed within the iGEM competition and were able to model four of them in detail.
Lab Safety
Before starting our lab work, all students received a detailed safety instruction by covering                 all important aspects of working safely. This instruction was held by the safety officer of the                 Max Planck Institute for terrestrial microbiology Prof. Dr. Brandis-Heep, as well as Volker Vincon.                 A lab specific safety instruction was also given by our instructors. This covered for example:
proper behaviour in the lab, S1 safety measures and practices
documentation of experimental work
use of personal protective equipment
waste disposal of biological samples
chemical handling and hazards
accident prevention measures
fire safety regulations and emergency behaviour
Additionally, each student received an in depth training in every facility and for every instrument                  we had to work in or with (e.g. confocal microscope, FACS, HPLC) and was supervised during their measurements.
Project Safety
Since our project is meant to work as an industrial scale production, we wanted to keep safety                  issues as minimal as possible. Especially concerning our ‘endosymbiosis’ approach, we rejected                  several ideas for safety reasons. In the beginning of our project we wanted to use invasin and                  listeriolysin as an invasion method for our symbionts - this mechanism originates from Yersinia pestis and Yersinia tuberculosis and is part of their virulence factors,                  which makes them BSL3 and BSL2 organisms, respectively. Therefore, we choose a different and passive                  approach,  a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated fusion of vesicle enclosed microorganisms with                  yeast spheroplasts, which does not involve any pathogenic factors and therefore is harmless for                  humans and environment. During the lab work only BSL1 organisms have been handled, such as                  different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Escherichia coli.
Safety Regulations in Germany
In Germany there are several important laws and regulations that provide all information                  about the handling with chemicals and biological samples. The so called Gentechnikgesetz , a law regarding                  regulations in genetical engineering, covers all regulations we mentioned in the ‘Lab Safety’                  part. Additionally, there is the Biostoffverordnung ,                  which covers personal protection when working with biological samples and several chemicals.                  A detailed list of all organisms and their risk assessments can be found in the Organismenliste .
Kill Switches and Database
We think safety, especially concerning biocontainment, is an issue all                 of us need to assess. Instead of designing our own kill switch, we took advantage of the numerous                 kill switches already implemented in the iGEM database. We were creating a model describing their escape probability in terms of evolutionary stability understanding them as a genetic network.                 We did so in collaboration with the iGEM team of Lethbridge ,                 who performed experimental work in order to verify our model. In addition to the modeling of                 several kill switches, we included all kill switches ever mentioned in iGEM since its beginning in                 2004 in a database. This                 collection is available for download here .                 Hopefully this can help many teams to gain insight in already existing kill switches, their stability                 and how to improve the already available kill switches.
Safe Shipment
For the sending of our parts, we used the provided DNA Submission Kit and followed the instructions                 coming with it .
