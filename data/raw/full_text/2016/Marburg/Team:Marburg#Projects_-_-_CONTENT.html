                The term &quot;land grabbing&quot; describes the acquisition of land, mainly in developing
                and newly industrialized countries through foreign investors to plant crops for
                food production as well as for the production of valuable secondary plant substrates,
                for example pharmaceuticals or biofuels derived from terpenoids <A href="#ref_1" class="ref">[1]</A>.
                Although production of secondary plant substrates through microorganisms is possible in general,
                it is mostly either inefficient or extremely expensive in terms of research <A href="#ref_2" class="ref">[2]</A>.
                This is mainly due to the different properties of various microorganisms, where some are more
                suitable than others for the production of a desired substrate. In addition, this often
                goes beyond the utilization of traditional model organisms in microbiology, such as S.
                cerevisiae and E. coli. As mentioned before, it requires great effort in terms of engineering
                one of these organisms to make the production of especially these secondary plant substrates
                feasible.
            </P><P>
                To make this production through microorganisms more interesting and therefore solve the issue of
                land grabbing for this purpose, our project &quot;Syndustry – Fuse. Produce. Use&quot; combines the naturally
                given advantages of various model organism strains. For this, we created an artificial endosymbiosis
                between different organisms, mainly <I>S. cerevisiae</I> and <I>E. coli</I>. The organisms can be specialized to
                overcome bottlenecks for improvement of biotechnological productions or can even grant possibilities 
                for productions that have not been established to date. The process to make this possible can mainly be 
                divided into three parts: establishing a dependency between the organisms, implementation of a production
                pathway and the actual fusion of the organisms.
            </P><P>
                Since the biological safety of our system would be relevant to the recipients and the environment, we
                also investigated in the behaviour of certain bacterial safety mechanisms, the kill switches. Instead
                of designing one of our own, we took advantage of the numerous kill switches already implemented in the
                iGEM database. Using these, we were creating a model describing their escape rate in terms of evolutionary
                stability seeing them as a genetic network. We did so in collaboration with the iGEM team of Lethbridge,
                who performed to experimental work for verification of our model.
            </P><P>
                Due to the multiplicity of kill switches designed in the past years of iGEM, we also created a simple and
                easy overseeable database of all kill switches either described or implemented. It contains all relevant
                information for the selection of a suitable kill switch, for example a classification regarding the redundancy of crucial compounds, such as inducer and toxin or a topology map.

                In order to guarantee the fitness of  the host organism as well as the invading cell,

                the invading <I>E. coli</I> cell as the malonate source and a protein based dependency
                complementing essential gene knockout.

                Since our whole project relies on the utilization of the principles of endosymbiosis for production purposes, we had to decide for a method to bring the organisms together. This was accomplished by modification and optimization of a protocol using <I>polyethylene glycol</I> (PEG).
