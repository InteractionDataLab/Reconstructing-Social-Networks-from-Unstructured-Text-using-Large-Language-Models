The frist problem is that the encoding products of marker genes might be toxic and allergenic potentially for human or livestock. Antibiotic genes might be transferred into gut microbes’ genome of humans or animals, increasing the resistance of the microbes to the antibiotic. The other one is that marker genes could spread through pollens or other ways into other organisms, which is termed gene flow. In population genetics, gene flow (also known as gene migration) is the transfer of alleles or genes from one population to another, which may lead to unimaginable damage to the ecological environment.</DIV><P> </P><DIV class="p_font_size">In order to reduce the effects of pollen-mediated crop-to-crop transgene flow on environment, we use a technique called selectable marker-free system, so the final aSTARice is a marker-free transgenic plants(MFTPs). We design a <FONT style="font-style:italic">Cre-loxP</FONT> based side-direct recombinant system to knock out hygromycin phosphotransferase gene, minimizing the effect of the selectable maker gene.</DIV><P> </P><DIV class="p_font_size">To further reduce the unpredictable  threat of gene flow, we grow rice in pot culture and greenhouse-environment. What's more, we are also analyzing coding products by HPLC and trying to make sure that there is no harmful products in our rice.</DIV><DIV class="p_font_size">Because we are the first team who choose rice as a chassis, we have to assess the safety for rice. Rice is the self-pollinated plant so that the genotype in the individuals is pure and homogeneous. The probabilities that two flowers take place cross-pollinated is one percent, and the distance of the spread of rice pollen is close to one meter. Rice isn’t included in the white line, so we make a  checked-in on the official website.</DIV></DIV><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><DIV class="h2_font_size">Design for marker free</DIV><P> </P><P> </P><DIV class="p_font_size">In this part, we used a site-specific <FONT style="font-style:italic">Cre/loxP</FONT> recombination to delete the selective marker. To delete the selective resistance gene in transgenic rice, a marker-free element was used to assemble into four-gene multigene vector. This marker-free element was placed between two <FONT style="font-style:italic">loxP</FONT> sites, and consists of a HPT (hygromycin) resistance gene expression cassette and a <FONT style="font-style:italic">Cre</FONT> gene expression cassette controlled by anther-specific promoter (Figure 1). When <FONT style="font-style:italic">Cre</FONT> gene was expressed in transgenic rice anther, the Cre enzyme deleted the marker-free element between two <FONT style="font-style:italic">loxP</FONT> sites. <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:SCAU-China/Design#markerfree" text-decoration="underline">You can read more details, please click here! </A></DIV><P> </P><DIV class="p_font_size" style="margin-bottom:20px"><SMALL><FONT style="font-weight:bold">Figure 1</FONT>  The schematic diagram of the marker-free element. <FONT style="font-style:italic">PV4</FONT> is an anther-specific promoter that drives <FONT style="font-style:italic">Cre</FONT> gene expression in anther.</SMALL></DIV><P> </P><DIV class="h2_font_size">Laws &amp; regulations </DIV><P> </P><P> </P><DIV class="p_font_size">The credibility of the policy about “aSTARice” transgenic rice project:</DIV><P> </P><DIV class="p_font_size"><FONT style="font-weight:bold">The World Health Organization</FONT></DIV><P> </P><DIV class="p_font_size">In 2002, the World Health Organization claimed in&quot;20 questions about genetically modified food&quot;.
