During our experiments, we have collected some data and used educated guesses that are biologically feasible, trying to figure out: 1. which foreign gene is more important in the pathway; 2. the interaction between four foreign genes and other endogenous genes on expression level. Through these analyses, we wonder a better optimizing strategy to increase the production of astaxanthin in rice endosperm bioreactor.</DIV><DIV class="h2_font_size"><FONT style="font-weight:bold">1.

The expression of <EM>CrtI</EM> and <EM>BHY</EM> was significantly positively correlated with astaxanthin concentration in the rice endosperm bioreactor. The result suggests that the expression of <EM>CrtI</EM> and <EM>BHY</EM> are the rate-limiting factors to astaxanthin biosynthesis in rice endosperm bioreactor.

Foreign genes and endogenous genes</FONT></DIV><DIV class="p_font_size">To synthesize astaxanthin in rice endosperm bioreactor, we have transduced four foreign genes, thus, we want to know the interplay between foreign genes and endogenous genes, or will their expression influence each other. Especially, we focus on the genes' transcription network. The input signals usually change transcription factor activities on a sub-second timescale. Binding of the active transcription factor to its DNA sites often reaches equilibrium in seconds. Transcription and translation of the target gene takes minutes, and the accumulation of the protein can take minutes to hours.</DIV><DIV class="p_font_size">The production of the protein encoded by gene Y is balanced by two process, protein degradation (its specific destruction by specialized in the cell) and dilution (the reduction in concentration due to the increase of cell volume during growth).

We support that all the input signals appear at time t=0. Because we don't have enough time to measure transcription and translation rates of the genes, we assume that all the proteins have the same production rate and this rate are supported to be 200 nM/h. To measure the degradation rate of protein, αdeg, T1/2 is used in the following calculation, in which period of time the protein decrease by 50%. T1/2 of each protein is determined by their Instability index (II).
