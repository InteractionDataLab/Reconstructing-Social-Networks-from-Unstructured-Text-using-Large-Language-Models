Thus, help us to carry out experiments smoothly.</P><P>Weike Li  (Honor student):  Play a leading role in the very beginning of  our team-building process. Then, in the stage of brainstorming, not only help  to collect oceans of data and references for us greenhands, but also point out  the weakness of our idea and make suggestions. Finally, offer to improve the  experimental methods. All in all, he is an X-man who works with us but cannot  share success with us.(This is why we call him the honor student~)</P><P><STRONG>7.2Lab support</STRONG>
    State Key Laboratory for Conservation and  Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources:
    Our project mainly depends on Liu yaoguang  Laboratory which belong to State Key Laboratory for Conservation and  Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources.This laboratory is mainly engaged  in rice sterility molecular mechanisms and rice genetic engineering research.  It is at the leading level in gene carrier construction and plant tissue  culture.There is specialized field to grow genetically modified rice, and  have mature scheme of rice cultivation and management. The laboratory has  strict management in safety, including specialized processing of engineering  bacteria and plants、 safe distance between genetically modified rices and  isolate the  field from the outside  world.These methods make sure that our gm products won't cause pollution to the  environment.
    The lab provides us with great support.Including  the provision of reagent 、instrument、strains and field to grow rice.What is more important is that provide us  with technology to build a carrier and tissue culture system.</P></DIV><DIV class="img"><P>    </P><P>    </P></DIV><DIV><P><STRONG>(Human practice support)College support</STRONG>
    1.Teacher Jinhong Lai provides us with the pathway  to apply for the scientific research projects which can be supported by our  school and thus ensures our experiment budget.</P><P>2.Deputy secretary Dongmei He and Prof Letian Chen  raise all kinds of fund for our team so that our project can move on smoothly.</P><P>3.Thanks to the youth league committee in the  college of life sciences of SCAU, we can publicize some wonderful items related  to iGEM among the freshmen.</P><P>4.Also, with the help of the youth league  committee in the college of life sciences of SCAU, we can share a stall to  exhibit some achievements of our projects to the public during the “ZiJing  Festival” in our university.</P><P> </P><OL><LI>The Secretary Department of Youth League Committee of College of Life  Science organized the &quot;Laboratory Open Day&quot;, we took the chance to  show others about our own lab.</LI></OL><P>6.The Technical Department of Youth League  Committee of College of Life Science provided us the opportunity to display and  share our research work in the innovation and
