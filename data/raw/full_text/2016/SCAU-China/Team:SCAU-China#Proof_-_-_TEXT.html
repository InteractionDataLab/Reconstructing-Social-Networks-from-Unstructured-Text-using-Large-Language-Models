Analysis of transgenes
After Agrobacterium-mediated rice calli transformation, several hygromycin resistant rice lines were obtained, and their further molecular analysis were done. The genomic DNA of T0 transformants were extracted to do PCR amplifying HPT and Cre. Then PCR positive lines were selected to detect four foreign genes (PSY, CrtI, BHY and BKT). The PCR results of some lines showed the expected bands of four genes were detected (Figure 3).

To detect expression levels of these four foreign genes involved in astaxanthin biosynthesis, total RNA of transgenic rice seeds were extracted and their cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of DNase-treated RNA. The results of RT-PCR showed the expected bands of the four key genes for synthesizing astaxanthin in transgenic rice seeds (Figure 4).

These results of PCR and RT-PCR demonstrated that we successfully obtained transgenic rice with all of four stacking genes (PSY, CrtI, BHY and BKT).
 
In summary, we successfully obtained transformants with all of transgenes in lab and detected obvious transcriptional activity in endosperm. These results indicated that our designed pathway was realizable in rice endosperm. To further confirm astaxanthin production, several analysis were carried out. The results were shown in Demonstrate page .
