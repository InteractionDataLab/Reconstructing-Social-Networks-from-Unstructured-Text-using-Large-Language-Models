I’m Cammen Li, a Junior year student major in biotechnology .As the captain of the team, I has luxuriant imagination, and hope these ideas can be realized by ourselves with our own knowledge and ability.Beside biology, I am curious about all of the unknown in the world, and hope to explore them through practice.As the experimenter of the project, I’m crazy about scientific research, and often go back to dormitory before the door is going to be closed.I even want to work all night in the laboratory when I’m focus on the experiment .
Hello!My name is Tang Biyao,a,sophomore studying bioscience from SCAU(South China Agricultural University).I am responsible for the design of wiki and poster.I have extensive hobbies,for example,watching movies,listening music and reading books.What’s more,in my spare time,I am fond of ball games,such as basketball,badminton and table tennis,I am a one of basketball team in our college.I think I am a person who works hardly ,seriously and patiently.And I also like animals,especially dogs.
I’m Zou Shangjie,a sophomore student major in biotechnology.Because of my lush legs,others usually call me “legs”.Firstly,I was an experimenter,but later I switched to human prectice team,mainly work on activity planning.I like the feeling of carrying out researching projects.At the same time,I am always desperate to show achievements on science research to the public.Except for biology,I am also crazy about doing research about  China’s recent history,geography,all kinds of outdoor sports and seafood.
I am Huang Junjie,and I’m a junior student finishing up my Bachelor’s degree in Biological Sciences.I join the team because I am interested in biology and want to make friends with those who are creative and love biology deeply. Except doing experiment in the laboratory,I also love playing soccer and touch rugby.
Zhang Runzhao, a sophpmore student in the college of Life Science. A  nerd with a flaming heart. An experimenter of iGEM-SCAU. Responsible for the transformation of rice. Now I’m committed myself to make life  science a cool thing. Is there anyone also interested in this subject?

Sharing and  collaboration are core values of iGEM, and our team also devote ourselves to  expanding the influence of synthetic biology with others. In this part, we have been help Guangdong Experimental High  School’ students to build a team (GDGDSYZX-United ) to participate in the iGEM  competition.
1.We helped them distribute of tasks to  everyone  according to their intention and talent,  such as experimenters, art designers,  editors and speakers.
2.We introduced  the purpose and overview of iGEM competition and explained  the rules to the them in detail.  Also, we showed some excellent wiki to let them know how to start their work and how to achieve their goal.
3.We showed  them how to use equipment to do experiment.  Since their chassis is plant cell, which is similar with us, so we could give  some guidance to their project. We also provide some plasmids  to them.
We lead them to  design their own logo and  team uniform. And we also send two teammates  (Wang Rong and Lin Yunping) to Guangdong Experimental High School for several months to be their art and modeling advisor to help them build web page and design poster .
We hold a meeting to communicate about project progress and team construction,  sharing experience and learn from each other.
Since the iGEMers  from team GDSYZX-United are all high school students, most of them know little  about mathematical tool which can help optimize biological experiments.So we  talk to them and try to make them to comprehen the usage of mathematical tool  in biological experiments by giving some examples of mathematical modeling in  iGEM projects. What’s more, we give them some advice when they are analyzing  the experiment results.
