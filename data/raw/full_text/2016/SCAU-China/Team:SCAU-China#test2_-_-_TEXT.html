I’m Cammen Li, a Junior year student major in biotechnology .As the captain of the team, I has luxuriant imagination, and hope these ideas can be realized by ourselves with our own knowledge and ability.Beside biology, I am curious about all of the unknown in the world, and hope to explore them through practice.As the experimenter of the project, I’m crazy about scientific research, and often go back to dormitory before the door is going to be closed.I even want to work all night in the laboratory when I’m focus on the experiment .
Hello!My name is Tang Biyao,a,sophomore studying bioscience from SCAU(South China Agricultural University).I am responsible for the design of wiki and poster.I have extensive hobbies,for example,watching movies,listening music and reading books.What’s more,in my spare time,I am fond of ball games,such as basketball,badminton and table tennis,I am a one of basketball team in our college.I think I am a person who works hardly ,seriously and patiently.And I also like animals,especially dogs.
I’m Zou Shangjie,a sophomore student major in biotechnology.Because of my lush legs,others usually call me “legs”.Firstly,I was an experimenter,but later I switched to human prectice team,mainly work on activity planning.I like the feeling of carrying out researching projects.At the same time,I am always desperate to show achievements on science research to the public.Except for biology,I am also crazy about doing research about  China’s recent history,geography,all kinds of outdoor sports and seafood.
I am Huang Junjie,and I’m a junior student finishing up my Bachelor’s degree in Biological Sciences.I join the team because I am interested in biology and want to make friends with those who are creative and love biology deeply. Except doing experiment in the laboratory,I also love playing soccer and touch rugby.
Zhang Runzhao, a sophpmore student in the college of Life Science. A  nerd with a flaming heart. An experimenter of iGEM-SCAU. Responsible for the transformation of rice. Now I’m committed myself to make life  science a cool thing. Is there anyone also interested in this subject?
Wangrong, a designer in our team. In this team ,I take charge of design the poster and wiki. My major is biotechnology. I like playing basketball,drawing and learning new things.  I f you have any question about our wiki or poster,you can send email to me.
Hello, I am one of the team member of IGEM-SCAU and my name is Joe Guo. In our team I am mainly in charge of building standard plasmid modul.

My name is Chen Junyu and I am a sophomore student majoring in bioscience. I am an introvert with few words and I enjoy the time I stay alone. When doing experiments, I feel calm and I would concentrate on the things I am working on. I favour in Japanese animation thus out-door activities do not attract me as the animation do to me. In my team, I am responsible for constructing standard basic part and testifying the antioxidation of astaxanthin.
My name is Xuecheng Li and I am a sophomore student who major in biology. In Chinese, my first name “xuecheng” means doing a good job in study. So my partner would like to call me ”the god of study” and I enjoy this nickname very much. I don’t have too many talents except daydreaming. In my team, I am responsible for some translation work and some human practice work. Finally, the most important of me——my lucky number is 7 and my favorite is “double seven”(77).
My name is Jianbang Lin. I’m a sophomore in College of Life Sciences. In this team, I am one of the member of wet-lab team.I am so glad to meet so many brilliant teammates. During this process,I have learned how to plan ahead and work efficiently in a scientific environment along side my teammates. I love iGEM because it is really cool getting to do really awesome lab work that I have never thought, and I can see what other people my age and university students around the world are doing.
My name is XinLu, I am a sophomore in college of life science, south China agricultural university. In the team of IGEM,at the early stage, I am a member of the group 2, I help read papers and wikis, we carry out brainstorming, looking for ideas together, I have come up with some ideas for our teams. During the early time, I try my best to solve every problem, and during this process, I acquire many knowledge of synthetic biology and my ability of reading paper and researching project are improved. I am responsible for the WeChat Public update the event planning and the personnel management.  If you got any question about me or the team, please contact with me. 409859596@qq.com
My name is Shuwen Chen and I am one of the teammates in SCAU-iGEM team.
