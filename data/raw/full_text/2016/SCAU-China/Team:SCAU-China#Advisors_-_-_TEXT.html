Jiamin Li
I am a senior student majoring in biotechnology. I am curious about the unknown world and try to explore them by my effort. As the captain of the SCAU-China team, I set up a new team consisting of 15 members in 2015. In the past two years, I have worked very hard with my team members to conceive an idea for iGEM project and fulfill the idea with experiments. I am very proud of that we have worked the project out with aSTARice, which is astathanxyn bioreactor using rice as chassis.
