Team SCAU-China set up in March, 2015. In the first three months, we actively come up with various thoughts in the meetings every twice a week, exchanging our idea with all the team members. Delightfully, we always got inspiration from other's sharing. After that, we divided our team into several small groups to work over several ideas, which were thought to be viable and meaningful. We dedicated to our issue and cooperated with other group members to complete them.
