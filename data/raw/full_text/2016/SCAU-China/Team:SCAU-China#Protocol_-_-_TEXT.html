Vector construction protocol
To construct the multigene vector for astaxanthin biosynthesis, we used a modified multigene vector system, TransGene Stacking II (TGSII) (Zhu et al., unpublished). This novel system is based on our previous studies on the transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC) and multigene assembly system (Liu et al., PNAS, 1999, 96: 6535-6540; Lin et al., PNAS, 2003, 100: 5962-5967). This system consists of a transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC)-based binary acceptor vector (pYLTAC380GW), together with two donor vectors (pYL322-d1/ pYL322-d2). By using the Cre/loxP recombination system and two pairs of mutant loxP sites, multiple rounds of gene assembly cycles were carried out with alternative use of the donor vectors, and multiple genes were sequentially delivered into the TAC vector (Zhu et al., unpublished).
To sequentially assemble them, the four endosperm-specific promoters drove four genes (CrtI, PSY, BKT and BHY) expression cassettes were constructed into two donor vectors, respectively. And these obtained donors, (Ⅰ) d1-CrtI, (Ⅱ) d2-PSY, (Ⅲ) d1-BKT and (Ⅳ) d2-BHY, were sequentially assembled into the 380GW acceptor by four rounds of gene assembly cycles, according to Ⅰ\Ⅱ\Ⅲ\Ⅳ order. Finally, after completing four-gene assembly, the marker-free element, containing a HPT selectable resistance gene expression cassette and a Cre-induced gene expression cassette by an anther-specific promoter, was integrated into the four-gene acceptor by Gateway BP reaction. The obtained six-gene marker-free multigene vector, named 380MF-BBPC, was transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 for further rice calli transformation.
Four genes assembly cycles:
Round Ⅰ: Cre/loxP reversible recombination of the d1-CrtI plasmid into the TAC-based acceptor plasmid pYLTAC380GW (i), followed by release of the d1 backbone by Cre-mediated irreversible recombination between one pair of mutant loxP sites (ii).The first CrtI gene expression cassette was assembled into the acceptor vector to form 380GW-C.
Round Ⅱ: Cre/loxP reversible recombination of the d2-PSY plasmid into the 380GW-C (iii), and release of the d2 backbone by Cre-mediated irreversible recombination between another pair of mutant loxP sites (iv). The second PSY gene expression cassette was assembled into the 380GW-C to form 380GW-PC.
Round Ⅲ: Similar to the first Round, the third BKT gene expression cassette from d1-BKT was assembled into 380GW-PC to obtain 380GW-BPC.
Round Ⅳ: Similar to the Round Ⅱ, the fourth BHY gene expression cassette from d2-BHY was assembled into380GW-BPC to obtain 380GW-BBPC.
Repeat above multigene assembly cycles, more genes can be easy to stack into the TAC binary vector.
Marker-free element integration
After four-round genes assembly, the Gateway BP reaction was used to integrate the marker-free element, containing a HPT selectable resistance gene expression cassette and a Cre-induced gene expression cassette driven by an anther-specific promoter, into the four-gene acceptor 380GW-BBPC. Finally, we obtained the marker-free multigene vector 380MF-BBPC for rice transformation.

Extraction and detection
1. The method of extracting the astaxanthin in rice endosperm
(1) Take 0.1 g rice seeds into mortar. After grinding it into powder on the ice, add 2 mL of methanol in mortar, and continue to grind for 5 minutes.
(2) Transfer the powder to a 2 mL centrifuge tube, spin at 10000 rpm for 10 min in the dark and low temperature condition to extract.
(3) Centrifuge at 8000rpm at 4 ℃ for 5 minutes and collect supernatant.
(4) Extract the sediment with methanol repeatedly, until the precipitation become white.
(5) Centrifuge again(8000rpm, 4 ℃, 5 min)and collect supernatant .
(6) Merge supernatant, concentrate supernatant into powder in the dark and low temperature conditions
(7) Add 600 µL methanol into dry astaxanthin extraction.
2. HPLC(High Performance Liquid Chromatography) determination of astaxanthin
After enrichment, put the samples into a 2 mL brown bottle through 0.22 µm syringe-driven filter, then detect the samples by HPLC. The mobile phase is methanol: water = 95:5. The flow rate is 1 mL/min. Column temperature is room temperature. The detection wavelength is 480 nm.
3. Standard curve for the determination of astaxanthin
Dissolve accurately 10 mg of standard sample of astaxanthin in 1 mL methylene chloride, and dilute with methanol to 100 mL in a brown volumetric flask and get the 0.1 mg/mL solution. Dilute the above-mentioned solution with methanol into 2 µg/mL, 4 µg/mL, 6 µg/mL, 8 µg/mL, 10 µg/mL. Take 20 µL sample to detect separately according to the conditions that mentioned above. With peak area as the ordinate, the concentration of the standard sample for horizontal, apply linear regression analysis, and get the regression equation.
4. Conclusion
The method of detecting the astaxanthin content in transgenic rice endosperm: grind transgenic rice seeds into powder on the ice, extract the sediment with methanol repeatedly, until the precipitation become white, concentrate the supernatant into powder, dissolved in methanol, use the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to measure the content of astaxanthin.
