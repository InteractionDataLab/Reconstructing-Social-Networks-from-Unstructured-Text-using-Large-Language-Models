Fig.1 Not I digestion of constructs cotaining different numbers of genes. Not I is the acceptor vector (pYLTAC380GW plasmid) and lanes 3-6 are intermediate products created during the construction of our delivering vecter,pYLTAC380MF-BBPC. Bands with arrows are the trangenes release from vector backbone and length of corresponding genes are indicated at the paretheses.

Fig.n HPLC analysis diagram of standard samples of astaxanthin(a); HPLC analysis diagram of  samples extract  from trangenes rice HG-380MF-BBPC (b);HPLC analysis diagram of  samples extract  from  HG-WT rice (c);
Compared with the standard samples with HPLC analysis diagram, you can see the sample extract  from rice and standard samples  have the same peak at the same time, show that the  transgenic rice seed which carry the four genes  expressed astaxanthin. Results indicate  that we are successful synthesize astaxanthin by rice endosperm synthetic .
