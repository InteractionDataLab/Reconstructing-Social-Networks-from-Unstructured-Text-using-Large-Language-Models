    State Key Laboratory for Conservation and  Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources:
    Our project mainly depends on Liu yaoguang  Laboratory which belong to State Key Laboratory for Conservation and  Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources.This laboratory is mainly engaged  in rice sterility molecular mechanisms and rice genetic engineering research.  It is at the leading level in gene carrier construction and plant tissue  culture.There is specialized field to grow genetically modified rice, and  have mature scheme of rice cultivation and management. The laboratory has  strict management in safety, including specialized processing of engineering  bacteria and plants、 safe distance between genetically modified rices and  isolate the  field from the outside  world.These methods make sure that our gm products won't cause pollution to the  environment.
    The lab provides us with great support.Including  the provision of reagent 、instrument、strains and field to grow rice.What is more important is that provide us  with technology to build a carrier and tissue culture system.</P></DIV><DIV class="img"><P>    </P><P>    </P></DIV><DIV><P><STRONG>(Human practice support)College support</STRONG>

      Sharing and  collaboration are core values of iGEM, and our team also devote ourselves to  expanding the influence of synthetic biology with others. In this part, we have been help Guangdong Experimental High  School’ students to build a team (GDGDSYZX-United ) to participate in the iGEM  competition.
1.We helped them distribute of tasks to  everyone  according to their intention and talent,  such as experimenters, art designers,  editors and speakers.
2.We introduced  the purpose and overview of iGEM competition and explained  the rules to the them in detail.  Also, we showed some excellent wiki to let them know how to start their work and how to achieve their goal.
3.We showed  them how to use equipment to do experiment.  Since their chassis is plant cell, which is similar with us, so we could give  some guidance to their project. We also provide some plasmids  to them.
We lead them to  design their own logo and  team uniform. And we also send two teammates  (Wang Rong and Lin Yunping) to Guangdong Experimental High School for several months to be their art and modeling advisor to help them build web page and design poster .
We hold a meeting to communicate about project progress and team construction,  sharing experience and learn from each other.
Since the iGEMers  from team GDSYZX-United are all high school students, most of them know little  about mathematical tool which can help optimize biological experiments.So we  talk to them and try to make them to comprehen the usage of mathematical tool  in biological experiments by giving some examples of mathematical modeling in  iGEM projects. What’s more, we give them some advice when they are analyzing  the experiment results.
