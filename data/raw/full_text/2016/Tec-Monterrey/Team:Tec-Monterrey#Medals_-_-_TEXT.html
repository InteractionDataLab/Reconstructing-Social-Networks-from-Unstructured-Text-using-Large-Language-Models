We registered for iGEM, had a great and amazing summer, and we are looking forward to attending the Giant Jamboree.
We met all the deliverables on time:
- We created this wiki for sharing with everyone our project.
- We have prepared a poster and a presentation for presenting at the Giant Jamboree.
- We submitted the Safety forms on time:
- Safety Check-in
- About Our Lab
- About Our Project
- Final Safety Form
- We submitted the Judging Form on time.
We have created a page with the attributions of each aspect of our project.
We documented and submitted a new part to the registry, which is a gold sensing device ( BBa_K2055000 ). In total, we have created the part pages of 14 new parts for iGEM registry.
We experimentally validated one of the parts ( BBa_K2055369 ) that was designed by us. We have documented the characterization of this part on its Main Page section. Also, we have submitted this part to the registry. For more information, you can also go to our results page.
We were able to collaborate with many iGEM teams all around the world. From exchanging information regarding normatives and laws to giving recommendations about biobricks design, we achieved to help other teams as well as being helped by others.
Our team has identified, investigated, and addressed issues like misinformation, indifference, sustainability and security relating to the e-waste pollution problem. We applied surveys to our community in order to investigate and assess the problem, we organized several events for creating consciousness about this issue and we also broadcasted informative radio spots to reach out to an ever bigger audience.

We organized our Human Practice in an integrated feedback system: we approached stakeholders and the general community with the purpose of obtaining and analyzing data to assess the severity of the problem. Then, we involved our community in different events aimed to create consciousness about e-waste pollution and the dreadful consequences of incorrect e-waste disposal. We also wanted to inform as much people as we could about the different ways in which they could participate and come up with solutions to help us improve our current situation. In addition, we also organized an e-waste collection campaign, where all the e-waste collected was given to a certified recycling company who accepted to provide us with the electronic scrap we would be using in our own experiments. Throughout this process, our experience allowed us to evaluate and reshape our project according to societyâ€™s needs. For more information, you can click here .
We were able to characterize 4 Biobrick Parts into a new chassis: backbone pSB1C3 , RFP coding device ( BBa_J04450 ), promoter LacI regulated ( BBa_R0010 ) and gold sensing device ( BBa_K1127008 ).
Because of the complex behavior of the projects we developed a mathematical model to compare it with the expected behavior of the systems. These simulations aligned with our initial hypothesis for HCN Synthase and TetH overproduction and helped us on deciding the initial conditions for the experiments.
Our team after the presentation at the Giant Jamboree, where we were indeed awarded a Gold medal. Thanks everyone!
