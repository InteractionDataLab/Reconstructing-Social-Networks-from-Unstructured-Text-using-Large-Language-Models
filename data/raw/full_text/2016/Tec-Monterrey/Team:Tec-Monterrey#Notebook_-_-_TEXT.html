We tested our antibiotics: ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol with our PLYS and Shuffle bacteria
We repeated the testing of our antibiotics and we add BL21 to the experiment.
Transformation (Shuffle calcium competent E.coli). The parts used were:  GFP [AMP] (11P from the 2014 IGEM kit plate #4), Promotor (17P from the 2015 IGEM kit plate #4). There was no growth at all (even in our control). Probably the heat shock wasn’t done correctly (1.20 seconds, 42°c instead 0.50 s) . We reactivated our strains Top10 and DH5-alpha.
We transferred our strains of bacteria to a new culture media LB.  We made some experiments to see if our CAM was working.
We made transformation  of the following strain: Top10 with GFP and also another one with DH5-Alpha with GFP.
The only strain that was transformed was Top10 with times 40 sec and 60 sec. We also made the solutions we needed for MiniPrep Solution I, II and III  that will be used in the rest of the project.  A digestion was also made with ECORI and Xbal.
An electroforesis gel was also made.
Digestion of the Minipreps of P1, P2, G2 and G4, using PstI and XbaI. Electrophoresis of both digestions and minipreps.
Electrophoresis of the minipreps. We used two different ladders: two-log and Axigen 100 bp. Purification of the gel with Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up System from Promega. We measured the concentration of our DNA in NanoDrop. Ligation. We made electrocompetent cells.
We tested our ligations transforming BL21 cells by heat shock. AMP, there was no growth in the petri dishes inoculated with them.
Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was obtained from the Geomicrobiology Laboratory of the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí, which was isolated from a mine in Durango, Mexico. The medium contained the following ingredients (g/L): 0.2 - ammonium sulfate, 0.5 - magnesium sulfate, 0.25 - calcium chloride, 3 - dipotassium hydrogen phosphate and 0.005 - iron sulfate. The agar medium was made with the same concentrations, only 12.5 g/L was added. Both mediums were adjusted to a pH of 4.0 and autoclaved at 121 Celsius for 15 min.
We did electroporation, DNA was prepared with the 2013 Igem kit Plate 5 “1G”, it contained pSB1A3 with Amp resistance. We used the strains of Top10, BL21, Shuffle and DH5-Alpha.  
We made calcium-competent cells of the strains Shuffle, BL21, Top10 and DH5-alpha. A first experiment was carried to evaluate the growth of A.Thiooxidans in liquid medium with elemental sulfur and sodium thiosulfate. Group 1 had 10 g/L of elemental sulfur, group 2 had 10 g/L of sodium thiosulfate and group 3 had 5 g/L of elemental sulfur + 5 g/L of sodium thiosulfate. The groups of the experiment consisted in: (1) Control medium without bacteria, (2) Control medium with bacteria without genetic modifications, (3) Bacteria with tetH overexpression. It was expected that the curve of the group 3 had the biggest slope value
In this day we made heat shock transformation with the calcium-competent cells of the previous day. The parts of iGEM that were chosen was
The result of the heat shock were analyzed. The antibiotics worked, there was no transformation and the C.C of BL21 were dead.
The strain of Top-10 was the only one that grow, so it was left to grow another night at 37 degrees C and 250rpm.  A miniprep was made of the Top10 Cam cells) and was left in the fridge so we could make electrophoresis another day.  A transformation was made of the strains BL21, DH5-Alpha and Top10 with RFP Coding Device and pSB1C3.
Digestion and Electrophoresis Gel was made. For the digestions we used XbaI and PstI. We used the latter “Quick- Load Purple 2-Log DNA Ladder.”
Two  minipreps was made of Top10 with culture media with CAM with RFP Coding Device.
Transformations were made with the calcium-competents  of the day July 21th. The DNA is a RFP coding device of the miniprep of July 26th.
Transformations were made again by heat-shock with the C.C of July 27th.
A transformation (heat-shock) was made with with the strains of July 21: Shuffle, BL21, DH5-Alpha and Top10.  Digestion were made using the miniprep of July 26.
Digestions were made of the miniprep of July 26h (0) and the minipreps of July 28th (1, 2).  EcoRI, PstI and XbaI were used. Afterwards, an electrophoresis gel was made with Diamond Dye and the Digestions.
A purification of gel was made thanks to a protocol that a collaborator gave us. Calcium-Competent cells were made of the strain DH5-Alpha. Later on, a transformation by heat-shock was made of the same C.C cells.
An inoculum of BL21 was left to grow to do in the following days electrocompetent cells.

An inoculum of Violaceum was left growing overnight. A transformation of E.coli was made by heat-shock using the iGEM kit parts of 2016 plate 1: 14F(GFP) and Plate 5 17N (Promoter)
An inoculum of Violaceum was left in petri-dishes  for it to grow at different dilutions: 1, 1:100, 1:1000. Also, an inoculum was left with Thiobacillus.Unfortunately three weeks after our first inoculum we lost our strain due to a failure in the pH measurements, when we tried to inoculate them again to fresh media cells would not grow. It was found that the pH of the original strain had come down to a pH of 0.63, thus all organic material was dissolved.
Dilutions of violaceum were made again in petri dishes. 8 petri dishes were made, 2 with AMP, 2 with KN, 2 with CAM and 2 controls one of each with a dilution of 1:1000 and another one complete.
A control of Thiooxidans was prepared to have a reference in Abs and solubility.  A transformation was made in the strain DH5-alpha by heat-shock. The DNA that was used was from the iGEM plate kit 2016 plate 1: 14F, plate 5:17N. the antibiotic that was used is chloramphenicol.

A miniprep was made out of the transformations that were made in August 16th.
A digestion  was made out of the miniprep of the previous day, with EcoRI and PstI. This digestion didn’t worked correctly because of the backbone and the DNA was almost the same size, so another digestion was made this time with a cut in the backbone with SaoI. Afterwards an electrophoresis gel was made. Also, a purification of the gel was made following the protocol of PureLink Quick Gel Extraction Kit.
Digestions and ligations were made. First the ligation of the backbone pSB1K3 with the iGEM part 14F Plate 1 2016 BBa_K577881.

A culture media for Thiooxidans was prepared.
A culture media LB was made with CuCL2 * 2H2O to see if Violaceum could become purple or to see if it could make copper precipitate. 4 solutions were made. A transformation was made with LuxI and DH5-alpha. LuxI= BBa_K805016, 19P.
