At first, we couldn't figure out how to approach a solution to all the issues we thought of, but with communication we found it in front of our noses: technology.</P><P>Our  multidisciplinary team consists of students from Biotechnology Engineering, Computer Science, Physics Engineering and Animation, all studying at ITESM, Campus Monterrey. We all have different views on biotechnology, from food industries to computational biology, each talent helping the team achieve its purpose in developing this project.</P><P>This team has come a long way since January where we first met up, shared ideas and started developing what is now our project. A year has passed where we saw each other every day for hours on end, including Friday nights, Saturdays, and Sundays. Through many complications we faced, tragedy brought us together, and we couldn't be any more grateful.</P><P>We are very thankfull to all the people that made this possible, welcome to our family. </P><H1 align="center"><STRONG>Team Members</STRONG></H1><P><STRONG>Leaders:</STRONG> Carolina and Alejandra, the girls that made our path possible along this year. Their leadership helped each one of us continue through fun times, but most importantly through rough days.</P><P><STRONG>Part designers:</STRONG> Jesus, Carolina, Raul, Carlos, Yili, and Suria were the minds behind the construction of the biobricks. </P><P><STRONG>Mathematical Model:</STRONG> Javier and Javier are the guys that developed the mathematical model of our modules for us to understand better the bacteria’s metabolism.</P><P><STRONG>Lab Work:</STRONG> Carolina, Alejandra, Yili, Jesus, Suria, Melissa G., Carlos, Raul, Carmen, Meli R., and Marcelo were the handy hands that made possible the results of this project.</P><P><STRONG>Human Practice:</STRONG> Carolina, Alejandra, Carmen, Yili, Raul, Suria, Carlos, Melissa G.,and Marcelo approached different communities to transmit  our project so people could see how science can be inside the little things of everyday life.</P><P><STRONG>Wiki:</STRONG> Carlos F. was the person responsible of making the wiki. He made the code and part of the design. Special thanks to Roberto for helping us too! </P><P><STRONG>Wiki Design:</STRONG> Jesus, Yili and Alejandra made a great effort in making part of the design of the wiki.
