Protocol 6. Digestion with Restriction Enzymes
Approximate time:
2 hrs
Material
PCR tubes
DNA sample
Restryction Enzymes (EcoRI, SpeI, PstI, XbaI)
NEB Enzyme buffer
Nuclease free dH2O
Equipment & Apparatus
Thermocycler
Previous steps
Measure the DNA concentration of the sample using the Nanodrop.
Calculate the required concentrations of the components depending on the DNA of the sample, and the reaction volume.
Ideally you must put 1 enzyme unit per each µg of DNA, yet the provider recommends using 10 times that quantity and adjust the volumes. Our most typical reaction was set up to be 20 µL.
Steps
Set and label your PCR tubes.
With the micropipette first pour the nuclease free dH2O.
Pour the NEB buffer 10X to get the 1X concentration.
Put the DNA sample next, this sample must be as clean as possible.
The enzymes must be put lastly, be careful to handle them because they are very temperature sensitive. (Handle with ice and return them to the fridge as soon as possible).
Set up the Thermocycler at 37º for 1h and inactivate the enzyme at 80º for 20 mins.
Analyze using agarose electrophoresis.

Previous steps
Digestion. Usually this protocol precedes the electrophoresis.
Prepare TAE stock solution (50X).
Steps
Prepare the gel
The amount of agarose depends on the size of the DNA.
Measure out the appropriate mass of agarose into a beaker with the appropriate volume of buffer. The volume in the lab gel box is 40mL.
Microwave until the agarose is fully melted and cool down a few minutes.
Pour the agarose solution into the taped gel box. Carefully pop or shove to the side any bubbles, put in the comb, and let it cool for about 30 minutes, until the gel is solid.
Load the gel
Mix the DNA samples with 5X loading dye solution to make it reach 1X. (Except for 1 µL of sample you can use 1µL of Loading dye).
Pour the mixture in the wells. Be careful with the bubbles and breaking the gel with the pipette.
Fill the chamber with TAE and run the gel 70 min at 90 V and ~180 mA
Stain and visualize the gel
Stain the gel soaking it in EtBr, be careful not to break it.
Reveal using the transiluminator, first focus using the white light lamp and use the UV to make the bands visible.

Incubate at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). Vortex the tube every 2–3 min to help dissolve gel.
Add 1 gel volume isopropanol to the sample and mix.
Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection and apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.
To wash, add 750 μl Buffer PE to QIAquick column, let the column stand 2–5 min after addition of Buffer PE and centrifuge for 1 min. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.
Centrifuge the QIAquick column in the provided 2 ml collection tube for 1 min to remove residual wash buffer.
Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 20 μl water to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min. For increased DNA concentration, let the column stand for 5 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min.
