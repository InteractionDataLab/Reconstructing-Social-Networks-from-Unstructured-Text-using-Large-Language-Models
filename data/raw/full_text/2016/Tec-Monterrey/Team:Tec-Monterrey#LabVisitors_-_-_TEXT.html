Visits of the general public in our lab
During our time working at the laboratory we received several visits from students of the faculty, high schoolers, professors and parents interested in our project. We explained our project, but we also talked about the severeness of the situation we are facing. We wanted to know their opinion and possible solutions they might have, but mainly, we wanted to create consciousness about this issue and promote the recycling culture, as well as the correct and responsible disposal of electronic waste.
In addition, we showed them the lab and described in a large scale what synthetic biology is and how we were applying it to solve the e-waste pollution issue. We also explained how our project could be implemented in several other areas, such as mining, and the benefits it could bring as a more environment-friendly alternative. With this, our aim was to show people all the possibilities synthetic biology has and how the different issues we are facing every day can be solved.
