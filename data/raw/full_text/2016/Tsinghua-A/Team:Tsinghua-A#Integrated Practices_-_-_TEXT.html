Community Communication
After hearing the community's concern about Biotechnology, we held two lectures to clear their prejudice. Meanwhile, we printed 80 booklets to expand publicity.
In China, the question about the safety of transgenic technology remains unknown. Though the question is really hard to confirm, many Chinese have stereotypes of biotechnology. We hosted two lectures about the correctness of Biotechnology, introducing the development Synthetic Biology, the stereotype phenomenon and the great biological applications that have been great contributions.
Then we printed 80 booklets which listed the argument on transgenic and the great biological applications.
What deserves to be mentioned is that most participants of our human practice is from College of Information Technology and we had a wonderful communication through the human practice. They asked us many questions and we also got some inspirations from them. What impressed us most is that a student from department of computer told us that the circuit switching and packet switching in computer network when transmitting information. We got a great inspiration from his words after we asked him for details about the two terms. Then we thought that circuit switching is that transmitting all information through a certain line but the packet switching is that dividing the information into pieces and transmitting different pieces through different lines. Both of the two methods have merits and demerits. Then we thought that why we could not combine both of them and then we designed our experiments that transmitting all information through two certain lines respectively in order to reduce the noises and uncertainty. And the experiments confirmed our views in some degree.
So you can see that we had a very successful human practice and we applied what we got from human practice into our experiments successfully. It helped with our project greatly and met the requirement of gold medal undoubtedly.
