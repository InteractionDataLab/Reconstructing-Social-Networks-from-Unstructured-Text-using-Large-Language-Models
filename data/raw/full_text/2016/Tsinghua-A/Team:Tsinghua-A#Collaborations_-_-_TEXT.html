Cooperation with other teams
With University of Science & Technology Beijing (USTB)
We cooperated with the iGEM team from University of Science & Technology Beijing (USTB) and we both learned a lot of thing from each other.
We often had friendly conversions through WeChat and told each other what our projects is about and how our projects is going. They told us that they had some trouble in assembling a plasmid they needed. They tried a lot of ways to assemble the plasmid but failed and they asked us for help. They sent us the photo of their unsuccessful plasmid and after some analyses we suggested them using a method called Gibson Assembly. They adopted our opinions and did some try again. Later, they told us that they had made it successfully and we were all glad to hear that.
We also invited them to our school and talked about our projects. We learned about that their project is about a kind of compound named notoginseng saponin. They told us about the process and purpose of their experiment in detail and we noticed that there are some cases they ignored. And also, we help them optimize the process of their experiment and gave them a hand on the analyzing of their result. At the same time, we invited them to our laboratory, showed them how our experiment goes on and also, gave them some advice on the operations they should take care of when they did their experiment. And they also gave us a lot of useful suggestions and all of us had a great and meaningful day!
With ShanghaiTech University
Computing Resource Support for Modeling
Simulating our system with Gillespie Algorithm, we fell short of computing power when it comes to scanning key parameters. ShanghaithchChina generously helped us out by running our code on their servers, which significantly boosted efficiency.
Illustrating Science
We illustrated ShanghaitechChina's project with cartoon, visualizing the process. The image is used in [where it is used]. When art encounters science...
