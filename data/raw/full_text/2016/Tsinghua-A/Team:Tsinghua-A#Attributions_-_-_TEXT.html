Instructors
We thank Xiaowo Wang and Zhen Xie, PIs in Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, for their tutoring and providing bench space for wet lab.
We thank Lei Wei and Weixi Liao, PHD students, for their support on experiment design and modeling.
Team training and Project start
The students in the Tsinghua-A team came up from different majors. We took courses together and had special training in synthetic biology and bioinformatics. All of the designs, constructs, models, human practices and experiments presented in Tsinghua-A’s Wiki were performed by students of the 2016 Tsinghua-A team. The instructors and teaching assistance were providing feedback and advice about the experiments and models. And they also give us lab support and help with the presentation coaching. We are proud of completing the project on ourselves.
Our instructors teach a synthetic biology course and we start the course in September, 2015. It is a pity that the syllabus and course materials are not freely available online but we are lucky to take the course since we have learned a lot of useful knowledge. We started our brainstorming in January, 2016 and we start our project and do our experiments in February, 2016. We are glad to have an opportunity to do a complete project by ourselves and we have fun doing it.
