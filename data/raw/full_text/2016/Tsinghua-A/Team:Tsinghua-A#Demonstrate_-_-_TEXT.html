In the figures are the FACS test results of our parts., which are EBFP2 without and with intein respectively. The EBFP-A signals tell us that the split florescent proteins could fuse together and emit florescent light.
Without Dox, constructs containing CMV show no florescent signal, which means that one single N- or C- terminal cannot light up. However, once the other half is induced, they bind and emit light.
This serves as an excellent reporter system. We can co-express EBFP2N:IntN and EBFP2C:IntC with target proteins A and B respectively. Only when both A and B are expressed, EBFP2 signal can be conveniently detected by flow cytometry or microscopy. If either A or B is not present, EBFP2 stays in darkness. Therefore, we can easily put our hands on the information about A and B’s expression states.
Although our program is a fundamental one and have no specific practical application in our minds beforehands, our work unexpectedly produces useful tool for genetic research. This is a footnote of the unpredictable and fascinating character of science.
