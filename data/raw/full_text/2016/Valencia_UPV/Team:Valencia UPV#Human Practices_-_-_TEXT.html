Human Practices
How society affects our project and how our project                         affects society? Those words got stuck in Valencia UPV                         team when we first read about human practices in iGEM.                         Science and innovation are nothing if it does not exist                         a relationship between them and people. We aimed to                         create a link not only between our project and society,                         but also between synthetic biology and people. Our team                         also made a deep study of how HYPE-IT and its usage can                         improve several factors in communities. In the                         following lines it is shown a summary of what we made                         for our human practices. If you want to deeply read                         about any of this points, you can access the pages                         through the navigation bar.
Social engagement
One of the first and most important issues for                         scientist nowadays is the rejection of society towards                         certain technologies. In the case of synthetic biology                         and genetic plant breeding techniques, this afraid is                         remarkable. But the important question is, why does                         this happen? We conducted a survey about plant breeding                         techniques, comparing CRISPR/Cas9 with transgenic and                         other traditional techniques. We concluded, as                         expected, that the problem relies on education and the                         lack of communication from scientific community towards                         non-expert people. For that reason, we decided to do                         our part and begin to spread the word of synthetic                         biology. We gave a workshop of genetic and synbio for                         children between 10 and 12 years old in the City of                         Arts and Science during the Summer School, with the                         slogan “Scientists of the Future”. The sooner they                         begin to understand how synbio works, the better they                         can analyze and evaluate by themselves its benefits and                         disadvantages. Our team did not forget about adults.                         Sometimes is it just necessary to explain in a relaxed                         and enjoyable way to change minds and convince people.                         We gave a talk in a pub in Valencia, participating in                         the initiative “Skepticals in the Pub”, about what is                         synbio and what can it do for us in the future.
Social                         engagement
Impact assessment
Our team was deeply interested on the real impact                         that our project could have on society at many                         different levels. The aim of HYPE-IT is to improve                         accessibility for plant genome editing with                         CRISPR/Cas9. But, why is this that important? Why do                         local plant breeders need to access the new plant                         breeding technologies? Why is important to make it easy                         for them? What happens if our product begins to be                         used?
We decided to make a study of the impact of our project                         on society, at the environmental, economic, social and                         nutritional level. To do this, we provide three                         scenarios where HYPE-IT could be beneficial to society.                         We identify at what extent does HYPE-IT improve those                         impacts and if it might have unexpected negative                         effects. This will allow us to re-shape our project                         accordingly.
To give more support to our purpose of improving                         accessibility for new plant breeding techniques, we                         made an economic viability analysis. This analysis will                         provide us from feedback of how our product should be                         sold to reach our purpose and at the same time being                         able to make it sustainable. With the aim to make this                         analysis realistic, we talked with the main                         stakeholders for our project: agricultural research                         centers, seedbeds and farmers.
Impact assessment
Safety
Finally, it is necessary to assess how our project                         might affect health and safety in society. Regarding                         plant genome editing, in the European Union there are                         serious legal issues, which have not yet been solved                         for CRISPR/Cas9 editing. It is unclear if EU will                         approve crops modified with this editing system: the                         success of HYPE-IT relies on this. A study of how our                         product might damage or improve the environment by its                         usage has been made, in order to know if additional                         safety measures need to be taken in account. The use of                         viral vectors might also be a concern of our project.                         However, several containment measures can be made to                         avoid risks.
