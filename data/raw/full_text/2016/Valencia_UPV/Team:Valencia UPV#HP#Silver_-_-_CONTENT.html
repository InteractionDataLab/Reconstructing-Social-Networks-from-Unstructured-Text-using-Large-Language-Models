                        development and exploitation of innovative
                        technologies. By taking in account people opinion, we
                        can obtain benefits for society in different issues
                        such as health or environment, allowing to introduce
                        science in a way that it can be more accepted.
                        For that reason, HYPE-IT project opts for mutual
                        communication between society and scientists. It is
                        utmost important for us to know how our project can be
                        leveraged by users and potential beneficiaries.
                        To gain further insight into general knowledge about
                        some plant breeding techniques such as genome editing,
                        transgenesis or genetic engineering, a survey has been
                        carried out. Our goal was to know if people knew the
                        difference between these plant breeding techniques, and
                        if they have or not solid reasons to be in favor or
                        against genome editing.
                        One hundred fifteen people between the ages of 16-68
                        were interviewed. Survey represents most of the levels
                        and fields of study (science, engineering, arts,
                        primary school, college, etc).
                        They were asked if they knew current plant breeding
                        techniques in order to reveal us the general society’s
                        knowledge about it. Afterwards, we wanted to know which
                        of these techniques they think that are currently being
                        used. In other words, how people think that crops are
                        improved to get higher nutritional quality fruits.
                        Figure 1 shows that hybridization - also known as
                        cross-species – and artificial selection – best plants
                        are selected – are the most known techniques. As it can
                        be checked, induced mutagenesis and polyploidy are the
                        least known techniques.</P><DIV style="text-align:center;"><P style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;font-size: 13px;"><B>Figure 1</B>. Plant breeding techniques known by
                            the surveyed.</P></DIV><P>
                        It is interesting to notice that only the 33.9% of
                        people consider that induced mutagenesis is normally
                        used. However, this is actually one of the most common
                        techniques for plant breeding, together with
                        hybridization and artificial selection. One of the main
                        conclusions that we can get from this analysis is that
                        genome editing techniques have the most significate
                        difference between what is known and what people think
                        it is used.
                        People were asked about which plant breeding technique
                        they think is the best and the worse from a
                        nutritional, health and economical point of view. As
                        seen in figure 2, the 44.3% chose artificial selection
                        followed by the 23.5% that think that genetic editing
                        is the best one. On the other hand, 68.7% consider that
                        induced mutagenesis is not the best option to improve
                        fruits’ quality. It is remarkable that only the 3.5% of
                        the interviewed chose the genetic editing as the worse
                        plant breeding technique. This is an encouraging
                        result, as it seems that plant editing is not seen as
                        bad as transgenics.</P><DIV style="text-align:center;"><P style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;font-size: 13px;"><B>Figure 2</B>. Opinion about the best and worst
                            plant breeding techniques, from a nutritional,

                        As we can see in the Figure 3, there are many people
                        who affirms to know about transgenic products. The
                        interesting point is that just half of them are aware
                        of the difference between transgenics and genome edited
                        plants. This fact means that this new technology has to
                        be diffused and communicated to society.
                        It is also noticeable how society claims about
                        preferring artificial selection over the other
                        techniques. 85% of people who voted against consuming
                        genome editing or transgenics said that they would
                        rather eat “natural products”. For most of this same
                        surveyed, induced mutagenesis was the worst technique
                        to be used for plant breeding. It is possible that they
                        do not know that it is a common technique. For that
                        reasons, our team found as necessary science
                        communication with society. It is important to know the
                        difference between what we eat and what we think we
                        eat.</P><DIV style="text-align:center;"><P style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;font-size: 13px;"><B>Figure 3</B>. Knowledge about what transgenics

                        If we scientists are able to explain why all plant
                        breeding techniques are equal on its outcomes, it is
                        possible that people will accept gene editing and
                        transgenics, allowing and even helping in a new and
                        necessary revolution of crops.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="Everychildisascientist_id"><H3>Every child is a scientist</H3><P>Kids are natural scientists. They have an enquiring
                        spirit. They are very curious and aren’t afraid to
                        admit that they do not know something. Exploring and
                        drawing conclusions from their experiences allow them
                        to build a more predictable world. That is why we think
                        that childhood is the suitable moment to impress them
                        the passion for research and knowledge. This way, it is
                        possible to start educating society to analyze and
                        interpret science, instead of rejecting innovation. If
                        they understand, they will have the ability to receive
                        change without fear.</P><P>
                        This summer, we have taken part of their adventure of
                        learning at the Summer School of the City of Arts and
                        Sciences from Valencia. They have been approached
                        biological aspects from cell biology such as molecular
                        genetics or the main biological processes –
                        replication, transcription and translation. But we
                        strongly believe that young children learn best through
                        doing, so apart from a brief introduction, we have
                        mainly focused on practical activities and games to
                        strengthen the concepts as much as possible. They have
                        had to adopt the role of the main enzymes such as
                        polymerases and ribosomes to carry out the processes of
                        transmission and expression of genetic heritage. To get
                        this, we have proposed some games like creating a
                        protein from a DNA sequence by adding amino acids,
                        writing their names nucleotides based on an imaginary
                        genetic code, or guessing the genetic similarities
                        between different species.
                        With all these games we also wanted to impress on
                        children the idea of what scientific investigation
                        involves. Real examples of proteins and experiments
                        were used to show that not everything works the first
                        time, even in real organism, mutations and other errors
                        occur. Furthermore, some experiments fall in a heap, so
                        they had to find out what went wrong, guess why, and
                        try again. And this is one of the main characteristics
                        of science, it involves a lot of debate, talking and
                        listening to others and meet group agreements and
                        conclusions.
                        Children have very enquiring minds, thus they are
                        always asking questions and wondering about what could
                        happen before they do something, creating hypothesis in
                        their minds. Those approaches are very interesting to
                        be stimulated since young, in order to face reality
                        with a critical thinking, but also to help people to
                        build their own ideas and convictions and refuse non
                        reliable statements.</P><P>
                        But of course, we did not forget that we are iGEMers,
                        so it was ineludible to talk with them about Synthetic
                        Biology and all benefits that this field can contribute
                        to society to make a better world. First of all, they
                        were enquired about their ideas of what Synthetic
                        Biology is, and we explained them the repercussion of
                        biotechnology research on society with some fascinating
                        examples. Nevertheless, we wanted them to catch the
                        motivation and desire for creativity, so we proposed
                        them to create their own organisms by using Synthetic
                        Biology principles and all their imagination.
                        It has been clearly an enrichment experience for both
                        children and us, which has provided us a different
                        point of perception of biological sciences and how to
                        face the problems with creative and innovative
                        solutions. We must maximize children’s potential,
                        because every child is a scientist.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="Itisnevertoolatetolearn_id"><H3>It is never too late to learn</H3><P>Fear of innovation comes from ignorance. We believe
                        that rejection of science advances as synthetic biology
                        or crop improvement happen because non-expert people
                        don’t know how these innovations works or what can they
                        do for us now and in the future. For that reason, we
                        decided to give a talk about synthetic biology. Its
                        title was &quot;Learning to program life&quot;.
                        The talk was given in a pub, as part of the initiative
                        “Skepticals in the Pub” in Valencia, were each Friday
                        people interested in the topic of the day reunite in a
                        pub to learn more about the subject. The relaxed
                        ambient and the dynamic talks serve as appeal for many
                        people to go to the pub and learn about science by
                        listening to experts in the field. Even if we are not
                        true experts, we thought that our team was prepared to
                        show how synthetic biology works and what impressive
                        things can be done with it.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="Press_id"><H3>Press</H3><P>One of our proudest publications about our project is our post in the PLoS Blog, where we could explain and present our project in a specialized blog.
