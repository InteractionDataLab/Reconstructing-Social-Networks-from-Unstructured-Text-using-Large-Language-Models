HYPE IT
Hack Your Plants Editing
Abstract
Covering food necessities is mandatory, but                     resources are not sustainably exploited. Global strategies                     to increase food productivity and quality need to be                     concealed with a local perspective, providing breeders with                     the necessary technology to improve varieties. The aim of                     HYPE-IT is to decrease current technological barriers for                     breeding local crops using precision genome engineering,                     easing the gene editing process using SynBio-inspired                     simplified CRISPR/Cas9 tools. HYPE-IT brings along a                     software tool that associates crop traits with specific                     gene targets and designs optimal gRNAs for those targets.                     HYPE-IT also incorporates a modular gene circuit that                     serves as an in vivo gRNA testing system, ensuring                     appropriate gRNA choice even when no precise sequence                     information of local varieties is available. We aim to                     develop a split-Cas9 system based on viral vectors to                     efficiently deliver the editing machinery into the plant,                     and to create an affordable Lab Ware with the necessary                     laboratory equipment for HYPE-IT.

gRNA Testing System
This system                             works as a genetic switch that produces light when the                             gene is knocked-out

Split Cas9
As a vehicle to genetically modify the plant,we decide to use a viral                             system to enhance plant infection.

Lab-Ware
Contains all the laboratory equipment and the                             necessary reagents required to perform genome                             editing, with simple protocols.
