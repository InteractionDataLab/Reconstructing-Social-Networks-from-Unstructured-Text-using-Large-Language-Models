DNA EB Extraction Buffer
100mM Tris pH 8
50ml of Tris HCl 1M
50mM EDTA pH 8
50 ml of EDTA 0.5M pH8
500 mM NaCl
14.63 g NaCl
Raise to 0.5 L
Raise to 0.5L
When it is going to be used, add b-mercaptoethanol to 10mM (10μL).
First phase
Weight 1g of tissue, freeze and grind with                             liquid nitrogen. Turn on water bath to 65°C
Add 15mL of extraction buffer (remember to add                             mercaptoethanol, 10μL) in a beckman tube.
Add 1mL of SDS 20%, shake vigorously and                             incubate 10 minutes at 65°C. Shake time to                             time.
Add 5mL of K-Ac 5M, shake vigorously and                             incubate 0°C during 20 minutes.
Centrifuge, JA20, 14krmp, 20 minutes.
Filter the supernatant through a nylon fabric                             of 30u and pass to clean beckman tubes.
Add 10mL of isopropanol, mix and incubate at                             -20°C during minimum 20 minutes. They can be left                             overnight.
Centrifuge, JA20, 10krmp, 15 minutes.
Pour and dry partially with the tubes inverted                             on blotting paper during 10 minutes. Warning:                             occasionally, the pellet may slide, so it is                             convenient to control the dry process.
Resuspend the pellet in 0.7mL of TE (Tris HCl                             50mM + EDTA 10mM). Put on Eppendorf tubes.                             Centrifuge 10 minutes at 7000rmp.
Transfer the supernatant to other Eppendorf.                             Add 75μL of Na-Ac 3M (approximately 1/10 of the                             volume) and 0.5mL of isopropanol (around 60% of                             volume). Mix well and centrifuge 2-3 minutes at                             10000rpm. If no pellet is produced, it will be a                             DNA concentration in the bottom; in this case, the                             supernatant should be removed with a pipette being                             extremely careful to not lose the DNA.
Wash the sediment once or twice with 70%                             ethanol (200-100 μL and centrifuge). Dry on                             speed-vac and resuspend in 0.1mL of mili-Q water.                             If with this amount of water it is not well                             dissolved, add more water each time. To dissolve it                             is left on ice, shaking from time to time, during                             approximately one hour.
Second phase
Add RNAase A up to 100 ug/L (add V/99 of the                             stock solution at 10mg/mL), digest at 37°C at least                             during 20 minutes.
Add 1 volume of phenol and invert during 1                             minute.
Add 1 volume of chloroform. Centrifuge 5                             minutes.
Transfer upper aqueous phase to other                             Eppendorf. Add NaCl 5M until 0.2M (V x 0.0416 of                             NaCl 5M)
Centrifuge 15 minutes. If centrifuged is not                             clear, add 100 ug of ethanol and then, centrifuge                             15 minutes.
Wash with ethanol 70%. Dry with speed-vac and                             dissolve in 0.1 ml of H2O milli-Q.

E.coli Transformation
Electroporation method was used in order to                             transform a DNA construction. This procedure is                             commonly used for E. coli and Agrobacterium.
The electroporation cuvette was put in                                     ice 10 minutes before inserting the cells.                                     An aliquot of electrocompetent cells are                                     taken out of the -80°C freezer, and they                                     are put immediately into ice.
1-2 ul of the ligation product are                                     taken and added carefully to them.
60 ul of the mix are taken and put into an electroporation cuvette making sure that                                     there are no bubbles.
The cuvette is dried and put in the                                     electroporator, making sure that any spark                                     is done. In that case, the process does not                                     work and must be repeated. This could                                     happen when plasmid and E. coli concentration are not optimal.
The voltage for the electroporator is                                     1500V for E. coli and 1440V for Agrobacterium.
Transformed cells are resuspended in                                     300 μL of LB in the electroporation                                     cuvette. Then, they are taken and put into                                     an Eppendorf letting them grow in the                                     shaker for 2 hours at 37°C.
Minipreps
In order to carry out all of necessary Miniprep                         -extraction of the plasmids out of E. coli -the                         protocol of the Omega kit (Plasmid DNA Mini Kit I Spin                         Protocol) is used. The steps to do it are:
Grow 1-5 mL culture overnight in a 10-20 mL                             culture tube.
Centrifuge at 10.000 x g for 1minute at room                             temperature. Decant or aspirate and discard the                             culture media.
Add 250 ul Solution I mixed with RNase A. Vortex or pipet up and down to mix thoroughly.                             Transfer suspension into a new 1.5mL                             microcentrifuge tube.
Add 250 ul Solutions II. Invert and gently                             rotate the tube several times to obtain a clear                             lysate. A 2-3 minute incubation may be necessary.                             Avoid vigorous mixing and do not exceed a 5 minute                             incubation.
Add 350 ul Solution III. Immediately invert                             several times until a flocculent white precipitate                             forms. Centrifuge at maximum speed (>13.000xg)                             for 10 minutes. A compact white pellet will form.                             Promptly proceed to the next step.
Insert a HiBind DNA Mini Column into a 2 mL                             Collection tube.
Transfer the cleared supernatant from Step 6                             CAREFULLY aspirating it into the HiBind DNA Mini                             Column. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.                             Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection                             tube.
Add 500 ul HBC Buffer diluted with                             isopropanol
Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.                             Discard the filtrate and reuse collection                             tube.
Add 700 ul DNA Wash Buffer diluted with                             ethanol. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.                             Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection                             tube.
Centrifuge the empty HiBind DNA Mini Column at maximum speed for 2 minutes to dry the column. This                             step is critical for removal of trace ethanol that                             may interfere with downstream applications.
Transfer the HiBind DNA Mini Column into a                             nuclease-free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50 ul Elution Buffer or sterile deionized                             water directly to the center of the column                             membrane.Let sit at room temperature for 1 minute.                             Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.
Store eluted DNA at -20°C.
Petri dish culture
Bacteria are transformed with a plasmid which gives                         them resistance to a specific antibiotic. Petri dishes                         must include this antibiotic to reject those bacteria                         that have not acquired the plasmid.
E. coli- pUPD2 plasmids: chloramphenicol.
E. coli- Alpha 1 and 2: kanamycin.
E. coli- Omega 1 and 2: streptomycin
Agrobacterium: rifampicin + the specific                             one for each construction.
To carry out this procedure is necessary to work in                         the laminar flux cabinet.
This procedure is necessary to made it in the laminar                         flux cabinet. After E. coli transformation,                         cells are put into an Eppendorf letting them grow at                         37°C. The spread plate method is done with 50-40 ul of                         this bacteria culture. To plate it is used aIt is used                         for plating a glass dipstick. After that, E.                         coli culture plates are put at 37°C for                         approximately 16h. Agrobacterium growth needs                         32h at 28°C.
Ligation reaction
The assembly of DNA fragments, commonly referred to                         as Golden Gate assembly, is an efficient technique                         where multiple inserts could be assembled into a vector                         backbone. The net result is the ordered and seamless                         assembly of DNA fragments in only one reaction. The                         ligations have a total volume of 10 μL so all of                         sequences that form part of the constructions are mixed                         up in an Eppendorf of 0.2mL.
This mix is put in a thermocycler with the programs GB                         (Golden Braid) or GG (Golden Gate).

Digestion Protocol
One or more restriction enzymes are used to digest                         the DNA, resulting in either non-directional or                         directional insertion into the compatible plasmid. DNA                         was obtained after doing athe Miniprep (Plasmid DNA                         Mini Kit I Spin Protocol). For carrying out the                         digestion to check if desired fragment is inside the                         plasmid it is necessary to mix up the followingnext                         components in a 200 ul Eppendorf.

These are the specific enzymes and buffers for each                         type of plasmid. The desired insert size for the clone                         library determines which enzymes are selected, as well                         as the digestion conditions. Generally, once the mix is                         done, it is necessary to incubate it at 37°C at least 1                         hour.

Agarose gel electrophoresis
Prepare Agarose gel
Agarose gel is used in a concentration of 1% to                             separate medium size fragments. The gel is made                             with agarose powder, TAE buffer 1X and ethidium                             bromide. It is necessary to adjust the amount of                             agarose to get the desired gel concentration. For                             example, with 1g of agarose / 100 mL of TAE 1X, the                             gel concentration will be 1%. The ethidium bromide                             concentration is 1:1000 in TAE Buffer (In the                             previous example, 1 μL is needed).                             Small gels where 10 samples can run need:
Reagent
Amount
Agarose powder
0.45 g

45 mL
Ethidium bromide
0.45 μL
Weight 0.45 g of agarose in a scale                                     precision.
Measure 45mL of TAE 1X. Add both of                                     them into an Erlenmeyer flask.
Put it in a microwave for 1-3 min                                     (until agarose is dissolved)
Let agarose cool down.
Add 0.45 μL of Ethidium bromide. This                                     step is optional and allows the                                     visualization of the DNA under UV                                     light.
Collocating agarose solution in the                                     correct tray. Do not forget putting the                                     electrophoresis comb. Pour slowly to avoid                                     bubbles due to they could damage the                                     gel.
Let it at room temperature for 20-30                                     minutes.
Running Agarose Gel:
When agarose gel is solidified, put it                                     into electrophoresis unit. It has to be                                     covered by 1X TAE buffer.
Load the molecular weight ladder. It                                     allows to check if our fragment belongs to                                     a specific band checking the size that it                                     has.
Load samples into the remaining wells.                                     It is recommendable to put 5 μL of DNA                                     sample with 1 μL of loading buffer.
Run the gel at 100V (Small gel) or 120V                                     (Big gel). The time varies depending on gel                                     concentration and voltage.
Visualize DNA fragments using a                                     transilluminator.

Luciferase assay
This procedure is done with the PrΩ kit                         (Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System)
Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens as a                         vehicle to insert the desired devise, it is necessary                         insert it into a leaf of N.benthamiana by a direct                         injection. This method is known as Agroinfiltration.                         The next step is letting infiltrated leafs for two or                         three days depending on how the experiment is                         programmed.
After two days post infiltration, users can get leaf                         disks from N.benthamiana using a hole punch. It is                         recommended to take the maximum agroinfiltrated area                         avoiding plant nerves. Leaf discs are put in a specific                         plate depending on the light condition requirements.                         Different samples are taken during the next two days                         after discs were made and immediately they are put in                         liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.
The steps to follow are:
The Passive lysis buffer 1x is prepared. Each                             disk of leaf needs 200ul. The passive lysis buffer                             is stored at 5X so it must be diluted with                             distilled water. Place it on the ice besides the                             LUCII substrate and the STOP solution.
Cut off two little leaf disks of approximately                             0.8cm and put it into an Eppendorf tube.                             Immediately, freeze it with liquid nitrogen to                             avoid the deterioration of vegetal material.
Grind the freeze sample using the metabolomics                             robot. Put the samples on ice.
Add 150ul of passive lysis buffer 1x to each                             Eppendorf tube.
Vortex gently.
Centrifuge 13200rpm during 15 minutes at 4°C.                             While switch on the luminometer.
Dilute 2:3 the extracts on a new Eppendorf                             tube. Add 36ul of Passive lysis buffer 1x and 24ul                             of sample.
Take an optimal plate to use in the                             luminometer. Fill luminometer wells with 40 ul of                             LUCII which is stored at -20°C.
10 ul of sample is added in each well. Wait                             10minutes. During this time turn on and configure                             the luminometer.
Measure luciferase activity
Prepare 40 ul/well of Dual Glo 1x (STOP                             solution + substrate). The substrate is at 50x                             concentration and stored at -20°C.
When the first luciferase measure is done, it                             is necessary to add 40 ul of Dual Glo into each                             well. Let it rest during 10 minutes.
Measure the Renilla activity.
Take the obtained information and analyze                             it.
It must be kept in mind that the luminometer                         (machine to measure the luminescence) has to be ready                         before adding the reagents to the samples because it                         needs 10min to be ready. Set the timer (10min) with the                         first sample of luciferase and add the reactant to the                         other samples as quick as possible.
