Introduction
Feeding all population and doing it sustainably, is a                         major global issue. Biotechnology provides us with                         promising strategies to solve those challenges.                         However, agricultural necessities to efficiently manage                         crops industry, change under different geographical,                         social and other context-depending conditions. From a                         social perspective, living in a globalised world                         implies that one way or another, we are all connected.                         It is our responsibility to positively use those                         connexions.
In HYPE-it, we think that having solutions to problems                         affecting worldwide makes it mandatory to let these                         solutions arrive wherever they are asked. This is the                         reason why our aim is to improve accessibility to                         CRISPR/Cas9, delegating the improvement of crops to                         local institutions which are aware of their                         context-dependent circumstances and necessities.
Why do we study the impact assessments of our                         project on society?
Impact assessment is a process and analysis that makes                         possible to know the positive and negative consequences                         of a proposed project on society, economy and                         environment. The aim is to predict the impacts at an                         early stage in project design, allowing to reduce the                         found adverse impacts, shape the project to suit local                         environment, society and economy and take into account                         the opinions and preferences of relevant                         stakeholders.
HYPE-IT was created in order to overcome some problems                         that significantly make difficult the local                         accessibility of precision genetic engineering                         techniques, particularly CRISPR/Cas9. For us, there is                         a direct connection between society problems and                         project goals. We not only decided to choose this                         project to solve a real problem in society but we also                         made an impact assessment to fully understand the                         problems. This allows us to follow a strategy that will                         make our project to benefit society, economy and                         environment to the greatest extent.
Types of Impact assessment
Nutritional Impact Assessment
According to our purpose, it was mandatory to study the                         influence that a project has in a healthy and correct                         nutrition. Improvements should be translated in better                         data regarding child development, aging and incidence                         rates of diseases directly related to proper nutrition.                         Nevertheless, diet issues differ relying on the country                         or even between regions. This is the reason why it is                         important to identify nutritional necessities before                         analyzing the impact, as there is not a concrete global                         solution for all contexts.
Environmental Impact Assessment
Resources required and environmental consequences of a                         project are technical issues which determine its                         success. The goal is using natural resources in a safe                         and optimum manner, without compromising autochthonous                         flora, fauna and health of population. The                         identification, prediction and evaluation of                         environmental consequences linked to a project, must                         conceal environmental expertise, project stakeholders                         and other representative affected nucleus. Thus,                         analyzing the sustainability and acceptation of proper                         practices will condition the project viability, as both                         characteristics will delimit tasks execution.
Socioeconomic Impact Assessment
Activities performed because of a project, are expected                         to affect the economic and social context wherever they                         are located. The scale at which the economic study is                         carried through, can be from families to small and                         middle enterprises, or even to the national stock                         market. Microeconomy will play a role in the                         macroeconomics evolution, and vice versa, making it                         necessary to analyze both dimensions.
Three indicators widely used to evaluate this impact                         are:
Direct impact. It corresponds to the production                             (gross added product) and employment generated in                             those fields which are direct beneficiaries of the                             project.
Indirect impact. It involves providers of                             sectors who are direct beneficiaries of the                             project.
Induced impact. It is related to changes                             affecting the society as a collective, due to the                             new services and products offered.
Economic context affects health, education and                             expansion expectations of a society. The study of                             shifts induced in social trends, can help to                             reinforce or redesign the strategy and mission of a                             project, trying to contribute to individual and                             collective development.
Scenarios
In order to make a real analysis of how HYPE-IT could have impact in nutrition, environment and socio-economy, we set up four scenarios that represent real cases in which HYPE-IT can help to overcome a problem and provide an integral solution. These scenarios include recovering of crops in places with rough conditions (as plagues, drought, salt stress...), improvement of nutritional quality of foods, increasing productivity of crops and enhance of organoleptic properties. For each scenario we assess the three impacts previously explained.
1. Recovering crops
Powdery mildew (PM) is a fungal disease caused by a                         species of fungi in the order Erysiphales, that affects                         many crops such as cucumber, melon, apple, tomato or                         cereals. In Europe it is particularly problematic in                         grapevine, where the parasite covers the leafs and stem                         of the plant, resulting in damage of the plant and                         consequently a lower quality of the grape. It becomes                         acid and contains less anthocyanins and                         sugar.
In France, Spain, Italy and Germany, between 1992 and                         2003, 73% of the fungicides were used only for                         grapevine protection (1). These fungicides for treating                         powdery mildew are sulfur-based and can damage the                         environment. Genetically resistant varieties can be the                         solution for this problem. These varieties exist but                         are not accepted by consumers and producers, as the                         grape has a lower quality and are not the traditional                         varieties of the region. It has been found that                         resistance to PM can be achieved by knocking out genes                         residing in the loci MLO (Mildew Locus O) (2). Using                         the HYPE-IT technology, it is possible to easily knock                         out several genes in a grapevine variety which is                         affected by powdery mildew, without changing the                         characteristic of the variety.
Nutritional impact
Grapes and wine have a high content in polyphenols                         -including anthocyanins-, which have antioxidant                         properties. These compounds have positive effects in                         human health in the prevention of diseases as cancer,                         diabetes and atherosclerosis (3). Grapevines resistant                         to mildew would avoid losses of this highly valuable                         product, as well as preventing reduction of the                         anthocyanin content of the grape. This might reduce the                         price of grapes and wine, making more accessible for                         the consumers these healthy products.
Environmental impact
In 2003, around 60000 tons of sulfur-based fungicides                         were used, and most of it is applied on vineyards (1).                         Currently, powdery mildew is controlled using mainly                         these type of fungicide, which is dispersed into the                         environment. The fungicide used in vineyards can enter                         the soil surface and persist for a period of type,                         damaging the soil and the organisms living in it. It                         can also migrate due to leaching to groundwater our                         nearby waterways, contaminating water and being                         detrimental to aquatic life ( 4). If PM resistant                         varieties of grape are created, it will not be                         necessary the use of tons of fungicides that can damage                         the environment and the ecosystem. Other advantage of                         the use of HYPE-IT for grapevine improvement is the                         possibility to conserve biodiversity. It is not                         necessary for the farmer to change his variety to                         obtain resistance to PM, as he can improve his own                         local variety.
Socio-economic impact
Powdery mildew affecting grapevines can cost annually                         up to 369$/acre, accounting for loses and expenses in                         fungicides and its application over the crops. PM can                         imply around 20% of total grapevine production expenses                         (5). By using PM resistant varieties, these costs can                         be reduced, which means lower expenses for the farmer                         and consequently, cheaper products for the consumer. In                         2013, 14 million tons of wine were produced in the                         European Union, and it is the 3rd most produced                         processed crop. The same year, it exported 6 million                         tons (6). These indicators serve to illustrate the                         economic relevance of grapevine crops and the benefits                         that would bring resistance to one of its most                         prevalent diseases, powdery mildew.
2. Nutritional qualities improvement
Nowadays bad proteo-energetic nutrition is a huge                         concern in plethora of countries. The consumable items                         do not provide enough energetic and nutritional values                         required for a proper development. The consequences                         also affect the infants causing growth deceleration,                         energy diminution for activities, more difficulties for                         learning and even a lower resistance against                         infections. With HYPE-IT improved crops could provide a                         better hedge against the previous odds named. Food                         whose assimilation and processing in the organism will                         be the best possible, maximizing their nutritive                         properties and contributing to the improvement of life                         quality of the people.
As an example for a scenario where crop nutritional                         improvement is needed, we imagine a farmer from South                         America, for example Brazil. He wants to grow his own                         tomato variety (Solanum lycopersicum) but with an                         increased concentration of b-carotene and lycopene. The                         amount of cases of deficit in the intake of these two                         compounds is high in these regions.
The carotenoid biosynthesis pathway branches after the                         formation of lycopene. One important branch forms                         carotenoids such as b-carotene or violaxanthin. By                         reducing the expression of lycopene e-cyclase (e-CYC),                         carotenoid synthesis is up-regulated in seeds. The                         higher total carotenoid content resulting from                         reduction of this protein expression suggests that this                         gene is a rate-limiting step in the carotenoid                         biosynthesis pathway(7). Employing the user-friendly                         strategy of HYPE-IT this gene can be silenced by                         knocking it out in order to obtain the desired                         phenotype.
Nutritional impact
Carotenoids are essential for the organism as they are                         antioxidants that contribute to lower the risk of                         developing cardiovascular illnesses or some types of                         cancer. Additionally, b-carotenes are precursors of                         vitamin A, needed for a correct development of the                         organism. Vitamin A deficiency represents an important                         problem. It is calculated that 251 million children                         less than 5 years old have vitamin A deficit. In fact,                         an estimated 250 000 to 500 000 vitamin A-deficient children become blind every year, half of them dying                         within 12 months of losing their sight. (8) Moreover,                         between 1 and 2.5 million of deaths are related to                         enteric and respiratory diseases caused by this                         deficiency every year (9)(10)
Environmental impact
Improving quality of the tomatoes will require a higher                         demand, and consequently, the production. As a                         consequence of the overexploitation of the terrain, the                         farmer will need to increase the expenses in water,                         fertilizer, pesticides and other investments. The                         consumption of these natural resources causes                         environmental problems that need to be taken into                         consideration. Furthermore, carbon emissions due to                         fuel and energy expenses will be increased.
Socio-economic impact
A better tomato nutritional value will have a higher                         demand in the global market because the farmer will                         increase his yield, rising his income and possibly,                         creating new job positions. In a competitive market                         where fresh and healthy products are highly reckoned                         these tomatoes could make the difference and becomes an                         advantage for the seller and the consumer. Besides, the                         accessibility for this technology allows an increased                         food quality without being a big issue for the familiar                         economy.
3. Increasing productivity
In 2011, the world’s population reached seven billion                         people. By 2050, it will surpass nine billion, meaning                         that it will be necessary to produce 70% more food (                         11). One of the biggest problems regarding this issue                         is the low productivity of some crops. Crops that                         suffer from this problem need more resources, higher                         land extension and are prone to be more expensive,                         compared to High Yielding Varieties of the same                         crop.
High Yielding Varieties of maize, rice and wheat were                         developed in the 1960’s (12). These varieties had the                         common characteristic of being semi-dwarf. This meant                         that photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced,                         and the assimilates are redirected to grain production,                         increasing the yield of the crop. Later studies found                         that semi-dwarf varieties had a mutation in the pathway                         of gibberellin synthesis, making the plant shorter. In                         particular, semi-dwarf rice has a mutation in                         gibberellin-20-oxidase gene (Ga20ox) (13). With                         HYPE-IT, any rice variety which does not have the                         semi-dwarf phenotype can be edited to obtain the same                         crop with higher productivity.
This is the case of the well-known Bomba rice variety                         from Valencia, Spain. It is commonly used for paella,                         and its organoleptic properties make it very valuable                         for the consumers. However, this rice is expensive and                         needs large land extensions due to its low yielding.                         Bomba rice has a high stem, it lacks the semi-dwarf                         characteristic. Using HYPE-IT, the Ga20ox gene of this                         variety could be edited, obtaining a semi-dwarf rice                         that would maintain the same organoleptic properties                         with a higher production.
Nutritional impact
Rice provides 20% of the world’s dietary energy supply                         (14). It contains vitamins, minerals and a high                         carbohydrate content. Bomba rice is more appreciated                         due to its organoleptic properties acquired during                         cooking. There are many varieties of semi-dwarf rice                         crops which are cultivated around the world. Hence,                         this particular variety is not a necessity from the                         nutritional point of view.
Environmental impact
Higher Yielding Varieties have the advantage of                         producing higher amount of grain in the same land                         extension. The outcome is that less land extension is                         needed to feed the same amount of population. If higher                         yielding biotech crops had not been available from 1996                         to 2011 thanks to the Green Revolution, an additional                         108.7 million hectares of farmland would have been                         needed to maintain global production levels (15). Land                         extension is a very valuable resource for the                         environment. On the other hand, these varieties need                         more chemical fertilizers, that can damage the soil. As                         they are more efficient, up to three rounds of                         cultivation and harvest can be made, deteriorating                         micronutrient content of the soil.
Socio-economic impact
Bomba rice is very popular in Spain for its use in the                         famous dish paella. Nowadays, this variety is expensive                         compared to others, but it is still considered the rice                         that should be used to properly cook paella. The                         increase of productivity while using less land and                         water can lower its price and spread its use, allowing                         more population to enjoy its organoleptic properties.                         This turns out to be a benefit for the farmer and for                         the consumer, who can find a quality product at a lower                         price. Additionally, a higher production makes it                         possible to export traditional and local Valencia rice                         around the world, extending a cultural dish. As a                         negative consequence, it is possible that less                         employees are needed for the cultivation of a crop that                         consumes less land extension. This can be counteracted                         by the jobs that can be created as a result of the                         increasing production.
4. Organoleptic Properties Improvement
Organoleptic properties constitute the overall                         appearance of a product: smell, touch, flavor...                         Undoubtedly, a better appearance means higher consumer                         acceptance and a significant reduction of food loss and                         waste due to slower ripening, for example (16). A 2015                         report published by FAO estimated that a 40-50% of                         global fruit is yearly wasted or lost (17).
The following scenario is set in China, the major world                         fuzzy kiwi (Actinidia deliciosa) producer, with                         1.765.847 tons produced in 2013 ( 18). The gene                         encoding ACS3 is related to the harvesting of several                         fruits, including kiwis. Using HYPE-IT, they could                         easily find this information in our software and                         knockout the gene, slowing kiwi ripening.
Nutritional impact
Kiwi organoleptic properties are definitely worth to be                         improved. It is a well-known source of dietary fiber,                         vitamin E, K, C and carotenoids. Those are needed                         nutrients in some isolated places where foreign fruits                         cannot arrive because of their early harvesting during                         their transport. Improving their organoleptic                         properties could let their preservation until they                         reached those destinations. Kiwi seed oil is rich in                         α-linolenic and Ω-3 fatty acids. These unsaturated                         acids are helpful in the prevention of cardiovascular                         diseases, which have significantly increased in China                         during the last half century. The positive impact of                         those nutrients could be higher by the improvement of                         kiwi organoleptic properties, as it may incentivize its                         intake.
Environmental impact
In terms of production, a slower fruit ripening is a                         logistic priority. Concretely in China, the loss rate                         of fruit is a 20% and barriers imposed to outer food,                         compromising the fresh fruit transport. Although there                         may be strict control policy for an optimum layout,                         there is always a stock being produced. Fruit storage                         means additional expenses in the control of conditions                         that affect organoleptic properties, and in 2007,                         Chinese storage facilities only could accommodate the                         15% of production (19)(20). This makes especially                         difficult the maintenance of small and middle fruit                         enterprises, which cannot cope a scale in the                         production with the lack of conservation                         technology.
Storage costs could be much minor in case of modified                         kiwis with slower ripening, reducing the risk of losing                         product, augmenting the stock quality and the                         competitiveness of final product prices. From the                         consumer perspective, better organoleptic properties                         enrich the gastronomic experience, facilitating the                         intake of positive nutrients mentioned above.
Socio-economic impact
Closely related with logistic in production, the use of                         natural resources to reach the expected demand could                         benefit as well by slowing the harvest losses. A stock                         with good and lasting quality would lead to a decrease                         of the fruit amount to be newly produced. Reducing the                         water and soil used to grow fruit is key for                         environmentaly friendly strategies. In China, the                         availability of arable land is also a compromising fact                         due to the high urbanization and population increase.                         By slower fruit ripening, resources would be exploited                         in a more sustainable way, as a higher rate of the                         product could finally reach the market.
Nutrition is a big part of our life, the gear that                         allows us to achieve our personal goals every day. If                         we improve the characteristics of the food that                         provides that energy, we will increase our life                         quality.
