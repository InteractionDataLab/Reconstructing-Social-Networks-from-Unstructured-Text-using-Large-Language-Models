CRISPR technology has revolutionized biological                         science. Its potential and versatility are allowing                         scientists to carry out researches they had not ever                         dreamt before. Moreover, Synthetic Biology is starting                         to be instituted in plant science, for instance, the                         introduction of Phytobricks as a new iGEM standard. In                         this regard, we provided iGEM’s registry with                         Phytobricks standardized CRISPR related parts.
We provided with the necessary Phytobricks to use split                         Cas9 system in any desired plant, according to the                         phylosophy of our project. This strategy allows                         introducing Cas9 endonuclease through autoreplicative                         viral vectors of choice, which makes CRISPR/Cas9                         editing more efficient and personalized. Furthermore,                         we contributed with tools to determine gRNA efficiency                         in vivo with our testing system. In this respect, we add to the registry the standard and modular parts                         needed to build a genetic circuit to test any possible                         gRNA through luciferase assays.
Essentially, we contributed with a compilation of                         Phytobricks aiming to make plant genome editing with                         CRISPR/Cas9 easier and more straightforward.
Split-Cas9 parts
The parts created to deliver Cas9 into plants are                         based on split-Cas9. Both parts of the split-cas9 are                         in pUPD2, so they can be inserted in the adapted viral                         vector of choice, using Phytobricks overhangs.
The inteins used to fuse the Cas9 are the inteins of                         2014 Heidelberg Team ( BBa_K1362400 and BBa_K1362401 ). We have                         tested these parts in plant, with success.
BBa_K2017000 . C-split Cas9 + DnaE C-intein: half of the                                 SpCas9 protein fused to DnaE C-intein. The                                 active full-lenght spCas9 can be recovered by                                 using the other half of the protein, N-split                                 Cas9 + DnaE N-intein. Inteins are used to fuse both parts of the protein, as they interact and                                 splice, leaving the active protein.
BBa_K2017001 . N-split Cas9 + DnaE N-intein: half of the                                 SpCas9 protein fused to DnaE C-intein. The                                 active full-lenght spCas9 can be recovered by                                 using the other half of the protein, C-split                                 Cas9 + DnaE C-intein. Inteins are used to fuse                                 both parts of the protein, as they interact and                                 splice, leaving the active protein.
gRNA testing system parts
Our team has created a modular and standard system                         to test the efficiency of gRNA in vivo in                         plants. It includes all the parts needed to make the                         assembly of a testing system with the target chosen by                         the plant breeder.
BBa_K2017002 . 35s promoter + 5’ region: Promoter of                                 cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), used for                                 constitutive expression in plants. It is fused                                 with the 5’ region of the N. benthamiana polyubiquitin gene, which has a high expression                                 rate. It can enhance the expression of the                                 coding region.
Linkers
We use firefly luciferase protein as reporter in our                         testing system. It oxidates its substrate luciferin,                         emitting light during the process. It can act as a                         reporter protein when used with a promoter. This part                         is made to be fused downstream to other coding                         sequence, so it includes a linker in order to let the                         luciferase acquire the correct tertiary structure. We                         tested different linkers.
The luciferase does not include ATG (Met) to initiate                         translation, as it needs to be fused to other coding                         sequence on the 5’. The translation must begin in the                         coding sequence fused upstream. The linker includes a                         random nucleotide in 5’, to change the reading frame of                         the luciferase. That way, it will not be translated                         unless an indel is produced in the coding region to                         which the part is fused

BBa_K2017006 . RSIAT+TEV linker + Luciferase: luciferase with                                 the linker RSIAT+TEV.
Devices
We designed gRNA testing system devices to try two                         targets, Ga20ox of rice and TFL of Orange. This system                         aims to test the functionality and efficiency of a                         chosen gRNA to target a particular gene. This system is                         modular, as the gene inserted can be chosen by the user                         (TFL and Ga20ox, for example), only taking into account                         the required overhangs (5’-AATG-3’ and 5’-TTCG-3’).
The device includes a promoter 35s, 20 nucleotides of                         the Ga20ox or TFL gene, the reporter luciferase with                         SAGTI, RSIAT, AEK or RSIAT+TEV linker and the                         terminator Tnos.
Luciferase is out of its reading frame due to a                         nucleotide added upstream to the linker, and the                         initial ATG has been removed. This means that when the                         luciferase is translated, it will not be functional. To                         make it functional, it is necessary to make indels in                         the inserted gene fragment to put the luciferase in the                         correct reading frame. These indels can be made using                         the CRISPR/Cas9 system, which is the aim of this                         device.
