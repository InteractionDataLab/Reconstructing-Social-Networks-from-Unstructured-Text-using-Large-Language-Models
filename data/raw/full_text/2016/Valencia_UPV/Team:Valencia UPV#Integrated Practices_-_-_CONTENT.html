                        Feeding all population and doing it sustainably, is a
                        major global issue. Biotechnology provides us with
                        promising strategies to solve those challenges.
                        However, agricultural necessities to efficiently manage
                        crops industry, change under different geographical,
                        social and other context-depending conditions. From a
                        social perspective, living in a globalised world
                        implies that one way or another, we are all connected.
                        It is our responsibility to positively use those
                        connexions.
                        In HYPE-it, we think that having solutions to problems
                        affecting worldwide makes it mandatory to let these
                        solutions arrive wherever they are asked. This is the
                        reason why our aim is to improve accessibility to
                        CRISPR/Cas9, delegating the improvement of crops to
                        local institutions which are aware of their
                        context-dependent circumstances and necessities.</P><H4>Why do we study the impact assessments of our
                        project on society?</H4><P>Impact assessment is a process and analysis that makes
                        possible to know the positive and negative consequences
                        of a proposed project on society, economy and
                        environment. The aim is to predict the impacts at an
                        early stage in project design, allowing to reduce the
                        found adverse impacts, shape the project to suit local
                        environment, society and economy and take into account
                        the opinions and preferences of relevant
                        stakeholders.
                        
                        HYPE-IT was created in order to overcome some problems
                        that significantly make difficult the local
                        accessibility of precision genetic engineering
                        techniques, particularly CRISPR/Cas9. For us, there is
                        a direct connection between society problems and
                        project goals. We not only decided to choose this
                        project to solve a real problem in society but we also
                        made an impact assessment to fully understand the
                        problems. This allows us to follow a strategy that will
                        make our project to benefit society, economy and
                        environment to the greatest extent.

                        According to our purpose, it was mandatory to study the
                        influence that a project has in a healthy and correct
                        nutrition. Improvements should be translated in better
                        data regarding child development, aging and incidence
                        rates of diseases directly related to proper nutrition.
                        Nevertheless, diet issues differ relying on the country
                        or even between regions. This is the reason why it is
                        important to identify nutritional necessities before
                        analyzing the impact, as there is not a concrete global
                        solution for all contexts.</P><H4>Environmental Impact Assessment</H4><P>
                        Resources required and environmental consequences of a
                        project are technical issues which determine its
                        success. The goal is using natural resources in a safe
                        and optimum manner, without compromising autochthonous
                        flora, fauna and health of population. The
                        identification, prediction and evaluation of
                        environmental consequences linked to a project, must
                        conceal environmental expertise, project stakeholders
                        and other representative affected nucleus. Thus,
                        analyzing the sustainability and acceptation of proper
                        practices will condition the project viability, as both
                        characteristics will delimit tasks execution.</P><H4>Socioeconomic Impact Assessment</H4><P>
                        Activities performed because of a project, are expected
                        to affect the economic and social context wherever they
                        are located. The scale at which the economic study is
                        carried through, can be from families to small and
                        middle enterprises, or even to the national stock
                        market. Microeconomy will play a role in the
                        macroeconomics evolution, and vice versa, making it
                        necessary to analyze both dimensions.
                        Three indicators widely used to evaluate this impact
                        are:</P><UL><LI>Direct impact. It corresponds to the production
                            (gross added product) and employment generated in
                            those fields which are direct beneficiaries of the
                            project.</LI><LI>Indirect impact. It involves providers of
                            sectors who are direct beneficiaries of the
                            project.</LI><LI>Induced impact. It is related to changes
                            affecting the society as a collective, due to the
                            new services and products offered.</LI><LI>Economic context affects health, education and
                            expansion expectations of a society. The study of
                            shifts induced in social trends, can help to
                            reinforce or redesign the strategy and mission of a
                            project, trying to contribute to individual and
                            collective development.</LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="Scenarios_id"><H3>Scenarios</H3><P>In order to make a real analysis of how HYPE-IT could have impact in nutrition, environment and socio-economy, we set up four scenarios that represent real cases in which HYPE-IT can help to overcome a problem and provide an integral solution. These scenarios include recovering of crops in places with rough conditions (as plagues, drought, salt stress...), improvement of nutritional quality of foods, increasing productivity of crops and enhance of organoleptic properties. For each scenario we assess the three impacts previously explained.</P><H4>1. Recovering crops</H4><P>
                        Powdery mildew (PM) is a fungal disease caused by a
                        species of fungi in the order Erysiphales, that affects
                        many crops such as cucumber, melon, apple, tomato or
                        cereals. In Europe it is particularly problematic in
                        grapevine, where the parasite covers the leafs and stem
                        of the plant, resulting in damage of the plant and
                        consequently a lower quality of the grape. It becomes
                        acid and contains less anthocyanins and
                        sugar.</P><P>
                        In France, Spain, Italy and Germany, between 1992 and
                        2003, 73% of the fungicides were used only for
                        grapevine protection (1). These fungicides for treating
                        powdery mildew are sulfur-based and can damage the
                        environment. Genetically resistant varieties can be the
                        solution for this problem. These varieties exist but
                        are not accepted by consumers and producers, as the
                        grape has a lower quality and are not the traditional
                        varieties of the region. It has been found that
                        resistance to PM can be achieved by knocking out genes
                        residing in the loci MLO (Mildew Locus O) (2). Using
                        the HYPE-IT technology, it is possible to easily knock
                        out several genes in a grapevine variety which is
                        affected by powdery mildew, without changing the
                        characteristic of the variety.<B>Nutritional impact</B>
                        Grapes and wine have a high content in polyphenols
                        -including anthocyanins-, which have antioxidant
                        properties. These compounds have positive effects in
                        human health in the prevention of diseases as cancer,
                        diabetes and atherosclerosis (3). Grapevines resistant
                        to mildew would avoid losses of this highly valuable
                        product, as well as preventing reduction of the
                        anthocyanin content of the grape. This might reduce the
                        price of grapes and wine, making more accessible for
                        the consumers these healthy products.<B>Environmental impact</B>
                        In 2003, around 60000 tons of sulfur-based fungicides
                        were used, and most of it is applied on vineyards (1).
                        Currently, powdery mildew is controlled using mainly
                        these type of fungicide, which is dispersed into the
                        environment. The fungicide used in vineyards can enter
                        the soil surface and persist for a period of type,
                        damaging the soil and the organisms living in it. It
                        can also migrate due to leaching to groundwater our
                        nearby waterways, contaminating water and being
                        detrimental to aquatic life ( 4). If PM resistant
                        varieties of grape are created, it will not be
                        necessary the use of tons of fungicides that can damage
                        the environment and the ecosystem. Other advantage of
                        the use of HYPE-IT for grapevine improvement is the
                        possibility to conserve biodiversity. It is not
                        necessary for the farmer to change his variety to
                        obtain resistance to PM, as he can improve his own
                        local variety.<B>Socio-economic impact</B>
                        Powdery mildew affecting grapevines can cost annually
                        up to 369$/acre, accounting for loses and expenses in
                        fungicides and its application over the crops. PM can
                        imply around 20% of total grapevine production expenses
                        (5). By using PM resistant varieties, these costs can
                        be reduced, which means lower expenses for the farmer
                        and consequently, cheaper products for the consumer. In
                        2013, 14 million tons of wine were produced in the
                        European Union, and it is the 3rd most produced
                        processed crop. The same year, it exported 6 million
                        tons (6). These indicators serve to illustrate the
                        economic relevance of grapevine crops and the benefits
                        that would bring resistance to one of its most
                        prevalent diseases, powdery mildew.</P><H4>2. Nutritional qualities improvement</H4><P>
                        Nowadays bad proteo-energetic nutrition is a huge
                        concern in plethora of countries. The consumable items
                        do not provide enough energetic and nutritional values
                        required for a proper development. The consequences
                        also affect the infants causing growth deceleration,
                        energy diminution for activities, more difficulties for
                        learning and even a lower resistance against
                        infections. With HYPE-IT improved crops could provide a
                        better hedge against the previous odds named. Food
                        whose assimilation and processing in the organism will
                        be the best possible, maximizing their nutritive
                        properties and contributing to the improvement of life
                        quality of the people.
                        As an example for a scenario where crop nutritional
                        improvement is needed, we imagine a farmer from South
                        America, for example Brazil. He wants to grow his own
                        tomato variety (Solanum lycopersicum) but with an
                        increased concentration of b-carotene and lycopene. The
                        amount of cases of deficit in the intake of these two
                        compounds is high in these regions.
                        The carotenoid biosynthesis pathway branches after the
                        formation of lycopene. One important branch forms
                        carotenoids such as b-carotene or violaxanthin. By
                        reducing the expression of lycopene e-cyclase (e-CYC),
                        carotenoid synthesis is up-regulated in seeds. The
                        higher total carotenoid content resulting from
                        reduction of this protein expression suggests that this
                        gene is a rate-limiting step in the carotenoid

                        strategy of HYPE-IT this gene can be silenced by

                        phenotype.

                        Carotenoids are essential for the organism as they are
                        antioxidants that contribute to lower the risk of
                        developing cardiovascular illnesses or some types of
                        cancer. Additionally, b-carotenes are precursors of
                        vitamin A, needed for a correct development of the
                        organism. Vitamin A deficiency represents an important
                        problem. It is calculated that 251 million children
                        less than 5 years old have vitamin A deficit. In fact,
                        an estimated 250 000 to 500 000 vitamin A-deficient
                        children become blind every year, half of them dying
                        within 12 months of losing their sight. (8) Moreover,
                        between 1 and 2.5 million of deaths are related to
                        enteric and respiratory diseases caused by this
                        deficiency every year (9)(10)<B>Environmental impact</B>
                        Improving quality of the tomatoes will require a higher
                        demand, and consequently, the production. As a
                        consequence of the overexploitation of the terrain, the
                        farmer will need to increase the expenses in water,
                        fertilizer, pesticides and other investments. The
                        consumption of these natural resources causes
                        environmental problems that need to be taken into
                        consideration. Furthermore, carbon emissions due to
                        fuel and energy expenses will be increased.<B>Socio-economic impact</B>
                        A better tomato nutritional value will have a higher
                        demand in the global market because the farmer will
                        increase his yield, rising his income and possibly,
                        creating new job positions. In a competitive market
                        where fresh and healthy products are highly reckoned
                        these tomatoes could make the difference and becomes an
                        advantage for the seller and the consumer. Besides, the
                        accessibility for this technology allows an increased
                        food quality without being a big issue for the familiar
                        economy.</P><H4>3. Increasing productivity</H4><P>
                        In 2011, the world’s population reached seven billion
                        people. By 2050, it will surpass nine billion, meaning
                        that it will be necessary to produce 70% more food (
                        11). One of the biggest problems regarding this issue
                        is the low productivity of some crops. Crops that
                        suffer from this problem need more resources, higher
                        land extension and are prone to be more expensive,
                        compared to High Yielding Varieties of the same
                        crop.</P><P>
                        High Yielding Varieties of maize, rice and wheat were
                        developed in the 1960’s (12). These varieties had the
                        common characteristic of being semi-dwarf. This meant
                        that photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced,
                        and the assimilates are redirected to grain production,
                        increasing the yield of the crop. Later studies found
                        that semi-dwarf varieties had a mutation in the pathway
                        of gibberellin synthesis, making the plant shorter. In
                        particular, semi-dwarf rice has a mutation in
                        gibberellin-20-oxidase gene (Ga20ox) (13). With
                        HYPE-IT, any rice variety which does not have the
                        semi-dwarf phenotype can be edited to obtain the same
                        crop with higher productivity.
                        This is the case of the well-known Bomba rice variety
                        from Valencia, Spain. It is commonly used for paella,
                        and its organoleptic properties make it very valuable
                        for the consumers. However, this rice is expensive and
                        needs large land extensions due to its low yielding.
                        Bomba rice has a high stem, it lacks the semi-dwarf
                        characteristic. Using HYPE-IT, the Ga20ox gene of this
                        variety could be edited, obtaining a semi-dwarf rice
                        that would maintain the same organoleptic properties
                        with a higher production.<B>Nutritional impact</B>
                        Rice provides 20% of the world’s dietary energy supply
                        (14). It contains vitamins, minerals and a high
                        carbohydrate content. Bomba rice is more appreciated
                        due to its organoleptic properties acquired during
                        cooking. There are many varieties of semi-dwarf rice
                        crops which are cultivated around the world. Hence,
                        this particular variety is not a necessity from the
                        nutritional point of view.<B>Environmental impact</B>
                        Higher Yielding Varieties have the advantage of
                        producing higher amount of grain in the same land
                        extension. The outcome is that less land extension is
                        needed to feed the same amount of population. If higher
                        yielding biotech crops had not been available from 1996
                        to 2011 thanks to the Green Revolution, an additional
                        108.7 million hectares of farmland would have been
                        needed to maintain global production levels (15). Land
                        extension is a very valuable resource for the
                        environment. On the other hand, these varieties need
                        more chemical fertilizers, that can damage the soil. As
                        they are more efficient, up to three rounds of
                        cultivation and harvest can be made, deteriorating
                        micronutrient content of the soil.<B>Socio-economic impact</B>
                        Bomba rice is very popular in Spain for its use in the
                        famous dish paella. Nowadays, this variety is expensive
                        compared to others, but it is still considered the rice
                        that should be used to properly cook paella. The
                        increase of productivity while using less land and
                        water can lower its price and spread its use, allowing
                        more population to enjoy its organoleptic properties.
                        This turns out to be a benefit for the farmer and for
                        the consumer, who can find a quality product at a lower
                        price. Additionally, a higher production makes it
                        possible to export traditional and local Valencia rice
                        around the world, extending a cultural dish. As a
                        negative consequence, it is possible that less
                        employees are needed for the cultivation of a crop that
                        consumes less land extension. This can be counteracted
                        by the jobs that can be created as a result of the
                        increasing production.</P><H4>4. Organoleptic Properties Improvement</H4><P>
                        Organoleptic properties constitute the overall
                        appearance of a product: smell, touch, flavor...
                        Undoubtedly, a better appearance means higher consumer
                        acceptance and a significant reduction of food loss and
                        waste due to slower ripening, for example (16). A 2015
                        report published by FAO estimated that a 40-50% of
                        global fruit is yearly wasted or lost (17).
                        The following scenario is set in China, the major world
                        fuzzy kiwi (Actinidia deliciosa) producer, with
                        1.765.847 tons produced in 2013 ( 18). The gene
                        encoding ACS3 is related to the harvesting of several
                        fruits, including kiwis. Using HYPE-IT, they could
                        easily find this information in our software and
                        knockout the gene, slowing kiwi ripening.<B>Nutritional impact</B></P><P>
                        Kiwi organoleptic properties are definitely worth to be
                        improved. It is a well-known source of dietary fiber,
                        vitamin E, K, C and carotenoids. Those are needed
                        nutrients in some isolated places where foreign fruits
                        cannot arrive because of their early harvesting during
                        their transport. Improving their organoleptic
                        properties could let their preservation until they
                        reached those destinations. Kiwi seed oil is rich in
                        α-linolenic and Ω-3 fatty acids. These unsaturated
                        acids are helpful in the prevention of cardiovascular
                        diseases, which have significantly increased in China
                        during the last half century. The positive impact of
                        those nutrients could be higher by the improvement of
                        kiwi organoleptic properties, as it may incentivize its
                        intake.<B>Environmental impact</B>
                        In terms of production, a slower fruit ripening is a
                        logistic priority. Concretely in China, the loss rate
                        of fruit is a 20% and barriers imposed to outer food,
                        compromising the fresh fruit transport. Although there
                        may be strict control policy for an optimum layout,
                        there is always a stock being produced. Fruit storage
                        means additional expenses in the control of conditions
                        that affect organoleptic properties, and in 2007,
                        Chinese storage facilities only could accommodate the
                        15% of production (19)(20). This makes especially
                        difficult the maintenance of small and middle fruit
                        enterprises, which cannot cope a scale in the
                        production with the lack of conservation
                        technology.
                        Storage costs could be much minor in case of modified
                        kiwis with slower ripening, reducing the risk of losing
                        product, augmenting the stock quality and the
                        competitiveness of final product prices. From the
                        consumer perspective, better organoleptic properties
                        enrich the gastronomic experience, facilitating the
                        intake of positive nutrients mentioned above.<B>Socio-economic impact</B>
                        Closely related with logistic in production, the use of
                        natural resources to reach the expected demand could
                        benefit as well by slowing the harvest losses. A stock
                        with good and lasting quality would lead to a decrease
                        of the fruit amount to be newly produced. Reducing the
                        water and soil used to grow fruit is key for
                        environmentaly friendly strategies. In China, the
                        availability of arable land is also a compromising fact
                        due to the high urbanization and population increase.
                        By slower fruit ripening, resources would be exploited
                        in a more sustainable way, as a higher rate of the
                        product could finally reach the market.
                        Nutrition is a big part of our life, the gear that
                        allows us to achieve our personal goals every day. If
                        we improve the characteristics of the food that
                        provides that energy, we will increase our life
