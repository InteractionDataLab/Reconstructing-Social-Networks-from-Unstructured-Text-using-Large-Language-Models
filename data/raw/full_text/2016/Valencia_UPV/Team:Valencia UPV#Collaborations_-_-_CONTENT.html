                        researchers is to collaborate with other teams.
                        Collaborations provide benefits for both teams
                        involved: they can test their designs, know opinions,
                        obtain feedback, read about other projects, have other
                        points of viewâ€¦
                        In Valencia UPV team we believe that collaborations
                        with colleagues participating in iGEM or with companies
                        of the sector enrich our experience and allow us to
                        broaden our minds, at the same time that we help other
                        teams. That is the reason why we have been
                        collaborating with other iGEM teams at any chance we
                        had.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="Bettertogivethantoreceive_id"><H3>Better to give than to receive</H3><DIV style="width:100%;display:inline-flex;"><DIV style="width:50%;margin:1em 1em 1em 0;"><P class="imgFooterP" style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;">

                        plants, we sent them a device with 35s:GFP:Tnos, for
                        GFP expression in plants. We also advised them on the
                        use of Goldenbraid standard to work with
                        Phytobricks.</P><P><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Paris_Bettencourt">Paris
                        Bettencourt</A> team is working to remove stains with
                        microbes. One of their objectives is to remove wine
                        stains. As Spain is a country known by their wines,
                        they asked us for samples of grapes, leaves and soil of
                        vineyards, so they could search for microorganisms that
                        could degrade wine stains. One of our team members
                        lives in the region Utiel-Requena, a wine with
                        Certification of Origin. The samples we sent them were
                        from this region.</P><P>
                       
                        We made a program that can be used to convert from
                        plain text to HTML. At the beginning, the program was
                        made for our own use (including classes particular for
                        our wiki). However, speaking with other teams, we
                        realized that it could be useful for others and we
                        adapted it so it could be used for any wiki working
                        with Bootstrap classes. You can try the program in this
