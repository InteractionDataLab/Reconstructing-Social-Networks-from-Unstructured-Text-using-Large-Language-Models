                        high cost of the laboratory equipment. To avoid this
                        problem the team Hype-it has designed a set of hardware
                        to make possible working with the technology
                        CRISPR/Cas9 for plant genome editing (and others) at a
                        low price (&lt;1000€). Approximately 7% of what usually
                        costs a set of the same hardware of commercial
                        brands.
                        For the design of this hardware the designing team has
                        worked with the wet lab team in order to have an
                        effective feedback and give the ideal solutions that
                        better fit the needs of the final user.
                        The designed hardware not only has proved to be
                        functional but also has been proved to be able to rival
                        professional laboratory equipment.

                        to keep the whole system safe. The lightness of the

                        For the joining of the profiles it has been used the

                        supply with security for short circuits.</P><P><B>Wire:</B> The power supply is connected to a wire of

                        The electroporator is a machine which applies an
                        electrical field to cells in order to increase the
                        permeability of the cell membrane. This is used to
                        transform bacteria by introducing new coding DNA,
                        plasmids.
                        It works by passing through 1500 volts across a special
                        cuvette, where electrocompetent bacteria are
                        introduced.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="FUNCTIONPRINCIPLE_id"><H3>FUNCTION PRINCIPLE</H3><P>
                        To produce the high voltage electrical pulse it is
                        necessary a high voltage power supply. The problem is
                        that this type of power supply does not have much
                        power, so it cannot be able to maintain constant the
                        voltage in the cuvette. One solution is the use of a
                        capacitor to accumulate the energy before doing the
                        electroporation. Hence, a MOSFET will be used to
                        control the duration of the pulse.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="OURRESULTS_id"><H3>OUR RESULTS</H3><P>
                        To test the low-cost electroporator, we transform
                        electrocompetent DH5α <I>E. coli</I> with a plasmid
                        with purple color (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K592009">BBa_K592009</A>).
                        One petri dish was cultured with bacteria transformed
                        with the low-cost electroporator (left), and the other
                        with bacteria transformed with a professional
                        electroporator as positive control (right).</P><P>
                        In the picture it can be seen that colony density is
                        higher with our low-cost electroporator, meaning that
                        the transformation was probably more efficient. This
                        suggests that the electroporator designed works better
                        than the professional electroporator we had in the
                        laboratory.
                        In order to repeat the experiment and test its
                        reproducibility, we did tried with two more different
                        plasmids. In the first we used a plasmid with dsRed.
                        The transformed cells should express a red protein. As
                        seen in the picture, bacteria were successfully
                        transformed.</P><P>
                        The second plasmid has GFP, so colonies should be green
                        under the fluorescence microscope. This third
                        experiment was also successful.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="KEYPARTSOFTHISMACHINE_id"><H3>KEY PARTS OF THIS MACHINE</H3><P><B>High voltage power supply:</B> this power supply
                        will provide the voltage needed to electroporate. It is
                        based in a DC-DC boost converter and the output voltage
                        can be adjusted between 300V to 1200V. Because the
                        normal voltage for electroporation is 1500V, we will
                        need two of this power supplies connected in
                        serie.</P><P><B>High voltage capacitor:</B> The capacitor will
                        accumulate the energy needed for electroporation. The
                        voltage rating of the capacitor should be greater than
                        1500V in order to provide a security margin. The value
                        of capacitance can be choosen between 1uF and 8uF, in
                        this range the capacitor will accumulate enough energy
                        and can be charged quickly. We selected a capacitor of
                        1600V and 1uF.</P><P><B>High voltage MOSFET:</B> The mosfet acts like a
                        switch in the circuit. When the mosfet is in the “off”
                        state, the high voltage source will charge the
                        capacitor. When the mosfet is in the “on” state, the
                        capacitor discharges through the load, producing a
                        negative pulse voltage. The voltage rating of the
                        mosfet selected is 1700V, and the nominal current is
                        4.9A.</P><P><B>MOSFET:</B> It is also needed a MOSFET to activate
                        and deactivate the high voltage power supply. The input
                        of the power supply is 12V, so we use a mosfet with a
                        55V and 41 A rating.</P><P><B>Cuvette Holder:</B> The cuvette needs to be
                        connected electrically to the electroporator circuit,
                        so a 3D printed cuvette holder has been designed. This
                        design includes a poka-yoke, so the cuvette will only
                        fit in the correct way. It also has two copper plates
                        to make contact with the electrodes of the
                        cuvette.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="ELECTRICALMODELOFTHECUVETTE_id"><H3>ELECTRICAL MODEL OF THE CUVETTE</H3><P>
                        The cuvette used in this machine is a 1 mm gap
                        electroporation cuvette. Electroporation cuvettes can
                        have different gap sizes. This size will determine the
                        voltage of the electroporation.
                        This type of cuvette, which contains two parallel plate
                        electrodes, can be modeled as a resistor and a
                        capacitor in parallel.
                        The value of the resistance can be calculated with the
                        next equation:</P><P>
                        Where l is the size of the gap between the plates,
                        sigma is the conductivity of the buffer solution and A
                        is the area of the electrodes.
                        The value of the capacitance can be calculated this
                        way:</P><P>
                        where e_o is the permittivity of free space (8.85 x
                        10°-12 F/m), e_r is the water dielectric constant, A is
                        the area of the electrode, and d is the gap distance
                        between electrodes.
                        The resistance has a typical value between 10 ohm and
                        15 koh. On the other hand, the capacitance is
                        independent of the medium conductivity and it is 35

                        The circuit that implements the electroporator is the
                        following one:</P><P>
                        Q1 is the high voltage mosfet, which will control the
                        charge and discharge of the capacitor C1. The mosfet Q1
                        is driven with one digital output of the arduino. When
                        Q1 is in “off” state the capacitor will charge through
                        the resistor R4. This resistor is used to limit the
                        current demand to the high voltage source.
                        The capacitor will take a few seconds to charge, so to
                        be sure that it is fully charged there is a tension
                        divider to measure the actual voltage in the capacitor.
                        This divider is implemented with two resistors R1 and
                        R2, that will reduce voltage of +1500 V to +3 V, so
                        this voltage can be read with an analog input of the
                        Arduino.
                        Then, when the capacitor is charged to the desired
                        voltage, the mosfet Q1 will change to “on” state so the
                        capacitor will discharge through the cuvette and the
                        mosfet Q1, producing a negative pulse across the
                        cuvette.
                        The high voltage source needs a +12V input to start
                        working, so a mosfet Q2 is used to control the on/off
                        state of the high voltage source. The mosfet Q2 is
                        controlled by the Arduino with one digital output. This
                        way, it is secure to discharge the capacitor.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="FUTURELINES_id"><H3>FUTURE LINES</H3><P>In the design we have proposed, the mosfet are
                        connected directly to the arduino. This will reduce the
                        lifetime of both the Arduino and the mosfet. So even
                        though the current design works, it will be good to
                        have a mosfet driver circuit in between the Arduino and
                        the mosfet.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="DOWNLOADS_id"><H3>DOWNLOADS</H3><P><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2016/5/58/T--Valencia_UPV--Electroporator.zip">

                        The light emitted from the laser goes across the sample
                        in the tube and is sensed by the photodiode in the

                        across as if there was any sample. The equation to
                        calculate the optical density is the following one:
                        OD = - (1/L)*log10(I/Io)
                        Where :

                        The result is that the lectures of the density meter
                        are virtually identical to the real values. For each

                        Generally, the purpose of a centrifuge is to separate
                        particles dense particles from low-density substances.
                        Working with bacteria, it is common its use for the
                        extraction of plasmids using special kits, that allow
                        the separation of the plasmidic DNA. This is achieved
                        thanks to a filter that is put in the sample tubes
                        which are centrifuged using specially prepared
                        solutions. The centrifuge is also used in genomic DNA
                        extraction from plant samples. The centrifuge has been
                        designed to reach 13,000 rpm, which is the maximum
                        speed needed for a plasmid extraction.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="FUNCTIONPRINCIPLE_id"><H3>FUNCTION PRINCIPLE</H3><P>
                        The centrifuge makes spin at high velocity objects,
                        then the centripetal acceleration will cause denser
                        substances and particles to move outward. In the other
                        hand, substances that are less denser will get
                        displaced to the center. The normal use in the
                        laboratory is to use sample tubes and the goal is to
                        separate substances by its density.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="OURRESULTS_id"><H3>OUR RESULTS</H3><P>
                        We tested the centrifuge and was able to reach speeds
                        of 13.000 rpm. In the following graph we show the
                        temporal response of the centrifuge by increasing the
                        control action every 10 seconds:</P><P>
                        The minimum control action is 1000 and the maximum is
                        2000. In this graphic we can see that with a control
                        action of 1250 we can get around 8000rpm.
                        We have done a control that manage to establish the
                        speed of the centrifuge to the desired speed.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="KEYPARTSOFTHISMACHINE_id"><H3>KEY PARTS OF THIS MACHINE</H3><P><B>Rotor:</B> The rotor is the part of the centrifuge
                        that will be connected to the motor and where the
                        sample tubes will fit. Rotors are normally expensive so
                        a 3D printed rotor has been designed. This design is
                        able to support the forces produced by the
                        spinning.</P><P><B>Motor brushless:</B> The centrifuge has to get high
                        speed and also needs high torque to be able to move the
                        rotor and the sample tubes. A DC brushless motor has
                        this two requirements, and it is also easy to set its
                        speed to a certain value, being very reliable. The
                        technical specifications for this motor are KV and A.
                        KV refers to the rpm constant of the motor - it is the
                        number of revolutions per minute that the motor turn
                        for each 1 volt supplied. A is the maximum current it
                        can demand. This value is directly related to the
                        torque it can produce. Motors with bigger KV tend to
                        have less torque. For the centrifuge a high KV will be
                        needed to reach the a high speed but it is also
                        important not to pick a huge KV value because the motor
                        will not be able to move the rotor. A KV above 1200
                        means that if you supply the motor with +12V you will
                        get a maximum of 14400 rpm. Finally, a value for A
                        around 25 works perfectly.</P><P><B>ESC(Electronic Control Speed):</B> The ESC will
                        control the power supplied to the brushless motor. This
                        way the speed will be controlled. It is important to
                        match the specifications of the ESC with the
                        specifications of the motor. The most important value
                        is that the max A of the ESC is bigger or at least
                        equal to the A of the motor. This way, the ESC will

                        they consist of an infrared emitter and an infrared
                        sensor. Every time the rotor spins the beam generated
                        by the emitter will be cut, producing a pulse in the
                        measure of the sensor. This way counting the number of
                        pulsed generated the rpm can be measured with high

                        Electrophoresis is a technique used to separate DNA
                        samples according to its length. It is used to separate
                        a desired DNA fragment or to check if a DNA sample is
                        the expected.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="FUNCTIONPRINCIPLE_id"><H3>FUNCTION PRINCIPLE</H3><P>
                        The DNA is placed in wells of the agarose gel. Then an
                        electrical field is applied. The DNA is affected by the
                        electrical field, and it will start moving through the
                        gel. Shorter DNA fragments will move faster than larger
                        DNA fragments, causing the separation of the DNA by its

                        parameter is the power, the current generated through
                        the gel is normally around 100 mA so with 25W it will

                        designed, including the comb and the gel mold. In
                        addition to the 3D cuvette some electronic parts are
                        also needed, but they are minimal: just two banana
                        connectors and two platinum cover wires. The platinum
                        cover wire is strictly necessary. Other type of wires

                        The controller is designed as a closed loop PID. Due to
                        the fitotron is a big space, the temperature control
                        gets difficult because all the response in temperature
                        are extremely slow. So we had to be extremely careful
                        in the tuning of the PID.
                        Finally we were able to control the temperature in the

                        This circuit realizes several functions: (1) actives

                        cells.
                        The fans always have to be on so they connected
                        directly to the power supply.
                        The sensor DHT11 is attached to a digital pin of the
                        Arduino.
                        The power of the peltiers is controlled by the mosfet

                        heat. The relay are driven by two mosfet.

                        The thermocycler is a machine commonly used to amplify
                        DNA, but it can be used as well in others reactions
                        affected by temperature.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="FUNCTIONPRINCIPLE_id"><H3>FUNCTION PRINCIPLE</H3><P>The thermocycler has a thermal block where reaction
                        tubes can be introduced in its pierced surface, and it
                        raises and lowers the temperature of the block
                        according to a preprogrammed temperature stages.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="OURRESULTS_id"><H3>OUR RESULTS</H3><P>
                        We did a test that consist in generating the
                        temperature cycles needed for a PCR. We obtained very
                        good results, we did manage to get the temperature
                        needed and also the time required. In the following
                        graph we can see the temperature cycles:</P><P>
                        However the PCR is a very sensitive process so although
                        we have accomplished the temperature and time
                        requirements we did not manage to make the PCR work.
                        This can be caused for multiple factors. The most
                        probable one is that the sensor we have is on the
                        aluminium block so the temperature we measure is
                        slightly different that the temperature inside the
                        reaction tubes. A difference of a few degrees is
                        crucial in a PCR, and can suppose the difference
                        between a working PCR and a non.working PCR.
                        We are currently working in a program to estimate the
                        temperature inside the reaction tubes.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="KEYPARTSOFTHISMACHINE_id"><H3>KEY PARTS OF THIS MACHINE</H3><P><B>Thermoblock:</B> The thermoblock is made from
                        aluminium plates. Aluminium was chosen due to its high
                        thermal conductivity and its low thermal inertia. Since
                        reaction tubes are meant to be placed here, it is
                        critical that the tubes make a good contact with the
                        thermoblock to prevent differences between the
                        temperature of the block and the tube.<B>Peltier cell:</B> The peltier will make the
                        temperature variations in the thermoblock. The peltier
                        is a electronical device able to produce heat or cold.
                        On one hand, the peltier is easy to install in the
                        thermoblock and has the ability of cooling. On the
                        other hand, this device consumes a significant amount
                        of power, so it will be necessary to have an electronic
                        power driver which is hard to design. A peltier of at
                        least 100W will be need in order to change the
                        temperature satisfying the specifications. We choose a
                        150W peltier cell in order to have a security margin in
                        the power specifications.</P><P><B>Heat sink:</B> In order to get more efficiency from
                        the peltier cell it will be needed a heat sink. The
                        heat sink will keep one of the faces of the peltier
                        cell to ambient temperature, this way the face that is
                        in contact with the thermoblock will get heated or
                        cooled easily. The heat sink is composed by a fan and
                        an aluminium sink.</P><P><B>Temperature sensor:</B> The temperature sensor will
                        be crucial. It has to have a low error, lower than 0.5
                        ºC, high precision, and also it need to have a fast
                        time response. We choosed the sensor LM35CA.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="CIRCUIT_id"><H3>CIRCUIT</H3><P>The circuit design realize three task: (1) lecture

                        peltier.</P><P>
                        In order to measure the temperature the sensor LM35CA
                        is attach to the analog input of the Arduino
                        There are two relay that will change the way is
                        connected the peltier cell. This way the peltier can be
                        power with positive and negative voltage. The arduino
                        does not have enough power to activate the relays so
                        two channel N mosfet are used to provide the power.
                        A channel N mosfet is used to generate a PWM to
                        regulate the power feeded to the peltier cell. This
                        mosfet is controlled by a digital arduino pin.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="CONTROL_id"><H3>CONTROL</H3><P>
                        A PID with a regulator has been design in order to
                        control the temperature.This is extremely robust and it
                        secure to get to the reference value of temperature in
                        a low time.
                        However the dynamic response was poorly due to the
                        influence of the ambient temperature. So an ambient
                        temperature pre-alimentation has been designed and it
                        has improve the dynamic response.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="FUTURELINES_id"><H3>FUTURE LINES</H3><P>
                        The most difficult part of this machine is the
                        thermoblock, it is hard to make it from aluminium
                        plates. So a improve will consist to do a 3D model and
                        then send it to fabricate in aluminium.
                        An other line,could consist in the improvement of the
                        peltier power what would lead to a better thermal
                        response, this will improve the efficiency of the

                        The luminometer is designed in order to allow the

                        very low power so a high sensitive sensor is needed. In

                        With the design we proposed the external light was

                        measure properly the bioluminescence generated.
                        We did a test with a positive control

                        sample, meaning that the sensor does not have enough
                        sensibility to differentiate them.
                        The are more expensive (more that 100€) sensors with
                        higher sensibility that will be able to measure the
                        bioluminescence.
                        However, in order to use the testing system is
                        necessary to measure three sample at the same time
                        -negative control, positive control and sample, that
                        mean it is need to have three sensors. So if we use the
                        expensive sensor will increase to much the final price
                        of the labware and that will affect negatively the
                        accessibility.
                        In conclusion we have tested different types of sensor
                        but it is necessary to research more in order to find a
                        sensor that is sensible enough and is low cost.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="KEYPARTSOFTHISMACHINE_id"><H3>KEY PARTS OF THIS MACHINE</H3><P><B>Structure:</B> the structure of the luminometer one
                        of the most important things. In this structure is
                        where the sample tubes and the sensor will be placed.
                        The structure has to be white in order to have a
                        greater sensibility, this way the light will reflect in
                        the inners walls of the structure so more light
                        intensity will reach the sensor. However, if all the
                        structure is white, external light will get across the
                        walls and will reach the sensor, producing
                        interferences in the signal measure. The solution is to
                        cover or paint the external walls.
                        We have designed a 3D model structure that will
                        accomplish all the specifications commented
                        before.</P><P><B>Sensor:</B> the sensor will measure the light
                        intensity It is strictly necessary that the sensor
                        works in wavelength from 300 to 600 nm. Moreover it
                        will be also recommended that the sensor only measure
                        in that wavelength, this way noise is reduced. We
                        tested several photodiodes, but anyone could measure
                        the bioluminescence properly. However the sensor
                        TSL235R-LF perform good in terms of noise and stability
                        in measures.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="CIRCUIT_id"><H3>CIRCUIT</H3><P>The circuit consist in the connection of the sensors
                        TSL235R-LF to the Arduino Mega.</P><P>
                        It is important that the sensor can only be attached to
                        digital pins of the arduino which are associated with a
                        interrupt line, because interruptions are needed in
                        order to read the output of the sensors. Pins 18 , 19
                        and 20 can do interruptions in Arduino Mega. But in
                        Arduino UNO only pins 2 and 3 can be used.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="FUTURELINES_id"><H3>FUTURE LINES</H3><P>
                        It is necessary to test different types of sensor in
                        order to find one that is sensitive enough and not
                        expensive. There exist a type of photodiode, the
                        photomultiplier. This type of sensor is high sensitive
                        and is the typical used for luminometers, however the
                        are quite expensive so the might not be the
                        solution.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item" id="DOWNLOADS_id"><H3>DOWNLOADS</H3><P><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2016/f/f5/T--Valencia_UPV--Luminometer.zip">
