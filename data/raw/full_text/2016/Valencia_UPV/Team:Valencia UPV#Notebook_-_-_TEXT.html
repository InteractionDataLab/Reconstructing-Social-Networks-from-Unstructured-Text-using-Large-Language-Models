Notebook
Valencia UPV team works with standard plant protocols and with the assembly system Goldenbraid, which works for assembly of Phytobricks. The protocols mentioned in the notebook can be found in the page "Protocols". We hope this page can help to follow or repeat our work easily, and that our protocols can help future teams working with plant synthetic biology or with simple bacteria experiments. Enjoy our journey through the work of our team!
Protocols
18May
Take glycerinated cultures of C58 Agrobacterium with dsRED from GoldenBraid Collection. Prepare broth                     culture (5 mL LB + 5 μL kanamycin + 5 μL Rifampin) 1:1000                     and incubate overnight at 28°C.
19May
Refresh previously made culture by inoculating 10 μL in                     a new culture medium.

Prepare liquid culture (3 mL LB + 3 μL antibiotic) 1:1000.                     Incubate at 37°C overnight.
Experiment with snails:
Two experiments: one with infiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana and another with                                 not infiltrated N.benthamiana (negative                                 control). Lettuce leafs haven’t been correctly                                 infiltrated and it seems that the expression                                 level is low.
Let both N. benthamiana leafs with                                 snails overnight at room temperature in                                 separated boxes. We will observe if snails eat                                 the leafs and if appears fluorescence.
15Jun
Experiment is over due to snails haven’t eaten leafs                     enough so we have not been able to see fluorescence.

Agroinfiltration procedure with 9 plants of N.benthamiana                     following the Agroinfiltration protocol.
01Aug
Pick up the samples of infiltrated plants. We keep 3                     disks per plant in a Eppendorf tube and we take 2 samples                     of each plant.
Luciferase assay is made following Protocol
.                     After analyzing all the data obtained, it seems that the                     system works but we must optimized it to increase the                     signal range. In this way, we will be able to distinguish                     signal from noise.
Conclusions luciferase assay:
Eliminate 5’ region of the device
Change linker sequence
Add renilla in luciferase assay
Change reporter to +1
Use pLess as control
Use a Wild Type as control
Insert devices in cis
Design a consensus target as longer as the                                 amplified.
