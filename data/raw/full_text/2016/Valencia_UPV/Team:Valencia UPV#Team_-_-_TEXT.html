Students
IVAN CASAS
I’m a Biotechnologist. This is my 2nd year as UPV_Valencia team member and I have been working on Plant SynBio for almost two years. Synthetic Biology is my passion and knowledge is my juice. The rest of team members think I know about a lot of different things. But the true is that I know nothing, just like Jon Snow.

MONICA GUTIERREZ
Also known as Niki, I'm a Biotechnologist currently studying a nanotechnology master, this is my 2nd year in iGEM. My passion is the engineering of biomolecules and living beings: that’s why Synthetic Biology has been a deeply interesting field for me. I am the team leader and community manager, so I have been working on almost everything!

MANUEL PORTOLES
ERS IT Advisory at Deloitte Spain, software developer and currently studying a Computer Science degree at Universidad Politécnica de Valencia. I really love Software Development, because it’s hugely collaborative and a very challenging profession. As part of Valencia UPV team I am responsible for software development, making me to be really involved in this project.

NOBEL SANTOS
Hello! I'm an electronical engineer especialized in control. Currently I'm studying an industrial automation master in the UPV. I entered in the world of biotecnology by chance, however I'm here to stay. The most important thing for me of the iGEM experience is the interesting people you can meet.

XAVIER MOLERO
Hello!  I study a master in industrial engineering.I’m quite interested in everything, and that is why I decided enroll again in iGEM (algo I like to suffer a bit)! The main goal was do something new and helpful to others.  Guys, I have an idea…Ok, nobody? I will do it…

Instructors
DIEGO ORZAEZ
He is Senior Researcher at Spanish Research Council and co-leader of the Plant Biotechnology Group at the Plant Molecular and Cell Biology Institute (IBMCP). Diego is interested in the design of innovative agricultural goods using synthetic biology tools. He learns how to re-direct the genetic program of the plants towards the synthesis of added-value products like fine chemicals or biopharmaceuticals.

ALBERTO CONEJERO
He received his Ph.D. from the Universitat Politècnica de València (Spain) in 2004, obtaining the outstanding dissertation award of this institution. Nowadays, he is associate professor at the School of Informatics - iSchool of this university and he is also researcher at the Instituto Universitario de Matemática Pura y Aplicada (IUMPA-UPV). His interests are the study of dynamical systems, chaos theory, mathematical modelling, and multidisciplinary applications of graph theory. He is also enthusiastic about the development of students soft skills.

JAVIER URCHUEGUIA
He is Full Professor of Applied Physics and works in Synthetic Biology since 2005 were he has taken part in different Spanish and European SB projects dealing with the subject of biofuel production by microorganisms. In his research he has contributed to develop in-silico models of cyanobacteria capable of producing ethanol and hydrogen amongst other fuels, working hand-in-hand with biologists and biotechnologists. Since 2006 Javier has participated as Instructor in IGEM, contributing to attract students to the field of SB in Valencia.

JESUS PICO
He is a control engineer fascinated by the world of systems and synthetic biology. Jesús Picó is Full Professor of Automatic Control at the Universitat Politècnica de València. He leads the group of Control of Complex Systems at the Institute for Automatic Control and Industrial Computing. His main interests are in modeling and feedback control of bioreactors, robust methods for estimation of metabolic fluxes and flux balance analysis, and nonlinear feedback control techniques applied to synthetic biological circuits. He has been instructor of the team since 2012

Paloma
She is a Biologist specialist in Biotechnology and recently has discovered the amazing world of synthetic biology. She is in charge of synthetic biology lab at Control of Complex Systems at the Institute for Automatic Control and Industrial Computing. Her current research is focused on providing experimental evidences in modeling and estimation of synthetic genetic circuits designed for control of cell population variability and control of intracellular metabolites.

Biologist
JOSE GADEA
He is Associate Professor at the Universidad Politécnica de Valencia and researcher at the Plant Molecular and Cell Biology Institute (IBMCP). His current research is directed at the molecular mechanisms that mediate resistance to stresses in plants, pursuing the gene that makes citrus plants resistant to canker disease or identifying genes that can make the seed live longer. He is teaching Genomics at the Biotechnology Degree at UPV, although his main interest is not what to teach but how to teach it.
