Surveys
One of the most important activities of professional                         researchers is to collaborate with other teams.                         Collaborations provide benefits for both teams                         involved: they can test their designs, know opinions,                         obtain feedback, read about other projects, have other                         points of viewâ€¦
In Valencia UPV team we believe that collaborations                         with colleagues participating in iGEM or with companies                         of the sector enrich our experience and allow us to                         broaden our minds, at the same time that we help other                         teams. That is the reason why we have been                         collaborating with other iGEM teams at any chance we                         had.
Better to give than to receive
35s:GFP:Tnos we sent to Georgia Team. They proudly showed the package         on Twitter!
The grapes and leaves we sent to Paris Bettencourt team from         Requena-Utiel region
Georgia                         State team needed a control for they                         transformations. As we both work with Phytobricks and                         plants, we sent them a device with 35s:GFP:Tnos, for                         GFP expression in plants. We also advised them on the                         use of Goldenbraid standard to work with                         Phytobricks.
Paris                         Bettencourt team is working to remove stains with                         microbes. One of their objectives is to remove wine                         stains. As Spain is a country known by their wines,                         they asked us for samples of grapes, leaves and soil of                         vineyards, so they could search for microorganisms that                         could degrade wine stains. One of our team members                         lives in the region Utiel-Requena, a wine with                         Certification of Origin. The samples we sent them were                         from this region.
We made a program that can be used to convert from                         plain text to HTML. At the beginning, the program was                         made for our own use (including classes particular for                         our wiki). However, speaking with other teams, we                         realized that it could be useful for others and we                         adapted it so it could be used for any wiki working                         with Bootstrap classes. You can try the program in this                         link: TXT to HTML
Cooperation
Spain iGEM Meetup: our team organized a iGEM Meetup                         with UPO-Sevilla and UPF-CRG_Barcelona .                         The                         weekend with both teams promoted communication and                         exchange of project ideas. The presentation sessions                         served as practice presenting our project to different                         people. And more importantly, we made friends!                         Afterwards the Meetup, we have kept contact with                         Barcelona and Sevilla teams, helping each other in any                         doubt related to iGEM, Jamboree and Wiki.
XMU-China :                         one year more, our team took part of the XMU-China newsletter In this newsletter teams get to know each other and can                         start a discussion of interesting topics on Synthetic                         Biology. It also allows teams to contact and start                         enriching collaborations.
Tianjin :                         they led a survey union with questions of each team                         (Team Pasteur, Team Pittsburgh, Team Virginia and Team NTU), so we could know opinions about our projects and                         synbio in general in different places in the world,                         having this way a more representative sector of                         population.
Aachen :                         in cooperation with iGEM teams in Mexico, Taiwan and                         Israel, led by Aachen, we performed a survey of general                         questions about genetic engineering. Like in the                         interlab study, the aim was to generate a higher amount                         of data from different countries and regions. This                         helped Aachen team in their human practices                         studies.
EPFL : this                         team created the site igem.today, were they published                         and wrote about interviews to other teams. Our team had                         a Skype interview with Laussane team, which was very                         well conducting and was enriching for both of us. We                         were proud to be featured on their page! Read here our interview.
Warwick :                         modeling collaborations are usually advantageous for                         both teams. Warwick is also working with CRISPR/Cas9                         system. They sent us their Matlab program to simulate                         different proteins in the same environment. We tried it                         to check how it simulated the Cas9 and the gRNA in the                         same environment, and compare it to our own                         simulations. Our team gave them our scoring system for                         gRNAs, so they could use it to choose the optimal gRNA                         for their protein regulation.
Surveys
Via Facebook, Twitter or email, many surveys have                         reached our team. These are the teams we helped by                         distributing and answering their questions:
Evry :                                 knowledge of plastic contamination and opinion                                 about the use of PLA produced by bacteria as an                                 alternative.
Goettingen :                                 what we know about vitamin B12 and what is the general understanding of biotechnology and the                                 chances seen in it.
Groningen :                                 how sensitive information is saved, if people                                 trust in those methods of information storing                                 and how they would value the use of bacteria to                                 store their information.
Hannover :                                 survey about how useful would be for                                 researchers their project, TALebots, and why it                                 would be useful or not compared to other                                 techniques of gene editing.
LMU-TUM_Munich :                                 survey about enabling factors involved in                                 crating biotech companies from iGEM teams,                                 taking in account the results of the team                                 during the last Jamboree and what they did                                 after that.

It aims to give a                                 feed-back on the projects, in order to know how                                 the RRI principles have been respected. We had                                 a beautiful badge for answering!
