Medals
Bronze
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and                             attend the Giant Jamboree, done!
Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page:                             sample submission, safety forms and judging forms,                             completed! We hope you like our wiki, our poster                             and our presentation in the Jamboree
Create a page which must clearly attribute work done by the students and                                 distinguish it from work done by others,                                 including host labs, advisors, instructors,                                 sponsors, professional website designers,                                 artists, and commercial services.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick                             Part or Device central to your project and submit                             this part to the iGEM Registry: we submitted BBa_K2017004 , as one of the best working                                 linker with luciferase for our gRNA testing                                 system.
Silver
Experimentally validate that at least one new                             BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and                             construction works as expected. Document the                             characterization of this part in the Main Page                             section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device.                             This working part must be different from the part                             you documented in Bronze medal criterion #4. Submit                             this part to the iGEM Parts Registry: BBa_K2017008 was submitted, our best working device of the gRNA                             testing system.
Convince the judges you have helped any                             registered iGEM team from a high-school, different                             track, another university, or institution in a                             significant way by, for example, mentoring a new                             team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct,                             modeling/simulating their system or helping                             validate a software/hardware solution to a                             synthetic biology problem: in our collaborations page you can check our                                 compromise with being in contact with other teams and help in everything we could.
Demonstrate how your team has identified,                             investigated and addressed one or more of these                             issues in the context of your project, for example                             relating to (but not limited to) ethics,                             sustainability, social justice, safety, security,                             and intellectual property rights:
We demonstrated a social engagement in compromise                                         with scientific communication, with                                         childs and with adults.
Our team analyzed the safety concerns that our project                                         could have, specially related to viral                                         vectors and plant editing.
Gold
Expand on your silver medal activity by                             demonstrating how you have integrated the                             investigated issues into the design and/or                             execution of your project: we made an impact assessment of HYPE-IT in                                 environment, nutrition, society and economy.                                 Interviews with stakeholders allowed us to adjust and reconsider some of our                                 ideas, and to obtain a global view of how could                                 really our project improve food and nutrition.
Improve the function OR characterization of a                             previously existing BioBrick Part or Device                             (created by another team, or by your own team in in                             a previous year of iGEM), and enter this                             information in the part’s page on the Registry: we                             used the inteins of 2014 Heidelberg team, BBa_K1362400 and BBa_K1362401 .                                 We improved their characterization by testing                                 them in plant Nicotiana benthamiana with                                 the split-Cas9.
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of                             your project. Your proof of concept must consist of                             a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot                             constitute a proof of concept: we have proved that                             one of the mainstays of our project, viral delivery                             of split-Cas9 in plants, works and edits the chosen                             target. The parts that constitute together the Cas9                             (each part a half of the split-Cas9) are BBa_K2017000 and BBa_K2017001 .
Achievements
There are three mainstays in our project:
Database and data processing software
We gathered more than 200 entries in a database that relates plant phenotypes with                                 genes that can be knocked-out to obtain the                                 desired phenotype. These entries were obtained                                 with manual curation of references and adding                                 predicted genes using homology.
A Data Processing Software allows any user to                                 search in the database, to search gRNAs in                                 genes and to add new genes and phenotypes. It                                 is a collaborative tool that actually makes                                 accesible CRISPR/Cas9.
Split-Cas9 delivery with viral vectors: our team successfully performed gene editing with split-Cas9 and                         a gRNA in vivo! You can check in our Results page.
Low cost labware and reagents, including a gRNA testing                         system:
We made laboratory equipment low cost, eight                             tools for around 800€. You can read more in our Hardware page.
We designed devices based on Goldenbraid                             assembly that make editing with CRISPR/Cas9 easy to                             use, similar to Lego pieces. You can check in reagents and how to perform a plant editing                                 with HYPE-iT following our manuals .
