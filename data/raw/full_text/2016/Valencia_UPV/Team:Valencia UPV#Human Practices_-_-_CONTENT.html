                        affects society? Those words got stuck in Valencia UPV
                        team when we first read about human practices in iGEM.
                        Science and innovation are nothing if it does not exist
                        a relationship between them and people. We aimed to
                        create a link not only between our project and society,
                        but also between synthetic biology and people. Our team
                        also made a deep study of how HYPE-IT and its usage can
                        improve several factors in communities. In the
                        following lines it is shown a summary of what we made
                        for our human practices. If you want to deeply read
                        about any of this points, you can access the pages
                        through the navigation bar.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item"><H3>Social engagement</H3><P>One of the first and most important issues for
                        scientist nowadays is the rejection of society towards
                        certain technologies. In the case of synthetic biology
                        and genetic plant breeding techniques, this afraid is
                        remarkable. But the important question is, why does
                        this happen? We conducted a survey about plant breeding
                        techniques, comparing CRISPR/Cas9 with transgenic and
                        other traditional techniques. We concluded, as
                        expected, that the problem relies on education and the
                        lack of communication from scientific community towards
                        non-expert people. For that reason, we decided to do
                        our part and begin to spread the word of synthetic
                        biology. We gave a workshop of genetic and synbio for
                        children between 10 and 12 years old in the City of
                        Arts and Science during the Summer School, with the
                        slogan “Scientists of the Future”. The sooner they
                        begin to understand how synbio works, the better they
                        can analyze and evaluate by themselves its benefits and
                        disadvantages. Our team did not forget about adults.
                        Sometimes is it just necessary to explain in a relaxed
                        and enjoyable way to change minds and convince people.
                        We gave a talk in a pub in Valencia, participating in
                        the initiative “Skepticals in the Pub”, about what is
                        synbio and what can it do for us in the future.<A class="btn btn-reveal btn-teal" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Valencia_UPV/HP/Silver" style="float:right;"><SPAN>Social
                        engagement</SPAN></A></P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item"><H3>Impact assessment</H3><P>Our team was deeply interested on the real impact
                        that our project could have on society at many
                        different levels. The aim of HYPE-IT is to improve
                        accessibility for plant genome editing with
                        CRISPR/Cas9. But, why is this that important? Why do
                        local plant breeders need to access the new plant
                        breeding technologies? Why is important to make it easy
                        for them? What happens if our product begins to be
                        used?
                        We decided to make a study of the impact of our project
                        on society, at the environmental, economic, social and
                        nutritional level. To do this, we provide three
                        scenarios where HYPE-IT could be beneficial to society.
                        We identify at what extent does HYPE-IT improve those
                        impacts and if it might have unexpected negative
                        effects. This will allow us to re-shape our project
                        accordingly.
                        To give more support to our purpose of improving
                        accessibility for new plant breeding techniques, we
                        made an economic viability analysis. This analysis will
                        provide us from feedback of how our product should be
                        sold to reach our purpose and at the same time being
                        able to make it sustainable. With the aim to make this
                        analysis realistic, we talked with the main
                        stakeholders for our project: agricultural research
                        centers, seedbeds and farmers.<A class="btn btn-reveal btn-teal" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Valencia_UPV/HP/Gold" style="float:right;"><SPAN>Impact assessment</SPAN></A></P></DIV><DIV class="blog-post-item"><H3>Safety</H3><P>Finally, it is necessary to assess how our project
                        might affect health and safety in society. Regarding
                        plant genome editing, in the European Union there are
                        serious legal issues, which have not yet been solved
                        for CRISPR/Cas9 editing. It is unclear if EU will
                        approve crops modified with this editing system: the
                        success of HYPE-IT relies on this. A study of how our
                        product might damage or improve the environment by its
                        usage has been made, in order to know if additional
                        safety measures need to be taken in account. The use of
                        viral vectors might also be a concern of our project.
                        However, several containment measures can be made to
                        avoid risks.<A class="btn btn-reveal btn-teal" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Valencia_UPV/Safety" style="float:right;"><SPAN>Safety</SPAN></A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><FOOTER id="footer" style="margin-bottom:-20px"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-5"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 hidden-xs" style="padding:0;"><DIV class="margin-left-50 clearfix"><H4 class="margin-bottom-10" style="text-align:start;">Follow
