Introduction
One of the main barriers faced by research is the                         high cost of the laboratory equipment. To avoid this                         problem the team Hype-it has designed a set of hardware                         to make possible working with the technology                         CRISPR/Cas9 for plant genome editing (and others) at a                         low price (<1000€). Approximately 7% of what usually                         costs a set of the same hardware of commercial                         brands.
For the design of this hardware the designing team has                         worked with the wet lab team in order to have an                         effective feedback and give the ideal solutions that                         better fit the needs of the final user.
The designed hardware not only has proved to be                         functional but also has been proved to be able to rival                         professional laboratory equipment.

WHAT IS IT FOR IN OUR PROJECT
The aim of the structure is to hold all the devices                         designed by Hype-it team. Is included a case in order                         to keep the whole system safe. The lightness of the                         Labware allows anyone to carry it between different                         labs.
KEY PARTS OF THIS MACHINE
Aluminium Structure: The main part of the                         structure is made of aluminium from Mecaduino Brand                         because it gives the optimal relation stability-weight.                         For the joining of the profiles it has been used the                         option of perpendicular joints with hidden                         tensor.
Power supply: All the equipment designed by us                         needs a direct current (DC) electricity source. For                         this purpose we have chosen a 12V 15A (180W) power                         supply with security for short circuits.
Wire: The power supply is connected to a wire of                         16 A that can be removed to store the Labware                         better.
Screen: Any user who works with this kind of                         systems needs a way of communication with the labware.                         To achieve this our proposal is a smart LCD for arduino                         and 3D printers with button, which allows to easily                         control all the labware.
Arduino Mega: It will be the “brain” of the                         labware. It is only needed one Arduino to control all                         the machines at the same time, reducing in this way the                         final cost.
External parts (cover): The external parts are                         made of methacrylate because it is easy to clean and                         can resist chemical attacks.
We have added holes to refrigerate the inside of the                         system.

ELECTROPORATOR
Working voltage: 0V to 1600V
Resolution: 2.5V
Time range: 0.5-10.0 ms
Price: 57,07€
WHAT IS IT FOR IN OUR PROJECT
The electroporator is a machine which applies an                         electrical field to cells in order to increase the                         permeability of the cell membrane. This is used to                         transform bacteria by introducing new coding DNA,                         plasmids.
It works by passing through 1500 volts across a special                         cuvette, where electrocompetent bacteria are introduced.
FUNCTION PRINCIPLE
To produce the high voltage electrical pulse it is                         necessary a high voltage power supply. The problem is                         that this type of power supply does not have much                         power, so it cannot be able to maintain constant the                         voltage in the cuvette. One solution is the use of a                         capacitor to accumulate the energy before doing the                         electroporation. Hence, a MOSFET will be used to                         control the duration of the pulse.
OUR RESULTS
To test the low-cost electroporator, we transform                         electrocompetent DH5α E. coli with a plasmid                         with purple color ( BBa_K592009 ).                         One petri dish was cultured with bacteria transformed                         with the low-cost electroporator (left), and the other                         with bacteria transformed with a professional                         electroporator as positive control (right).
In the picture it can be seen that colony density is higher with our low-cost electroporator, meaning that                         the transformation was probably more efficient. This                         suggests that the electroporator designed works better                         than the professional electroporator we had in the                         laboratory.
In order to repeat the experiment and test its                         reproducibility, we did tried with two more different                         plasmids. In the first we used a plasmid with dsRed.                         The transformed cells should express a red protein. As                         seen in the picture, bacteria were successfully                         transformed.
The second plasmid has GFP, so colonies should be green                         under the fluorescence microscope. This third                         experiment was also successful.
KEY PARTS OF THIS MACHINE
High voltage power supply: this power supply                         will provide the voltage needed to electroporate. It is                         based in a DC-DC boost converter and the output voltage can be adjusted between 300V to 1200V. Because the                         normal voltage for electroporation is 1500V, we will                         need two of this power supplies connected in                         serie.
High voltage capacitor: The capacitor will                         accumulate the energy needed for electroporation. The                         voltage rating of the capacitor should be greater than                         1500V in order to provide a security margin. The value                         of capacitance can be choosen between 1uF and 8uF, in                         this range the capacitor will accumulate enough energy                         and can be charged quickly. We selected a capacitor of                         1600V and 1uF.
High voltage MOSFET: The mosfet acts like a                         switch in the circuit. When the mosfet is in the “off”                         state, the high voltage source will charge the                         capacitor. When the mosfet is in the “on” state, the                         capacitor discharges through the load, producing a                         negative pulse voltage. The voltage rating of the                         mosfet selected is 1700V, and the nominal current is                         4.9A.
MOSFET: It is also needed a MOSFET to activate                         and deactivate the high voltage power supply. The input                         of the power supply is 12V, so we use a mosfet with a                         55V and 41 A rating.
Cuvette Holder: The cuvette needs to be                         connected electrically to the electroporator circuit,                         so a 3D printed cuvette holder has been designed. This                         design includes a poka-yoke, so the cuvette will only                         fit in the correct way. It also has two copper plates                         to make contact with the electrodes of the                         cuvette.
ELECTRICAL MODEL OF THE CUVETTE
The cuvette used in this machine is a 1 mm gap                         electroporation cuvette. Electroporation cuvettes can                         have different gap sizes. This size will determine the                         voltage of the electroporation.
This type of cuvette, which contains two parallel plate                         electrodes, can be modeled as a resistor and a                         capacitor in parallel.
The value of the resistance can be calculated with the                         next equation:
Where l is the size of the gap between the plates,                         sigma is the conductivity of the buffer solution and A                         is the area of the electrodes.
The value of the capacitance can be calculated this                         way:
where e_o is the permittivity of free space (8.85 x                         10°-12 F/m), e_r is the water dielectric constant, A is                         the area of the electrode, and d is the gap distance                         between electrodes.
The resistance has a typical value between 10 ohm and                         15 koh. On the other hand, the capacitance is                         independent of the medium conductivity and it is 35 pF.
CIRCUIT
The circuit that implements the electroporator is the                         following one:
Q1 is the high voltage mosfet, which will control the                         charge and discharge of the capacitor C1. The mosfet Q1                         is driven with one digital output of the arduino. When                         Q1 is in “off” state the capacitor will charge through                         the resistor R4. This resistor is used to limit the                         current demand to the high voltage source.
The capacitor will take a few seconds to charge, so to                         be sure that it is fully charged there is a tension                         divider to measure the actual voltage in the capacitor.                         This divider is implemented with two resistors R1 and                         R2, that will reduce voltage of +1500 V to +3 V, so                         this voltage can be read with an analog input of the                         Arduino.
Then, when the capacitor is charged to the desired                         voltage, the mosfet Q1 will change to “on” state so the                         capacitor will discharge through the cuvette and the                         mosfet Q1, producing a negative pulse across the                         cuvette.
The high voltage source needs a +12V input to start                         working, so a mosfet Q2 is used to control the on/off                         state of the high voltage source. The mosfet Q2 is                         controlled by the Arduino with one digital output. This                         way, it is secure to discharge the capacitor.
FUTURE LINES
In the design we have proposed, the mosfet are                         connected directly to the arduino. This will reduce the                         lifetime of both the Arduino and the mosfet. So even                         though the current design works, it will be good to                         have a mosfet driver circuit in between the Arduino and                         the mosfet.

COLORIMETER
This device works for a wavelength of 650                             nm.
Deviation = 0.007 OD
Price: 26,2€
WHAT IS IT FOR IN OUR PROJECT
The aim of the colorimeter is to calculate the                         concentration of bacteria in the sample. Cell                         concentration is key in the agroinfiltration process: a                         low concentration means that few plant cells will be                         infected, and a high concentration will damage the                         plant. The optimal range is 1.8-2.2 OD.
FUNCTION PRINCIPLE
The light emitted from the laser goes across the sample                         in the tube and is sensed by the photodiode in the                         other side of the tube. This measure is compared to the                         measure that would be obtained if the light had gone                         across as if there was any sample. The equation to                         calculate the optical density is the following one:
OD = - (1/L)*log10(I/Io)
Where :
L = distance the light travels across the sample in                         centimeters
I = light intensity that goes across the sample
Io = light intensity emitted
OUR RESULTS
We tested the density meter with optical filters.                         This filters have a fixed range of optical density                         values between 0.2 OD and 1.5 OD.
In the following graph, it is compared the value of the                         measured optical density and the real value.
Deviation = 0.007 OD (error bars too small for being watched)
The result is that the lectures of the density meter                         are virtually identical to the real values. For each                         value of real OD, we did three measures and the                         deviation was 0.0007 OD.
In conclusion, this density meter design has proved to                         be great with high accuracy lectures and extremely low                         deviation. The specifications of this density meter can                         be easily compared with a high cost professional                         density meter.
It should be recalled its low cost, around only                         27€.
KEY PARTS OF THIS MACHINE
Tube holder: This part of the machine will hold                         the tube. It is recommended to have this part covered                         and black painted, or printed with black PLA or ABS.                         Our design includes a poka-yoke in order to help the                         user with the use of the machine.
Laser: The laser will emit the light that will                         go cross the tube. The wavelength of the laser will                         determine the wavelength of the measures. The most                         common to measure optical density in cells is 600 nm.                         Being necessary to choose a laser around that                         wavelength, we selected a 650 nm laser. It is important                         that the light beam generated is in dot shape, this                         will improve the precision of the lectures. Finally,                         the power generated by the laser has to be around 3W.                         With lower power the sensibility can be reduced and                         with higher values the sensor might get                         saturated.
Sensor: A photodiode has been selected to                         measure the light that has gone trough. This type of                         sensors have a high sensibility and precision. The                         sensor selected is a TSL235-LF and it converts light                         into frequency, which can be measured with                         Arduino.
CIRCUIT
The circuit that implements the colorimeter is the                         following one:
It is a simple and efficient design. A mosfet is used                         to drive the laser module and the output of the sensor                         has to be connected to an Arduino digital pin with                         interruptions. This is crucial, because the arduino                         program uses interruptions in order to measure the                         output frequency of the sensor. The pins which can do                         interruptions in Arduino Mega are 2, 3, 18, 19, 20 and                         21.

WHAT IS IT FOR IN OUR PROJECT
Generally, the purpose of a centrifuge is to separate                         particles dense particles from low-density substances.                         Working with bacteria, it is common its use for the                         extraction of plasmids using special kits, that allow                         the separation of the plasmidic DNA. This is achieved                         thanks to a filter that is put in the sample tubes                         which are centrifuged using specially prepared                         solutions. The centrifuge is also used in genomic DNA                         extraction from plant samples. The centrifuge has been                         designed to reach 13,000 rpm, which is the maximum                         speed needed for a plasmid extraction.
FUNCTION PRINCIPLE
The centrifuge makes spin at high velocity objects,                         then the centripetal acceleration will cause denser                         substances and particles to move outward. In the other                         hand, substances that are less denser will get                         displaced to the center. The normal use in the laboratory is to use sample tubes and the goal is to                         separate substances by its density.
OUR RESULTS
We tested the centrifuge and was able to reach speeds                         of 13.000 rpm. In the following graph we show the                         temporal response of the centrifuge by increasing the                         control action every 10 seconds:
The minimum control action is 1000 and the maximum is                         2000. In this graphic we can see that with a control                         action of 1250 we can get around 8000rpm.
We have done a control that manage to establish the                         speed of the centrifuge to the desired speed.
KEY PARTS OF THIS MACHINE
Rotor: The rotor is the part of the centrifuge                         that will be connected to the motor and where the                         sample tubes will fit. Rotors are normally expensive so                         a 3D printed rotor has been designed. This design is                         able to support the forces produced by the                         spinning.
Motor brushless: The centrifuge has to get high                         speed and also needs high torque to be able to move the                         rotor and the sample tubes. A DC brushless motor has                         this two requirements, and it is also easy to set its                         speed to a certain value, being very reliable. The                         technical specifications for this motor are KV and A.                         KV refers to the rpm constant of the motor - it is the                         number of revolutions per minute that the motor turn                         for each 1 volt supplied. A is the maximum current it                         can demand. This value is directly related to the                         torque it can produce. Motors with bigger KV tend to                         have less torque. For the centrifuge a high KV will be                         needed to reach the a high speed but it is also                         important not to pick a huge KV value because the motor                         will not be able to move the rotor. A KV above 1200                         means that if you supply the motor with +12V you will                         get a maximum of 14400 rpm. Finally, a value for A                         around 25 works perfectly.
ESC(Electronic Control Speed): The ESC will                         control the power supplied to the brushless motor. This                         way the speed will be controlled. It is important to                         match the specifications of the ESC with the                         specifications of the motor. The most important value                         is that the max A of the ESC is bigger or at least                         equal to the A of the motor. This way, the ESC will                         never burn due to an overcurrent produced by the                         motor.
Tachometer: The tachometer is an electronical                         device that counts the revolutions per second the rotor                         does. There are many types of tachometers but normally                         they consist of an infrared emitter and an infrared                         sensor. Every time the rotor spins the beam generated                         by the emitter will be cut, producing a pulse in the                         measure of the sensor. This way counting the number of                         pulsed generated the rpm can be measured with high                         precision.
CONTROL
To control the speed of the centrifuge we have                         designed a PI controller to reach the setted speed and                         have zero error. This way the centrifuge will always                         spin at the speed it is demanded, independently of the                         weight of the sample tubes.
CIRCUIT
The circuit that implements the centrifuge is the                         following one:
The arduino will control the speed of the motor through                         the ESC, so it will be needed a digital pin. Then the                         speed is measured with the tachometer and converted                         into analog electrical pulses. This pulses are readed                         with a analog input of the Arduino.
FUTURE LINES
There are two different main future lines. One is                         related with security: it will be necessary to add for                         the security system an automatic lock and unlock of the                         cap. The other line addresses the vibration movement.                         The system will be improved by adding two bearings in                         the shaft.

WHAT IS IT FOR IN OUR PROJECT
Electrophoresis is a technique used to separate DNA                         samples according to its length. It is used to separate                         a desired DNA fragment or to check if a DNA sample is                         the expected.
FUNCTION PRINCIPLE
The DNA is placed in wells of the agarose gel. Then an                         electrical field is applied. The DNA is affected by the                         electrical field, and it will start moving through the                         gel. Shorter DNA fragments will move faster than larger                         DNA fragments, causing the separation of the DNA by its                         size.
OUR RESULTS
We tested the low-cost electrophoresis cuvette and the                         power supply doing an electrophoresis, using a                         molecular marker. In the next figure, we can see the                         obtained electrophoresis in a transilluminator.
It can be checked that the separation has correctly                         been performed.
KEY PARTS OF THIS MACHINE
Power source: The power source will generate the                         electrical field needed for the electroporation. The                         typically voltage of this source is 100V but a                         different voltage value can be used. The voltage will                         determine the time will require the electrophoresis to                         separate the DNA. In our project, a 48V source is used                         and it takes one and half hour to work. The last                         parameter is the power, the current generated through                         the gel is normally around 100 mA so with 25W it will                         be more than enough.
Electroporation cuvette: In this cuvette is                         where the electroporation will be done. These cuvettes                         are expensive so a 3D printable model has been                         designed, including the comb and the gel mold. In                         addition to the 3D cuvette some electronic parts are                         also needed, but they are minimal: just two banana                         connectors and two platinum cover wires. The platinum                         cover wire is strictly necessary. Other type of wires                         will oxidize during the electrophoresis. It is critical                         to make sure that there are not any leaks in the                         cuvette.
UV light: UV light is necessary to make visible                         the DNA bands. The easiest way to produce UV light is                         to use a UV torch.
CIRCUIT
The following circuit implements the eletrofesis power                         source and cuvette.
The +48V power source is connected through a mosfet to                         the electrophoresis cuvette. This way the we can select                         to apply voltage or not to the cuvette. The Arduino                         will control the mosfet so it is possible to set the                         amount of time you need to apply the voltage.
FUTURE LINES
The UV torch is a easy way to visualize the result of                         the electrophoresis, but it is not very handy and the                         UV light is dangerous. It will be better to have a                         small transilluminator where the gel can be placed.                         This way you can avoid to expose yourself to the UV                         light. There are some DIY (do it yourself) designs on                         the internet.

STIRRER WITH CONTROLLED TEMPERATURE
This device can shake the samples with a ratio                             of 600 r.p.m.
The temperature can be setted between 15ºC and                             45ºC.
Price: 81.24€
WHAT IS IT FOR IN OUR PROJECT
The aim of the stirrer with controlled temperature is                         to allow the uniform growth of Agrobacterium tumefaciens (28ºC) and Escherichia Coli (37ºC)                         after they have been transformed and selected from the                         culture plates. It is also used to distribute the                         agroinfiltration solution inside the tubes with Agrobacterium before agroinfiltration.
FUNCTION PRINCIPLE
Bacteria need oxygen as well as different sources of                         energy, if there is not movement during the growth,                         they go to the bottom of the tube and have not acces to                         the nutrients causing small growth.
The optimum temperature to grow the bacteria needed to                         improve a plant variety are between 34 and 39 ºC this                         is why to have a good bacterial culture is needed to                         keep the temperature around 34 and 39ºC as                         mentioned.
To carry out this purpose has been designed an orbital                         stirrer (to get the movement) with a peltier cell on it                         to keep the temperature.
OUR RESULTS
We tested the temperature control in the stirrer by                         setting a temperature reference of 37.0ºC. In the                         following graphic we can see the response of the                         system:
It took about 150 seconds ( 2 and a half minutes) to                         reach the desired temperature, in addition the system                         was able to maintain constant the temperature in the                         reference value. In conclusion, the control works                         properly so the stirrer is functional.
KEY PARTS OF THIS MACHINE
Tubes holder: This part of the machine will hold                         the tubes and receive the heat from the peltier cell,                         this is the reason for have a part made of metal due                         the high heat conductivity.
Peltier cell: The difference of tension between                         the poles, produce a delta of temperature in both                         surfaces of the peltier. The warm part is used to keep                         the tubes at 37ºC.
LM35: Our temperature sensor: To keep the                         temperature at 37ºC is needed a feedback from the own                         system in closed loop, with a Proportional,Integral and                         Derivative (PID) control.
Bearings: The soft movement is got thanks to the                         bearings.
Motor: Nema 17+polulu driver a4988, its function                         is to shake the tubes with a controlled speed. One of                         the advantages is the easiness of programming of the                         driver because it has only 3 ports:step, direction, and                         on.
CIRCUIT
The circuit that implements the stirrer is the                         following one. It realizes three tasks: (1) control the                         peltier, (2) measure the temperature and (3) drive the                         stepper motor.
The peltier is control through a mosfet by applying a                         PWM. The resistors R1 and R2 reduce the current demand                         of the mosfet, protecting the Arduino.
The temperature is measured with a LM35 attached to a                         analog pin of the Arduino.
The stepper motor is controlled by the driver a4988.                         The speed and the direction are controlled by two                         digital pin of the Arduino.

PHYTOTRON
This device works in a range of temperature of                             (15 to 30 ºC)
Temperature resolution = 1 degree
Measures humidity
Nett space: 40x80 Cm
Consume: 160W
Price: 97.6€
WHAT IS IT FOR IN OUR PROJECT
The use of the phytotron is to grow plants in the                         optimal conditions, In the particular case of Nicotiana                         Benthamiana 16 hours periods of light, and 24 ºC.
FUNCTION PRINCIPLE
To keep the temperature at 24ºC, we have taken peltier                         modules, even its consume is high. The reason reducing                         the budget and the size of the hardware we have                         projected. To bigger scales, peltier cells would be the                         worst option due to the high consume.
The lights chosen are leds because of its ability to                         emit the wavelength that chlorophyll needs to                         photosynthesis.
As you can see the chlorophyll A and B have different                         absorption peaks, but these peaks are covered by the                         different peaks from the LEDs although the chlorophyll                         peaks and LED peaks are not in the same                         wavelength.
OUR RESULTS
The fitotron is capable of monitoring the temperature                         and the humidity with an one second of sampling time.                         It has been tested the temperature control and it is                         able to maintain the temperature constant in 24                         degrees.
In the following picture you can see the result of the                         phytotron:
KEY PARTS OF THIS MACHINE
The “box”: To this purpose we have selected a                         commercial solution from a known brand.To keep the                         temperature we have opted by an isolation material used                         in construction.
Peltier cooling system: The purpose of the                         peltier module is to keep the “box” in the setted                         temperature.
We have added to the “box” 2 peltiers in order to have                         a lower temperature difference.
Q=h*A*T1-T2
where Q is the energy we need to remove from the box, h                         the convection air coefficient, and T1,T2 the                         temperature of the material and the air, and A is the                         area of the different sides of the box.
h=50
A=1 m°2
T1-T2=25 ºK
Q=50W
One peltier cooling system would not be enough because                         in its 72W are included the fans what makes only a 60W                         but due the low efficiency of this system 40 W of real                         refrigeration.This is why we have added an other                         peltier cooling system.
Sensor: We have used a temperature sensor to                         have the feedback and keep the temperature with a                         closed loop. The sensor chosen has been the KY-015                         DHT11 Temperature Humidity Sensor Module For Arduino.                         Also, with this sensor we can measure the                         humidity.
The leds: Maybe talk about blue leds is                         something weird for most of the people, but things                         change when we talk about cold white light from leds,                         what is the same. The option selected has been Lexman                         LED REFLECTORA REGULABLE GU10.
Arduino UNO R3: Will manage the control of the                         whole system.
CONTROL
The controller is designed as a closed loop PID. Due to                         the fitotron is a big space, the temperature control                         gets difficult because all the response in temperature                         are extremely slow. So we had to be extremely careful                         in the tuning of the PID.
Finally we were able to control the temperature in the                         range of 15ºC to 35ºC.
CIRCUIT
The circuit that implements the phytotron is the                         following one:
This circuit realizes several functions: (1) actives                         the fans of the peltier modules and the fan of                         ventilation, (2) measures the temperature and humidity                         and (3) control the power supply to the peltiers                         cells.
The fans always have to be on so they connected                         directly to the power supply.
The sensor DHT11 is attached to a digital pin of the                         Arduino.
The power of the peltiers is controlled by the mosfet                         Q1 with a PWM. The relays will change the polarity of                         the peltiers cells, changing its state to cool or to                         heat. The relay are driven by two mosfet.
This machine has his own Arduino and his own power                         supply due to it will be outside of the structure.
FUTURE LINES
The main parts to improve in this design are related                         with 2 different variables, CO2 and humidity.
These key factors will make that plants grow in the                         optimal conditions.

WHAT IS IT FOR IN OUR PROJECT
The thermocycler is a machine commonly used to amplify                         DNA, but it can be used as well in others reactions                         affected by temperature.
FUNCTION PRINCIPLE
The thermocycler has a thermal block where reaction                         tubes can be introduced in its pierced surface, and it                         raises and lowers the temperature of the block                         according to a preprogrammed temperature stages.
OUR RESULTS
We did a test that consist in generating the                         temperature cycles needed for a PCR. We obtained very                         good results, we did manage to get the temperature                         needed and also the time required. In the following                         graph we can see the temperature cycles:
However the PCR is a very sensitive process so although                         we have accomplished the temperature and time                         requirements we did not manage to make the PCR work.                         This can be caused for multiple factors. The most                         probable one is that the sensor we have is on the                         aluminium block so the temperature we measure is                         slightly different that the temperature inside the                         reaction tubes. A difference of a few degrees is                         crucial in a PCR, and can suppose the difference                         between a working PCR and a non.working PCR.
We are currently working in a program to estimate the                         temperature inside the reaction tubes.
KEY PARTS OF THIS MACHINE
Thermoblock: The thermoblock is made from                         aluminium plates. Aluminium was chosen due to its high                         thermal conductivity and its low thermal inertia. Since                         reaction tubes are meant to be placed here, it is                         critical that the tubes make a good contact with the                         thermoblock to prevent differences between the                         temperature of the block and the tube.
Peltier cell: The peltier will make the                         temperature variations in the thermoblock. The peltier                         is a electronical device able to produce heat or cold.                         On one hand, the peltier is easy to install in the                         thermoblock and has the ability of cooling. On the                         other hand, this device consumes a significant amount of power, so it will be necessary to have an electronic                         power driver which is hard to design. A peltier of at                         least 100W will be need in order to change the                         temperature satisfying the specifications. We choose a                         150W peltier cell in order to have a security margin in                         the power specifications.
Heat sink: In order to get more efficiency from                         the peltier cell it will be needed a heat sink. The                         heat sink will keep one of the faces of the peltier                         cell to ambient temperature, this way the face that is                         in contact with the thermoblock will get heated or                         cooled easily. The heat sink is composed by a fan and                         an aluminium sink.
Temperature sensor: The temperature sensor will                         be crucial. It has to have a low error, lower than 0.5                         ºC, high precision, and also it need to have a fast                         time response. We choosed the sensor LM35CA.
CIRCUIT
The circuit design realize three task: (1) lecture                         of temperature, (2) switch between heating or cooling                         state and (3) provides regulated power to the                         peltier.
In order to measure the temperature the sensor LM35CA                         is attach to the analog input of the Arduino
There are two relay that will change the way is                         connected the peltier cell. This way the peltier can be                         power with positive and negative voltage. The arduino                         does not have enough power to activate the relays so                         two channel N mosfet are used to provide the power.
A channel N mosfet is used to generate a PWM to                         regulate the power feeded to the peltier cell. This                         mosfet is controlled by a digital arduino pin.
CONTROL
A PID with a regulator has been design in order to                         control the temperature.This is extremely robust and it                         secure to get to the reference value of temperature in                         a low time.
However the dynamic response was poorly due to the                         influence of the ambient temperature. So an ambient                         temperature pre-alimentation has been designed and it                         has improve the dynamic response.
FUTURE LINES
The most difficult part of this machine is the                         thermoblock, it is hard to make it from aluminium                         plates. So a improve will consist to do a 3D model and                         then send it to fabricate in aluminium.
An other line,could consist in the improvement of the                         peltier power what would lead to a better thermal                         response, this will improve the efficiency of the                         thermocycler.

LUMINOMETER
Wavelenght: 400 to 1000nm
Price: 24.3€
WHAT IS IT FOR IN OUR PROJECT
The luminometer is designed in order to allow the                         detection of light produced by the some bioluminescent                         molecules such as luciferin/luciferase. Our gRNA                         Testing System enables the determination of the                         efficiency of a gRNA by observing the mutagenesis with a luminescence reporter.
FUNCTION PRINCIPLE
The samples emit bioluminescence with a wavelength                         between 400 and 600 nm. The light signal generated has                         very low power so a high sensitive sensor is needed. In                         addition, it is important to reduce external light that                         can influence the measures.
OUR RESULTS
With the design we proposed the external light was                         reduced to minimum values. But the problem was that the                         sensor chosen was not sensitive enough so we could not                         measure properly the bioluminescence generated.
We did a test with a positive control                         (35s:Luciferase:Tnos), a negative control                         (35s:Ga20oxPCR:AEK:Luc:Tnos-XT1) and empty. We did                         three measures of each sample.

The units of this measures are pulses generated by the                         sensor (the sensor converts light into frequency) in                         ten seconds. If the sensor is exposed to ambient light                         a normal value is around 10.000. With the empty sample                         we prove that the external light is reduced to minimum                         around 30. However the positive control and the                         negative control have the same value as the empty                         sample, meaning that the sensor does not have enough                         sensibility to differentiate them.
The are more expensive (more that 100€) sensors with                         higher sensibility that will be able to measure the                         bioluminescence.
However, in order to use the testing system is                         necessary to measure three sample at the same time                         -negative control, positive control and sample, that                         mean it is need to have three sensors. So if we use the                         expensive sensor will increase to much the final price                         of the labware and that will affect negatively the                         accessibility.
In conclusion we have tested different types of sensor                         but it is necessary to research more in order to find a                         sensor that is sensible enough and is low cost.
KEY PARTS OF THIS MACHINE
Structure: the structure of the luminometer one                         of the most important things. In this structure is                         where the sample tubes and the sensor will be placed.                         The structure has to be white in order to have a                         greater sensibility, this way the light will reflect in                         the inners walls of the structure so more light                         intensity will reach the sensor. However, if all the                         structure is white, external light will get across the                         walls and will reach the sensor, producing                         interferences in the signal measure. The solution is to                         cover or paint the external walls.
We have designed a 3D model structure that will                         accomplish all the specifications commented                         before.
Sensor: the sensor will measure the light                         intensity It is strictly necessary that the sensor                         works in wavelength from 300 to 600 nm. Moreover it                         will be also recommended that the sensor only measure                         in that wavelength, this way noise is reduced. We                         tested several photodiodes, but anyone could measure                         the bioluminescence properly. However the sensor                         TSL235R-LF perform good in terms of noise and stability                         in measures.
CIRCUIT
The circuit consist in the connection of the sensors                         TSL235R-LF to the Arduino Mega.
It is important that the sensor can only be attached to                         digital pins of the arduino which are associated with a                         interrupt line, because interruptions are needed in                         order to read the output of the sensors. Pins 18 , 19                         and 20 can do interruptions in Arduino Mega. But in                         Arduino UNO only pins 2 and 3 can be used.
FUTURE LINES
It is necessary to test different types of sensor in                         order to find one that is sensitive enough and not                         expensive. There exist a type of photodiode, the                         photomultiplier. This type of sensor is high sensitive                         and is the typical used for luminometers, however the                         are quite expensive so the might not be the                         solution.
