Nader Pourmand and Jevgenij Raskatov
Now that we had explored how the DIY biology movement is affecting the young scientists and engineers of the next generation, we wanted to better understand how plummeting costs for synthetic biology is affecting the experienced generation of university researchers. The rapidly accelerating technologies of full-genome sequencing and DNA synthesis represent immensely important tools in the tool-kit of synthetic biologists, and their expanded accessibility affects both veteran researchers and youthful scientists alike. Rather than focusing on methods of commercializing existing technologies, university researchers are often pioneering novel research that strives to make the technologies of tomorrow possible. Reflecting a positive feedback loop at its finest, this novel research often makes new technologies available, which in turn fuel researchers to create new technologies that follow.
To understand how these cost reductions could represent the next wave of technologies, we contacted two experienced, university researchers here at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Nader Pourmand is a Professor of Bioengineering and Director of the UCSC Genome Sequencing Center, whose research is focused upon biosensor sequencing technology. Jevgenij Raskatov is an assistant professor of the chemistry/biochemistry department, whose research lab focuses upon disease-oriented chemical biology to understand the molecular mechanisms of conditions associated with aging. We directed our discussion towards the idea of commercial viability, how projects can become more commercially viable, and how the recent trends of cost reduction has affected their research personally.
Upon beginning our interview, Dr. Pourmand expressed how commercial viability is often not the focus of university researchers; rather they work to develop and ‘push’ the technology forward. In response to this reality, Dr. Pourmand’s research lab emphasizes the importance of bridging the gap between industry and academia in hopes of fostering the real-world application of the research. Dr. Pourmand also asserted that the key to designing a project to be commercially viable is to not be disconnected from industry; their needs and methods are often different from academia and therefore must be tailored to industrial needs. Cost reduction, he states, expands the questions we can ask and the technologies we can develop. When asked about commercial viability, Dr. Raskatov took a very scientific approach to the question by noting the inherent nuance and variability of the term. In short, however, Jevgenij claimed that to be commercially viable you must tackle a project that affects people, solve the problem better than anyone else, and understand how to market the end product. To be a successful researcher, he claims, you must not only understand the fundamental problems at hand, but you must have a unique contribution and unique way of solving that problem. Dr. Raskatov explained that technologies such as DNA and peptide synthesis have evolved dramatically, and in doing so have made possible new research that had never before been possible. These technologies now allow researchers to take various elements of their research and connect them in ways no one ever has. Bringing up an important point, Dr. Raskatov mentioned how many of the most important discoveries in science history came from researchers who faced opposition, simply because people could not recognize the value of their work at the time. University research, in allowing for this ‘wiggle-room’ for creativity, unlocks phenomenal discoveries and technologies that a predetermined, industry-focused project perhaps never could. Dr. Raskatov then took us back to his younger days with a nostalgic story on a lipid analysis technology company his twenty-one year old self had almost started following a business competition he had entered. His advice, applicable to young scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs interested in starting a venture of their own, is that if you have a burning, insurmountable desire to see the venture through and are fully committed to your goal, then few obstacles can stop you. We thoroughly enjoyed both of our interviews, and we are incredibly grateful to the remarkable researchers, Dr. Pourmand and Dr. Raskatov, for dedicating their time to our questions.
