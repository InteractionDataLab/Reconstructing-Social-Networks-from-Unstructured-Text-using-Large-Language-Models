It’s essential for us to get accurate growth condition of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the natural environment to keep the concentration of toxin at a lethal level. But in fact, it is almost impossible to test concentration anywhere due to the lack of equipment and skills. Therefore, building the growth model can help determine the amount of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii they should use and when they need to add more. Based on the growth model which built by BNU-CHINA team, we gathered the data of sunshine, water temperature, nutrient content in water and so on from various papers. Meanwhile, SCUT-China A team helped us to test the real temperature in Guangzhou which has many problems about mosquitoes.
Based on the historical data and growth model, we predicted the growth curve of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in various environment. And we summarize the typical results to guide people to use our product easier.
