Team FAFU-CHINA
Junhao Lu
College of Plant Protection
Junior
Major: Plant Protection
I am a student leader of FAFU-CHINA team. After the last iGEM competition, I summarized the experience about how to build an integrated team, establish a reasonable project for such a short set-up time and so on. I am in charge of project, experiment, and human practice design. Meanwhile, I take charge about academic writing for content of wiki and poster. And I will give presentation at the Giant jamboree. Seeking cooperation during iGEM competition is also my task. Handing over my task to Hao Feng is a sensible choice for me because I would visit University of Alberta in Canada after summer. Attending iGEM firms my belief to purse scientific research as a life-long course.
 
 
Wenting Wu
College of Life Science

Major: Biotechnology
In order to get touch with more people who are interested in biology, I participated in the iGEM team (FAFU-CHINA) of my university and played as an art designer. Meanwhile, I will help lab group do some experiments. This experience is really meaningful to me.
 
Yue Qiu
College of Plant Protection
Sophomore
Major: Plant Protection
I am a member of art design group. I help the group to illustrate their process and result on wiki and poster and take photographs to record process during the experiments. Meanwhile, participating in the molecule cloning group is a challenging task for me. Being a part of this team improves my ability to solve complex problems.
 
Du Cao
College of Plant Protection
Junior
Major: Bioscience
I am a member of Human Practice Group in my team FAFU-CHINA. What I mainly work for the team is writing, analyzing questionnaire, searching academic materials for handbook of mosquitoes prevention, compiling the handbook and so on. Since dengue fever, Zika virus, and malaria that transmitted by special mosquitoes have been epidemic in many areas and threatened human health dramatically, it is high time to let people around learn more about what kinds of mosquitoes are pathogenic and how to prevent from epidemic diseases. It is exactly our group's aim. It is grateful that iGEM gives us undergraduates a platform to display our enthusiasm on research and novel ideas.
 
Tong Tong

Major: Bioinformatics
Hi! I'm Tong Tong, as you see, my first name and last name are spelled the same, so some of friends prefer to call me T Square. I'm a junior majoring in bioinformatics, and now an exchange student at UIUC. In this year's competition, I mainly focused on data analysis and academic writing. My recent research focuses on building gene regulatory network on Arabidopsis thaliana.
 
Yuepu Zhao
College of Plant Protection
Sophomore
Major: Plant Protection
In FAFU-CHINA, as a member of HP group and molecular clone group, I participated in the editing of mosquito handbook and did some experiments about transformation. The first time I heard about iGEM was on the welcome party when I just enrolled in my university. I was attracted to this synthetic biology competition after listening to the older students who shared their experience and feelings in iGEM. So I decided to join them although I am actually not good at biology. In this group, I learned plenty of biological knowledge and improved some basic research skills, such as searching scientific articles, self-learning and presentation. I appreciate it and wish FAFU-CHINA could do better in 2016.

Major: Plant Protection
I raise and do experiments on mosquitos in our team. In addition, l often write some academic material for our wiki and poster. iGEM is a giant organization in the world, it can encourage the growing of young adults and brings lots of useful tool or system about biology to human being.so l am glad to join in because it is a big challenge.
 
 
Hanfang Ni

Sophomore
Major : Plant Protection
It is the first time that I take part in this competition. At first I thought that the preparation program is a kind of easy thing, just including some experiments, some communication and another things. But when the program began, all those steps became harder then it seems to be.
Facing those challenges was not a very easy thing, and I even thought about giving up some times. Anger, depression, weariness…All the pressure leads to lack of sleeping and negative attitude. Then I told myself that I need to calm down.
Keeping calm to do the program better, I divided the large program into some small parts and gave those parts their own deadline. Just like organizing a story, the ways of beginning, transition, turning, climax and ending are all in need of thinking and preparing. To have the best organization, any error in logic is not allowed.
“Try the best to make it! ” I told myself. The difficulties in front of us are appearing to be solved. I still believe this method. Honestly speaking, this competition is not only a showing of ability but also a improvement of ability. And the most important thing that I learned from this competition is hard-working and self-confidence.   
 
Yi Cai
College of Agronomy
Sophomore
Major: Agronomy
I mainly focus on doing experiments on molecular cloning. I think the iGEM can build up my experimental skills and shape my knowledge hierarchy of science and synthetic biology. During the past few months, I have built deep friendships with my teammates and other participants of iGEM. I believe that I can open the door to a new world in the field of biology and meet excellent young people who are crazy about scientific research.
 
Liangdi Chen
College of Resources And Environment
Senior
Major: Environment engineering
Art designing by application software, such as Photoshop and Lightroom is my specialty. I lead an art designing group to design poster, wiki and badge. I think iGEM is an international platform to show the research work from every team. As an art designer, I will try my best to vividly show our result in a perfect way.
 
Xinyu Huang

Sophomore
Major: Bioscience
In the team FAFU-CHINA, I am responsible for molecular cloning and transformation on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. I am extremely proud of being able to participate in this grand competition and looking forward to sharing and exchanging our intriguing project to all iGEMers who bear lots of fascinating ideas. I am also a foodie, welcome everyone to share food with me.
Tianyu DU
College: College of Plant Protection
Sophomore
Major: Plant Biology
I’m Tianyu Du from College of Plants Protection. I choose to take part in iGEM because not only can I contribute to this team by assisting teammates in some experiments but also I can learn a lot from people who are more experienced. I have been a member of FAFU-CHINA team for half a year. During this period, I learn something that cannot be acquired from textbooks and also understand what scientific research is in real life and the scientific spirit. Thanks to FAFU-CHINA and iGEM headquarter, a clear road to science has been built for me.
 
Muchen Cai
