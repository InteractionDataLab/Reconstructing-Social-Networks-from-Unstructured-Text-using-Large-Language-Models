Collaborations
This year, FAFU-CHINA team had many collaborations with many Chinese teams and exchanges parts with them. We helped different teams to design protocol, construct the parts and verify their results independently. Meanwhile, other teams helped us to build model, test the accurate data and purify the expressed protein. Parts exchange also played an important role in collaborations.
Collaborations with SZU-China team
On 17thJune, Junhao visited the Shenzhen University and their team (SZU-China) after Synthesis Biology Meeting. SZU-China focused how to utilize Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii to produce more hydrogen. We also tried to express toxin proteins in Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii. Based on the various background, they transform plasmids into Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii by glass-bead method while we used electroporation. The genetic transformation in Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii is still big problem, with their help, the transformation of Cry10Aa-2A-Cyt1 was successful by glass-bead method.
Meanwhile, due to various and unknown reasons, SZU-China encountered a common problem that they failed to get any clone or amplified the PSB1C3 plasmid could not get any clone in the lab. We reproduced their experiment in our lab. Luckily, we got the positive result and figured out that their Chloramphenicol was inactivated.

Collaborations with JNFLS-China team
We noticed that the fluorescence value in treatment group was higher than the positive control group in JNFLS-China high school team's project. To explore the potential cause, we advised them to use Flow Cytometer (FCM) to gather data. And we helped them design the protocol of experiment in details.

Collaborations with SCU-China team
    In this year, we co-expressed Cry and Cyt proteins by 2A-peptide expression system. Considering the effect of amino acids residues to the toxicity after cleavage, SCU-China team helped us to predict the potential effect by Swiss-Model.

Collaborations with BNU-China team
It's essential for us to get accurate growth condition of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the natural environment to keep the concentration of toxin at a lethal level. But in fact, it is almost impossible to test concentration anywhere due to the lack of equipment and skills. Therefore, building the growth model can help determine the amount of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii they should use and when they need to add more. To build an accurate growth model, BNU-China team members who have much experience in the mathematics helped us to achieve it. 
Moreover, BNU- China team wanted to detect paclitaxel by utilizing microtubule which expressed in E. Coli. Microtubule is assembled by α-subunit and β-subunit in eukaryotes. But E. Coli is a genus of prokaryote. So it is essential to justify whether microtubule assembled successfully or not in E. Coli. If microtubule assembled successfully, α-subunit and β-subunit will have interaction in E. Coli. To prove it, we used Co-Immunoprecipitation (CoIp) to confirm their interaction. If you are interested in the details, you can visit this link: https://2016.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Experiments
 
 
 
Collaborations with ZJU-China team
     During the G20 Summit held in Hangzhou, we shared our labs with them. And ZJU-China team helped us to finish the incomplete toxicity model which was helpful for us to figure out the demo. If you are interested in the details, you can visit this link:https://2016.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Model/Growth_Model         
 
 
Collaborations with NEU-China team
     After the members of NEU-China team finished our survey about mosquitoes, they came to take an interest in our project. After a brief talk, they thought that they can helped us to test the level of gene expression of Hsp70A-Rbc S2 Promoter. Meanwhile, we helped them to test the expression of tCas9-CIBN and got the accurate data about the induced concentration of arabinose.

Collaborations with ShanghaiTechChina_B team
  We helped ShanghaiTechChina_B team to construct parts when they were in a narrow schedule. Meanwhile, they helped us to purify the toxin proteins by his tag. If you are interested in the details, you can visit this link:https://2016.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Experiments
Collaborations with SDSZ_China team
    SDSZ_China team helped us to get some important response to our handbook from Cote dlvoire internationally students. Their responses were very essential for us because they offered the real conditions in West Africa. His gave us feedback as following. 1. You can add more information about the geographical distribution of different types of mosquitos that can carry different kinds of diseases, so that people from different parts of the tropical and subtropical areas can have a better understanding of what they need to be worried about. 2. I think most people actually living in the regions where mosquitos-carried diseases are prevalent already know the symptoms and basic ways to prevent them. Maybe your handbook will be more useful to tourists. So you can consider contacting local travel agencies and distributing your brochures to them.
 
 
 
Collaborations with SCUT-China_A team
SCUT-China_A team members are troubled with the mosquitoes in Guangzhou. Because of it, they gave us some practical suggestions about how to use our products in the natural environment. They provided some environment parameters which are typical factors in the areas which are suitable for mosquitoes living. Based on their ideas and model, we tried to figure out the demo about how to make use of our products to control mosquitoes in the natural environment.
