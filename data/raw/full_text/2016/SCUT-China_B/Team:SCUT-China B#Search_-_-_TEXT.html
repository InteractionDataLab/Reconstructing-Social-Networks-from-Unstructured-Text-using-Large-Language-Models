Hospice care focuses on the last few months or weeks of patients’ life providing holistic nursing, alleviative treatment and psychological help to relive their suffering physically and mentally, improve their quality of life in their last time. Nowadays health care system in China doesn’t pay much attention on the need of terminal patients and hospice care could be a supplement in this aspect. As our society is getting old hospice care would certainly become more and more in need. Unfortunately hospice care is amid controversy and facing problems. Some of the hospices have few patients coming for the service and have to run in debt. We need to know the controversial ideas of the public towards hospice care and the problem existing if we want a better development of it. So we conducted this survey.
Situation of our sample:
243 people accepted our survey
55.1% of them were male while 44.9% of them were female
216 of them had social insurance
Most of them had high school education background or above.
Result：
52.7% of those we surveyed believed that hospice care consists daily nursing. 75.3% of them agreed that it has psychological care. 28.8% of them took medical care as part of hospice care and 40.8% of them think hospice care included pain control. Not surprisingly 15.6 of those we surveyed had no idea about the content of hospice care. We noticed that those who found hospice care unacceptable didn’t take medical care as part of hospice care.
From the survey we founded that lack of knowledge about hospice care was the main impediment to it development. Hospice care needs to provide service through different methods like establishing special medical institutes for hospice care, setting up hospice department in hospitals or providing hospice service at patients’ home. Psychological and daily nursing gained most attention in the survey so these two aspects should be focused in developing hospice care.
The good cause still needs promotion so that more people would know and accept the concept. Though it needs much investment from the society but hospice care lighten the economic burden on terminal patients and save money of social insurance for patients who are hopeful to be cured.
