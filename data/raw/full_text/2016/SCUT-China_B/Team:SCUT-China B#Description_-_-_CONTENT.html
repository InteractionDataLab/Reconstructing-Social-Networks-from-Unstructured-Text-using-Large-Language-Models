So, it occurs to us, why not let the cancer cells to apoptosis themselves? 
We learned that we can activate a certain gene or inhibit a certain gene, both are able to cause series of changes in cells, ending up in apoptosis. What’s more, gene regulation therapy makes it easier for our therapy to “recognize” the cancer cells from normal cells. Just like a switch, the apoptosis system will only be activated when the plasmid recognizes that this is a cancer cell. There are differences between cancer cells and normal cells and we take advantage of that, so design our plasmid in a certain way, making it able decide whether it is a cancer cell needed to go apoptosis or it is a normal cell and leave it alone.
