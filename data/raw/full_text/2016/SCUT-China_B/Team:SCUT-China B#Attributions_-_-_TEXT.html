The team:
he student team of our project consists of 15 undergraduates from School of Bioscience and Bioengineering, School of Mathematics, School of Economy and Commerce, School of Design, School of Software Engineering and School of Materials Science and Engineering of SCUT and a high school student from The Affiliated High School of SCNU. We are in different characteristics and talented in different aspects. We gathered together for a project of Innovation Fund of SCUT and that was how team SCUT-WE established which finally became team SCUT-China-B for iGEM as you can see here.
The project:
In November 2015 we visited the tutor of one of our teammates, Professor Pan Li. During the visit we learnt about a frontier technology: CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats)/ Cas9. It interested us a lot so we decided to study it deeper. A member of our team had a relative who had once suffered from lung cancer which made her want to do something for lung cancer treatment. As her wish we made adenocarcinoma of lung as the theme of our project at last. Under guidance of Associate Professor Ling Fei and Tutor Huang Lizhen we began to refer literature and attend seminars and this was the beginning of our journey of iGEM.
