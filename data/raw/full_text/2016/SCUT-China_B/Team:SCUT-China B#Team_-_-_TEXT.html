    I served as a student instructor, providing guidance and supervision on education and student life matters for the students (class 2008, 2012) in Biotechnology Undergraduate Program, Department of Bioscience and Bioengineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, 2011 – present.
    Zongchao Mo participated in the iGEM competition in 2015 and he chooses to be an advisor this year. He is now a research assistant in BGI Shenzhen, China (Beijing Genomics Institute), one of the biggest genomic institutes around the world. Now, he is doing bioinformatics research here and focusing on the cancer genomics. Additionally, He is making preparation for doing further research in some excellent cancer research teams in USA in the next three years.

    Guorui Zhong,PhD student, Major in Biochemistry and molecular biology. Research interest are metabonomics and toxicology. As an instructor of the team SCUT-CHINA_B , responsible for providing guidance for experiment, like Molecular cloning, western Blot, real-time PCR, and cell culture.
    Junying Su, an advisor of the team, is now a senior student majoring in biotechnology. He loves biology and he’s fond of scientific research. Synthetic Biology and Neuroscience are his favourite field in biology. He has participated in iGEM competition for twice and has some experiences on the competition. During the competition, he was mainly responsible for the work of mathematical modelling in his team. Design concept of Synthetic Biology gives him the thought that the behaviours of cells and bio-molecules can be calculated, predicted and reprogrammed. Therefore, he will devote to predicting the activities of brain with mathematical modelling method.
