We are in different characteristics and talented in different aspects. We gathered together for a project of Innovation Fund of SCUT and that was how team SCUT-WE established which finally became team SCUT-China-B for iGEM as you can see here.</P></DIV><DIV><P class="tit">The project:</P><P class="detail">In November 2015 we visited the tutor of one of our teammates, Professor Pan Li. During the visit we learnt about a frontier technology: CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats)/ Cas9. It interested us a lot so we decided to study it deeper. A member of our team had a relative who had once suffered from lung cancer which made her want to do something for lung cancer treatment. As her wish we made adenocarcinoma of lung as the theme of our project at last. Under guidance of Associate Professor Ling Fei and Tutor Huang Lizhen we began to refer literature and attend seminars and this was the beginning of our journey of iGEM.</P></DIV><DIV><P class="tit">Team members:</P></DIV><DIV><P class="detail">Team Leader—Haojian Li</P><P class="detail">1.Arrangement of daily routine; direction and ways of the project</P><P class="detail">2.Experiments about molecular construction and downstream detection</P><P class="detail">3.Contact with modeling group</P></DIV><DIV><P class="detail">Experiment group—Li Cheng</P><P class="detail">1.Design and operation of western blotting experiments</P><P class="detail">2.Common molecular experiments</P></DIV><DIV><P class="detail">Experiment group—Yanxia Yang</P><P class="detail">1.Experiments about transfection and RNA extraction</P><P class="detail">2.Contact with design group</P></DIV><DIV><P class="detail">Experiment group—Qian Liu</P><P class="detail">1.Experiments about cell culture and apoptosis</P><P class="detail">2.Assistance to design group</P></DIV><DIV><P class="detail">Experiment group—Fangkai Ye </P><P class="detail">1.Experiment about extraction and transformation of plasmid</P><P class="detail">2.Assistance in constructing bio bricks</P></DIV><DIV><P class="detail">Experiment group—Hongfang Meng </P><P class="detail">1.Experiments about cell culture and transfection</P><P class="detail">2.Assistance to molecular experiments</P></DIV><DIV><P class="detail">Experiment group—Chuwen Xiao </P><P class="detail">Referring literature; solving problems</P></DIV><DIV><P class="detail">Modeling group-Yunxin Tai </P><P class="detail">Mathematical modeling with software</P></DIV><DIV><P class="detail">Modeling group—Yimiao Sun </P><P class="detail"> Referring literature; mathematical modeling</P></DIV><DIV><P class="detail">Modeling group—Zihan Xiao </P><P class="detail">Referring literature; Search for mathematical model parameters</P></DIV><DIV><P class="detail">HP group—Ziyuan Lin </P><P class="detail">1.Direction of human practice; contact with organizations involved; arrangement of HP works</P><P class="detail">2.Contact with Finance Managing Office of School</P></DIV><DIV><P class="detail">HP group—Haosi Lin </P><P class="detail">1.Dealing with HP works</P><P class="detail">2.Translation of wiki of HP</P></DIV><DIV><P class="detail">Design group—Xiaoyin Peng </P><P class="detail">1.Design and layout of wiki</P><P class="detail">2.Design of team logo and uniform</P></DIV><DIV><P class="detail">Design group—Jie Xiao </P><P class="detail">1.Design and decoration of PPT</P><P class="detail">2.Biological pattern formation</P></DIV><DIV><P class="detail">Design group—Yuhan Song </P><P class="detail">Design of team poster</P></DIV><DIV><P class="detail">Webpage code group—Yongji Li </P><P class="detail">Code generation of wiki; perfection of web page</P></DIV><DIV><P class="tit">About advisors</P><P class="detail">We thank our senior fellow Mo Zongchao from team iGEM 2015 SCUT-China for his help and advice for the project and human practice.
