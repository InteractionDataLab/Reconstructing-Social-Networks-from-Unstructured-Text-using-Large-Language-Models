K1946000
Basic
ChnR: This part codes for ChnR protein which is a Xyls/AraC-type transcriptional activator from Acinetobacter sp. It responds to the presence of cyclohexanone by inducing expression of ChnB protein.
942
K1946001
Basic
pChnB: This part is the region starting from 537bp upstream of ChnB to its start codon from Acinetobacter sp. cyclohenol gene cluster. pChnB is activated by ChnR (K1946000) in the presence of cyclohexanone.
537
K1946002
Basic
sgRNA targeting LacI: This part has a sgRNA targeting lacI. It also has 5' and 3' ribozyme which cleave the RNA molecule with self catalysis so that any sequence can be added to 5' or 3' to this part without preventing Cas9 binding and its activity.
205
K1946005
Basic
XylR: This part codes for the transcriptional regulatory protein XylR from Pseudomonas putida. It activates the TOL plasmid xyl operons in the presence of toluene, m-, p- and o-xylene.
1701
K1946006
Basic
pu: pu promoter drives transcription of the upper operon of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 TOL plasmid for degradation of toluene and xylenes. pu is activated by the activator protein XylR (BBa_K1946005) in the presence of toluene and xylenes.

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page.
