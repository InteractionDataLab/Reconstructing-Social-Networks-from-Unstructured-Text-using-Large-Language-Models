According to the most of our team members, human practices are one of the most productive and enjoyable sides of our iGEM adventure. We did not limit ourselves with only one activity, instead we have organized different activities to inform people about synthetic biology, to reach students to talk about iGEM, to increase awareness of breast cancer and to introduce our team and project. In the end of Spring 2016, we visited Bilkent High School and we attended a science fair organized by Doğa Collage. We have reached at least 100 students from high school and 450 students from elementary collage. Considering their background knowledge, we explained the basics of central dogma and how we can engineer bacteria and talk about synthetic biology which was a new field for most of them and gave some examples to show the potential of synthetic biology. During both presentations, we did not only introduce iGEM to students but also underlined the presence of high school division which they could participate in. We have tried to inspire and encourage them to think about a problem in a solution-oriented way and to come up with ideas for doing science which is sol valuable especially in Turkey. At the end of the presentations, we had some time to answer their interesting and challenging questions and to exhibit some samples that one could come across a lot in synthetic biology laboratory. Petri dish onto which the name of their schools was written attracted their attention most. The most motivating thing for us was an e-mail coming from one of those students a few day after the event stating that they had an idea for a project and asking if it was applicable and whether we could help them. It seems that we brought at least one enthusiastic team to iGEM high school division. We believe that we will be in contact with them soon.
QUESTIONNAIRE
We prepared a questionnaire about early diagnosis of breast cancer and utility of a non-invasive diagnostic kit for women. According to the answers of the attandants, there is an underestimation of the importance of early diagnosis due to expense and invasiveness of diagnosis mehods. The results of the questionnaire are listed below.
