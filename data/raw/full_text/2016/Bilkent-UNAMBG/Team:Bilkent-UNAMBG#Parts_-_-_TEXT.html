K1946000
Basic
ChnR: This part codes for ChnR protein which is a Xyls/AraC-type transcriptional activator from Acinetobacter sp. It responds to the presence of cyclohexanone by inducing expression of ChnB protein.
942
K1946001
Basic
pChnB: This part is the region starting from 537bp upstream of ChnB to its start codon from Acinetobacter sp. cyclohenol gene cluster. pChnB is activated by ChnR (K1946000) in the presence of cyclohexanone.
537
K1946002
Basic
sgRNA targeting LacI: This part has a sgRNA targeting lacI. It also has 5' and 3' ribozyme which cleave the RNA molecule with self catalysis so that any sequence can be added to 5' or 3' to this part without preventing Cas9 binding and its activity.
205
K1946003
Basic
Cycloxehanone Sensor: This part consists codon optimised ChnR (BBa_K1946000) from acinetobacter sp. operated by Tet operator and promoter region of ChnB (BBa_K1946001) followed by sfGFP (BBa_I746916). It is shown that ChnR activates ChnB protein in the presence of cyclohexanone. This sensor generates sfGFP in the presence of cyclohexanone.
2535
K1946004
Basic
Toluene/Xylene Sensor: This part responds to the presence of toluene, m-, p- or o-xylenes and produces a green fluorescent signal. The transcriptional regulatory protein XylR recognizes these organic molecules and activates pu promoter which in turn will lead to the synthesis of sfGFP.
3087
K1946005
Basic
XylR: This part codes for the transcriptional regulatory protein XylR from Pseudomonas putida. It activates the TOL plasmid xyl operons in the presence of toluene, m-, p- and o-xylene.
1701
K1946006
Basic
pu: pu promoter drives transcription of the upper operon of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 TOL plasmid for degradation of toluene and xylenes. pu is activated by the activator protein XylR (BBa_K1946005) in the presence of toluene and xylenes.
