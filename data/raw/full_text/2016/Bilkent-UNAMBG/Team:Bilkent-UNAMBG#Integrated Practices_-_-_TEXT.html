We have organized a Synthetic Biology Day which was held on 15th of October. In addition to presentations of our project and ITUâ€™s, a team that we collaborated with, we invited four speakers to talk about Synthetic Biology. Wed distributed a questionnaire to analyse awareness on breast cancer and ask people if they would prefer a non-invasive and cheap diagnostic tool over traditional techniques. We had time in the end to meet our guests, talk face to face and answer their questions. During presentation, we talked about the survival rates ranged between 90-100% and showed people that there is an underestimation of the importance of early diagnosis. Seeing what the general population feels about diagnostic methods will influence how we will proceed with the development of our kit.
