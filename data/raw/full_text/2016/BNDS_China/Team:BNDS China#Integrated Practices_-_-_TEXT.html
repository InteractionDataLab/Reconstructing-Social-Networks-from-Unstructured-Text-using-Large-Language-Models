Integrated Practices
We are interested in the further affects of our project that we would like to integrate the later feedback into our workflow. Our main goal is to improve people’s life, so it is so important for us to include the user’s comments. We want to know whether they like our softener or not, and thus we can further develop more efficient hard water softener version 2.0 or 3.0.
