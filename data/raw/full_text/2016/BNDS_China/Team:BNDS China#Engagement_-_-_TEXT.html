Engagement
We are a high school students’ team. Participating in the iGEM competition already offers us a chance to use educational tools, the micro-Biology lab, and other lab tools. We encounter with many concepts and facilitates that we never used them before, so it’s innovation. Also, due to the fact that we made a crowdfunding mainly in our school to support our project, many other students and teachers are interested in our project and come over to see our experiments. It’s the best way to spark a new scientific curiosity that many students are surprised by out high academic skills and become interested in this micro-Biology field. We believe we influence people outside the lab to think about our water softening process and engage in this field more.
