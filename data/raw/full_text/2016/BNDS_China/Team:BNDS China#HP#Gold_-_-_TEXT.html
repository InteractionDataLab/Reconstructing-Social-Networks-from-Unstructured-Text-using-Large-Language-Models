Human Practice - Gold
We’ve always think our project in the social and environmental context. As the two impacts listed on the previous page, we want to produce the cheap and popular hard water softener corresponding to the society’s need. We choose the topic “hard water softener” because the hard water is a hot issue right now, and we use bacteria for its economic and multiple functions.
