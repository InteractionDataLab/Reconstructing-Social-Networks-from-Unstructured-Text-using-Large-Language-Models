About our project:
Our project is to design a bacterial hard water softener, which makes calcium ions flow from hard water into bacteria by using a calcium ion channel protein. Hard water is defined as having a concentration of calcium ion over 60mg/L. Hard water has brought so many problems to our daily life. There are existing methods for hard water softening such as filters and using chemicals, but these methods are either too expensive or inefficient. Therefore, our project which uses cheap bacteria carrying calcium ion channel protein as the water softener is a worth trying.
