What makes a good iGEM’er? The capability to play with BioBricks like it was LEGO. As LEGO™ is a Danish company, and our team is Danish, it came more than natural to us. In this chapter you will find our parts, procedures, and safety considerations ensuring you from not hurting yourself while playing with our BioBricks.
If you want to reconstruct our project, then take a look at our Notebook and see how our project developed week-by-week. Here you will also be able to follow us through the good times and not so succesfull times. However, we have learned a lot through the project and have enjoyed each other's company.
Take a look around and see for yourself!
