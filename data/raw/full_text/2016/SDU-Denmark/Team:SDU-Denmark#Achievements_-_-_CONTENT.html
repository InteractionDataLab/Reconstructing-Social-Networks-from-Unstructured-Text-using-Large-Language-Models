<A target="blank" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Outreach">reaching out</A> to highschool students at different events, but we also managed to create videos to educate the Danish citizens about synthetic biology.

We <A target="blank" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Interview">talked to several experts</A> in order to develop new goals for the future perspective of our project and to expand our knowledge about the different sub elements. Among those are experts in the areas of therapeutic use of biodegradable plastic and experts in the use of antibiotics and bacteriocins as new antimicrobial components. Furthermore, we made a survey to one of the high schools we visited and used their feedback to improve our presentation. They also gave us new ideas for future development of our Bacto-Aid. Moreover, we talked to a nurse about their requirements for a patch like ours. Lastly, we made a survey to Danish companies that work with plastic production and investigated the possible interest in the use of plastic produced by bacteria.

We examined the <A target="blank" href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1149051">phaCAB BioBrick</A> created by <A title="Imperial College team 2013" href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College/PHB_production" target="_blank">Imperial College team 2013</A>. We characterized the relationship between the strength of the additional promoter and ribosomal binding site and the yield of plastic. In the process we created another phaCAB construct that appears to generate a higher yield of PHB. Furthermore, we characterized the effect of the <A target="blank" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1692020">pantothenate kinase II BioBrick</A> submitted by Imperial Collegeâs 2015 iGEM team on <I>E. coliâs</I> proteome.

Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept</B>
By producing bacteriocins and PHB from different BioBrick devices, we demonstrated a <A target="blank" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Proof">functional Proof of Concept</A>. Furthermore we have a <A target="blank" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2018050">BioBrick device (K2018050)</A> that secretes PHB.</LI><LI><B>Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab</B>
Through MIC tests of our bacteriocins, we showed their effect towards different human pathogens that are particularly complicated to treat due to the rising resistance problem. These tests suggested the potential of these bacteriocins to be used in therapeutic practice. We have improved the production platform of PHB by introducing a secretion system for PHB in <I>E. coli</I>. Using PHB produced with our construct, we <A target="blank" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Proof">3D printed</A> an actual product; an implant prototype of the human mandible (jaw). This illustrated that PHB produced in bacteria can be used for real world applications.

We held several talks and presentations. The audiences varied from small children at <A target="blank" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Outreach">the Research day</A> at the University of Southern Denmark to professors in philosophy. We taught a lot and learned even more ourselves. One of our engagements was being teachers for a day: we educated two biotechnology classes at a local high school an entire day. We taught them about synthetic biology and made a laboratory exercise for them, which we supervised for. It was great fun. We also focused on taking a stand for <A target="blank" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Reproducibility">scientific reproduction</A>, which we did further research about. The biotechnology classes tried to reproduce some of our protocols, which were mostly successful.</P></LI><LI><B>Integrated Human practice</B><P>We talked to <A target="blank" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Integrated_Practices">several experts</A> in order to integrate new goals for the future perspective of our project and to expand our knowledge about the different sub elements. Among those are experts in the areas of therapeutic use of biodegradable plastic and experts in the use of antibiotics and bacteriocins as new antimicrobial components. We tried to integrate some of their ideas into our project in order to make our Bacto-Aid more realistic to commercialize. The interviews also reassured us, that we are dealing with a very essential problem. Furthermore, talking to the experts about PHB, we found a great interest regarding PHB as therapeutics, which we were unaware of. This expanded the potential uses of PHB in our project. This lead us to 3D print a life-size part of a jaw. </P><P>We talked to a nurse about their requirements for a patch like ours. This guided us regarding to which aspects we should focus on if hospitals are going to use our Bacto-Aid. Furthermore, we made a survey with one of the high schools we visited and used their feedback to improve the message. Lastly, we send out question forms to Danish plastic companies to investigate their possible interest in the use of plastic made by bacteria. They were very interested in our plastic, but today PHB is too expensive. We have therefore worked hard to optimize the production of PHB. </P></LI><LI><B>Best device</B><P>We created a <A target="blank" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2018050">BioBrick (K2018050) </A> that will help overcome the problems associated with extraction and production of PHB. The Biobrick allows the PHB producing <I>E. coli</I> to secrete internal PHB into the environment. The BioBrick utilizes the type 1 secretion pathway for hemolysin and tags PHB for secretion by fusing a part of hemolysin to the PHB-binding protein, phasin. The BioBrick has been shown to work in Top10/PanK-sec. The PHB secreting cells could enable optimal utilization of a continuous system for large scale PHB production.</P></LI><DIV id="sidewikimenu" class="menu_wrapper col-lg-2 col-lg-push-2 col-md-2 hidden-xs hidden-sm"><DIV class="collapsable_menu_control hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg hidden-xl">Menu</DIV><UL id="sideaccordion" class="accordion"><LI class="menu_item" id="side1"><A id="sideone" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark">Home</A></LI><LI class="menu_item" id="side2"><A id="sidetwo" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Introduction">Introduction</A></LI><LI><A id="team" href=" https://2016.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Team" hijax="">Team</A></LI><LI><A id="attributions" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Attributions">
