BBa_K2018022
This BioBrick contains the coding region of Phasin, a protein derived from R. eutropha. Phasin binds to and reduces the size of PHA granules, including PHB.
BBa_K2018023
BioBrick encodes a short hemolysin tag. This tag can be attached to other proteins for secretion through the hemolysin pathway.
BBa_K2018026
This BioBrick contains the native RBS for hemolysin B in R. eutropha. The brick  also contains some native DNA prior to the RBS.
BBa_K2018027
This BioBrick contains the coding region of hemolysin B. Hemolysin B is an ABC transporter, that secretes the toxin hemolysin.
BBa_K2018028
This BioBrick contains the native RBS for hemolysin D in R. eutropha. The brick  also contains some native DNA prior to the RBS.
BBa_K2018029
This BioBrick contains the coding region for hemolysin D, part of the inner membrane complex of the hemolysin type II secretion pathway.
BBa_K2018043
This BioBrick contains the sequence for the MaSp1 CD gene. This part is a monomer coding for the  dragline spider silk MaSp1 and is used for the technique called ICA. This specific part contains specific overhangs, which have sticky ends compatible with e.g. part K2018045 , K2018046 and K2018047 .
BBa_K2018044
This BioBrick contains the sequence for the MaSp2 CD gene. This part is a monomer coding for the dragline spider silk MaSp2 and is used for the technique called ICA. This specific part contains specific overhangs, which have sticky ends compatible with e.g. part K2018045 , K2018046 and K2018047 .
