BBa_K2018010
This part is a functional BioBrick containing the coding region of Laterosporulin, with promoter, RBS and terminator. Laterosporulin is a bacteriocin produced by Brevibacillus sp. strain, and exhibit a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against bacterias like: B. subtilis , S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa,  and L. monocytogenes.
BBa_K2018011
This BioBrick contains the coding region of, ThuricinS, a bacteriocin produced by Bacillus thuringiensis. ThuricinS targets a broad spectrum of pathogens, including Pseudonoas aeruginosa and Enterobactoer Cloacae which is often found in correlation to burn and wound infection.
BBa_K2018012
This BioBrick contains the coding region of LacticinQ, a bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis QU5 and has shown bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus Ma, Q., Yu, Z., Han, B., Wang, Q., & Zhang, R. (2012). Expression and Purification of Lacticin Q by Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Fusion in Escherichia coli. The Journal of Microbiology, 50(2), 326–331. http://doi.org/10.1007/s12275-012-1425-x. . It functions by forming large toroidal pores by distributing membrane lipid organization.
BBa_K2018014
This BioBrick contains the coding region of Laterosporulin-ThuricinS, which is a hybrid bacteriocin with Laterosporulin and ThuricinS that we have designed.
BBa_K2018015
This BioBrick contains the coding region of LacticinQ-LacticinZ, which is a hybrid bacteriocin with LacticinQ and LacticinZ that we have designed.
BBa_K2018019
This BioBrick contains the coding region of PyocinS5, a bacteriocin produced by a specific strain of P. aeruginosa and elicit its effect against other strains of P. aeruginosa. Pyocin causes the cell membrane of target cells to be permeable and thereby causing leakage of intracellular materials, which cause cell death Ling, H., Saeidi, N., Haji Rasouliha, B., & Wook Chang, M. (2010). A predicted S-type pyocin shows a bactericidal activity against clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates through membrane damage. FEBS Letters, 584, 3354–3358. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2010.06.021. .
BBa_K2018024
This BioBrick contains the coding region of our biofused phasin with a hemolysin A tag, so it is recognized for secretion by the type II hemolysin secretion pathway. This biobrick is designed to work with hemolysin B ( K2018027 ) and hemolysin D ( K2018029 ). This BioBrick will simply bid to PHA granules in the cytoplasm and reduce the size of these.
BBa_K2018030
This part secretes PHB from PHB producing cells.
