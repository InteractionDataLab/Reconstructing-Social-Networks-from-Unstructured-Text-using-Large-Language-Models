Study: Biomedicine
Mail: ashon14@student.sdu.dk
Astrid enjoys an active lifestyle and loves to travel. However, this is a problem because as she puts it: “I have the time, but not the money to travel as much as I want”.  She likes iGEM for the experiments and the ping-pong discussions within the team. Lastly she is fond of baking but thinks that the best part of baking is when others enjoy it. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row team"><DIV class="col-sm-7 col-sm-push-1"><H5>The Wiki Witch</H5><P class="underh5">Name: Birka Jensen

Birka is a fire breathing, number crunching, keyboard typing, soccer playing, Wiki-coding mathematician. She lives with her dog, cat and her lovely wife to whom she got married this summer - The iGEM team was there! Birka's number one favorite activity is performing fireshows with <A target="blank" href="http://www.cirkussort.dk/">Cirkus Sort</A>.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row team"><DIV class="col-sm-7 col-sm-push-1"><H5>The Clone Commander</H5><P class="underh5">Name: Brian Baltzar
Study: Biomedicine
Mail: brbal14@student.sdu.dk
Brian lives with his girlfriend and their three year old son. Brian hopes that he can someday make a significant contribution on the road to new treatments against antimicrobial resistance. He joined iGEM because he wanted to experience doing ‘real’ research - both the ups and the downs.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row team"><DIV class="col-sm-7 col-sm-push-1"><H5>The Planner</H5><P class="underh5">Name: Cathrine Christensen
Study: Biomedicine
Mail: catch14@student.sdu.dk
Cathrine is a real planner and to challenge the unknown she chose to join the iGEM team this year. With her drive and ambition to gain new knowledge, she hopes to get a glimpse of what her future might bring.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row team"><DIV class="col-sm-7 col-sm-push-1"><H5>Mr. Goldilocks</H5><P class="underh5">Name: Jakob Rønning
Study: Biology
Mail: jroen14@student.sdu.dk
Jakob has long hair and he likes to brush his hair whenever it is possible. The huge potential in gene manipulation inspired Jakob and gave him a desire to know more about synthetic biology through iGEM. After all, he loves to be in a field of science that has such a big potential to remodel our way of life.

Study: Biomedicine
Mail: jovej14@student.sdu.dk
Joel is the man in colorful clothes and with a big grin on his face. He has a strong intuitive grasp of natural science, which made iGEM a good opportunity for him to gain practical lab experience and to test his abilities. As a kid he nicknamed himself “Super Joel”. However, as his middle name is Mario, soon his class would chant “Super Mario” whenever Joel was at the blackboard.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row team"><DIV class="col-sm-7 col-sm-push-1"><H5>The Movie Star</H5><P class="underh5">Name: Mathilde Nygaard
Study: Medicine
Mail: manyg14@student.sdu.dk
Mathilde has lived most of her life in France and moved back to Denmark only three years ago. iGEM was the opportunity to try out the world of research. Her most fun experience in iGEM has been the many roadtrips. The group has always been cheering, joyful, and ready to sing along in the car.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row team"><DIV class="col-sm-7 col-sm-push-1"><H5>The ICA Master</H5><P class="underh5">Name: Nete Bækgaard
Study: Chemical Engineering
Mail: nebae12@student.sdu.dk
Nete is the team's engineer and she therefore knows a thing or two about taking a project from the research state to the industrial scale. iGEM has taught Nete to be more patient because it can take a long time before you succeed with experiments. But when you do, it is the best feeling!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row team"><DIV class="col-sm-7 col-sm-push-1"><H5>The Klutz</H5><P class="underh5">Name: Pernille Rasmussen
Study: Biomedicine
Mail: prasm14@student.sdu.dk
Pernille does her part in the laboratory by ensuring everybody gets a whole lot of experience, mostly because of Pernilles clumsiness, since things might have to be done twice. She chose to join iGEM for the great laboratory experience and to get a glimpse of how life might be after graduation.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row team"><DIV class="col-sm-7 col-sm-push-1"><H5>Thinker Bell</H5><P class="underh5">Name: Rikke Bentzon
Study: Philosophy &amp; Biology
Mail: rbent14@student.sdu.dk
Rikke is interested in bioethics, the epistemology of knowledge and philosophy of science. She joined iGEM so she could get the opportunity to work in a labcoat instead of sitting with her reading glasses. Rikke loves to read - at the moment she has more than 400 books in her apartment. Apart from that, she drinks more coffee than the rest of the iGEM team combined.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row team"><DIV class="col-sm-7 col-sm-push-1"><H5>Twisty Professor</H5><P class="underh5">Name: Rune Øbo
Study: Biomedicine
Mail: ruubo14@student.sdu.dk
Rune is our second redhaired team member. He can always twist a scientific explanation so the receiver understands it. Rune is always full of energy when he's not hungry; if so, feed him a Snickers. He learned through iGEM that communication is an important skill. Also, he once biked 1 km to catch a Bulbasaur in Pokémon GO while a PCR was running.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row team"><DIV class="col-sm-7 col-sm-push-1"><H5>PCR-King Of The World</H5><P class="underh5">Name: Viktor Mebus
Study: Biology
Mail: vimeb13@student.sdu.dk
Meet Viktor, a biologist who would seem to only know the nature of bird calls, so it was a great surprise when he showed his true value. For Viktor iGEM was a way to finally harvest the glory that he so truly deserved. “Heavy lies the crown” they say and Viktor has learned that being the king of PCR means that he is now obligated to do every last bit of every PCR reaction to the end of time.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="sidewikimenu" class="menu_wrapper col-lg-2 col-lg-push-2 col-md-2 hidden-xs hidden-sm"><DIV class="collapsable_menu_control hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg hidden-xl">Menu</DIV><UL id="sideaccordion" class="accordion"><LI class="menu_item" id="side1"><A id="sideone" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark">Home</A></LI><LI class="menu_item" id="side2"><A id="sidetwo" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Introduction">Introduction</A></LI><LI><A id="team" href=" https://2016.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Team" hijax="">Team</A></LI><LI><A id="attributions" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Attributions">
