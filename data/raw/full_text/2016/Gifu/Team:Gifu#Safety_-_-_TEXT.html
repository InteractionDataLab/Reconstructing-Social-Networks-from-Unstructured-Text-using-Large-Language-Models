What is your chassis organism?
E. coli K-12 JM109
B. subtilis
Schizosaccharomyces pombe
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Do you plan to experiment with any other organisms, besides your chassis?
We use Bacillus subtilis(NBRC 13719), Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
We will extract DNA from S. pombe to clone the protein we want.
We will introduce several genes into E. coli K-12.
How will your project work?
We would like to degrade uric acid to urea by utilizing Purine metabolism pathway. To decompose uric acid,             we have to express five enzymes. A series of enzymes are uricase, HIU hydrolase, OHCU decarboxylase,            allantoinase, and alantoicase. We will clone these enzyme-coding genes and express them in Escherichia coli.
What risks does your project pose at the laboratory stage?
What actions are you taking to reduce those risks?
Candida utilis have a high risk to human . So, we use Bacillus subtilis and Schizosaccharomyces pombe.             Because, they have the same pathway of purine degratation as Candida utilis.
How would your project be used in the real world?
Only in the lab.
We will make enzyme from E. coli only in the lab.
What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use?
What future work might you do to reduce those risks?
If people use a large amount of our products, a large amount of Urea occurs.             A large amount of urea may be utilized by the bacteria and cause water pollution in the natural world .            So, we must determine of a standard proper quantity .

Our safety activity
 We sometimes discussed our safety with our teachers. It has been carried out from the generation of senior.             It is becoming the tradition of iGEM Gifu.
 This year, we learn about "Law Concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living                             Modified Organisms" and Training session that our university conduct for student can Safely do experiments. Law Concerning the Conservation and              Sustainable Use of     Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms is a law that our country has ratified for                Biodiversity.
 In japan the people who conduct genetic modification experiment must know this law. If we don’t learn this law ,we can’t             conduct genetic modification experiment. We participate training session that our university conduct for student, we can learn             basic safety in experiment. We can check important points to  conduct safety experiment by the session.
