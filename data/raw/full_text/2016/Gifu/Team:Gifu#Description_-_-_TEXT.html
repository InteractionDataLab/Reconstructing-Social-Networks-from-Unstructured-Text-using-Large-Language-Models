DESCRIPTION
 Birds’ excrement consists mainly of uric acid. Uric acid is really insoluble material. Sometimes this insolubility causes a problem of forest dieback. Basically this kind of materials are flown down by rainwater. Gifu prefecture is known for cormorant fishing on the Nagara river. Cormorants is one of the birds which cause the problem of standing decay. We would like to degrade uric acid to urea by utilizing Purine metabolism pathway to solve this problem. To decompose uric acid, we have to express five enzymes. A series of enzymes are uricase, HIU hydrolase, OHCU decarboxylase, allantoinase and allantoicase. We will clone these enzyme-encoding genes and express in Escherichia coli.
