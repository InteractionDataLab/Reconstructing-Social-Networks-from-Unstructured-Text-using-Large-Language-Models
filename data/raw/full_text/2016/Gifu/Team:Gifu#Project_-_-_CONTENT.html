. </P><H3 id="background">Back Ground</H3><P> In Gifu prefecture, Cormorant Fishing on the Nagara river (Ukai) is one of the most summer sights in Japan. Ukai is a traditional night fishing method in which an &quot;usho&quot;(Cormorant Fishing Master) and &quot;u&quot;(cormorant birds) work together to fish by the flames of Kagari-bi (fishing fire lanterns) reflecting on the dark surface of the river, with Mt Kinka and lofty Gifu Castle on its summit providing a dramatic backdrop to the scenery. Ukai has about 1,300 years of history. Now, it is popular as a tourism industry and a special world agricultural culture. On the other hand, damage caused by the cormorant droppings at the riverside is serious in Japan. The damage that we focus on is dieback of trees. In woods on the riverside inhabited by cormorant, some leaves are stained with their droppings and interfered with photosynthesis. Birds’ excrement consists mainly of uric acid which is hardly soluble material. So trees cannot get adequate nutrition and die back. Cormorant is carnivorous animal, and the amount of uric acid in their droppings are larger than that of uric acid in other birds’ droppings. Also, cormorant flocks together and they tend to drop their excrement around their nests. In the city, deterioration of the landscape caused by birds’ droppings is also a serious problem. The droppings fell on cars and window glasses cause corrosion if it is left for a long time. Moreover, acidity of droppings leads to decaying of bridge, highway and signs which may cause serious accidents. So, we plan to solve these problems by expression of birds’ &quot;dropping cleanerase&quot; and degrading uric acid.</P><H3 id="purine">Purine metabolism</H3><P>Purine metabolism is a pathway of synthesizing and degrading purines. To breakdown uric acid into urea, five enzymes, Uricase, HIU hydrolase, OHCU decarboxylase, Allantoinase and Allantoicase are needed. This pathway is shown in Figure.1. The production of allantoin is preceded by two additional distinct unstable intermediate. However, HIU is spontaneously decomposed into OHCU and subsequently into racemic allantoin. So, we decided to reproduce the essential part of this pathway shown in Figure.2 <I>in vitro</I>. Enzymatic activity is required to degrade the intermediate products of purine metabolism. Ammonia, the final product of purine metabolism, is the most assimilated nitrogen source of most fungi and bacteria. </P><P>As template genes of Uricase, Allantoinase and Allantoicase, we used four microorganisms. Here, we mention why we used these microorganisms and characteristics. </P><P><I>B. subtilis</I> has eight genes driving uric acid degradation. These genes are located in a cluster with the exception for the gene encoding allantoin permease. <I>B. subtilis</I> can degrade all of five intermediates of uric degradation described above.</P><P>According to James and Rudolf(1984), wild type <I>S. pombe</I> is capable of degrading uric acid and allantoin. They confirmed that Uricase, Allantoinase and Allantoicase activities of each mutant are less than those of wild type. </P><P><I>S. cerevisiae</I> has the DAL gene cluster and is good at utilization of allantoin. So, <I>S. ceresisiae</I> uses allantoin as nitrogen source. However, it lacks the gene encoding oxygen-comsuming Uricase and is low-growth with uric acid. </P><P>In kegg pathway of purine metabolism in <I>E. coli</I>, it has HIU hydrolase and Allantoinase. It is high-growth with allantoin. Furthermore, <I>E. coli</I> has a special anaerobic pathway to decompose allantoin into urea. This pathway doesn’t need Allantoicase. </P><P>We performed growth test in minimal media containing purines of <I>E. coli</I>, <I>B. subtilis</I>, <I>S.cerevisiae</I> to confirm the existence of the target gene. The result is shown in <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Gifu/Project#results">Fig.9, Fig.10 and Fig.13</A>.</P><B>Figure.1 </B><B>Figure.2 </B><H3 id="experiments">Experiments</H3><H4>Growth test in minimal media</H4><P><I>E. coli</I> culture was grown in LB liquid at 37℃ overnight with shaking, <I>B. subtilis</I> culture was grown in LB liquid at 30℃, <I>S. pombe</I> culture and <I>S. cerevisiae</I> were grown in YPD liquid at 30℃ in advance.

The marker show the point, 200 kDa, 116.2 kDa, 66.2 kDa, 45.0 kDa, 31 kDa, 21 kDa
 According to the molecular weight (56.5 kDa) and comparison with negative control (lane 9 and 10), the strong band (red circle, lane 3 and 4) were predicted as uricase. The strongest band of lane 6 (less than 31 kDa) was not thought as uricase because of the difference from correct molecular weight (38.7 kDa).
In addition, we tried　the purification by His-tag, only to fail (no purification product was seen) because that uricase from <I>B. subtilis</I> hardly dissolve in PBS buffer we used (shown above Figure)

(<A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Gifu/Protocol">Protocols</A>)The result of absorbance change is shown in Fig.15.

    <H3>Discussion</H3><H4>Uricase of <I>B. subtilis</I></H4><P>In this project, we assayed mainly device <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2158004">BBa_ K2158004</A>. In SDS-PAGE experiment, there is a high possibility that Uricase of <I>B. subtilis </I>was synthesized by the recombinant <I>E. coli</I>. However, in the growth test, the recombinant <I>E. coli </I>didn’t grow well with uric acid. We think IPTG didn’t control lactose operon efficiently and the amount of the expressed enzyme was not enough to grow in the medium. In determination of the recombinant Uricase, the result shows the possibility of expressed functional protein catalyze uric acid to allantoin. So, it is not clear that this protein has the function. This protein should be analyzed particularly.</P><H4>Allantoinase and Allantoicase</H4><P>We couldn’t synthesize Allantoinase and Allantoicase. In SDS-PAGE, We confirmed protein that has small molecular weight were expressed instead of Allantoicase.

(Basic part, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2158003">BBa_K2158003</A> was cloned successfully.) So, we concluded the expressed Allantoicase didn't have appropriate function to degrade allantoic acid. In case of Allantoinase, we couldn’t construct the device accurately. </P><H4>Uricase of <I>S. pombe</I></H4><P>We ligated BBa_J04500, BBa_K2158002 and BBa_B0015 and tried to make a composite part. However, BBa_B0015 was not included in the plasmid.

The absorbance peak of protein is at 280 nm. So, the absorbance of experimental plots is generally higher than that of negative control.</P><H3 id="modeling">Modeling</H3><P><B>  Abstract</B> Our goal of this project is to solve problems caused by birds’ droppings with genetically engineered <I>E. coli.</I> To acheive this goal, we manufactured <I>E. coli</I> that synthesizes uricase, which catalyzes uric acid to urea. Therefore, we are interested in &quot;How fast can our <I>E. coli</I> process uric acid theoretically?&quot; We analyzed data obtained from the experiment and calculated theoretically maximum rate of processing uric acid.</P><P><B>  Method</B> We made a differential equation which represents time evolution of concentration of uric acid. To making the equation, we used the Michaelis-Menten equation, which is widely used to estimate rate of enzyme reaction. The conversion from uric acid to allantoin is catalyzed by uricase. For this reason, the conversion rate of uric acid is described with the Michaelis-Menten equation. The equation we made is as follows.

d [uric acid] / dt = - V<SUB>max</SUB> * [uric acid] / (Km + [Uric acid])…(A)
([X] represents the concentration of a substance X.)

V<SUB>max</SUB> is the conversion rate of uric acid under the condition that the ratio of the amount of uric acid to that of uricase is sufficiently high. This parameter is proportional to the concentration of uricase. Then we put the proportionality constant as K<SUB>cat</SUB>.

Here, we estimated the two kinetic parameters Vmax and Km in the equation by fitting these parameters to a measurement result of the concentration change of uric acid in the reaction mixture. Besides, we used an algorithm called &quot;differential evolution&quot; in this parameter fitting. A tool which estimates and outputs Vmax and Km by entering the measurement results of the concentration change was developed. We attached the source code of this fitting tool below.</P>&lt;<A href="/File:T--Gifu--Uricase_tool.zip" title="File:T--Gifu--Uricase tool.zip">File:T--Gifu--Uricase tool.zip</A>&lt;&gt;

<P><B> result</B>
In the following data and description, the unit of concentration of any substances is ng/μL and the unit of time is minute.
First, we measured the change of concentration of uric acid in the reaction mixture. Uricase in this mixture was standard reagent. The result of the measurement is summerized in , <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Gifu/Project#results">Table.1 and Figure.11</A> .
Then, we inputted these data into the parameter fitting tool mentioned above. Output of the parameter fitting was as follows.

V<SUB>max</SUB> = 0.0083
Km = 0.045

Besides, this graph shows the result of parameter fitting. The blue curve means the fitted curve, and the red plots is the data obtained from the experiment.</P><P>
The concentration of uricase as a standard reagent was
[uricase] = 0.42ng/μL.
Using the definition of K<SUB>cat</SUB>, or
Vmax = Kcat*[uricase],
Kcat was calculated in the following way.
Kcat = Vmax/[uricase] = 0.0083/0.42 = 0.020.
Now two kinetic parameters which is independent of concentration of enzyme or substrate (Kcat and Km) were estimated.

Second, we conducted His-Link purification of protein and measured the absorbance at 280.0 nm to determine the concentration of uricase in the cell lysate. <I>E. coli</I> culture was sonicated to assay the enzyme. Uricase in this solution was synthesized by <I>E. coli</I> which we engineered. The result is below.

[uricase] = 156.0ng/μL

So Vmax of the producted uricase mixture was calculated in the following way.
V<SUB>max</SUB> = K<SUB>cat</SUB>*[uricase] = 0.020*156.0 = 3.1

We can conclude that the uricase mixture made with our engineered <I>E. coli</I> has an ability to process uric acid with theoretically maximum rate of 3.1ng/(μL*min).

</P><P><B> Discussion</B>
Accoding to our modeling, a large amount of Uricase may be needed to solve the problem of birds’ dropping. Highly-improved Uricase should be developed by biosynthesis.</P><H3 id="futurework">FUTURE WORKS</H3><P>This year, our purpose is to make it possible for<I> E. coli</I> to degrade urate and solve problems caused by birds’ dropping. So, we cloned genes of uricase, allantoinase and allantoicase into<I> E. coli</I> to assess production and activity of these three enzymes. We could extract genome from three kinds of bacteria, <I>B. subtilis</I>, <I>S.cerevisiae</I> and <I>S. pombe</I> and express three enzymes mentioned above.
Meanwhile, this year’s result is not enough to solve the pollution of droppings. Now, we have three plans to improve our project. 
Firstly, we have to do more accurate assay using the allantoinase-loss-strain of <I>E. coli</I>. <I>E. coli</I> has a gene of allantoinase, and we can consider the possibility of affecting assay.   Secondly, we think about the use of total synthesis. This year, we were going to use <I>Candida utilis</I>. However, <I>Candida utilis</I> has a high risk to human health. So, we used <I>B. subtilis</I> and <I>S. pombe</I> in place of that. They have the similar pathway of purine metabolism as  <I>Candida utilis </I>. However,  <I>Candida utilis </I> has the gene coded uricase which has high enzyme activity. If we use the gene coded uricase of  <I>Candida utilis </I>  by total synthesis, our project will improve more. Thirdly, each gene is cloned into <I>B. subtilis </I> instead of <I> E. coli .</I><I>B. subtilis </I> have a function of secreting protein outside a cell. We can utilize expressed enzymes without sonication.
