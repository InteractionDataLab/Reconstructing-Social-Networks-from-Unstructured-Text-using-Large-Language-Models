COLLABORATIONS
The 88th Annual Meeting of The Genetics Society of Japan
We joined The 88th Annual Meeting of The Genetics Society of Japan with iGEM Japan. In the meeting where Nagahama arranged,         we presented our project. Then we exchanged opinions. In the meeting, we were able to know advanced science and stimulated to study.         In the discussion, we got some pieces of advice from iGEM Japan. We had good time for our project.

ABOUT KELN
We worked in collaboration with Kyoto to improve KELN. Kyoto developed KELN, a software for supporting to easily make HTML table, and they kindly offered it to other teams. We actually used KELN to create wiki like Achievement , Protocol , Calendar , and InterLab . In that process, we realized some points to be improved and new potential to apply it to wider work area, so we gave Kyoto team feedbacks.
It't a really helpful software in saving times to create wiki for the small teams like us, so we wish this KELN to be more useful and help more iGEMers.
KELN is now available on https://github.com/iGEMKyoto/KELN/releases .
Discussions with members of UST_Beijing
One of our teammate visited University of Science and Technology Beijing. We had two purposes. One was to compare the rules that applied to the experiment of each country, and discuss its validity. The other was to deepen exchanges between teams by exchanging our opinions.
He received explanation about UST_Beijing’s project, the absorption rate of improvement of oral administration of traditional Chinese medicine there. He observed the animal experiment, too. In addition, he discussed the safety and the law relating to the gene recombination experiments with members of UST_Beijing. For preventing genetically modified organisms escape from laboratory, we picked up an accident which happened in Nagoya University last year, and exchanged opinions that could help each other with either research or outreach efforts.
Collaborate with Nagahama
Gifu and Nagahama held a meeting on September 21th. We wanted to exchange opinions for each project. Nagahama aimed at improving the parts which they made last year, for FLAVORATOR . They had difficulty in protein assay. So we suggested that to use His-tag for assaying protein.
We planned to do a lot of expression about some enzymes. But, we troubled about what E.coli doesn’t release enzymes. So we thought we have to break E.coli to get enzyme. Nagahama suggested that to refer to iGEM Kyoto 2012 project . Because the study was E.coli’s secretion systems. This advice helped us for our project.

A workshop of modeling
On August 16th, one of our teammate participated in a workshop of modeling. The workshop was held by the team UT-Tokyo and the team Tokyo_Tech . After the workshop, we exchanged our ideas and received a lot of advice about modeling We had a good time for our project.
Thank you for your all supports!!
Modeling support from UT-tokyo
Our modeling was performed with iGEM UT-tokyo. We really appreciate for the help!
