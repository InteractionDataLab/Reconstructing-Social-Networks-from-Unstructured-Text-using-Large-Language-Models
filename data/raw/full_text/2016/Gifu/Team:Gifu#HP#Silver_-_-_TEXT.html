Introduce iGEM for Ogakikita senior high school
 We were requested a presentation about the activity of iGEM Gifu by Ogakikita senior high school which is specified in the super global high school. So we introduced our activity to them. Our activity, iGEM, led us to create the chance which do some wide range activities. We received some questions about our usually activities, so we could have a time to evaluate our activities. And students might have desire to enter the university that they can do what they want to do.
