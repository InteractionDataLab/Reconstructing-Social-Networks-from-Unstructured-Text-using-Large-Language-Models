HisLink Spin Protein Purification
Materials to Be Supplied by the User
・Nuclease-Free Water
・rotor
・wide-bore pipette tips
・5M NaCl solution
・tabletop centrifuge
・1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes
Preparation of FastBreak™ Reagent/DNase I solution
1.Add 80 μL of Nuclease-Free Water to the vial of DNaseⅠ.
2.Mix completely to dissolve the powder.
3.Remove the DNase solution from the vial and add it to 1 mL of Nuclease-Free Water.
Mix well.
4.Mix 5.8 μL of the FastBreak™ Reagent and 64.2 μL of the DNase I solution.
Procedure of centrifugation
1.Pipet 700 μl of bacterial culture into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 70 μl of the FastBreak™ Reagent/DNase I solution.
2.Resuspend the resin and allow it to settle. Once the resin has settled, use a wide-bore pipette tip to transfer 75 μl of the HisLink™ Resin from the settled resin bed to the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. To successfully transfer resin, place the wide-bore pipette tip deep into the resin and pipet slowly to assure that a consistent amount of resin is drawn into the pipette. Allow the resin to resettle between each pipetting.
Note: We recommend optimizing the amount of HisLink™ Resin used for low- (<1 mg/ml) or high- (>1 mg/sample) expressing proteins. For low-expressing proteins, less resin should be used; similarly, for high-expressing proteins, more resin per sample can be used.
3.Incubate the sample and resin for 30 minutes, mixing frequently on a rotating platform or shaker to optimize binding.
4.Place a Spin Column onto a Collection Tube (or a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube). Use a wide-bore pipette tip to transfer the lysate and resin from the original 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube in Step 3 to the spin column. If resin remains in the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, add HisLink™ Binding/Wash Buffer to the tube, then transfer the buffer and remaining resin to the spin column.
5.Centrifuge the spin column with the collection tube for 5 seconds or until the liquid clears the spin column.
6.To save the flowthrough, remove the spin column from the collection tube and transfer the flowthrough from the collection tube to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Otherwise, discard the flowthrough.
7.Place the spin column back onto the collection tube. Add 500 μl of HisLink™ Binding/Wash Buffer to the spin column, then cap the spin column. Centrifuge for 5 seconds or until the Binding/Wash Buffer clears the spin column. Discard the flowthrough. Repeat for a total of two washes.
8.Take the spin column off the collection tube and wipe the base of the spin column with a clean absorbent paper towel to remove any excess HisLink™ Binding/Wash Buffer.
9.Place the spin column onto a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 200 μl of HisLink™ Elution Buffer. Cap the spin column and tap or flick it several times to resuspend the resin. Wait 3 minutes.
10.Centrifuge the spin column and microcentrifuge tube at 14,000rpm for 1 minute to collect the eluted protein.

Making a SDS-PAGE gel and Electrophpresis
1 Mix and shake reagents quickly to prepare the separation gel.
2 Construct a plate for electrophoresis.
3 Pour separation gel into a gap of the plate (until about 2 cm below a comb).
Note: Wipe a plate for electrophoresis with 70% ethanol.
Hold a plate for electrophoresis not to spill the gel.
4 Pour a proper quantity of Milli Q water into a gap of the plate and then incubate for an hour at room tempareture.
5 Mix and shake quickly reagents for stacking gel (except APS and TEMED).
6 Slant the gel plate and absorb multistoried Milli Q water.
7 Add APS and TEMED to the mixture. (step5)
8 Fill the gap of the plate with stacking gel and then insert the comb into the gap of the plate.
Note: Be careful not to generate bubbles in gel.
9 Take out the plate and gel together after stacking gel coagulates.
10 Put the plate and gel into a migration tank with the plate toward outside.
11 Pour 300 µL of electrophoresis buffer into a phoresis tank. Immerse the gel completely.
12 Apply 10 µL of the sample and 5 µL of a marker.
13 Electrophorese at 40 mA in the stacking gel until a pigment comes at the separation gel.
After that, electrophorese at 60 mA in the separation gel.
14 Stop electrophoresis and then collect the gel carefylly.
Note: Use tweezers.
15 Remove the buffer for electrophoresis and dye the separation gel with CBB.
16 Wash the gel plate and the electrophoretic tank with neutral detergent and rinse it steadily.
Staining with CBB
1 Put the gel into fixing solution.
2 Leave the gel on the shaker until a band is dyed yellow.
3 Remove the fixing solution and then put the gel into CBB dyeing liquid.
4 Wrap it and then heat it until it is almost boiling with a microwave oven.
5 Remove the wrap carefully and then let vapor out slowly.
6 Remove the CBB dyeing liquid and pour deionized water into a container carrying the gel. Put Kim wipe into the container.
7 Infiltrate deionized water into the gel for several tens of minutes. Transfer waste liquid into a tank.
Take a picture under UV light and then dry the gel and store it.
