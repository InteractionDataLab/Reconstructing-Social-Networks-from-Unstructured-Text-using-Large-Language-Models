Materials
・Birds’ dropping collected from Echizen city(Fig1)
・Uricase of candida sp. from wako
・50 mM Borate buffer containing 1 mM EDTA and detergent
・Enzyme solution (prepare a 0.0025 mg/ml Uricase solution by diluting with borate buffer)
Methods
1.Dissolve 0.0017g of birds’ dropping in 2.0 mL of borate buffer.
2.Add 0.5 mL of dH2O to the reaction mixture.
3.Preheat the mixture at 25℃
4.Add 0.5 mL of enzyme solution to the mixture.
5.Invubate the mixture and measure the absorbance at 290 nm continuously.
Results
The absorbance at 290 nm is over 2.0. So, the substrate is too much for added Uricase. In addition, birds’ excrement contains impurities. We can’t get valid values in this experiment.
