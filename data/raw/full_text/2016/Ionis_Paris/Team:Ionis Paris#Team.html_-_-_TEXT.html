THE TEAM
Team creation
Thanks to the team iGEM IONIS 2015, all students from our school were aware of the iGEM competition. This year iGEM IONIS team was created as the instigation of student from Sup’Biotech.  During our first brainstorming,  we had the idea of using bioluminescence as the reporter for pollutant detection and quantification. We wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field given by the IONIS education group. Thus, we came with the idea of realizing a new engineering systems for pollutants quantification by enclosing engineered bacteria into a drone.   The project set up, it was time for us to make the recruitment  according to the different aspects of our project. Therefore we recruited student specialized in Aeronautic for the drone conception, Computer Science for the drone control sytems, the realization of our wiki and our app ,  in Marketing to organized the European experience and lastly in Design to realize the project's graphic design.
For the first time in the history of the competition, 6 different schools from the IONIS Education Group met to create one team: iGEM IONIS.
