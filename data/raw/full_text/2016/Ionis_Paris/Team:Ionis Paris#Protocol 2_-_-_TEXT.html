Protocol 2
Protocol 2 : TAE preparation
Aim: Preparation of the buffer used for electrophoresis
Put 800mL of deionized water in the bottle along with the magnetic bar
Dissolve 48.5g of Tris base
Add 11.4 mL of glacial acetic acid
Add 20 mL of 0.5M EDTA or 3,7g of EDTA disodium salt
Add deionized water up to 1L
Shake the solution until it becomes homogeneous
Autoclave at 121 Celsius degrees for 15 to 30 minutes to sterilize
Store at room temperature
Be sure to dilute the buffer to 1:10 before us
NB : 1X buffer will contain approximatively 40 mM Tris, 20 mM acetic acid and 1 mM EDTA
Reagents
Tris base (Sigma-Aldrich)
Glacial acetic acid
(Sigma, ARK2183-1L)
0.5M EDTA (pH = 8.0)
(Sigma-Aldrich, EDS-100G)
Deionized water
Materials
1L glass bottle
Magnetic bar and stirrer
Weighing scale
Autoclave

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
