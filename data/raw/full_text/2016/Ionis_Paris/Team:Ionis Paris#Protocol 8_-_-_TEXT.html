Protocol 8
Protocol 8 : Colony PCR
Aim: DNA Fragment amplification from bacteria colonies
Realize a mix by adding the following component in a 1,5mL Eppendorf tube. 50µL of mix must be made per desired PCR reaction)
NB : All components must be vortexed before use
Component
Final concentration
Nuclease-free water
10X Standard Taq reaction Buffer
1X
10mM dNTPs
200µM
10µM Forward primer
0.2µM (0.05-1µM)
10µM Reverse primer
0.2µM (0.05-1µM)
Taq polymerase
5 units/50µL PCR
Add 50µL of the mix in each 0,2mL PCR tubes.
Pick a colony, add a stab of it into a PCR tube and put the rest of the colony on a new annotated and divided into square petri dish
Gently mix and spin down microcentrifuge PCR tubes.                                        Transfer PCR tubes to a PCR machine with the block preheated to 95°C
Set the following parameters for the PCR reaction :
Lid Temperature: 95°C
Initial denaturation : 95°C 5 min
25 cycles of :
- 95°C 30 s
- Tm* 1 min
- 68°C; 1 min per kB (amplification)
Final extension : 68°C for 5 min
Hold at 4°C
*precise Tm for each primer
Gel purification : Run samples on an electrophoresis gel to check cloning efficiency.
See the appropriate protocol (Protocol 3 : Electrophoresis )
Realize a bacterial miniculture of the colony with satisfying PCR results. Inoculate the colony grown on the divided into square petri dish into a 50mL Falcon tube with 5mL LB + appropriate antibiotic (chloramphenicol at 25µg/mL).
This will serve for the subsequent miniprep. See the appropriate protocol (Protocol 9 : Miniprep )

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
