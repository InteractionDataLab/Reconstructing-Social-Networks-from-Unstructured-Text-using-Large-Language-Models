PCR : on C1 and C2
Objectives
The overall purpose is to amplify our 2 different DNA fragments (C1, C2) for further digestions and ligations in order to construct biobricks.
Materials
DNA fragments :  C1: "Biosensor Reporter GFP", 1356 bp (Pref, Elowitz RBS, GFP gene, double terminator), synthesized by IDT.C2: "Pr-GFP Cello", 1285 bp (Pr, Elowitz RBS, GFP gene, double terminator), synthesized by IDT.Primers: A12 (forward) and A13 (reverse).
Protocol
PCR
Mix for 5 samples (Total volume of Mix: 240 µL), in an Eppendorf tube:
198.75 µL H2O
25 µL Buffer Taq (1 X final, NEB #B9014S)
5 µL Primer A12 ( 1 µM final)
5 µL Primer A13 (1 µM final)
5 µL dNTP (200 µM final, NEB #N0447S)
1.25 µL Taq polymerase (2.5 units / 50 µL PCR final, NEB #M0273S)
Add in 4 PCR tubes, in the following order:
48 µL Mix
2 µL of DNA fragment (C1, C2) or 2 µL H20 (Controls 1, 2)
—> Gently mix the reaction and perform a short spin centrifugation
Set the following parameters for the PCR reaction :
C1 (1356 bp)
Lid temperature: 95°C
Initial denaturation : 95°C, 30s
30 cycles of :
95°C, 30 s
58°C, 60 s
68°C, 1 min 22 s
Final extension : 68°C, 5 min
Hold : 4°C
C2 (1314 bp)
Lid temperature: 95°C
Initial denaturation : 95°C, 30s
30 cycles of :
95°C, 30 s
58°C, 60 s
68°C, 1 min 17 s
Final extension : 68°C, 5 min
Hold : 4°C
Electrophoresis: for screening the PCR results
1% Agarose gel:
Put 1 g of agarose + 100 mL of TAE 1X in a bottle of 500 mL
Mix and heat it 2 min 30 s in the microwave. Wait the cooling of the bottle until it is tepid.
Add 5 µL of Gel Red 10,000 X (0.5 X final)
Flow the gel and place the combs
Wait until it is solidified. Remove slowly the combs.
Drop-off:
Short Speed centrifugation of samples
Addition of 2 µL of Purple loading dye 6 X in 10 µL of sample
Drop-off 10 µL of Purple ladder and 12 µL of each samples.
Run at 90 V.
Results
Expected results / Obtained results
Interpretation
The PCR did not work and we did not observe DNA in the C1 stock. We will start again in case if it was linked to an error of manipulation, and we will also amplify an other DNA fragment, already successfully amplified, as a positive control for the PCR.

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
