Competent cells: E.Coli DH5⍺
Objectives
The objective is to make a stock of E.Coli DH5⍺ competent cells for subsequent transformations.
Materials
O/N DH5⍺ pre-culture (made the 22/07): O/N inoculation of 100 µL DH5⍺ into 100 mL LB
0.1M CaCl2: prepared the 23/07
0.1M CaCl2/15% Glycerol: prepared the 23/07
Protocol
Competence:
Inoculation of 3 mL O/N culture in 100 mL LB in 500 mL erlenmeyer.
Incubation at 250 rpm at 37°C until the DO 0,6 —> DO = 0.591
Cells were transferred to 3 sterile ice-cold 50 mL Falcon tubes. 20 mL in each falcon tube.
Incubate on ice for 30 min. Do not allow cells to warm up over 4°C.
Spin cells at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C.
Discard supernatant and try to drain all remaining media.
Gently resuspend on 10 mL cold 0.1M CaCl2
Incubate on ice 20 min
Centrifuge 10 min at 4,000 rpm at 4°C
Discard supernatant and gently resuspend on 5 mL cold 0.1M CaCl2/25% Glycerol
Transfer in 1.5 mL eppendorf (100 µL/tube)
Store at -80°C
NB: The competency of the prepared cells will be tested the 24/07.

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
