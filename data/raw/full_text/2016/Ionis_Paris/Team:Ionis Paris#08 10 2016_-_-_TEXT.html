Miniprep: on DH5⍺ transformed with BB-B0015
Objectives
Amplification of BB-B0015 plasmid extracted from bacterial mini-cultures in order to have a stock of plasmid and to construct BBX1 and BBX3.
Materials
2 Mini-cultures of bacteria transformed with BB-B0015 realized the 07/10 (put a colony with satisfying PCR results in 5 mL LB+Cm into a 50 mL Falcon tube).
From those mini-cultures, take 500 µL to realize a glycerol stock of tranformed bacteria. The 4.5 mL remaining will serve for the miniprep.
Protocol
The miniprep were realized using the QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, ref: 27104) , according to the protocol given by the supplier (available here ).
-Miniprep:
Divide each 4.5 mL bacterial O/N mini-cultures into 4 Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge all those tubes at 9,000 rpm for 3 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.
Resuspend the pellet in 62.5 μL Buffer P1 and pool the 4 Eppendorf tubes into a unique tube.
Add 250 μL Buffer P2 and mix by inverting the tube 6 times. The solution turns blue.
Add 350 μL Buffer N3 and mix by inverting the tube 6 times. The solution turns colorless.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm.
Load 800 μL supernatant from step 5 to the QIAprep 2.0 spin column. Centrifuge for 1 min and discard the flow-through.

PCR purification for digested BB1, G2:
QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, 28106), according to the protocol given by the supplier (available here )
Add 5 volumes Buffer PB (250 µL) to 1 volume of the PCR reaction (50 µL) and mix. The color of the mixture is yellow.

Ligation: G2 into BB1
Objectives
Ligation of G2 into BB1 to obtain BBG1, for subsequent transformation and creation of a stock of bacteria.
The molar ratios for the ligation were calculated using NEB BioCalculator (available here )
Materials
- Concentrations of the different components after digestion and PCR purification :
BB1:  8.33 ng/µL (250 ng / 30 µL)
G2: 1.6 ng/µL (50 ng / 30 µL)
Protocol
1. In the following order, add :
2. Mix by pipetting
3. Incubate at Room Temperature
Transformation: competent DH5⍺ cells with ligation product BBG1
Objectives
The objective is to transforme competent DH5⍺ cells with the ligation product BBG1
Materials
2 aliquot of 100 µL DH5⍺ competent cells (from the 20/09/16)
Plasmid DNA : Ligation product BBG1
Petri dish LB+Cm: Cm concentration = 25 µg/mL
Protocol
Experimental conditions achieved:
We need 4 LB+Cm plates + 3 LB plates
Transformation protocol:
Thaw tubes of DH5⍺ competent cells on ice for 10 min. Mix gently and carefully pipette 50 µL of cells into the 4 transformation tubes on ice.
Add the 40 µL plasmid DNA to the cell mixture.
Carefully flick the tubes 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.
Place on ice for 30 min. Do not mix.
Heat shock at exactly 42°C for 45 s. Do not mix.
Place on ice for 5 min. Do not mix.
Pipette 250 µL of room temperature SOC into the mixture.
Place at 37°C for 1h at 250 rpm.
Warm selection plates to 25°C.
Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tubes and inverting.
Spread the corresponding volume onto each plate.
Incubate all the plates O/N at 37°C.
Results (obtained on the 09/10)
Expected Results
Some colonies on the petri dishes LB+Cm plated with 50 µL of bacteria transformed with the different ligation products and more on the petri dishes LB+Cm plated with 200 µL of bacteria.
A bacterial lawn on the LB petri dishes without antibiotic.
No colonies on the LB+Cm petri dish plated with bacteria transformed with no plasmid (- control).
Obtained Results
We obtained expected results.
Interpretation
The transformation worked. Colonies contain a plasmid with the Chloramphenicol resistance gene, present in pSB1C3. However, this resistance can be due to the plamid BB1. It is possible that BB1 has closed up on itself. A PCR colonie is necessary to check the size of the plasmid present in colonies, and therefore in order to know if bacteria incorporated the correct plasmid.

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
