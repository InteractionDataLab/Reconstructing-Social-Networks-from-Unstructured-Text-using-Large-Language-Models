Mini prep: on DH5⍺ transformed with BB12mut and BB123mut
Objectives
Purification and quantification of BB12mut and BB123mut plasmids extracted from bacterial mini-cultures in order to sequence them.
Materials
16 Mini-cultures of bacteria transformed with BB12 (3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12) and BB123 (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13) realized the 06/09 (put a colony with satisfying PCR results in 5 mL LB+Cm into a 50 mL Falcon tube).
From those mini-cultures, take 500 µL to realize a glycerol stock of tranformed bacteria. The 4.5 mL remaining will serve for the miniprep.
Protocol
The miniprep were realized using the QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, ref: 27104)  and following the protocol given by the supplier (available here ).
Miniprep:
Divide each 4.5 mL bacterial O/N mini-cultures into 4 Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge all those tubes at 9,000 rpm for 3 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.
Resuspend the pellet in 62.5 μL Buffer P1 and pool the 4 Eppendorf tubes into a unique tube.
Add 250 μL Buffer P2 and mix by inverting the tube 6 times. The solution turns blue.
Add 350 μL Buffer N3 and mix by inverting the tube 6 times. The solution turns colorless.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm.
Load 800 μL supernatant from step 5 to the QIAprep 2.0 spin column. Centrifuge for 1 min and discard the flow-through.
Add 500 µL Buffer PB. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard the flow-through.
Add 750 µL Buffer PE. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard the flow-through.
Centrifuge once more for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
Place the QIAprep 2.0 spin column in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50 μL Buffer EB to the center of the QIAprep 2.0 spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
Calculate the quantity of DNA with the Nanodrop.
Store the purified DNA at -20°C.
Miniprep:
Add 100 µL of glycerol 50% to 100 µL of transformed bacteria in clean microcentrifuge 1.5 mL Eppendorf.
32 tubes of BB12mut (4 per mini-cultures)
32 tubes of BB123mut (4 per mini-cultures)
Store at -80°C.
NB: No nanodrop quantification of samples was performed due to the departure of the machine.

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
