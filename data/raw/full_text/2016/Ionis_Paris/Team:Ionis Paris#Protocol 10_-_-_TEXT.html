Protocol 10
Protocol 10: Site directed Mutagenesis
Aim: Modify a given section of a plasmid
Exponential amplification
Primers should be designed with 5´ ends annealing back-to-back. It is recommend to use the NEB online design software, NEBaseChanger™.

Perform a thermocycling as follows:
Initial denaturation: 98°C for 30s
25 cycles of :
- 98°C 10s
- Provided Ta temperature 10-30s
- 72°C; 20/30s per kB (amplification)
72°C for 2 min
Hold: 4°C
KLD Reaction
Prepare the following reaction mix:

10X KLD Enzyme Mix
1 µL
1X
Nuclease-free Water
3 µL
Incubate for 5 min at room temperature
Transformation
Add 5μL of KLD mix to 50μL of chemically-competent cells.
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
Heat shock at 42°C for 30 seconds.
Incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
Add 950μL SOC, gently shake at 37°C for 1 hour.
Spread 40–100 μL onto appropriate selection plate, incubate overnight at 37°C.

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
