Objective
The objective is to transforme competent DH5⍺ cells with the ligation products BBX3, BBX5, pSB1A2-C45 and BBG3
Materials
4 aliquot of 100 µL DH5⍺ competent cells (from the 20/09/16)
Plasmid DNA : Ligation product BBX3, BBX5, pSB1A2-C45 and BBG3
Petri dish LB+Cm: Cm concentration = 25 µg/mL
Petri dish LB+Amp: Cm concentration = 100 µg/mL
Materials
Experimental conditions achieved :
—> We need 8 LB+Cm plates+ 4 LB+Amp plates + 7 LB plates
Transformations protocol:
Thaw tubes of DH5⍺ competent cells on ice for 10 min. Mix gently and carefully pipette 50 µL of cells into the 4 transformation tubes on ice.
Add the ligation products to the cell mixtures.
Carefully flick the tubes 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.
Place on ice for 30 min. Do not mix.
Heat shock at exactly 42°C for 45 s. Do not mix.
Place on ice for 5 min. Do not mix.
Pipette 250 µL of room temperature SOC into the mixture.
Place at 37°C for 1h at 250 rpm.
Warm selection plates to 25°C.
Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tubes and inverting.
Spread the corresponding volume onto each plate.
Incubate all the plates O/N at 37°C.
Results (obtain the 11/10)
Expected results :
Some colonies on the petri dishes LB+Cm plated with 50 µL of bacteria transformed with the different ligation products and more on the petri dishes LB+Cm plated with 200 µL of bacteria.
A bacterial lawn on the LB petri dishes without antibiotic.
No colonies on the LB+Cm petri dish plated with bacteria transformed with no plasmid (- control).
Obtained results:
We obtained expected results.
Interpretation
The transformation worked. Colonies contain a plasmid with the Chloramphenicol/Ampicilline resistance gene, present in pSB1C3/pSB1A2. A PCR colonie is necessary to check the size of the plasmid present in colonies, and therefore in order to know if bacteria incorpore the correct plasmid.
