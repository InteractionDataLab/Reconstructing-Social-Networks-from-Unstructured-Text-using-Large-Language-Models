Miniprep: on DH5⍺ transformed with BBX3, BBX5, BBG3, pSB1A2-C45
Objectives
Purification and quantification of BBX3, BBX5, pSB1A2-C45 and BBG3 plasmids extracted from bacterial mini-cultures in order to construct new biobricks and to sequence them.
Materials
Mini-cultures of bacteria transformed with BBX3 (1, 2, 3), BBX5 (1, 2, 3), pSB1A2-C45 (4, 5, 6, 7) and BBG3 (1, 2, 3) realized the 11/10 (put a colony with satisfying PCR results in 5 mL LB+Cm / Amp (for pSB1A2-C45) into a 50 mL Falcon tube).  From those mini-cultures, take 300 µL to realize a glycerol stock of tranformed bacteria. The 4.7 mL remaining will serve for the miniprep.
Protocol
The miniprep were realized using the QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit ( Qiagen, ref: 27104 )
Miniprep:
Divide each 4.5 mL bacterial O/N mini-cultures into 4 Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge all those tubes at 9,000 rpm for 3 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.
Resuspend the pellet in 62.5 μL Buffer P1 and pool the 4 Eppendorf tubes into a unique tube.
Add 250 μL Buffer P2 and mix by inverting the tube 6 times. The solution turns blue.
Add 350 μL Buffer N3 and mix by inverting the tube 6 times. The solution turns colorless.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm.
Load 800 μL supernatant from step 5 to the QIAprep 2.0 spin column. Centrifuge for 1 min and discard the flow-through.
Add 500 µL Buffer PB. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard the flow-through.
Add 750 µL Buffer PE. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard the flow-through.
Centrifuge once more for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
Place the QIAprep 2.0 spin column in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50 μL Buffer EB to the center of the QIAprep 2.0 spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
Calculate the quantity of DNA with the Nanodrop.
Store the purified DNA at -20°C.
Bacteria storage :
1.  Add 100 µL of glycerol to 100 µL of transformed bacteria in a clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.
9 tubes of BBX3 (3 per mini-cultures)
12 tubes of BBX5 (3 per mini-cultures)
9 tubes of BBX5 (3 per mini-cultures)
9 tubes of BBX5 (3 per mini-cultures)
2. Store at -80°C.

Different ligation ratios are going to be tested : 1:1, 1:2, 1:3. The molar ratios for the ligations were calculated using NEB BioCalculator (available here )
Materials
Concentrations of the different components after digestion and PCR purification :
pSB1C3: 4.3 ng/µL (129 ng / 30 µL)
C45 (EP): 3.75 ng/µL (112.5 ng / 30 µL)
BBA: 8.3 ng/µL (250 ng / 30 µL)
C45 (XP): 1.25 ng/µL (37.5 ng / 30 µL)
X5: 5 ng/µL (150 ng / 30 µL)
B0015:  3.75 ng/µL (112.5 ng / 30 µL)
In the following order, add :
Mix by pipetting
Incubate for 1h at room temperature
Transformation: competent DH5⍺ cells with ligation product BBC45, BBC3 and BBX1
Objectives
The objective is to transforme competent DH5⍺ cells with the ligation products of BBC45, BBC3 and BBX1.
Materials
3 aliquot of 100 µL DH5⍺ competent cells (from the 20/09/16)
Plasmid DNA : Ligation product BBC45, BBC3 and BBX1
Petri dish LB+Cm: Cm concentration = 25 µg/mL
Protocol
Experimental conditions achieved:
We need 8 LB+Cm plates + 5 LB plates
Transformation protocol
Thaw 2 tubes of DH5⍺ competent cells on ice for 10 min. Mix gently and carefully pipette 50 µL of cells into the 4 transformation tubes on ice.
Add the 20 µL plasmid DNA to the cell mixture.
Carefully flick the tubes 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.
Place the mixture on ice for 30 min. Do not mix.
Heat shock at exactly 42°C for 45 s. Do not mix.
Place on ice for 5 min. Do not mix.
Pipette 250 µL of room temperature SOC into the mixture.
Place at 37°C for 60 min at 250 rpm.
Warm selection plates to 25°C.
Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tube and inverting.
Spread the corresponding volume onto each plate.
Incubate all the plates O/N at 37°C.
Results (obtained on the 13/10)
Expected results:
Some colonies on the petri dishes LB+Cm plated with 50 µL of bacteria transformed with the different ligation products and more on the petri dishes LB+Cm plated with 200 µL of bacteria. A bacterial lawn on the LB petri dishes without antibiotic. No colonies on the LB+Cm petri dish plated with bacteria transformed with no plasmid (- control).
Obtained results:
We obtained expected results.
Interpretation
The transformation worked. Colonies contain a plasmid with the Chloramphenicol resistance gene, present in pSB1C3. A PCR colonie is necessary to check the size of the plasmid present in colonies, and therefore in order to know if bacteria incorpore the correct plasmid.

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
