Miniprep: on DH5⍺ transformed with BBC2
Objectives
Purification of BBC2 plasmid extracted from bacterial mini-cultures in order to have a stock of this plasmid and to sequence it.
Materials
5 Mini-cultures of bacteria transformed with BBC2 (1,4,7,8) realized the 05/10 (put a colony with satisfying PCR results in 5 mL LB+Cm into a 50 mL Falcon tube). From those mini-cultures, take 300 µL to realize a glycerol stock of tranformed bacteria. The 4.7 mL remaining will serve for the miniprep.
Protocol
The miniprep were realized using the QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit ( Qiagen, ref: 27104 )
Miniprep:
Divide each 4.5 mL bacterial O/N mini-cultures into 4 Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge all those tubes at 9,000 rpm for 3 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.
Resuspend the pellet in 62.5 μL Buffer P1 and pool the 4 Eppendorf tubes into a unique tube.
Add 250 μL Buffer P2 and mix by inverting the tube 6 times. The solution turns blue.
Add 350 μL Buffer N3 and mix by inverting the tube 6 times. The solution turns colorless.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm.
Load 800 μL supernatant from step 5 to the QIAprep 2.0 spin column. Centrifuge for 1 min and discard the flow-through.
Add 500 µL Buffer PB. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard the flow-through.
Add 750 µL Buffer PE. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard the flow-through.
Centrifuge once more for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
Place the QIAprep 2.0 spin column in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50 μL Buffer EB to the center of the QIAprep 2.0 spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
Calculate the quantity of DNA with the Nanodrop.
Store the purified DNA at -20°C.
Bacteria storage :
1.  Add 100 µL of glycerol to 100 µL of transformed bacteria in a clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.
24 tubes of BB2
3 tubes of BB3
12 tubes of BB12
2. Store at -80°C.
Digestion: BB12 and BBX4
Objectives
Double digestion of BB12 by SpeI and PstI, and of BBX4 by XbaI and PstI for the subsequent ligation of X4 in BB12 in order to create BBX5.
Materials
Stock concentrations:
BB12mut-4: 250 ng/µL (from mini prep realised the 07/09)
BBX4-1: ~150 ng/µL (from mini prep realised the 03/10)
Quantity of DNA required for ligation of P1, P2 and P3 into pSB1C3:
BB12: Digestion of 100 ng (50 ng needed per ratio)
BBX4: Digestion of 270 ng (ratio 3:1 = 24.61 ng of digested X4 needed, ratio 5:1 = 41.02 ng of digested X4 needed —> 65.63 ng of X4 needed —> 255.38 ng of BBX4 needed)
Protocol
Digestion:
In a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, adding in the respected order (bigger volume first and enzyme last) :
NB: The digestion were done in 20 µL.
Short Spin Centrifugation
Incubation 1h at 37°C
Store at 4°C before gel electrophoresis and purification
Electrophoresis for digested BBX4:
1% Agarose gel:
Put 1 g of agarose low melting point + 100 mL of TAE 1X in a bottle of 500 mL.
Mix and heat it 2min 30s in the microwaves. Wait the cooling of the bottle until it is tepid.
Add 3 µL of Gel Red 10,000X (0.3X final).
Flow the gel and place the combs.
Wait until it is solidified. Remove slowly the combs.
Drop-off:
Short Speed centrifugation of samples.
Addition of 4 µL of Purple loading dye 6X in the 20 µL of sample.
Drop-off 10 µL of Purple ladder and 25 µL of sample.
Run at 90 V.
PCR purification for digested BB12:
QIAquick Gel purification kit (Qiagen, 28704), according to the protocol given by the supplier (available here )
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel. Gel slice Weigh = 304 g
Add 3 volumes Buffer QG (612 µL) to 1 volume of gel.
Incubate at 50°C for 10 min until the gel slice has completely dissolved. Vortex the tube every 2–3 min to help dissolve gel. The color of the mixture is yellow.
Add 1 gel volume isopropanol to the sample and mix.
Load 800 µL of each samples to the QIAquick column. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard flow-through. Load the rest and spin again.
Add 500 µL Buffer QG. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard flow-through.
Add 750 µL Buffer PE. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard flow-through.
Centrifuge once more for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50 µL Buffer EB to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
Store the purified DNA at 4°C before the ligation.

Expected results / Obtained results:
Interpretation
The digestion of BBX4 was not efficient, we get 1 very light strip at the end of the electrophoresis. The strip that we obtained correspond to the backbone. Considering the low intensity of the backbone strip, we can suppose that the second strip of 717 bp, corresponding to the digested X4, is too low to be observable. We can conclude that the quantity of DNA was not enough, the stock concentration was overestimated. We have to make a new digestion using a bigger quantity of BBX4.
Transformation: competent DH5⍺ cells with BB-B0015
Objectives
The objective is to transforme competent DH5⍺ cells with the ligation products BB-B0015.
Materials
2 aliquot of 100 µL DH5⍺ competent cells (from the 20/09/16).
Plasmid DNA : BB-B0015 (from the plate 5, BBa_B0015, resuspended the 04/10/16).
Protocol
Experimental conditions realized:
—> We need 6 LB+Cm plates + 4 LB plates
Transformation Protocol:
Thaw tubes of DH5⍺ competent cells on ice for 10 min. Mix gently and carefully pipette 50 µL of cells into the 4 transformation tubes on ice.
Add the 1 µL (200/300ng) plasmid DNA to the cell mixture.
Carefully flick the tubes 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.
Place on ice for 30 min. Do not mix.
Heat shock at exactly 42°C for 45 s. Do not mix.
Place on ice for 5 min. Do not mix.
Pipette 250 µL of room temperature SOC into the mixture.
Place at 37°C for 1h at 250 rpm.
Warm selection plates to 25°C.
Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tubes and inverting.
Spread the corresponding volume onto each plate.
Incubate all the plates O/N at 37°C.
Results (obtained on the 07/10)
Expected results:
Some colonies on the petri dishes LB+CHL plated with 1 µL of bacteria transformed with the different ligation products, more on the petri dishes plated with 10 µL, and more on the petri dishes plated with 100 µL of bacteria. A bacterial lawn on the LB petri dishes without antibiotic. No colonies on the LB+Cm petri dish plated with bacteria transformed with no plasmid (- control).
Obtained results:
We obtained only 2 colonies on the petri dish plated with 100 µL of transformed bacteria and none in the two others, plated with 10 µL and 1 µL.
Interpretation
The transformation worked. Colonies contain a plasmid with the Chloramphenicol resistance gene, present in pSB1C3.

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
