Digestion: BB1 and C4
Objectives
Double digestion of BB1 by SpeI and PstI, and of BBC2 by XbaI and PstI for the subsequent ligation of C2 in BB1.
Materials
Stock concentrations:
BB1-2: 97,3 ng/µL (from mini prep realised the 26/07)
BBC5-1: ~175 ng/µL (from mini prep realized the 03/10)
Quantity of DNA required for the ligation of C5 into BB1:
BB1: Digestion of 50 ng (25 ng needed per ratio)
BBC5: Digestion of 175 ng (ratio 3:1 = 25 ng of digested C5 needed, ratio 2:1 = 16.5 ng of digested C5 needed —> 42 ng of C5 needed —> 142 ng of BBC5 needed)
Protocol
Digestion:
1. In a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, adding in the respected order (bigger volume first and enzyme last) :
2. Short Spin Centrifugation
3. Incubation 1h at 37°C
4. Store at 4°C before gel electrophoresis and purification
Electrophoresis for digested BBC5:
1% Agarose gel:
1. Put 1 g of agarose low melting point + 100 mL of TAE 1X in a bottle of 500 mL.
2. Mix and heat it 2min 30s in the microwaves. Wait the cooling of the bottle until it is tepid.
3. Add 3 µL of Gel Red 10,000X (0.3X final).
4. Flow the gel and place the combs.
5. Wait until it is solidified. Remove slowly the combs.
Drop-off:
1. Short Speed centrifugation of samples.
2. Addition of 4 µL of Purple loading dye 6X in the 20 µL of sample.
3. Drop-off 10 µL of Purple ladder and 25 µL of sample.
Plan:
4. Run at 90 V.
Gel purification for C5:
QIAquick Gel purification kit (Qiagen, 28704), according to the protocol given by the supplier (available on https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=f4ba2d24-8218-452c-ad6f-1b6f43194425&lang=en)
1. Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel. Gel slice Weigh = 0.235 g
2. Add 3 volumes Buffer QG (705 µL) to 1 volume of gel.
3. Incubate at 50°C for 10 min until the gel slice has completely dissolved. Vortex the tube every 2–3 min to help dissolve gel. The color of the mixture is yellow.
4. Add 1 gel volume isopropanol to the sample and mix.
5. Load 800 µL of each samples to the QIAquick column. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard flow-through. Load the rest and spin again.
6. Add 500 µL Buffer QG. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard flow-through.
7. Add 750 µL Buffer PE. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard flow-through.
8. Centrifuge once more for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
9. Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
10. Add 30 µL Buffer EB to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
11. Store the purified DNA at 4°C before the ligation.
PCR purification for digested BB1:
QIAquick PCR purification kit (qiagen, 28106), according to the protocol given by the supplier (available on https://www.qiagen.com/fi/resources/resourcedetail?id=390a728a-e6fc-43f7-bf59-b12091cc4380&lang=en)
1. Add 5 volumes Buffer PB (100 µL) to 1 volume of the sample (20 µL) and mix. The color of the mixture is yellow.
2. Load the sample to the QIAquick column. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard flow-through.
3. Add 750 µL Buffer. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard flow-through.
4. Centrifuge once more for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
5. Place each QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
6. Add 30 µL Buffer EB to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm .
7. Calculate the quantity of DNA with the Nanodrop.
8. Store the purified DNA at 4°C before the ligation.

Expected results / Obtained results:
Interpretation
The digestion of BBC5 was efficient, we get 2 strips at the end of the electrophoresis. The strip at 857 pb was the digested C5 that we purified for the subsequent ligation.
Ligation of C5 into BB1  :
Objectives
Ligation of C5 into BB1 in order to obtain BBC2, for subsequent transformation and creation of a stock of bacteria.The molar ratios for the ligation were calculated using NEB BioCalculator (http://nebiocalculator.neb.com/#!/ligation).
Materials
Concentrations of the different components after digestion and PCR purification:
BB1:  3.24 ng/µL (97 ng / 30 µL)
C5: 1.67 ng/µL (50 ng / 30 µL)
1. In the following order, add :
NB: The ligations were done in 30 µL
2. Mix by pipetting
3. Incubate for 1h at room temperature
For the construction of our plasmid, we selected parts that are RFC[10] compatible. In Figure 4 below, the map of our plasmid is represented in a simplified way, composed of the pSB1C3 backbone and the biosensor part.

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
