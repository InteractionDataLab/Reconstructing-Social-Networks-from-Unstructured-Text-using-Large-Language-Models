Protocol 9
Protocol 9 : Colony PCR
Aim: DNA Fragment amplification from bacteria colonies
Liquid LB medium preparation (1L)
Realize a mix by adding the following component in a 1,5 mL tubes (realize 20 µL of mix per desired PCR reaction)
NB : All components must be vortexed before use
Add 20 µL of the mix in each 0,2 mL PCR tubes.
Pick a colony and add a stab of it into a PCR tube.
Gently mix and spin down microcentrifuge.                                        Transfer PCR tubes to a PCR machine with the block preheated to 95°C
Set the following parameters for the PCR reaction :
Lid Temperature: 95°C
Initial denaturation : 95°C 30 s
25 cycles of :
- 95°C 30s
- 58°C 60s
- 68°C; 1 min per kB (amplification)
Final extension : 68°C for 5 min
Hold at 4°C
Reagents
10X Taq rection buffer (NEB, #B9014S)
10 mM dNTPs (NEB, #N0447S)
