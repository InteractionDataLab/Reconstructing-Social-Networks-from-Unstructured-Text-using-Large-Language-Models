Transformation: competent DH5⍺ cells with ligation products BB1, BB2 and BB3
Objectives
The objective is to transforme competent DH5⍺ cells with the ligation products BB1, BB2 and BB3 to create a stock of transformed bacteria.
Materials
6 aliquots of NEB DH5⍺ Competent E.coli (C2287)
Plasmid DNA : Ligation product BB1, BB2 and BB3 (from the 20/07/16)
Petri dish LB+Cm: Cm concentration = 25 µg/mL
Protocol
Experimental conditions achieved :
We need 20 LB+Cm plates + 11 LB plates
Transformations protocol:
haw 2 tubes of DH5⍺ competent cells on ice for 10 min. Mix gently and carefully pipette 50 µL of cells into the 4 transformation tubes on ice.
Add the 20 µL / 30 µL plasmid DNA to the cell mixture.
Carefully flick the tubes 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.
Place on ice for 30 min. Do not mix.
Heat shock at exactly 42°C for 45 s. Do not mix.
Place on ice for 5 min. Do not mix.
Pipette 250 µL of room temperature SOC into the mixture.
Place at 37°C for 1h at 250 rpm.
Warm selection plates to 25°C.
Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tubes and inverting.
Spread the corresponding volume onto each plate.
Incubate all the plates O/N at 37°C.
Results (obtain the 22/07)
Expected results:
Some colonies on the petri dishes LB+Cm plated with 50 µL of bacteria transformed with the different ligation products and more on the petri dishes LB+Cm plated with 200 µL of bacteria.
A bacterial lawn on the LB petri dish without antibiotic.
No colonies on the LB+Cm petri dish plated with bacteria transformed with no plasmid (- control).
Obtained results:
We obtained expected results for petri-dishes plated with bacteria transformed with BB1 and BB2, but there is no colonies for petri-dishes plated with bacteria transformed with BB3.
Interpretation
The transformation worked for BB1 and BB2. Colonies contain a plasmid with the Chloramphenicol resistance gene, present in pSB1C3. A PCR colonie is necessary to check the size of the plasmid present in colonies, and therefore in order to know if bacteria incorpore the correct plasmids BB1 and BB2. A new digestion, ligation and transformation is necessary for BB3.

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
