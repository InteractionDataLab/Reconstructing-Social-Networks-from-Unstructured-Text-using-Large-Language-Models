Transformation efficiency test : Competent DH5⍺ cells with pSB1C3-RFP plasmid
Objectives
To test the competency of the DH5⍺ cells done on the 05/06/16 with the stock of pSB1C3-RFP plasmid.
Materials
Plasmid DNA : pSB1C3-RFP at 200 pg/µL
DH5⍺ competent cells ( )
Petri dish LB+Cm: Cm concentration = 25 µg/mL
Protocol
Thaw 1 tube of DH5α competent cells on ice for 10 min. Mix gently and carefully pipette 50 µL of cells into 2 transformation tubes on ice.
Add 1 µL (200 pg) of plasmid DNA to the cell mixture. Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.
Place the mixture on ice for 30 min. Do not mix.
Heat shock at exactly 42°C for 30 s. Do not mix.
Place on ice for 5 min. Do not mix.
Pipette 950 µL of room temperature SOC into the mixture.
Place at 37°C for 60 min at 250 rpm.
Warm selection plates to 25°C.
Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tube and inverting.
Spread 100 µL of each dilution (100%,10%,1%) onto a selection plate.
Pellet the remaining cells (except for the control), discard mostly all the supernatant and resuspend the remaining cells in 100 µL of LB. Spread 100 µL onto a selection plate.
Incubate all the plates O/N at 37°C.
Results
Expected results :
Some colonies on the petri dishes LB+Cm plated with 1% of transformed bacteria, more with 10%, a lot with 100% and a bacterial lawn with the pellet.
A bacterial lawn is expected on the LB petri dishes (+ control).
No colony is expected on the LB+Cm petri dish plated with no plasmid (- control).
All obtained colonies are expected to be red because of the RFP gene that codes for a red fluorescent protein.
Obtained results:
We obtained expected results.
Interpretation
The transformation worked, as we obtained satisfying results. Colonies contain a plasmid with the Chloramphenicol resistance gene, present in pSB1C3. The DH5α cells are therefore competent.

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
