Results
Expected results / Obtained results:
Interpretation
The digestion of pSB1C3-RFP was efficient, we get 2 strips at the end of the electrophoresis. The strip at 2070 pb was the digested pSB1C3 that we purified for the subsequent ligation.

Miniprep: on DH5⍺ transformed with BB2mut, BBX2, BBC4 and BBG2
Objective
Purification of BB2mut, BBC4 and BBG2 plasmids extracted from bacterial mini-cultures.
Materials
7 Mini-cultures of bacteria transformed with BB2mut (1,2,4), BBC4 (2,4,6) and BBG2 (4) realized the 18/10 (put a colony with satisfying PCR results in 5 mL LB+Cm into a 50 mL Falcon tube).
From those mini-cultures, take 500 µL to realize a glycerol stock of tranformed bacteria. The 4.5 mL remaining will serve for the miniprep.

We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
