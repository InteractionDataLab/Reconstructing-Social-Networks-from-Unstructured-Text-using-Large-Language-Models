                                     The European Experience 
                                    </H2></DIV><DIV class="blog_content"><BLOCKQUOTE>
                                        

The concept of the European Experience 2016 was both simple and bold: two teams would work together in order to organize in Paris the gathering of most of the iGEM 2016 European teams.
                                    </BLOCKQUOTE><P>It all started during the brainstorming sessions of our team. We talked about the previous editions of the iGEM competition, and realized that, if America or Asia had regional meetups every year, Europe didn’t have one since the end of the « official » iGEM regional meetups system.
We therefore had the idea, for the first time in the history of the iGEM, to organize a big event of our own.
We also wanted to make this event a collaborative project with another iGEM team. That is why we worked with the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Evry"><FONT color="DeepPink"> Evry iGEM team</FONT></A> to carry out the project. 
</P><P>
The event, named The European Experience 2016, aimed to bring together European iGEM teams in order to:
</P><LI><P>Share our iGEM experience / adventures (successes, failures, issues, knowledge, human experiences...)</P></LI><LI><P>Create partnerships and strengthen the bonds between the attending teams</P></LI><LI><P>Train the pitch and presentation skills in order to prepare to the Boston Giant Jamboree</P></LI><LI><P>To discover the projects of other teams</P></LI><LI><P>Allow a cultural exchange and the discovery of Paris, the City of Light</P></LI><LI><P>Increase the general knowledge about Synthetic Biology through conferences and events</P></LI><LI><P>From fun around a student party only iGEM</P></LI></DIV><DIV class="related_post"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><H3>The European Experience Project</H3></DIV><DIV class="related_post_top clearfix"><DIV class="col-md-12"><P>Three people from the Marketing part of the iGEM IONIS team were working full-time on the European Experience in order to turn our vision into a successful event: Alexandre DOLLET, Jessica MATIAS and Anthony RENODON. Due to the scale of the event, the required work was quite huge, and three people were barely enough. As said before, we were also working with Taman MOUMADHI, Maria BARGUES RIBERA and Alba IGLESIAS from the iGEM Evry team. This collaboration was very proficient, and allowed us to efficiently plan the event. This project has brought us a lot in skills: Project management, retro planning, sponsoring, design, communication, prospecting, contract negotiations. We also learnt how to deal with all kind issues, whether they are financial, technical or human.</P><P>Of course, one of the first things we had to take into account was the financial situation of all the teams: we wanted all the teams to come, and therefore we tried to reduce as much as possible the cost of coming to such an event. Due to the vast amount of flight companies and countries, we couldn’t really do anything about the plane tickets, but we managed to get a deal with a Parisian hotel for the teams who had no idea where to sleep. We set up an online ticketing system to ease things, and were ready to announce our event to the world !
</P><P>We announced our event on April the 27th, with a logo designed by Jessica MATIAS, and reached out for every team members we could find on social media. Through this was a lot of work, it proved to be efficient. The Facebook page we created for our event kept getting more and more likes, and we soon started to receive tons of manifestations of interest from all iGEMers. The event was already promising !</P><P>One of our main concerns was the place where the event would be organized at: we had to choose a place that would be able to host everyone, easy to reach, with good places to eat right around the corner, and preferentially in the center of Paris. This seemed like an unsolvable conundrum, until the IONIS group offered us to use one of their building in Parmentier, that was just what we needed ! Even better, we had no charge on using the building. Once this issue addressed, we started looking at how we would organize the place. Fortunately there was a lot of space that we could use. We were given levels 0 and -1, and were able to organize them as we wanted. The place also had a backyard where we would be able to do the coffee break, a rooftop room with a beautiful view for the V.I.Ps,  and most importantly a state-of-the-art amphitheater for the conferences. Finding this place was very comforting for us, as we knew we would be able to host our event in the best possible conditions.

                                        As said before, once the event was announced on social websites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and the iGEM website) we wanted to have the biggest impact possible on the iGEM Community. We therefore started editing logos and banners, such as the ones you can see below.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>These were posted online, in order to give to the greatest amount of persons possible an access to the essential informations they needed to know. Infographics were also created, to make sure the information was clearly explained for everyone.</P><P>
To achieve further communication, we decided to make a quick video teaser about the event to encourage European iGEMers to come. In our video we highlighted the meeting, exchange and Paris.</P></DIV><DIV class="related_post"><DIV class="bloggrid_right"><DIV class="post_text"><H4>Watch the video</H4></DIV></DIV><CENTER><VIDEO width="760" height="415" poster="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2015/8/83/Logo_IONIS.png" controls=""><P><FONT color="DeepPink">Your browser either does not support HTML5 or cannot handle MediaWiki open video formats.

Fortunately, we had the luck to work with two Computer scientists, members of the iGEM IONIS team, that coded an little app we designed: the European Experience Companion App, or EECA for short.</P><P>The EECA is available on both iOS and Android smartphones, and is designed to work offline: as some people may not have an internet access abroad, this feature was absolutely necessary. The app would update itself if any connection was detected, but would otherwise function offline without any problem.</P><P>
It featured four main tabs: the first one, the Home tab, included a short description of the teams organizing this event and their projects, along with links to our media pages and e-mail addresses.</P><P>
Then comes the « Map » tab: we drew a map of the campus so that every team could know where to go and where to visit « that project I wanted to see » ! The building plans were a bit hard to get access to, but it was eventually worth it, as everyone had a clear understanding of the event’s organization.</P><P>The “Events” tab included a timeline of the Saturday events, with the time and location of each event. It was designed so that everyone could have access to the crucial informations quickly, and know where to be at the right time.
</P><P>
It also featured three levels of details, the first one being the previously evoked timeline: clicking on a particular event led to more informations about it, such as a description of the conference’s topic. Then, in the case of a conference, clicking on a speaker’s portrait would lead to the speaker’s biography, so that everyone would know easily who the speakers were.</P><P>This tab was designed for the lunch break: we have been scouting the place where the event was organized at in order to find all possible places to eat, and listed them in a special tab.
</P><P>All of them were sorted by price range, and featured a link to the restaurant’s website or phone number.We included a few French restaurants, and tried to make everyone happy with their meal ! We even found a gluten-free restaurant, just in case.We also tried to get iGEMers a discount if they showed the app to the restaurant’s managers, but this wasn’t possible.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog_top"><H4 class="blog_topHd" id="Morning">

                                        In the morning, students arrived and met us in the entrance hall. After receiving a badge displaying their name, team and country of origin they could go downstairs and start installing their stand while enjoying a nice breakfast provided by Paul, one of our sponsors. Paul provided us a wide selection of French cakes and breads that everyone could enjoy. The idea was to make foreign students discover French culture step by step ! </BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="blog_content"><BLOCKQUOTE>
                                        It is with pleasure that we could see during the morning all the projects being presented with passion, exchanges between students and teams, partnerships being forged, friendships getting created …
As said by Madeleine Premm, member of the LMU-Munich TUM team: &quot;The event is top and multicultural: we really meet people from different places! Everyone is very outgoing and noone is afraid to ask questions or present his own project, his career, his studies, etc… Each discussion is interesting. The event also allows team building and is also a good workout for the final Jamboree in October: you can practice your English and get used to describe your project ».</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="blog_top"><H4 class="blog_topHd" id="Conferences">

The opening ceremony was led by Paul Indelicato, deputy director of Thierry MANDON’s cabinet, Secretary of State for Higher Education and Research.
</P><P>The first thing to know about this symposium is that we wanted to organize an event as much entertaining and sharing as possible.
That’s why we planned a main scientific symposium through two roundtables to maximize the exchange between the speakers and the audience.Then, we decided to focus our both roundtables about synthetic biology of course.
However, we didn’t want to only deal with sciences in a global way.
That’s why we planned to divide our scientific symposium into two related but different roundtables.

Nowadays, it is really important to better understand the challenge of Synthetic Biology. Indeed, it is going to be the future of many fields of expertise. Our 5 different speakers shared with us their own expertise and help us discern the key points of synthetic biology development.</P><P>The first one, named “Synthetic Biology: Challenges &amp; Risks” was dedicated to the academic world. How the synthetic biology environment is ruled in France, but also in Europe or Worldwide. The goal of this roundtable was to identify the purpose of synthetic biology regarding our own development as scientists. 
We had 5 different speakers that have shared their opinions and experiences with us. It was really an enriching experience for every igemers all over Europe, especially because of the background of the speakers. 
Indeed, all of them were well known scientist coming from famous French entities and companies all over the world such as CNRS, Pasteur Institute, CEA, and even from the French Government, with the Secretariat of State for Defense and National Security.The feedback that we had from the first roundtable was really great, the audience had a lot of questions about the development of synthetic biology and how it would be related in their carriers.</P><H3>After all this work, the teams organized a short coffee break in the backyard.</H3></DIV><H2>Round table #2</H2><H3>Synthetic biology : a new economic world</H3><DIV class="related_post"><DIV class="bloggrid_right"><DIV class="post_text"><H4>From left to right  : Michael KREL (CEO EnobraQ), Philippe JAIS (Chief Executive &amp; Scientific Officer at Eukarÿs), Cyrille PAUTHENIER (CEO of Abolis and gold medal at iGEM 2012) and Gilles DEFREL (R&amp;D internship at Glowee and gold medal at iGEM 2015.</H4></DIV></DIV><P>This conference aims at showing the importance of Synthetic Biology in our professional careers. We will look at how much it is attractive and useful to participate to the iGEM competition fo our personal career development.Find out the career opportunities that offers the present us their success stories, and explain why &amp; how Synthetic Biology is essential these days.</P><P>The second roundtable, named “Synthetic Biology: A New Economic World” was dedicated to the professional world and to better know what place exactly takes synthetic biology in the biotechnology environment. The goal of this roundtable was to valorize the iGEM experience and to deal with the place of synthetic biology in the professional world through different companies &amp; industries (Environment, Healthcare).
We had 4 different speakers that have shared their professional lives with the audience, some of them had already participated or was fully aware about the iGEM competition.The feedback coming from this roundtable was really successful, especially thanks to the speakers explaining to the audience how relevant it is to participate to that kind of competition for their future carriers. The students from the 11 different countries all over Europe really appreciated all of the tips and advices that gave the speakers during this roundtable. A lot of exchange between the both parties were focused on the patenting process which was a really good topic to deal with because of the lot interrogations of the students.</P><P>The first thing to know about this symposium is that we wanted to organize an event as much entertaining and sharing as possible.

This dramatic acceleration of its destiny, Cyrille Pauthenier the assigns a go-getter spirit, supported by a healthy dose of self-confidence.

 
The first decisive turn, he takes it in 2011: &quot;I loved chemistry, but not its consequences on the environment. I realized we could do it cheaper and less polluting with synthetic biology by modifying living organisms to produce compounds that we need. &quot;He drops the ENS between synthetic biology master at Evry University, enrolled in the student competition iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine), and then began a PhD at the Institute of Systems Biology synthetic and Jean-Loup Faulon. The economic potential of his subject - a new method of exploitation of yeast in industrial environments - gives him ideas ...
Why not offer to the pharmaceutical companies, energy or agricultural, to tailor synthetic bacteria strains that would manufacture the compounds they need from renewable resources? This will be Abolish Biotechnologies, which he founded in 2014 with an applied mathematics specialist, Anthony Tschirhard. The company has been honored in the global innovation competition, launched in 2013 by the gouvenement.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="blog_top"><H4 class="blog_topHd" id="Cocktail">

We managed to free some time in the students courses to organize project presentations and to get to spend some time with them answering their questions about what was Synthetic Biology, the iGEM and what we were doing.
We also performed some food selling throughout the week in order to raise funds for our project
Last but not least, we also organized a contest for the students: by groups, they had to design a scientific poster based on a previous iGEM project. The posters would be evaluated by a selection of teachers from the school, on various criteria such as design and scientific content. There were prizes to win for the best posters, and we had a lot of fun showing them all to the school !</P><P>On the last day, we organized a giant BBQ for all the school: the results were announced, and everyone had fun, students and teachers.</P><P>This event was an amazing thing to do, and we hope it will help to create an “iGEM-supportive” state of mind in our school ! We also hope to have motivated some students to create their own iGEM team next year, so that the iGEM IONIS team can last over time and become bigger and bigger !

It was originally intended to be hosted in La Paillasse, the lab where the iGEM IONIS team is working, and ended up being in the Pasteur campus.The iGEM IONIS team was in charge of designing the event’s logo, and its members were helping out teams as staff.
</P><P>6 teams were participating to this meetup, and spent a whole day of fun, with some conferences and project presentations, more in-depth than what has been done during the European Experience. The presentations were also assessed by some professionals and experts with different backgrounds (biology, engineering, design…), who were asking questions and investigating what the teams have been doing over their projects. Their detailed feed-back and reactions were very helpful and allowed us to see the different possible point of views about our projects !</P><P>Two conferences were also organized during the afternoon, and presented by two law students in the iGEM Pasteur team. They gave us an introduction of Intellectual Property, and how to manage it into the frame of Open Science. These were really helpful and helped us to have a better understanding of what the iGEM competition was about.
</P><P>After the conferences all the teams gathered outside to eat, drink and play together during a collaborative picnic. This event was the opportunity to talk with iGEMers from Paris and to exchange tips and advices for the future.This event, 1 month after the European Experience, was the perfect opportunity to hang out with our fellow iGEMers from all around Ile-de-France, and discover how every team was made, how they were working, and to share a few tips around a good drink ! We had a fantastic day, and everyone was happy in the end. We later met these teams again, (see Festival du Vivant), and it was always some great moments that we spent together !
</P><P>The smaller amount of people that were at this meetup allowed us to share more with them, and not only did we met fellow iGEMers, but we could also make friends with a lot of amazing people !</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="blog_top"><H4 class="blog_topHd" id="Brainstorming">

We then had various roles, going from road blocking to medal handling, through dicing fruits for the runners… We once had to run the main stand for the whole day, and welcomed every runner, gave them their bags, maps, etc ! We also had some more uncommon roles, such as helping bike runners go down stairs under the rain…
These events could sometimes be hard, but they always were very fun, and we were on a very good mood all day long: no matter how tired we were, everyone was here for a greater cause, and we got to meet very nice people there.
These events were also great occasions for team building and group cohesion, as we had to work together fast and efficiently, just like during the iGEM competition.</P><P>We helped the staff of these events:
