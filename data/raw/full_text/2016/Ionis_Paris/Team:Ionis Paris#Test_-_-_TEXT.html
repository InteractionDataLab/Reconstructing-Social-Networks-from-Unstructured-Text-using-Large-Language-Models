What is
Quantifly ?
(VOC)
VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
Nowadays, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are commonly found pollutants that have been proven                         present in a wide variety of everyday life situations. Though they are dangerous and present                         almost everywhere, VOCs are not efficiently detected. Usual detection devices are very unprecise                         or requires a very long exposure time.
Bacteria
Biosensor
This is why we developed the Quantifly project : a combination of a bacterial biosensor,                             perfectly adapted to on-field measurements, and an innovative drone that will allow us to                             easily and rapidly quantify the amount of VOCs in the air. The biosensor relies on                             bioluminescence, a biochemical phenomenon that is commonly used in cell imaging. We are                             trying to develop a new application for bioluminescence that should allow us to create a                             biosensor of a new kind, entirely different from the existing devices.
If you’ve followed along and done the steps above, you’ve created a good                             starting place. You’re going to need to make sure your pages are optimized properly.
Bacteria
Drone
Concerning the drone, it is designed to safely contain our organisms and carry them on the                             field, thus acting as a mobile detection platform.

OUR BEST INTER-TEAM
COLLABORATION
The European
Experience
In Paris 2/07/2016
The iGEM IONIS team and the iGEM Evry team worked together to accomplish a great gathering of the European teams: an European Jamboree ! We organized over a week-end a symposium with more than 150 people that could assist to conferences and expose their projects, and create great network through the iGEM competition. We also wanted to give all European teams the opportunity to live an incredible weekend, by coming to Paris and being able to live the “science dream” in the city of light !

A multidisciplinary team
The iGEM IONIS team is developping its                             project through different axes. We are focused on two areas :
the development of                             our prototype and the realisation of our own european jamboree, the European Experience.

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
