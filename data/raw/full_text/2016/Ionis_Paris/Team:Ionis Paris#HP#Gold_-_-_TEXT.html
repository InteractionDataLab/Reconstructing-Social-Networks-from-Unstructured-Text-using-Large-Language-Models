The European Experience
With the help of the iGEM Evry team, we organized a meeting gathering iGEM teams from all europe with many different and really interesting projects. A poster session was conducted, allowing networking and This european jamboree has been the opportunity to encounter professionnals of synthetic biology and to listen to conferences about the evolution and stakes of the discipline. With those scientific and professional activities, guests could also experience Paris during the day. A party was organized to tighten links between iGEMers, providing a week end of human and professionnal interaction !

Popularization
Mobile Application
Our mobile application was developped in order to popularise our project to a targetted population being unable to be in close contact with our team. In this objective, we worked on a game that would include the concepts of our product, such as pollution detection and bioluminescence reaction. We made a point of creating a game that people aged from 7 to 77 years old could enjoy, as te mechanics stay simple and the graphics are up to date with other mobile game applications that can be found on mobile platforms such sa iOS or Android.
