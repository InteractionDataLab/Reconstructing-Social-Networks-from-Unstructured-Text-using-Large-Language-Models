Protocol 5
Protocol 5 : Preparation of competent cells
Aim: Prepare competent bacteria for subsequent transformation
Inoculation
Inoculate 100µL of cells in 100mL LB medium
Let the culture grow O/N at 37°C
CaCl2 preparation
Put 1.11g of CaCl2 in 100mL of sterile H2O to obtain a final concentration of 0.1M of CaCl2 (Molar mass of Cacl2: 110,98g/mol)
Competency
Inoculate 3mL of the overnight culture cell from in 90mL of LB. Shake at 37°C until the DO is around 0,6
NB : all the following steps must be perform in ice
Transfer cells into sterile ice-cold Falcon tubes
Incubate on ice for 30 min
Spin cells at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 6°C
Discard supernatant and try to drain all remaining media
Gently resuspend in 10mL cold 0,1M CaCl2
Incubate on ice 20 min
Centrifuge 10 min at 4000 rpm at 4°C
Discard supernatant and vortex, gently resuspend on 5mL cold 0,1M CaCl2/15% Glycerol
Transfer in 2mL cryotubes
Store at -80°C for subsequent transformation
Reagents
E.coli DH5α or BL21
LB medium (see Protocol 1 :
Culture medium preparation)
CaCl2 (Panreac, 131232)
Glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich - G5516)
Materials
Sterile 1.5mL tubes
50mL falcon tube (VWR, 525-0156)
Cryotube (Dutscher 055003)
Spectrophotometer
Incubator
Centrifuge
Ice bucket

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
