Miniprep: on stock DH5⍺ transformed with BBX4
Objectives
Amplification of BBX4 plasmid extracted from bacterial mini-cultures in order to have a bigger stock of this plasmid.
Materials
1 Mini-culture of bacteria transformed with BBX4 realised the 06/10 (put 100 µL of stock bacteria transformed with BBX4 from 03/10 in 5 mL LB+Cm into a 50 mL Falcon tube). From this mini-culture, take 300 µL to realize a glycerol stock of tranformed bacteria. The 4.7 mL remaining will serve for the miniprep.
Protocol
The miniprep were realized using the QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit ( Qiagen, ref: 27104 )  and following the protocol given by the supplier.
Miniprep :
Divide the 4.7 mL bacterial O/N mini-cultures into 4 Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge all those tubes at 9,000 rpm for 3 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.
Resuspend the pellet in 62.5 μL Buffer P1 and pool the 4 Eppendorf tubes into a unique tube.
Add 250 μL Buffer P2 and mix by inverting the tube 6 times. The solution turns blue.
Add 350 μL Buffer N3 and mix by inverting the tube 6 times. The solution turns colorless.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm.
Load 800 μL supernatant from step 5 to the QIAprep 2.0 spin column. Centrifuge for 1 min and discard the flow-through.
Add 500 µL Buffer PB. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard the flow-through.
Add 750 µL Buffer PE. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard the flow-through.
Centrifuge once more for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
Place the QIAprep 2.0 spin column in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50 μL Buffer EB to the center of the QIAprep 2.0 spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
Calculate the quantity of DNA with the Nanodrop.
Store the purified DNA at -20°C.
Bacteria storage :
1.  Add 100 µL of glycerol 50% to 100 µL of transformed bacteria in clean microcentrifuge 1.5 mL Eppendorf.
3 tubes of BBX4
2.  Store at -80°C.

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
