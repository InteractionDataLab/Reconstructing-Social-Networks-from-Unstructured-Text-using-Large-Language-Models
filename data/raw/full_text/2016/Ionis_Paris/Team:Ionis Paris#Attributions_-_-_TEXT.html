We would like to thank all the people that were here for the project at some point: the team members, of course, but also our schools, our sponsors, the media that spoke about us and the people that were here to support us. We are going to try to list all of them here, to give them the credit they deserve.
The team
Ionis Igem
Schools
Our schools have been extensively supporting our project since the beginning, whether by funding it, granting us access to a lab, allowing some time for our presentations in the plannings, lending us the European Experience building, publishing articles about us… The IONIS education group took a big part in our project, and we are very proud that we managed to gather 6 IONIS to work on such a big scale project for the first time in history.

Sponsors
We’ve been helped by a lot of companies and organisms all along the project, and we couln’t have make it this far without them !
All of them have been very supportive toward our project.
IDT
IDT specializes in DNA synthesis, gene construction, antisense oligos, molecular beacons and a variety of molecular biology products. IDT is one of the iGEM 2016 main sponsors, and have offered us free DNA synthesis, which have been of great help throughout the project.
Geneious
Geneious  is a very powerful and comprehensive suite of molecular biology tools, allowing plasmid edition, assembly, alignments, and other very important in silico operations that we had to perform. We used the licenses geneious provided us on a daily basis, and are very grateful for their help
New England Biolabs
New England Biolabs provides enzymes and their reagents, along with powerful for molecular biology and genome editing. They are sponsoring iGEM teams every year, and have been sending us valuable kits and giving us discounts.
Qiagen
is a company selling molecular biology products and kits. They have been providing us free kits such as PCR Cleanups and Gel Extraction kits, ad have shown great support towards our project.
La Paillasse
We already said it in a dedicated section, but we would like to thank again the people from La Paillasse for hosting us in their open-lab. Everyone, staff and residents, have been really nice to us very supportive. We don’t know what our project would be without them.
INSERM
The INSERM, and in particular the U1138 Team 1, for their invaluable support during the project. They have given us advices, consumables, sequencing kits…They have been very helpful and available for us all along.
Ambassade de France aux États-Unis
We would like to thank the French Embassy in the United States for their help to the project: they have given us a financial support in order to promote collaborations in the field of research between France and the U.S.A, and so we did.

Heetch
Heetch is a French startup specialized in transportation that allowed every iGEMer to return home safely from the European Experience, through a quality service.
Vincennes
Vincennes is a Parisian suburb from where one of our team members is coming. They helped us to fund the project, and were really interested in its development all along.
City of Autouillet
Autouillet is a little village situated in the Parisian suburb. It is the hometown of one of our team members. They participated to the funding of our project, and were very nice !
Enveitg
Enveitg is the hometown of one of our team members. Though it is a small village, they were kind enough to help us !
Crowdfunding and fundraising
During this project, we had to do a lot of fundraising in order to gather enough money to complete the project.  As said in the “Events” section, we worked as staff for a few sport events, which was of great help. We also had the occasion to sell food on our campus in order to continue raise funds. The students were very understanding, and this was one more occasion to talk with them and to explain them what it is we were doing. All of these efforts were therefore put to good use, and were crowned by a big crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter, launched during August, that ended early September. For this campaign, we asked everyone to help us again, and managed to get more than 2 000€ for our project ! This was a great success for us, and we were all very happy about it.
Media
Both the European Experience and our project have raised great interest, especially in France, where air pollution is an ever increasing concern and exchanges are very important to peopls. Many newspapers, scientific or not, published articles about us ! We received a lot of messages and seeing the people’s interest for our project was really heartwarming. We tried to list below most of the articles:
Futura Sciences
Les Échos
Sciences et Avenir
Dimension Ingénieur
Le Festival Vivant
Ionis Group
AggloTV
L’usine nouvelle
Monde des grandes écoles

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantage of the multiple schools and fields of activity                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
