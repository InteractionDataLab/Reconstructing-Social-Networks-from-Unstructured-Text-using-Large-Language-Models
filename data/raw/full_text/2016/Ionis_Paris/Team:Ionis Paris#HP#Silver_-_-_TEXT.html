Project Genesis
Quantifly's birth
This section has the objective to show the project's creation process. Among differetn ideas ranging from water treatment to genetically engineered cells, our brainstormings were highly productive.
With many meetings and research sessions, we emerged with the ideal of answering a contemporary issue by creating an innovative solution, a tool that would implement biology as a mean of producing a challenging technology.
An that's how Quantifly was born !
Air Pollution
A summary
In order to conduct a meaningful project, we had to first establish the envionmental and scientific context of our topic. We did so by conceiving a survey about air pollution and mainly about V.O.Cs (Volatile Organic Compounds), a group of pollutant we chose to focus on.
This analysis allowed us to determine how important it is to fully understand our context, because it allows us to knowingly direct our project to a more pertinent and appropriate destination that would compete with already existing solutions to our problematic.
It's this way !
Our Opinion Survey
Use of G.M.Os with air pollution
Although we were preoccupied with the pertinence of our project compared to the issue we decided to adress, we also worried about how our product based on G.M.Os would be perceived by someone who would have nothing to do with science, as in our culture modified organismsn have known a difficult past.
As such, we designed and conducted an opinion survey about the use of genetically modified organisms in the detection of air pollution. the study was made by the team members and it was created in a way that we could gatherinformation about the potential of our project as well as how people see G.M.Os and what they think about it.
Survey's results are here !
Ethics & Biosafety
Risk assessment and Management
We could not create a new G.M.O-based product without thinking about the potential risks and issues that a leaking in the open environment could cause. We reflected about the risks that our project can carry and that allowed us to think about solutions that could prevent such problems to happen.
We also conducted a reflexion about the biological and mechanical questions inherent to our product and developped theoretical solutions that we can implement in further development. Those solutions provide a fully safe manipulation of our product in any environment.
Discover our solutions !
Our Actions
How did we spread the word ?
All along our project, we had several opportunities to participate in scientific conventions suh as the "Festival vivant" in Paris, France, as well as organize sensibilisation sessions on our campus. We tried to touch as many people as we could in order to have them discover what are the potentialities of synthetic biology and what we could do in the context of the iGEM or any other opportunity to develop a transdisciplinary project. Those events allowed us to have countless passionating discussions with professionnals and students that could ask us any question about our project.
Needless to say that we learned as much as they did !

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantage of the multiple schools and fields of activity                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
