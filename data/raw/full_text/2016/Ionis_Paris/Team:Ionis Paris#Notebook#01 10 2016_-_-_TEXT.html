Transformation: competent DH5⍺ cells with BBX4, BBC5 and BBC1
Objectives
The objective is to transform competent DH5⍺ cells with BBX4, BBC5 and BBC1 in order to create a stock of transformed bacteria.
Materials
3 aliquots of DH5⍺ competent cells (from the 20/09/16)
Plasmid DNA:
BBX4: “RBS - mRFP-his” (RBS - mRFP), 717bp , from the iGEM plate 5: 1F (BBa_K1491009)
BBC5: “GFP reporter for RHS of library test constructs”, from the iGEM plate 4: 11L (BBa_I1340)
BBC1: “Test Device 1” (Preference - RBS - GFP - Term ; J23101.B0034.E0040.B0015)
Petri dish LB+Cm: Cm concentration = 25 µg/mL
Protocol
Experimental conditions realized:
Transformation Protocol:
Thaw tubes of DH5⍺ competent cells on ice for 10 min. Mix gently and carefully pipette 50 µL of cells into the 4 transformation tubes on ice.
Add the 1 µL (200/300ng) plasmid DNA to the cell mixture.
Carefully flick the tubes 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.
Place on ice for 30 min. Do not mix.
Heat shock at exactly 42°C for 45 s. Do not mix.
Place on ice for 5 min. Do not mix.
Pipette 250 µL of room temperature SOC into the mixture.
Place at 37°C for 1h at 250 rpm.
Warm selection plates to 25°C.
Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tubes and inverting.
Spread the corresponding volume onto each plate.
Incubate all the plates O/N at 37°C.
Results (obtained on the 02/10)
Expected results:
Some colonies on the petri dishes LB+Cm plated with 50 µL of bacteria transformed with the different ligation products and more on the petri dishes LB+Cm plated with 200 µL of bacteria.
A bacterial lawn on the LB petri dishes without antibiotic.
No colonies on the LB+Cm petri dish plated with bacteria transformed with no plasmid (- control).
Obtained results:
We obtained expected results.
Interpretation
The transformations worked. Colonies incorpore the plasmid with the Chloramphenicol resistance gene, present in pSB1C3.

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
