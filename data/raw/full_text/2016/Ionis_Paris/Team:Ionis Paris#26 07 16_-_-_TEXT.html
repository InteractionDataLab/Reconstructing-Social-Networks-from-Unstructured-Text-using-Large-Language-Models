Ligation of P2 and P3 in pSB1C3 to obtain BB2 and BB3 :
Objectives
Ligation of P2 and P3 into pSB1C3 in order to obtain BB2 and BB3 biobricks for subsequent transformations and creation of a stock of bacteria. Different ligation ratios are going to be tested : 1:1, 1:2, 1:3. The molar ratios for the ligations were calculated using NEB BioCalculator (available here )

Materials
11 Mini-cultures of bacteria transformed with BB1 realised the 25/07 (put a colony with satisfying PCR results in 5 mL LB+CHL into a 50 mL Falcon tube).
From those mini-cultures, take 500 µL to realize a glycerol stock of tranformed bacteria. The 4.5 mL remaining will serve for the miniprep.

The miniprep were realized using the QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, ref: 27104)  and following the protocol given by the supplier (available here )
Miniprep:
Divide each 4.5 mL bacterial O/N mini-cultures into 4 Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge all those tubes at 9,000 rpm for 3 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.
Resuspend the pellet in 62.5 μL Buffer P1 and pool the 4 Eppendorf tubes into a unique tube.
Add 250 μL Buffer P2 and mix by inverting the tube 6 times. The solution turns blue.
AAdd 350 μL Buffer N3 and mix by inverting the tube 6 times. The solution turns colorless.

iGEM IONIS
We're a group of six different schools from the IONIS Education Group. For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
