                                     Principle OF THE BIOBRICK DESIGN IN AN IGEM CONTEXT
                                    </H4></DIV><H3>Biobrick definition</H3><P>In the context of iGEM, our genetic circuit, encoded as a plasmid, is defined as a BioBrick. The different elements of the genetic circuit contribute to the function of the BioBrick. In the iGEM registry, we can distinguish 2 components that compose a plasmid: the plasmid backbone and the BioBrick part (see Figure 2).</P></DIV><DIV class="related_post"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="related_post_top clearfix"><DIV class="col-xs-12 col-sm-7"><DIV class="blog_top"><P><I>Figure 1: General structure of a BioBrick (source <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Plasmid_backbones/Assembly">here </A>)</I></P><P>For the assembly of our biobrick we use the BioBrick RFC[10] assembly standard because it is the standard of the IGEM competition and most of the parts available on the registry match this standard. The BioBrick RFC[10] assembly standard is based on the use of a prefix and a suffix placed at the extremities of each part to be assembled in order to obtain standard BioBricks that are compatible and thus can be easily assembled.</P></DIV><DIV class="blog"><H3>Biobrick RFC[10] assembly standard </H3></DIV><LI><P>Prefix and suffix</P></LI><P>Prefix and suffix provide a method to obtain standard genetic construction. Their exact sequences are available in Figure 2. Each one includes two different restriction sites: </P><UL><LI><P> - EcoRI and XbaI in the prefix</P></LI><LI><P> - SpeI and PstI in the suffix</P></LI></UL><P>For protein coding regions (that starts with ATG), there is an adapted prefix.</P><P><I>Figure 2: Prefix and suffix sequences</I></P><P>All components of the genetic circuit are added to the system with these prefix and suffix. Once added to the system, in order to be compatible with the RFC[10] standard, a part does not have to contain these four restriction sites, they have to be unique to the prefix and suffix.</P><LI><P>Assembling method</P></LI></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><P><I>Figure 3: Assembling method</I></P><LI><P>Scar</P></LI><P>The use of this assembling method leaves a scar between the 2 assembled parts, with the following DNA sequence:
  - 5'  [part A]  TACTAGAG  [part B]  3’.
When using the alternate prefix in the case of the assembling of a RBS with a protein coding region, the scar DNA sequence would be:
  - 5'  [part A]  TACTAG  [part B, that starts with ATG] 3’.
</P><P>The only disadvantage of the RFC[10] assembly standard is the impossibility to make fusion proteins. The 6bp scar includes a stop codon and the 8bp scar includes a frame-shift and a stop codon. The alternative to this problem is to use a scar-less assembly method or DNA synthesis. </P><H3>Biobrick part</H3><P>The biobrick part is composed of the sequence located between the prefix and the suffix. This sequence includes the devices that will perform the given functions in the cell (i.e protein production). 
Each device is a composite part, which means it is composed of several basic parts assembled together to ensure a specific function. A basic part is a single functional unit coding for a basic biological function and cannot be split into smaller units. Promoters, coding sequences or RBSs are examples of basic parts. Two parts make up our device: one in charge of the XylR protein synthesis and one in charge of the<I>Gaussia</I> luciferase synthesis.</P><DIV class="blog"><H3>Plasmid backbone</H3></DIV><P>The plasmid backbone is the sequence that begins with the suffix and ends with the prefix. The plasmid backbone mainly serves as support for the propagation of the biobrick part. It includes the origin of replication and the antibiotic resistance marker.
The presence of the antibiotic resistance marker in the backbone allows the selection of only clones that incorporate the plasmid thanks to an antibiotic in the medium. Clones that do not incorporate the plasmid do not have the antibiotic resistance and thus cannot survive in the selective medium. 
In the iGEM competition, a set of 4 linearized plasmid backbones is sent to each team: pSB1A3, pSB1C3, pSB1K3.m1, and pSB1T3. They respectively include these 4 antibiotics: Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, Kanamycin and Tetracycline.

All the plasmid backbone used for the competition are provided with a default insert: the ccdb gene. This gene can be used as a marker to establish whether the plasmid backbone have been successfully digested. If not, the cell death gene will remain in the plasmid backbone and kill the kill the transformed bacteria. The ccdb gene ensures to not keep cells transformed with the uncut plasmid during the assembly of two BioBrick parts.
As already specified, the presence of the antibiotic resistance marker in the backbone allows the selection of clones that incorporated the plasmid.

The A domain of the XylR protein (sensing domain), binds to the pollutant molecule. This leads to the formation of a tetramer. The C domain is involved in the dimerization of XylR, which is ATP dependent. The made up tetramer acts as an activator transcriptional factor for the Pu promoter through the DNA binding D domain.</P><P><I>Figure 8: The XylR CDS structure</I></P><DIV class="blog"><P>Pu promoter</P></DIV><P>Pu is a promoter found in the toluene recognition system and is composed of 320 bp.

We chose to use this promoter because of its sensibility to the transcriptional regulator XylR bound to xylene, toluene or 1-chloro-3-methyl-benzene.</P><DIV class="blog"><H3>GLuc gene</H3></DIV><P>This gene is found in a well-known organism, the copepod Gaussia princeps. It encodes for the Gaussia luciferase enzyme, also known as GLuc, which is involved in a bioluminescence process. This enzyme degrades its substrate, coelenterazine, into a product, celenteramide. With an optimal substrate level, this step produces energy in the form of light that can be detected with a fixed spectrophotometer at 488nm.</P><P>We chose to use the GLuc-His part, a gene of 522 bp, available on the iGEM registry at the (BBa_K1732027) which codes for the Gaussia luciferase followed by 6 histidines and optimized it for E.coli. In our plasmid, this gene is positioned after an inducible promoter, the Pu promoter, to report the activation of the toluene recognition system.

The Gaussia luciferase needs the addition of substrate to ensure its activity because this molecule is not synthetized by our biosensor. Therefore, in the laboratory, luciferase substrate can be added at the same time in each sample ensuring that every measurement will be taken at the same time. This allow a better consistency between our different results. Also, due to its secreted form, lysing cells in order to assay GLuc activity is not necessary.</P><P>The Gaussia luciferase is an ideal reporter gene because of its stability at high temperature thanks to disulfide bonds and because it has extremely high activity in light production for very sensitive assays. When compared to Firefly and Renilla luciferase, GLuc generates over 1000-fold higher bioluminescent signal intensity[1][2]. The NanoLuc has an activity a little higher but this luciferase is very recent and thus less characterized.</P><P>Advantages of luminescence, over fluorescence, include the absence of background noise, the amplification of signal and a high dynamic range that spans many orders of magnitude. Indeed, since light emission depends strictly on the chemical reaction between the substrate and the luciferase, there is no background noise originating from the sample [3]. Furthermore, the turnover of the light reaction significantly amplifies the reporter signal. Even though bioluminescence is currently used mainly for transcription study and cell imaging, this method become increasingly popular for quantitative analysis.</P><P>Even though bioluminescence is currently used mainly for transcription study and cell imaging, this method become increasingly popular for quantitative analysis.

This RBS, a sequence of 15 bp, has an efficiency of 0.6.This type of RBS allows a high translation rate that leads to a high protein production. However, a too high production can be harmful for the organism because a lot of proteins could be unfolded or misfolded.</P><LI><P>Middle RBS: </P></LI><P>An example of Middle RBS is available on the iGEM registry at this ID access: BBa_B0032.

In our project, we chose to use the stronger RBS, the Elowitz RBS (BBa_B0034), in order to have a maximal production rate. Indeed, as we already specified, the induced luminescence has to be proportional to the pollutant rate. Therefore, when pollutant molecules enter in the bacteria, the XylR protein has to be present in an enough amount and the Gaussia luciferase has to be produced rapidly in an amount that is proportional to the pollutant amount. This allows a luminescent response corresponding to the pollutant rate.
                                    </P><DIV class="blog"><H3>Double terminator</H3></DIV><P>A terminator is a genetic part placed at the end of a gene, in order to end transcription thanks to a stop codon. Several types of terminators exists but the most used are forward terminators. In general, some RNA polymerases will continue the transcription after the terminator, thus the terminator efficiency is not 100% in the most cases.
In order to increase the terminator efficiency in our plasmid we chose to use a double terminator. We selected two different double terminators that we have to test.
