Prizes
Our
success
This year, we won a Gold Medal for our Quantifly project. This is a really important achievement for us as it embodies the fact that we managed to create a functional multidisciplinary project from A to Z within a year.
Our
Nominations
Our team was also nominated for the following prizes : « Best Environmental Project » , « Best Applied Design » and « Best Presentation ». These nominations were very rewarding for a relatively recent team like us, and we are very proud that we managed to stand out next to very big teams.

For this                                     competition we wanted to take advantage of the multiple schools and fields of activity                                     given by the IONIS education group to create a solid project.
