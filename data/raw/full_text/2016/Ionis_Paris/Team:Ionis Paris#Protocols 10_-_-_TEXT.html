Protocol 11
Protocol 11: Site directed Mutagenesis
Aim: Modify a given section of a plasmid
Exponential Amplification
Prepare the following reaction mix:
Perform a thermocycling as follows:
Initial denaturation: 98°C for 30s
25 cycles of :
- 98°C 10s
- Provided Ta temperature 10-30s
- 72°C; 20/30S per kB (amplification)
72°C for 2 min
Hold: 4°C
Qsp 30 µL RNAse-free H2O
KLD Reaction
Prepare the following reaction mix:
Incubate for 5 min at room temperature
Transformation
Add 5 μl of KLD mix to 50 μl of chemically-competent cells.
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
Heat shock at 42°C for 30 seconds.
Incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
Add 950 μl SOC, gently shake at 37°C for 1 hour.
Spread 40–100 μl onto appropriate selection plate, incubate overnight at 37°C.
