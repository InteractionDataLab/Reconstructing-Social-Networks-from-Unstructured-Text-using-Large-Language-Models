Workshops
Our team played an integral role in conducting a National Workshop “Contemperory Research in Genetic Engineering” organized by Department of Biotechnology, SVCE. It was a two day workshop held on 9th and 10th September ’16 and was sponsored by DBT- New Delhi, GOI and Indian Council Of  Medical Research – New Delhi. Over 100 participants from all over India enrolled for the workshop.
Our senior lab team members took a break from their lab duties to teach participants the techniques we use in our project such as restriction, ligation, PCR reactions, competent cells preparation, transformation and plasmid isolation.
Students were briefed about the different cloning strategies such as the 3A assembly, Gibson assembly and amplified insert assembly, further stating the advantages and disadvantages of them, and under which conditions a particular technique is preferred. Students were also taught primer designing and how to use the various software tools available at their disposal.
Later, our PI addressed all the participants and introduced them to iGEM and its goals and how synthetic biology is an emerging field. Members of our human practices team also presented our project to the participants and answered their questions regarding our project.
