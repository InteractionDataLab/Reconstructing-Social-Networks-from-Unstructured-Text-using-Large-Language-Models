URBAN SURVEY
According to the NDDB(National Dairy Development Board) India is the largest producer of milk, which means that we're also wasting milk the most. So, in order to better understand the dynamics of milk spoilage ,our human practices team  conducted a survey among 620 people of varying age,region, economic background and nutritional requirements to analyze on what level milk spoilage affected them and to predict what the response would be to the solution proposed by SVCE_CHENNAI. Among the 620 people who took the survey, it was observed that 95% drank milk everyday thereby substantiating that milk plays an imperative role in fulfilling their nutritional requirements. It was observed that 50.2% had some of their milk wasted due to spoilage. However this was not equally distributed in the population set, as people who were well above the poverty line had access to refrigerators and consistent supply of electricity, and hence were able to prevent milk spoilage by refrigeration . However those people whose income subjected them to being on the poverty line or below it were often incapable of affording refrigerators or did not have a proper supply of electricity in their houses even if they were equipped with refrigerators thereby rendering them dysfunctional
When asked on what level milk spoilage needed a solution, about 60% thought that the situation would be much better if there was a solution and about 30% thought that it is absolutely necessary that there is a solution, hence we can infer that about 90% of the people believe that  milk spoilage needs a solution.
To the same population, SVCE_CHENNAI proposed our solution to see how the population would respond if our system was optimized and commercialized, by asking them corresponding questions. While 83% of the population said they’d use this system, among them 82% said they will use it only if its been approved by a regulatory body such as the fssai(food safety and standards authority of India).About half the population was concerned about the use of biological molecules(peptides),as they were worried if there would be some side affects or if the peptides would in any way compromise the integrity of milk or disturb its consistency. Further it was observed tha ta majority of the people wanted the system to cost less than Rs.10 and be effective for more than 5 hours.
Hence, based on these observations, its safe to assume that the system designed by SVCE_CHENNAI would be used by a faction of the society that’s looking for a method to prevent milk spoilage in the lack of refrigeration conditions provided the system has been approved by a regulatory body, costs below Rs.10 and  effectively prevents milk spoilage for more than five hours.
