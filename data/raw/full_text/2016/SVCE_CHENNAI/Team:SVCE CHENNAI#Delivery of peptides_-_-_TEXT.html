The need for an effective delivery system:
Once the peptides have been synthesized there is a need to make sure that only the antimicrobial peptides enter the milk,and not the medium, host organism or other proteins. Ergo,there was a necessity for a system that would selectively only allow the release of the antimicrobial peptides.
Thank you Team Groiningen!
We didn't have to look far for such a system ,as the - 2012 Groningen team had designed a system as a part of their project that suited our needs. However,we had to find an alternative to the TPX membrane they used as their outer layer as our antimicrobial peptide have a size of 1.05kDa without the glycine residues and 1.16kDa with the glycine residues. Dialysis membranes served as the best alternative for TPX as they can be constructed with a pore size of ~1kDa.The diagram below depicts the system, the outer dialysis membrane of size 1kDa and the inner PVC membrane.
