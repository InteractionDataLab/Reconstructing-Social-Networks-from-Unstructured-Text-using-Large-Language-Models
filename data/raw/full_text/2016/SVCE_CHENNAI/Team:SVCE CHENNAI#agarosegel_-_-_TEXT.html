Gel electrophoresis
Requirements for each sample:
  Elution buffer (0.5 M sodium acetate (pH 7) and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8))
  95% ethanol
  80% ethanol
  TE buffer (10x) (pH 8.0)
  Gel fragment containing the DNA
Procedure:
  Excise the region of the gel containing the required DNA band using a scalpel.
  Add elution buffer to the gel slice until the level of the buffer is a few mm above the level of the excised gel band.
  Heat the solution in a water bath at 65ᵒ C until the agarose completely melts.
 Fast-freeze by placing in a -80ᵒ C freezer for 10-15 minutes.
  Immediately thaw the solution by centrifuging for 10 minutes.
 The supernatant is transferred to a new tube.
 Add elution buffer again to the pellet and repeat the steps 3-6.
 Accumulate the supernatants and add an equal volume of 1-butanol.
 Rock the mixture for 15 minutes to remove the EtBr completely from the gel.
 Discard the supernatant and repeat the steps 8 and 9 2-3 times.
