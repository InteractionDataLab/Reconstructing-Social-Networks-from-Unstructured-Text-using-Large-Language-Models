Given that biotechnology is an emerging and still nascent field in India, we felt the need to create awareness among school students and educate them about the potential of biotechnology. We spoke to them about iGEM, its goals, synthetic biology and it’s the socio-economic impact it can have. Further we presented our project to them, illustrating to them an example of how a real life problem can be solved using synthetic biology.
We facilitated knowledge sharing about synthetic biology through flash cards, quizzes and other games. In Bertrand Russell Nursery & Primary School, Laurel Higher Secondary School, Five Star Matric Higher Secondary School we interacted primary and higher secondary school students and made them aware of the potential of synthetic biology and iGEM. We also interacted with the teachers of these schools and considered the possibility of them teaching the basics of biotechnology along with conventional biology.
Also, the Human practices team of Team SVCE_CHENNAI joined hands with Team IISC Bangalore and presented our respective projects to high school students of biotechnology at  Vidhya Mandir. Members of both the teams explained our projects together and the students expressed great inquisitiveness and also educated the students about some basic cloning stratergies in synthetic biology.
We evaluated the student’s knowledge before and after presentation by conducting Pre and Post Questionnaires.
We also discussed about a couple of fascinating projects of other iGEM teams(Probeeotics:British Columbia,iGEM 2015 &Colisweeper: ETH Zuich,iGEM 2012 Groningen).
At the end of our presentation, we were obliged to know that the students have gained some fundamental knowledge on synthetic biology and also enjoyed the whole session.As a whole human practices sessions in school ended up with educating the Class 12 students with various opportunities that were available in the stream of Biology background.
