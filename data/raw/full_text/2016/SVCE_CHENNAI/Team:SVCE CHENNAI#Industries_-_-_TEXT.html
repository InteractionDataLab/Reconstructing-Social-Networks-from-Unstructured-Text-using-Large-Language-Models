Industries
Paskey Farms,pvt ltd.
LOCATION : Kanchipuram
GUIDED BY : Mr.Dhilip Khanna
DESIGNATION : Chief officer-operation
OPINIONS AND SUGGESTIONS GIVEN BY HIM :
   The whole process taking place in the industry which included the analyzation of the milk quality and the production of different varieties of milk (homogenized and non-homogenised milk) and milk derivatives(cottage cheese and ghee) were explained in detail by  Mr.Dhilip Khanna.
   Utilization of our AMPs to control the microbial flora during curd and cottage cheese manufacture was a valid point suggested by him.
   Our project was also stated as a potential way to manage huge economic losses incurred due to spoilage of milk.
  They agreed to offer support, both technical and financial, to the team.
Kwality Milk Foods.
LOCATION : Kanchipuram
GUIDED BY : Mr.Chandrasekar
DESIGNATION : Senior Manager
OPINIONS AND SUGGESTIONS GIVEN BY HIM :
   Information about the different parameters being considered in the industry to prevent contamination viz.,maintaining proper transport duration and storing at low temperatures were told by Mr.Chandrasekar.
   He also told us about the qualitative tests such as the MBRT(methylene blue reduction test), and the SNF test which are being carried out to decrease contamination.
   Suggestions for B.subtilis sporulation were given as follows:
   Heating of the medium containing spores at 60-70 degrees for about 20 mins.
   Inoculation of the spores in a fresh medium in order to turn it into vegetative form.
   Spore staining using malachite green stain to confirm the presence of spores.
Raaj Milk Industry
LOCATION : Dindigul
OPINIONS AND SUGGESTIONS GIVEN :
   Quantitative data on the amount of milk received ,amount of milk getting processed and amount of milk sent out as product were given by them.
   Information was also provided on the types of milk being produced such asFull cream,Standardized ,toned, and double-toned milk.
   We were told that our project plays may play a major role in the industry level where it will be used to eradicate the microbial contamination at undesirable places.
   Optimisation of our product cost which should be preferably around INR 5 was also suggested.
   We were also insisted to work on the prolongation of the time period to which our peptides will exert their action.
Vijay Dairy Farms
LOCATION : Trichy
OPINIONS AND SUGGESTIONS GIVEN :
   To focus on yeast and molds and to produce AMPs for other milk-based products and even for water if possible.
   To optimize the minimal inhibitory concentration(MIC) of our AMPs.
   To develop AMPs that are specific to only the harmful microbes in the milk without affecting the essential microbes in it.
   To check the diffusivity of the growth medium.
   To work on alternate delivery designs.
Hatsun Agro Products Limited.
LOCATION : Kanchipuram
GUIDED BY : Mr.Kapil Rajr
DESIGNATION : Chief Superintendent
OPINIONS AND SUGGESTIONS GIVEN BY :
   A brief outline of the production process starting from the pre-liminary tests to the final checks done before packaging was elaborated by Mr.Kapil Raj.
   Marketing of our final product by the means of collaborating with some small-scale milk industries was suggested by him.
   He stated that our project will be a great boon to the rural milk vendors who can make use of it to prevent contamination of their milk while they bring it to the collection centres.
   To check the diffusivity of the growth medium through the membranes.
   We were also advised to work on the enhancement of the half-life of our peptides and also on the cost-efficiency of our product.
INFERENCE
From all the suggestions and information described above,we can infer the following points:
   The milk industries are also in need of a better solution to control the microbial contamination of their milk.
   They are very much concerned about the cost of the product.
   They also want us to work on the half-life of our peptides and ensure the prevention of spoilage for atleast a day or two.
   They want us to increase the spectrum of activity of our peptides with enhanced prevention even against some kind of fungi.
   They are concerned about the potential changes that may be caused by the AMPs to the integrity of the milk.
