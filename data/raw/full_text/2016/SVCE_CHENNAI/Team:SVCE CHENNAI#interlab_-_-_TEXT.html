Interlab
Our team SVCE_Chennai participated in the Plate reader interlab study that iGEM conducted. Interlab is conducted to observe and compare the measurement methods throughout the world. It consists of two measurements, Plate Reader and Flow Cytometry in which we followed the Plate Reader Measurement.The interlab study is mainly based on the measurement of fluorescence data from three different GFP expressing constitutive promoter along with a positive and negative devices.The measurements were obtained from UV spectrophotometry and Fluorimeter and the results were interpreted and compared for the relative efficiency of expressing GFP in three different constitutive promotors.
Constructs
   Positive control
   Negative control
   Device 1:
   J23101 + I13504 in pSB1C3
   Device 2:
   J23106 + I13504 in pSB1C3
   Device 2:
   J23117 + I13504 in pSB1C3
Result
Absorbance value at 600nm for the Devices Vs Time
The graph indicates the absorbance value at 600 nm for the devices every1 hour.
We inferred that :
   Device 1 consists of the least Absorbance value compared to the other devices followed by Positive Control , Device 2, Negative Control and Device 3.
Fluorescence Measurement Of the Devices Vs Time
The graph indicates the flourescnce measurement of the 5 devices.
The results were interpreted as :
   Device 2 showed the maximum fluorescence as the time increased where as Device 1 showed high fluorescence at the first hour and remained the same as the time increased, Device 3 showed the least fluorescence compared to the 3 devices.
   Fluorescence was also increased in Positive control and showed minimal fluorescence in Negative Control.
Flourescence/Absorbance (600nm) Vs Time
The bar graph indicates the difference between the devices in the 6 hours.
