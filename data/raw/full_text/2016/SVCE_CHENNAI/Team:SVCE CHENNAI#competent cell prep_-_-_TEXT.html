Competent cells preparation
Requirements:
  Detergent-free, sterile glassware and plasticware
  Table-top OD600nm spectrophotometer
  SOB
 CCMB Buffer
Procedure:
  Inoculate 250 ml of SOB medium with 1 ml vial of seed stock and grow at 20°C to an OD600nm of 0.3. Use the "cell culture" function on the Nanodrop to determine OD value. OD value = 600nm Abs reading x 10
  Fill an ice bucket halfway with ice. Use the ice to pre-chill as many flat bottom centrifuge bottles as needed.
  Transfer the culture to the flat bottom centrifuge tubes. Weigh and balance the tubes using a scale
 Centrifuge at 3000g at 4°C for 10 minutes in a flat bottom centrifuge bottle.
  Decant supernatant into waste receptacle, bleach before pouring down the drain.
 Gently resuspend in 80 ml of ice cold CCMB80 buffer
 Incubate on ice for 20 minutes
 Centrifuge again at 3000G at 4°C. Decant supernatant into waste receptacle, and bleach before pouring down the drain.
  Resuspend cell pellet in 10 ml of ice cold CCMB80 buffer.
  Use Nanodrop to measure OD of a mixture of 200 μl SOC and 50 μl of the resuspended cells
  Add chilled CCMB80 to yield a final OD of 1.0-1.5 in this test.
 Incubate on ice for 20 minutes. Prepare for aliquoting
  Aliquot into chilled 2ml microcentrifuge tubes or 50 μl into chilled microtiter plates
 Store at -80°C indefinitely.
 Test competence by measuring O.D
 Thawing and refreezing partially used cell aliquots dramatically reduces transformation efficiency by about 3x the first time, and about 6x total after several freeze/thaw cycles.
