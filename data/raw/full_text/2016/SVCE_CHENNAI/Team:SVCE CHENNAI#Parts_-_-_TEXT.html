OVERVIEW OF PARTS
Range: BBa_K2113001-BBa_K2113010
BASIC PARTS:
   Parts BBa_K2113004 and Part BBa_K2113005 are basic parts, coding for the antimicrobial peptides,the former without glycine and the later with glycine. A variant with extra glycine residues is used to increase the half life of the peptide, consistent with the N-end rule.

COMPOSITE PARTS:
   Parts BBa_K2113001 is a composite part coding for a RNA thermometer followed by expression of chromoprotein cj blue,this can be used for the characterization of RNA thermometer under different promoters.
   Parts BBa_K2113002 is a composite part that serves as a temperature sensitive system with a lambda pr promoter under cI regulation. BBa_K2113003 similarly is a temperature sensitive system with a RNA thermometer.
   Parts BBa_K2113007 and BBa_K2113008 are composite parts regulating the expression of basic parts BBa_K2113004 and BBa_K2113005 under a lac promoter, so that the system gets activated in the presence of milk.
   Part BBa_K2113006 contains a strong promoter regulating part BBa_k211301 downstream of which a double terminator is present. BBa_K2113009 and BBa_K2113010 are composite parts regulating the expression of basic parts BBa_K2113004 and BBa_K2113005 under a RNA thermometer.
