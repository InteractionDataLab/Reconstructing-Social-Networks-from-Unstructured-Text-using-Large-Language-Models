Safety
We worked in a BSL1 lab, and received training from our PI on handling hazardous substances.  We reviewed proper safety precautions as well as proper disposal of hazardous chemicals.  We also learned to deal with accidents such as spillages or injuries during experiments.  Finally, our team learned how to properly care for and use lab materials so that they will continue to work properly won't be a danger to those working in the lab.
​
The lab our team uses is at our school, so teachers are responsible for safety and provided our safety training.  The lab our team is using is located at our school, so the teachers are responsible for safety and provided the safety training.  The lab requires that an instructor be present at all times and that proper attire (closed-toed shoes, goggles, etc.) be worn during experiments.  Our lab also requires us to be aware of where the fire extinguisher, fire blanket, eyewash, and first aid kit are located.  The lab has strict rules on how to handle and dispose of chemicals properly and properly storing lab equipment and experiments.  Finally, the lab requires that we properly handle and care for lab equipment to ensure that it doesn't break or serve as a threat to those working in the lab.
