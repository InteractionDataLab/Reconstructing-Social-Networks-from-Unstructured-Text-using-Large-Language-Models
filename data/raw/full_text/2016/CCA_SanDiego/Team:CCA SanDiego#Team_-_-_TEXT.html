Julia Wisnia
I am a rising junior at Canyon Crest Academy.  My passion for biological sciences lead me to iGEM; I was excited to engage in the topics my advisors study.  This year I was introduced to computational methods for performing experiments that I had recently thought to be strictly wet lab.  Our mentors taught us to use programs such as VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) to model glucose and its sensor in a variety of environments.  I hope to continue on to the biomedical engineering field using both classical and computational approaches.  I would like to continue to pursue the construction of new biosensors in my future work.
