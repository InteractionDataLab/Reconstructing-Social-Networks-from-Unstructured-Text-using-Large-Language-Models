Collaborations
Our team collaborated with the high school team Nanjing_NFLS. The team is from the Nanjing Foreign Language School in China, and together we discussed our projects. We worked on characterizing a part as well as debugging a construct. We received valuable input from this collaboration and were able to give team Nanjing_NFLS feedback on their project as well.
