Our team would like to thank our mentors, Erinn Eddingfield, Ed Gerstin, and Ariel Haas for their guidance throughout our project. These mentors provided us with insight as we developed our project, guidance as we worked to develop and implement lab procedures, and support throughout the year.
We would like to thank Professor Frederick Guengerich, Vanderbilt University for the plasmid our team worked with and for his guidance on our project. We are also grateful toward Professor Chul-Ho Yun of Chonnam National University for his advice in the early stages of our project.
We would also like to thank Cymer for their generous contribution to the Canyon Crest Academy iGEM team, as well as the Canyon Crest Academy Foundation for working closely with us in order to fund our project.
We are incredibly grateful to New England Biolabs for their materials contribution, as well as Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) for their help in synthesizing custom DNA or use in our project.
