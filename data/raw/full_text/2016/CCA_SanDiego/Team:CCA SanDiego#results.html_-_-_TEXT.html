Cloning
We successfully incorporated the CYP2e1 gene alongside the required NADPH P450 reductase gene in a bicistronic construct for coexpression in bacteria. The aim is to use this construct for bioremediation purposes through expression in E. Coli.
Positive control (LB with bacteria only)
Negative control (LB and amp with bacteria only)
LB with bacteria transformed with plasmid
Selective plate (LB and amp with bacteria transformed with plasmid)
Isolating the Gene
We then moved on to isolating the gene. We digested the plasmid with restriction enzymes and ran our plasmid in a gel. The picture below shows the gel, confirming the successful isolation of our gene.
