BRONZE​
CCA_SanDiego is registered, and excited to be attending the 2016 Jamboree!
Check out all the people who helped us on attributions .
We documented the application of a previous Biobrick part:  BBa_K799027​ . The biobrick was successfully expressed in conjunction with NADPH P450 Reductase for bioremediation purposes.
SILVER
We had so much fun volunteering with the local elementary school Biology Olympiad team-- check it out !
!Our collaboration with Nanjing_NFLS was a huge help in our project.  We were able to discuss different strategies on approaching our project, and how best to isolate the target areas of our plasmid.  They were also a great resource to bounce ideas back and forth from, and we tried to do the same for them.
