1. Human Practices: reached out to Dr. Meng Lu from Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science for background research; visited the plant of Sanyuan Milk Group to see the process of sampling and testing the milk transported from individual farms, before they accept the milk; introduced the concept of synthetic biology and our project to the junior class of our school.

1. Integrated Human Practices: With the advice and information provided by Dr. Meng, we redesigned the fluorescence spectrophotometer to further reduce the cost and make our project, if commercialized, more accessible.
2. Proof of Concept: Our 3 new devices can generate the protein as we desire, our project built with the proteins can perform under the most simplified conditions.
3. Demonstrate our work: Our project can work under real-world conditions—detect the concentration of penicillin in milk samples.
