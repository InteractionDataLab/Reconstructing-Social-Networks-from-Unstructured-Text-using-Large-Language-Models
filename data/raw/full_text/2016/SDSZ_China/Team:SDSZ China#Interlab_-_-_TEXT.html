This is the first year we participate in the InterLab Study. The goal was to quantify expression of five different reporter constructs. These constructs have GFP under the control of different promoter and ribosome binding sequences (RBS).
We quantified the expression of GFP in comparable or absolute units, using Enspire Perkinelmer 2300, according to the InterLab Plate Reader Protocol. The devices we measured are Device 1: J23101+I13504, Device 2: J23106+I13504, Device 3: J23117+I13504, positive control, and negative control from the InterLab Measurement Kit.
