Test What You Can't TASTE
Integrated Practice
With the information gathered from research and outreach, we understand that our approach would bring out the best outcome if we make it as cheap and accessible as possible. So we want to seek ways to slightly modify the way to measure the enzymic activity, and make it more cost-effective.
Since testing fluorescence intensity only requires wave lengths from 450nm to 490nm, we redesigned the spectrophotometer, using Charge Coupled Device, so that it emit monochromatic light that only excites green fluorescence, and the cost of manufacturing would be much cheaper compared to the usual ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometers used in labs. (See more in project optimization).
This combined with our 1.0 approach with PBP5-GFP (see more in project 1.0), can be specifically used to detect penicillin residues. And Dr. Dao He, a physics teacher in our school with a PhD in nuclear physics at Tsing Hua University, thinks our new design is viable if some tech company help manufacture the light-emitting component. Unfortunately we do not have enough time to find such a manufacturer, but as we work toward the commercialization of our project, we have confidence our new penicillin detection method has the potential of being applied to poor areas of the country, probably in every “Milk Bar” or small-scale farm, because purchasing a test machine will no longer be impossible, so that everyone in China has a better chance at drinking qualified milk.
