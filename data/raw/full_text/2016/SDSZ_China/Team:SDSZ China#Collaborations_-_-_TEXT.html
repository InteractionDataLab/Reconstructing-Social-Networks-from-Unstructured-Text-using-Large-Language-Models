FAFU-CHINA
BNDS_China
Intro:
Starting this summer, we have formed connections and maintained communications with other high school and collegiate teams, and we are glad that we could offer our help to some of the teams, and happy to receive theirs.
FAFU-CHINA:
We helped FAFU-CHINA contact Zady Cytille, an international graduate student from Cote d’Ivoire, now studying in the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, to introduce their project and get feedback from him based on the conditions of his home country. ( See also )
BNDS_China:
We provided our TAKARA restriction enzymes to BNDS_China to help them with double enzyme digestion. Since high school teams do not usually have the financial support from school, most of the lab materials used by BNDS are purchased by their team members. We are very happy to share our lab resources and help keep their experiments going and make their project come true. ( See also )
