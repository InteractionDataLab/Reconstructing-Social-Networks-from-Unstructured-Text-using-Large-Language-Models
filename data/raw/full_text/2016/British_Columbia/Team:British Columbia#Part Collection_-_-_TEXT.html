Our Parts Collection: BBa_K2139000 to BBa_K21390XX
This year, our parts collection consisted of biobricks designed to deconstruct biomass, specifically lignin and cellulose, down into its components of aromatic monomers and glucose. The decomposition of lignin is required for the other enzymes to gain better access to the cellulose network. With that in mind, the production of glucose is the integral first step for the conversion of raw biomass into useful precursors for use in pharmaceutical production, biofuel production, and a wide variety of other applications. We hope these parts are useful for other teams.
