Favorite Composite Part: BBa_k2139005
BBa_K2139005 is the expression cassette of the basic part BBa_K2139003 that was used to do the surface expression experiments in C. crescentus. Although we were un-able to functionally characterize it during our project due to time constraints (characterized as fusion protein see data here), it has been well documented in literature which can be found below.
The construct was designed to contain the Ptac promotor, ribosome binding site, coding region, and double terminator. This was to allow for the constitutive expression of the enzyme. The catalytic function of the enzyme is to convert cellulose to cellobiose (below).
