Favorite Composite Part: BBa_k2139005
BBa_K2139005 is the expression cassette of the basic part BBa_K2139002 that was used to do the surface expression experiments in C. crescentus. We were able to functionally characterize it during our project and you can see the data here , it has been well documented in literature which can be found below. It originates from the microorganism Paenibacillus sp. MTCC 5639 and the part has been codon optimized for expression in C. crescentus. As such, it contains a high GC content and shows significant difficulty in being amplified by PCR.
The construct was designed to contain the Ptac promotor, ribosome binding site, coding region, and double terminator. This was to allow for the constitutive expression of the enzyme. The catalytic function of the enzyme is to convert cellulose to cellobiose (below).
