This year, we have collaborated with Virginia, EPFL, UC_Davies and Imperial_College iGEM teams!
First, we completed the biocontainment survey created by the Virginia iGEM 2016 team. They collected information about awareness of biocontainment within iGEM teams. Click on the badge below to get more information about the results! Second, we participated in the iGEM.today project, designed by the EPFL iGEM 2016 team as a part of their Human Practices. This platform presents iGEM teams and their projects through “news articles”, what makes it a great opportunity to learn more about other iGEM projects in fun and interactive ways. We were interviewed about our team, "Crescentium," our project, and our experience with iGEM. We also participated in the iGemMatch.org project, created by the UC_Davies team. This project is designed to easily find collaborators from the iGEM community relevant to your project or areas of expertise.
