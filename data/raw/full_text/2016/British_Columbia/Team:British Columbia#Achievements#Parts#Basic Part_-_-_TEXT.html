Favorite Basic Part: BBa_k2139003
BBa_K2139003 is comprised of the coding region of E1. E1 was used as a fusion protein within the middle of Caulobacter cresentusâ€™s RSA-A surface layer protein. We were able to show expression on the surface of C. crescentus and functionally characterize that it maintained functionality. You can see our data here. The part originated from AcidoThermus cellulolyticus and was codon optimized for expression in C. crescentus. Our biobrick contains only the catalytic domain of the full protein.
