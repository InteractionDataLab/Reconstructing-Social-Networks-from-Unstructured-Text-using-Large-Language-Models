Protocols
Find the documentation of our research here.
Protein Engineering
We wanted to engineer Cry3Aa to become toxic to Varroa destructor.
In Vitro Assay
To provide an alternative for tests on live Varroa mites, we designed an assay that uses brush border membrane vesicles.
Varroa isolates
We tried to find our own Varroa entomopathogen.
Riboswitches
To detect the presence of Varroa mites in the beehive, we made a B12 and a guanine riboswitch.
Population Dynamics
A quorum sensing system was characterized to regulate toxin production in BeeT.
Optogenetic Kill Switch
The light-induced kill switch was one of our biocontainment methods.
Chitinases
As a back-up, we wanted to use chitinases which are more harmful to Varroa destructor than honeybees.
Cas9-based Kill Switch
The Cas9-based kill switch was one of our biocontainment methods.
Toxin Scanner
We made a software tool for finding new Cry proteins toxic to Varroa destructor.
E. coli survival
Following the results of the Metabolic Model, we needed more data.
Toggle Switch
We designed a toggle switch that could coordinate mites sensing, BT's toxin production and light sensing with fast responsiveness.
Human Outreach
We implemented our outreach into our research as much as we could. Find the details here!
BEEHAVE
We adapted the BEEHAVE model to include BeeT.
Population Model
Modelling of the population dynamics regulation system..
Kill Switch Model
The optogenetic kill switch was modeled with ODEs to understand the system in more detail.
Metabolic Modelling
We wanted to use a metabolic model to see the effect of our BeeT distribution method.
