Composite parts
Our best composite part: BBa_K1913011
BBa_K1913011 contains a vitamin b12 riboswitch with an inverter and reporter gene (mRFP). This Biobrick allows for inducible mRFP production based on the concentration of vitamin b12. Riboswitches are pieces of mRNA that can regulate gene expression depending on if it is bound to a ligand. They consists of two parts. An aptamer that binds a specific ligand, and an expression platform. This dual system makes riboswitches interesting tools for utilization within synthetic biology: aptamers and expression platform of different riboswitch sequences could potentially be combined to create new riboswitches. The riboswitch used for this biobrick is the btuB of Escherichia coli which normally stops expression after it binds to vitamin b12. Thanks to the TetR QPI system, expression of mRFP will start after binding to the ligand.
In our project, the vitamin b12 riboswitch is used to detect Varroa mites in beehives. The mites feed on the bees’ hemolymph, of which vitamin b12 is a component. BeeT can thus sense whether bees have been bitten, and respond by producing an anti-Varroa toxin.
