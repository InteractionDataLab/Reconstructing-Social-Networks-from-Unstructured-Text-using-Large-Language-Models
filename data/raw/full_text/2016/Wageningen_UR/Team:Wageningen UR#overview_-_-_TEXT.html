Abstract
The abundance and diversity of our food relies on honeybee pollination. Varroa destructor mites weaken bee colonies through the spread of disease. Our team aims to save bees by killing Varroa using bacteria inside beehives. In continuous conversation with beekeepers and scientists we develop a bacterium that targets mites, leaving bees and humans unaffected. The hive-localized bacteria sense Varroa and produce mite-specific toxin, eliminating the need for beekeepers to dose the product. The bacteria are dependent on a synthetic amino acid and are shut down by light to confine them to the hive. Additionally, we develop an in vitro test of Varroa toxicity to show the utility of our bacterium. The system is modeled in various ways to assess its viability in the real world. This is the first effective method to combine specificity, ease of use, safety through bio-containment, and the iGEM open source character to save the honeybee.
