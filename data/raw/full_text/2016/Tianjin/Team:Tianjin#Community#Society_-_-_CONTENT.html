Since the first kind of plastic was found in 1907, we have lived with plastic for over a century. However, the white pollution caused by discarded plastic has raised more and more concern. Though governments in many places have passed law to restrict the use of plastic, the best solution toward this problem is to find out a easy, cheap and environmental friendly way to degrade the discarded plastic. Among the existing degrading way, the biodegradation of plastic is regarded as the most promising one. This questionnaire aims to investigate the daily use of plastic products and the attitude of people toward the biodegradation of plastic.

When it comes to the attitude toward the disposable plastic products, 73.9% of people think they can be allowed to use but should be strictly controlled and recycled. 23.2% of people are totally against the use of them. Only 2.9% of people are totally for the use of them.
Most (85.2%) of people use only 0-1 plastic bottle every day. Only 13.6% of people use 2-3 plastic bottles every day. People using 4 and more plastic bottles every day account for only 1.2%. The using of plastic bags every day is of few differences, the daily number of the plastic bags used is 0-1 for 55.6% of people, 2-3 for 38.7% of people and 4 and more for 5.7% of people.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12 about-left wow fadeInLeft animated" data-wow-delay=".5s"><P class="data" style="color:#344525;font-size:18px">When asked the way of disposing the used plastic products (one can select more than one choices), 74.5% of people selected “I will continue use it if I can”, 33.0% of people selected “I will throw it into the garbage can directly”, 1.2% of people selected “I will throw it everywhere”.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12 about-left wow fadeInLeft animated" data-wow-delay=".5s"><P class="data" style="color:#344525;font-size:18px">When asked whether the plastic products are able to be recycled, we are satisfied to find that 76.2% of people selected the correct choice, which is “some can while others cannot”.</P><P class="data" style="color:#344525;font-size:18px">when investigated the situation of the received education about the effects of plastics to the environment, 46.4% of people only received it in textbooks, 36.3% of people received it in both textbooks and the propaganda of the community, 17.3% of people never received this kind of education at all.</P><P class="data" style="color:#344525;font-size:18px">When asked the proper ways to control the White Pollution efficiently (one can select more than one choices), most people think that using environmental friendly substitutes is reasonable, which account for 81.9%, followed by the people who think that searching for a effective way to degrade plastics by scientists is a good idea, which account for 72.9%.

They look forward to a better way to control the ‘white pollution’. Besides, in terms of technology of ‘white pollution’ control, most people have knew something about biological plastics degradation and think highly of it. They hope that scientists will do further research. From the survey we also notice the public consciousness of ‘white pollution’ and how urgent and necessary we should fix this problem. At the same time, it reinforces our confidence and enthusiasm to solve it using biological method. We will definitely make great efforts to explore and figure out something meaningful to live up to public expectation.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>http://www.17sucai.com/preview/279505/2015-02-06/%E6%BB%91%E5%8A%A8%E8%BF%9E%E6%92%AD%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%87/js/jssor.js
