  19 amplification at 65.0°C with 19.rev/fwd primes.
        PCR worked, positive control worked, no amplification of 19.
  15 amplification at 65.0°C with 15.rev/fwd primes.
        PCR worked, positive control worked, no amplification of 15.
A product length of 900 bp was expected. The gel shows that most plasmids seem to be correct.

Ligation product was transformed into E.coli via heat shock.
  Sep.3th
A colony PCR was performed with twelve colonies.
Gel electrophoresis showed that 2 colonies were positive for connecting the plasmid and gene fragment.
These two colonies were used to inoculate overnight cultures.

  Sep.7th
Plasmids were isolated using a miniprep kit.
Amplification of 13 with Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase out of E.coli
13 amplification at 65.0°C with 13.rev/fwd primes
  PCR worked, positive control worked, no amplification of 13
The fragments of 13 were purified with PCR Purification Kit.
  Sep.8th
13 gene fragment was phosphorylated.
  Sep.9th
Insertion of Ni promoter and ligation of 13-19-15
Ni inducible promoter was ligated into pCPC-3301 vector.
Phosphorylated 13 was ligated into pT-19-15 and transformed into E.coli via heat shock.
Single colonies were obtained by plating.
  Sep.10th
A colony PCR of Ni inducible promoter(pCPC-3301-Ni) was performed with 12 colonies.
  Two of the successful ones were used to inoculate overnight cultures.
A colony PCR of pT-13-19-15 was performed with 7 colonies.
  Two of the successful ones were used to inoculate overnight cultures.
