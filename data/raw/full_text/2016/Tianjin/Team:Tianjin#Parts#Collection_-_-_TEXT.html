Parts Collection
Introduction
This collection consists of all the parts made from the site-directed mutation in the protein modification of PETase. They share the same module and have the same function. The only tiny difference among them is the sequence as well as the enzyme activity of their expression products. All the genes have been codon optimized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
