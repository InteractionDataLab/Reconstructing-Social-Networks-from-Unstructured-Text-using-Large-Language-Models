Overview On Human Practice
This year, we aimed to degrade PET, which is a kind of pollution source, with our modified enzymes PETase and MHETase. We believe that in the near future, it will be applied to tackle with the problem of white pollution. Meanwhile, the masses’ awareness of environmental protection should also be aroused. As a researcher, we are bound to popularize the knowledge of white pollution and synthetic biology. In addition, we discussed with many experts in respect of PET degradation research. They were all helpful and enthusiastic with suggestions on how we could improve our system. We conducted human practice in nine different aspects--Education, Industry, Society, Government, NGO, Law, Competition, Media, Businessplan.
