Lipid Producer</B></H3><P style="font-size:18px">Photosynthetic microorganisms, including eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria, are being optimized to overproduce numerous biofuel. According to previous data, algae accumulate large quantities of lipid as storage materials, but they do this when under stress and growing slowly. By contrast, cyanobacteria accumulate lipids in thylakoid membranes, which are associated with high levels of photosynthesis and a rapid growth rate. Thus, photo-synthetic bacteria have a natural advantage for producing lipids at a high rate. Furthermore, being prokaryotes can be improved by genetic manipulations much more readily than can eukaryotic algae. (Espaux L et al. 2015) Therefore, we decided to do something to make cyanobacteria ,the lipid producer, more appropriate for our project.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12"><P style="font-size:18px"><I>Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942</I> has larger capacity of lipid production than <I>Synechocystis sp. PCC6803</I> but accumulates most of the product in the cell because of the imbalance of the rates of lipid production and secretion. Initially, we intended to do something to increase lipid secretion by knocking the <I>wzt</I> gene(Akihiro Kato et al. 2016), however, <I>Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942</I> wasn’t able to revive in two-week shaking cultivation. So we turned into <I>Synechocystis sp.PCC 6803</I>.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-5"><H3><B class="LipidRecoveryFromBiomass">2.Lipid Recovery From Biomass</B></H3><P style="font-size:18px">The first goal of our research was to facilitate lipid recovery from biomass. The scientific community widespread disrupts the cyanobacterial cell envelope to achieve the goal. (Seog JL et al. 1998)However, all these methods are not economical for large amounts of biomass or add additional cost and reduce the overall utility of the process. Our target is simply to make the cyanobacteria lyse at the appropriate time. 
We found that the cyanobacterial cell envelope is composed of 4 layers: the external surface layers ;the outer membrane; the polypeptidoglycan which is considerably thick, and the cytoplasmic membrane.( Hoiczyk E et al. 2000)To break up the peptidoglycan layer, we applied the holin-endolysin lysis strategy used by bacteriophages to exit bacterial cells(Wang IN et al. 2000). Endolysins are peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes that attack the covalent linkages of the peptidoglycans that maintain the integrity of the cell wall. In addition to endolysins, some auxiliary lysis factors are involved in cleaving the oligopeptide linkages between the peptidoglycan and the outer membrane lipoprotein. Holins are small membrane proteins that produce nonspecific lesions (holes) in the</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-7"><P style="font-size:15px">                            Fig.2.

In this way, the cell wall is easy to break up.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12"><H3><B id="ControlTheLysisSystem">3. Control The Lysis System</B></H3><P style="font-size:18px">To control the appropriate time, a nickel sensing/responding signal system(Garcia-Dominguez M et al. 2000) was used to control the timing of the expression of phage lysis genes in Synechocystis 6803. 
Our strategy for achieving our target is to construct a expression vector pCPC3031-Ni-13-19-15  introduced the Salmonella phage P22 lysis cassette (<I>13-19-15</I>) with a Ampicillin  selection marker  downstream of the promoter Pni, a nickel responding signal operon. Synechocystis 6803 with the pCPC3031-Ni-13-19-15 will lyse after Ni2+ addition.
