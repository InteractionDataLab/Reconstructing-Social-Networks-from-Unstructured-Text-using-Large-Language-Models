This year, our university takes part in iGEM( International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition).This year, we conducted an environmental project about biodegrading plastics by microbial organism. So, we’d like to inquire about environmental issues, please: How much plastic waste do we produce per day here in Tianjin? And what methods do we use to dispose the plastic waste generally? What measures will the government take to deal with the plastic pollution problems, now or in the future?
