Based on the assumptions  above and the description of PET degradation process in a heterogeneous system, we first establish the equation of measuring how much percent the PET degrades and how much the degrading rate is. Then we use the simple but mature Logistic Equation to describe the process of cell growth, and Leudeking-Piret Equation which is a correlation between cell growth rate and product producing rate, to describe the kinetic process of PETase production. Then we use the general method of describing mass transfer process to establish mass transfer rate equation when enzymes diffuse from the cell surface to liquid phase body then from liquid phase body to the PET surface, and the distribution equation of enzyme concentration, respectively. From those equations we can get the total mass transfer rate equation of the enzymes in a heterogeneous system. We analyze and then make a conclusion that the mass transfer diffusion mainly leads to the delay of enzyme concentration change on the PET surface .Finally, taking that MHET, the product of PET degradation, will show competitive inhibition effect into consideration, based on the adsorption equilibrium of PETase on the PET surface, we use the steady state approximation theory and deduce the total kinetic equation of PETase degrading PET. Solve this differential equation we obtain the degradation rate curve of PET under heterogeneous system.

The role of PETase plays in the degradation is to catalyze the cleavage of ester bonds between TPA and EG. This cleavage will directly lead to the decomposition of whole polymer chain and finally the instability of plastics. Thus we choose the ester bond number as an index to evaluate this degradation process.

Since the classical dynamics equation for enzymatic reaction, Michaelis-Menten equation, is based on homogeneous enzyme- substrate system,  it’s not suitable to describe the process of the degradation of polymers. Enzymes will act with polymers through their bonding sites and combine with the substrate after their secretion and diffusion to the PET surface from cells. Both of the molecular configurations change after the adsorption. The enzymatic active center will expose to ‘find’ the corresponding sites on the polymer.

So it supposes the polymer to get flexibility to increase the possibility to react with PETase. However, the rigidity of PET leads to reducing of the activity of PETase. So this step is the restrict step of the whole enzymatic process.

That can be reasonable because absorption is just related to the concentration of enzyme on the PET surface. And enzymes secreted by cells can only get to plastic surface  through liquid transmission in secretion controlling stage.</P><H2><B>Conclusion and Prospect</B></H2><P style="margin-bottom:50px">
We begin to build our models above from the process analysis of PET degradation in heterogeneous system. We construct models for each step and finally deduce the rate curve of  PET degradation by the enzymes secreted by bacteria in heterogeneous system.From this curve we can see that the degradation can be devided into 3 parts.In the first part, degradation rate is under the control of bacteria growth and enzyme secretion.In the second part, it is controlled by the mass transfer of enzyme in the liquid phase.In the third part, it is controlled by the catalytic ability of enzymes adsorbed on the PET surface .From the trend of the curve we can conclude that, in order to degrade PET with a higher rate or make the rate peak as soon as possible,what we first need to do is to promote the growth of bacteria.This will enhance the enzyme concentration.On the other hand, we can accelerate the diffusion of enzymes in the liquid phase.For example,shake cultivation or stirred culture,can eliminate the influence of time delay and make the degradation rate reach the peak fast.Our system assumes that PET degradation only takes place on the surface of PET.Although it's reasonable,as the degradation proceeds, small gaps will form on the plastics due to degradation.If they become so large that enzymes can diffuse into the interior of PET,degradation process will be accelerated to a huge extent.The next step of building models is to take the process and threshold value of internal diffusion into consideration.This will provide a more accurate model to describe the process of PET degradation in the heterogeneous system.
