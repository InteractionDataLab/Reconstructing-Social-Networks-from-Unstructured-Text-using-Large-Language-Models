This part can sense the CpxR protein, which will form spontaneously in <I>E.coli</I> when inclusion body and misfolding protein present in the periplasm of <I>E.coli</I>, and then start expressing RFP so that we can detect red fluorescence. As we all know, the inclusion body will inevitably form when we overexpress heterologous protein like PETase in <I>E.coli</I>. Therefore, the emission of red fluorescence can report the overexpression of PETase. What is more, this device can be modified to report overexpression of any heterologous protein only if the PETase gene is replaced by another heterologous gene. After the red fluorescence is detected, we could start the purification of protein.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><DIV align="center"><FIGURE id="CellLysisBasedRegulationSystem"><FIGCATION>Fig.2.

The ddpX gene can hydrolyze the D-Ala-D-Ala structure in peptidoglycan molecule and cause damage to the cell wall of <I>E.coli</I>. Under normal condition, this gene only express when the cell is in starvation mode in order to use hydrolysate alanine as carbon source. However, if we overexpress this gene, the cell wall will be dissolved and finally cell lysis will happen. Therefore, in this system, when the PETase is overexpressed, the spontaneously forming inclusion body will induce the expression of ddpX and cause cell lysis. It will provide us with a novel and convenient and way of protein purification when you use <I>E.coli</I> as chassis.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-7"><DIV align="center"><FIGURE><FIGCATION>Fig.3.

Luckily we find these three gene that have something to do with TPA degrading in <I>Rhodococcus jostii RHA1</I> can be induced significantly by TPA. The reason why these promoter can be induced by TPA is they have a leader sequence before the promoter sequence, we name it TPA inducible leader sequence (TILS). The gene of TPA transporting protein and regulation protein are also transformed into <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I>. The TPA regulation protein is belong to the IclR family. This novel protein can combine the TILS and induce the expression of downstream gene when it combine the TPA molecule. Therefore, we insert the TILS before the enhanced promoter PGK1 so that we can make our promoter inducible by TPA.</P></DIV></DIV><H2><B>Theoretical Background</B></H2><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><H3><B>1.

The Cpx system is a three-component regulatory system which is kind of similar to the lactose operon.</P><P style="font-size:18px">The Cpx system consists of the histidine kinase CpxA, the response regulator CpxR and the periplasmic CpxP protein. CpxA is composed of a large periplasmic domain and a highly conserved cytosolic catalytic domain. Both domains are connected via two trans-membrane helices. CpxA has autophosphorylation, phosphor-transfer and phosphatase activities .Sensing envelope perturbation by an unknown feature, CpxA transmits a signal via a phosphorelay to CpxR, which in response acts as a transcription regulator of genes, whose products are mainly involved in envelope protein folding, detoxification and biofilm formation. The Cpx stress response is controlled by feedback inhibition CpxP acts at the initiation point of signal transduction by reducing CpxA auto-phosphorylation activity in the reconstituted CpxRA system.</P><P style="font-size:18px">The Cpx pathway is activated by a large number of different signals including elevated pH, increasing osmolarity, metals, altered membrane composition, overproduction of outer membrane lipoproteins and misfolded variants of maltose binding protein.</P><P style="font-size:18px" id="DdpXcelllysiseffect">When the stress is at lower level, the CpxP protein combine with the CpxA to prevent CpxA from phosphorylating CpxR and when the stress changes at higher level, some signals lead to activation of the Cpx pathway. Particularly, misfolded protein such as MalE219 interacts directly with the periplasmic domain of CpxA, resulting in stimulation of CpxA phosphotransfer activity towards CpxR. </P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6"><DIV align="center"><FIGURE><FIGCATION>Fig.5.

In fact, this gene also has many benefits to bacterial. In gram-positive bacterial, Vancomycin, a kind of antibiotics, can cause cell lysis because it can combine the D-Ala-D-Ala residue of peptidoglycan in cell wall and block the cross-linking of peptidoglycan. Some gram-positive bacterial like Enterococcus faecalis and Streptomyces toyocaensis have developed the resistance to the vancomycin because they have VanX gene, the homologue of ddpX gene, which can hydrolyze the D-Ala-D-Ala and transfer the D-Ala-D-Ala residue of peptidoglycan to D-Ala-D-Lac residue so that the vancomycin cannot combine the peptidoglycan.</P><P style="font-size:18px" id="TPAPositiveFeedbackMechanism">However, in gram-negative bacterial like <I>E.coli</I>, which own the robust outer membrane that can resist the vancomycin, the hydrolase ddpX with the same effects also exists. This is strange because the gram-negative bacterial have no necessity to own this kind of seemly dangerous hydrolase. Actually the ddpX in <I>E.coli</I> has another vital use when they are under starvation conditions. The ddpX can hydrolyze the D-Ala-D-Ala in their cell wall to produce the D-Ala as the carbon source to maintain their life. This mechanism is only carried out when they are under starvation conditions. If the ddpX gene is overexpressed, the cell wall will be damaged and cell lysis will occur. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12"><H3><B>3.

We find the similar mechanism in the <I>Rhodococcus jostii RHA1</I>, which can make use of TPA as carbon source. We speculate that there must be the pathway we want in the <I>Rhodococcus jostii RHA1</I>. By the way, RHA1 is also well used in microbial consortia part of our project. In<I> Rhodococcus</I>, the distinct expression patterns of the TPA gene clusters indicate that they are independently regulated. The cluster contains gene encoding putative regulatory protein, namely tpaR. This gene encodes the regulatory protein of the IclR family, based on the presence of a conserved signature region. The regulator has helix-turn-helix domain and encodes regulator for its respective operons, which is consistent with the case for IclR-type regulatory proteins for other aromatic catabolism pathways. IclR-type positive regulators bind a sequence before their promoter DNA in the existence of inductor and start the transcription of downstream gene, so we need to express the regulator too.<A class="btn popover-info ref-title-link" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Reference" data-content="Molina-Henares, A.

Therefore, when the exogenous gene overexpress in the E.coli, the CpxR induced mRFP gene also express and lead to the emission of red fluorescence. The little red fluorescence in the bacterial without transformed into the PETase gene is largely likely to be caused by the basic expression of CpxR protein in the E.coli.
