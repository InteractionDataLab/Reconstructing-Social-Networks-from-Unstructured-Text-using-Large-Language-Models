No. Though I’m not acquainted with him, I can ask my schoolmate in the School of Environment about him for you.

Oh, yes. We’d really appreciate your help! By the way, do you have interflow with Zhejiang University at the moment?

I took part in its summer courses personally, and the courses have ended.

Ding: But I do think that you should upload the common genes in the synthetic biology researching process like genes of fluorescent protein, different kinds of enzymes and so on. 
Chen: OK, because we are not major in biology, so we did not think about this when we did the text analysis.

On the very beginning of the meeting, each team leader gave a brief introduction on their projects. And team Tianjin's project attracted great interests in the environment problem of PET-degradation. After each team's presentation, we started to share our new ideas and problems we crossed with during the experiment, which was a very helpful and encouraging session where we help each other fix the experimental problems.
In a nutshell, this short trip to Beijing is a win-win collaboration.

CCiC(Central China iGEM Consortium) is a national iGEM seminar held by Chinese universities, aiming to promote the communication of Chinese iGEM teams and publicize the conception of synthesis biology.
On the morning of September 2, 2016, we took a flight to Guangzhou from Tianjin. One hour later, we arrived at SYSU. Upon our registration, we exchanged ideas with some teams. At 7 pm, the opening ceremony began and each team made a brief introduction. In the following two days, we simulated the process of iGEM Giant Jamboree, presenting team projects and posters.
At 5 pm of September 4,2016, the seminar was coming to a close. We took a photo together as a reminder. After dinner, we attended the closing ceremony. Afterwards, we went back to Tianjin and got occupied with our experiment again.
We are so grateful to SYSU for invitation and treatment. During the seminar, we have made a lot of friends and had an understanding of other teams’ projects. In the meanwhile, we also got a number of beneficial suggestions. </P><P>P.S.<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2016/a/a2/2016_SYSU-CCiC_%E6%89%8B%E5%86%8C.pdf">SYSU-CCiC Handbook</A>  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
