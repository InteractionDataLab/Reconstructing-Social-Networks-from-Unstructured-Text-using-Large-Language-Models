OUR DEBATE COMPETITION IS
As the tenth anniversary of Tianjin University participating in International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition, our team,  IGEM Tianjin, together with Beiyang Environment-Protecting Association held a debate competition discussing ethical issues provoked by the application of synthetic biology, aiming to publicize the conception of synthetic biology and arouse attention to biotechnology and protecting the globe. With our joint efforts, the debate was successfully held.
The debate began at 20 p.m., 28th,Sep,2016, lasted for an hour. The debate topic is whether it is safe to curb environmental pollution with artificial modified bacterium. Our team members were invited as special guests to watch this interesting competition. During the interval, we gave out iGEM handbooks and souvenirs to audience. After that, we made a brief introduction of synthetic biology and our project.
The game went on very well. By the end of the debate, the winning team and the best debater were selected by the jury. In the interview after this debate, the competitors asserted the topic of todayâ€™s discussion was both sparkling and instructive, which is involved in many professional knowledge. They read a large number of papers. They had learned a great deal of knowledge about synthetic biology and expanded their horizons during the preparation of the debate. Students watching the game also believed it was marvelous. They had got great interest in the application of synthetic biology on resolving environmental issues after listening to many special cases.
Conclusively speaking, this debate was very successful. And we were so delighted to collaborate with Beiyang Environment-Protecting Association.
