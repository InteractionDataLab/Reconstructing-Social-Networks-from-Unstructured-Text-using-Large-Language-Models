Great Biology Pharmaceutical CO.LTD
Fermentation Cylinder
We visited Great Biology Pharmaceutical CO.LTD on August 30th in Beichen District, Tianjin. The company focuses mainly on the production of animal medicine. There were many fermentation cylinders in the workshop. Staff in the company introduced the functions and operation methods of the tanks to us and rendered us realize the difference between textbook knowledge and practical production. Then, the manager, who is also our upperclassman, told us much  experience about the sophisticated society, which made us know the temporary conditions of the biochemistry domain. It was really a nice trip!
