Notes For CFPS system
Week1(8/24/2016-8/30/2016)
Ⅰ.Constraction of expression plasmid in CFPS(cell-free protein synthesis)
The mutants of PETase gene had been contracted by over-lap PCR and Restriction Enzyme cutting sites(SacⅠ&EcoRⅠ) had been added to it’s ends (5’&3’) separately.
Transformation of E.coli (Trans-T1 Phage Resistant Chemically Competent Cell) with pRset_CFP-1(with AmpR) and plating on solid LB culture medium with Amp.
Cultivation the E.coli cells transformed yesterday in several 5mL liquid LB culture mediums with Amp at 37℃ for 12 hours.
Plasmid isolation of pRset_CFP-1.
Primers were designed for the target (CFP gene) within the plasmid pRset_CFP-1.
PCR with Q5-Polymerase to amplify CFP gene out of plasmid pRset_CFP-1 and add Restriction Enzyme cutting sites(XbaⅠ&SacⅠ) to it’s ends(5’&3’) separately.
Bands as expected(about 760bp) in agarose gel , gel purification of  the PCR products.

Week2(8/31/2016-9/6/2016)
XbaⅠ&SacⅠdouble restriction endonuclease digestion in CFP gene.
XbaⅠ&EcoRⅠdouble restriction endonuclease digestion in pRset_CFP-1
Bands as expected(760bp&3000bp) in agarose gel , gel purification of  the digested products(3000bp).
Ligaion of digested pRset_CFP-1, digested CFP gene and digested PETase(M154L) gene in accordance with the 1:5:5 molecular ratio. The newly constructed plasmid is called pRset_CFP-1-M154L.
Transformation of E.coli (Trans-T1 Phage Resistant Chemically Competent Cell) with pRset_CFP-1-M154L(with AmpR) and plating on solid LB culture medium with Amp.
Verification : Colony PCR with fast taq Polymerase, primers: PETase-S/PETase -A, template: Colony of  E.coli  with plasmid pRset_CFP-1-M154L. Bands as expected(about 760bp) in agarose gel.
Cultivation the E.coli cells transformed yesterday in several 5mL liquid LB culture mediums with Amp at 37℃ for 12 hours.
Plasmid isolation of pRset_CFP-1-M154L.
Show More
Week3(9/7/2016-9/13/2016)
Our strategy is to exchange the site-directed mutant PETase-M154L for the other 21 mutants and 1 wild type, separately.
XbaⅠ&EcoRⅠdouble restriction endonuclease digestion in pRset_CFP-1-M154L
No expected bands(3600bp&750bp) in agarose gel. We don’t find the reason why the plasmid constuced can’t be cut into the two expected bands, so we decided to change the initial strategy.
Ligaion of digested pRset_CFP-1, digested CFP gene and the rest 22 digested gene interested (including  21 PETase site-directed mutants geneand 1 wild type ) separately in accordance with the 1:5:5 molecular ratio. The newly constructed plasmid is called pRset_CFP-1-R90I (R90T, R90A, S92A, Q119A, M154A, W159H, W159M, N205L, N205V, S207T, S207A, I208V, S238F, S238V,A240P, S242I.)

Ⅱ. Expression of the plasmids constracted before
We choosed 4 tubes of plasmid to express in the cell-free system firstly.
The protocol of the cell-free protein synthesis system(50 µL) we used :
MQ H2O     7.9µL
Feeding buffer    25µL
Mg2+ solution    1.1µL
Gene( plasmid as template)  1µL
Lysate     15µL
(PS: The details of the system are not available.)
Systems were expressed in 96-well plates and put the 96-well plates into the ELIASA (microplate reader) at 30℃ for 12 hours.
Parallel experiments for expression in CFPS system
The figures above show that the plasmids can express in the CFPS system, although the results of the parallel experimennts indicate that the CFPS system is unstable.

Week5(9/21/2016-9/27/2016)
Ⅲ.Detection of Enzyme Activity
Substrate: 1mM pNPA  Acetonitrile solution.
10 times diluted Enzyme solution(unpurified) mixed with the equal volume substrate.
This attempt of detection failed because our enzyme precipitated in acetonitrile.
Subsrtrate: 1mM pNPA Tris-HCl buffer.
10 times diluted Enzyme solution(unpurified) mixed with the equal volume substrate.
This attempt of detection failed, too. Because we found that Tris can react with pNPA , and pNPA would be transfered to pNP, too.
Show More
Week6(9/28/2016-10/2/2016)
Substrate:0.2mM pNPA water solution.
10 times diluted Enzyme solution(unpurified) mixed with the equal volume substrate.
After static reaction at 39℃ for 8 hours, we detected the characteristic adsorption peak of the product ,pNP, which has no other characteristic adsorption peak except in 400nm.
The control group in the image above indicate that something else in the CFPS system can cause characteristic adsorption peak except in 400nm with the sunstrate.
Substrate:PET.
PET was been put into 20 times diluted Enzyme solution(unpurified).
After static reaction at 39℃ for 5 days, we detected the characteristic adsorption peak of the product ,MHET, which has no other characteristic adsorption peak except in 260nm. Besides, we also deteected the product by Multispectral Scanning.
