Part
We have constructed totally 30 parts this year including 25 basic parts and 5 composite parts . Among them the part BBa_K2110008 and BBa_K2110105 are our favorite parts. These parts include the PETase gene mutants made by rational design, the reporting and regulation system devices, and parts related to the microbial consortium. We also set a parts collection consists of all the mutants of PETase gene and the PETase module. All the parts are submitted to the iGEM Registry via the kind help of GenScript Corporation with all other teams from China.
Future Work
We have made a plenty of achievements this year by our dedicated work. However, biodegradation of plastic is a really big and complicated project, so we cannot achieve all of our anticipated results in such a short time. What we have done can act as reference for the later teams and people. In the future, we can extend this project by many ways such as accurately measure the 3D structure of the enzyme molecule, introduce the Cynobacterial into the microbial consortium, and improve the reporting and regulation way and effect.

Achievement
From the establishing of our team, all the 21 team members from different majors studied and worked together to fight with all the difficulties of our project. Many of us even did not own any knowledge about synthetic biology before joining us. We do believe that nothing is impossible. After over half a year, we have achieved not only the brand new knowledge and various skills such as experiment, modelling, editting wiki, searching for papers, but also something invisible but still pretty valuable like the friendship, the meaning of hard work, the communication skills, and the soul of science-- being rational and integrated.  You can click here to see what we have achieved according to the rewarding criterion, but what we have achieved may be much more than it.
