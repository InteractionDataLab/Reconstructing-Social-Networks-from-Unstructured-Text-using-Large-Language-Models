Hi! After doing the bachelor Life Science & Technology and being board member of the study association for one year I'm currently doing the master Life Science & Technology. I'm the science manager of this year's team. For me iGEM is a nice practical application of my master and also a good way to learn more about other subjects like policy & practice, fundraising and design.
Stefan Marsden
After my Bachelor in Chemistry at the University of Basel (CH), I was looking for a new challenge which I found in the Life Science & Technology Master and the iGEM competition. Biotechnology is a powerful tool to drive innovation towards greater sustainability in the chemical industry. My role is the scientific specification of our construct and hardware requirements for it to be put into practice. During my free time I fence saber on national level and I recently participated as a dancer in a theater production.

Hey! I enrolled into iGEM because I saw it as a really challenging project, especially with respect to my background. I finished Automation and Computer Science at UT Cluj-Napoca (Romania) and am currently doing a Management of Technology Master's at TU Delft. Within iGEM, I am responsible of the Wiki and help with Policy and Practice efforts. I like to play football, video games and meet people from all over the world.
Samantha Basalo Vazquez
After completing my Bachelor in Chemical Engineering, I switched to the Master Life Science and Technology as I became intrigued by the eco-friendly production of useful products made by bacteria. With a prior background in chemical modeling, the position of modeling manager was the best fit for me! Besides my studies, I enjoy painting, swimming and travelling.
Hector Sanguesa Ferrer
I am an enthusiastic student from Morella, Spain, who is working hard for the Master program in Life Sciences and Technology. After some years studying my Bachelor’s degree in Barcelona, I moved to Delft looking for new experiences in biotechnology. Here I had the great opportunity to join the iGem team, where I am responsible of safety issues and lab management. In my free time, I enjoy doing sport and reading;  I could say I enjoy playing football as much as I enjoy science.
Michelle Post
Ciao, I am an ambitious, motivated and open-minded student with interest in both the biotechnology and science communication. Being the policy and practice manager gave me the excellent opportunity to explore both sides; a perfect combination between science and communication. Besides iGEM I really enjoy singing in my jazz band ‘The Bowties’, cooking delicious dinners for my friends and drinking wine or Belgian beers.
Liana Uilecan
Hi! I am Liana, a Computer Science Engineer from Romania. I am currently doing my Master in Management of Technology. I joined iGEM because of its multidisciplinarity long term project. I am the team leader and part of the wiki and policy and practice teams. Along iGEM I enjoy travelling and cooking (eating :) ) delicious Italian and Japanese food.
Marit van der Does
Hi. I'm a third year bachelor Nanobiology student . The reason I joined iGEM was to get more practical experience. I learn a lot during my study programme, but I also wanted to learn how to use that knowledge. I am the Public Relations Manger of the team, but I also help a lot with the modelling and the lab work.
Anne Rodenburg
I'm a fourth year student, studying biological and medical laboratory studies. I joined the team to gain more practical experience, and insight in different subjects. Together with the entire team, I believe that we'll be able to set up a great project. I am the Fundraising and Budget Manager of the team.
