Synthetic biology aims at using biological part to construct different kinds of devices to realize different functions in real world. Experiments in the laboratory is idealized so it cannot represent the real world conditions all the time. In order to simulate the real world condition without taking the biological materials outside the lab, we can use PET products bought from the regular shop instead of the chemical shop. Considering the organisms are living with each other in real world, we applied the microbial consortium to simulate the real world condition as much as possible.
</P><H3><B>Using the Real World Substrate</B></H3><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><P style="font-size:18px">

Our project this year is about biodegradation of the widely used palstic PET. As a polymer, PET is hard to degrade and the degrading process is time-consuming. Due to the mild condition of the biodegradation reaction and the restriction of growing of organisms, it is even slower although it is more environmental friendly. Therefore, we use the substitute pNPA (p-nitrophenyl acetate), a kind of small molecular ester as the reagent of enzymatic reaction. However, pNPA is not what we really want to degrade, so we need to measure the PET degrading effects of our enzyme. Actually, pNPA is mainly used to screen for the mutated PETase gene because of the high requirement of efficiency of this step. When we obtain the mutants we want, we used them to degrade PET. In order to simulate the real world condition as much as possible, we used the PET film bought from the online plastic products shop instead of the test reagent bought from the chemical company. The film is originally used as packing material. We soak the cut film into the 75% ethanol solution and wash them with double distilled water before degrading experiments.

</P></DIV></DIV><H3><B>SEM image of degraded PET</B></H3><P style="font-size:18px">
The main characteration method of degradation of PET applied by us is measuring the absorption peak of product MHET or TPA. However, we think it will be much more intuitive if we can directly observe the degrading results. We used the scanning electron microscope (SEM) to directly observe the surface of PET film after dealt with PETase. We took pictures under different magnifications and the results are as follows.

From these images, we can easily find that after cultured with Bacillus subtilis trasformed with PETase for only 7 days, the PET film showed clearly holes on its surface. What is more, with the extension of cultured time, the holes become more clear, as showed in the figure 3 and 6. These images undoubtedly verify that the PET film is degraded by the PETase synthetized by Bacillus subtilis.

</P><H3><B id="Usingthe">Using the Real World Simulated Microbial Consortium</B></H3><P style="font-size:18px">
The inspiration of the idea of microbial consortium comes from nature. Actually, bacteria never exist alone in our nature, they co-work and cooperate together to achieve an aim or live better in a special condition. Thinking from this point, we established a special bacteria consortium for this enzyme catalysis reaction in order to not only improve the degradation effect, but also simulate the real world condition. In this system ,we applied three kinds of organisms, <I>Pseudomonas putida KT2440</I>, <I>Rhodococcus jostii RHA1</I> and<I> Bacillus stubtilis 168</I> (or <I>Bacillus stubtilis DB 104</I>), to degrade the PET and the harmful product EG and TPA to carbon dioxide or generate biodegradable plastic PHA. The culture medium of this consortium contains significantly less carbon source than common culture medium, which has a clearly similarity with the nature environment. We also decided to introduce the Cyanobacterial into the system in the future in order to make this system use only solar energy to work.
</P><DIV class="row"><H2 id="proteinengineering"><B>Results of Protein Engineering</B></H2><P style="font-size:18px" id="Detailedresults">By expressing our twenty-two PETase mutants and doing the assay in our high-throughput strategy—Cell-free protein synthesis, we successfully screened out a mutant with two-fold PET degradation activity compared to wild-type PETase. </P><P style="font-size:18px">We attempted to use two substrate for our mutant assay, one is PET film and the other is  p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA). pNP-aliphatic esters is a kind of universal assay substrate of PET degradation activity for its rapid reaction and visible color of hydrolysis product. However, as pNPA is soluble, the using of pNPA may not allow us to select out the more efficient mutant improved by being designed to enhance the surface hydrophobicity. Most notably, according to Yoshida et.al, the assay result of activity comparison between PETase, LC cutinase(LCC), and F.solani cutinase(FsC) shows that the activity for pNP-aliphatic esters of PETase is lower than that of LCC and FsC, however, the activity of PETase against PET film is 5.5 and 88 times as high as that of LCC and FsC[1]. Hence aiming at breaking PET plastic and solving real-condition problem, we finally decided to use PET film as our substrate and detect the hydrolysis product mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET) at an absorption of 260nm. Due to lacking of MHET standard (which is not a commercial agent), we failed to draw calibration curve of MHET at 260nm. So we compared the activity of mutants and wild-type with unit absorption, which is positively related to concentration of the detecting product. The result data are as follows.

It is apperant that the interaction of catalytic triad with substrate would be inhibited due to the space oppcupied by 208th isoleucine. That's why we decided to substitue 208th isoleucine with another smaller amino acid.
                   
                    
                        Our result shows the rational design actually worked well and the mutant I208V shows a relatively improved hyfrolysis activity comparing to wild-type. Though as we can see in Fig.3, the substitution of isoleucine with valine is actually a very small change with a methyl on the 208<SUP>th</SUP> amino residue. However it leads to a two-fold improvement of enzyme activity, revealing that as we expected the 208<SUP>th</SUP> is a crucial site and the space adjacent to active center matters a lot.

2. <I>E.coli </I> wildtype added IPTG.
3. <I>E.coli </I> with ddpX gene, no induction.
4. <I>E.coli </I> with ddpX gene, IPTG added as induction.
Then we continuously measure the OD<SUB>600</SUB> of the culture medium by 96-well Microplate Reader and draw the OD<SUB>600</SUB>-culturing time curve by Matlab. The graph is showed below.

</FIGCATION></FIGURE></DIV></DIV></DIV><P style="font-size:18px" id="Resultsofinclusionbodybased"> 
From this image, we can see that in the first 5 hours, the OD<SUB>600</SUB> of each group is almost the same because of the rich nutrition and the ddpX cannot take effect immidiately. However, after 5 hours, the group with ddpX transformed and IPTG induced showed the fastest decrease among all the groups. This is because of the cell lysis effect of ddpX. Comparing the group with ddpX gene and IPTG inducted with the group with wildtype bacterial and the same amount of IPTG added we can draw the conclusion that the ddpX gene can cause cell lysis significantly. However, the data of another two groups are a little strange. We think it is because of the basic expression of ddpX can partly hydrolyze the peptidoglycan in the cell wall and provide cells with D-Ala as carbon source. This is exactly the physical use the the ddpX gene when the cell is under starvation condition, <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Tianjin/Experiment/R-R#ddpx" target="_blank">see more details about this explanation in our experiment page</A>. Therefore the group with ddpX gene but no induction can live longer and better when the nutritions are deficient.
</P><H2><B>Summary</B></H2><P style="font-size:18px">

1.We implemented the cell-free protein synthesis system as a rapid high-throughput assay method.
    
2.We designed twenty-two PETase muatnts and successfully screened two mutants of the wild type <I>PETase</I> with higher enzyme activity.

3.We successfully established a special bacteria consortium-<I>Bacillus stubtilis 168</I> or <I>DB104</I>, <I>Rhodococcus jostii RHA1</I> and <I>Pseudomonas putida KT2440</I> for this enzyme catalysis reaction. We use 16s-rDNA to prove the existence of special bacteria consortium.
4.We optimized culture conditions by changing carbon source, nitrogen source and some ions. After checking the growth situations and conditions of the degrading PET, TPA and EG, we explore a suitable culture condition to co-culture our bacteria consortium.

5.We constructed pHP13-P43-PETase/MHETase plasmid for <I>Bacillus stubtilis 168</I> or <I>DB104</I>. The recombinant strain had the ability to degree PET. Also, we found PNPA couldn’t characterize of enzyme hydrolysis rate.

6. In order to increase the <I>Pseudomonas putida KT2440</I>’s intake of EG, we found the main influential genes---AceA and AcoA and successfully established an overexpression vector in <I>Pseudomonas putida KT2440</I>, which makes this bacterium can utilize EG more efficiently.

7.We successfully applied and improved the previous part BBa_K339007 designed and constructed by the Group iGEM10_Calgary to construct our inclusion body based reporting system and inclusion body based cell lysis regulation system.  
8.The red fluorescence can even be directly observed by bare eyes when we express the PETase gene in <I>E.coli</I> which was transformed into the CpxR-RFP fragment. 
9.We measured the cell lysis effect of the novel ddpX gene and combined it with the PETase expression system in <I>E.coli</I>.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="sideNavbar" style="{border-color: #03a9f4}"><DIV id="jquery-accordion-menu" class="jquery-accordion-menu blue "><UL id="list"><LI><A class="topLink" href="#Overview">Overview </A></LI><LI><A href="#SystemWorkingUnderReal">Under Real World</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#UsingtheRealWorld">Substrate</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#Usingthe">Microbial Consortium </A></LI></UL><LI><A class="topLink" href="#proteinengineering">Protein Engineering</A></LI><LI><A href="#microbialconsortium">Microbial Consortium</A></LI><LI><A href="#OptimizationofCultureConditions">Optimization of Culture Conditions</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#Explorationforanappropriatemedium">Appropriate medium</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#Adjustmentofnitrogensource">nitrogen source</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#Temperature">Temperature</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#InfluenceofCl">Influence of Cl</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#Adjustmentofcarbonsource">carbon source</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#Optimummedium">Optimum medium</A></LI><LI><A href="#xctezhi">The 16s-rDNA Method</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#TheSpecificityofPrimers">Specificity of Primers</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#ThePossibilityofConsortium">Possibility of consortium</A></LI><LI><A href="#ModificationofB.s">Modification of B.s</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#thedegreeofPETdegradation">PET degradation</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#thedegreeofPNPAdegradation">PNPA degradation</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#ModificationofP.p">Modification of P.p</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#AControllableLipidProducer">Controllable Lipid Producer</A></LI><LI><A href="#rrsystem">R-R system</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#Resultsofinclusionbody">reporting system.</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#Resultsofinclusionbodybased">regulation system</A></LI><LI><A class="topLink" href="#Summary3">Summary</A></LI></DIV><DIV class="sideNavCtrl"><DIV class="btn btn-info btn-raised sideNavShowBtn" id="sideNavShowBtn">Hide Navigation</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
