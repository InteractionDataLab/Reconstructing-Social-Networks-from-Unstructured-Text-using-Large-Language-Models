What We Did In This Summer
In this summer, we aimed at degrading PET biologically with two kinds of newly-found enzymes PETase and MHETase.
We modified the enzyme PETase to improve its activity and used R-R (Reporting and Regulation) system to make the expression visible and regular.
We used microbial consortia to continue degrading the products TPA and EG to carbon dioxide.
We also introduced Cyanobacteria to the microbial consortia so that the system can work with only optical energy and carbon dioxide. We also use CFPS(cell-free protein synthesis) system to assay the enzyme activity.
In the Human Practice part, we spread out our project and the glamour of synthetic biology and receive financial help from some corporations.
