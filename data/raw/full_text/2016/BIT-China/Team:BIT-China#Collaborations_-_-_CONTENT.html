                                This year, team Jilin_China aimed to propose a new way to cure the solid tumor by expressing the TAT-Apoptin. The chassis they chose is Bifidobacteria, which can target the anaerobic region of the solid tumors since the microorganism is also anaerobic.

                                CIEI-BJ is a high school team and it’s their first time to participate in iGEM competition this year. In the middle of July, team CIEI-BJ came to visit Beijing Institute of Technology and communicated with our team BIT-China.

                                As an undergraduate team, we shared the core concept of our project this year and explained a little bit about how we have exchanged ideas among the team members and how to assess the feasibility of our design as a reference for high school students.
                            </DIV><DIV class="block-paragraph">
                                Later, team members in high school also shared their fascinating ideas. However, some plans are not that practical due to the objective reasons. A lot of questioned were raised by members of BIT-China to help shape the project of team CIEI-BJ this year. The considerations refer to the practical meaning and the possibility of conduct for an appropriate project. What’s more, some suggestions are given to optimize the details like designing an experiment to prove a concept.
                            </DIV><DIV class="block-paragraph">
                                After the discussion, we showed high school students around our lab and explained the brief function of some experimental instruments. Besides, we introduced them to the previous projects of our team with the aid of posters preserved.

                                After they designed the basic gene circuit, we gave some advice on how to improve it. In the next few months, the guidance of BIT-China to CIEI-BJ are not only limited to the project itself, but also extended to the details about the competition procedures. We have been in touch with CIEI-BJ through the Internet and give advice on many aspects, like how to present our iGEM program to potential sponsors and how to achieve the requirements for deliverables.

                                In September 17th, 2016, some members of BIT-China are invited to share their experience on how to design the wiki page. A few examples were given to explain the good elements in introducing the project in a simple way. What should be put on the wiki were also discussed during this meeting. Considering the web fluency and in order to design a clear page, notes are listed for high school members to pay attention when they are working on their wiki.
