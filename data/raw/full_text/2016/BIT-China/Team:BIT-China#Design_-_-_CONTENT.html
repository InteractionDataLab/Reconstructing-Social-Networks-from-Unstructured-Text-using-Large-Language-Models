                                Equip the bacteria with a plasmid-sensing logically adjustable cell killer (P-SLACKiller), and we need to select a signal which can indicate the intracellular plasmid numbers. Here we give a definition, when the bacteria containing few plasmids consume lots of nutrition but donâ€™t work efficiently, we called them slackers. There is a basic rule: when the plasmid numbers are above a threshold, we regard the bacterium as normally-working and the P-SLACKiller won't start; however, when the plasmid numbers are below the threshold, we judge it as a slacker and the P-SLACKiller will kill these slackers, so that we can achieve the goal of increasing the plasmid maintenance. In the end, in order to kill the slackers and thus control the plasmid numbers, we selected the inhibitor protein as the signal molecular and the in-promoter repressed by inhibitor as a switch to start the killer gene.

So the inhibitor can be used as a signal indicating the plasmid numbers. The inhibitor can repress the in-promoter and control the expression of downstream killer gene. When the inhibitor concentration reduces to a threshold, the downstream killer gene will express. To avoid the unexpected leak out of killer gene caused by the constitutive promoter, we designed the gene circuit with the constitutive promoter and the in-promoter transcribing along different directions like Fig.1.

                                Under normal circumstance, the plasmid numbers are above the threshold, the inhibitor concentration is high enough to completely repress the activity of in-promoter. Considering the effect of plasmids segregational instability, the concentration of plasmids in some cells will decline with time going on. With no intervention, these cells will gradually become slackers as well as the predominant strain among the population. In our project, when the plasmid numbers are below the threshold, the decrease of inhibitor proteins will lead to the increase of in-promoter activity. At this time, the killer gene will express and kill the cell. We define that, when the killer expressed is just able to kill the cell, the plasmid numbers is the threshold we've talked about. Based on this, we concluded that when the plasmid numbers are above the threshold, the bacteria can survive and have high working efficiency. This range is called survival range. To prevent the slackers consume a lot of nutrition, we kill it when the range removes to the dead one.

                            In our project, we tried both the two ways to test the integration efficiency. However, the CRISPR coupled way are deleted from our plan list due to the failure of cas9 and Î»-Red plasmid construction.
