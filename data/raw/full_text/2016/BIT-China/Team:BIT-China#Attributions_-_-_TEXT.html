Acknowledgement
We'd like to appreciate all those who helped us over the summer for making project possible.
a) Modelling support
Jilin_China communicated with us and gave advice on improving our existing model by adding some equations.
See more in Team/collaboration .
b) Human practices support
① Team BIT, Tianjin, Jilin_China, Lanzhou, Peking and CGU_Taiwan participated in our iGEM UNION. [click to see more] .
② Team BIT always communicated with BIT_China about experiments and presentation.
③ BIT_China exchanged suggestions with team Jilin_China in communication meeting.
④ In communication meeting, BIT_China exchanged our ideas with team Peking . All of us got so much help about experiments.
⑤ Team NCKU_Tainan held the iGEM 2016 Asia-Pacific conference and invited us.                                 Through communicating with other teams, we got many great suggestions. [click to see more]
⑥ The technical staff of COFCO offered some great suggestions. [click to see more]
c) Project support
① Team Lanzhou helped us construct a part of our gene circuits to further extend our system. [click to see more]
② UCAS team helped us verified one of our testing circuits again, proving the repeatability of our experiments.
d) Fundraising help and advice
① COFCO provided us with great advice on expanding the application of our project and also gave some financial support for our projects.
② Our school, Beijing Institute of Technology, provided us with financial and technical support.
We also would like to thank all the people who involved in helping make a great iGEM project and give useful feedback.
