Plasmid-Sensing Logically and Adjustably Cell Killer
Monitoring Plasmid Numbers
Kill the Slacker
In the procedure of large-scale industrial
production, due to the random distribution of
plasmids in the process of bacteria proliferation
and division, the bacteria containing less
plasmids will gradually become the
“slackers”.
Generally, we aim to avoid these undesired
bacteria become the dominant population.
There is no efficient way to prevent the birth of
plasmid-free bacteria and the applied ways are
only limited to the laboratory-use.
What about equipping the bacteria with a
plasmid-sensing logically adjustable cell killer
(P-SLACKiller)?
Here is killer’s basic rule:
Kill the slackers (Plasmid numbers are above a
threshold);
Save the workers (Plasmid numbers are below
the threshold).
Surprise! We can guarantee the microbial
population structure stay optimal now!
Our team divide the experiment into 4 parts as below.
Why not click and have a look?
Basic Circuit
We know low-plasmid level cells cost too much but produce less,like a slacker.So let's kill them to improve production.
Inhibitor
Yes,we set a BOMB in every cell,inside the plasmid.They are controlled to Terminate the cell's life.
Killer
Our project depends on good models.Every step we go all with the direction of our model part.
Recombination
Considering the safety requirements,our project is environment-friendly .
P-SLACKiller
· Work or Die
· Monitor Plasmid Numbers
· Kill the Slacker
· Maintain the Better Biosystem
