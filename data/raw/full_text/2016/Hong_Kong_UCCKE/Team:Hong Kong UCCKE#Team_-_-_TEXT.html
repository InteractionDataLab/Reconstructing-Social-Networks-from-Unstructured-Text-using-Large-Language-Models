UCCKE / Team
In this page, you will learn about our school, members of our team and our instructors.
About our team
We are a group of secondary students from United Christian College (Kowloon East) in Hong Kong. Being a relatively new school in the city, UCCKE supports innovative ideas and attempts to try new things.
Our team is formed as an extracurricular activity group, calling the Biology Research Team. Albeit the limited resources we own and proficiency of experience, we aim to study Synthetic Biology through experiments and researches. For the days onwards, We look for more opportunities to interchange knowledge and gain experiences.

More About Hannah Luk
Hannah Luk Student
Bio:
I am Hannah Luk, studying secondary 5 at United Christian College (Kowloon East) in Hong Kong. Being in the school's Biology Research Team for the fourth year, I enjoy doing scientific research very much and believe synthetic biology can make the world a better place. This is my first time participating in such a large science competition overseas. As the student representative of the team UCCKE, I am both enthusiastic and excited. In the competition, I believe I can be enriched by great experience of knowing more about others' projects. Also, I hope to meet new friends from other high schools and universities with similar interests, hobbies and goals. With so many challenges awaiting, I am really looking forward to joining the great iGEM competition this year.

Phoenix Chan Student
Bio:
Here is Phoenix Chan, a student from United Christian College（Kowloon East）. I am so excited about joining the competition since this is the first time for me to experience such a huge international event. Biology has always been my favorite, so it couldn't be any better than having the chance to learn more about it. It did take a lot of effort for me to learn the techniques and theories of synthetic biology, yet I enjoyed the whole process and can't wait to explore more of it. Hopefully after the journey, I would have gain something new other than simply knowledge.

Rosa Lai Student
Bio:
Hi, I am Rosa Lai, a 15 years old form three student. It's the first time for me to join igem but I hope that it will not be the last time. When I was in form one, I started my interest in micro biology as my mum is a micro biology laboratory technician. After joining my team, I started learning different skills and knowledge. Years passed, I am no more a beginner, but a long path is still waiting for me.

More About Hazel Law
Hazel Law Student
Bio:
I am Hazel Law, a form 3 (Grade 9) student. It is my first year joining the Biology Research Team in my school as well as my first attempt to take part in such a huge science competition. Although a year has passed, I still remember the prime reason of joining this team at first. When I knew that the team was going to do experiments with Deoxyribonucleic Acid, I started to be fascinated by it. Despite the deficiency of knowledge I own, I enjoy finding out more about synthetic biology. In the future days, I am willing to be more devoted and learn more from my team, together with teams around the world.
