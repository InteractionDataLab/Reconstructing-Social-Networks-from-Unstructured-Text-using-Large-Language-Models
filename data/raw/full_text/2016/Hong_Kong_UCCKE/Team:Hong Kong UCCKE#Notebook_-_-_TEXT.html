Meeting with Team:HKU
We have met the members from the Hong Kong University iGem team (known as the HKU iGem team), briefly introduce to them our interested area of study and the origin of the idea. By sharing our interested fields, we established a close bond in between. Thanks to the HKU iGem team, we can set our topic with more background knowledges provided.

Finalized project idea
We have finalized the area of investigation during our meeting after 3 weeks of researches and discussion subsequent to our meeting with HKU iGem team. We have eventually decided to investigate on C. elegans, a kind of well-studied roundworm which has a short life cycle and is easy to reproduce.

Preperation for experiment
Meeting in the laboratory, we are briefed by our co-workers on the characteristics of C. elegans before doing and hands on experiment in the morning. Meanwhile we started on preparing for the presentation in the Giant Jamboree. We started having practices on the experiment before the real one.

Experiment, collect data
Laboratory work continues and the presentation preparation goes quite well. We started our real experiment today and a few chemicals were tested. The results are quite surprising as some of the results are completely different from our expectation. Data is being collected and inputted at the same time
