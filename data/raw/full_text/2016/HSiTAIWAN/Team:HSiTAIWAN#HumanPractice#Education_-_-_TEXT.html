Education
We are fully engaged in various educational events and workshops using different communication channels with different groups of people. First, we published two articles sharing our iGEM project and learning experiences in most-circulated science magazines in Taiwan. This allowed us to reach out to those we cannot educate face-to-face. Second, we attended several international and national science workshops. We exchanged ideas about synthetic biology and our bio detecting kit. Third, we conducted media analysis to learn how mass media addressed this issue, and what campaigns we may further initiate to educate the public.
Science Magazine
Science Study Monthly
When first issued in 1962, the aim of this monthly was to help science education to take root, but it has now become an exchange platform for primary and high school teachers, and acts as educational resources for primary and high science curricula. The contents are easy to understand and rich in pictures and words, covering 7 major areas, including physics, chemistry and earth science etc. and providing diverse scientific knowledge to satisfy the public.
Our article “ Born of the “E”vengers will be released in December, 2016.
Our story:
Owing to the food scandal 2014 that happened in Taiwan, 50 students in HSNU decided to invent a bio-sensor that can detect the poison in edible oil.  We chose to use synthesis biology to make our biosensor cheaper. Because we used “E.coli” to be the “avenger” of our food safety, we made ourselves the “Evengers”!
Inventing biosensor
Although E.coli is really cheap on the market, it is difficult for senior high school student to get experiment plasmids and the synthetic equipment. Thanks to IGEM, a synthesis biology contest that is held by MIT, we were able to get the sample DNA to complete our dream of detecting toxin in edible oil.
Biological components design
The most unique feature of IGEM is that it makes gene modularized, standardized, and simplified. The DNA of the plasmid has four restriction sites, EcoRI, Xbal, Pstl, and Spel. When ligasing the fragment DNA into the vector, we only have to use the restriction enzymes to cut the Xbel and Spel restriction site.
Convince to design
By using the IGEM registry of standard biological parts, we can design a new biological device or a biological system to solve problems around us. And the platform served as a great resource for us to stand on the shoulders of giants and complete our ideas easier!
NEWTON- Graphic Science Magazine
Newton-Graphic Science Magazine is the most-circulated science magazine in Taiwan since 1983. It is an international scientific journal that targets at a broad range of readers from teenagers to adults. This magazine explains today’s hottest topics in science.
We are proud of publish our iGEM project on Newton volume 107, Sept, 2016. Through this education approach, in hope, we can reach out those who we have not met in person.

A meetup with students of Kyuyo Senior High School
Kyuyo Senior High School is a public senior high school of Japan. It is located at Okinawa. The mission of this school aimed to educate students in a wide range of advanced scientific subjects, and foster their creativity and a global mindset to develop advanced skills in the fields of science and technology.
When Taiwanese young scientists meet with Japanese young scientists
Missions we aimed:
1.To reach out to students of our same age and promote our project to them.
2.Exchange ideas regarding their science projects
1)Examining the distribution of mangrove forests and the environment across Okinawa.
2)Examining levels of UV light absorption of different plants in Okinawa that result in growth differences.
Conduct an experiment on extracting DNA from the kiwi fruit.
What did we discuss?
Using the think-pair-share strategies, we discussed the ideas of DNA and biotechnology and how these things influence our daily life from both positive and negative aspects. Meanwhile, we promoted our iGEM project to our Japanese friends.
What have we learned?
It is very exciting to learn what students from other country think and learn sciences and technology. Our generation not only needs to learn advanced scientific knowledge, but also requires a global mindset to promote human health and environmental sustainability.
Taipei High School Science Fair
Taipei high school science fair is held annually to facilitate high school students who are in the Science Program and Honor Math Program to exchange their science projects and innovations.
The Science Fair brought a group of young scientists together……
Through the oral presentation and poster session, we found that students from different schools have different ideas for our project. And we also think of their insight to be a valuable opportunity to learn or conceive questions we have not thought of. We seize this chance to learn how to teach people without standard knowledge of synthetic biology, and try to convey the slightest concept of biology rapid scanning.
iGEMer Community
iGEMer- we met, exchanged, shared, and learned from each other.
What have we learned?
Through various breakout sessions and discussion, we learn different projects from individual teams across Asia, ranging from treating contaminated water to diagnosing diabetes. Every team has its own unique way of designing circuits and perceptions to deal with current situations. We also learn a lot of new techniques we have never heard of in our high school times, for example, Crisper Cas9, prions, and tons of diverse RNAs. What we find is the most interesting is the Q and A time, when keen students raise critical questions, some of which we have never thought of. Between presentations, we seize the chance to promote our project to other students, or we cluster around posters asking questions that pop in our minds. What is notable is that a team (NCTU) invented a card game relevant to synthetic biology. We think the game to be amusing and assume it to become a great material in human practice. Also, we get to catch a glimpse of the progress and concoct of other teams through experience workshops. We discuss how we brainstormed our topic, how we recruit members, and what difficulties have we experienced so far. As for round table session, we consulted experts in biology marketing. This experience might come in handy especially if we want to carry out a product to all citizens.
