Framework
This year, in our project, we tried to detect copper, lead, arsenic and aflatoxin in Chinese herb medicine.  Most of these toxins are included in the list that our government has identified as toxic substances in Chinese Medicine to be monitored.   We have submitted four new basic/single parts(BBa_K1961000, BBa_K1961001, BBa_K1961002, BBa_K1961003) and two new composite parts(BBa K1961008, BBa_K1961009) for generation RecF(BBa_K1961001) and RecO(BBa_K1961002), respectively.  These new parts are all for the project of biosensor for aflatoxin.
Among the four parts of function improvement(BBa_K1961004, BBa_K1961005, BBa_K1961006, BBa_K1961007), we designed two new circuits of I721002 for measuring PbrR generation (BBa_K1961004, BBa_K1961005). These two new composite parts, BBa_K1961004 and BBa_K1961005, are for modeling purposes in order to have better measurement of PbrR generation measured by GFP expression.  We designed an auto-regualted PbrR generator(BBa_K1961004) and a general PbrR generator(BBa_K1961005).  We re-ligased or submitted parts that were the previously registered but unsubmitted parts (BBa_K1961006 for BBa_K1613017 and BBa_K1961007 for BBa_1613004).

Basic Part
We have 4 new basic parts for aflatoxin biosensors and we have also submitted one part of function improvement of K1613017(previously unsubmitted part)
For the biosensor of aflatoxin, we submitted four basic parts.  Detection of aflatoxin is involved of two steps: (1) aflatoxin metabolization, which creates single-stranded DNA and activated Rec A; and (2) SOS induction: activated RecA cleaves the LexA repressor on SOS response.
For the aflatoxin metabolism step, we know that among the Cytochrome P450 enzypmes, CYP3A4(K1064004)/CYP3A5 and CYP1A2(K1613004) are major liver enzymes that metabolize aflatoxin.  We reviewed literature and found CYP2A13(BBa_K1961000), which is a Cytochrome P450 in human lung and metabolizes aflatoxin, too.  This new single part can be included in the experiment of aflatoxin biosensor.
For the SOS induction step, we found in literature that RecF (BBa_K1961001), RecO(BBa_K1961002),and RecR(BBa_K1961003) proteins in RecFOR pathway mediate the loading of RecA protein onto ssDNA 1.  RecA polymerizes on single-stranded (ss) DNA and form nucleoprotein filaments.  The filament induces LexA repressors cleavage and result in SOS induction.  Thus, RecF, RecO, and RecR are important “mediator”proteins that determine SOS induction.  Thus, we submitted them as new parts.

Composite Part
We have two new composite parts for the Pb2+ biosensor for Chinese herbal medicine, and a part for function improvement for BBa_K1613017.
1. The Pb2+ biosensor (BBa_K1961006):it is a function improvement for BBa_K1613017  (HSNU-Tapei, 2015 iGEM).  We re-ligased this composite part.  This composite part involves two stages (1) generation of PbrR promoter with a binding site for lead ion, thus forming Pb2+-PbrR dimer and (2) fluorescence expression when Pb2+-PbrR dimer binds onto pbr promoter (Figure 1) or when PbrR binds onto pbr promoter first followed by lead ion binding onto it (Figure 2)
Figure 1 Lead ion detector: dimer binds onto pbr promoter
Figure 2 Lead ion detector: PbrR and lead ion bind onto pbr promoter sequentially
From literature, we understand that the PbrR and Pb2+-PbrR dimer compete to bind onto pbr promoters and result in poor fluorescence performance.   In order to measure the PbrR generation, we designed an autoregulated PbrR generator (BBa_K1961004 ) to control the amount of PbrR and compared its performance with a common PbrR generator (BBa_K1961005 ).
2. Autoregulated PbrR generator(BBa_K1961004): consists of the TetR and PbrR generators, both controlled by PTet, which has TetR binding sites.  TetRs bind onto PTet and repress the gene expression of TetR, PbrR and GFP.  We used tetracycline to induce the gene expression of PbrR and GFP (Figure 3)

3. Common PbrR generator (BBa_K1961005 ): the generation of PbrR is under control of a constitutive promoter (BBa_J23102 ) (Figure 4)

On the other hand, we ligased two new composite parts for the RecF (BBa_K1961001) and RecO(BBa_K1961002) proteins in RecFOR pathway mediate the loading of RecA protein onto ssDNA.

Part Collection
We designed four biosensors to detect Cu2+, As3+, Pb2+, and aflatoxin in the Chinese herb medicine. We have new part collections for Pb2+ and aflatoxin biosensors.
For the biosensor of Pb2+, literature indicates that the PbrR homodimer and Pb2+-PbrR dimer compete for the binding sites on pbr promoters, resulting in poor performance of report gene (GFP).  Thus, we designed an autoregulated -circuit for PbrR generator ( BBa_K1961004 ) to control and measure PbrR.  We compared the autoregulated PbrR generator with another PbrR generator with general promoter ( BBa_K1961005 ).  Our experiment provides helpful information for future design of new part.
For the biosensor of aflatoxin, we identified  CYP2A13 ( BBa_K1961000 ), a cytochrome P450 in human lung that metabolizes aflatoxin.  We also understood that RecF ( BBa_K1961001 ), RecO ( BBa_K1961002 ), and RecR ( BBa_K1961003 ) proteins mediate the loading of RecA protein onto single-stranded DNA, and are important for the SOS induction.  Thus, we submitted them as new parts.
Biosensor of lead ion
To detect lead ions in Chinese medicine herb, we need a lead-specific binding protein (PbrR), a MerR family of proteins, which is involved in Pb2+ resistance.  Like any other MerR family, PbrR proteins are metal-binding and DNA-binding proteins.  In the absence of Pb2+, PbrR binds as a homodimer to the divergenet promoter region of PbrR gene and lead-resistence pbr operon, repressing the transcription of PbrR and genes in pbr operon.(Figure 5).
Figure 5 Lead ion detector: PbrR and lead ion bind onto pbr promoter sequentially
When there exist Pb2+ in cytoplasm, Pb2+ and PbrR form a Pb2+-PbrR dimer which leads to an allosteric underwinding of the pbr promoter DNA thereby shortening the space between RBS and promoter and activate the transcription.(Figure 6) .
Figure 6 Lead ion detector: dimer binds onto pbr promoter
In this sense, both PbrR homodimer and Pb2+-PbrR dimer compete for the binding sites for pbr promoters.  Therefore, we introduced a new part-design for autoregulating the transcription of PbrR using the TetR respressor. We used the GFP expression downstream to measure the PbrR( BBa_K1961004 ) (Figure 7(a)) and compared it with another PbrR generator under control of a constitutive promoter( BBa_K1961005 ) (Figure 7(b))

Biosensor of aflatoxin
Detection of aflatoxin in Chinese herb medicine is involved with two steps: one is aflatoxin metabolism (Figure 8) and the other one is the SOS response (Figure 9).
In the first step, we submitted four basic parts: CYP2A13( BBa_K1961000 ) , RecF( BBa_K1961001 ), RecO( BBa_K1961002 ), and Rec( BBa_K1961003 ).  We also used a composite part CYP1A2 (which was designed by HSNU 2015) to metabolize aflatoxin, creating aflatoxin B1 exo-8,9-epoxide(AFBO).  AFBO caused DNA damage, creating single-stranded DNA.  Single-stranded DNA activates RecA protein, which will make the LexA repressor cleave and proceed the SOS response.  RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins mediate the loading of RecA protein onto ssDNA,functioning as the RecOR or RecFOR complexes;these proteins are often called “mediator” proteins.(Figure 8).
In the second step, we used the part of DNA damage reporter (BBa_K079050,  designed by  IGEM08 Bologna), which has a SOS box  with LexA binding site.(Figure 9).
