Oh hello there,I am Charlie,a trusty member of the "Herb Tasters" and also the brainiest E. coli in the colony.
I know all the secrets of Chinese herbs and their magical healing powers.
If you are up to a challenge,find me at team HSiTW at the jamboree.
I am the one in a straw hat,showing them pearls.I will be waiting.
Muhahahahaha

Circuit Design for Measuring PbrR generation
PbrR protein is one kind of MerR regulator which activates the PpbrR promoter in the presence of lead ion. In our project, we transformed a plasmid with PbrR generator into E. coli to design a biosensor to detect lead ion in Chinese medicine. In order to measure the generation of PbrR, we designed two types of PbrR genetic circuits and measure the PbR according to the GFP expression downstream:
1.Autoregulated PbrR circuit( BBa_K1961004 ): an autoregulated generator of PbrR measured by GFP expression downstream. PbrR and GFP expression is under the control of TetR and promoter PTet (Figure 1(a))
2.Constitutive PbrR circuit( BBa_K1961005 ): a constitutive generator of PbrR measured by GFP expression downstream.  PbrR and GFP expression is under the constitutive promoter (Pcon, BBa_J23102 ) (Figure 1(b))
In order to investigate the response of PbrR in these two circuits, we make use of GFP as a reporter in the downstream as a proxy to measure the PbrR produced by two circuits. For autoregulation PbrR circuit, we want to study in detail about the response of PbrR protein with increasing amount of inducer Tc (or aTc). The advantage of utilizing this autoregulation circuit is to get very precisely for the gradual response with the inducer, which implies that the amount PbrR protein will be the function of inducer. For utilizing the constitutive PbrR, we are able to measure the background expression of PbrR in E. Coli without any inducer. This will help us to compare and recognize the generation of PbrR under autoregulation. All the constructs used here, the Hill coefficient will be calculated to disclose the intrinsic property embedding the both of genetic circuits and be a guide for our biosensor project.
