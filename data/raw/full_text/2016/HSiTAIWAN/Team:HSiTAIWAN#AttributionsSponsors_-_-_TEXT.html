Oh hello there,I am Charlie,a trusty member of the "Herb Tasters" and also the brainiest E. coli in the colony.
I know all the secrets of Chinese herbs and their magical healing powers.
If you are up to a challenge,find me at team HSiTW at the jamboree.
I am the one in a straw hat,showing them pearls.I will be waiting.
Muhahahahaha

To accomplish this project, we are proud to say that our team work together:
* initiate the idea of biosensors for detecting toxins in Chinese herb medicine
* explore the issues of toxins in Chinese herb medicine
* identify the goal of our project
* layout the project framwork and plan
* complete experiments, human practice, wiki, film and all work.
But this project wouldn’t be complete without the help of many dedicated people. Everyone in the team is in charge of different tasks such as the synthetic biology part, the experiments, the wiki, the product design, the short film etc. We were fortunate enough to have advisors, experts and senior undergraduate students who participated in the making of this project. We especially appreciated the collaboration with NYMU-Taipei on the media analysis of our human practice (refer to their web on https://2016.igem.org/Team:NYMU-Taipei/Collaborations ). We can’t thank them enough for helping us with the idea discussions, guiding us through the experiments, and providing us with necessary advice at crucial times. Thank you!
Collaboration
1. Collaboration on Media Analysis of gene technology related information  with NYMU-Taipei
Motivation with passion: Our team believe that media is the most efficient way to promote the knowledge and popularity of gene technology /synthetic biology(GTSB), not through sporadically independent advocate or educational activities .  Thus, we are curious and concerned about what gene technology related information in the media that the Taiwanese people are exposed to and whether the Taiwanese people can understand the information.  Thus, we told the NYMU-Taipei team about our idea to consult them.  NYMU-Taipei revealed their passion to iGEM and ambitiously suggested that we should do something for iGEM to support its influence on synthetic biology worldwide.
Goal: Thus, we decided to work together to conduct a large-scaled media analysis on the gene technology related information to make it as a significant project for GTSB.  In this way, using social study methods, we can provide solid and essential academic evidences that can be used in future design, plan, and implement science education in GTSB.  Thus, our goal is to investigate the media context on gene technology related information, and identify issues of the context.
Work on media analysis project: We analyzed the sufficiency and readability of media context on gene technology related information from magazines, newspapers and iGEM wiki.  We worked on defining the goal and scope of this project together.  NYMU-Taipei was in charge of establishing conceptual framework of our media analysis, designing survey sheets (codebook) based on the framework, and retrieving iGEM wiki; HSiTAIWAN is in charge of designing survey sheets(codebook), accomplishing data collection.  We analyze the data together and the results can be retrieved from the section of the Human Practice section on two teams.
2. Academic conference, meetings, lab work
We are fortunate to have opportunities to work with two iGEM teams of NTHU_Taiwan and NYMU-Taipei. We worked together for discussing problems we faced and together figured out solutions for improving the protein performance in experiments.  In addition to attending the 4th iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference 2016 Taiwan, we have many chances to discuss our iGEM project with these two universities.   Particularly, NYMU-Taipei team gave us lectures that we need to proceed our project, and also technical supports when we had problems
Professional Support
We received full professional supports from the best universities in Taiwan.  Professors and graduate students also fully sponsored and supported our experiments in their laboratories.
Technical Support
To accomplish this project, students of high school indeed need tremendous technical supports including wiki, film, field experience, and so on.  All experts that we interviewed in our human practice also spent a lot of time in discussing the experiment and science related to our project.  We appreciated their kind technical supports to our project.
Practical Support
We received a lot of help and advice from universities, industry, NGO and government departments. They gave us not only advice but also linkage to other resources that we needed for our project.   With their important help, we can improve the quality of our project and make our project closer to the social need.
