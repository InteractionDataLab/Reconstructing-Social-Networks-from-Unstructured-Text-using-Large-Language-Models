Objecive:
To test the influence of scutellariaon E.coli growth rate.
Material:
DH5α pcDNA (ctrl)on SOCagar plates
SOC broth
Amp
15 ml tube、50 ml tube
96 well plate
pipettor
Procedure:
Day 1
1.Culture 4 tubes of DH5α(with pcDNA)in 15ml centrifuge tubeovernight: 2ml SOC with 2ulAMP
2.Blendscutellariaonstock(concentration 10mg/ml)
Day 2
1.Preparesix15ml centrifugaltube, each containing 1ml of SOCand 2ul AMP
2.Put the six tubes into a 37°C water bath for five minutes.
3.After five minutes, take out the six tubes and add 1ml ofthe overnight culturedbacteria liquidinto the six tubes.
4.Culture them for another two hoursin a 37°C shakerto make sure if they cangrownormally.
5.Prepare five kinds of concentration of scutellariaon, 10μg/ml, 3μg/ml, 1μg/ml, 0.3μg/ml, 0.1μg/mlby serial dilution.
6.Prepare eighteen 50ml tubes, each contains 29.1ml of SOC,and 0.3ml schutellariaon solution(with five kinds of solution).
7.Put the eighteen 50ml tubes into the 37°C water bath for five minutes
8.Add 0.6mlbacteria liquidfrom the six tubes
9.Examine the OD of each tube every 30 minutes
Results:
From this result, we can see that the growthratesof the control and different concentration are very simular.  Therefore, we know that that scutellariaonwon’t influence the growth rate of E.coli.
