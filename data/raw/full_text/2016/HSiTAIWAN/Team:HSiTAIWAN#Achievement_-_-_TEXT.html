Achievements
Bronze Medal
1.Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree
We registered for iGEM, had a great summer, and we’re going to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
2.Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page (section 3).
We met all deliverables on the Requirements page (section 3).
3.Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
We’ve created an attribution page that clearly illustrates our work and distinguishes our work by others. We also detailed the contributions by each. (see our Attributions )
4.Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
We documented 8 new standard Biobrick Parts and submitted them to the iGEM Registry. (see our Parts )
Silver Medal
1.Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #4. Submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
We documented 8 new standard Biobrick Parts and submitted them to the iGEM Registry. (see our Parts )
2.Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synthetic biology problem.
We did media analysis with NYMU-Taipei together and we work with NTHU_Taipei and NYMU-Taipei to discuss problems and find out solutions. (see our Collaboration )
3.iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
We visited and had a lot of discuss with several government agencies, including the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Food and Drug Administration.We know that our project has great potential and really does benefit the detection of toxins in our daily life. We held a lot of interviews with related agencies and companies and did some analysis to learn more professional knowledge and know how the public thinks about our project.
Gold Medal
1.Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
We successfully integrated Human Practice into our Herb Tasters project by well organizing social studies, public engagements and education. Chinese medicine (CM): 1.Analyzed national health interview surveys to investigate the knowledge and use of CM. 2.Visited governmental divisions and Congress legislators to understand issues of CM/toxin regulation and enforcement. 3.Visited and interviews key stakeholders, including NGO, the largest CM manufacturer, a food company, CEO of biotech companies to present our project and obtained advices. We received positive feedbacks from them. Gene Technology/Synthetic Biology (GTSB): we focused on education and promotion. 1.We collaborated with NYMU-Taipei to conduct a large-scaled media analysis on the GTSB context on newspaper, magazines and iGEM wiki. 2.PIs published articles to share our 2015 iGEM experiences on two most-circulated science journals in Taiwan(Science Study Monthly; Newton). 3.We presented our 2015 and 2016 iGEM projects in academic activities/meetings, and have received positive feedbacks. (see our human practice )
2.Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry.
We improved the function of 2 previous existing BioBrick Parts and entered this information in the part’s pages on the Registry. (see our Description )
3.Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept.
We demonstrated function proofs of concept of our project. (see our Project )
4.Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab.
We did a lot of social studies on the regulations and we tested our E.coli in Chinese medicine with toxins, this proved that our E.coli is functional under real-world conditions.(see our human practice )
