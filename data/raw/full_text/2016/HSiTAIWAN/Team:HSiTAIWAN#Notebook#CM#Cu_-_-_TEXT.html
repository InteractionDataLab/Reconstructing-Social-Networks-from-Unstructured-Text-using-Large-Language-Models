Oh hello there,I am Charlie,a trusty member of the "Herb Tasters" and also the brainiest E. coli in the colony.
I know all the secrets of Chinese herbs and their magical healing powers.
If you are up to a challenge,find me at team HSiTW at the jamboree.
I am the one in a straw hat,showing them pearls.I will be waiting.
Muhahahahaha

I can treat people who are yin deficient, and liver problems that cause dizziness,cataract of the eyes,
lower back pain, premature graying of the hair and tinnitus.
Hello! My name is Chuan Xiong. This is how I look like.
Make a guess, which part of me is used as medicine?
(1) the root
(2) the stem
(3) the leaf
(4) the seed
Ans.(1) the root
Name: 川芎 (Chuan Xiong)
Botanical Name: Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort
I help with blood regulation to prevent relevant to blood stasis and non-stop bleeding.I can also strengthen your qi circulation.
In addition, I relieve you of physical pain,          such as headaches, abdominal aches, chest pain, and muscle pain.
Finally, I free the ladies of menstrual disorders and amenorrhea.
What’s up? My name is Dang Gui. I can:
(1) stop coughing
(2) regulate mense
(3) reduce internal heat
Ans.(2) Regulate mense
Name: 當歸 (Dang Gui)
Botanical Name: Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels
I can remove blood stasis and clots, so I am usually used to regulate menses,lubricate intestines to correct constipation, reduce swelling, expel pus.

Topic: Fluorescence, Optical Density Testing in 甘草
Procedure:
Control= k1555000without Chinese Medicine or Cu2+
Control + Cu=k1555000with only [Cu2+] =3ppm
Control + CM=k1555000with only Chinese Medicine
Positive Control=k608010
Negative Control=k1106004
CM+3ppm=k1555000 with Chinese Medicine and [Cu2+] =3ppm
CM+9ppm=k1555000 with Chinese Medicine and [Cu2+] =9ppm
CM+27ppm=k1555000 with Chinese Medicine and [Cu2+] =27ppm
Chinese Medicine concentration level is 3μg/ml
Results:
We want to see whether Chinese Medicine would trigger or stifle the fluorescence expression of our E. coli. As in graph1, we can see that there is no difference in fluorescence intensity when no copper ion is present. The control groups range as low as ournegative control which is  constantly  inhibited.  On  the  other  hand,  in  graph2,  Chinese Medicine does not repress the fluorescent expression, conducting a parallel performance with the control group. Also, this graph indicates that  there  is  significant  difference  with  the  manipulating  factor  of copper ion existence. In graph3, we can still see that the fluorescence intensity of E. coli hikes as the [Cu2+] rises, and reaches a splendid performance  at  27ppm  (the  law  standards  for  Taiwan  is  20ppm). Moreover, this graph shows that Chinese Medicine would not interfere the bacteria’s positive relation with copper concentration levels. In graph4,  we  want  to  point  out  that  at  27ppm  concentration,  the fluorescence intensity of bacteria is nearly as strong as our positive control which constantly gives off green fluorescence protein. In short, we can assure that our bacteria are practical in this Chinese Medicine, and thus, our project is achievable.

Conclusion:
Although we manipulated a few slight changes between data, but we can still acknowledge an abstract of different Chinese Medicine. Aside  fromScutellaria, Bupleurum,  and Ligusticum,  the  other  6 Chinese Medicine appears to be auspicious to the growth curve and fluorescence intensity of the E. coli. With our estimation, we guess that our E. coli can endure a bulk proportion of Chinese Herb; as for the few herbs that may stifle the results, we hope to create a data base for people to easily correspond to different herbs and know our product’s detection limit. Fortunately, we stumbled across a paper claiming that Scutellaria absorbs copper ions by its very own nature. Hence, it will perfectly make sense to the decliningresults offluorescence overtime. To cope with this situation, we decide to add chelating agents into our product to prevent the absorption. Further experiments are expected to examine whether the agent will or will not interfere the bacteria, and the efficiency of different material agents. Lastly, we find that copper ions at the concentration of 27ppm (the law standard in Taiwan is 20 ppm) may suppress the growth and survival of bacteria; yet, the remaining bacteria can express a high level of fluorescence intensity, which means they still great potential even in high toxic concentration levels.
