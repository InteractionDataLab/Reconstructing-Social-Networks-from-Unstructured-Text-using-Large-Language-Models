Most of these toxins are included in the list that our government has identified as toxic substances in Chinese Medicine to be monitored.   We have submitted four new basic/single parts(BBa_K1961000, BBa_K1961001, BBa_K1961002, BBa_K1961003) and two new composite parts(BBa K1961008, BBa_K1961009) for generation RecF(BBa_K1961001) and RecO(BBa_K1961002), respectively.

These two new composite parts, BBa_K1961004 and BBa_K1961005, are for modeling purposes in order to have better measurement of PbrR generation measured by GFP expression.  We designed an auto-regualted PbrR generator(BBa_K1961004) and a general PbrR generator(BBa_K1961005).  We re-ligased or submitted parts that were the previously registered but unsubmitted parts (BBa_K1961006 for BBa_K1613017 and BBa_K1961007 for BBa_1613004). </P><P class="contentP">Diagram 1.

Detection of aflatoxin is involved of two steps: (1) aflatoxin metabolization, which creates single-stranded DNA and activated Rec A; and (2) SOS induction: activated RecA cleaves the LexA repressor on SOS response.  </P><P class="contentP"> For the aflatoxin metabolism step, we know that among the Cytochrome P450 enzypmes, CYP3A4(K1064004)/CYP3A5 and CYP1A2(K1613004) are major liver enzymes that metabolize aflatoxin.  We reviewed literature and found CYP2A13(BBa_K1961000), which is a Cytochrome P450 in human lung and metabolizes aflatoxin, too.  This new single part can be included in the experiment of aflatoxin biosensor.  </P><P class="contentP"> For the SOS induction step, we found in literature that RecF (BBa_K1961001), RecO(BBa_K1961002),and RecR(BBa_K1961003) proteins in RecFOR pathway mediate the loading of RecA protein onto ssDNA <SUP>1</SUP>.  RecA polymerizes on single-stranded (ss) DNA and form nucleoprotein filaments.  The filament induces LexA repressors cleavage and result in SOS induction.  Thus, RecF, RecO, and RecR are important “mediator”proteins that determine SOS induction.  Thus, we submitted them as new parts.</P><TABLE class=""><TBODY><TR><TH>Part</TH><TH>Type</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR><TR class="" id=""><TD><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1961000">BBa_K1961000</A></TD><TD>coding</TD><TD> cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily A member 13 (CYP2A13)</TD></TR><TR class="" id=""><TD><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1961001">BBa_K1961001</A></TD><TD>coding</TD><TD>RecF protein-SOS mediator protein.

In the absence of Pb<SUP>2+</SUP>, PbrR binds as a homodimer to the divergenet promoter region of PbrR gene and lead-resistence pbr operon, repressing the transcription of PbrR and genes in pbr operon.(Figure 5).</P><P class="contentP">Figure 5 Lead ion detector: PbrR and lead ion bind onto pbr promoter sequentially</P><P class="contentP">When there exist Pb<SUP>2+</SUP> in cytoplasm, Pb<SUP>2+</SUP> and PbrR form a Pb<SUP>2+</SUP>-PbrR dimer which leads to an allosteric underwinding of the pbr promoter DNA thereby shortening the space between RBS and promoter and activate the transcription.(Figure 6) .</P><P class="contentP">Figure 6 Lead ion detector: dimer binds onto pbr promoter </P><P class="contentP">In this sense, both PbrR homodimer and Pb<SUP>2+</SUP>-PbrR dimer compete for the binding sites for pbr promoters.

This part consists of a promoter(<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:J33201">J33201</A>) with ArsR repressor gene encoding the arsR repressor protein, which is sensitive to sodium arsenate or sodium arsenite.  Arsenite or arsenite ion binds to the repressor protein ArsR, resulting in inability to repress the promoter. </P><P class="titleTwo" style="color:#538135;font-size: 18px">Parts we used</P><TABLE class=""><TBODY><TR><TH>Part</TH><TH style="width:100px">Type</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR><TR class="" id=""><TD><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1106004">BBa_K1106004</A></TD><TD>device </TD><TD>Arsenic ion detector
