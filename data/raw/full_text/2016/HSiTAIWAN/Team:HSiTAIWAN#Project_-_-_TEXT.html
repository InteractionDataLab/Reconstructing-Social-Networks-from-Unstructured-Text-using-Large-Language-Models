Oh hello there,I am Charlie,a trusty member of the "Herb Tasters" and also the brainiest E. coli in the colony.
I know all the secrets of Chinese herbs and their magical healing powers.
If you are up to a challenge,find me at team HSiTW at the jamboree.
I am the one in a straw hat,showing them pearls.I will be waiting.
Muhahahahaha

Introduction
The brilliant advances in genetic engineering technologies based on proteins and non-coding small RNAs are enabling the systematic biological functions for both prokaryote and eukaryote. In this study, we utilize the mean field theory and the 4th Runge-Kutta method to mimic the engineering synthetic genetic circuits in Escherichia coli (E. coli), including the small RNA (sRNA) regulations and autoregulation circuits. For sRNA level in E. coli, the near simultaneously regulations that decrease (or increase) the target mRNA disable (enable) the target protein function. Therefore, the phase space for induction-regulation plays a key role and should be thoroughly investigated by simulations. In comparison with the sRNA level, the simulations and experimental methods based on the autoregulation circuit (Ptet-tetR) are designed to quantitatively describe the reporter protein or fluorescence response. The Hill coefficient is also checked to disclose the intrinsic properties of the autoregulation circuits in E. coli.
Regulation
The introduction for genetic circuits
Negative regulation —Protein  (repressor) inhibits transcription (Ex. LacI, TetR protein). Inducer– binds to repressor, alters form, reduces affinity for target, allows expression of gene. Sometimes, small molecule required for repressor activity.
Positive regulation —Activator protein increases transcription rate. Generally bound to a smaller signal molecule. (Ex. XylR protein activates Pu promoter).
sRNA-mediated gene silencing -(sRNA) are small (50-250 nucleotide) non-coding RNA molecules produced by bacteria; they are highly structured and contain several stem-loops. sRNAs can either bind to protein targets, and modify the function of the bound protein, or bind to mRNA targets and regulate gene expression. (Ex. RyhB and sodB)
