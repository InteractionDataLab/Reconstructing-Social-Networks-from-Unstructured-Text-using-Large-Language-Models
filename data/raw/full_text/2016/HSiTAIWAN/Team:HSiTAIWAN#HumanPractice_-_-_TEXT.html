Oh hello there,I am Charlie,a trusty member of the "Herb Tasters" and also the brainiest E. coli in the colony.
I know all the secrets of Chinese herbs and their magical healing powers.
If you are up to a challenge,find me at team HSiTW at the jamboree.
I am the one in a straw hat,showing them pearls.I will be waiting.
Muhahahahaha

Integrated Human Practice
Framework
We have great achievements in bridging the gene technology science and social issues related to Chinese medicine and gene technology and synthetic biology (GTSB) through the integration of our iGEM project, social studies and field experiences.  This table summarizes how we designed and planed our human practice, what we had done, and what we learned and have achieved.  Figure below showed how we integrated the human practice and our Herb Taster project

We analyzed three national health interview surveys to investigate the knowledge and use of CM. We visited government agencies and legislators to understand the CM/toxin regulation, policy design and enforcement. We interviewed the key NGO that advocated the CM/toxin regulation.  We visited and consulted experts of biotech companies and the largest CM manufacturer to receive advices on experiments and product design.
Gene Technology/Synthetic Biology (GTSB)

We focused on education and advocate. We collaborated with NYMU-Taipei to conduct a large-scaled media analysis on the content of GTSB. Our PI published articles to share our 2015 iGEM experiences on the two most-circulated science journals in Taiwan. We presented our 2015 and 2016 iGEM projects in many academic activities and meetings, and have received positive feedbacks from the participants.
Features of Social Study

This year, we used solid social study methods to investigate the issues of Chinese medicine and Gene Technology/Synthetic Biology (GTSB)
1. Social Epidemiology. This series of National Health Interview Surveys were conducted by the government.  We analyzed three-year (YR2005, 2009, and 2013) national health interview surveys to investigate the use of Chinese medicine in Taiwan to understand the current use of Chinese medicine in Taiwan.  We also investigate Taiwanese people’s knowledge on Taiwan regulation on manufacturing Chinese herb medicine and prescription of Chinese herb medicine.  This series of high-quality national surveys provides us correct information on the knowledge and use of Chinese medicine so that we can assess the potential risk of misuse Chinese medicine in our society.
2.Media Analysis. We believe that the most efficient way in advocating the knowledge of synthetic biology is through media.  Thus, we would like to know what and how the media report messages related to GTSB.  We worked with NYMU-Taipei on conducting a large-scale media analysis of GTSB in newspapers, magazines and wiki.  We analyze the sufficiency and readability of the media context in Taiwan’s media.  To our knowledge, our media analysis is the first innovative work that is able to provide organized information on GTSB.  The evidence from our media analysis will be very helpful for future science education in synthetic biology.
Strength of Stakeholders

We reach the most important stakeholders related to the detection of toxin in Chinese herb medicine.  We presented our project to them and received positive feedbacks from them.  Our stakeholders include two types of features
1.Policy and Regulation: we visited NGO, legislators, and two divisions of Ministry of Health and Welfare (Division of Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy; FDA Taiwan).  Visiting these institutions enriches our knowledge and concept about policy development and implementation related to safety of Chinese medicine.
2.Profession in Chinese Medicine: we visited the best Chinese medicine in Taiwan, the best food company, and professors of Chinese medicine at National Yang-Ming University.  These institutions gave us very professional advices on our project of detecting toxins in Chinese Medicine.
