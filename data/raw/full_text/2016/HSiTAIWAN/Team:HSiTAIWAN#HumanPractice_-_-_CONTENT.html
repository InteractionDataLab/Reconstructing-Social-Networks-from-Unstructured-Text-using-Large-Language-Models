We analyzed three-year (YR2005, 2009, and 2013) national health interview surveys to investigate the use of Chinese medicine in Taiwan to understand the current use of Chinese medicine in Taiwan.  We also investigate Taiwanese people’s knowledge on Taiwan regulation on manufacturing Chinese herb medicine and prescription of Chinese herb medicine.

We analyze the sufficiency and readability of the media context in Taiwan’s media.  To our knowledge, our media analysis is the first innovative work that is able to provide organized information on GTSB.
