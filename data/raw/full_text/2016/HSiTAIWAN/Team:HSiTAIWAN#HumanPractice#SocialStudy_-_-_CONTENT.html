Chinese medicine plays an important role in the Asian culture as food and medicine. In this study, we want to investigate the knowledge and use of Chinese medicine in Taiwan and the association with socio-demographic characteristics.  We used three waves of National Health Interview Survey (year 2005, 2009, and 2013) to examine the knowledge and use of Chinese medicine in Taiwan.  Our results showed that Chinese medicine is commonly used in Taiwan.  Poor knowledge regarding regulations on Chinese medicine manufacturing and purchase is associated with lower education.  Our study reveals that Taiwanese people are likely to be exposed to potential risk in taking Chinese medicine. </I></P><P class="contentP"><B> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ </B></P><P class="contentP"> Social epidemiology applies the method of epidemiology to investigate the prevalence of a social issue and its association with potential determinants</P><P class="contentP"><B>1.Motivation:</B> Western medicine has been dominating our society in treating diseases for decades.

Results: </B></P><P class="contentP"> Over eight years, Taiwanese population has an increasing proportion of the elderly.  Population with education of college or above become the majority society segment. </P><P class="contentP">The results in Table 2 show that use of Chinese medicine service is not rare in the Taiwanese society.  Only one third of the Taiwanese people have adequate knowledge regarding the regulation on Chinese medicine manufacturing and prescription.  It is common to see that Taiwanese people purchase Chinese medicine without physician prescriptions. </P><P class="contentP">The results of logistic regression is shown in Table 3.  Compared with year 2005, there were less people using Chinese medicine as main medical measure in year 2009(OR=0.87) and 2013(OR=0.83) (Table 3).  However, there were more likely for the Taiwanese to report visit Chinese medicine outpatient care in the last month in 2009(OR=1.11) and 2013(OR=1.20).  Male and the elderly were less likely to use Chinese medicine than the reference groups.  The likelihood of using Chinese medicine significantly increases with the educational level.  Taiwanese people with education degree of senior high school are more like to buy Chinese medicine without physician’s prescriptions (OR=2.49).  </P><P class="contentP">The results of logistic regression on knowledge are shown in Table 4 .   Knowledge regarding GMP on Chinese medicine is significantly associated with higher educational level.  Similarly, knowing the requirement of doctor’s prescription for Chinese medicine purchase is significantly associated with higher education level.   </P><P class="contentP"><B>6.Conclusion:</B></P><P class="contentP">Taiwanese used Chinese medicine as one of medical measures to cope with illness.  Most of them did not know regulation and policies related to Chinese medicine, particularly less-educated group.  Due to inadequate knowledge , they were under potential health risk of misusing Chinese medicine.    </P><P class="titleTwo" id="1-3">Media Analysis of Gene Technology/Synthetic Biology</P><I>(This media analysis was done in collaboration with NYUM-Taipei, so all information are shared by both teams.)</I><P class="contentP"><B>1.Motivation</B></P><P class="contentP">Learning from the article “The role of social scientists in synthetic biology”  written by Jane Calvert and Paul Martin, we understood that although there is no consensus on the definition of synthetic biology, there is a widespread conviction that it has important ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI), and that these should be explicitly addressed.</P><P class="contentP">Whether gene technology/synthetic biology can be accepted and become prevalent and profound in a society depends on education.  We believe the impact of education can’t be significant through sporadical, independent efforts by individuals.  We know that media plays the most important role in influencing the knowledge, attitude and behavior of the people.  Thus, we believe only through right and efficient media can GTSB be taken into consideration and become helpful technology adapted widely. </P><P class="contentP">iGEM has been the most influential worldwide contest on synthetic biology.  In the competition, students from every countries learn the greatest science part of this  discipline.  Furthermore, they learn more than gene engineering because they were exposed to different issues and problems in our society.

Results: </B></P><P class="contentP">Due to small number of iGEM wiki, our analysis will focus on newspapers and magazines.  Table 1 showed that the distribution of GTSB conent differs between newspaper and magazines.  Magazines have higher proportion of issues related to science, medicine, and technology than news papers (80.0% vs 57.1%).  Another difference between newspaper and magazines is about the geographic area in the report.  Magazines have high percentage of international issues than newspapers (82.0% vs. 41.8%)                      </P><P class="contentP">In terms of sufficiency of science translation in GTSB, newspapers and magazines are quite similar in number of viewpoints in the reports.  Newspapers have slightly more perspectives than magaziens.  However, magazines include more attribution for the perpective and provide more reference than newspapers(Table 1b).                      </P><P class="contentP">In terms of understandability (Table 1c), it is quite obvious that articles in magazines are more likely to be difficult for readers to comprehend than articles in newspapers.  Also, magazines have very higher percentage of including more than 3 technical terms in the articles than newspaper.                      </P><P class="contentP">The logistic regression in Table 2 shows that the sufficiency of science translation media was signficantly related to the issues in terms of number of viewpoints.  Compared to articles related to science issues, economic articles are less likely to include over 1 viewpoint.  In provision of extended references, magazines are more likely to provide extended references.  Provision of extended references were also related to content of science issues. </P><P class="contentP">Table 3 shows that articles in magazines were far more likely to be difficult and having terminology than those in newspapers.  Articles related to social issues were far less likely to be difficult or having more than 1 terminology than the articles related to science report.  Interestingly, articles related to social issues are less likely to belong to “positive attitude” although only few of them are of negative attitude.                        </P><P class="contentP"><B>6.Conclusion:</B></P><P class="contentP">This is an exploratory study exmaining the science translation in GTSB in Taiwanese media.  We found that science reports are the majority in the GTSB media reports, followed by social issues and economics.  Most articles in Taiwanese media possess positive attitude toward GTSB, followed by neutral attitude.  Articles in magazines are quite more difficult to understand than newspapers.  Because magazines mainly reprot science reports on GTSB, we think improving understandability by reducing difficulties of the articles in magazines should be effective in promoting GTSB in Taiwan.   </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
