Topic:Bacteria Culturing
Material:
old agar with E coli
coating bar 2
new agar plate 2
chloramphenicol
curette 2
Procedure:
1.Gather bacteria from old agar plate with curette
2.Put bacteria in shaking incubator for 15 minutes
3.Add more chloramphenicol and bacteria to one of thenew agar plate and add only bacteria to the other plate
4.Spread the bacteria evenly with coating bar
5.But new agar plates in incubator
Results: are expectednext week
The number of reconstructedbacteriawas far less then we had expected. The previous agar plate showed abnormal colonies, and the DNA density results ran out low. We assume the antibiotic wearing off over time, or the cloning vectors unable to successfully be inserted. Therefore, we tried adding more antibiotics to solve the solution.

Results:
Last time, we didn’t find any strips of DNA that matchedour interested DNA. Today, however, several colonies that we cultured last time turn out to be white,which was a possible feature of a successful E. coli. So we run a PCR to test whether the white E. coli has been successfully implanted. The results werenegative. We still don’t have a completed cell. We thought that the binding of the backbone’s two ends might affect the results. Thus, we decided to knock the sticky ends out and try to ligase the plasmid again.

2.Cut DNA at the restriction site of Spe1~Hpa1(approximately 100bp).
3.Measure the concentration of DNA from each tube. Eliminate the sample with a low concentration(17.7ng/μl).
4.Run the remaining DNA samplesin a gel electrophoresis.
5.Searchfor DNA parts at the length of 100bp.
Results:
Our white E. coli colonies could have two possible results. First, the plasmid might have a reversed insert site. In this case, there should be a DNA length about 500bp when we run the infrared sensor. Second, theplasmid has been successfully inserted.If this is the case, we should see a DNA length about 100bp.
Our results came out with no DNA length near 100. However, we found four plasmids showing a sequence of DNA with the same length, which we assume itis the backbone. Three ofthe plasmids show nothing else;while one plasmid shows a DNA with the length around 500bp. The last plasmid is believed to be the one with a wrong insert.Because we did not find the DNA, we hypothesized that the three plasmids have a different DNA sequence than the last one. In other words, we think that the three plasmids convey the correct DNA. Yet, the infrared sensor device did not show any DNA we were looking for. So, we presumed that the enzyme(Hpa1) could be mild, causing poor visibility of the DNA. Next time, we plan to enhance the quantity of the enzyme. Also, we will increase the density of gel so that the DNA could be more concentrated.
The plasmid to the right shows an additional DNA.
The four plasmids on the right show a same DNA part.

3.Run the gel electrophoresis.
Results
Although we have added more enzymes, there is still no sign of DNA around 100bp. The result is similar to that from last time, but with a clearer view of the DNA. Due to the fact that features of the colonies we have chosen accord to a successfully inserted colony.There should be a DNA strain around 100bp, unless, the sequence of our E coli. contradicts logically. We will check whether there is any problem in our sequence before the RFP.

We now face difficulties of getting the correct DNA length. Thus, we ran a primer on two different plasmids, from the RFP site to the Lead Promoter site. After matching the DNA sequence, we couldn’ t find the Lead Promoter site. However,we found the DNA sequence of B0032 at 471~483bp, the sequence of I721002 at 491~889bp and an incomplete part of B0015 at 897~. This result (figure 1)fits perfectly if we consider the whole insert to be reversed. The reason for the missing sequence of the Lead Promoter may be because the primer couldn’t go any further. So, we took a closer look at the three DNA sequences we matched. The B0032 sequence was negative(reversed), but the other two were positive(not reversed). To shorten up, the B0032 has been reversed, and the whole insert has also been reversed in the backbone. Next time, we will reinsert the insert partsand make sure we have the right plasmid (figure 2)through quick PCR.

Results:
Every colony on the agar plateappears to be white, which is what a correctly ligased E. coli should express. To increase the chance of succeedingin finding the correct colonies, we picked 62 colonies for PCR. 9(1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, )out of the 62 tend to have the rightlength of DNA(about 700bp). And to make sure that the sequences are accurate, we chose 2 colonies(1-6, 2-18)which are most valid after infrared  lightscanning. We  will  send  the  samples  in  for  further sequencing.
2016/02/01
After sequencing, we confirmed that the DNA is indeed what we need. To testthe  E.  coli  accessibility, we are  going  to performethree experiments,including howthe  E.coli react  to  Pb  in  different concentrations([Pb]), what factors may alterthe expression of the E. coli, and the survival ratesof E. coli in different living conditions. We makea table that lists four variables(restriction of growth, E. coli amount, time,and[Pb]) to record different results. It was our original plan (Figure1and Table 1).
In order to assure that there are equal amountsof bacteriain the tubes,we cultured the E. coli in a single tube, andthenevenly divided into all tubes. Next, we added5differentconcentrations of Pb into the 5tubes. However, at this point, the professor reminded us to be aware of the Pb ions penetration-time. The different concentration of Pb might affect thebacteria’s absorption speed, thus influence the amount of Pb in the cells. To control these potential biases, he advisedus to observe Pb in different concentrations,  and  control  three  variables  in  terms  of  restriction  of growth, time duration, and amount of E coli. We then changed our plan and performed the new strategies.
First, we prepare 10 tubesthat contain different [Pb]concentration levels, andevenly add the E. coli in each tube(Figure2and Table 2). Then, culture the tubes for one nightto ensure all bacteriahaveabsorbedthe maximum amount of Pb ion. Then, we will observe the remaining E. coli  (some  might  die in  high  concentration  of  Pb)  and  examine  the differencesbetween one another via O.D. Finally, we will choose the most suitable Pb concentration as the goldstandard to conduct the remaining experiments. By completing these processes, we can both figure out the best situation to collect our results and test the survival rate of our E. coli.

OD results
According to the results in the table above, the concentration of Pb between 101to 10-7ppm doesn’t affect the survival of E. colimuch. There isnosignificant finding in this experiment.
Compare to the control tube, the E. coli in the experimental tubes didn’t express any obvious glow(Figure 1 and 2). There were two Victor Shen 2016/2/3possibilities. First, the experiment indeed failed. Second, the E. coli actually did react, but was just too faint for our naked eyes to observe. Surprisingly,  our  bacterium  did  express  a  hazy fluorescent(Figure 3).So, we assumed the process is accessible, but the level ofPb ions might be too low. Much to our shock, we mistook the former [Pb] 102folds higher. Every solution was 102lower than the what we mean to prepare.
Meanwhile, we concerned that LB broth might somehow react with the Pb solution, and then alter the proper functionof the E. coli.  Hence, we  tried  anothermethod  to  test  the results  of bacteriain different [Pb] levels.We first spread our E. coli onto the agar plates to make sure they have the necessary survival requirements.  Next,  we  dripped  small  amounts  of  Pb  solution onto the surface of our E. coli. By doing this, we expect no other materials from  the  broth could interfere the  reaction.

2.Dilute the control bacteria 2 times into 7 tubes. (1, 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6)
3.Add  the  control  and  bacterial  fluid  into  the  wells  of  a photographic plate.
4.Place the plate into the fluorescence spectrometry machine. (excitation 585, emission 610)
Results:
Table 1 shows that the absorption levels and concentration levels increase at a direct proportion.Figure 1 shows that the spectrometer is precise and the relation between the absorption level and the concentration level.As shown in Table 1 and Figure1, we can see that the detecting device is precise and the deviation mean is low. Thus, our calculations can be accounted accurate.
In Table2, any bacteria with Pb solution added shows a higher fluorescence absorption compared to that without any solution amplified. There is a slight difference between the bacteria with Pb solution added and none. But the distribution of the absorption results appears to be random.Hence, we knowthat our E. coli does express a red fluorescence when combined with Pb ions. However, there is no significant relevance between the Pb ion levels and the E. coli’s fluorescence expressions.
In conclusion, our E. coli is capable of detecting the existenceof Pb ions, but is not able to differentiate the changes in the concentration levels of the solutions.

We wanted to examine whether our E. coli has a strong singularity and if the presence of other metal ions may influence the bacteria’s absorption ability. So, we tried out 4 othermetal ions in additional to leadions. Furthermore, we wanted to test the detecting ranges of our E. coli. According to our previous functional tests, we were able to conclude that our bacterial device was capable of detecting Pb ions less than 10-7ppm.

Results:
In this study, we used functional arrays to examine the singularity. We expected to find that E coli only responded to lead ions. But we did not get the results we expected. Table 1 shows the control samples we made. In our experiment, we made two sets of control:one was fresh LB broth and E. coli; another one was J231002 in different solutions at the concentration level of 10-3ppm. Table 2 shows the fluorescence absorption of different metal ions. The results suggest that our E coli were significantly responded to lead ions. However, our E coli were also significantly responded to other metal ions. We suspected that the bacteria havea poor singularity bond between lead ions, so they also react with other metal substances. Accordingly, we decide to expend length in time,allowing sufficient time for the E. coli to interact with lead ions, and distinguish the differences of lead from other metal ions.In the previous experiment, the reaction duration was 24hours. This time, we plan to prolong the reactionduration to 1 week.

After discussion, we suspected that living bacteria might disrupt the  detecting  of  fluorescence  protein. A  fluorescence  spectrometry machine doesn’t only detect the fluorescence level, but it also calculates several other factors. So, we decided to examine the bacteria through a fluorescence microscope, in that way, we could rule out other factors except the fluorescence of the bacteria.
Based on the picturesbelow, they obviously showthat the bacteria consisting of lead expressesa clear glow compared to other experiment samples.Thus, we can conclude that our E. coli dohave a specific characteristic.

Topic: Preparing Toxic Solution
Material:
CuSO4-5H2O*2.0g
105ppm Pb(NO3)2*10ml
Tube*13
ddH2O*118ml
Procedure:
1.Measure 2g of Cu2+crystal and pour it into a tube. Add ddH2O to 10ml.
2.Dilute the solution by 10 times in the sequence of 105 104 103 102 101 1 10-1ppm in concentration.
3.Do the same as for lead solution.
Note:
oday,  our  plan  was  to  culture  E.coli  in  five  different concentrations, ranging from 103to 10-1. Thus, I first diluted the five concentrations.  However,  my  advisor  reminded  me  that  the ion solution would be further diluted when added into the culturing broth. Either  I  prepare  the  exact  same  concentration  in  LB  broth,  or,  I prepare a more concentrated water solution. So, I chose the latter and prepared the solution up to 105ppm. Also, I was advised thatE. coli would stop growing after 14 hours, hence, I would have to collect my sample by then. If the bacteria still remain in the 37°C incubator, eventually the cells would all die out. Another thing I learnt was that the fluorescent proteinwould begin the process of protein degradation. (Protein should be stored at -80°C, in other words, 37°C is not a nice temperature for storing protein). Given these two conditions, I should not culture the E coli today because I have school classestomorrowand I do not have two consecutive days.Therefore, I plan to culture the E. coli over the weekend.

Procedure:
1.Prepare one tube of arsenic solution inthe concentration of 105ppm.
2.Dilute the solution by tenth folds, making another solution in the concentration of 104ppm.
3.Wipe  the laboratory  counter with  adequate alcohol. Then, light an alcohol lamp in the middle of the table to provide a temporary germ-free environment (1 square meter).
4.Burn  the  steel  coating  bar  until  it  turns  bright  red  for sterilization. Wait about 20 seconds for the coating bar to cool off, or else, the high temperature will destroy the germ colonies later on.
5.Using  the  coating  bar,dab  a  colony  from  a  former  plate. Zigzag the germ colony on a new petri dish.
6.Burn the steel coating bar again.
7.Spread the colony on the fresh petri dish further. In that case, the colonies will be more scattered. Thus, it will be easy for us to pick colonies in the future.
8.Place the petri dishes into the incubator to culture.

Eppendorf*20
ddH2O
Dry bath incubator
Procedure:
1.Analyze the medicine into three categories, liquid, thick broth, or solid chunks.
2.Heat the thick broth at the temperature of 100°C for 10 minutes in a dry bath incubator. Wait until the broth liquefies.
3.Dilute  the  fluid  by  1/10  into  individual  Eppendorf. The formula should be: 150μl of Chinese medicine and 1350μl of ddH2O.*Thick broth often clogs up easily. So be sure to be fast.
4.Smash the solid chunks into powder, the dainty the better.
5.Measure 15mg of powder. Add ddH2O in an Eppendorf to 1.5ml. Mix the two thoroughly.
Results:
Some of the medicine stew was too thick that it did not liquefy even after heating for 20 minutes (Figure 1). And some of the medicine chunk was too hard to break down (Figure 2). So, we decided to turn to a herbal medicine professor for advice. Then, we can figure out how to deal with this situation.

Procedure:
1.Add the samples into different Eppendorf.
2.Add ddH2O to the concentration of 10mg/ml.
Future Project:
We plannedto test whether Chinese medicine would suppress the growth of the E. coli. Thus, we have decided to add Chinese medicine into the culturing environment of the bacteria. Essentially, there are three methodsof conducting this experiment. First, spread Chinese medicine across the surface of the agar plates while culturing. Second, mix Chinese medicine into the agar gel. Then, culture the bacteria as usual. Third, culture the bacteria in a culturing tube and add Chinese medicine. We chose the latestmethodfor two considerations. One the one hand, the first two methods requirecounting colonies. Onthe other hand, the last method analyzes the bacteria’s growth via optical densitywhich is more reliable. Using a more objective analyzing system, we can increase the accuracy of our experiment.
Further, we dilutedChinese medicine into 5 different levels of concentration, ranging widely. Because we intend to test the survival rate of the E. coli,the concentrationrange should be broader to save time and resources.

Topic: Analysisof OD, GFP, RFP
Results:
According to the bar charts(Figure 1 & Figure2), we can see that as the same bacterial fluid gets diluted, the optical density drops.Also, from the charts, we can assume that metal ion concentration levels are not relevant to the growth of E. coli. Hence, the instrument for measuring OD is functional and accurate.
In terms of the fluorescence sample, results are not going well. Aside from the sample with thehighest concentration of copper ion (102ppm), all the other testing samples have no significant absorption difference with the negative control sample (Figure 3). What’s worse, the  fluorescence  absorption  in  RFP  (biosensor  for  lead)  appears random(Figure4). Thus, we cannot even find the slightest connection between the concentration of lead ion and the intensity of RFP, whereas the negative control sample shows a stronger fluorescence than the sample with the highest ion concentration. Based on the results, we are guessing that the instrument for detecting fluorescence absorption is not reliable. So, we have to use another device in our next experiment.

Procedure:
(For growth rate pretest)
1.Pick a colony (k1613017) and add it in 20μl of Ampicillin and 20mlof LB.
2.Culture  for  the  first  4  hours  without  testing  optical density(OD). *Because the bacteria haven’t gone into a log phase, the growth appears to be slow. There is no use in testing OD at this time.
3.Test the optical density next every 1 hour.
(For fluorescence preparation)
1.Pick two colonies (k1613017, RFP positive control) and culture them separately in 3ml of LB and 3μl of Ampicillin.
2.Culture the two tubes in an orbiting incubator for 8 hours.
3.Add 490μl LB, 5μl of lead solution, and 3μl of bacterial fluid into a 24well plate and culturing tubes.
4.There should be six different samples in each experiment set. Negative control, positive control (RFP), 101, 10-2, 10-7, 10-8ppm concentration of lead ion.
5.Incubate the two sets (well plate, culturing tube) in a shaking incubator for 16 hours.
(For lead solution preparation)
1.Add 8g of Pb(NO3)2 into 500ml of ddH2O to create a lead ion solution in the concentration of 104ppm.
2.Dilute the solution by 10 folds, from 104to 10-6ppm. *900μl of ddH2O+100μl of previous solution.
Results:
Although the bacteria colony we took contained a large variety of E. coli, we can still take the growth rate as a reference. We wanted to examine the growth phase of our bacteria, that way, we can make sure that our following experimentswill acquire healthy and fresh bacteria, which are in the log phase. In the graph below, after culturing about 7 hours, the bacteria approached 0.6, which is the perfect condition for testing. Thus, we will design our further experiments to be based on bacteria which are cultured for 7 hours or so

Lead ion solution*2*5μl (103, 10-2, 10-5, 10-6ppm)

Ampicillin*7μl
Procedure:
1.Culture the frozen bacteria in different concentrations of lead ion for 8 hours.
2.Prepare the blank set with LBand antibiotic.
3.Test the fluorescence intensity of the sample.
Results:
From the table above, we sought that the fluorescence of bacteria did not correspond to the concentration of lead ion, which is contrary to what we tested before. Thus, we assumed that the frozen bacteria might somehow be contaminated or degraded. But, I guessed that there might be something wrong with the construct of the plasmid, or maybe the test results we did before was simply a coincidence. So, I would try to recheck the sequence that we ran before to check whether the frames have shifted. For now, we decided to re-transform the plasmid into a fresh group of E. coli, and hope to test the function again.

Results:
We ran a gel electrophoresis to check whether we have successfully transformed our interested gene into our bacteria. So, we usedthe plasmid  we  transformed  to  serve  as  a  reference  to  the  extracted plasmid we got. The results are as the followingfigure 1. Although there is a long smear in the original plasmid, while our extracted plasmid seems clean-cut; the numbers of base pair are significantly near and can be assumed to be a successful transformation. However, since the plasmid was used 4 to 5 months ago, we cannot be sure if the plasmid has mutated or shifted frames. Thus, we decide to culture a colony  of  successfully  transformed  bacteria,  and  test  its  function tomorrow. If the results do not run out well, we will then try western blot to see if PbrR protein was ideally transcript. If that doesn’t run well either, we might choose to reconstruct our DNA.

Results:
As in the table below, we can see that the experiment sampledid not differ with the negative control, which has no lead ion in the solution. Also, the sample will E. coli shows less fluorescence than our blank sample, containing only LB. Furthermore, the fluorescence of the bacteria did not grow strong overtime. Thus, we decided to culture a longer time, and if that does not prove to be well, we shall run a western blot to make sure that our bacteria is capable of producing PbrR protein.
