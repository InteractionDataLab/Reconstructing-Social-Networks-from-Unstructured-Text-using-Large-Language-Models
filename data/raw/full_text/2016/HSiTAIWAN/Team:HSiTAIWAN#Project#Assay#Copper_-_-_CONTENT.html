In  order  to  examine  the survival of  the  bacteria,  we  first  measure  the  optical  density  (600nm)  of  the bacterial  fluid  every  half  an  hour.  Then  to  prevent  the  deviation  of initial  bacteria  count,  we  organize  the  results  by  calculating  the doubling  time  of  the  bacteria.  Next,  we  measure  the  fluorescence intensity  of  bacteria  at  an  excitation  wavelength  of  470~485nm  and an emission wavelength of 508~538nm for every half an hour.</P><P class="titleTwo" style="color:#0070c0;font-size: 20px;">Growth Curve</P><P class="titleTwo" style="color:#0070c0;font-size: 20px;">Fluorescence Intensity</P><P class="titleTwo" style="color:#0070c0;font-size: 20px;">Discussion</P><P class="contentP">From  graph  1,  we  can  see  that  the  growth  rate  of  bacteria in concentrations of 3 ppm to 3*10<SUP>-10</SUP> ppm between 3 to 5 hours does not differ. (We have done an initial data processing by taking logarithms during  the  bacteria’s  exponential  phase)  That  is  to  say,  that  the survival  rate,  reproductive  rate  of  our  bacteria  is  not  interfered. However, the growth rate of  our positive control appears to be lower than the other samples. We are guessing it is because the strong green fluorescence   disturbs   the   wave   absorption   at   the   wavelength   of 600nm,  which  is  commonly  used  to  measure  the  optical  density  ofbacteria.  Keep  in  mind  that  for  the  purpose  of  easy  labeling, the “positive control” here is not a genuine control of our testing of optical density,  it  is  the  positive  control  for  fluorescence  intensity  testing 
(k608010).  So,  the  true  positive  control  for  testing  growth  rates should  be the “control”, which  is the sample  that contains  no copper ion in its environment. Also from the same graph, we can see that the bacteria manipulate  every  hour  and  are  especially significant  after  5 hours.</P><P class="contentP"> From graph 2, we can examine that the growth of fluorescence intensity  over  the  past  8  hours.  The  fluorescence  expression  rises rapidly  after  culturing  for  5  hours,  which  matches  perfectly  that  the fluorescence   intensity   does   have   a   positive   correlation   with the amount  of  susceptible  bacteria.  Withal,  we  cannot  be  sure  if it  is  the bacteria  amount  or  the  fluorescence  itself  that  grows  overtime  that causes  the  expression  to  enhance.  We  are  willing  to  do  a further investigation. Since we have analyzed from the optical density testing, we  know  that  the  concentration  of  3 ppm  of  copper  ion  does  not affect  the  growth  rate  of  E.  coli  and  has  the  best  expression.  Yet,  we hope   to   figure   out   the   detection   limit   and   might   increase   the concentration  of copper ions. We are looking forward to find a more suitable, high fluorescent expression, concentration level.</P><P class="contentP" style="font-size: 16px;text-align:center">Graph 1.

First,  we  conducted  our  experiment  with  herbal  extract.  Herbal extract  is  basically  the  production  of  raw  herbs  brewed  together  in the condition  of high temperature and low pressure. The process can eliminate  excess  substances  and  other  microorganisms.  Thus,  it  will be a more suitable experiment subject. This year, we chose 9 types of the   most   common   Chinese   Medicine   extract.   We   measured   the growth  curve,  doubling  time,  fluorescence  intensity  of  the bacteria cultured inside these extract fluid.</P><P class="contentP">We noticed that some of the Chinese Medicine might absorb toxic ions. Hence, we manipulated a chelating agent to ligand the ions. We later ran a few experiments to ensure whether the chelating agent can cope  with  the  issue  of  ion  absorption  and  if  the  chelating  agent  itself can induce the fluorescent expression of our bacteria.</P><P class="titleTwo" style="color:#0070c0;font-size: 20px;">Growth Curve</P><P class="titleTwo" style="color:#0070c0;font-size: 20px;">Fluorescence Intensity</P><P class="titleTwo" style="color:#0070c0;font-size: 20px;">Discussion</P><P class="contentP">Although we manipulated a few slight changes between data, but we  can  still  acknowledge  an  abstract  of  different  Chinese  Medicine. Aside  from  Scutellaria,  Bupleurum,  and  Ligusticum  (last  two  not shown), the other 6 Chinese Medicine appears to be auspicious to the growth  curve  and  fluorescence  intensity  of  the  E.  coli.  With  our estimation, we guess that our E. coli can endure a bulk proportion of 
Chinese  Herb;  as  for  the  few  herbs  that  may  stifle  the  results,  we hope to create a data base for people to easily correspond to different herbs   and   know   our   product’s   detection   limit.   Fortunately,   we stumbled  across  a  paper  claiming  that  Scutellaria  absorbs  copper ions by its very own nature. Hence, it perfectly makes sense to the declining results of fluorescence overtime. To cope with this situation, we  decide  to  add  chelating  agents  into  our  product  to  prevent  the absorption.  Further  experiments  are  expected  to  examine  whether the  agent  will  or  will  not  interfere  the  bacteria,  and  the  efficiency  of different  material  agents.  Lastly,  we  find  that  copper  ions  at the concentration of 27 ppm (the law standard in Taiwan is 20 ppm) may suppress  the  growth  and  survival  of  bacteria;  yet,  the  remaining bacteria  can  express  a  high  level  of  fluorescence  intensity,  which means  they  still  great  potential  even  in  high  toxic  concentration levels.</P><P class="contentP">Meanwhile,   we   think   that   the   initial   bacteria   count   may immensely  influence  our  experiment  time.  Due  to  the  fact  that  we want  to  create  a  rapid  scanning,  we  might  increase  the  bacterial density after this series of Chinese medicine experiments.</P><P class="contentP" style="font-size: 16px;text-align:center">Graph 3.

EDTA is short for ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and is a commonly used chelating agent today. This agent is proven to  be little  harm  to  human’s  health  and  is  widely  applied  on  medical treatment  such  as  treating  heavy  metal  poisoning1.  Hence,  we  take advantage  of  this  harmless  yet  efficient  chelating  agent  and  hope  to ligand the ions inside the medicine.</P><P class="titleTwo" style="color:#0070c0;font-size: 20px;">Growth Curve</P><P class="titleTwo" style="color:#0070c0;font-size: 20px;">Fluorescence Intensity</P><P class="titleTwo" style="color:#0070c0;font-size: 20px;">Discussion</P><P class="contentP">From graph 17 and graph 18, we can assume that EDTA alone will not interfere with the growth rate of our E. coli. Also, we can see  that  the  component  of  EDTA  combined  with  copper  ion  can still  regulate  the  fluorescence  expression  of  our  bacteria. From bar  chart  1  and  bar  chart  2,  there  is  a  significant  sign  that some Chinese  Medicine,  Scutellariae  in  this  case,  indeed  stifles  the expression  of  fluorescence.  So,  to  deal  with  this  issue,  adding  a chelating  agent  can  be  ideal.  In  this  case,  our  chelating  agent EDTA   can   even   enhance   the   intensity   of   our   bacteria.   In conclusion,  our  chelating  agent  is  an  appropriate  solution  to  the problem of Chinese Medicine absorption.</P><P class="contentP" style="font-size: 16px;text-align:center">Graph 17.
