In this study, we utilize the mean field theory and the 4th Runge-Kutta method to simulate the engineering synthetic genetic circuits in Escherichia coli (E. coli), including the small RNA (sRNA) regulations and autoregulation circuits. For sRNA level in E. coli, the near simultaneously regulations that decrease (or increase) the target mRNA disable (enable) the target protein function. Therefore, the phase space for induction-regulation plays a key role and should be thoroughly investigated by simulations. In comparison with the sRNA level, the simulations and experimental methods based on the autoregulation circuit (Ptet-TetR) are designed to quantitatively describe the reporter protein or fluorescence response. The Hill coefficient is also checked to disclose the intrinsic properties of the autoregulation circuits in E. coli. </P><P class="titleTwo" id="1-2">Regulation</P><P class="titleTwo" style="color:#0070c0;font-size: 20px;">The introduction for genetic circuits</P><P class="contentP"><B>There are three types of commonly used genetic regulations: </B></P><P class="contentP"><B>Negative regulation</B> —Protein  (repressor) inhibits transcription (Ex.
