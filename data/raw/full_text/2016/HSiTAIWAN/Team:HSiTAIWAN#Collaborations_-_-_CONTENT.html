Thus, we are curious and concerned about what gene technology related information in the media that the Taiwanese people are exposed to and whether the Taiwanese people can understand the information.  Thus, we told the NYMU-Taipei team about our idea to consult them.  NYMU-Taipei revealed their passion to iGEM and ambitiously suggested that we should do something for iGEM to support its influence on synthetic biology worldwide.  </P><P class="contentP"><B>Goal:</B> Thus, we decided to work together to conduct a large-scaled media analysis on the gene technology related information to make it as a significant project for GTSB.  In this way, using social study methods, we can provide solid and essential academic evidences that can be used in future design, plan, and implement science education in GTSB.  Thus, our goal is to investigate the media context on gene technology related information, and identify issues of the context.  </P><P class="contentP"><B>Work on media analysis project:</B> We analyzed the sufficiency and readability of media context on gene technology related information from magazines, newspapers and iGEM wiki.  We worked on defining the goal and scope of this project together.  NYMU-Taipei was in charge of establishing conceptual framework of our media analysis, designing survey sheets (codebook) based on the framework, and retrieving iGEM wiki; HSiTAIWAN is in charge of designing survey sheets(codebook), accomplishing data collection.  We analyze the data together and the results can be retrieved from the section of the Human Practice section on two teams.  </P><P class="titleTwo" id="1-2">Academic conference, meetings, lab work</P><P class="contentP"> We are fortunate to have opportunities to work with two iGEM teams of <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:NTHU_Taiwan/Collaborations" style="color:#e59493 ;font-size: 17px;">NTHU_Taiwan</A> (Figure 1) and NYMU-Taipei. We worked together for discussing problems we faced and together figured out solutions for improving the protein performance in experiements.  In addition to attending the 4th iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference 2016 Taiwan, we have many chances to discuss our iGEM project with these two universities.   Particularly, NYMU-Taipei team gave us lectures which are crucial for us to proceed our project,  gave us technical supports  when we had problems, provided us lab rooms and supervised our lab work. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
