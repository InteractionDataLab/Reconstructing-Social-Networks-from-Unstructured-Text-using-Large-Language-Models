Oh hello there,I am Charlie,a trusty member of the "Herb Tasters" and also the brainiest E. coli in the colony.
I know all the secrets of Chinese herbs and their magical healing powers.
If you are up to a challenge,find me at team HSiTW at the jamboree.
I am the one in a straw hat,showing them pearls.I will be waiting.
Muhahahahaha
Hi there! My name is Nu Zhen Chi. This is how I look like.
Take a closer look; guess which part of me is used as medicine?
(1) the root
(2) the stem
(3) the leaf
(4) the seed
Ans.(4) the seed
Name: 女貞子 (Nu Zhen Chi)
Botanical Name: Ligustrum lucidum Aiton
I can treat people who are yin deficient, and liver problems that cause dizziness,cataract of the eyes,
lower back pain, premature graying of the hair and tinnitus.
Hello! My name is Chuan Xiong. This is how I look like.
Make a guess, which part of me is used as medicine?
(1) the root
(2) the stem
(3) the leaf
(4) the seed
Ans.(1) the root
Name: 川芎 (Chuan Xiong)
Botanical Name: Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort
I help with blood regulation to prevent relevant to blood stasis and non-stop bleeding.I can also strengthen your qi circulation.
In addition, I relieve you of physical pain,          such as headaches, abdominal aches, chest pain, and muscle pain.
Finally, I free the ladies of menstrual disorders and amenorrhea.
What’s up? My name is Dang Gui. I can:
(1) stop coughing
(2) regulate mense
(3) reduce internal heat
Ans.(2) Regulate mense
Name: 當歸 (Dang Gui)
Botanical Name: Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels
I can remove blood stasis and clots, so I am usually used to regulate menses,lubricate intestines to correct constipation, reduce swelling, expel pus.

As Experiment
Functional Assay "Click here to see Copper"
Functional assay is to ensure that our E.coli can survive and produce green fluorescence under arsenic. We measure the absorbance value every 30 minutes in order to know whether it can survive under arsenic. Then, we measure the fluorescence to test it’s function of producing green fluorescent protein. The excitation and emission we measure the fluorescent intensity is 485nm and 538nm.
Growth Rate
Results:
Figure 1: In this figure, we find that when arsenic concentration is under 100ppm, it doesn’t affect the growth of E. coli.
GFP in Arsenic Solution
Results:
Figure 2: Fluorescence intensity in arsenic solution.
Figure 3: Fluorescence intensity / Optical density in arsenic solution.
We can see that our E.coli produces more green fluorescence in higher arsenic concentration and as well as stronger fluorescence.
Chinese Medicine "Click here to see Copper"
The structure of Chinese medicine is complex, so after the functional assay, we tested our E.coli in chinese medicine to check if chinese medicine affects the production of green fluorescence. The excitation and emission we measure the fluorescent intensity is 485nm and 538nm.
Results:
Figure 4: Fluorescence intensity in Licorice with arsenic.
Figure 5: Fluorescence intensity in Angelica with arsenic.
Figure 6: Fluorescence intensity in Mint with arsenic.
Figure 7: Fluorescence intensity in Modified Ease Powder with arsenic.
In these figure(Figure.4~7), we can see that in the environment with Chinese medicine, in higher arsenic concentration, our e. coli produces more fluorescence.
Figure 8: Fluorescence intensity / Optical density in Licorice with arsenic.
Figure 9: Fluorescence intensity / Optical density in Angelica with arsenic.
Figure 10: Fluorescence intensity / Optical density in Mint with arsenic.
Figure 11: Fluorescence intensity / Optical density in Modified Ease Powder with arsenic.
In figure 8~11, we find that when as the amount of bacteria increases, the fluorescent intensity in a single cell rises as well.
Figure 12-15
Figure 12: Comparison of Fluorescence intensity between solution with Licorice and without Chinese medicine.
Figure 13: Comparison of Fluorescence intensity between solution with Angelica and without Chinese medicine.
Figure 14: Comparison of Fluorescence intensity between solution with Mint and without Chinese medicine.
Figure 15: Comparison of Fluorescence intensity between solution with Modified Ease Powder and without Chinese medicine.
The fluorescence intensity curves between the group Chinese medicine added in and the group without Chinese medicine coincides, this can prove that Chinese medicine doesn’t affect the activation of our promoter.
