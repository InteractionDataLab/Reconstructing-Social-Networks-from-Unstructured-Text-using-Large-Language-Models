And the difficulties the government face when it comes to educating people the correct knowledge about Chinese Medicine and finding the appropriate law standards. Meanwhile, the government officers asked a few technical questions to clarify how our product may work, and the background of creating a rapid scanning device. The government sector is excited to hear that we decided to invent a rapid scanning based on biotechnology. They assured us that they will eagerly promote our project to all, once the product has overcome the difficulties and is proven to function well. Moreover, they were impressed that we high school students highly value the importance of Chinese Medicine at such a young age.</P><P class="titleTwo" style="color:#0070c0;font-size: 20px;text-indent:3%"> Food and Drug Administration, Ministry of Health &amp; Welfare</P><P class="contentP">The safety and quality of food, drugs, medical devices and cosmetics are integral parts to promote the high standard of the national life style, health concerns and medical treatment.

The Congress in Taiwan has a wide range of powers, including enacting and amending legislation, reviewing and approving budgets, and adopting treaties among other important affairs of the State. She has been devoted to environmental protection for decades. Her career highlighs include the founder of Yilan Branch, Taiwan environmental protection union, convener of Taiwan Environmental Protection Union, Excutive Secretary of Anti-Sixth Naphtha Cracking Plan Association, Director General of Qulan Cypress National Park Promotion Association.</P><P class="titleTwo" style="color:#538135 ;font-size: 18px;">A Public Engagement with Deputy Minister Ms. Chiu-Chin Tien</P><P class="contentP">The objective of this visit was to learn the health and environment challenges our society now face, as well as promote our project idea and ask for feedback.</P><P class="contentP">We realized that even the Congress is aware the importance of environmental protection and health hazards relevant to Chinese medicines contaminations. The challenges of monitoring the safety of Chinese medicines our government face including the regulations and survillence system for imported goods, and the costs of conducting systematic survey on toxins in Chinese medicines. The government alone cannot resolve all problems because of the constant financial shortage. Also, the government supports synthetic biology, but still has a few regulations and concerns when it engages in” To what extend will the modified be taken?” “If there is something wrong, will people be able to notice in the first place?” “Will the product or creation be consumed by human or inserted in a human?”</P><P class="contentP">We learned that the most vital difficulty the government face is that there is not enough budget and technicians to detect all the imported goods. Our product has the potential to save a fortune and ease the pressure of governors. From a senior policymaker’s perspective, Deputy Ministor Ms. Chiu-Chin Tien is positive about our project and views it as a promising method to deal with the problems we now face! The final highlight of this visit was greeting with Mr. Po-Lin Chi. Mr. Chi is the director of Beyong Beauty-Taiwan from Above. The film is documenting Taiwan from an aerial perspective offering a glimpse of Taiwan's natural beauty as well as the effect of human activities and urbanization on our environment. We are touched by knowing that everyone has to play a watchdog role to protect our beautiful island, all kinds of environment resources, and people’s health.</P><P class="titleTwo" style="color:#0070c0;font-size: 20px;">Legislator Man-Li Chen</P><P class="titleTwo" style="color:#538135 ;font-size: 18px;">A Public Engagement with Legislator Man-Li Chen</P><P class="contentP" style="text-indent:0%"><B>What key issues we discussed and learned?</B></P><P class="contentP">Legislator Man-Li Chen currently serves in Social Welfare and Environmental Hygiene Committee. This Committee is responsible to deliberate policies of health, environment, labor affairs, and consumer protection, and bills related to powers of Department of Health, Environmental Protection Administration, The Consumer Protection Commission, Council of labor affairs, Executive Yuan, and Department of Social Affairs Ministry of Interior. Before being a legislator, she was the chairman of Environmental Defense Fund of Homemakers’ United Foundation, the chairman of National Federation of Taiwan Women’s Organization, a member of National Council for Sustainable Development, and Director of Legal Aid Foundation. </P><P class="contentP">To enact a law on Chinese medicine, there should be a considerable number of reported cases. However, people who tend to take Chinese medicine are more likely to have a weak body in the first place, which may cause a confusion when symptoms of poisoning occurs. Secondly, toxin in Chinese medicine accumulates gradually overtime. Thus, patients cannot be sure of the cause during the chronic phase of heavy metal accumulation. Third, some groups of Chinese medicine are classified as food supplies while others categorized as drugs. Hence, this will lead to another problem in law legislation. As for feedbacks, the governor suggests us that we promote our product to youngsters. For example, hold a science camp where students are allowed to bring home a DIY product and test their grandparents’ prescription from the traditional drug store. This way, we can avoid being targeted by Chinese medicine manufacturers and successfully spread our ideas to the society. Generally speaking, the government sees synthetic biology as a vital technology to change the future and is totally for us.</P><P class="titleTwo" id="1-3">NGO</P><P class="contentP">Homemakers United Foundation (HUF) was set up by a group of homemakers committed to environmental protection in 1989.

Most people want to have the highest quality of Chinese medicine, yet they refuse to pay more money for the merchandiser to import goods. And people without background knowledge only values Chinese medicine by its price rather than the medicine’s beneficial features. We also learned that every country has their own law standards of imported Chinese medicine. If our regulations for Chinese medicine raises too high, most goods will be sold to countries with lower law criteria; however, if we press the law standards way too low, the quality of the imports will suffer. Thus, law legislation for Chinese medicine is greatly varied by the trend of trading abroad.</P><P class="contentP">We are excited to learn that an article discussing the need of regulation amending Chinese medicines was just publised in their periodical, June 2016. Apparently, we share the same vision and mission to protect people’s health. We believe that our product is not to solve all the problems of Chinese medicine contamination by itself, but rather to raise awareness among people. We do not want traditional pharmacies to close down. We want people to believe that they should try to consider the daily substance by themselves.</P><P class="contentP" style="font-size:16px;text-align:left;"><B>Figure 3.</B>Foundation constantly observes and advocates environmental protection issues occurred around the world, espeically in Taiwan.

Because a wide variety of metal and ions might interfere the results, the singularity in identifying becomes very important. Also, many harmful elements don’t always come in the form of ions. Unmodified specimens are most likely to be difficult to detect one specific toxin. Thus, we should also come up with a way to detect different forms of elements and compare its results to those made from an official laboratory.</P><P class="contentP" style="text-indent:0%"><B>What have we learned?</B></P><P class="contentP">1.Understand what entrepreneurs think about food crisis and bio engineering.
