Oh hello there,I am Charlie,a trusty member of the "Herb Tasters" and also the brainiest E. coli in the colony.
I know all the secrets of Chinese herbs and their magical healing powers.
If you are up to a challenge,find me at team HSiTW at the jamboree.
I am the one in a straw hat,showing them pearls.I will be waiting.
Muhahahahaha
Hi there! My name is Nu Zhen Chi. This is how I look like.

(3) the leaf
(4) the seed
Ans.(4) the seed
Name: 女貞子 (Nu Zhen Chi)
Botanical Name: Ligustrum lucidum Aiton
I can treat people who are yin deficient, and liver problems that cause dizziness,cataract of the eyes,
lower back pain, premature graying of the hair and tinnitus.
Hello! My name is Chuan Xiong. This is how I look like.
Make a guess, which part of me is used as medicine?
(1) the root
(2) the stem
(3) the leaf
(4) the seed
Ans.(1) the root
Name: 川芎 (Chuan Xiong)
Botanical Name: Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort
I help with blood regulation to prevent relevant to blood stasis and non-stop bleeding.I can also strengthen your qi circulation.
In addition, I relieve you of physical pain,          such as headaches, abdominal aches, chest pain, and muscle pain.
Finally, I free the ladies of menstrual disorders and amenorrhea.
What’s up? My name is Dang Gui. I can:

Objective:
Measure the growth rate of E. coli DH5α in arsenic solution
Material:
DH5α pcDNA (ctrl) on LB agar plates
SOC broth
Amp (1000 X)
15 ml tube, 50 ml tube
96 well plate
Procedure:
Rpm 120:
1.Culture 3 tubes of 2ml E. coli overnight by 15ml centrifuge tubes (2ml SOC, 2ul AMP)
2.Put them to the same tube at the next day, then add 6ml of SOC broth(water bath 37°C  for 5 min. before use)and 12ul AMP for a 2-fold dilution.
3.Take 5ml SOC broth for to a 15ml centrifuge tube for blank
4.Aliquot the bacterial broth into six 15ml centrifuge tubes (2ml for each), then culture for 2 hours
5.Measure OD 595
6.Dilute to OD 0.5. More than 12ml
Rpm 80:
1.100, 50, 30, 10, 1ppm arsenic solutions, use ddH2O in control group
2.Dilute the E. coli broth to 50 fold by SOC broth (0.6ml E. coli broth+0.3ml Arsenic solutuin+30ul AMP 29.1ml SOC broth）
3.Measure OD at 0 min. measure every 30 min. Blank is needed every time.
Arsenic solution preparation:
100ppm: 104 As solution 0.3ml
50ppm: 104 As solution 0.15ml + ddH2O 0.15ml
30ppm: 104 As solution 0.09ml + ddH2O 0.21ml
10ppm: 103 As solution 0.3ml
1ppm: 102 As solution 0.3ml
Results:
2016/08/23 ～ 08/24
Objective:
Measure the fluorescence intensity in arsenic solution
Material:
DH5α arsenic plasmid (ctrl) on LB agar plates
SOC broth
Chloramphenicol(1000 X)
15 ml tube, 50 ml tube

Rpm 80:
1.100, 50, 30, 10, 1ppm arsenic solutions, use ddH2O in control group
2.Dilute the E. coli broth to 50 fold by SOC broth (0.6ml E. coli broth+0.3ml Arsenic solutuin+30ul Chloramphenicol 29.1ml SOC broth）
3.Measure it's fluorescence intensity and OD at 0 min. measure every 30 min. Blank is needed every time.
Arsenic solution preparation:
100ppm: 104 As solution 0.3ml
50ppm: 104 As solution 0.15ml + ddH2O 0.15ml
