Topic: Plasmid Functional ArrayResults
Material:
Centrifugation Machine
Pipetman
Bleach
Procedure:
1.Centrifuge the culturing tubes at 8000rmp for 5 minutes.
2.Remove excess liquid from the top, leaving E. coli chunks below.
3.Observe the fluorescence of thebacteria.
4.Add bleach to the liquidwaste to sanitize.
Results:
1.Copper(Cu2+)
The E. coli (k1555000) in copper ions showed obvious green fluorescence feature from 10-1to 102ppm (figure 1). However, the tube containing 103ppm seemed transparent (figure 2). Thus, we assumed that the bacteria died in the high concentration.
2.Lead (Pb2+)
The E  coli  (k1613017)  expressed  a  vague  red  glow  at  the concentrationsof 10-1to 103 ppm (figure 3), but more visible in 102and 103ppm (figure 3).
To conclude, the two plasmids (copper and lead) appeared to be functional. Hence, we can continue with our projectand will begin to test herb samples.

Topic: Fluorescence Intensity, Growth Rate Results
Results:
From graph 1, we can see that the growth rate of bacteria in a concentration of 5*10-4M (approximately 3.2*100ppm) to 5*10-14M (approximately 3.2*10-10ppm) does not differ. That is to say, that the survival rate, reproductive rate of our bacteria is not interfered. However, the growth rate of our positive control appears to be lower than the other samples. We are guessing it is because the strong green fluorescence disturbs the wave absorption at the wavelength of 600nm, which is commonly used to measure the optical density of bacteria. Keep in mind that for the purpose of easy labeling, the “positive control” here is not a genuine control of our testing of optical density, it is the positive control for fluorescence intensity testing (k608010). So, the true positive control for this experiment should be the “negative control”, which is the sample that contains no copper ion in its environment. Also from the same graph, we can see that the bacteria manipulate every hour and areespecially significant after 5 hours. From  graph 2, we  can  examine  that  the  growth  of  fluorescence intensity over the past 8 hours. The fluorescence expression rises rapidly after culturing for 5 hours, which matches perfectly that the fluorescence intensity does have a positive correlation with the amount of susceptible bacteria. Withal, we cannot be sure if it is the bacteria amount or the fluorescence itself that grows overtime that causes the expression to enhance. We are willing to do a further investigation. On bar chart 1, we can see not only the fluorescence change throughout time, but also the expression intensity in different concentration levels. The higher concentration, the stronger fluorescence is expressed. Since we  have  analyzed  from  optical  density  testing,  we  know  that  a concentration of 5*10-4M of copper ion does not affect the growth of E. coli and has the best expression; our further experiments will be designed to control the environment to be around 5*10-4M.

Topic:Soc, LB Medium Testing
Material:
E. coli(k1555000, k806010)
SOCmedium
LB medium
Chloramphenicol
3ppm Copper ion solution
Procedure:
1.Culture 4 tubes of different bacteria in different medium.
2.Incubate the bacteria overnight.
3.Test the four bacteria sample’s optical density at a wavelength of 600nm.
4.Dilute the bacterial fluid until its O.D value reaches 0.5.
5.Duplicate the samples.
6.Culture the samples in a37°Crotating incubator at 80rpm.
7.Test  the  optical  density  and  fluorescence  intensity  of  the samples every hour.
8.Make a microscopic slide when the fluorescence intensity is steady.
Results:
The initial optical density of bacterial fluid is shown in table1, then, we diluted the samples into O.D =0.5 by the following formula in the table. In graph1, we can see thatthe growth rate of the four sample types increased overtime. Although the bacteria growth rate in SOC does not seem to be higher than that in LB medium, contrary to what we have done before.We tested that bacteria (DH5alfa) cultured in SOC tends to grow faster than in LB. We assume this result is because of the disturbance of fluorescence the bacteria give off. That is the green fluorescence interferes with the absorbance wavelength. Graph2 shows that fluorescence intensity is more expressed in LB than in SOC.
We guess it is  due to the fact  that  bacteria grow too  fast in  SOC, causing  them  unable  to  produce  adequate  fluorescence  protein.  In figure1, we took photos of the four sample types under fluorescence spectrometry after 4 hours of culturing. There is significant difference of  the  fluorescence  intensity. Also,  there  is  a  slight  notice  that  the bacterial density is denser when cultured in SOC medium. Moreover, we know that thefluorescence intensity has a positive relation with the original bacterial count. Hence, we plan to increase the optical density after initial process, so that our fluorescence could be more luminous in the future.

SOC medium (with antibiotic)
Procedure:
Results:
The purpose of this experiment is to make up the gap between 9ppm to 27ppm, in which we find two very different growth curve pattern. Thus, we decided to choose the concentration levels of 10, 15, and 20ppm. In graph 1, we can see that the growth curve of each individual concentration level differs. And as the concentration level rises, the growth curve slackens correspondently. In graph 2, we can see that there are similar results in fluorescence intensity testing. The intensity is strongly relevant to the concentration of copper ions. In other words, the concentration levels are consistent to the growth curve and fluorescence expression. We can assume that there will be little gap between different concentration detected. This is excellent news to prove that our project and product can be quantitative.

Procedure:
1.Add Cu2+ions ([Cu2+
2.Place the solution in a 4°C freezer for 16 hours.
3.
Results:
From graph 1, we can assume that EDTA alone will not interfere with the expression of our E. coli. Also, we can see that the component of EDTA combined with copper ion can still regulate the fluorescence expression of our bacteria. From bar chart 1, there is a significant sign that some Chinese Medicine, Scutellariae in this case, indeed stifles the expression  of  fluorescence.  So,  to  cope  with  this  issue,  adding  a chelating agent can be ideal. In this case, our chelating agent EDTA can  even  enhance  the  intensity  of  our  bacteria.  In  conclusion,  our chelating agent is an appropriate solution to the problem of Chinese Medicine absorption.
