Arsenic
Introduction
Arsenic contamination is severe problem which affects millions of people all around the world. As(III) compounds such as AsH3 and As2O3 are easily absorbed by human body, and when excessive arsenic is absorbed, it will wreck our immune system and destroy our cell’s ability to redox reaction, this will affect the metabolism of the cell. Also, it can damage our DNA and inhibit the DNA repair. Causing poison, cancer and even death.
Arsenic and Arsenic Toxicity
There are two kinds of arsenic, organic arsenic and inorganic arsenic and inorganic arsenic is more toxic to human among the two, and can cause devastating effects to our body.
Exposure Source or Route
Water, which irrigates plants, is most likely to be contaminated by arsenic. The plants will absorb arsenic, if water that irrigates it is contaminated, and people will be poisoned.
Regulation
Taiwan Regulation
The limit of arsenic formulated by Ministry of Health and Welfare is 5ppm.
Circuit Design and Parts
Circuit fig:
Sequence:
Result
ArsR, which is constantly produced protein which represses the gene expression downstream and also represses itself by binding to ArsR binding site upstream. When inducer arsenates or arsenites exists in our E. coli. ArsR loses affinity to the operator, and the gene circuit will be switched on. Then, E. coli will produce and express green fluorescence.
Our modelling result fits with our real data very well.  Our hill coefficient is 1.0077.
