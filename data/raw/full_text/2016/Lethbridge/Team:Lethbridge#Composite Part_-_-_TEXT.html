Improved Parts
We improved a collection of parts this semester.
BBa_K2109111 - MS2 expression module containing a modifed MS2 protein to prevent dimerization to allow for higher yields during purification. Additionally a N-Terminal His tag was added and expression is modulated via a T7 promoter and strong RBS.
BBa_K2109108 - Mazf kill switch construct improved by adding RBS and testing the effects of evolutionary dirft.
