Improve Previous Part
We decreased leaky expression of a downstream lethal gene in a killswitch part from BNU China.
We improved several parts from our previous iGEM project.

Collaborations
This season, we worked with several teams including Marburg, Bielefeld, and Lethbridge HS.
Collaborations
Human Practices
Our project was designed hand in hand EMS personnel in order to develop a way to detect pathogens in emergency vehicles.

Integrated Human Practices
From the ground up, our project has involved the EMS personnel that will be using our device to determine what pathogens are present in emergency vehicles, and if the vehicles function as vectors for infection.
Integrated Practices
Applied Design
We took the feedback from our interactions with stakeholders in order create the design principles that would guide the development of our device.
