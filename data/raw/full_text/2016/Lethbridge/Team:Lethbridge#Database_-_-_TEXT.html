Single Domain Antibody Database (SDAB-DB)
We have established the first dedicated single domain antibody repository and database. The database will host a large collection of natural and synthetic camelid single domain antibody sequences from literature sources, other online repositories (e.g. GenBank), and manual entries from users. Single domain antibodies in the database may be searched for by their assigned name(s), antigen targets, and source (e.g. lama or synthetic) amongst other features. Complete amino acid sequences will be available for antibodies as well as their demonstrated uses (e.g. Western blot) and literature citations.
