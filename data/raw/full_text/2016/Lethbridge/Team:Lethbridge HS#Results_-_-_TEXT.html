The half clot time of different treatments on the blood was tested and calculated. Specifically, the clotting time of our blood was tested with 70mg of heparin as well as 71mg of heparin in different trials, in addition to either 1mL or 2mL of PNRA or 1mL or 2mL of our construct in order to determine the effects of our construct on the blood clotting pathway. A positive control was also set by having blood with heparin with no cells, to ensure the blood did not spontaneously clot on its own. In general, we were able to show that our construct caused the blood to clot. Although these are preliminary tests, we plan to optimize our construct further in the future in order to determine the resulting flow rates after our construct is applied to ensure that it does not impact the rate of blood flow throughout the rest of the patientâ€™s body.
