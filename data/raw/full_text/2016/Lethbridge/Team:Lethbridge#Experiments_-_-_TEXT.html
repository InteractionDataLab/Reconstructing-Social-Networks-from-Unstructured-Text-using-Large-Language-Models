Sampling Protocol
Prior to sampling, kits were prepared in house under sterile conditions. Each kit consisted of:
Tweezers
Large KimWipes
Nitrile Gloves
70% ethanol
12 micro centrifuge tubes (4 per ambulance)
15 mm filter paper (1 per tube)
In the biological safety cabinet, 500 µL of 70% ethanol was pipetted into 2mL micro centrifuge tubes. Filter paper was carefully added to each tube and the tube was labelled to indicate the ambulance sampled, sample location and sampling week.
Sampling took place at the main Fire Station in downtown Lethbridge over the course of one month. Ambulances 1, 9 and 10 were sampled every Friday at 7:00pm and were on call at this time. Extra precautions were put in place to maintain sterility and avoid sample contamination. Nitrile gloves were worn by team members taking samples and 70% ethanol was used to sterilize gloves and tweezers, which were used to remove the filter paper from the micro centrifuge tubes after each location was sampled. Large KimWipes were used to dry the gloves before the next location was sampled.
The first area sampled was the SPO2 finger monitor located in the heart rate monitor kit. The filter paper was removed from the micro centrifuge tube to swipe the bottom part of the finger monitor where the patients finger would be inserted. Dimensions of the area swiped was approximately 2 cm x 2 cm. The filter paper was then carefully placed back in the centrifuge tube. Gloves and tweezers were cleaned with ethanol between samples. This process was repeated for sampling of the rear interior door handle and bottom of the soft kit. The sampling area was similar in size for each location to maintain consistency throughout the sampling protocol. Following data collection, the samples were stored at -20०C until further processing.

MinION Sequencing Protocol
Adapted from [4]
Assemble MinION and MinION flow cell
Set up MinKNOW to run the Platform QC – name the run and start the protocol script
Allow the script to run to completion and the number of active pores are reported
Prime the flow cell for the library to be loaded when the library preparation is complete
Prepare priming buffer: 500 µL of NFW and 500 µL RBF1
Prime the flow cell: Open the sample port and using a 1000 µL pipette draw back the buffer in the flow cell to make sure there is a continuous buffer flow from the sample port across the sensor array
Load 500 µL of the priming buffer using a vertical 1000 µL pipette and tip in a continuous flow avoiding introducing air bubbles or disturbing the sensor array. Wait 10 minutes, then repeat the loading and wait another 10 minutes
Load the prepared library: mix the pre sequencing mix by inversion 10x, briefly spin down the library
Add the reagents in the following order: 75 µL RBF1, 63 µL of dd H2O and 12 µL of the pre sequencing mix kept on ice
Load 150 µL of the library loading mix via the sample port, close the cover and the MinION lid
Start the sequencing script in MinKNOW and the workflow in the Metrichor Agent
Return to MinKNOW, name the run, select the MAP_48Hr_Sequencing_Run_SQK_MAP006.py and start using the start in the MinKNOW dialogue box.
Open the Desktop Agent, select the latest version of the barcoding plus 2D basecalling, run the workflow and monitor the workflow using the visualization options in details
MinKNOW will report the number of pores available for the sequencing before data collection begins. These may differ from those reported in the Platform QC
Allow the protocol to proceed until MinKNOW reports Finished Successfully. Use the stop in the control panel to finish the protocol
Quit the Desktop Agent, close down MinKNOW and disconnect the MinION
Sequencing Data Analysis
Following the flow cell run, the raw data was obtained as fast5 files using MinKNOW software version 1.0.8.0 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), The electric signals in the raw files were converted to sequence (base calling) using 2D Basecalling workflow in Metrichor Agent version 2.40.17.  Basecalled data passing quality control and filtering were downloaded and basic statistical analysis was carried out using poretools [5] program. The reads outputted as fasta files were processed for metagenomics analysis using mothur [6] and Taxonomer [7]

SLIC
Adapted from [8]
Step 1: Generate linear DNA fragments via polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Design forward and reverse PCR primers that bind to the template DNA (~18-25 nt) with 20-30 nt 5’ extensions that overlap adjacent DNA fragments
For each DNA fragment to be assembled, set up individual PCR reactions consisting of: 25 μL 2 X Phusion DNA Pol Master Mix, HF buffer; 2.5 μL Forward PCR primer, 10 μM; 2.5 μL Reverse PCR primer, 10 μM;  X μL* Template DNA (10 – 100 ng); Y μL* MilliQ ddH2O (50 μL Total reaction volume)
* Note: adjust the volume of template DNA/MilliQ ddH2O to make up 50 μL total volume
PCR thermocycling conditions (annealing temp, extension time, etc.*) will need to be determined for individual reactions, however use the following guidelines: Initial denaturation 98 °C, 30 sec Denaturation, 98 °C 15 sec Annealing, X °C 20 sec Extension, 72 °C Y sec (~30 sec/kb) Final extension, 72 °C 2 – 5 min Hold, 4 °C Indefinite
*Note: for each primer pair, determine the optimal annealing temperature using the Thermo Scientific website Tm calculator, with Phusion DNA Polymerase settings.
Check PCR products on an agarose gel. PCR products should be a single band that runs at the expected size. PCR products that have additional non-specific amplicons should be gel-purified to isolate the desired PCR band and possibly re-amplified
Purify PCR products using BioBasic spin columns and the PCR cleanup protocol, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Elute PCR products in 40 μL of nuclease-free MilliQ ddH2O and quantitate the DNA using the BioDrop apparatus
Step 2: Chew-back DNA 3’ ends using T4 DNA Polymerase
For each DNA fragment, assemble the following components in a 1.5 mL microfuge tube in the following order:
2 μL 10 X NEBuffer 2.1; X μL DNA fragment (500 – 1000 ng total); Y μL MilliQ ddH2O; 1 μL T4 DNA Polymerase, 0.3 U/μL (Make dilution in 1 X NEBuffer 2.1); 1 μL Dpn I (10 U/μL). 20 μL Total reaction volume.
Incubate chew-back reactions for 30 minutes at 37 °C.
Arrest chew-back by adding 2 uL of 10 mM dCTP and then place tubes on ice.
Step 3: Assemble DNA fragments and transform into E. coli
Based on the amount of DNA added to the chew-back reaction and the length of DNA fragments, determine the amount of each chew-back reaction needed to make an e quimolar mixture of each fragment that totals to at least 1 μg DNA (1,000 ηg DNA). For example, to assemble three DNA fragments of 7000 bp, 1500 bp and 900 bp at a concentration of 50 ng/uL each in chew-back reactions one would calculate (total volume = 26.8μL:
Fragment
DNA size

Incubate mixtures at 37°C for 10 minutes, then purify the DNA mixture on a BioBasic Spin column using the cleanup procedure an enzymatic reaction and elute the DNA in 40 μL MilliQ ddH2O.
Use 2 μL of the DNA mixture (~100 ηg) for transformation into E. coli high-efficiency chemically competent or electrocompetent cells.
