HP Project Timeline
On ------, we participated in the Museum of Science's "Building with Biology" event. At this event, we assisted in guiding a forum discussion open to members of the public. The subject of the forum was genetically engineering mosquitoes to control their population. The forum consisted of a short presentation followed by the members of the public breaking into groups of five to ten to discuss how and/if genetically engineered mosquitoes should be implemented. With our team mediating the discussion, members of the public were able to learn key principles of synthetic biology, as well as consider the applications and ethical implications of the field. This experience taught us that forums could act as an tool to make synthetic biology interesting and accessible to the public.
