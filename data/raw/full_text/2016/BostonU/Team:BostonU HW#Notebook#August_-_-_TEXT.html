TIMELINE: AUGUST
Notebook
Rebranded and designed a new logo for Neptune
Expanded mÎ¼Shroom Mapper to include new primitives such as cell traps, and valves
Automated the creation of Fluigi's .ini file by scale spacing to port and channel size
Connected the Specify and Control pages so that the design and parameters of the microfluidic devices would be passed on to the control system
Refactored file system so that the user can access them in their local directories as opposed to on the cloud
Created two new pages for Build and Assembly to host the hardware and the setup for the entire system
Firmware calibrated to include even fluid dispension for each step
Finalized hardware infrastructure and started creating MEC compatible hardware as well as MEC boards
Completed integration with 3DuF (visualization tool) and the control page so that the chip can be visualized within the control page
Proceeded with NONA by providing them with deliverables such as tags, documentation, description of software, attributions, and more detailed information about Neptune
Implemented a new dispenser user interface to show the user if they are pulling or pushing liquid, and how much liquid they have available
