He was first turned on to the idea of participating with the iGEM team when he started working in Wilson Wong’s lab under the mentorship of Ben Weinberg in January 2016. He has nothing but extreme gratitude for the opportunity they have given him to grow as a scientist. Jeffrey intends to go on to graduate school doing a PhD in epidemiology and infectious diseases. His dream is to work with the CDC or WHO doing work in the field of tropical diseases, and ultimately take his experiences and teach a new generation of scientists. In his spare time, Jeffrey is an avid musician performing at bars and restaurants in both Boston as well as back in Westchester, NY. A fun fact about Jeffrey is that he has a twin brother, Jason, and he is an avid collector of art. Jeffrey's work with the iGEM team focused on the development of the genetic logic circuit used in our work as well as the writing you see on this wiki and co-authoring the bioethics forums.  In addition, he, along with the rest of the team, worked on the cloning that built the Gemini Library. </P><P id="ptwo" class="words" style="font-size:150%;">Kami is a senior studying biomedical engineering. She has worked in the Tissue Microfabrication Laboratory under Prof. Chris Chen since her sophomore year and decided to join the iGEM team to gain some insight into how synthetic biology could play an important role in the field of tissue engineering. She aspires to a career in medicine. In her spare time, Kami enjoys chasing after balls on the volleyball and tennis courts and painting masterpieces on canvas. When the sun is out, you’ll find her hiking or quadding through the trails of Vermont, and overall just enjoying the tranquility of nature. A fun fact about Kami is that she does not have an appendix. Kami's work with the iGEM team focused on mammalian cell culture for transfections, data analysis, and the design of the images and figures used by BostonU. In addition, she, along with the rest of the team, worked on the cloning that built the Gemini Library.</P><P id="pthree" class="words" style="font-size:150%;">Rachel Petherbridge is a sophomore studying biomedical engineering. She became interested in iGEM after spending a summer working with the CRISPR/dCas9 system in the Khalil Lab in high school. This interest grew when she took a position as an undergraduate research assistant in the same lab this past January Rachel plans to pursue a PhD/MD to become a medical researcher and practitioner, and eventually, a teacher. In her spare time, you can find Rachel in the FitRec center either taking a dance class or working out to stay in shape, involved with the BU Model United Nation events, or hanging out with Arrows-U, the undergraduate WISE club on campus, where she is Vice President. A fun fact about Rachel is that she is a dual citizen of both the US and UK, which explains her penchant for tea and Marmite on toast for breakfast each morning. Rachel's work with the iGEM team focused on the plasmid designs of the Gemini Library and data analysis. She is the co-author of our blog, &quot;Who Owns What,&quot; and our bioethics forums. In addition, she, along with the rest of the team, worked on the cloning that built the Gemini Library.</P><P id="pfour" class="words" style="font-size:150%;">Will is a junior studying biomedical engineering. He participated in iGEM in order to learn how research is conducted and gain the ability to perform useful lab techniques. Will hopes to continue on to grad school, pursue a PhD, and someday work in the field of DNA technology. He is highly interested in the field of synthetic biology both for its potential to solve real world problems and for its &quot;design and build&quot; nature. Outside of the lab, Will also has a strong interest in creative writing, and he enjoys writing stories as a hobby. Fun fact: Will plays the electric violin. Will's work with the iGEM team focused on the development of the wiki. In addition, he, along with the rest of the team, worked on the cloning that built the Gemini Library.</P><P id="pfive" class="words" style="font-size:150%;">Marisa Mendes is a junior studying biomedical engineering. She joined iGEM because she wanted to gain experience working in a lab to help her decide if she wants to pursue a research-oriented career path. As a child, she remembers looking at her hands and wondering what hands were made of and what allowed them to perform simple day-to-day tasks. She knew biomedical engineering was a subject she needed to pursue when she saw a brief news report that cardiac tissue had been synthesized in a lab and was able to pulse like a human heart. Now, she wants to mass-produce synthetic tissues to replace malfunctioning ones. When she is not playing the role of a student researcher, you can find Marisa in a theatre designing lights for her next production. Fun fact: the first time Marisa traveled away from her home in Southern California was for her freshman orientation at BU. Marisa's work with the iGEM team focused on our outreach projects, including coordinating with the Living Computing Project, and editing all written work, scientific or otherwise. In addition, she, along with the rest of the team, worked on the cloning that built the Gemini Library.</P></DIV></CENTER><CENTER><DIV style="font-size:300%; padding:40px 50px 25px 50px; text-align:center; color:#0071A7;">Advisors</DIV><DIV class="name" id="div"><B>Divya</B></DIV><DIV class="name" id="ben"><B>Ben</B></DIV><DIV class="name" id="lei"><B>Leidy</B></DIV><DIV class="name" id="lui"><B>Luis</B></DIV><DIV class="name" id="mary"><B>Mary</B></DIV><DIV id="para" style="height:320px;"><P id="psix" class="words" style="font-size:150%;">Divya is a 4th year PhD student in the Biomedical Engineering department at Boston University.
