InterLab Study
The iGEM Community is founded on the principle of tool and skill proliferation. With the Registry of Standard Biological Parts ever expanding, there still exists a need to unify the assaying techniques and results used by synthetic biologists to characterize these parts.
The Interlab Study was developed three years ago in attempt to study how fluorescence can be standardized over multiple labs. Traditionally, fluorescence is measured using MFI, Mean Fluorescence Intensity, an arbitrary unit of fluorescence. In the Interlab Study all fluorescence was measured in MEFL, Molecules of Equivalent Fluorescein, a standardized set of units based on the fluorescence of metallic collaboration beads.
In the first graph, you can see the geometric mean of the fluorescence of five devices of the Interlab study (Negative: R0040 Positive: I20270 Device 1: J23101.B0034.E0040.B0015 Device 2: J23106.B0034.E0040.B0015 Device 3: J23117.B0034.E0040.B0015) graphed on a logarithmic scale.
In the second graph the arithmetic mean of the sets of geometric means were taken and the standard deviation were plotted for the five devices.
Based on the two graphs it can be shown that the fluorescence in increasing order went as followed: Negative, Device 3, Positive, Device 2, and Device 1. Based on the arithmetic means graph, it can be stated that the measurements were consistent across the biological triplicate with minimal deviations.
