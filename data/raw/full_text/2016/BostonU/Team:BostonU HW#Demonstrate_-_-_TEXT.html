DEMONSTRATION
Come see all that Neptune has to offer at a live demonstration at our booth.
TAKE A LOOK AT NEPTUNE IN ACTION
Below you can find a video of a step by step walkthrough of the Neptune toolchain. We take an example case, Dr. Ali, who wants to create a device to characterize how a genetic part responds to various levels of inducer. We show how he can specify, design, build, and control his microfluidic device through Neptuneâ€™s system:
Step 1
Create a Project!
Step 2
Specify the microfluidic design in terms of liquid flow relations using a library of features provided.
Step 3
Make any parametric edits to chip features if desired in the more detailed MINT description.
Step 4
Build and Assemble the chip and control infrastructure.
Step 5
Control and use the microfluidic system!
