A great iGEM project is so much more than getting an idea and conducting a project. During our time in the iGEM competition we have reached out in order to share our expertise, help other teams in their projects but have also received a helping hand from other supreme iGEM teams and our appreciated sponsors! .

BioBrick Workshop - CosmoCrops & SDU-iGEM
The DTU BioBuilders team 2016 hosted a BioBrick workshop during the spring (May 6th - May 8th) for the other Danish iGEM teams; SDU-iGEM & CosmoCrops (check out their collaboration site - link).
The scope of the workshop was to introduce all three teams to the BioBrick standard, get a feel of working with it in the laboratory and get to know the other Danish iGEM teams. During the weekend we had planned different lectures that all contributed to a better understanding of what is a BioBrick and general getting to know iGEM.
We had our supervisor, Christopher Workman give a judging perspective on the iGEM competition and we discussed the gold medal requirements.  Alumni Pernille Neve Myers and Viktor Hesselberg-Thomsen from DTU BioBuilders 2015 also held a lecture about BioBricks and 3A assembly along with exciting exercises in the laboratory.  The tutorial also had another aspect, namely the design and development of the wiki. Here, we had this years SDU team give us a presentation of general advices for a good wiki and alumni Mads Anderson introduce the “Wiki-wizard”.
Beside having an educational weekend, we also had a lot of fun and got to know the other iGEM teams in Denmark!
The weekend was a great success and gave the Danish teams a great foundation for collaboration and fun during other meetups and during our projects. For more information, please see the below sections.
