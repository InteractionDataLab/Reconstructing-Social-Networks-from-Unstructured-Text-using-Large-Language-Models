                    When assessing growth of microorganisms, it is necessary to be able to obtain and interpret information about population size, or at least concentration at a given time. Optical Density (OD\(_{600}\)) measurement is a widely used, suitable method known by everyone familiar with biotechnology. This principle is based on spectrophotometry, where a light transmission of 600 nm passes through biological material and the resulting transmittance, \(\Phi\), is measured at the receiver end. Because biological material reflects light, higher biological density reflects more light, giving lower transmittance readings. Thus, at full transmittance, \(\Phi_{\text{ref}}\), OD\(_{600}\) should be equal to 0. 
                </P><P>
					For the Microfermentation Platform, OD\(_{600}\) at time <I>t</I> is calculated from the Beer-Lambert law<SUP><A href="#references">1</A>,<A href="#references">2</A>,<A href="#references">3</A>,<A href="#references">4</A></SUP>:

					The sensor recording the transmittance has a maximal saturation level. Transmittance of higher intensity than this level will yield the same constant reading. Thus, the input voltage must be calibrated, such that the emission from the LED matches the maximal saturation level of the sensor exactly when tested under conditions considered as reference.

                This device is meant to go out to fellow iGEMers and Hackerspaces. To validate the assumptions we had when building the prototype, we brought it to our friends from the local hackerspace Biologigaragen and our highschool student Tobias.
            </P><H3 class="h3">Higschool Student: Tobias</H3><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><P>
                            The purpose of this experiment was to test whether the instructions provided in our protocol were sufficient for someone who had never before worked with the device. Tobias volunteered to carry out the experiment. He had the task to compare two different <I>Y. lipolytica</I> strains growing on YPD. He was provided with the robot, all necessary material and the protocol and then left on his own device.
                            </P><P>
                                Tobias had no problems following the protocol we wrote. He found the menu very intuitive and liked the overall design. However, he mentioned that it was difficult to take the cuvettes out again from the robot because the holder is embedded very deeply in the housing. He helped himself by removing a panel and accessing the chambers from the side. A future prototype should be build slightly larger in order to increase comfort. 
                        </P><P>
                                Despite the positive feedback, the experiment failed. This was due to a major flaw in the protocol given to him. It did not include calibration of the airflow. Therefore Tobias left the valve fully open. Most of the liquid was driven out of the cuvettes and spread out inside the housing. It short-circuited several pins of the Arduino, causing the program to crash. Consequently we adapted the protocol and the program so that the airflow could be regulated correctly prior to fermentation.

                He was very positive about the interface and agreed that all the materials used would be available for them.

                    This is a brief overview of the development history. For a chronological order, see the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark/Notebook">notebook</A></P><H3 class="h3">Starting point</H3><FIGURE class="figure"><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption"><B>Figure 13:</B> First experimental set-up</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV id="starterModal" class="modal"><SPAN class="close starter">×</SPAN><DIV class="caption"><B>Figure 13:</B> First experimental set-up</DIV></DIV><P>
                    Together with Docent Erik Vilain Thomsen and Associate professor Martin Dufva, we developed a first prototype. In this version, a single cuvette was stirried with a small magnetic pellet in a black measuring chamber. The light intensity was regulated manualy using a very precise geared potentiometer. The microcontroler received the voltage level from the photodiode, converted it into a 10bit number and send this via USB to the laptop which wrote the output to a file.
                </P><P>
                We learned the following:
                    <UL><LI>The LED remains constant during the whole duration of the experiment, giving constant light output.</LI><LI>The Arduino requires an external power supply larger than 5 V  to supply stable voltages</LI><LI>Magnetic stirring in a cuvette is insufficient</LI></UL></P><P>
                    Martin changed the container to a small glas flask which was giving sufficient stirring and demonstrated that the measuring unit was functional.
                    However, the measuring cell grew even bigger. In order to reach our initial goal, we continued working on our own. We wanted to keep cuvettes as containers because they are cheap and easily available. Also our design needed the following changes
                    <UL><LI>No magnetic stirring</LI><LI>No manually controlled potentiometer</LI><LI>Data logging on µSD-card</LI></UL></P><H3 class="h3">New concepts</H3><P>
                    We could demonstrate that aeriation via common disposable syringes and needles was possible and sufficient to homogenize a <I>S. cerevisiae</I> culture at a tolarable amount of foaming.</P><P>
                    In addition, we managed to replace the potentiometer by a set of low-pass filters combined with the 8bit PMW output-pins of the Arduino. This cut down the cost for the potentiometer and enabled us to use an automatic calibration routine to find the level of saturation for the photodiode.
                    </P><P>
                    We designed our own measuring cell. Compared to Martin's version it has a simpler locking mechanism to hold LEDs and photodiodes in place. It is also much smaler, takes three cuvettes and has connectors for aeration.
                    </P><P>After debugging our circuit on breadboards, we designed printed circuit boards. Ten boards only cost US$ 10, plus shipping.

                    iGEM 2016 is over. We have received both, positive feedback about our creation and many suggestions on how to improve it. We created this prototype with the purpose to share it with hackerspaces, high schools and other iGEM teams world wide. Therefore, we have decided to move the project to github now to have a transparent platform for developments. The  files for the robot we brought to Boston are still linked above as a documentation.

            We have worked very hard this summer to create the robot and achieved something that seemed totally out of reach only a few months ago. This would not have been possible without the help of other people. We would especially like to thank our supervisor Chris, Martin and Erik to get us started in the right direction. To see all credits, pleas go to the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark/Attributions">Attributions</A> page.
