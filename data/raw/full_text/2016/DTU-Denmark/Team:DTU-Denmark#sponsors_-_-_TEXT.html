Associate professor Mhairi Workman helped us during our brainstorm phase with her great expertise in our organism Yarrowia Lipolytica.
Professor Uffe Hasbro Mortensen went through the design of our shuttle vector and generally helped us with the design of our molecular work.
Head of Recruitment and Talent Development Malene Bonne Meyer helped us with all aspects of budget and bureaucracy throughout the entire project.
Graduate Student Researcher Cory Schwartz and Assistant professor Ian Wheeldon kindly sent us our KU70 deficient Yarrowia Lipolytica strain. They also helped us with a transformation protocol and general tips for working with the organism.
Ph.d student Patrice Lubuta and Ph.d student Anders Sebastian Rosenkrans Ødum were present during our brainstorming sessions and gave us great inputs.
Pernille Neve Myers, Viktor Hesselberg-Thomsen and Vilhelm Krarup Møller are all from last years team. They attended some of our general meetings helping us out with getting to know iGEM.
Laboratory Work
Assistant professor Jakob Blæsbjerg Nielsen provided our lab space and gave us great inputs on the use of CRISPR-Cas9.
Postdoc Christina Spuur Nødvig has been a great help during our daily work in the laboratory with her extensive knowledge about molecular work and CRISPR-Cas9.
Postdoc Cristiano Varrano ???
Laboratory Technician Louise has provided help with navigating in the laboratory and has kindly produced the media we needed.
Benchling is a great online tool that enabled us to have an online lab book that the entire team could access simultaneously.
