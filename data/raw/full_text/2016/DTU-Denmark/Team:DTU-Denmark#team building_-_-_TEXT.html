Building a Team
iGEM is more than hard work, learning about synthetic biology and solving the problems of tomorrow. It is about being part of a community and this very unique community begins with each team.
"Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success."

"Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success."
Henry Ford
Being part of an iGEM team is a lot of fun, because you get to be part of a worldwide community, and you get to spend your summer with a group of likeminded people all working towards the same goal. The DTU BioBuilders is a team gathered from different faculties across year groups and nationalities. So to get to know each other and promote the team spirit, we arranged a handful of different social activities outside the office and the lab.
Having Fun with the Group
The whole team gathered one afternoon for a game of the Danish version of softball called "Rundbold."
