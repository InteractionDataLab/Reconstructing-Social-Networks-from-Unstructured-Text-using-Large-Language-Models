                Denmark is a front runner of many innovations. The biotechnology field is no exception and has been offered as a pilot class in Danish high schools since 2008 to get more biological interested students to choose a scientific direction. Even though the pilot scheme has gone well and the trial period has been expanded a couple of times, the law still restricts the possibilities of working with genetically modified organisms. One of the guidelines that the law prescribes is that only plasmids approved by the Danish Ministry for Children, Education and Gender Equality can be used for transformation in Danish high schools and therefore it is time consuming, expensive and difficult for teachers to be innovative in their classes. 
            </P><P> New tools that are easy to use and contribute to a high quality level of education in biotechnology are needed to get more students interested in science so Denmark’s position as an innovative country can remain. 
            </P></DIV><DIV><H2 class="h2">The Idea</H2><DIV class="col-md-6"><P>
                    Last year’s iGEM team from DTU initiated an exciting project that would allow high school students to be innovative in solving national and global problems in medicine, food and environment overcoming the troubles with money, time or the law. The project originates from the BioBrick standard and is called Biosensor. The project is about designing and creating biosensors by choosing a detection gene and a response gene, ligate them and transform it into an approved <I>E. coli</I> strain. The first idea was a simple free exercise for high school students, but the project has developed over the year and now has three elements: a lab kit, a website and competition. 
                </P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6"><FIGURE class="figure"><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption"><B>Figure 1:</B>The general idea of assembling genes as one assembles LEGO® bricks.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV id="LEGOModal" class="modal"><SPAN class="close LEGO">×</SPAN><DIV class="caption">DESCRIPTION</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV><H2 class="h2">The Biosensor Exercise</H2><P>
                    The exercise consists of three parts and a test:
                </P><OL><LI>Digestion of selected genes (2 hours)</LI><LI>Ligation of genes (1 hour) </LI><LI>Transformation of biosensor (3 hours) </LI><LI>Test of biosensors</LI></OL><P>
                    The smart thing about this schedule is that each part takes between 1-3 hours and can be paused by freezing the DNA after each part, so it fits into classes. Examples for biosensors that can be made from the kit:
                </P><OL><LI>A biosensor that can detect when lactose is present and produce lactase to break down the lactose, so lactose intolerant people can drink milk</LI><LI>A biosensor that can detect light, and when no light is detected produce luciferase that makes light </LI><LI>Or just a simple biosensor that can detect mercury in cans with tuna and respond by turning red</LI></OL><P>
                    Like the Danish company LEGO® there are many different combinations and they can solve many different types of problems.

                    The students select the bricks they want to put in the biosensor and add the restriction enzymes to start the digestion. When the digestion is finished a heat inactivation is required in order to proceed to ligation. 
                </P><P><B>Ligation of Genes</B></P><P>
                    After the inactivation, the genes are ready to be ligated together. The ligation is fast and only takes an hour to complete.
                </P><P><B>Transformation of Biosensor</B></P><P>
                    The ligated bricks and plasmid are ready to be put together with competent <I>Escherichia coli</I> cells and be transformed by heat shock. The backbone plasmid contains chloramphenicol resistance and the transformants are therefore plated on LB plates with chloramphenicol. 
                </P><P><B>Test of Biosensor</B></P><P>
                    A day after the transformation is done, the colonies with transformants should be there. It is sometimes necessary to test the biosensor to see if it works as expected, but it depends on the genes in the biosensor.

                    The kit is free for all Danish high schools. The protocol has been worked out together with the subject adviser for biotechnology from the Danish Ministry for Children, Education and Gender Equality, Kresten Cæsar Torp and is approved by the ministry and the Danish Working Environment Authority. The result is that all parts are approved and the teachers do not have to apply for each biosensor the students choose to make.

Sharing and looking at other people’s results is a big part of synthetic biology and the students will learn how important it is to make a good characterization and report. 
                </P><P>
                    The platform will make it possible for teachers and students to communicate and help each other across the country, and it is especially smart when the kit is updated, so protocols are up to date.

                    DTU’s iGEM team will look through the reports and the best biosensors and submit them to the iGEM BioBrick registry. The best biosensor of the year will receive a prize of 5.000 DKK (750 USD). The students also has a possibility of coming up with ideas for a new biosensor. The best idea will also receive a prize of 5.000 DKK (750 USD).

                The biosensors have been tested at our <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark/Collaborations">BioBrick Tutorial</A> and have gone through a couple of changes, but of many tests make a good product. We went to a local high school to do the second test. The test went well and showed that the exercise works! The high schoolers came with feedback on what they liked and what they thought could be improved. They were thrilled that they could pick the genes they wanted to combine themselves. Figure 6 and 7 are from the testing day.

            </P><P>The kits are expected to be ready to be shipped in December. Feedback from the test at Bagsværd Kostskole needs to be implemented and the parts need to be amplified. We hope that the next generation of DTU BioBuilders will continue to develop the project and add new parts as time passes.
