Having and idea and making that idea happen. To watch it expand into something useful, beautiful, practical and lastly, presentable. To handle and overcome the obstacles you meet on that road. Yes, it really thrills me. iGEM is exactly that and more.</P><H5><B>What cheers you up?</B></H5><P>Oh, that’s a long list. I would mention, children and dogs. Children because of their innate, almost unquenchable curiosity, in addition to their appreciation for the even the smallest things. They make us rethink- and re-evaluate our habituated views on things and actions. Dogs are very loyal and excited to see you - specially the dogs serving in law-enforcement. They chase you down as if they are huge fans and I, Justin Bieber - yes, they have us confused a lot</P><H5><B>What did you work on during the project?</B></H5><P> I helped the team by spending the majority of my time in the lab, planning, troubleshooting and excecuting the substrate screening experiments. I networked and facilitated contact with key university faculty and members of industry, condusive for the aim of our project. I applied- and procured samples of waste- and byproducts from several industrial processes in addition to acquiring sponsorships for branded clothing, bags and accessories for our team. ThenI also had the privilege of pitching our project in the &quot;Green challenge&quot; competition (DTU) and at the &quot;iGEM European Experience&quot;-event in Paris (IONIS).
