1. Introduction
This section describes the evaluation of the module of Quorum Sensing. Snow White seems to die after eating the Poisoned Apple that was given by Queen. In order to trace this scene with E. coli, establishing cell-cell communication is necessary.
AHLs, which stand for [N-]acyl-homoserine lactones, are small signaling molecules and are employed in the bacterial “Quorum Sensing” system. In our project, we decided to use three AHLs studied well by several preceding iGEM Teams; the AHL molecules used here were C4HSL (hereafter referred to as C4), 3OC6HSL (C6), and 3OC12HSL (C12). Using these molecules, we enable the E. coli cells in a test tube to communicate and interact. By the experiments in this section, the module of Quorum Sensing was evaluated.
2. Summary of the experiment
The purpose of the experiments in this section is to evaluate the activities of Prhl ( BBa_I14017 ), Plux ( BBa_R0062 ), and Plas ( BBa_R0079 ) promoters upon addition of different AHLs. When C4, C6, and C12 internalize into E. coli cells, these molecules are accepted by the corresponding receptor proteins, RhlR, LuxR, and LasR, respectively. Then, the RhlR-C4, LuxR-C6, and LasR-C12 complexes activate/repress transcription from the Prhl, Plux, and Plas, respectively. However, it should be considered that illegitimate reactions of an AHL to non-native receptor proteins also occur to some extent. This phenomenon is called 'crosstalk.' We wanted to seek the best combination of AHL systems for a co-culture of Snow White coli and Queen coli. To this end, four plasmids shown below were constructed and the Relative Fluorescent Units (RFU) of GFP / Turbidity after adding each AHL to the culture medium was measured.

3. Results
The experiments proved that our parts worked as expected (Fig.3-2-1-3).
The ratio of promoter strength is shown below.
Prhl( BBa_I14017 ) : Plux( BBa_R0062 ) : Plas( BBa_R0079 )= 2 : 40 :1
The Lux system, which is usually activated by C6, reacted not only to C6 but also to C12 (crosstalk). The reaction rate to C12 was half as that to C6. The Rhl system, which is usually activated by C4, reacted not only to C4 but also to C6 (crosstalk). The reaction rate to C6 was 0.78-fold relative to that to C4.
Fig. 3-2-1-3 RFU of GFP / Turbidity of AHL Reporter Assay
We measured RFU of GFP / Turbidity with  Rhl Reporter by using the plasimid-A, Lux Reporter by using the plasmid-B, and Las Reporter by using the plasmid-C. The vertical scale is calculated by subtracting the value in Negative control (plasmid-D) from the values that we got from each sample.
4. Discussion
Considering different expression level from the AHL-inducible promoters shown above, we should find and choose the appropriate combination of the AHL molecules, the receptor proteins, and the AHL-inducible promoters for our final genetic circuits. The above results implied that, for expression induction from Plux( BBa_R0062 ), using not C6 but C12 was better to orchestrate the promoter activities. However, the promoter activity of Prhl( BBa_I14017 ) was still estimated to be incomparable to that of Plux( BBa_R0062 ). In fact, when our final circuits was simulated, it was found that the Prhl( BBa_I14017 ) activity was too weak compared to Plux( BBa_R0062 ) to operate our final circuits successfully (read the Model page ). Taken together, we concluded that improvement of Prhl( BBa_R0071 ) was necessary to increase its promoter activity and orchestrate the promoter activities (read the Rhl system assay page ).
5. Materials and methods
5-1. Construction
-Strain
All the plasmids were prepared in XL1‐Blue strain.
-Medium
LB medium A:
LB medium containing ampicillin (50 microg/ mL)
5-2. Assay protocol
The following experiments are performed at 37˚C unless otherwise stated.
1) Prepare overnight cultures for each sample in 3 mL LB medium A with vigorous shaking.
2) Dilute the overnight cultures to 1 / 60 in fresh LB medium A (1.2 mL).
3) Incubate the fresh cultures for 1 h with vigorous shaking.
4) Add 500 microM C4, 500 microM C6, 500 microM C12 or DMSO to each 500 microL sample at the final concentration 10 microM.
5) Incubate the samples for 4 h with vigorous shaking.
6) Add 100 microL of the samples to each well of a plate reader.
7) Measure RFU of GFP  at 490 nm as an excitation wavelength, 525 nm as an emission wavelength.
8) Measure the turbidity at 600 nm.
