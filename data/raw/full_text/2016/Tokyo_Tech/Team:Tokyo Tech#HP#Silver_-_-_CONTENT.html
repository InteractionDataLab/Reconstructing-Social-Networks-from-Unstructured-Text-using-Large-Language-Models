Finally, we have managed to give the classes to 269 middle and high school students of 6 schools. Furthermore, these activities were good opportunities for us to know how our project impacted on the general public. The details are organized for each school so that anyone can do these kind of lessons in the future.

Some elements are common in any Snow White stories. However, because authors add their original elements or features to the story, it becomes unique.
