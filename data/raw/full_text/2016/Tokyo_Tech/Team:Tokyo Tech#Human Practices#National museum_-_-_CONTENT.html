Recently, some iGEM teams used media such as SNS or vide sites in attempt to let more people know about synthetic biology. Though these energetic activities, misunderstandings about synthetic biology remains. We thought its reason was the way of communicating. So, we decided to dialogue with Mr. Ogawa, who is a the science communicator, as well as athe professional of communicating science to public. He taught us the important lessons of communicating science or studies to public. The lessons are shown below.

We should determine what the public want to know and where they have an interest in. And based on the results, it is necessary to change the outgoing method of our project accordingly. In fact, through the communication with the general public, we found that there exist a general interest in the utility of TA system (see Nishi high school page). It is considered to be the opportunity to let the general public to get to know TA system by presenting our proposals of it is future utility . In addition, in terms of getting more people to know the TA system, the increasing number of professional description in the explanation of TA system is inevitable. Thus we used the familiar story of &quot;Snow White&quot; to help the general public to understand.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="conclusion" class="container"><DIV id="conclusion_header" class="container_header"><H2><SPAN>4.
