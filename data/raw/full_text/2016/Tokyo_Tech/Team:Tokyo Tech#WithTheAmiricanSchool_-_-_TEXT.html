Team:Tokyo Tech/WithTheAmiricanSchool
Helping new school
We visited The American School in Japan on September 14th and gave a modeling lecture. We explained our projectâ€™s overview and taught modeling methods. We also talked about what iGEM is because The American School is a new iGEM team. The iGEM Tokyo Tech team had collaborated with many universities so far. This visit enabled us to collaborate with high school.
