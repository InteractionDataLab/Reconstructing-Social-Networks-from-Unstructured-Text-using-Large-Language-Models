1. Introduction
Our final genetic circuits are combined TA system and Quorum Sensing (Fig.3-2-3-1). Constructing complicated circuits needs assays divided into each part. This assay is about a part of Quorum Sensing and focused on production and reception of AHL to express the communication between Snow White coli and Queen coli.

2. Summary of the Experiment
Our purpose is to confirm the circuits working as a reporter and a sender to specific AHL. Add (a) C4 into Queen-like coli, (b) C4 into co-culture of Queen-like coli and Sow White-like coli. Then measure the RFU of GFP and RFU of RFP. The results indicate that Prhl strength is so low that our final genetic circuits cannot work with normal Prhl.
3. Results
RFU of GFP/ Turbidity was almost same in spite of adding C4 or DMSO into Queen-like or co-culture (Fig.3-2-2-3). The leak of Prhl was high and its cause noticed at Rhl System Assay page.

4. Discussion
The expression level of Prhl was so weak and the leak was high that Queen-like coli could not influence to Snow White-like coli, in other words, our final genetic circuits could not work. Taken together the results below, we have to improve Prhl strength to work our final circuits.

-Medium
LB medium AK
LB medium containing ampicillin (50 microg/ mL) and kanamycin (50 microg/ mL)
5-2. Assay Protocol
The following experiments is performed at 37℃ unless otherwise stated.
1) Prepare the overnight cultures in LB medium AK at 180 rpm.
2) Dilute the overnight cultures to 1/60 in fresh LB medium AK at 700 rpm for 1 h.
3) Add C4 (100 microM) into Queen-like coli and C12 into Snow White-like coli, and incubate them at 700 rpm for 4 h.
4) Measure the fluorescence intensity of GFP at 490nm as an exciting wavelength, 525nm as a measurement wavelength.
