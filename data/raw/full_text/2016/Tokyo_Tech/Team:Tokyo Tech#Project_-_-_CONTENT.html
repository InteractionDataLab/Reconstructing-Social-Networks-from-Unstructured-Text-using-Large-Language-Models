Toxins are proteins, whereas antitoxins are either proteins or non-coding RNAs. Many prokaryotes harbor toxin-antitoxin systems on the genomes, typically in multiple copies. Changes in the physiological conditions, such as stress conditions or viral infection trigger antitoxin degradation by cytosolic proteases. Unleashed toxin proteins impede or alter cellular processes including translation, cell division, DNA replication, ATP synthesis, mRNA stability, or cell wall synthesis and lead to dormancy. This dormant state probably enables bacteria to survive in unfavorable conditions. In general, toxin proteins are more stable than antitoxin proteins, but antitoxins are expressed at a higher level in cells.
</P><DIV align="center"><P class="normal_text">First toxin‐antitoxin: MazF / MazE</P></DIV><P class="normal_text">MazF is a toxin protein, and MazE is its cognate antitoxin protein. MazF is a ribosome-independent endoribonuclease whose activity leads to bacterial growth arrest. MazE and MazF form homodimers, and MazF dimer cleaves mRNAs at ACA sequences. One MazE dimer binds to two MazF dimers, thereby inactivating endoribonuclease activity of MazF dimer. MazE is labile andis subjected to degradation by ClpAP protease, whereas MazF is more stable. </P><DIV align="center"><P class="caption" style="font-size: 16px; text-align: center;"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 2-3-1-1.

As a result of simulation, we obtained and confirmed the desirable behavior of the whole system by modifying and improving parts. As described below, our simulation showed appropriate transition of fluorescence for the story.

Based on the simulation, we will show you which one is a real beauty, Snow White <SPAN style="font-style : italic">coli</SPAN> or the Queen <SPAN style="font-style : italic">coli</SPAN>.<P class="normal_text"> In the blue area of Fig.5-2-2, the concentration of fluorescent proteins start to increase. The concentration of RFP of Snow White <SPAN style="font-style : italic">coli</SPAN> exceeds  that of GFP of the Queen <SPAN style="font-style : italic">coli</SPAN>. 
     It is as if Snow White got fairer more and more.

     In the pink area of Fig.5-2-2, the concentration of C12 increase thanks to the appearance of C4. As a result, the MazF inside Snow White <SPAN style="font-style : italic">coli</SPAN> and the Queen <SPAN style="font-style : italic">coli</SPAN> start to suppress the increment of fluorescet proteins. 
     It is as if the Queen, influenced by the Mirror's answer, transforming into a Witch in order to give Snow White a poisoned apple.

     In the green area of Fig.5-2-2, the concentration of C12 more increases and the MazF inside Snow White <SPAN style="font-style : italic">coli</SPAN> more suppress the increment of GFP. So the concentration GFP exceeds that of RFP. 
     It looks as if Snow White bit the apple, sinking into unconsciousness soon.

     In the yellow area of Fig.5-2-2, the AmiE synthesized by the introduced Prince <SPAN style="font-style : italic">coli</SPAN> decomposes C12 so the MazF inside Snow White <SPAN style="font-style : italic">coli</SPAN> diminishes and the concentration of GFP resumes. 
     It looks as if the Prince lifted Snow White and she opened her eyes.

However, we got the simple question from junior high school and high school students that why other characters did not appear in our story. Then we decided to add other characters. We designed the Magic Mirror’s genetic circuit and conducted an experiment. Additionally, as dwarfs, we prepared the <SPAN style="font-style : italic">E. coli</SPAN> (strain name). As you can see in the photograph, they have round shapes and are very charming compared to the general <SPAN style="font-style : italic">E. coli</SPAN>. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="sof_header"><H3><SPAN>6.3.

However, at present, there exits problems when using a TA system to control the protein production.</P><P class="normal_text">We cannot selectively produce only desired protein because other proteins would be also produced at the same time.
Then, our dry lab used Java to develop software named “ACA Dwarfs” adjusting number of ACA base sequence as a solution to the problem.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="reference" class="container"><DIV id="reference_header" class="container_header"><H2><SPAN>7.
