1. Introduction
This section is an extension of the previous section (3-2-1 AHL reporter assay), and the point of Quorum Sensing was further evaluated. Specifically, production of AHLs and AHL-mediated communication between the Snow White coli and Queen coli were analyzed.

2. Summary of the experiment
The reporter (Queen-like coli and Snow White-like coli) and sender (Queen-like coli) E. coli cells were prepared which carried rhlR and luxR genes, respectively. Then,(a) C4 was added into Queen-like coli, and (b) C4 was added into a co-culture of Queen-like coli and Snow White-like coli. The Relative Fluorescent Units (RFU) of GFP was measured. The results indicated that Prhl( BBa_I14017) activity was so low that our final genetic circuits would not work with this Prhl.( BBa_I14017 )

3. Results
RFU of GFP / Turbidity was almost the same though adding C4 or DMSO to Queen-like coli or the co-culture (Fig.3-2-2-3). The leak of Prhl( BBa_I14017 ) was high and the cause is explained Rhl system assay page .
Fig. 3-2-2-3 RFU of GFP / Turbidity of Only Assay
We measured RFU of GFP / Turbidity with  Queen-like coli by using the plasimid-A and Co-culture by using the plasmid-B. The vertical scale is calculated by subtracting the value in Negative control (plasmid-C) from the values that we got from each sample.
4. Discussion
The expression level of Prhl( BBa_I14017 ) was so weak and the leak was so high that Queen-like coli could not influence Snow White-like coli ; in other words, our final genetic circuits seemed not to work. Taken together the results, we again recognized that we have to improve Prhl activity to operate our final circuits.
5. Materials and methods
5-1. Construction
-Strain
All the plasmids were prepared in XL1-Blue strain.
-Medium
LB medium AK:
LB medium containing ampicillin (50 microg/ mL) and kanamycin (50 microg/ mL)
5-2. Assay protocol
The following experiments are performed at 37℃ unless otherwise stated.
1) Prepare the overnight cultures in LB medium AK with vigorous shaking.
2) Dilute the overnight cultures to 1 / 60 in fresh LB medium AK with vigorous shaking for 1 h.
3) Add C4 (100 microM) to Queen-like coli and C12 to Snow White-like coli, and incubate them with vigorous shaking for 4 h.
4) Measure RFU of GFP at 490nm as an excitation wavelength, 525nm as an emission wavelength.
