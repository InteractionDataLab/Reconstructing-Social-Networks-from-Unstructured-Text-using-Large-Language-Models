We experimentally confirmed that <A href=" https://2016.igem.org/Team:Tokyo_Tech/Toxin_Assay/mazEF_System_Assay#GaS">MazF inhibited translation through cleavage of mRNAs</A> and <A href=" https://2016.igem.org/Team:Tokyo_Tech/Toxin_Assay/mazEF_System_Assay#SaG">MazE let translation “resuscitate” from this inhibition</A>. Also, we theoretically confirmed the feasibility of a desired behavior by <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Tokyo_Tech/Model#requirements">modeling</A>.
				Our system has expanded the regulation of protein expression to <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Tokyo_Tech/Toxin_Assay/mazEF_System_Assay#2.results">the mRNA level</A>, while the conventional regulation has mainly targeted ribosome machinery. Furthermore, we succeeded in changing the inhibition efficiency by designing the DNA sequence without changing the protein sequence by <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Tokyo_Tech/Model#software">our new software</A>. Therefore, we made it possible to design more various systems by combining the <SPAN style="font-style : italic">mazEF</SPAN> system and a variety of inducible promoters.
