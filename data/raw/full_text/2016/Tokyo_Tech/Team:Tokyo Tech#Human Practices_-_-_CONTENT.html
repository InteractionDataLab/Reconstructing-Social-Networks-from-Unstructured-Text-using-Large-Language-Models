In order to solve these issues, we chose to show our concepts through Snow White, one of the most famous stories around the world. Besides, we held many outreach activities,   dialogued with experts, and created a model called &quot;3E&quot;: education, ethics, and economy. We also designed some ideas based to our research (Toxin-Antitoxin system etc.) for society. 
We contributed to raising public awareness of synthetic biology and improving our project through science communication.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="3E" class="container"><DIV id="3E_header" class="container_header"><H1><SPAN>2. 3E</SPAN></H1></DIV><DIV id="3E_contents" class="container_contents"><P class="normal_text">We approach the social meaning of our project from three aspects: Education, Ethics, and Economy.

Especially synthetic biology, there are a lot of problems in this field. The judge about the boundary between the research allowed and the research restricted is extremely difficult. However, as researchers of life science, iGEM 2016 team Tokyo_Tech must take into account the problems arising deeply. In this case, we organized a symposium where we can discuss with the experts and exchange opinions with them. Moreover, we start to think about our ethic code of synthetic biology, basing on the things we learned from this symposium.</P><P style="text-align: center;" class="normal_text">[<A href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="show('ethics_hide'); return false;" class="showHidden">Read More</A>]</P></DIV><DIV id="ethics_hide" class="off"><DIV id="ethics_symposium" class="3e_contents"><H3 class="3e_contents_header">Symposium</H3><P class="normal_text">We discussed with 6 researchers who is working on synthetic biology in this symposium.

We have interests in this thing , so when we think about ethic code, we make it based on this.</P><P class="normal_text">Firstly, the reason why the ethic of technology and the one of science are different is because the goals of studies are different. The goal of debeloping technology is mainly application in the society, as a result, it is necessary to include appropriateness of method, usability, security and management of risk. On the other hand, researcher do the scientific studies due to the spirit of inquiry, therefore, it is necessary to include appropriateness and completely mutual criticism among researchers. We aim to make our project be applied to developing technology which is usable to society, therefore, we think about our ethic code referencing the ethic of technology. However, thinking about the ethic directly is difficult, so at the first step, we want to think about ethic related to what kind of problems in our project.</P></DIV><DIV id="ethics_iGEM_Tokyo_Tech2016’s ethic problem" class="3e_contents"><H3 class="3e_contents_header">iGEM_Tokyo_Tech2016's ethic problem</H3><P class="normal_text">As what we said in Future work, we are thinking that whether TA system can be applied to DDS and to decreasing risk of mutidrug-resistant bacteria appearing .

For example, the boundary of living and non living creature depends on species. Moreover, there are always different opinions because of culture and religon. All the things above are the reason making ethic problems become complicated. </P><P class="normal_text">On the other hand, as reality, ordinary people tend to think towards questions that it is scientist who should take into account theses problems, and have nothing to do with the problems. In order to change the way they are thinking, it is important to have the opportunities that we can get information from scientists in symposium and lectures given to high school students. We need to let ordinary people know that ethic problems do have relation with them, which is also merit for scientists. when we were giving the lecture to high school students, we know something new through the conversation among ordinary people, which is different when we talk with scientists. Everyone can feel the ethic problems closing to their daily life through thinking about what kind of questions will happen and discussing with each other. Moreover, by popularizing this, there is a goal that all the actions taken are right after thinking about life ethic.</P></DIV><DIV id="ethics_referance" class="3e_contents"><H3 class="3e_contents_header">Reference

Discussion</H3><P class="normal_text">In conclusion, we proved that the genes of other bacterial QS and temperature-dependent promoters worked in <I>E. coli</I> and that <I>E. coli</I> original TA system gene under inducible promoters regulated the growth in WET experiments. From these results, the simulation showed that <I>E. coli</I> containing TA system gene and QS gene under various inducible promoters communicated with each other. 
 Besides, by simulating that the genetic circuits worked properly with the three types of inducible promoters, we suggest that intestinal bacterial growth is controlled by nutritional condition, temperature and intestinal bacterial density. The three types of promoters were the sugar-dependent promoters (PBAD, Plac), the temperature-dependent promoters (Pcold, Pheat) and the AHL-dependent promoters (Prhl, Plux and Plas).
 Our project therefore helps to understand the symbiosis of intestinal flora. Furthermore, we are quite sure that we could engineer the <I>E. coli</I> or other bacteria which have function of regulating the symbiosis.</P></DIV></LI></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV id="Policy_and_Practices" class="container"><DIV id="policy_and_practice_header" class="container_header"><H1><SPAN>3.

As we figured out even though contents of Snow White project are difficult to understand, the public still showed great interest in it because it brought a sense of familiarity to the most. And this obviously leads to the public's deeper understanding of Snow White project than the others. Thus, we selected Snow White as our project.</P></DIV><DIV id="school_visits"><P class="normal_text">Then, in the classes we gave to high school students, we were asked the reason why there are only three characters in the story. Accordingly, we found suitable characters and environmental factors to add into the story.</P></DIV><DIV id="dialog"><P class="normal_text">Another question from the students is that representing the story is interesting, but how our project can contribute to the society. Because this comment actually inspired us a lot, we started to focus on the consideration of the prospect of our project. After having dialogue with experts, we obtained a comment that TA system has a potential to be linked to development of effective technology. However, at present, there exits problems when using a TA system to control the protein production. We cannot selectively produce only desired protein because other proteins would be also produced at the same time. Then, our dry lab used JAVA to develop software named &quot;ACADwarfs&quot; adjusting number of ACA base sequence as a solution to the problem.

Some elements are common in any Snow White stories. However, because the authors add their original elements or features to the story, it becomes unique.
