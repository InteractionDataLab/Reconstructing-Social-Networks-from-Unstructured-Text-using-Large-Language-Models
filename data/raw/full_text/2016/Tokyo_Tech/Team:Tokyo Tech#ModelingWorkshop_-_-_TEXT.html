Team:Tokyo Tech/ModelingWorkshop
A workshop of modeling
On August 16th, we hosted a workshop of dry teams. The participating universities were Gifu University, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, University of Tokyo and Kanazawa Institute of Technology. The iGEM Tokyo Tech team and the iGEM UT-Tokyo team taught modeling methods to the other iGEM teams. We exchanged our ideas, and thereby we gained new knowledge of modeling.
