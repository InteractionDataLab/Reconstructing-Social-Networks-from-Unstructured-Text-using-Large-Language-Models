Education
School-visits
In order to provide more people in general with a more accurate information about E. coli, gene reconfiguration, and synthetic biology, we planed to conduct some School-visits. Finally, we have managed to give the classes to 269 middle and high school students of 6 schools. Furthermore, these activities were good opportunities for us to know how our project impacted on the general public. The details are organized for each school so that anyone can do these kind of lessons in the future. Please feel free to use these as reference.
Video
Because the public could not understand our activities well, we made intelligible videos to improve this situation. The videos are delivering over YouTube.
Card Game
We made the card game for the public to understand the basis of our project, TA system and Quorum Sensing.
An Expert
We noticed that ways of manifesting and expressing our project are important when we explain our project to the public. An expert gave us the advice that we should insert something extremely impressive for the public to summarize our project in accordance to audience’s satisfaction.
Ethics
Symposium
We hosted a symposium providing an opportunity for students to think about synthetic biology.
Code of ethics
Based on the symposium, we have developed our original code of ethics.
Economy
Dialogue with an expert
Through developing ideas aroused from dialogue with an expert, we have created “TA system ~Queen’s Caprice~” and “ACADwarfs.” Furthermore, getting a hint from it, we have made experiments of E. coli mutants secreting proteins extracellularly. In order to realize more efficient control of protein synthesis, this is an approach of our human practice activities from a perspective of economy.
Snow White Versions
The remaking of fairy tale “Snow White” by the Brothers Grimm has enjoyed a lot of versions since it was published in 1812 in the first edition of their collection Grimms’ Fairy Tales. Some elements are common in any Snow White stories. However, because authors add their original elements or features to the story, it becomes unique. We chose other two versions, “Mirror Mirror” and “A Snow White Christmas” and designed their genetic circuits as follow.
