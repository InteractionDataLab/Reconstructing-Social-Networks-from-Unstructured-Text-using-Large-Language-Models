And this obviously lead to the public's deeper understanding of Snow White project than the others. Thus we determined our project as Snow White.</P></DIV><DIV id="school_visits"><P class="normal_text">Then in the lessons we gave to the high school students, we were asked that why there are only three characters in the story. Accordingly, we found suitable characters and environmental factors to add into the story. </P></DIV><DIV id="dialog"><P class="normal_text">Another question from the students is that representing the story is interesting, but how our project can contribute to the society. This actually inspired us a lot for we started to focus on the consideration of the prospect of our project.</P></DIV><P class="normal_text"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">After having dialogue with expert,</SPAN> we obtained the comment that TA system has the potential to be linked to the development of effective technology.</P><P class="normal_text">However, at present there exit problems when using a TA system to control the protein production.
We cannot selectively produce only desired protein, because other proteins also would be produced at the same time.</P><P class="normal_text"><SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">Then</SPAN> our dry lab used Java to reseach into the development of ACA base sequence's number adjustable software which we call it &quot;ACA Dwarfs&quot; as a solution to the problem.</P></DIV><DIV class="container_contents"><P class="normal_text"> </P><P class="normal_text">In this way, we integrated Human Practices to out project.

&quot;Don't other characters appear in the story?&quot;
</P></DIV><DIV class="practice_left practices practices_contents"><P class="integrated_human_header">At the beginning, the characters were three: Snow White, the Queen and the Prince.

(ii), Repetition of protein production control leads to sustainable production in one system.
