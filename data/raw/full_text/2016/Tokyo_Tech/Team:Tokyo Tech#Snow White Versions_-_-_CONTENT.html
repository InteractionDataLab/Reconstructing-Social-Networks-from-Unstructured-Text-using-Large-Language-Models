Overview</SPAN></H2></DIV><DIV id="overview_contents" class="container_contents"><P class="normal_text">The remaking of fairy tale “Snow White” by the Brothers Grimm has enjoyed a lot of variations since it was published in 1812 in the first edition of their collection Grimms’ Fairy Tales. In 1973 the Walt Disney made “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” as their first colored animated film. 
Why was Snow White remade again and again, and are there many varieties of Snow White? Some elements are common in any Snow White stories. However, because authors add their original elements or features to the story, it becomes unique. Each version reflects on its historical background or cultures. We chose other two versions, “Mirror Mirror” and “A Snow White Christmas” and designed their genetic circuits. The two stories and their genetic circuits are shown below.

Snow White and the King have a young daughter, also named Snow White for her snow-white hair. One day an ice block encasing the Wickes Queen melts and she is freed.
Returning to her castle, she finds her Magic Mirror and asks it who is the fairest. When it replies that there are two who are equally fair, the witch accuses it of taking the coward's way in saying that she and Snow White are equally beautiful. The furious Queen creates a magical ice storm and freezes the entire kingdom, just missing the horrified princess Snow White. Snow White can escape into the forest with Grunyon’s help and encounters the seven Giants. 
After the Wicked Queen discovers the young Snow White is still alive, she tries to kill the princess Snow but she fails. The Queen finally turns two vultures into wyvern-like creatures to distract Hicker, then disguises herself as a Giant old woman and tricks Snow White into smelling the scent of a poisoned flower that puts her to sleep, just as she tricked Snow White's mother with the poisoned apple. Seeing Snow White apparently dead, the Giants run off to attack the Queen's castle. The Queen fails to stop them and the Queen’s castle collapses. The Magic Mirror, revealed as the source of her power, is shattered and the demons vanish as the Queen herself evaporates into nothingness.
With the Wicked Queen's demise, the curse she has placed over the kingdom is broken, causing the ice statues to revert to people, King Charming and Snow White. Grunyon and the Giants bring young Snow White home to her parents in a rose-filled coffin. They kiss Snow White's cheeks and she awakens, and everyone rejoices.
