Parts
Every year, more and more parts are being added to the registry by iGEM teams all over the  world.           We understand the importance of constructing new parts, but even more important high quality parts. Each of our submitted parts was tested in the lab and well documented.           The submitted parts were carefully chosen as parts that can be useful and easy to use for           future iGEM teams.
The table below presents all parts submitted to the iGEM Registry. Information about           the applications and characterization of each part can be seen in the biobrick pages of           the registry.
This is the full list of our parts:
