Best new basic part candidate
We chose PctA-Tar hybrid as our best new basic part. This part serves as the proof of                                          concept, in the LBD replacing strategy for our S.Tar platform. PctA is a chemoreceptor                                          found in the bacterium P. Aeruginosa which mediates chemotaxis toward amino acids and                                          away from organic compounds. The PctA-Tar hybrid was conducted previously in the literature,                                          and tested for chemotaxis response to attractants, but not to repellents. Our experiments                                          show that the hybrid receptor sensitive to the PctA repellent, organic components. This                                          property is influential, and can be used in various applications, including detection of                                          polluted water.  To learn more, please check our Proof of concept page and the PctA part                                          , K1992001 , in the registry.
