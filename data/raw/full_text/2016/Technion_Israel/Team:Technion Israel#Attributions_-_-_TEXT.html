S.tar, by iGEM Technion 2016
Throughout the work on our project we learned that iGEM is not all about science, but also about the people  behind it. We would like to thank the people, who without their help we would not have reached our goals.
Advisors
We would like to thank our advisors who guided us and consulted us throughout the year. We are thankful  for the opportunity to work with them and we deeply appreciate their effort to promote our project.
We want to thank our:
Primary PI: Prof. Roee Amit
Secondary PI: Dr. Orna Atar
Instructors:
Alex Ereskovsky
Beate Kaufmann
Noa Katz
Michal Meirom
Special thanks go to the people from Prof. Roee Amit’s lab, who were there for us to give advises and to support us scientifically, but mentally as well.
We want to thank to:
Dr. Sarah Goldberg for her generous guidance and assistance, especially with microscopy.
Alexey Tomsov for sharing with us his past iGEM experience, especially for giving us advices to improve our presentation and poster and for helping us with parts submission.
Scientific Support
We would like to express our gratitude to all the researchers that assisted us and provided their scientific  knowledge. It was a pleasure to work with leading scientists and we were honored to have the opportunity  to learn so much from them.
We would like to thank:
Dr. Moriah Koler , from Dr. Adi Vaknin’s lab at the Hebrew  University in Jerusalem, for providing us with various strains and plasmids and for her generous scientific assistance.
Einat Tamar, from Roy Kishoni's lab at the Technion, for enriching us with her scientific knowledge about Chemotaxis.
Prof. Moran Bercovici , for his generous assistance with the modeling of   flow and diffusion profiles.
Prof. Ester Segal , for guiding us with the chip design and for allowing  us to use her lab and equipment for our chemotaxis assays.
Dr. Nadav Ben-Dov, Yuri Haimov and Heidi Leonard,  from Prof. Ester Segal's lab at the Technion, for guiding us through  the operation of the Trap & Track system and for tutoring us in molding PDMS chips.
Prof. Michael Eisenbach and Oshri Afanzar,  from the Weizmann Institute of Science, for contributing protocols and for helping with the design of chemotaxis assays,  both microscope and plate based ones.
Jonathan Avesar, from Prof. Shulamit Levenberg's lab at the Technion, for assisting us with the chip design.
Post-Doctoral Fellow Rocco Moretti, from Prof. Jen Meiler's lab at the University of Vanderbilt in Tennessee,  for helping us with the operation of the Rosetta software and the design of new ligand binding sites.
Prof. Meytal Landau , for providing advices regarding protein visualization.
Dr. Fabian Glaser ,  for assisting us with the homology modeling paper.
Prof. Roy Kishony , for helping us with the  numerical solution for the model.
Prof. Amit Meller , for assisting us with the design of  a quantitative system for the chip.
Zvi Hantsis, for helping us with developing the numerical model.
David cohen, for the installation of the  Rosetta software on the “Atlas” server and for providing technical support.
General Support
We would like to thank all the people who helped us with promoting our project:
Prof. David (Dedi) Meiri, Prof. Meytal Landau and Prof. Avraham Haim, for honoring us with their presence and  for lecturing for us on the “Science on The Bar” nights we conducted.
Dr. Orit Goldenberg, the scientific consultant of the kindergartens of science, for helping us to construct an educational program.
Hagit Kamin, CEO of eco 99fm radio station, for inspiring us and provided us with ideas for how to brand our project.
Roy Ben Arie , for helping us with graphic design and photography.
Sharon Kestenboum and Shahar Reinis, for helping us with the marketing and branding aspects of the project.
Financial Support
We are thankful for the generous support of the companies which provided us with the essential lab equipment and materials as seen below.
