S.tar, by iGEM Technion 2016
Register for iGEM ,              have a great summer
and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Complete the Judging form .
Attributions
Part & Contribution - We have submitted 12 parts. You can check our BioBrick page .
Validated Part / Validated Contribution -
we have validated all of our twelve parts!
Collaboration - we collaborated with four iGEM teams.
Human Practices
Improve a previous part or project              - we have improved a previous BioBrick part K777001 and characterized a previous BioBrick part K777000 .              You can check our improvement page .
Proof of concept - we tested and validated two of our new designed chemoreceptors               as a Proof of Concept .
Achievements
Successfully designed a novel functional Tar chemoreceptor , that can           detect Histamine instead of Aspartate, using the Rosetta bioinformatics software.
Demonstrated working concept of the FlashLab project with our engineered          bacteria PctA-Tar and Histamine variant.
Using Rosetta, built a platform for designing           novel two component system receptors.
Wrote a “How to use” guide for the Rosetta software, with Rosetta developers and iGEM TU Eindhoven team.
Developed and tested a new chemotaxis Measurement method .
Designed and produced FlashLab - new fluidic chip.
Successfully constructed 12 new Biobricks!
