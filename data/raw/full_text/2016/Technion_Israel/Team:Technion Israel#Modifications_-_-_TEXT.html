Tar-modification introduction
We have created non-natural chemoreceptors by modifying Tar’s ligand binding domain.
The main goal of project S.Tar was to design new chemoreceptors that do not           exist in nature. These new chemoreceptors were based on the Tar chemoreceptor.
Said chemoreceptor structure consists of three main regions: Ligand binding           domain (LBD), The HAMP domain and the MH bundle (1)
Fig. 1: Tar chemoreceptor structure.
Our project focused on altering the LBD region by using different tools and approaches           each designed to achieve a unique response. The three major approaches were as follows:
1. Tar-Chimeras: a hybrid receptor consisting of an LBD from different sources,             such as human and other bacteria, fused to the HAMP and MH of Tar. An example of these             hybrids: PctA-Tar and Narx-Tar.
2. Intein: A protein fused into the LBD that functions as an on/off mechanism that             allows the control of chemotaxis.
3. Rosseta: a computer software that helps with the design of new LBDs that             recognizes the ligand of your choice.
