S.Tar, by iGEM Technion 2016
In the last century science has taken an enormous leap from an occupation           solely limited to the academic community to something that a large part           of the population is exposed to in all aspects of life, from school through           social media and TV to our supermarkets. This exposure, while highly beneficial           to the progress of scientific research, can also lead to high amounts of           misinformation and fear in the public due to unawareness. As researchers           we see the importance of education and an open dialog on the benefits of science as a           tool to combat these issues.
Meeting with Nobel Prize winner Prof. Dan Shechtman.
In our human practice project we focused on two parts.          First we contacted a famous Israeli podcaster           to discuss on synthetic biology on his show. Secondly, we took part in a variety of educational activities for           different demographics: from kindergarten students to elderly citizens.
