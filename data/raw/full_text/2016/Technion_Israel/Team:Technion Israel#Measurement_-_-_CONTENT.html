										Although there is an abundant number of chemotaxis assays available today, most of them 
										were designed 40 to 50 years ago and almost none provide a real time measurement without 
										the use of fluorescence labeling <B>(1)</B>.
										The use of Porous Si (PSi) and oxidized PSi (PSiO2) matrices for biological sensing is on 
										the rise. So far various analytes such as DNA, proteins and bacteria have been proven to 
										be detectable on such matrices. The common method to monitor the interaction of said analytes 
										within the porous films is reflective interferometric Fourier transform spectroscopy (RIFTS), 
										as it allows a real time measurement and output for the user <B>(2,3)</B>.

										for monitoring molecular interactions in porous Silicon films. The measurement begins by shining 
										a beam of white light on the film. The porous Silicon acts as a grating that scatters the light 
										and creates a set of diffraction orders at different angles, depending on the periodicity of the 
										pores. The reflected light beam is measured by a spectrometer. Detection is based on changes 
										in the spectral interference pattern which results from the reflection of the beam.

										Molecules that penetrate into the silicon pores are observed as a change in the 
										refractive index of the zero-order diffraction - the reflected light which is 
										normal to the pores’ surface.
									</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"><P class="text-justify">
										The intensity of the reflected light is given by the expression:

									I is the intensity of the light, Ψ is the phase delay between the 
									source beam and the reflected one, λ is the free space optical 
									wavelength, L is the depth of the pores (a physical property of the 
									Silicon film) and n0 is the refractive index of the medium filling the pores.
									</P><P class="text-justify">
									The term 2n<SUB>0</SUB>L is thus the optical path - the path the light 
									travels from the source to the sensor. The factor of two is due to the 
									reflection which means the light travels the length of the pores twice.
									This term is named the <B>Effective Optical Thickness - EOT</B> and is the size we are interested in measuring. 
									A fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the reflectivity spectrum provides us with 
									the frequency of the peaks and is a way to directly measure the EOT.  
									Once bacteria enter the pores they induce measurable changes in the EOT since 
									the light has to travel through the bacteria which have a <B>different refraction 
									index</B> than the clear medium.

									An example for typical interference patterns measured in a full experiment 
									can be seen in figure 2. The graph presents over a 1000 
									interference patterns that are overlaid, giving the illusion of a smear, 
									however that is not the case. The changes in the refractive index during 
									the experiment are translated to changes in the frequency of the intensity 
									which is why the patterns do not line up with one another.

									The system used in this assay including all of its components,

									<A href="http://segallab.technion.ac.il/" target="_blank">Prof. Segal’s team</A>. It relies on the

									In their experiment, both sensors (light beam and CCD spectrometer) 
									were fixed on a single spot of the MPSiAS that was placed in a 
									custom-made flow cell, this was to assure that the samples reflectivity 
									is recorded at the same spot during the entire measurement. Through that 
									flow cell, bacterial suspension was continuously delivered while the 
									samples reflectivity was recorded and analyzed by RIFTS.
									It is clear from their results presented in figure 4, that the introduction 
									of bacteria leads to a rise in the EOT which is attributed to the increase 
									of the refractive index caused due to the entrapment of the bacteria in the pores.

										As our project focuses on the chemotactic movement of bacteria, a different approach 
										was implemented using their system. The focus of said approach was to study the 
										effects of chemo-effectors, both attractants and repellents, on the bacteria and if 
										it can be measured by RIFTS. 
										The steps taken in this assay to fit our approach were the same as mentioned above 
										with a slight change. These changes were as follows:
										1. Wash the chip with a buffer.
										2. Wash the chip with bacteria to fill the pores to <B>full</B> capacity.
										3. Wash the chip with clean medium to remove the cells that have not settled into the pores.
										4. Insert a chemo-effector into the system to measure the bacterial chemotactic response.

									In four experiments a clear change was seen in the EOT upon the addition of the 
									chemo-effectors (step 4 – yellow arrow). The initial sharp jump, up for the 
									repellent or down for the attractant, was due to the change of the solution to 
									one containing the chemo-effector, that has a different refractive index. 
									Nevertheless, following the sharp jump a continuous trend was observed, 
									again going up for the repellent or down for the attractant, which we believe 
									is the chemotactic response of the bacteria
									</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"><P class="text-justify">
									In order to verify the assumption, further analysis was 
									conducted, for all of the four experiments with promising 
									results. Two normalization steps were done to verify the 
									changes and compare between the different experiments and 
									the results are presented below – figure 2. These normalizations were:
									1. Time: this helps in comparing the responses of the different strains over time, 
									the normalization was done according to the following equation:      Time = Time<SUB>n</SUB> - Time<SUB>0</SUB>
									Where:
									Time - The normalized time that passed since the introduction of chemo-effector.
									Time<SUB>0</SUB> - The time elapsed since the start till the addition of the chemo-effector.
									Time<SUB>n</SUB> - The time that elapsed since the start of the experiment. 
									2. OT: this allows to measure the change in the EOT while phasing out the initial jump caused by 
									the solution change. The normalization was done as follows:      EOT = EOT<SUB>n</SUB> - EOT<SUB>0</SUB>
									Where:
									EOT - The EOT measurement relative to EOT<SUB>0</SUB>.
									EOT<SUB>0</SUB> - The EOT measurement following the introduction of chemo-effector and after the initial jump.
									EOT<SUB>n</SUB> - EOT recorded in Time<SUB>n</SUB>. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"><P class="text-center"><B>Fig. 2:</B> Digital chemotaxis measurements – Each of the four lines represents a

								The main hypotheses that might explain the above phenomena is when a 
								chemo-effector is introduced to the system, the bacteria senses the 
								gradient in the Z-axis (height) formed by the diffusion of the substance 
								into the pores. This leads to two different responses:
								On one hand, if the substance was an attractant, the bacteria will 
								travel up the concentration gradient, which means leaving the pores, 
								to the higher concentration above them, leading to a drop in the EOT, 
								as seen in Results tab-figure 2, red line.
								On the other hand, if the substance was a repellent, the bacteria will 
								travel down the gradient, fleeing from the high concentration, deeper 
								into the pores. And thus any bacteria which is not confined will enter
								the pores as well and will lead to rise in the EOT, Results tab-figure 
								2 blue lines.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 vcenter"><P class="text-justify">
								In conclusion, we report here a promising and novel method for the detection of 
								bacterial chemotaxis that provides the means to <B>digitally quantify chemotaxis</B> – 
								in other words, a clear distinction between an attractant response (negative trend), 
								repellent response (positive trend) and no response (zero trend) can be seen and proven 
								with the help of this assay.
