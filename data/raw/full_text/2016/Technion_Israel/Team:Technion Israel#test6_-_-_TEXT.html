Guidance
At the beginning we contacted Peshawar iGEM group because we discovered that both projects deal with detection.            When we realized that the Peshawar group is the first team to represent Pakistan in iGEM we decided to share with            them the knowledge that was accumulated from past Technion iGEM teams.  The first step was to open a joint Facebook            group, so each team member from every group would be able to find his colleague on the opposite team.            Later, we had Skype sessions regarding mathematical modeling, Human practices and Cloning.
Mathematical modeling
We modeled Peshawar iGEM group's system using differential equations and logic gates. The aim of the work was           to predict the expression of the reporter protein when the concentration of the inducer is given. צריך לבקש מנופר שתעבור על זה
Human prctices
We shared with Peshawar iGEM group the layout of our educational program.            In addition, we gave the team advices regarding an appeal to the government with a            request to promote the education in the field of Synthetic Biology.
Cloning
Peshawar had issues with the transformation of plasmids into competent cells.            They elaborated on the exact steps they did in the lab and we tried to debug their procedure.
We also shared with team Peshawar our protocol for chemical transformation(3) and the protocol for producing competent cells(4).
After following our instructions the Peshawar team managed to perform a successful transformation.
