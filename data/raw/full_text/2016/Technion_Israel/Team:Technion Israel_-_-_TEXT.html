S.Tar, by iGEM Technion 2016
Project Super Tar - S.Tar - is designed to be a novel platform for controlled chemotaxis.        We show that by mutating the native Tar LBD or by interchanging it with that of other receptors,         the E. coli chemotaxis system can be programmed to respond to completely new ligands.                As an extension of our system, we designed an easy-to-use detection system, which utilizes         the high sensitivity of the chemotactic response. FlashLab is a simple and cheap platform         for the detection of any chemoeffector, using S.Tar bacteria.
