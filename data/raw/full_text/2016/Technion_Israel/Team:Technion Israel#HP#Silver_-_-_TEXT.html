S.Tar, by iGEM Technion 2016
Beside the lab work we also want to inspire dialogue in our community. For this purpose,              we collaborated with Ran Levi – famous Israeli podcaster, and organized a pub quiz              session at a local pub located in downtown Haifa. The event was composed of three parts:              introduction, quiz and discussion.
Introduction:
Mr. Levi introduced himself and talked about his podcasts, followed by our team members            who introduced synthetic biology, iGEM and our project.
Quiz:
The audience was divided into several groups, questions were presented by Mr. Levi and each group had to answer. The questions were written by Mr. Levi in cooperation with one of our team members and were from a wide range of subjects such as history, literature, biology, cinema and more.
Discussion:
we took advantage of this platform and asked the participants for their thoughts about               using bacteria for the purpose of detection. We got a variety of answers, which led               us to understand that a great deal of work has to be done to change public opinion regarding               the world of microorganisms and its possible applications in our everyday life. We asked the participants one more important               question – What substances would they like to detect using our system? We got more               answers than we can count, but one answer repeated itself, the need for a quick and easy detection of allergens in food. This motivated us to work harder on our system so that maybe one day, it will be able to help the general public
The whole event was recorded and will be published as a new podcast on Ran Levi's website.
