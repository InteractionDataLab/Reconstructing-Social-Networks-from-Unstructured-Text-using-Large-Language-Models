Best new composite part candidate
We chose Histamine-Tar receptor as our Best new composite part. The Histamine-Tar receptor was a  novel design developed, using a bioinformatic computational tool, called Rosetta ,  and shown to function as predicted ,  resulting in chemotaxis response to histamine as an attractant. This property is important, and  can be used in various applications, including detection for various food products, as histamine is known  to be found in spoiled food, especially rotten fish.
This part is composed of strong promoter, Tar native RBS, Tar-Histamine , part K1992002 and a terminator.
To learn more, please check our Histamine-Tar part, K1992011 ,  in the registry.
