A short introsuction
FlashLab offers a set of tools for harnessing the bacterial chemotaxis system. We show that by replacing the Ligand Binding Domain (LBD) of the E. coli Tar-chemoreceptor with various LBD's, or by inserting an inducible intein into the LBD, chemotaxis can be programmed to respond to a substance of our choice.
