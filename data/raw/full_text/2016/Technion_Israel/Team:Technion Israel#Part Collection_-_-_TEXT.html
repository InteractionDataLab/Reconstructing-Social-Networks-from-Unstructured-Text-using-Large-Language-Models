Best part collection candidate
This is our chemotaxis part collection. This collection contains our designed hybrid receptors,  reporters and devices regarding E. coli chemotaxis abilities. The devices in this collection are  versatile, expressing different receptors including versions fused with reporters and with  different RBS. We also included the receptors and reporters as stand alone parts, allowing  other teams to construct their own chemotaxis devices. Each part in this collection is well  documented and tested in the lab, ensuring easy usage for future iGEM teams. As our goal is to  construct a large library containing various receptors and devices for chemotaxis, we believe that  this collection is a great start! Hopefully more teams will contribute to this growing collection  in the future to make chemotaxis more universal and accessible.
