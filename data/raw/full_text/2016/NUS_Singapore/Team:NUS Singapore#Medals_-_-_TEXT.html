This page provides a brief outline of our team's medal completion progress. Our team's judging form entry may be found here . For more details, please visit the respective subpages of our wiki.
Gold Medal
Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project.
Take a look at our Business Plan where we propose on how to provide RIOTSystem diagnostics for the public in a sustainable and forward-looking manner.
Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry.
Take a look at BBa_K1847008 on how we updated characterisation of this part.
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept.
Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab.
Silver Medal
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device.
Take a look at our Parts Registry to see the composite parts we documented and submitted. Take a look at BBa_K1897007 to look at our characterisation on the part as well.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
See our Survey results for more information on the how we ventured to investigate the public attitude towards bacterial-based therapeutics, across different geographical and demographic backgrounds.
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synthetic biology problem.
Take a look at our Collaborations page where we document our partnerships with Melbourne University, Hong Kong University, and ETH-Zurich.
Bronze Medal
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page (section 3).
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
Take a look at our Attributions page for details on our project breakdown.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry. You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part's main page.
Refer to pages BBa_K1897016 and BBa_K1897001 for documentation of our new standard parts.
