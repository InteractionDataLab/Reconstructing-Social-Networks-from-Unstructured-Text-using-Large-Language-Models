Bacterial-based drug delivery systems have gained much interest due to their ability to overcome the issue of non-specific delivery of drugs. This is achieved by engineering bacteria to sense and respond to specific stimuli present in the microenvironment of these pathogenic cells.

</P><P>In this project, we propose the development of a dual-sensor bacteria which can only survive, and release therapeutics, within the targeted part of the human body (i.e., spatially specific). As our proof of concept, we will be engineering the <I>Escherichia coli</I> bacterium to target cancer tumors with high environmental lactate — see <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2849637/pdf/nihms165713.pdf">Warburg effect</A>.

</P><P>To ensure that the bacterium will only affect cancer cells, the bacterium is engineered to detect, and adhere to a cancer specific surface marker. Upon detection, a quorum sensing system and the production of invasin and listeriolysin O is triggered. The invasin and listeriolysin O then allows the bacteria to deliver its payload directly into the cytoplasm of the cancer cell. Since the production of invasin and listeriolysin O cannot occur in the absence of the said marker, this delivery system will only target cancer cells, concentrating drug payload at the intended site.

</P><P>Our team has been working on cloning our desired biobrick parts and modelling our gene circuit. We hope to be able to characterise and optimise our parts, and demonstrate a functional spatially-specific drug delivery system, as well as complement our wet lab efforts with our model.</P></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><H5>Before you start: </H5><P> Please read the following pages:</P><UL><LI><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Requirements">Requirements page </A></LI><LI><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Wiki_How-To">Wiki Requirements page</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Resources/Template_Documentation"> Template Documentation </A></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H5> Styling your wiki </H5><P>You may style this page as you like or you can simply leave the style as it is. You can easily keep the styling and edit the content of these default wiki pages with your project information and completely fulfill the requirement to document your project.</P><P>While you may not win Best Wiki with this styling, your team is still eligible for all other awards. This default wiki meets the requirements, it improves navigability and ease of use for visitors, and you should not feel it is necessary to style beyond what has been provided.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><H5> Wiki template information </H5><P>We have created these wiki template pages to help you get started and to help you think about how your team will be evaluated. You can find a list of all the pages tied to awards here at the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Judging/Pages_for_Awards/Instructions">Pages for awards</A> link. You must edit these pages to be evaluated for medals and awards, but ultimately the design, layout, style and all other elements of your team wiki is up to you!</P></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><H5> Editing your wiki </H5><P>On this page you can document your project, introduce your team members, document your progress and share your iGEM experience with the rest of the world! </P><P>Use WikiTools - Edit in the black menu bar to edit this page</P></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><H5>Tips</H5><P>This wiki will be your team’s first interaction with the rest of the world, so here are a few tips to help you get started: </P><UL><LI>State your accomplishments! Tell people what you have achieved from the start. </LI><LI>Be clear about what you are doing and how you plan to do this.</LI><LI>You have a global audience! Consider the different backgrounds that your users come from.</LI><LI>Make sure information is easy to find; nothing should be more than 3 clicks away.  </LI><LI>Avoid using very small fonts and low contrast colors; information should be easy to read.  </LI><LI>Start documenting your project as early as possible; don’t leave anything to the last minute before the Wiki Freeze.

Remember to keep all your pictures and files within your team's namespace or at least include your team's name in the file name. 
When you upload, set the &quot;Destination Filename&quot; to <CODE>T--YourOfficialTeamName--NameOfFile.jpg</CODE>. (If you don't do this, someone else might upload a different file with the same &quot;Destination Filename&quot;, and your file would be erased!)</P><DIV class="button_click" onclick=" parent.location= 'https://2016.igem.org/Special:Upload '">
