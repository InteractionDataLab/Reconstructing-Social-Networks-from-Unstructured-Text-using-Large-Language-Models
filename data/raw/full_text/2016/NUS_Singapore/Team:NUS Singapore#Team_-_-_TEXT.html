ANG Shi Hui
“Hello! I’m Shi Hui. I am currently a third year student doing Life Sciences, now on exchange in Denmark! I’m interested in human diseases and their potential treatments. In my free time I like to play GAMES :)”
CHOI Yan Ru
“Hi! I'm Yan Ru, a third year student doing Life Sciences. I am interested in learning how microbes can cause human diseases and how we can manipulate them for therapeutic purposes. A random fact about me is that I don't like mint-flavoured ice cream. ”
CHAN Man Yau Joseph
“Cat fanatic and coffee-blooded meteorologist; priorities in that order. When not going bonkers over cats or swimming in atmospheric dynamics, I am the modeler and occasional statistician for the team.”
Janice DARIKHO
"I am a final year Pharmacy student. Most days, I look for glow-worms under the microscope. Hence, favourite quote in lab: Where are my bacteria? iGEM taught me that diversity is to be celebrated and that deadlines wait for no one.”
HAN Ziyin
“Hi there! I am fresh graduate student working on asymmetric cell division mechanism. A sci-fi fan who believed ‘Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything’ is (Cdc)42! ”
Priyanka KAMATH
“I’m a third year student in Life Sciences. Synthetic biology is a field of endless possibilities and that’s exactly what fascinated me the most when I decided to take part this year. iGEM has been an amazing learning experience for me and I’m so thankful to have made it through this journey with great teammates!”
Corey Bryen LINGAM
"Hello! I am a third year Life Sciences student. The iGEM competition has given me the opportunity to learn a lot more about various scientific methods and genetic engineering. The competition has certainly been an interesting experience and has allowed me to discover many innovative and creative ideas that synthetic biology can provide."
Keshiniy MADIVANNAN
"Hi, I'm Keshiniy. I'm a third year Life Sciences student fascinated by synthetic biology and the world of microbes. I also enjoy sweet treats and a good swim, just like my bacteria."
WONG Chi Yan
"I'm a final year undergraduate majoring in Life Science with a second major in Statistics. I was part of Team SPSingapore 2015, and I joined Team NUS_Singapore 2016 as I greatly enjoyed my iGEM experience. Apart from synthetic biology, my other interests lie in microbiology and proteomics."
YEAM Cheng Teng
"I am a final year Life Sciences student at the National University of Singapore. I joined iGEM 2016 to explore more about therapeutics and to befriend more like-minded peers. "
Ms. NGUYEN Hoang Diem Phuong
Ms. Nguyen Hoang Diem Phuong graduated with a first degree in Business Administration and is now doing a second degree in NUS, majoring in Life Sciences. She has always been interested in the interface of science and business and looks to gather experience in that area.
Ms. TAN Yi Han
Ms. Tan Yi Han is a Research Assistant in A/P Gan Yunn Hwen’s lab at the Department of Biochemistry, NUS, and is also a graduate mentor at the Special Programme in Science, NUS. She participated in iGEM as a member of Team SPSingapore 2015 and currently works with bacterial pathogens and the microbiome.
Professor Linda KENNEY
Prof. Linda Kenney is a Professor of Microbiology at the University of Illinois-Chicago and a Principal Investigator at the Mechanobiology Institute, NUS. Her laboratory studies two-component systems in bacteria that control gene expression at a single cell and nanometer level.
Dr Stuti DESAI
Dr. Stuti Desai joined Professor Linda Kenny’s group at MBI, NUS, in May 2012. Previously, she obtained her doctorate from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, under the guidance of Prof Subramony Mahadevan. She currently holds a Senior Research Fellow position at MBI, NUS.
A/P Matthew CHANG
A/P Matthew Chang Wook is the Program Leader of the NUS Synthetic Biology for Clinical and Technological Innovation (SynCTI). His current research projects involve reprogramming of microbes for disease treatment and prevention, and biochemicals production. In particular, he has pioneered the development of microbes programmed to perform targeted pathogen eradication.
Dr WONG Choon Kit, Adison
Dr. Adison Wong Choon Kit is currently the Scientific Program Manager for NUS SynCTI and holds a PhD from Imperial College, London and Nanyang Technological University. His research interests revolve around Synthetic Biology, as he aims to engineer microorganisms with novel biological functions for the betterment of human health, environment and sustainable development.
A/P LIOU Yih-Cherng
Prof. Liou Yih-Cherng is currently the Director of Special Programme in Science at NUS and an Associate Professor at the Department of Biological Sciences, NUS. His research interest spans a wide range of fields, from cell signaling, protein structure and function and most recently the role of microtubule and microtubule based machinery in cell division.
Dr LIEU Zi Zhao, Robert
Dr. Robert Lieu Zi Zhao is currently a lecturer with the Faculty of Science and the Special Programme in Science, as well as the Department of Biological Science at National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore. He enjoys teaching, especially when he sees his students excel beyond what they thought they could accomplish. He always believes that the potential to excel is present in everyone.
Mr. Andreas DEWANTO
Mr. Andreas Dewanto is a physicist by training, an adventurer by passion, and an educator by calling. An Instructor of the Physics Department and the Assistant Director of the Special Programme in Science, NUS, Andreas' interest lies in the field of education technology and science communication.
