As Peter Carr, the director of judging said, "Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work."
Human Practice tells the possibilities of the iGEM future. To make synthetic biology accessible to public and address some questions "beyond the bench", relating to ethics, sustainability, safety, environmental impact and feasibility, we, Team TJUSLS_China, well planned a variety of human practice activities. We sure that our work do color the imagine of the future of iGEM and the future of synthetic biology.
