Software
Our software can calculate peak area of any substance by the raw data of HPLC conveniently and accurately. It can display the image details saved at any period of time. It also can automatically identify substance peak and calculate the area. In addition, we can manually select the range of the area calculated. What’s more, in order to facilitate the analysis, it can store the results of calculations in a same file which contains the filename of the HPLC data.
