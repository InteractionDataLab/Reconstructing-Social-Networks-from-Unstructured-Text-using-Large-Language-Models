TJUSLS_China for Nankai_China
1. During the Tianjin University Begonia Science Popularization Festival, we invited the Team Nankai_China to participate in our activities. We led them to visit the campus of Tianjin University and our labs then have in-depth and friendly exchanges, laying a solid foundation for our future cooperation.
2. We provided the two parts (Plate3 6C. BBA_I13602, Plate2 3K. BBa_K561000) to the Team Nankai_China when they lost their Distribution Kit.
Nankai_China for TJUSLS_China
1. The Team Nankai_China invited us to visit Nankai University during the Lotus  Festival. We did introductions of our projects at an exchange meeting with the attendance of two professors from Nankai University. In the exchange we have broaden the experimental ideas and got a lot of pertinent suggestions from professors.
2. It is really touching that the captain offered to lend us their fluorescent microscope on his own initiative while ours has been broken. It helps a lot.
