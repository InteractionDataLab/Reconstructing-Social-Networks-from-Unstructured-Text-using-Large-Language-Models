Education & Public Engagement
By hosting Science & Education Exhibition in Open Day on our campus where over 30,000 people entered our campus and Showed their interest in our exhibition and the Children's Day exhibition with many families participate us, we worked with people of all ages and education levels, from children to adults, to spark new scientific curiosity, to enhance their understanding of biology, specifically synthetic biology and to establish a public dialogue from voices outside the lab. Additionally, through holding such science lecture for students, making yearly social practice report, we did our utmost to make synthetic biology accessible to both students and teachers.
