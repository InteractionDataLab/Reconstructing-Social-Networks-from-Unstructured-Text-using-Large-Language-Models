Mutation
Surface display in E.coli
Surface display in pichia pastoris、fusing secretion of hydrophobin and PETase and their co - display
Results
One of the vital results of our team this year is managing to analyze the high resolution of the PETase protein structure.To verify if the surface display is successful, we also do western blot, immunofluorescence assay and using HPLC to detecte enzyme activity.( click here to see the HPLC results)
