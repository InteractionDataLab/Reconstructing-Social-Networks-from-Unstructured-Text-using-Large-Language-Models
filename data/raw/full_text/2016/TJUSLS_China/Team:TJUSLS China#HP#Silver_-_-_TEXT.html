Overview
To introduce the synthetic biology to general masses, we hold two opening activities and set up an online platform. And our outlays have been paid back.
White Crabapple Season Open Day
On 15th April 2016, Tianjin University opened its doors to the general public for its fifth White Crabapple Season Open Day, where this year we hosted a stand. Over 30,000 people entered our campus throughout the day and visited our Science Popularization Stand.
Our stand plays an essential role that major in popularize synthetic biology knowledge with easy experiments that can be operated by the audiences while doing no harms, like blood type test and so on. Meanwhile, members from our team will introduce the principle of the experiment then answer questions. There are other forms of fun games contained biological questions battle, color filling the drawings about biology and our campus, compete in describing our project in more detail after reading our poster about iGEM and our team. Besides, we also prepare some interesting specimen for observation, like specimen if onions, oral epithelial cells and so on.
Our stand attracts a lot of attention during the whole festival. Many kids coming here with their parents feel a sense of accomplishment when they see the experiment results come out by themselves. These bio-experiments excite the curiosity of the children. That is one the best advancement of synthetic biology.
Children's Day
After the Begonia Science Popularization Festival, there still be a lot of families which have missed our stand in festival want to lead the child to experience more about biology and contact us. We think it will be a good chance and set up a Children's Day, a little trip in laboratory.
We give 10 families warm reception. In the laboratory teacher's guidance help, team members carefully prepared and hold a little speech with easy-understanding language to introduce the mystery image of the micro-kingdom, also cited the classic Chinese "Journey to the West" plot to explain the process of phage infection of bacteria. The students teach the use of microscopic laboratory instruments and observed microorganisms such as mold, penicillium and mucor. According to that, the children know what is the microorganism, why should they wash their hands frequently. The whole event lasts about three hours. Children really like that.

Teaching with kids is hard but enjoyable. They showed great enthusiasm and curiosity, which give us a great encouragement with laughers and the planting of a biology seeds
Internet Dissemination
As soon as we started our project, we set up a public account on wechat to publish some information and news about iGEM and us. Up to now, there are almost 1,000 followers with many likes about our essays.
Internet gives us a broader window to show our advantages. In terms of public education, a better platform means more receivers. Our public account will run for long time to introduce more highlights to our fans.
