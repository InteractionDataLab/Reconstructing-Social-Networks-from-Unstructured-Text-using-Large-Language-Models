Mutation:
Figure 1. The Comparison of the enzyme activity between PETase and three kinds of mutated PETase. The reaction condition is 100μL solution,pH 9.0(bicine-NaOH), 40 degree, 18h, the substrate is a round with a diameter of 2mm. The results are detected by Hplc. The y-axis stands for the area of the peak of MHET, the main product of the PETase’s degrading of PET. The x-axis stands for the concentration of the protein.
Figure 2. PETase’s self-degrading condition in different temperature. We take the quantity of PETase in the day the experiment begines as 100%. We can now see when stored in low temperature, the protein was degraded slowly, but in room temperature, the protein degrades rapidly. The Quantity of PETase left was measured by protein gel and analysised by a computer program called GEL-PRO.
