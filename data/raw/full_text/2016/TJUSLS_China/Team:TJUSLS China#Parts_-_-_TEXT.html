About Parts
Our team is sending 27 different well characterized and tested parts (BBa_K1921000-BBa_K1921026)which are compatible with the iGEM standard! Firstly, this package provided PETase and its mutates which have the degradation efficiency and thermal stability. Moreover, Surface display of enzyme is really an effective measures that can improve the enzyme's degrading efficiency. This package will give all future iGEM teams the possibility to express the PETase on the cell surface of E.coli or pichia pastoris for whole cell catalysis in a really easy and fast way. Thirdly, fusing secreting the hydrophobin and PETase and co - display them which improved degradation efficiency observably are also becoming convenient.
