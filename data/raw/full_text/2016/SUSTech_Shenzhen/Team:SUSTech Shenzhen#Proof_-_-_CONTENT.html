We used genetically encoded calcium indicator (R-GECO) to quantitatively examine the sensibility of Piezo1 and TRPC5 channels. We used hypoosmolarity as a positive control stimuli and validate the function of the MS channels and Calcium sensor. 
We designed a microfluidic chip to quantitatively tune the shear force exerted on cell membrane, and both channel are responsive to such mechical stress. Surprisingly, we discovered that Piezo1-expression CHO cell response to shear force in an biphasic manner and a maximum responsive of ~0.3 pa. We haven't found similar report in the past. 
We also examined the intracellular calcium response to various combination of frequency and intensity of sound.We discovered that Piezo1-expression CHO cell are very sensitive to 15khz sound and not to 10khz, which indicate the previous identified touching sensing Piezo1 channel could detect sound wave of particular frequency range. 
Finally, we engineered CHO cell with a GFP gene under the control of NFAT promoter to detect chronic  calcium signal). With which, we further developed tools for direct evolution of TRPC5 towarding mutants with high sensitivity to specific sound parameters.
All in all, our project is well organized. Each procedure is indispensable. We not only implemented audiogenetics with synthetic biology to sense mechanical stress and sound, but only use it as a research tool for discover novel mechanical properties of Piezo1. The whole project can strongly prove the possibility of using sound wave energy as the extracellular input signal to induce intracellular downstream signal.

And there were distinct oscillations of fluorescence when osmolarity was below 70%. However, fluorescence of cells with R-GECO (Fig. 4b) only showed obvious increase and oscillation when the osmolarity was 60%, whose intensity was a lot less than R-GECO+Piezo1 (Fig. 4c).

Selection by Cre-loxp system</SPAN></H1><P>Cre-loxp system played an important role in directed evolution, because we needed to screen a single cell colony only with one loxp site in the genome of each CHO-K1 cell for single copy insert of mutated TRPC5. Here we tested the function of cre-loxp system by making 3 different groups of transfection in the cells that already inserted with loxp gene on genomes using Lipofectamine® 3000.

<P>Few cells survives (Fig15. a) after antibiotics screening without transfecting Cre recombinase gene, which means that there is a small possibility that loxp gene can insert into genomes by interior transposase in cells. To find out the optimal ratio of Cre recombinase gene to Neomycin-loxp gene in the process of transfection, we compared two different ratio, 3:3 (Fig15. b) and 1:3 (Fig15. c), with equal amount of Neomycin-loxp gene but different amount of Cre recombinase gene.(All pictures was captured by Nikon microscope (Nikon TS100) 120 hours after transfection, 600 μg/ml neomycin were added 72hours  screening.
</P><P>From observation, we know that excess Cre recombinase is not appropriate in transfection process. The most possible reason is that surplus Cre recombinase is harmful for cells, so they may random cut and recombine genes in cell’s genome. Thus, we finally chose 1:3 as the ratio of Cre recombinase gene to Neomycin-loxp gene in transfection.

Cells transfected with R-GECO gene will continually express R-GECO, because CAG promoter is a constitutive promoter. Thus, most cells have red fluorescence (Fig16. b) compare with wild type control (Fig16. a). Cells transfected with pNFAT+GFP should not express GFP because promoter NFAT need to be activated by calcium signal indirectly. However, most cells still can express GFP (Fig.16 d) compare with wild type control (Fig.16 c), which mean there is some leaky expression of promoter NFAT or background calcium activity.
</P><P>2. Select the single cell colony only with one copy number of loxp by qPCR 
</P><P>To evaluate the efficiency of each mutated channels, single cell colony with only one copy number is required when testing, so we designed the following experiments to achieve it.   
</P><P><B>2.1 Primer design and primer efficiency test</B></P><P>The real-time PCR primers (Forward: TTGTCAAGACCGACCTGTCC, Reverse: TTCAGTGACAACGTCGAGCA) were designed by Primer-BLAST, a tool for finding specific primers, followed by BLAST specificity check. Firstly, we selected an appropriate annealing temperature to avoid unnecessary amplification as well as improving primer efficiency by normal PCR test in wild type CHO-K1 genomes, the result indicates that 62℃ may be the most appropriate annealing temperature. In addition, we also confirmed that the amplification product was accurate at 62℃ when the target was cells genome that transfected with neomycin-loxp gene by sequencing the PCR product.
</P><P>Real-time PCR ( here we used TaKaRa-SYBR Premix Ex Taq II(Tli RNaseH Plus) ran in the ABI StepOne Plus qPCR instrument) can be used to calculate the primer efficiency of PCR amplification via Equation 1. In which <SPAN>X_n</SPAN> = PCR product quantity after n cycles, <SPAN>X_0</SPAN> = initial copy number, <SPAN>E</SPAN> = amplification efficiency, <SPAN>n</SPAN> = cycle number. 
</P><P><SPAN class="katex-block">X_n=x_0 \times (1+E)^n</SPAN></P><P>Equation 1
</P><P>The efficiency of the primer is 104% by calculating (Within the usual margin of error, which is 90%~110%). Also, the melt curve has only one peak, which means the designed primer is quite specific to the transfected CHO-K1 cell’s genomic DNA.
</P><P><B> 2.2 Select the cell colony with single copy number</B></P><P>In each qPCR screening experiment, we made a standard curve by employing a series of 5-fold dilution gradient Neomycin-loxp gene with known mole amount. Therefore, we could quantitatively examined the copy number of neomycin-loxp gene in single colony genomes by fitting the sample Ct data in the standard amplification plot.  Standard curve was made by using the following data.

Consequently, it’s quite possible for us to screen out the cells with single or low copies of Neomycin-loxp.
</P><P>In practical experiments, we totally test 18 different single colony genomes. The lowest copy number of those selected CHO-K1 cell transfected with Neomycin-loxp is around 4, which was not good enough. The reason may be that the designed primer was not so satisfying. Also, the contamination during real-time PCR was hard to avoid. To get cells with single copy of Neomycin-loxp, we still need to design better primers as well as paying attention to the experiment operations. 
</P><P><B>3. Transfect the cells with mutated TRPC5 by Cre-loxp system</B></P><P>After we’ve selected the CHO-K1 cell transfected with single copy of NeoLoxp, we could transfect mutated TRPC5 into the cell’s genomic DNA using Cre-Loxp recombination system. Then we would use fluorescence activated cell sorting(FACS) to select the cells with high intensity of GFP after long term stimulation. To realize high-throughput screening, we designed a device as shown in the figure below. Cells are seeded at the larger area side of the bottle, and the bottle is fixed above vortex through a holder and foam. Then we are going to place this device in cell culture incubator with vortex running for 20 hours, to fulfill long term mechanical force stimulation.   
</P><DIV class="thumbnail pull-right-sm"><DIV class="caption">Figure 21. Self-designed Device for Long Term Stimulation</DIV></DIV><P>After the first round of mutation and screening, we still need to continue mutation based on the previous result. We will extract genomic DNA of the screened-out CHO-K1 cell, performing polymerase chain reaction with the mutation primer and sending the PCR product for sequencing. Through alignment of the mutated TRPC5 with normal one, we could clearly see which base site has been mutated. Combing with the TRPC5 structure we’ve known, we may explain why the specific site mutation could induce channel’s greater sensitivity to mechanical force. Then we could specify the mutation region every time, repeating then huge-library mutation and high-throughout screening procedure, thus realizing directed evolution.
</P><P>Ideally, we would like to screen out then mutated TRPC5 with high sensitivity to mechanical force. As for the audiogenetics, we hope to screen out cells which are able to response to specific sound frequency, achieving precise and orthogonal audio regulation.
