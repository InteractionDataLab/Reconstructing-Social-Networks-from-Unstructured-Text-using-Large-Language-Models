3 Part List
This year, we totally submitted 27 BioBricks, including 15 basic Parts and 12 composite Parts. We always want to contribute all of the components used in our programs and we welcome all researchers to use, measure and modify our Parts for their projects. We spared no effort do diversify our BioBricks and we successfully constructed BioBricks of several categories as listed below:
1. Basic Parts:
TRPC5 family:
Sound sensitive channel TRPC5 gene coding sequence with or without mutagenesis on ankyrin repeats region through direct evolution. This set is also our Part Collection.
Parts Collection
R-GECO coding sequence:
Intracellular calcium indicator gene coding sequence with site-directed mutation on 2 PstI and 1 EcoRI recognition sites in original sequence.
TetOn regulation system:
Tetracycline-responsive promoter whose downstream gene expression can be induced by doxycycline.
Antibiotics resistance gene:
Coding sequence of blasticidin S HCl nucleoside antibiotic/ phleomycin D1/puromycin resistance genes with or without 2A sequence that can be used for eukaryotic cell selection.
Mutated sfGFP coding sequence:
Green fluorescence gene coding sequence with site-directed mutation on KpnI restriction site.
Basic Part
2. Composite Parts:
Chromoproteins:
Yellow/Red/Pink/Purple chromoprotein reporter system driven by Strong Promoter-Strong RBS or Strong Promoter-Strong RBS.
sfGFP and mutated sfGFP:
Green fluorescence reporter system driven by Strong Promoter+ Strong RBS with or without site-directed mutation on KpnI restriction site in sfGFP coding sequence.
