Flow Cytometer Measurement
Materials
194.7 g FITC (provided in kit)
10ml 1xPBS (phosphate buffered saline) 96 well plate
Competent cells (Escherichia coli strain DH5α)
LB (Luria Bertani) media with Chloramphenicol (stock concentration 25 mg/mL dissolved in EtOH), 1 ml Falcon tube for cell growth Incubator at 37°C, 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes for sample storage Ice bucket with ice,Pipettes, SpheroTech Rainbow Calibration Particles RCP-30-5A, CytoFlex flow cytometer
Devices (from InterLab Measurement Kit):
Positive control
Negative control
Device 1: J23101+I13504
Device 2: J23106+I13504
Device 3: J23117+I13504
Methods
Open computer, click cytometer setting, load clean solution and system startup program for initialization.
Load QC(Lot: 45065) falcon tube to do pre-tests.
Load Rainbow beads, set FSC-A-SSA, FSC-A-FSC-H, FITC-A-Count.
Mix 100ul overnight culture with PBS, load samples and examine the fluorescence.
Close experiment and perform daily clean with ddH2O. Exit the software.
