The Southern University of Science and Technology iGEM team (SUSTech_Shenzhen.2016) was responsible for almost all parts of this project on our own, including laboratory establishment, supply and reagent purchase, brainstorming, project idea conception, and lab work execution. In addition, we would like to sincerely thank all those who have helped us over this year.
SPECIAL THANKS
Professor Wei Huang, Biology
For providing essential lab facilities, and kind advices on various aspects on our project like circuit construction, cell linage, quantitative metrics and microfluidics. He also generously provided us with the PiggyBac system, doxcyline-inducible systems and Cre-Lox system.
Professor Yu Chung Tse, Biology
For providing advice on experimental design; helped us with brainstorming.
Professor Jiankui He, Biology
For providing guides for the participation of IGEM
Professor Fangyi Chen, Biomedical Engineering
For helping us with theories on sound generator design.
Professor Jaewon Park, Electrical Engineering
For helping with troubleshooting and theories in microfluidics design and experiments.
Professor Xin Cheng, Material Science and Engineering
For providing access and expertise support to his microfabrication facility. 
Professor Bin Tang, Biomedical Engineering
For helping computing the mechanical stress on the cells with various experimental setups. 
ALSO THANKS
Professor Maojun Yang of Tsing Hua University
For generously providing us with the Piezo1 gene. It is a 7.5kb gene and very difficult to clone.
Professor Jianbo Yue of Hong Kong City University
For generously providing us with the R-Geco1 gene and advices on calcium data analysis.
