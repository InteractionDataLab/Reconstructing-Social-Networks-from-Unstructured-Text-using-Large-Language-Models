In this synthetic biology project, we believe that carefully carried out modeling will be critical for the experiment design and data analysis at different stages of the project. We hope to demonstrate that the modeling is especially helpful to finalize the microfluidics chip design, and determine the absolute shear force in the experiments, as well as characterization and optimization of acoustic stimulation experiments.
</P><P>Simplified fluidic mechanic theory is sufficient to guide the geometry design of shear force screening microfluidics chip. Together with direct experimental measurement of flow speed, numerical simulation of the flow in the microfluidics chip using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) enable us to derive actual shear force in the chip.
</P><P>On the other hand, the acoustic stimulation devices are very different from each other. Our empirical is not sufficient to help select and data analysis. We use Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to model the force field generated by the acoustic stimulators, with the help of acoustometer measurements.
</P><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Force_Field">Force Field</SPAN></H1><P>To quantitatively measure the response of MS channel on the cell membrane, we designed our experiment manipulated on microfluidic chip. CHO-K1 cells were cultured adherent on the bottom of PDMS channels. Stable and flexible force field could be formed surrounding cell, which directly controlled by the pumped-inflow rate. Each time when we applied a constant pumped inflow, cells in 3 different observation channels could receive corresponding small, middle, large, 3 level of force magnitude(1: 9: 81). By changing the pumped flow rate, we could measure MS channel response under a series of forces with different magnitude order.
</P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><DIV class="thumbnail"><DIV class="caption"><B>Fig. 1 Microfluidic Channels</B></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Mathematical_Analysis">Mathematical Analysis</SPAN></H2><P>During experiment, when fluid(culture media x flowed through the channels, the shear force was applied on a thin layer close to wall. The culture media can be treated as a Newtonian flow with a constant viscosity μ,0.012dyn·s/cm<SUP>2</SUP><SUP id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-1">[1]</A></SUP>. The shear stress that medium generated on the wall is proportional to strain rate. As a result, we could relate the magnitude of stress to the velocity gradient along the transversal surface of each channel.
</P><P>Due to the extremely small scale of microfluidic channel (only 0.285mm of width and 0.090mm of height), fluid in it exists as the Laminar flow. Turbulent flow is not possible with the physiology range of flow speed, even at the corners.  The head loss of the pumped inflow is also negligible in our experiment.  The modeling of flow between 2 parallel plates applies to such stable state, in which the magnitude of shear stress on the bottom is proportional to the maximum velocity ( shown as the longitudinal central line in Fig. 2).
</P><P>As the shear stress is proved proportional to the flow rate in the channels, we designed the chip to achieve that each of 3 channels in observation area has the same transversal surface but the gradient (81: 9: 1 from up to bottom) flow rate, also the average speed, as shown in Fig. 3.

According to the Kirchhoff's law, the accumulation of flow speed at the joint point must be zero. It is easy to get the equation that<SPAN class="katex-block">\begin{matrix} L_{AC}V_1=L_{AB}V_2+R_{AB} V_3 \\

To verify the modeling result, we made calibration in the real microfluidics chip, and the testing result is very close to designing value (about 75 : 8 : 1 of the maximum velocity ratio in each channel) and the simulation result (80 : 8 : 1).

A collection of smaller elements is called a “mesh”, the “mesh” is constructed by numerous elements, the smaller the size of the element is, the finer the “mesh” is, and the more accurate will the result be.

</P><P>To explain that, a modal analysis method could be used when a buzzer was attached to the bottom of a cell dish, the shear stress induced by the asynchronism between cell culture medium and cell dish buzzer-forced oscillation is the driving factor of the channel response.
