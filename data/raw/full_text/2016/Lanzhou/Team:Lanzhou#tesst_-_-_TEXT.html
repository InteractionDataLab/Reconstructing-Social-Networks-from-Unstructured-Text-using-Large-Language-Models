So glad to join the IGEM family! My name is Yajuan Xie,an undergraduate of Lanzhou university and I major in stomatology. This time my main work of the wet lab is about the fish, like feeding and dissecting.In the dry lab,my main task is about the human practice. In addition,I also assist other teammates in experiment and establishing our wlki.Although my specialty isn’t biology,but I much enjoy the time with IGEM,it taught me a lot which I can’t learn from my text book.And I thanks my team members sincerely.

Hi ! I’m Zhen Xie , an undergraduate of Lanzhou university who major in biology. As a newcomer , I’m poor at either theoretical knowledge or the experimental skills,given that, my major work is to edit a fraction of the wiki copy-writing.But fortunately, as I pour time and effort in learning as much as I can from the project,I’ve improved a lot.

’m a rising junior student at Lanzhou University. As I always hold that we students should not only learn lectures and textbooks, but also develop ourselves in all-around way,I take part in IGEM which provides opportunities for me to learn new skills in many aspects. In our team, I participated in part of the laboratory work and helping to establish Wiki.I learned a lot from my teammates and I also enjoy the time that everyone works together.

Lucky to join our team! We tried a lot together in order to come up with some amazing ideas to apply for real practice via synthetic biology. By reading papers and books, browsing webs and thinking constantly,finally we’ve managed it! I have to say that good teamwork is much important.My main task is to feed the fishes and assist other teammates in conducting experiments.In the meantime,I also direct the designing work of our team uniform. Anyway, I believe that “Do what must and should do indeed, and we will carry out one day!” COME ON!

It is my first year to take part in iGEM. I did experiments such as feeding the fishes, detecting the heavy iron in the fish, detecting the modeled bacteria and so on. I also wrote the parts of our team and estabished our website with my teammates. I learnt a lot by taking part in iGEM. It is really a good experience.

Hi ! I’m Pengfei Luo,you can also call me Gino. Taking part in the iGEM team of Lanzhou university has always been my dream, and this year, I was lucky enough to join it. I’m sure that IGEM is a stage where everyone is able to fully displays themselves. In this group,I synthesized function DNA sequence and transferred sequence into plasmid.This experience has benefited me a lot and I will spare no efforts to complete it!

Hi, I’m Anqi Wei. I’m a girl of many interests, which include playing the violin, dancing and traveling. I was a junior when I decided to take part in our iGEM team of 2016. For me, it is a great opportunity and it is also a platform for students who major in life sciences, engineering, computer and so on throughout the world. This year, I did part of the laboratory works with upper-class students and managed the contents of our Wiki with other team members. This experience will definitely has a far-reaching influence on me and I’m ready to enjoy this giant event!

I'm so glad to be a member of our team.My main duties are conducting part of the experiments with other team members, participating in writing our web, and giving some ideas of the packing design. IGEM gives us the chance to make a connection between the theory and reality.Meanwhile,it reminds us to be more concerned about the environment and the earth. And most important, it is an excellent stage where we can try out our ideas.Hope that we could return in triumph！

I'm Xinyu Zhou, team leader of Lanzhou, a senior student major in biology in Lanzhou University. My personal interest is about cancer protein. Though I'm a second-time iGEMer, it is really a challenge for me to be a leader 'cause I have to focus on several things at the same time. Thanks to my brilliant  teammates, they're very reliable. We've done a very good job so far. I believe we can make it in Boston.
