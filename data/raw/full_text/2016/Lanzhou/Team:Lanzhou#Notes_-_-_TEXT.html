Week 16(Jul25-Aug 1)
We bought fish (Cyprinus carpio) from the market in order to prepare the experiment on fish.We mixed the engineered E.coli with dry fodder in order to feed fish the engineered bacteria.
These work was done by Anqi Wei, Jindian He, Ning Chai, Qi Li, Yiding Xu and Puxin Wang.
Week 17(Aug2-Aug9)
We started our experiment on fish. We did preliminary test by treating fish with different concentrations of mercury (0.1mg/L,0.15mg/L and 0.2 mg/L) in order to determine the best concentration. Finally, the concentration we chose to use in experiment was 0.1mg/L. Cyprinus carpio of size ranging from 7.483–8.348 g weight and 5.75–6.52 cm length, were introduced into fish tanks of 20-L capacity, which contained 6 L tap water. Each tank contained ten fish. We fed fish with fodder containing engineered E. coli and used a commercial fish feed containing crude protein (Min 30%), crude fat (Min 20%), crude fiber (Min 4%), moisture (Max 5%), and algae (Max 25%) as control. We fed fish, changed water (containing 0.1mg Hg2+) and recorded mortality, external signs, and growth conditions of the fish everyday. Also, we extracted the flesh of dead fish in order to detect the mercury.
These work was done by Zhichen Lin, Xinyu Zhou, Jindian He, Ning Chai and Qi Li.

Week 21(Sept3-Sept10)
After 30 days of feeding, we dissected all the sampled fish using sterile scissors and extract the took out intestines. Then we examined samples of intestines and extracted the total DNAusing TIANamp Stool DNA kit. We amplified the V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene using universal primer 515F and 909R with 12 nt unique barcode for pyrosequencing using Miseq sequencer.
When the OD600 of engineered E. coli reached 1.3, we added an appropriate concentration of mercury ions (0, 6.5, 12.5, 25 mg/L) to LB medium. In order to measure the metal ion adsorption ability of GFP-MC displayed on E. coli, we harvested cells from LB medium by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 3 min) and then washed them twice with saline. Then we analyzed total mercury by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.
These work was done by Xinyu Zhou, Anqi Wei, Puxin Wang, Yiding Xu, Ning Chai and Zheyuan Zhang.
Week 22(Sept11-Sept18)
We diluted, denatured, re-diluted the purified library and mixed it with PhiX (equal to 30% of final DNA amount) in accordance with the Illumina library preparation protocols, and then applied it to an Illumina Miseq system for sequencing with the Reagent Kit v22 × 250 bp according to the manufacturer’s manual. We processed the sequence data using QIIME Pipeline–Version 1.7.0.In order to measure the selectivity of the E. coli to adsorb mercury ions, we added 6.5 mg/l Hg2+ and Cd2+, and 12.5 mg/l Cu2+ and Zn2+ in place of the mercury and measured the metal ion content in the samples by atomic absorption spectrophotometr(AAS).
These work was done by Xinyu Zhou, Anqi Wei, Zhicheng Lin, Puxin Wang, Yiding Xu, Ning Chai and Zheyuan Zhang.
Week 23(Sept19-Sept26)
