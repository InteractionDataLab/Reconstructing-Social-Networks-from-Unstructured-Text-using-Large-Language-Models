To enter a competition of this magnitude is an impressive feat for any high school, let alone one that is entering for the first time and with minimal help from any Universities. We were told countless times to wait till we go to University to enter, or to spend this year raising funds and to enter next year. However, thanks to the generosity of the School and in particularly to Sarah Fletcher the Head, we raised enough money to enter 4 boys and the PI to Jamboree although every boy has done enough to merit a place. We have completed the vast majority of our lab work without any outside help, and we are thankful to Imperial for lending a helping hand when, and only when, required. We are in the unusual position of being in a boys only team, simply because CLS is a Boyâ€™s School. However the fact that our team is comprised from only one school, unlike many of our competitors, has proved advantageous. We are able to meet up at incredibly short notice and we have gone through the inevitable ups and downs of microbiology as a coherent unit. The smaller number of people in the pool to choose from forced us to look beyond Biology as the primary skillset of useful Team members, and the resulting montage of skillsets in our team has allowed us to reach such heights. </P></DIV><UL id="verticalselector"><LI class="v1"><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:CLSB-UK/Team"><DIV class="v1"> Team </DIV></A></LI><LI class="v2"><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:CLSB-UK/Collaborations"><DIV class="v2"> Collaborations </DIV></A></LI><LI class="v3"><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:CLSB-UK/Attributions"><DIV class="v3"> Attributions </DIV></A></LI><LI class="v4"><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:CLSB-UK/Sponsors"><DIV class="v4"> Sponsors </DIV></A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
