In particular, our project lends itself well to making an impact on the wider public. Addressing such an important issue as the global energy crisis is a cause worthy of public engagement, which we indeed strived for over the course of the project. It turns out that countless hours spent talking to parents of students at school, writing articles for the school newspaper and presenting talks about our project were not wasted. Mr Zivanic’s Twitter prowess and Jake’s endlessly enthusiastic rambling about our project did not go unnoticed, and by the time Jamboree came around students, teachers and parents alike were engaging with members of our team all the time, asking probing questions about where our money was going as well as raising some of the more serious ethical and moral issues surrounding synthetic biology. Science is meant to be shared with the public and made accessible to everyone, and we believe we have succeeded in this with the human practices side of our project. </P></DIV><UL id="verticalselector"><LI class="v1"><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:CLSB-UK/Human_Practices"><DIV class="v1"> Human Practices </DIV></A></LI><LI class="v2"><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:CLSB-UK/Engagement"><DIV class="v2"> Engagement </DIV></A></LI><LI class="v3"><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:CLSB-UK/Safety"><DIV class="v3"> Safety </DIV></A></LI><LI class="v4"><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:CLSB-UK/HP/Silver"><DIV class="v4"> Medal Requirements </DIV></A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
