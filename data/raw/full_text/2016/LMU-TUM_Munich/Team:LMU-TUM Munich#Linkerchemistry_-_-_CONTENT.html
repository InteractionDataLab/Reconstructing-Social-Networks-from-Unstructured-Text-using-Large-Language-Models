Our results show that using the flexible aminocaproic acid as this spacer makes resultant biotinylation more easily cleavable by biotinidase, and using the bulky valine stabilizes the biotinylation. Synthesis of these derivatives is straightforward, inexpensive, and proceeds in good to high yield. Importantly, the biotinylation reagents synthesized here are much less costly than commercial equivalents. Thus, we show that altering the chemical biotinylation reagent is a feasible approach toward influencing the stability of our cell mesh, and that designing and testing further spacers may help fine-tune the properties of this <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:LMU-TUM_Munich/Proof">mesh</A>.

This ubiquitous enzyme is able to cleave biotin off of lysine – at a lower rate also off of intact protein. We may now shift this hydrolysis in two directions: either to prevent it altogether and thus stabilize our cell mesh, or to accelerate it to make our mesh quickly disintegrable. To this end, we must consider how biotin is linked to the proteins in our bioink.

While this aminolysis pathway is also used in chemical synthesis, e.g. of peptides, it is key for the above-mentioned protein-labeling capability of NHS esters. The latter, however, strictly requires aqueous reaction media, so that the undesirable hydrolysis, i.e. reaction with water to give the no longer reactive carboxylic acid (Figure 2, right), becomes a considerable side reaction even though reaction with amines, being more nucleophilic, is favored. At pH 7.0 and 0 °C, for instance, hydrolysis half-life is 4 to 5 h. For this reason, protein labeling must needs employ a great excess of NHS ester.<SUP id="cite_ref-hermanson2013_1-2" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-hermanson2013-1">[1]</A></SUP><SUP id="cite_ref-anderson1963_2-2" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-anderson1963-2">[2]</A></SUP><SUP id="cite_ref-anderson1964_4-0" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-anderson1964-4">[4]</A></SUP><SUP id="cite_ref-kalkhof2008_5-0" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-kalkhof2008-5">[5]</A></SUP></P></DIV><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:832px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Figure 2:</B> Productive aminolysis and non-productive hydrolysis as competing reaction pathways in protein-labeling reactions with NHS esters in aqueous media.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="white-box"><P>For applications routinely requiring derivatization of primary amines, NHS esters are advantageous for a number of reasons.

This was accomplished by assaying a concentration series of each biotinylation reagent in duplicates starting from 100 μM (BioNHS and BioCapNHS) or 1000 μM (BioValNHS) and diluting 1:2 in the next set of wells across one row (12 wells), and calculating the slope and its error for each set of two identical wells. This slope corresponds to the activity of ExtrAvidin-AP immobilized in the well and thus to the biotinylation level.

In the semilogarithmic plot of d<I>A</I><SUB>405</SUB>/d<I>t</I> against log <I>c</I> (Figure 6 right), the graphs of BioValNHS and BioNHS are apparently exponential; however, the slope of the BioCapNHS curve is sigmoidal around an approximately linear central range. This tallies with our expectations from a mathematical point of view: With rising NHS ester concentration, the biotinylation level will first rapidly increase and then gradually approach a horizontal asymptote signifying saturation, i.e. full biotinylation of BSA. The semi-logarithmic plot then transforms a saturation curve into a sigmoidal graph in which the central linear section is the target dynamic range.<SUP id="cite_ref-invitrogen2006_20-0" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-invitrogen2006-20">[20]</A></SUP> We find both of these correlations to be true in our experimental setup, even though the sigmoidal shape is only achieved by BioCapNHS; the other derivatives have evidently not been tested at sufficient concentration to attain saturation. 
</P><P>Interestingly, the development of the concentration series' data points differs significantly between the three derivatives: Compared to the standard BioNHS, BioCapNHS affords a steeper curve that reaches the same ExtrAvidin-AP activity at lower reagent concentrations and that appears to also achieve a higher absolute activity, i.e. a higher biotinylation level. Conversely, BioValNHS has a drastically diminished increase in ExtrAvidin-AP activity with rising reagent concentration, achieving a biotinylation equivalent to 1 μM of BioNHS and BioCapNHS only at 200 μM. This suggests that the biotinylation activity of the three derivatives is different, with BioCapNHS being most efficient and BioValNHS being distinctly less effective than BioNHS.
</P><P>Aiming to ensure an approximately equal initial slope in the following debiotinylation assay, we chose the concentrations 2 μM (BioCapNHS), 5 μM (BioNHS), and 1 mM (BioValNHS) for biotinylation of the test plate, the data points of which lie at d<I>A</I><SUB>405</SUB>/d<I>t</I> ≈ 0.00035.

(Note that data points below 1 min were left out, as they fluctuated strongly, suggesting that the system may require some equilibration time.) As such, none out of BioNHS, BioCapNHS, and BioValNHS appear to afford entirely biotinidase-resistent biotinylation of albumin. Nevertheless, visual inspection already shows that decrease in initial slope, and thus of biotinylation level, is not equally fast. To quantify this difference, each curve was fitted as an exponential decay to determine the half-life of the biotinylation level. We obtain <I>t</I><SUB>0.5</SUB> = 66, 2767, and 42  min for BioNHS, BioValNHS, and BioCapNHS, respectively. Thus, BioCapNHS is cleaved somewhat faster than BioNHS, whereas BioValNHS is significantly more stable against biotinidase exposure than either of these two derivatives. Control experiments incubating with plasma and PNPP without ExtrAvidin adsorption, only plasma incubation, only ExtrAvidin-AP adsorption, and only PNPP incubation all yielded a slope of virtually zero.
</P><P>For a practical example of how significant this distinction is, by the time BioValNHS biotinylation has been reduced to 50% its initial value, 41.9 or 65.9 half-lives have passed for BioNHS and BioCapNHS, respectively, corresponding to 2.44 · 10<SUP>–11</SUP>% or 1.45 · 10<SUP>–18</SUP>% residual biotinylation – i.e. virtually complete debiotinylation. 
</P><P>Notably, the initial slope differs between the three derivatives, with BioCapNHS starting out highest followed by BioNHS and BioValNHS, indicating that the starting biotinylation level was not equal, even though the calibration was aiming to ensure just that. However, the incubation time with NHS reagent before the debiotinylation assay was 5 h instead of 1 h in the concentration series. As established in the latter, the biotinylation efficiency differs between the three derivatives. The concomitant difference in biotinylation rate explains why the significantly longer incubation time entailed non-equal initial slopes: We selected three concentrations to yield the same biotinylation level within 1 h; however, allowing more time entails that the biotinylation reaction can proceed further at the characteristic rates. The results of the concentration series have shown that BioCapNHS achieves higher absolute initial slopes than BioNHS, which in turn surpasses BioValNHS in this respect. Thus, the increased biotinylation time entails that the final biotinylation level will differ between the three derivatives.

In terms of workup, trituration of BioCapNHS proceeded without any problems. However, purification of BioValNHS was encumbered by its unexpectedly good solubility in the recrystallization solvent isopropanol. While a precipitate formed when cooling to 4 °C, this dissolved at once when warming to room temperature, so that the solid residue could not be filtered. Since other amino acid derivatives are reportedly freed from contaminants by washing with diethyl ether, the desired product was precipitated out of the isopropanol solution by adding excess diethyl ether until large white flakes formed. These were isolated, washed with diethyl ether, and dried under high vacuum. 
</P><P>The yield of these two derivatives was significantly less than the 90% achieved for BioNHS. BioCapNHS was afforded in 63% yield, BioValNHS in 41% yield. Apparently the recrystallization step entails more loss compared to BioNHS, which is certainly attributable to the product being better soluble in the case of BioValNHS and, likely, of BioCapNHS as well. Before conducting large-scale syntheses, these purification procedures should be further optimized by choosing a different recrystallization solvent or solvent mixture.
</P><P>Since BioProNHS and BioGlyNHS were impure even after recrystallizing, the yield of these compounds could not be determined reliably. As for BioValNHS and BioCapNHS, recrystallization from isopropanol may not have performed as desired, so that a different solvent should be considered.

Nevertheless, it was puzzling that the NHS ester should have a lower <I>R</I><SUB>f</SUB> than the free carboxylic acid despite being less polar. When using this compound in a biotinidase cleavage assay, its concentration for biotinylation to achieve the same initial slope was 40-fold that of BioNHS; the assay then showed that biotin attached <I>via</I> the putative BioThrNHS was cleaved as fast as that attached <I>via</I> BioNHS. We conclude that the real active biotinylation component in &quot;BioThrNHS&quot; is, in fact, BioNHS as seen in TLC. This leads us to deduce that the main constituent was not, in fact, BioThrNHS. Taking the consistency of the product into account, BioThr to some extent likely polymerized during DCC coupling: the <I>O</I>-acylisourea formed <I>in situ</I> is reactive enough to accept nucleophilic attack by threonine's free hydroxyl group, so that an ester bond is formed between two BioThr molecules. This dimer now still possessing one hydroxyl and one carboxyl group, this reaction may repeat. We find an allusion to undesirable side reactions with biotinyl amino acid derivatives bearing an unprotected hydroxyl function in the work of Wilbur et al.<SUP id="cite_ref-wilbur2006_13-8" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-wilbur2006-13">[13]</A></SUP>, who found that conducting follow-up reactions with biotinylserine at times entailed unwanted side reactions.

If a product is pure, we expect to only see peaks assignable to the target structure and the NMR solvent – and that these peaks have integer-value integrals if setting the integral of one peak to its corresponding number of protons. In BioNHS, for instance, setting the integral of one CH proton in the biotin moiety to 1.00 should entail that the integral of NHS's four equivalent protons equals 4.00, indicating that the compound contains biotin and NHS in stoichiometric amounts as expected. In reality, we must integrate the superimposition of one biotin proton with the NHS peak, so that ideally, an integral of 5.00 results (Figure 11). Subinteger values of either constituent would suggest that only part of the product is the target compound; for instance, if the NHS/biotin superimposition were to integrate to, for instance, 4.50 with reference to the above-mentioned biotin peak, we would infer that the compound contains excess free biotin. 
</P><P>A further advantage is that the <SUP>1</SUP>H spectrum allows us to approximate the proportion of an identified minor component <I>via</I> the ratio of its peak integrals to that of the major compound. Taking the above-mentioned example, the minor component would be free biotin. The NHS/biotin superimposition integral being 4.50, we would infer that the NHS singlet alone should integrate to 3.50 (minus one proton). Since this integral value corresponds to four protons, we would divide by four to obtain an integral of 0.875 per proton with respect to an integral of 1.00 per biotin proton. It would follow that the product comprises 87.5% BioNHS and 12.5% free biotin.
</P><P>In order to further characterize a target compound, a COSY (correlation spectroscopy) spectrum can aid in assigning distinct peak groups to the corresponding protons in the molecule. Briefly, this two-dimensional NMR measurements generally correlates protons separated by three bonds or less, i.e. geminal (attached to the same atom) and vicinal (attached to adjacent framework atoms) protons, and thus allows us to assign peaks in <SUP>1</SUP>H NMR to specific protons with greater confidence.

Interestingly, the two protons attached to the CH<SUB>2</SUB> group next to the sulfur atom appear at different shifts, and COSY shows that they couple with each other. As such, they are not chemically equivalent. Even though in most cases geminal protons are equivalent, non-equivalency is commonly observed in conformationally fixed ring systems. Likewise, biotin’s favored conformation fixes one of these protons in the axial and the other in the equatorial position (Figure 12b),<SUP id="cite_ref-detitta1994_32-0" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-detitta1994-32">[32]</A></SUP> and the permanently different electronic environments conferred by this positional distinction translate into different chemical shifts. The shift assignment to equatorial and axial proton was taken from Bates et al.<SUP id="cite_ref-bates1985_33-0" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-bates1985-33">[33]</A></SUP>. 
Other correlations clearly seen in COSY are those between the protons of (a) the side chain’s first carbon and the ring carbon it is attached to; (b) the position α to the amide carbon and the adjacent aliphatic CH<SUB>2</SUB> group; (c) the position α to the ester carbon and the adjacent aliphatic CH<SUB>2</SUB> group; and (d) the amide nitrogen and the adjacent aliphatic CH<SUB>2</SUB> group. Correlations along the aliphatic chains are difficult to pinpoint since aliphatic protons do not differ much in their electronic environment and thus form a broad multiplet of superimposed peak groups at low shifts. Moreover, correlations across the amide and ester group are not visible because they span more than three bonds.
</P><P>We observe three instances of unexpected coupling behavior: (a) the biotin nitrogen atoms’ protons yield singlets even though they possess vicinal protons. That they fail to couple is especially surprising since the amide nitrogen’s proton distinctly couples with the two vicinal protons (<I>J</I> = 5.7 Hz). This selfsame phenomenon has been addressed in the literature, without gleaning a satisfactory explanation<SUP id="cite_ref-bates1985_33-1" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-bates1985-33">[33]</A></SUP>; (b) the CH<SUB>2</SUB> group next to the amide nitrogen appears as a quartet, even though it should couple with both the amide proton and the adjacent CH<SUB>2</SUB> group to give a triplet of doublets (td) or doublet of triplets (dt), depending on the coupling constants to either of these vicinal protons. Here, we are likely dealing with a superimposition of these multiplicities making for a pseudo quartet; (c) both the equatorial and axial protons of CH<SUB>2</SUB>S give doublets even though they have two coupling partners: the vicinal CH proton as well as each other. However, the latter geminal coupling has <I>J</I> ≈ 1, so that it is not visible in the spectrum at the resolution provided by the 300 MHz spectrometer.

Since this doublet belongs to the six methyl protons, this corresponds to an integral of 0.13 per proton, which matches the excess seen in biotin's peak groups. Notably, according to the literature data, the reference integral of the BioValNHS peak (4.57 ppm) is distinct from any biotinylvaline peaks, so that it only corresponds to BioValNHS. Altogether, this corroborates that the product is a mixture of BioValNHS and biotinylvaline (≈10% judging by peak integral ratios), <I>but not BioNHS</I>. This is important because that the biotinidase-susceptible bond introduced by biotinylation with BioNHS would compromise our measurement results.

</P><P>Interestingly, the two methyl groups of valine give two separate dd peak groups, one for each methyl group coupling with the vicinal proton. This means they are not chemically equivalent. The reason for this is that the isopropyl group is attached to a chiral carbon, so that rotation around this bond can never exactly equalize the electronic environment of one CH<SUB>3</SUB> with the other CH<SUB>3</SUB>', which is apparent from the Newman projection (Figure 13b).

How do we resolve this distinction? It is unlikely that differing propensity to adsorb ExtrAvidin-AP is in play: while biotinylvaline has been reported to have a decreased affinity for avidin, this was in the context of a competition assay against regular biotin.<SUP id="cite_ref-wilbur2006_13-10" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-wilbur2006-13">[13]</A></SUP> In the absence of extraneous biotin, the avidin conjugate should bind even to the biotinylvaline moieties in a virtually quantitative fashion. Thus, the only factors that remain are biotinylation rate and efficiency: if one derivative were to either react more slowly with the protein or be more susceptible to hydrolysis than another, the result would be that biotinylation level increases less with rising reagent concentration or that the saturation curve's horizontal asymptote is at a lower value, respectively. 
</P><P>What differentiates the three derivatives that could cause such changes? The most blatant distinction is steric bulk. BioNHS and BioCapNHS are similar, but the elongated spacer arm of BioCapNHS perhaps makes for more flexibility and thus slightly decreased steric hindrance. However, BioValNHS is significantly more encumbered, since it bears an isopropyl group adjacent to the reactive ester carbon. Steric hindrance in NHS esters resulting in decreased coupling efficiency has been reported in the context of derivatizing a polymer containing primary amines with the NHS ester of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA-NHS): at 50 °C in <I>N</I>,<I>N</I>-dimethylacetamide in the presence of ethyldiisopropylamine (DIPEA) and the nucleophilic catalyst 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), <I>only 5% conversion</I> was achieved within 16 h.<SUP id="cite_ref-hruby2011_34-0" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-hruby2011-34">[34]</A></SUP> The authors argue that, apart from the carboxylate groups of ester and polymer electrostatically repulsing each other, the NHS ester's steric bulk is to blame for this low efficiency. While electrostatics should not apply to our system, the relatively bulky isopropyl group may entail this selfsame reduced coupling efficiency; moreover, the isopropyl group being a σ donor, it may somewhat increase electron density at the reactive carbon and thus render it less electrophilic. The hydrolysis rate may also be elevated relative to the aminolysis rate, seeing as water or hydroxide are much less bulky than a lysine residue attached to protein and thus perhaps suffer less from the increased hindrance around the reactive site.

They assessed debiotinylation by attaching a radioiodinated moiety to the valine's carboxylate function, then incubating with a 1:10 dilution of human serum for 2 h at 37 °C before capturing biotin with streptavidin, so that cleavage of the biotin-valine bond would be expected to entail recovery of only part of the radioactivity. We cannot reliably assess whether the discrepancy of our results with those of Wilbur et al. stems from an assay design or methodical error in our experiment, or is in fact based on our assay using undiluted serum.
</P><P>Whatever is the case, we have successfully shown that chemical synthesis of biotin-NHS derivatives can effectively alter the stability of the thus introduced biotinylation and, by extension, of our cell mesh. Further designs and studies may be able to fully exploit this potential; for instance, introducing several aminocaproic acid moieties between biotin and the NHS ester group might make for a biotinylation reagent that affords super-fast cleavage, and conversely, choosing even more sterically hindered amino acids in place of valine may eventually reveal a fully resistant derivative.

Thus, we researched our NHS esters on <A href="http://www.emolecules.com">emolecules.com</A> to find the same or equivalent compounds in the largest available amount at minimum price with which to compare the pricing of our synthesis, with the following results:
</P><UL><LI>BioNHS: 25 g (73 mmol) at $1,808 (Chem-Impex);</LI><LI>BioCapNHS: 25 g (55 mmol) at $3,000 (Chem-Impex); and</LI><LI>As a biotinidase-resistant equivalent to BioValNHS: (+)-biotinyl 2-aminobutyric acid NHS ester with (CH<SUB>2</SUB>O)<SUB>4</SUB> polyethylene glycol spacer, 1 g (1.5 mmol) at $ 1,200 (Quanta Biotech). 
</LI></UL><P>
Let us first consider BioNHS. We require the following reagents:
</P><UL><LI>(+)-Biotin: 250 g (1.0 mol) at $705 (Chem-Impex);</LI><LI>Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide: 1 kg (4.8 mol) at $60 (Chem-Impex); and</LI><LI><I>N</I>-hydroxysuccinimide: 1 kg (8.7 mol) at $108 (Chem-Impex).</LI></UL><P>
Assuming 90% yield as achieved in our laboratory, we must conduct a 81 mmol batch to obtain 25 g BioNHS. Taking into account the synthesis stoichiometry, we calculate $56 for biotin (81 mmol), $1.30 for DCC (105.3 mmol), and $1.21 (97.2 mmol) for NHS. Additionally, we require the solvent <I>N</I>,<I>N</I>-dimethylformamide, available for $90 per 10 L (Chem-Impex) at 3 mL g<SUP>–1</SUP> biotin, i.e. 600 mL worth $5.40. We will assume the solvent cost to be $10 because it must be dried prior to use, but we do not expect the cost of self-dried solvent to exceed this value; the necessary 3 Å molecular sieves (for instance 3–5 mm beads at $88 per 1 kg, Alfa Aesar) are not overly expensive, are not needed in great amounts (5% w/v being sufficient<SUP id="cite_ref-burfield1978_35-0" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-burfield1978-35">[35]</A></SUP>, i.e. 500 g per 10 L), and can be re-activated and thus reused many times. Alternatively, we can acquire commercial anhydrous DMF, e.g. 4 L at $248 (Alfa Aesar), which translates to $40 in this 81 mmol batch. What remains is the purification step, for which we will assume $5 at maximum for the cost of recrystallization solvent isopropanol as well as heating and filtration material. In total: ≈ $65 using self-dried DMF, and ≈ $95 for commercial anhydrous DMF. This makes for 4% or 5%, respectively of the expenses of the commercially available BioNHS.
</P><P>Continuing with BioCapNHS, we will assume 85% yield in the first step (peptide coupling) and 70% in the second (NHS ester synthesis); these numbers are somewhat higher than achieved here, but after optimizing the purification procedures, most importantly the solvent used in recrystallizing the NHS ester, we expect them to increase. To obtain 25 g of the compound, we must thus conduct the first step with 92 mmol BioNHS to obtain 79 mmol of BioCap, which then yields the target 55 mmol in the second step. 
For the first step, we need:
</P><UL><LI>BioNHS, assuming synthesis with self-dried solvent: $65 per 73 mmol;</LI><LI>Aminocaproic acid, available at $114 per 1 kg (7.6 mol) (Chem-Impex); and</LI><LI>Triethylamine, available at $80 per 4 L (2.904 kg, 29 mol) (Chem-Impex).</LI></UL><P>
Calculating with the necessary stoichiometry, we obtain $82 for BioNHS (92 mmol), $1.50 for aminocaproic acid (101 mmol), $1 for triethylamine (184 mmol) and $2.30 for DMF, which need not be dry. We will assume $1 for the purification, which only contains washing with water and the necessary filtering material. This amounts to ≈ $90. With the resultant 79 mmol BioCap, we can assume the same costs as for synthesizing BioNHS (81 mmol) above with self-dried DMF, substituting BioCap for biotin to get $12, set to $30 because more DMF may be necessary for less soluble derivatives. In total: $120, which is equivalent to 4% of the commercial product's price.
</P><P>With other amino acid derivatives, much the same calculation is true as for BioCapNHS, except for the price of the starting material amino acid. The price of L-amino acid ranges from $30 (glycine) to $125 (proline) (Chem-Impex); thus, they are on average less expensive than aminocaproic acid. L-Valine, for instance, is available at $80 per 1 kg. Even assuming the same price as for BioCapNHS, this is only $6 per 1.5 mmol to better compare with the biotinyl 2-aminobutyric acid derivative's package size, corresponding to only 0.5% of the commercial product's cost.
</P><P>In conclusion, the syntheses conducted here afford the necessary compounds for biotinylation in our bioprinting system at much lower cost than available commercially. The price per gram of BioNHS amounts to $2.60 if using self-dried DMF or $3.80 if using commercial anhydrous DMF. Biotinyl amino acid derivatives, including that of aminocaproic acid, are available at approximately $4.80 per gram.

For the concentration series, solutions were prepared for the maximum concentration (100 μM for BioNHS and BioCapNHS, 200 μM for BioValNHS); the series was subsequently prepared in a separate 96-well plate by transferring half (200 μL) of the vigorously mixed solution in one well to the next well’s PBS (200 μL) across 12 columns, discarding 200 μL of the last to obtain 200 μL in each well.

If not directly used, the plate were stored dry at 4 °C.

The plate was then washed with PBS-T 0.1 (3×200 μL per well). Subsequently, the well was incubated with ExtrAvidin-Alkaline Phosphatase (ExtrAvidin-AP; 1:2,000 dilution of 15.2 μM) in AP buffer (100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl<SUB>2</SUB>) for 30 min followed by washing with PBS-T 0.1 (3×100 μL per well). The activity of bound ExtrAvidin-AP, and thus the biotinylation level, was evaluated by adding <I>p</I>-nitrophenyl phosphate (0.5 mg mL<SUP>–1</SUP> sodium salt hexahydrate in AP buffer) and measuring the absorbance increase at wavelength 405 nm, corresponding to generation of <I>p</I>-nitrophenol by the action of AP, in increments of 20 s for 10 min.
