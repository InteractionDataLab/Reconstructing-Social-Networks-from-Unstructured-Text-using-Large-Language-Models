Although iGEM is an open source competition that does not in itself focus on business creation, it begs to question what the possibilities could be if it did. Entrepreneurship uses the market to find a problem and solve it. By using business methods as a scaling method, biotechnology can provide solutions for a larger variety of problems and to a greater number of people. In sum, biotech entrepreneurship is a mechanism for spreading good ideas and making useful products available to those that need them. 
</P><P>Furthermore, understanding enabling factors in biotech entrepreneurship can help bring awareness to biotech and promote entrepreneurship for iGEM participants and scientists everywhere. Therefore, the aim of this research is to establish the most significant enabling factors in relation to biotech and synthetic biology (SynBio). From there, future steps can be made to promote entrepreneurship in the scientific realm.
</P><P>The analysis will begin with a presentation of the hypothesis, research model and objectives. The next sections provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the research. The concluding sections involve a list of suggestions and next-steps on how the data can be used for entrepreneurship. 
</P></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Research_Question.2C_Research_Objective_and_Research_Design">Research Question, Research Objective and Research Design</SPAN></H1><DIV class="white-box"><P>Our theory holds that if certain enabling factors exist for biotech business creation and success, then biotech businesses will be founded. If this is true, then further research is needed to understand the enabling factors in biotech entrepreneurship in order to further promote its success. We assume that the factors that facilitate business creation and biotech innovation also extend to the realm of biotech entrepreneurship.
</P><P>Research Objective 1: Establishing a theoretically grounded framework to understand the enabling factors that facilitate entrepreneurship in biotechnology. 
</P><P>Research Objective 2: Substantiate the theoretical framework and investigate the motives, barriers and decision criteria that leads to business creation in biotechnology and SynBio. 
</P><P>Research Objective 3: Establish the most important factors that lead to or prevent business creation in biotechnology and synthetic biology within the context of iGEM.
</P></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Research_Model">Research Model</SPAN></H1><DIV class="white-box"><P>To answer the objectives, this research draws on a combined multi-method empirical study, linking a qualitative and quantitative approach to understand entrepreneurship in biotechnology and SynBio. By combining qualitative and quantitative data, the research benefits from the advantages of both approaches. Qualitative data can capture the causal process of a certain phenomenon and substantiate the hypothesis derived from literature in order to answer research questions behind the enabling factors in biotechnology entrepreneurship <SUP id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-1">[1]</A></SUP>. On the other hand, quantitative data allows testing on a large scale as a greater spectrum of observations can be tested. This strategic combination will create a better understanding of significant factors in biotech entrepreneurship. 
</P><P>The next sections will establish 1) the background research used to develop the theory and structure the data collection, including literature and advising, 2) a qualitative research approach, 3) a quantitative research approach, 4) an analysis of the combined qualitative and quantitative data, a 5) a conclusion and discussion regarding enabling factors in biotech plus 6) suggestions for the biotech industry and iGEM to enable more scientists to found a company.

The advisors included academic advisors and professors in synthetic biology, representatives of BioM (the biotech cluster in Munich, Germany), entrepreneurial advisors from the startup accelerator TechFounders and current and past participants of iGEM. All of these advisors contributed to the research methodology as well as the quantitative survey and qualitative interview design.
</P><P>
Research Approach
</P><P>First, 11 of qualitative interviews were held to better understand the factors that affected Founders and non-Founders from the iGEM population. Second, a quantitative survey was designed to analyze the significance of different variables in business creation in biotech (specifically in iGEM). From the survey a statistical analysis was performed to measure the degree to which the variables affected founding a business. 
</P><P>The survey analyzes current and past iGEM participants, who are working in relatively the same, with similar education levels, time frames and resources.
</P></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Potential_Limitations_of_the_Data">Potential Limitations of the Data</SPAN></H1><DIV class="white-box"><P>Although the sample size (n = 140) is decent for data analysis, a larger sample size could potentially provide better results. Furthermore, as there were only a handful of business founded from iGEM (less than 20), the sample size of Founders from iGEM remains small due to this limitation. However, this only strengthens the reasoning for conducting research on this topic, to understand why so few teams have founded businesses and what can be improved to make it more common in the future.
</P></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Qualitative_Data_Approach">Qualitative Data Approach</SPAN></H1><DIV class="white-box"><P>For the qualitative data, 12 past iGEM participants were interviewed, 4 of which founded a business (Founders) and 8 who had not (non-Founders). The goal of the interviews was to understand the Founders/non-Founders decision process and the factors that influenced or barred the way to business founding. The chapter is organized 1) a list of interviews with Founders, 2) a table of the core questions and responses from the Founders, 3) a list of interviews with non-Founders and 4) a table of the core questions and responses from the non-Founders.

While none of the reasons mentioned in Table 4 are not necessarily more significant than others, there is a general trend.  First, the teams all shared a similarity of being highly ambitious in finding funding through external sources (accelerators, banks, sponsors), as well as having a large passion for their projects, sometimes even deferring their studies. Second, the teams expressed having a quality team was useful for a successful business. Third, the teams differed slightly on how much knowledge exchange they had with industry partners during their iGEM; however, once business creation became an idea the teams heavily sought out expert advising in entrepreneurship and from industry experts. Interestingly, some of the teams were not aware of their product’s advantage until later in iGEM and many had no idea about the market characteristics until they sought out industry/entrepreneurship consulting. Overall, the storyline seems that the iGEM teams found a useful idea, developed it during iGEM with quality mentorship, came to find that they required more funding and business advising to make the product viable and worked hard to secure resources to found a startup. 
</P><P>The Founders also gave their thoughts in regards to entrepreneurship in biotech, suggesting that 1) today it is easier than ever before to found a biotech company, because funding and resources are much more accessible and 2) iGEM is definitely an enabling factor. These suggestions will be discussed later on in the “Suggestions and Conclusion” section. 
</P><P>It is important to have both sides of the story. Therefore, the next section is a list of the interviews with non-Founders and the reasons they did not found a business from their iGEM projects.

In general, the teams had a lack of knowledge exchange and consulting with mentors. If there was industry consultation, it was primarily in the form of sponsorship. Furthermore, teams had hardly any entrepreneurial consulting and many of the teams did not even consider a business, either due to not having the skills or experience, a marketable product, time and motivation, and/or the encouragement to further their project/consider a business. A common theme was the lack of time due to the need to finish academics or continue into a research-oriented position. 
</P><P>One notable difference among the non-founding teams was the amount of funding and resources. Some teams had quite a lot of funding/resources while others had to get by with less. They also had mixed responses regarding the quality/quantity of academic mentors. 
</P><P>In general, it seems that the teams varied on funding/resources/academic mentorship but were very similar in lacking knowledge exchange with industry experts and entrepreneurship mentors. A definite theme was having a lack of time and motivation with academics in the way. 
</P><P>The non-Founders provided very interesting ideas to encourage entrepreneurship in biotech, including 1) increasing interaction and knowledge exchange with industry members 2) providing incentive for business creation, including a) inviting investors/accelerators/incubators to iGEM, b) creating an entrepreneurship track, c) providing job opportunities with industry members, d) encouraging entrepreneurship in the life sciences, 3) encouraging iGEM participants to solve a real-world problem/seek market opportunities and 4) establish more incubators that provide the resources and advising for people to realize their projects. These suggestions will be further discussed further in the “Suggestions and Conclusion” section later on.
</P></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Summary_and_Discussion_of_Qualitative_Data">Summary and Discussion of Qualitative Data</SPAN></H1><DIV class="white-box"><P>The founding and non-founding teams had many differences and a few similarities between them. First, there is a large difference between the two groups and the amount of knowledge exchange and consultation that occurred. The Founding teams had far more knowledge exchange with experts and entrepreneurship advisors than the non-founding teams. 
</P><P>Second, the time and motivation between teams was highly varied. Some teams did not think the project was worth the time and/or their studies were in the way. Although finishing studies was a concern for both groups, the founding teams had either finished their studies or deferred them to make time for a startup. Some of the founders even went into business studies after finishing their science degrees to help their businesses. 
</P><P>Third, the founding teams’ ambitions pushed them to secure funding/consulting for their projects and business aspirations. Although some of the non-Founding teams did have decent funding, they did not use the resources for business creation. 
</P><P>One similarity among the founders and non-founders was the general lack of business experience or skills. Hardly any of the teams had previous experience in business and only a few had dabbled in the idea of founding before iGEM. This shows that not having previous business skills does not have to be a barrier to business creation. The founding teams sought out entrepreneurship consulting and learned on the way while building their products. 
</P><P>In conclusion, the results of the Founder and non-Founder interviews provide interesting insights into the factors that enable biotechnology entrepreneurship in iGEM. The next section uses a quantitative method approach to assess to which degree these factors truly influence founding a business.
</P></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Quantitative_Data_Approach">Quantitative Data Approach</SPAN></H1><DIV class="white-box"><P>The quantitative data survey is based upon the 11 established paradigms of business creation, plus added questions to address the specifics of biotech and iGEM. The survey has 60 questions with 140 responses and was conducted between August 26th, 2016 and October 20th, 2016 with SurveyMonkey via social media and contacting current/past iGEMers via email. The majority of the questions were structured as likert scales (1-7 rating) as well as optional open answer questions. 
</P><P>The survey was pretested in order to check for understandability, clarification needs, and accuracy of the questions as well as the comprehensiveness of the survey and the time needed to answer its questions <SUP id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-3">[3]</A></SUP>. The pretest was conducted with academic peers, interview partners of the case study, biotechnology clusters/companies, professors and entrepreneurship consultants. The reviews from academic peers, biotech professionals and consultants also included feedback on phrasing, presentation, and the structure of the questions. 
</P><P>From the survey data, logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship of the established enabling variables in biotech business creation. The following sections will begin with 1) regressions based upon the established paradigms of business creation and biotechnology/iGEM, 2) a full model regression containing variables that had a 10% significance in direct relation to our dependent variable (dependent variable = Founder), 3) t-tests to analyze differences between the Founder population and non-Founder population, 4) a summary of the open answer responses and finally 5) a discussion and summary of the data.

</P><P>A logit regression analysis was used to analyze the most significant team factors in founding a business from iGEM. In this case, the team entrepreneurial spirit and team functionality were both highly significant with p = 0.00 and 0.076, respectively. Interestingly, while it makes sense that having an entrepreneurial spirit is positively correlated with founding a business, team functionality has a negative effect with a coefficient of -0.445! This is surprising as often team functionality plays a large part in project success. Perhaps this means the team splintered off into different groups, where only some team members founded a business independent of the rest. This is evident from the survey and graph as well, showing only a few people from the original teams founded the business. From the qualitative interviews, some teams did in fact only found with a few members of the original iGEM team. Without more information on this data, however, it is hard to make accurate assumptions on why team functionality does not enable business creation in this case. On the other hand, having an entrepreneurial spirit in the team has an extremely significant relationship of ß = 0.00, with all other variables held constant, meaning the drive and motivation to found a startup enables biotech business creation. Judging from the qualitative interviews, it certainly appears true that entrepreneurial spirit played a role as the founding teams were passionate and worked hard to secure funding and resources to found a business.

This implies the Founders were relatively aware of or stumbled upon a market opportunity with their iGEM project and were able to access the market in time to found a viable business. From the qualitative interviews, some of the founders either knew during their project development that there was market growth, or only after the iGEM competition. Either way, it is clear that market growth related to a business is beneficial to founding a startup and so conducting research on the marketability of an idea could be beneficial when choosing an iGEM project.

This suggests the iGEM teams that built startups were either highly influenced or attained success partially because of consulting with business/entrepreneurship advisors. Furthermore, it is apparent that founding teams in the interviews had entrepreneurship consulting, either from their mentors or from accelerators and incubators. Therefore, it can be concluded that having an entrepreneurship mentor can highly influence its founding.
</P></DIV><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="4._Access_to_Resources_and_Product_Development">4. Access to Resources and Product Development</SPAN></H2><DIV class="white-box"><P>Regressing the variables concerning enough resources, enough time and enough advising provided no significant results at the 10% level (p ≤ .10). Although potentially significant, the survey data did not provide a reliable relationship between founding business and these variables. However, taking data from the qualitative interviews, the founding teams in general did not have enough funding/resources for startup creation during iGEM and therefore either 1) received money and resources from accelerators/incubators or 2) took out bank loans 3) gained sponsorship from other companies and universities. Furthermore, some non-founding teams did have decent funding but did not use it for business founding. So while funding, time and resources do not show a reliable relationship from the quantitative data, the qualitative data shows ambitious teams sought out and secured the resources they needed, enabling them to found a business.

</P><P>Access and use of customer feedback is also highly significant with a p-value of 0.001 and a positive coefficient of 0.527, all other variables held constant. This makes sense as customer feedback is very important in business creation as it directly addresses a customer’s problem, which enables the business to then build a product that solves it, developing into a viable business. Furthermore, customer feedback allows project developers to tweak the product according to changes in trends and customer needs, enabling greater product viability. However, judging from the graph, the survey respondents in general had hardly any customer feedback. This could present an area of improvement for iGEM and iGEM teams for making more successful projects and possibly businesses.

This can be interpreted to mean founding iGEM teams are 1) aware of government funding and can therefore take the opportunity to secure financial support, 2) are highly motivated and are seeking funding from sources outside of the university/iGEM and/or 3) are provided this information from mentors or other sources to support project development. As previously mentioned, the interviewees were very active in finding funding sources, some of which used accelerators and other sponsors.

The variables represent the need/interest in legal advice, having an interest to patent and the ability to patent during iGEM project development. The need for legal advice and having a patent interest show a positive and significant relationship to founding a business (ß = 0.404 and p = 0.030, ß = 0.411 and p = 0.044, respectively). This signifies that 1) Founders are in need of legal advice because of their interest to found a business, 2) the product could require patenting to be viable and/or 3) understanding how to secure a proper patent is difficult. 
</P><P>On the other hand, patenting during the iGEM project development shows a negative relationship of -0.417 and p = 0.73, all variables being held constant. This negative relationship with founding implies a barrier to patent a product during iGEM. Such a barrier would explain why some teams have difficulty founding businesses during iGEM project development. 
</P><P>Many of the founding teams interviewed did receive legal advising from their accelerators or mentors. Only a few needed to patent, and some are still in the middle of filing for a patent. The qualitative results are mixed on needing patents to have a viable product; however, it is clear that there is a lack of legal understanding and a need to provide iGEM teams with better legal knowledge and training, if the need were to arise.

Another significant factor regarding biotechnology clusters and industry support is the variable knowledge exchange with a high significance of p = 0.00 and a positive coefficient of .653, all variables being held constant. This significant and positive relationship implies interaction with biotech clusters and/or industry members is highly influential for biotech business creation, as it likely provides 1) expert insight into problems that need solving, 2) knowledge in scientific processes, 3) knowledge in business processes and/or 4) market information important for successful business creation. From the qualitative data it is clear that most of the founding teams consulted industry experts regarding their projects and business consideration. The non-Founding teams had noticeably less interaction with industry representatives. Although founding has a clear relationship with knowledge exchange, it is clear from the survey respondents that only a few iGEM teams actually collaborated with other entities and exchanged knowledge. Therefore, it appears extremely important for iGEM teams considering founding (or for iGEM success) to have knowledge exchange.

</P><P>In regards to building the business model of an iGEM project, having a business plan is extremely significant with p = 0.00 and a positive coefficient of 3.07, all variables held constant. Clearly, having a business plan greatly improves the chances of an iGEM team founding. However, as seen in the graph, very few teams in iGEM actually make a business plan. The qualitative data also suggests that founding teams created a business plan during iGEM. Therefore, it can be concluded that a business plan enables iGEM teams in business founding.

As shown in the data, having a successful Proof of Concept at iGEM is positively related to founding a business, with a p = 0.16 and a positive coefficient of 0.698, all variables held constant. This makes sense, as proving an idea at iGEM means potential for credibility in the real world as well. If the concept is proven and there is a market opportunity, then likely there is startup potential. In general, all of the interviewed founding teams had relatively successful Proofs of Concept. Overall, this means that really having a proven idea could lead to startup creation.

</P></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Summary_and_Discussion_of_Quantitative_Data">Summary and Discussion of Quantitative Data</SPAN></H1><DIV class="white-box"><P>In sum, the significant quantitative variables (p ≤ .10) on iGEM business creation were 1) access to customer feedback, 2) knowledge exchange with industry, 3) a team entrepreneurial spirit, 4) product market growth 5) having entrepreneurship consulting, 6) awareness of government funding, 7) an interest in legal advice 8) an interest in patenting and 9) having a successful Proof of Concept for the iGEM project. The most significant negative variables (p ≤ .10) are 1) team functionality and 2) the inability to patent during iGEM project development. 
</P><P>Similar to the qualitative data, founding teams used much more knowledge exchange and entrepreneurial consulting, and had an entrepreneurial drive that made them more aware of funding opportunities, market growth and legal issues. 
</P><P>The most interesting factors are the degree to which knowledge exchange and mentorship were so crucial in supporting iGEM entrepreneurs. Industry interaction and proper guidance for the project and business played a heavy role in developing a marketable product, securing funding, understanding patents and being aware of market opportunities. 
</P><P>It is surprising that team functionality did not play a larger role in the statistics. Team quality and cohesiveness is often quoted to be one of the most significant factors for startups; however, in the case if iGEM it seems to be a negative influence. This could also stem from the fact that so many teams are very large (e.g. over 20 people), and often startups begin with much fewer people. This means teams likely split up after iGEM and only a few continued the business, as seen in the qualitative interviews. 
</P><P>The following sections will dive a little more deeply on Founder and non-Founder differences, as well as a look at the combined qualitative and quantitative data to better understand biotech entrepreneurship enabling factors. 
</P></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Population_Differences_Between_Founders_and_non-Founders">Population Differences Between Founders and non-Founders</SPAN></H1><DIV class="white-box"><P>To further understand the enabling factors in biotech entrepreneurship, independent samples t-tests were conducted to compare population differences between Founders and non-Founders. More specifically, research was done to understand population differences in the degree of 1) entrepreneurship consulting, 2) advising and 3) cluster support. These variables were chosen because of their significance in the previous regressions and the emphasis the interviewees put on these factors. Understanding differences in Founder and non-Founder characteristics provides further insight into enabling factors in biotech.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="1._T-Test_Entrepreneurship_Consulting">1. T-Test Entrepreneurship Consulting</SPAN></H2><P>The first t-test examined if having more (or any) entrepreneurship consulting was significant in founding a startup from iGEM. Having access to Entrepreneurship consulting proves yet again to be a very influential variable in business creation. There was a significant difference between the Founders (M = 4.07, SD = 2.21) and non-Founder (M = 1.74, SD = 1.33), conditions; t(138) = -5.56 and p = 0.00. This data completely rejects the null hypothesis and suggests Founders are much different than non-Founders in either having access to and/or effectively using entrepreneurship consulting to found. 
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="2._T-Test:_Advising">2. T-Test: Advising</SPAN></H2><P>There was a significant difference between Founders having enough advising (M = 5.53, SD = 1.51) and non-Founders having enough advising (M = 4.74, SD = .146), conditions; t(138) = -1.67, p = 0.097. In line with entrepreneurship consulting, having enough advising is significantly more apparent in the Founder population than non-Founder population. This means enough advising (in academia, science, business creation, etc.) enables iGEM teams to found businesses. 
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="3._T-Test:_Cluster_Support">3. T-Test: Cluster Support</SPAN></H2><P>There was a significant difference between the Founder cluster support (M = 3.61, SD = .55) and the non-Founder cluster support (M = 2.77, SD = .146) conditions; t(138) = -1.71, p = 0.089. This implies Founders had greater support from their region and/or industry members regarding their iGEM projects, leading to startup founding success. 
</P></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Summary_and_Discussion_of_T-Tests">Summary and Discussion of T-Tests</SPAN></H1><DIV class="white-box"><P>The t-tests represent differences in Founder and non-Founder population resources that could partially explain why some teams founded and others did not. The Founders had clear advantages in entrepreneurship consulting, general advising and cluster support. This implies that the interaction with advisors and industry experts provided the knowledge Founders needed to found their businesses. Therefore, proper advising and cluster support is highly influential in iGEM team business creation.

For example, it would be useful to investigate VCs and accelerators interested in SynBio and incorporate them into the iGEM environment. Perhaps partnerships with established companies could be made to increase knowledge and technology exchange. Entrepreneurship consultants could provide training and advising for iGEM teams. Additionally, scientists need to be inspired and aware of the possibilities of founding companies from their research. These initiatives could be simultaneously progressed as the interest and knowledge in SynBio grows and innovation clusters are formed. 
</P><P>Helmut Schönenberger, CEO of UnternehmerTUM center of Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Munich, is an expert on building a clusters of innovation and believes it would highly benefit SynBio initiatives. According to the seasoned entrepreneur, building an ecosystem of partnerships, mentorships and inspiration for startups creates synergies that push startup potential. Today, clusters of entrepreneurship for Synbio are just at their beginnings, therefore these ecosystems need to be fostered by connecting large companies, startups, VCs and every interested party to build an effective support system for SynBio innovation. Furthermore, teaching entrepreneurship already has established methods - the problem is reaching scientists and showing them the possibilities in entrepreneurship. By creating a SynBio entrepreneurial ecosystem, which iGEM is partially doing, you create a wealth of synergies that promote SynBio startup creation and the SynBio industry overall (Schönenberger 2016). 
</P><P>Promoting these enabling factors and webbing a supportive ecosystem for Synbio is key to entrepreneurship and the SynBio community. Many improvements need to be made to provide scientists with the tools, mentorship, encouragement and business opportunities. The possibilities are there and growing, iGEM and scientists around the globe need only to seize the opportunity.
