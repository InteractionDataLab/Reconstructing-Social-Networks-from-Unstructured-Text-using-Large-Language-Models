are an important point of any iGEM project as it is necessary to put the results obtained by the team into the context of individual responsibilities. Thus, we will attempt to candidly describe how our project evolved, which student was responsible for which sub-project, and who supported our project with scientific or non-scientific contributions.
</P></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Finding_the_biotINK_project">Finding the biotINK project</SPAN></H1><DIV class="white-box"><P>For the story of finding our project, it is essential to know that there was no iGEM team from either TUM or LMU in 2015 and no team at TUM in 2014. Thus, each of these years saw students wanting to participate in the iGEM competition but facing the bleak perspective that there was no hosting lab that offered the support necessary to make the &quot;iGEM experience&quot;. For this long a time, students have brainstormed in order to find interesting ideas that they could convert into an iGEM project. Likewise, the idea for our bioprinting project is far older than just this year – at least in theory. The life science students finally assembled around last February, eagerly suggesting various ideas for several promising potential iGEM projects that they had in mind. The project ideas that were developed most involved i) transforming the planet Mars with bacteria, ii) creating a vegan substitution product for milk, and iii) bioprinting. While we considered the bioprinting project to be the most intriguing idea, <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:TU_Delft">last year's TU Delft iGEM team</A> had unfortunately already developed an excellent project on bioprinting. Thus began a long discussion of whether it would be in our team's best interests to participate with another bioprinting project. In the end, however, we agreed that the next years of iGEM will most likely witness the establishment of a separate bioprinting track and that this topic has extraordinary potential. By the way, it was much encouraging to listen to Randy in Paris when he described the potential of SynBio and chose bioprinting of organs for an example! At this point, our last doubts melted, and we were wholly confident that our project choice was just right.
</P></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Our_principal_investigators_.28PIs.29">Our principal investigators (PIs)</SPAN></H1><DIV class="white-box"><P>As implied above, it was very difficult to convince a professor at TUM of an iGEM participation, and at LMU as well it was cumbersome to find a PI enthusiastic about iGEM now that Prof. Mascher has left Munich. The initial motivation to found this year's iGEM team was sparked by the Graduate Center GRK 2062: Molecular principles of synthetic biology, which desired to re-establish the iGEM competition in Munich. 
</P><UL><LI><B>Prof. Dr. Jung </B>(one of our secondary PIs, LMU) is the head of this graduate center and thus impulsed the creation of a team by recruiting students. Wanting to share the project she (and the GRK) looked for a lab participating in the graduate center that could host the iGEM team as main lab. During the summer we had access to lab space in her department, where we could perform cloning  steps and other work. This was of great help, as the distance between LMU and TUM at Weihenstephan Campus is more than 2 h with public transportation. We are grateful for Prof. Jung's support even though towards the end we decided to rejoin into our main lab. </LI><LI><B>Prof. Dr. Skerra</B> (our main PI, TUM) already filled the role of the main PI of TUM's 2012 and 2013 iGEM teams and thus had the first-hand experience of what it means to host an iGEM team. Initially, he was disinclined to host yet another iGEM team at his lab, but finally we could convince him of this. He is a renowned expert in the field of protein design, especially for therapeutic proteins, and has also founded two successful companies. For this reason, he is quite busy and unable invest great amounts of time in the iGEM competition. He joined our weekly team meeting once after we had decided on our project, giving us several invaluable tips concerning what components to integrate and what aspects to focus on in order to arrive at a proof of principle in the end. Apart from this session with him, it is his philosophy that iGEM is a student's  competition and that the students themselves should design and create the project. He generously offered all of the resources available at his chair together with the excellent analytical equipment, while letting us free rein to plan and execute the project on our own – and we are very grateful that he provided us with this opportunity!</LI><LI><B>Prof. Dr. Westmeyer </B>(secondary PI, TUM, Helmholtz center) was asked to join the team halfway through the project when we realized that we required his expertise in the field of fluorescence microscopic imaging. He supported us, especially in the final weeks, with cell-biological reagents for staining and transfection as well as with the analytical instrumentation of his lab. As he spent the last years in Boston at the MIT and at Harvard, he is very open-minded concerning the potential and possible applications of SynBio in the future.</LI></UL></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Our_Journey_Through_Munich">Our Journey Through Munich</SPAN></H1><DIV class="white-box"><P>In the course of our project, we have met many nice people willing to help and support us with lab space, knowledge, or materials.

Instructors assisted the students in planning their experiments, introducing relevant molecular-biological and chemical techniques to the students when they performed a specific experiment for the first time. Moreover, the students evaluated the experiments themselves after an introduction to the theory and advice on what to do and what to avoid. After this preliminary evaluation, all data were accumulated and discussed in the weekly team meeting, at which our two instructors Andreas and Volker (both PhD students at the lab of Prof. Skerra) were present to reflect on our project. Here we enumerate the specific tasks as well as the student(s) who performed them in order to allow the judges to directly contact the student responsible for a topic of interest.

Shaker flask productions were conducted independently of other lab members; for fermentation (which turned out to be a somewhat more difficult than explained in lectures), one of our instuctors had an eye on the whole production.
Purification with normal columns was performed independently; for those involving the Äkta purifier, a lab member supervised our handling for the first 3 to 5 chromatographies.
