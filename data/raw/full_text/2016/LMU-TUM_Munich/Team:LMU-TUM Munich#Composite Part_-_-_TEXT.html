Featured Composite Part:
TetR-TetO-OmpA ( BBa_K2170141 ):
The experimental controle over the gene expression of a specific gene can be essential when you are working with microorganisms. This is the reason why we tested the BioBrick BBa_I739001 of ETHZ 2007 for functionality and added a tetracycline operator as well as an OmpA signal peptide, which imparts the SEC-dependent secretion of the downstream protein. The construct was tested using a testing device BBa_K2170053 whose secretion efficiency could be tested by NanoGlo assay.
Biotinylated receptor with BAP ( BBa_K2170000 )
Our BioBrick BBa_K2170000 contains an eucaryotic receptor construct with an biotin acceptor peptide, which, after expression in an eucaryotic cell, imparts the binding of streptavidin on the cell surface. This constucts makes it possible to link cells with a biotin binding protein and by this makes the printing of tissue without scaffold even possible.
Biotin binding receptor with eMA ( BBa_K2170001 )
Our BioBrick BBa_K2170001 contains an eucaryotic receptor construct with enhanced monomeric avidin, which, after expression in an eucaryotic cell, imparts the binding of biotin on the cell surface. This constucts makes it possible to link cells over a biotinylated protein linker and by this makes the printing of tissue without scaffold even possible.
Biotin binding receptor with scAvidin ( BBa_K2170002 )
Our BioBrick BBa_K2170002 contain an eucaryotic biotin binding receptor with the tetrameric biotin binding protein single chain avidin. As it's sibling BioBrick BBa_K2170001 it imparts the polymerization of cells, after transfection, because of the ability to bind biotinylated protein linkers.
Composite Parts we improved:
GMK_TK90 "Kill-Switch": BBa_K404113 & BBa_K782063 were improved as both parts were wrong as they both contained a forbidden PstI restriction site that made it impossible to ligate BioBricks downstream of the BioBrick. A corrected BioBrick was provided ( BBa_K2170060 )
