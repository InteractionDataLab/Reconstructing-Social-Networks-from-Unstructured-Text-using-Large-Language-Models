When they told us that they were using the human <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCN2">Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2)</A> in order to detect the siderophores of pathogenic bacteria, we came up with the idea that we could provide the team with highly pure Lcn2 protein. This was a fruitful collaboration as our team's main PI, Prof. Dr. Arne Skerra, is one of the leading experts in the field of lipocalins<SUP id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-1">[1]</A></SUP>. For this reason, the expression constructs and the protocols to produce this recombinant protein are well established our affiliated lab. The main challenge in producing the recombinant protein was that the Sheffield iGEM team required the apo form of the protein without the bacterial siderophore as they aimed to scavenge siderophores from samples and then determine the siderophore content. Thus, we produced the recombinant protein in <I>E. coli</I> such that it was free from the siderophore generated in conventional <I>E. coli</I> strains.

We saw their presentation at the iGEM Germany meet-up in Marburg, and as we used the purified recombinant eGFP for our own project in any case, we proposed to provide them with eGFP for their experiments. Luckily, at the &quot;Biotechnikum&quot; of the TUM, an annual lab course for bioprocess engineering students produces a large batch of eGFP in <I>E. coli</I> at a bioprocess scale of several hundred liters of culture medium. For our project, we were provided with ≈50 g of eGFP that we subsequently purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation as well as immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), and eventually dialyzed the protein against PBS. At the beginning of October, we provided 1.4 g of purified eGFP to the <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:FAU_Erlangen%7C">FAU Erlangen</A> iGEM team.

Our syringe pump was proven to work well in our lab and it can be built with an investment of less than 50 USD provided an off-the-shelf 3D printer is available. For the beta test, the Darmstadt team received only the files for the 3D prints as well as all the parts (such as a stepper motor, few screws, some end-stop switches and the necessary wiring).
</P><P>Here is their feedback from after they assembled our syringe pump:
</P><P><I><B>&quot;</B>The pump is neat and stable. The idea of using buttons as end stops is, in principle, good. You took the necessary holes into account and we were able to assemble it according to the instructions.</I><I>The click system for the syringe was well made and worked straightaway. The linear bearing could be used right away as well.</I><I>We utilized a homemade 3D printer on highest gear for printing the parts. As you might know, this leads to relatively many &quot;aberrations&quot; and errors in the prints. They made the assembly difficult and we had to post-process several of them.</I></P><DIV class="imagelink float-left"><A href="/wiki/images/d/de/Muc16_Collaboration_syringe_pump2.png" class="internal" title="Muc16 Collaboration syringe pump2.png">Media:Muc16_Collaboration_syringe_pump2.png</A></DIV><P>Your construction is designed quite closed, which renders it difficult for any passionate tinkerer to make adaptations after the printing. For instance, we noted that you had sent us a printed clutch though the stepper motor was not shortened and did not fit. Therefore, we drilled a hole in the front, enlarged the clutch and glued the parts together.
<I>In general, there are different stepper motors in use in the DIY community; hence, we suggest to conceptualize a more general clutch to ease this problem.</I><I>Furthermore, the suspension device for the syringe could be improved, though the varying design of DIY printers makes finding a &quot;good&quot; solution rather difficult.<B>&quot;</B></I></P></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Meeting_the_iGEM_community">Meeting the iGEM community</SPAN></H1><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="The_European_Experience.2C_Paris_July_2nd_to_3rd">The European Experience, Paris July 2nd to 3rd</SPAN></H2><DIV class="white-box"><P>The first big journey for our team lead us all the way to Paris, France.

Early morning, we headed to the event location. First objective: <B>COFFEE</B>,

It was great to see all those ideas and of course to be able to showcase our own bioprinting project ourselves. We also obtained helpful tips and hints.
After the poster sessions was over and nutrition had been taken care of, interesting panels on ethics and entrepreneurship in synthetic biology followed before it was time for Randy to drop some final Brexit jokes and conclude the scientific section of the event.

After this sweat-breaking, super-tight, overly nerve-wracking game was finally over, with the better end for us :), we hit the dance floor down in the underground car park.
The midnight surprise: a breathtaking fire-breather, who for some reason was interrupted by the security guard, we wonder why ;).
With this awesome party night marking the end of the <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.facebook.com/events/458143747717965/"><I>European Experience</I></A>, we used the following Sunday to enjoy a wonderful French breakfast and explore the tourist sites of the &quot;City of Love&quot; before it was time to board the plane back to the lab.

Just after arriving at the camp site and setting everything up, the first official point of the program was already about to begin: bar tour, yeah! A long and noisy night followed ;)
The next morning, the teams from literally all over Germany and extended Germany, also known as Denmark, assembled at the main event building and grabbed some awesome breakfast, including appropriate amounts of coffee, before being welcomed by our great hosts from <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.facebook.com/igemmarburg">iGEM Marburg</A>.
After introduction speeches by the sponsors of the event, the teams took the stage and presented their projects. As some time had passed since the Paris event, we got to see how the ideas had developed, and there were also some we had not seen before. Really awesome!
After grabbing lunch, it was our turn to show what we had done and would still do in the lab.

The afternoon was dedicated to physical activity of a special kind, <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_bump_football"><B>Bubble Soccer</B></A>. Probably the most hilarious game ever, though it will drain all your energy. Luckily our hosts had anticipated this and provided us with a tasty BBQ.
Though everyone was a bit tired, the day was far from over as there was the final party of the weekend.
The next morning came way too quickly, but luckily it was a beautiful sunny morning. We had the chance to hike to the castle and enjoy the amazing view from the top before it was again time to say Goodbye for a while and hit the road back to the lab.
Thanks again Marburg for having us, it was a pleasure!
