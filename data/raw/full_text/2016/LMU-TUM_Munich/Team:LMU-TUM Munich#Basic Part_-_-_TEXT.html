Basic Parts we improved
Tet-Operator: BBa_I739001 was improved by confirming functionality, adding a Tet-Operator together with an OmpA secretion signal yielding the part BBa_K2170141 which can be used by teams for the SEC-dependent secretion in the bacterial periplasm.
The collection of eukaryotic signal peptides in RFC[25] was expanded significantly by identifying non-working signal peptides ( BBa_I712009 , as not in RFC[25]), characterizing working signal peptides ( BBa_K157001 ) and designing, constructing and testing two additional signal peptides with significantly higher functionality ( BBa_K2170214 & BBa_K2170215 )
