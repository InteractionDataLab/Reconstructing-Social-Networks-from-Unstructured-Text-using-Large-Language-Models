Attributions
Our Sponsors
Without the generous support of our universities, related organizations and many biotech companies our project would not at all have been feasible.  We are deeply grateful for the big interest in supporting young students in realizing their own projects.
Academic Sponsors
Technical University Munich
[1]
TUM is one of Europe’s top universities. It is committed to excellence in research and teaching, interdisciplinary education and the active promotion of promising young scientists. The university also forges strong links with companies and scientific institutions across the world. TUM was one of the first universities in Germany to be named a University of Excellence. Moreover, TUM regularly ranks among the best European universities in international rankings.
Ludwig Maximilians University Munich
[2]
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München - the University in the heart of Munich. LMU is recognized as one of Europe's premier academic and research institutions. Since its founding in 1472, LMU has attracted inspired scholars and talented students from all over the world, keeping the University at the nexus of ideas that challenge and change our complex world.
Chair for Biological Chemistry - Prof. Dr. Skerra
[3]
We would like to thank our Principal Investigator Professor Dr. Arne Skerra , who generously granted our team not only laboratory space and competitive infrastructure at the Chair of Biological Chemistry but also his scientific supervision and expertise which was of great benefit for us. His internationally acknowledged contributions and comprehensive experience in molecular biotechnology and protein design were repeatedly awarded and his emphasis on practical application and economic use of academic research findings have led to the foundation of two very sucessful biotech companies.
GRK2062 - Molecular Principles of Synthetic Biology
The Research "Molecular Principles of Synthetic Biology" (GRK2062) is training doctoral researchers in a new way of thinking and in their research approaches. The research projects range from synthetic cells, synthetic switches to synthetic proteins and cell-free synthetic systems. The GRK2062 fosters close interdisciplinary collaborations between junior researchers from biology, chemistry and physics.
[4]
We have to thank the members of Steering Committee including our secondary PI Prof. Dr. Jung as well as Dr. Sabine Schneider and Prof. Dr. Schwille for the initiation and their extensive support of our joint university team this year.
DAAD - Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst
[5]
The DAAD, Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (German Academic Exchange Service) supports over 100,000 German and international students und researchers around the globe each year – making it the world’s largest funding organisation of its kind. We also promote internationalisation efforts at German universities, help developing countries build their own systems of higher education, and support German Studies and German language programmes abroad.
Wissenschaftszentrum Weihenstephan
[6]
The TUM School of Life Sciences Weihenstephan offers a unique location for science and learning. Its interdisciplinary synergies amongst all fields of the life science represented on the Weihenstephan Campus enable the exploration of the entire life cycle of foodstuffs and raw materials. Researchers at Weihenstephan examine the value chain from genetic and biological building blocks through production and processing to consumption. The close networking of research areas is what distinguishes the TUM School of Life Sciences Weihenstephan.
Lehre at LMU
[7]
The LMU-wide program Lehre@LMU for excellence in teaching aims to promote the development of the quality in teaching and studies. This concepts includes fostering new teaching ideas, expanding mentoring programs and especially supporting young academics.
Bund der Freunde - TUM
[8]
The “Bund der Freunde der TUM” (Friends of TUM) supports the Technical University of Munich in science, research and teaching – especially concerning the promotion of young academics. Even small amounts of money can make a difference in research projects, in student activities or help to take part in conferences at home and abroad. As a non-profit organization, this is where the “Bund der Freunde der TUM” (Friends of TUM) comes into play.
LMU Faculty for Biology
[9]
The Faculty of Biology of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich is situated on the High-Tec Campus Martinsried with a diversity of different research institutes, the university hospital and Biotech companies and at the Botanical Garden in Munich-Nymphenburg. It offers a modern and competitive working environment covering a broad spectrum disciplines of life sciences.
TUM Department of Chemistry
[10]
The Department of Chemistry at the Technische Universität München has taken great efforts to meet the requirements of a rapidly changing scientific environment. It offers a broad diversity of subjects: The traditional areas of Inorganic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, and Physical Chemistry have been enriched by Chemical Technology, Radiochemistry, Food Chemistry, Theoretical Chemistry, and Hydrochemistry many years ago. The last years saw new expansions into the fields of Biochemistry and Construction Chemistry.
CIPSM
[11]
The Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPSM) has become the premier facility for protein research in Germany. Set up in 2006, the major goal of the Cluster is to build up a comprehensive picture of protein functions – as isolated molecules, multisubunit complexes and molecular machines that mediate cell processes. So far, work at CiPSM has focused on the molecular properties of specific proteins. In future, more emphasis will be placed on understanding their function in cellular networks and on the chemical manipulation of proteins for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.
BioM
[12]
Since 1997, BioM is the networking agency for the biotechnology sector in Munich and Bavaria funded by the Bavarian State Ministry of Economic Affairs (Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Wirtschaft und Medien, Energie und Technologie). They support biotechnology companies and especially start-ups by offering consulting, events and international representation of the location.
