outer cell membrane we wanted to test some of the existing ones and submit new ones as well.
To achieve the best possible secretion of our eucaryotic receptors we tested three different signal peptides for their secretion efficiency.

It's expression is regulated by a CMV promotor and its secretion guided by a BM40 signal peptide. For better characterization a mRuby3 was added to the intracellular part of the fusion protein. Also an A3C5-Tag (intracellular), an antibody binding site, as well as a Strep TagII, a binding sequence for streptavidin, was added to have different possibilities for later characterization of the transfected construct. The intr- and extracellular parts are connected by an EGFR TMD with stop transfer signal, which makes sure that the TMD stays inside the membrane. The Biobrick contains an internal ribosomal binding site in front of the BirA so that it, although it is part of the same mRNA, is translated seperately from the rest of the transcript. The fusion protein is directed to the cellmembrane where it presents the biotinylated BAP on the surface where it can be bound by free streptavidin to impart a polymerization reaction between the cells which makes the scaffold free printing even possible. At the C terminal end of the BAP a Nanoluciferase was introduced so that the correct location of the receptor could be tested by NanoGlo-Assay.
