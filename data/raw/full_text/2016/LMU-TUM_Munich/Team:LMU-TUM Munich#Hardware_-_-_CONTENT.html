This might sound like the year 2100, and you are right, at the moment, <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:LMU-TUM_Munich/Proof">3D printing cell tissue</A> is not an easy endeavor. At the moment cells have to be printed with the help of scaffolds that support the cells until they grow and attach to each other. This process takes several days, it is difficult to maintain a complex geometry, and removing the scaffolds without destroying the tissue is still a major problem. So we just went ahead and solved all problems. 
Our synthetic biology department developed a possibility to 3D print cells almost as you would with plastic. You practically just get them near each other and they connect all by themselves in no time. The exact explanation of that can be found in our wiki. 
</P><P>Since the cells come in a fluid called bioink, we had to find a way to precisely print liquids. That was not our only aspiration. We wanted an affordable, open source product that is easy to use for everyone. We immediately thought about using a commercial syringe pump, but that absolutely did not come to terms with affordability, because prices for equipment like this usually start from around a thousand dollars.  Not only that, also the communication between the printer and pump would be hard to achieve with a commercial product. 
Since we would need a CNC printing system anyway, we decided that it would be best if the printer just printed its own extension pack. Developing a whole new FDM printer and optimizing the printing process would have been a task for a much larger engineering team. That is why we decided to go for an Ultimaker 2 plus and modify it. It is one of the most precise printers in its price segment and also easily customizable. Additionally, many tech-savvy people own that model.
</P><P>This way, our syringe pump can be easily spread on open source platforms to get user feedback and maybe it even push research in the bioprinting segment to a new level.
Unfortunately, a 3D printer cannot be expected to work in tolerances as small as in steel constructions, so some parts (like threaded spindles) have to be bought. We found a similar project of an open source syringe pump, which we would like to give credit to here<SUP id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-1">[1]</A></SUP>, for we reverse engineered that design and constructed our own, improved version. 
After lots and lots of construction and prototyping, we proudly present to you a precisely functioning liquid printer that could not be easier to set up and use. 
Currently, our friends at TU Darmstadt are testing our device and so do a lot of users on open source platforms, and so can you.
How you get from printing plastic to printing cells will be explained step by step in the following manual and description.
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:802px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">This is how easily you can print your own printer extension.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Basic_principle">Basic principle</SPAN></H1><DIV class="white-box"><P>The basic function of our printer is easy to understand: 
A syringe filled with <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:LMU-TUM_Munich/Proof">bioink</A> is placed in the syringe pump, which then precisely moves the plunger. The thereby displaced cells are pushed through a capillary into a cannula that is mounted on the print head. By using the printer's electromechanics, the printing motion is achieved.
The Ultimaker already has an opportunity to install a second extruder motor, which is usually responsible for conveying the plastic filament to the hot end printing nozzle. By using that second output, the printer is able to communicate with our syringe pump by making <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:LMU-TUM_Munich/Software#Firmware">minor changes to the firmware</A>, which can be downloaded and easily installed. This is explained in the <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:LMU-TUM_Munich/Software">software tab</A>.
This way, you can use Cura, which is a <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:LMU-TUM_Munich/Software#Cura_Software">software to convert 3D models</A> into the printer's language (the so called G-code), to tell the printer to print any geometry made of bioink directly into an ibidi slide. This dish is held in place by a retainer that replaces the glass on the Ultimaker's build plate.

</P></DIV><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Syringe_pump">Syringe pump</SPAN></H2><DIV class="white-box"><P>The syringe pump is the main part of our printer extension. Its purpose is to deliver a precise and constant volume flow of liquid according to the printer's information.
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:802px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Exploded view of our syringe pump.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><OL><LI><B>baseplate:</B> The Baseplate is the main part of the syringe pump. This 3D printed part is designed to retain all the other components and withstand the mechanical loads. The syringe is to be mounted with the help of a bayonet system that lets you lock it with a simple 35° turn.</LI><LI><B>stepper motor:</B> The stepper motor supplies the torque needed to move the syringe. The difference to the DC motor, which is the best known kind of electrical motor, is that the configuration of the coils inside divides the motor's rotation into steps. Most motor controllers are capable of microstepping, i.e. the motor only moves a fraction of a step at a time. Commonly used is one sixtienth of a step. Since our stepper motor is divided into 200 steps, and we use one sixtienth microstepping, it allows us to move the motor as precisely as 0.1125° while providing a smooth running behavior, which is crucial for our print result.</LI><LI><B>connector:</B> The connector's job is the force transmission from the motor to the spindle. It is 3D printed.</LI><LI><B>trapezoidal threaded spindle:</B> With the help of the spindle, the rotation of the motor is converted to a translational movement. The standardized designation 'TR8x1.5' contains the diameter of the spindle (8mm) and its lead (1.5mm). A lead of 1.5 mm means that the spindle converts a rotation of 360° to 1.5 mm of translation. We used the smallest lead we could find, for it determines the accuracy of the pump even further. With the current setup, the syringe plunger would move 468 nm per microstep, which is the wavelength of blue light. At this point, the limitation for our precision becomes the manufacturing accuracy of the mechanical parts.</LI><LI><B>syringe carrier:</B> The syringe carrier is a 3D printed part, with an indentaion that holds the back of the syringe's plunger and makes it possible to move it bidirectionally. That makes it possible to empty or fill the syringe.</LI><LI><B>linear ball bearings:</B> The linear ball bearings are glued into holes in the syringe carrier. Thanks to the steel balls inside, they make sure that the syringe carrier does not cant and moves with the least friction possible.</LI><LI><B>trapezoidal nut:</B> This is the counterpart of the trapezoidal threaded spindle. Usually, for motor applications ball screws that work in the same manner as ball bearings are used. Because of the small speeds needed while operating the printer, we could use a simple trapezoidal nut that is cheaper and smaller.</LI><LI><B>end stops:</B> Because of the gear reduction the spindle provides, the small motor can cause enormous forces. To prevent the syringe pump from destroying itself when hitting its walls we build in end stops, which are switches that tell the software when the syringe carrier has reached its end position. The motor is then only permitted to move in the other direction. Usually, there are special end stops with a mechanical appliance that keeps them safe when hit by a moving component. Again, due to the low speeds we were able to use simple push buttons that saved us money and space.</LI><LI><B>rods:</B> Steel rods with good surface quality where the ball bearings can glide on and minimize friction.</LI><LI><B> cylinder head screws with hexagon socket:</B>These M3x5 cylinder head screws with hexagon socket (DIN ISO 7984) arrest the motor.</LI><LI><B>cover:</B> This 3D printed part is solely for aesthetic purposes and covers the motor compartment.</LI><LI><B> 3 ml syringe:</B>This is a BD 3ml syringe with Luer-Lok, although all similarily sized syringes should work. This serves as a container for the bioink.</LI><LI><B>hooks:</B> These 3D printed hooks can be used to hang the pump to the side of your printer.</LI></OL></DIV><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Print_head">Print head</SPAN></H2><DIV class="white-box"><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:802px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Exploded view of our print head.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>

It uses Cura's &quot;high quality&quot; setting with all standard settings, except for the heating bed temperature that was set up to 100°C. We printed with a 0.4 mm nozzle on Kapton foil, which makes the material stick, but also easy to remove when cold. Additionally, we dabbed the foil in acetone dissolved ABS, to make it stick even better. All parts were printed with standard 20% infill, except for the connector, that was printed with 100% infill.

This instructable will give you a step by step guide to equip the Ultimaker2+ with a connection for a syringe pump. First you have to remove the cable channel behind the printing platform. This will allow you to unscrew the cover from the bottom and gives you access to the main board.  
Measure the location of the hole for you 8-PIN DIN connector. If possible, mark exactly where the hole needs to be drilled. Choose the drill size appropriate to your connector. 
Plug in the two connectors to the EXP_4 and J31 pins on the main board and fix you DIN-connector on the Ultimaker casting. Reassemble the mainboard cover and the cable channel. Now you have successfully upgraded your Ultimaker with a syringe pump connector.

Industrial CNC mills are capable of the IT6 standard<SUP id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-2">[2]</A></SUP>, which is in micrometer dimensions. Sadly, 3D printers tend to be inaccurate, not due to their mechanics, but because of the fact that liquid plastic is printed, which still changes its form after stacked on the previous layer until it hardens. This forced us to experiment with different settings and sizes to produce fitting parts like the puzzle of the dish retrainer or the rod's holes in the baseplate.
Also, FDM printers are not capable of printing big overhangs for the material just falls down when not having any support. It is possible to print with automatically generated support structures, but the affected areas have to be post-processed, which is not always easy at inaccessible spaces. That is why we need quite some creativity and take unorthodox approaches to some elements.
Since we decided to use ABS plastic because it is much stronger than the more commonly used PLA, it also brought more frequent printing flaws with it, that result from thermal expansion. For instance warping, that bends the whole part, or rips between the layers. These issues had to be tackled by optimizing the print settings and constructing reinforcements or even thinning the material at some places, resulting in a lot of prototyping, like 12 different versions of the baseplate were printed.

The basic mechanics were good, but could still use some work.

Even though the forces occuring in our system are relatively small, we could save some material by structural optimization.</LI><LI>We wanted the syringe pump to look more appealing, that's why we made significant changes to the design.</LI><LI>The teflon coated lead screw in this project is unnecessarily complicated and hard to find. Similar results could be achieved with a simple trapezoidal threaded spindle and lubricant.</LI><LI>The new baseplate's form enabled us to make a cable channel shaped like a spline. We interpolated it in a way, so that it has the least slope possible. The cable can now simply be pushed through the channel without having to use a large opening.</LI><LI>Hall sensors as end stops are difficult to calibrate and were replaced by push buttons.</LI><LI>Instead of the copper bearing that easily wear out, we obtained linear ball bearings.</LI><LI>The syringe is now mounted with a bayonet that makes it a lot easier to operate</LI></UL></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="User_Feedback_from_our_Collaboration_with_the_iGEM_Team_TU_Darmstadt">User Feedback from our Collaboration with the iGEM Team TU Darmstadt</SPAN></H1><DIV class="white-box"><P>We convinced the iGEM team from TU Darmstadt (also in Germany) to test our syringe pump as beta-testers, so that we can get direct feedback from the iGEM community concerning our most complex part. As all the other parts are far more simple we assume that iGEM students that manage the printing and assembly of our syringe pump will also be able to assemble the whole biotINK bioprinter.
Here is their feedback after they assembled our syringe pump:
</P><P><I>The pump is neat and stable. The idea of using buttons as end stops is in principle good. You took the necessary holes into account and we were able to assemble it according to the instructions.</I><I>The click system for the syringe was well made and worked straightaway. The linear bearing could be used right away as well.</I></P><I>We utilized a homemade 3D printer on highest gear for printing the parts. As you might know this leads to relatively many &quot;aberrations&quot; and errors in the prints. They made the assembly difficult and we had to post process several of them. </I><P><I>Your construction is designed quite closed, which renders it difficult for any passionate tinkerer to make adaptations after the printing. For instance we noted that you had sent us a printed clutch though the stepper motor was not shortened and did not fit. Therefor we drilled a hole in the front, enlarged the clutch and clued the parts together.</I><I>In general there are different stepper motors in use in the DIY community, hence we suggest to concept a more general clutch to ease this problem.</I><I>Furthermore the suspension device for the syringe could be improved, though the varying design of DIY printers makes finding a &quot;good&quot; solution rather difficult.</I></P></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="References">References</SPAN></H1><DIV class="white-box"><OL class="references"><LI id="cite_note-1"><SPAN class="mw-cite-backlink"><A href="#cite_ref-1">↑</A></SPAN><SPAN class="reference-text"><A rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Syringe-Pump-Rack/">http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Syringe-Pump-Rack/</A></SPAN></LI><LI id="cite_note-2"><SPAN class="mw-cite-backlink"><A href="#cite_ref-2">↑</A></SPAN><SPAN class="reference-text"><A rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.engineersedge.com/international_tol.htm">http://www.engineersedge.com/international_tol.htm</A></SPAN></LI></OL></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><FOOTER class="col-sm-9 col-sm-offset-3 noprint page-footer clearfix white-box"><A class="btt visible-xs-block" href="#top"><SPAN class="sr-only">Back to top</SPAN></A><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-4 social"><H2>Follow us on:</H2></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-4 universities"><H2>LMU &amp; TUM Munich</H2><P>United team from Munich's universities</P></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-4 address"><H2>Contact us:</H2><H3>Address</H3><P>iGEM Team TU-Munich
