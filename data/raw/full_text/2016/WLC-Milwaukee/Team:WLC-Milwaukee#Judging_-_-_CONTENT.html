We have used a Western blot to demonstrate that the TolC protein is being expressed from these genes. Based on antibiotic sensitivity experiments, we have demonstrated that these TolC proteins are also functional in the E. coli cell. We documented the characterization of each part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device.</P><P>	Convince the judges that you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way.

Since we attend a school with a Christian background, we have an obligation to ensure that the ethics of our project are based in our Christian beliefs. By informing various WELS organizations on the details of our project, we are showing many people that there is good in what we are trying to accomplish. There can be a bad stigma when it comes to science and religion, and we are trying to break this barrier down so we can happily coincide with each other. We want to show high school students who want to pursue a degree in research that it does not have to go against their religious beliefs. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="gold rounded"><H2 class="center"> Gold </H2><P> In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, our team also achieved these following goals:</P><P>	Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.</P><P>-	<A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:WLC-Milwaukee/HP/Gold#summer_camp">Bioengineering Summer Camp</A></P><P>-	<A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:WLC-Milwaukee/HP/Gold#biotech_info_night">Biotech Info Night</A></P><P>To integrate our project into our human practices, we used the previous events to educate many students on the topic of coral disappearance due to infection by Serratia marcescens. By informing the students on this subject, we can spread the importance of our research and lab work. It was of importance that we explain to our listeners that our project is attempting to make a difference. During the summer camp, the students were give a tour of various coral reef tanks as well as hearing a lecture on the importance and disappearance of the coral reefs. At Biotech Info Night, Elise, Harrison, and Jack discussed the effect of S. marcescens on Elkhorn coral that we have been researching in our project.</P><P>	Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:WLC-Milwaukee">your own team in a previous year of iGEM</A>). </P><P>Our 2014 iGEM team generated a BioBrick K1406000 that contained an arabinose-inducible promoter and ribosomal binding site (RBS). While the sequence was correct, we were unable to demonstrate that the promoter and RBS were functional. This year’s team has taken that part and added TolC genes from three new bacterial species, such as Serratia marcescens tolC, Klebsiella tolC, and E. coli tolC, and the arabinose promoter did express these tolC genes.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="footer clear"><DIV id="right"><DIV id="contacts"><DIV id="address"><P>Address:</P><P>Wisconsin Lutheran College</P><P>8800 West Bluemound Road</P><P>Milwaukee, WI 53226</P><P>igem@wlc.edu</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
