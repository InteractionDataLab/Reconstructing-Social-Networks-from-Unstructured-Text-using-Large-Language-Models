STEM

In November 2015, we helped a fellow colleague organize and run an educational session for high school girls for the Young Women’s STEM Program. This program exposed high school girls to college level cell biology lab activities, current cell biology research, and study strategies. They were introduced to an area of science that has only been touched on briefly in their high school classes. Additionally, they were able to see what someone in the science field does and have female role models demonstrate just that. Each month, girls from high schools in the Milwaukee area had the opportunity to learn about a different scientific subject ranging from Chemistry and Biology to Mathematics and Computer Science. The idea was to push them farther than their high school classes are able and to present them with women who are in that field doing the work. For three hours once a month, these girls did hands-on activities, learned about current research, and met women working in a specific field of science with the field changing at each session. The final activity gave the girls tips and study strategies in order to succeed in the classes that would be necessary for them to pursue these careers for themselves.
