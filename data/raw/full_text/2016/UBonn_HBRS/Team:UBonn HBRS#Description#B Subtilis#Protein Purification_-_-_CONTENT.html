proteins in <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> and purify them. The
enzymes used in this project are equipped with a C-
terminal polyhistidine-tag (his-tag). A his-tag is a
sequence of at least 6 histidine residues, giving the
protein of interest an affinity for nickel. Through the
complexed nickel ions in Ni-NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid)
columns, the proteins containing his-tags can be isolated
from other proteins. Specific detection methods via small
molecules or antibodies for his-tags also exist, allowing
for the simple validation of enzyme expression.
</P><P>The first step in the protein purification procedure, is to
cultivate the bacteria containing the plasmid with the
protein to be expressed. Protein expression is then
induced through the addition of IPTG (Isopropyl-β-D-
thiogalactopyranosid). After further growth for 3-4 hours,
the cells are harvested and lysed. The lysed cells are
then transferred to Ni-NTA columns, where the his-
tagged proteins bind to nickel bearing agarose beads,
separating them from the rest of the cellular material.
Next the columns are washed to remove all irrelevant
material. Lastly the his-tagged proteins are eluted from
the beads through the addition of Imidazole (C3N2H4)o.
Imidazole, a ring structure also found in the histidine
structure, competes with this molecule for binding to the
nickel beads thus displacing the his-tagged proteins and
eluting them.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Complete_Protocol">Complete Protocol</SPAN></H3><P>An overnight culture of 10 mL of medium with antibiotic
(1mM, for T7-RNA-Polymerase, Amp) is grown at 37°C
and 180 rpm. Inoculate Bacteria in 100ml LB and
antibiotic (1mMol). The OD600 is measured every 20 min until an OD600 of 0.5 is reached. Protein expression is
then induced through the addition of IPTG (1mMol) and
the samples are incubated for another 3-4 h. To control
your results it is wise to collect a sample before and after
IPTG induction to compare the content of your protein of
interest. The bacteria are pelleted at 3000g at 4°C for 30
min. The pellets can either be stored at -20°C or you
can immediately proceed with lysing.
The bacteria pellets are lysed through the resuspension
in 25 mL of lysis buffer prepared according to table 1
and followed by sonification with the settings listed in
table 3.

The samples are then centrifuged at 3000g at 4°C for
one hour. In this time the agarose beads are prepared.
For each sample you need 1.2 mL Ni-NTA agarose
beads. They are centrifuged for 2 min at 1000rpm and
the supernatant is discarded. The beads are washed
twice with 1.5 mL lysis buffer. After each washing step
the beads are centrifuged again for 2 min at 1000 rpm
and the supernatant is discarded. After washing the
beads are resuspended in 1 mL lysis buffer and stored
on ice. The cleared lysates are distributed into 15 mL
falcons and the Ni-NTA beads are added. The samples
are then incubated at 4°C for 30min to an hour using an
overhead tumbler. The samples are then applied to
large Biorad columns and the flowthrough is
collected. The beads are washed 4x with 5 mL of lysis
buffer each. The wash fractions are collected for later
analysis. Finally, the proteins are eluted through the
addition of 2 x 1.5 mL of elution buffer prepared as
described in table 3. The eluate is collected and kept on
ice. To further purify the protein, the eluate is transferred
to dialysis tubing and dialyzed overnight at 4°C in
dialysis buffer (refer to table 4).

All fractions of protein purification, i.e. flowthrough, wash
fraction and eluate are analysed via an SDS page gel.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Visualization">Visualization</SPAN></H3><P>After purification, a SDS page gel is used to analyze the
amount of his-tagged proteins in each fraction of the
purification procedure, as well as to confirm the
expression of the protein. First the bands of the gel are
analyzed on a coomassie gel, to confirm the presence of
proteins (compare Fig. 3). The his-tagged protein is then
specifically visualized via InVisionTM His-Tag In- gel
staining. Invision staining results in fluorescent bands
that can be detected using UV light (compare Fig. 4). We
performed this protocol according to manufacturer's
instructions (refer to InVisionTM His-tag In-gel Stain
manual, Macherey and Nagel).
</P><P>Due to the weight variation (22,6 kDA – 107 kDA) of our
Enzymes, we used a 12% SDS Page-Gel. The gels were
prepared according to table 5. The gels were run at
150V 500mA 30W for 1h.

The Invision Stain was imaged with a Gel doc. The samples were loaded onto the gel in following order,
BSA, BSA and T7. The BSA serves as a negative control, as it lacks a his- tag and should not show
flourescence. The T7-RNA-Polymerase however contains a his-tag and is thusly visible as a band in the third column. <STRONG>Right:</STRONG> Coomassiestain of ladder, BSA and T7-RNA-polymerase. 
The figure shows a test of our SDS-Protocol and Coomassie staining. The gel shows the bands of our
negative control non his-tag protein BSA (Bovine serum albumin) with a weight of 66.5 k in comparison to our
positive his-tag protein T7-RNA-Polymerase with a weight of 99kDA.

Due to the lack of time, it was not possible to analyze the
expression of our proteins.
