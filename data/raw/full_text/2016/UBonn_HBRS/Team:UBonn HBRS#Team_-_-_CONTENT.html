His thirst for knowledge, interest in all things scientific and his willingness to try even daring things out are essential qualities that he brings to our team.

Gintare is forever amused by the fact that virtually every German person she has met is stumped by the name of her native country in English: Lithuania (luckily they always let out an understanding &quot;achso&quot; when she follows up with &quot;Litauen.&quot;)

Quick-thinking and quick on her feet,  Triinu is a great member to have around when the need to spot problems arises. That humorous stereotype of Estonians being slow can't be more wrong in this case!
