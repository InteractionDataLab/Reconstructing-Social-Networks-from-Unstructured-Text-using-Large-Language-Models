certain conditions, making activity comparable between different samples and experiments. The activity
is either described by the amount of product formed over a given time or the amount of substrate having been consumed.
</P><P>Different parameters affecting the activity of enzymes are substrates and their concentration, pH,
ionic strength, buffer type and temperature.
</P><P>In our project, we employed stopped colorimetric assays. This means that the assays were
stopped after a fixed time by heat-inactivating the enzymes and the amount of product formed was
measured. Colorimetric assays makes it possible to easily quantify the reaction product by spectrophotometry,
often by converting it again with another reagent. The absorbance at a given wavelength is directly
proportional to the amount of product in the sample. In this experiment, 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid was used.
</P><P>The enzymes tested were cellulases, specfically endoglucanases (endo-1,4-β-D-glucanase, <I>Acidothermus cellulolyticus</I>,
Sigma-Aldrich) and xylanases (endo-1,4-β-Xylanase M4, <I>Aspergillus niger</I>, Megazyme). The fromer
breaks down cellulose molecules by hydrolysis of the 1,4-beta-D-
glycosidic linkages into monosaccahrides such as beta-glucose. Xylanase breaks down
hemicellulose by degrading polysaccahride beta-1,4-xylan (Beechwood) into xylose.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Experimental_Setup_and_Validation">Experimental Setup and Validation</SPAN></H2><P>The tests done always follow a similar recipe (see protocol) that contains sugar or enzyme solution,
citrate buffer, water, substrate and DNS.
Buffers are needed to adjust and stabilize the pH for enzyme assays. The concentration that works
for our chosen enzymes is 50mM.
The Substrate used for endoglucanase was Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) which is a cellulose
derivative that the enzyme is able to cleave. Initially for the standard calibrations 1:3 CMC was
used but in order to increase the availability of the substrate, the assays with enzymes had CMC 3:7.
Substrate for xylanase was 1% xylan, also known as beechwood.
DNS is aromatic compound that reacts with reducing sugars to form 3-amino-5-nitrosalicylic acid-
</P><DIV class="img-100 with-caption" style=""><DIV class="caption"><I>DNS digest assay</I></DIV></DIV><P>This absorbs light at 540 nm creating a possibility to quantify the product present in the sample.
Additionally, absorbance at 750 nm was measured in order to subtract the background absorbance
for normalization. 
Additional water served purpose for having room to change different part of the recipe while still
keeping constant volume. 
Analysis of the data was done with Open Office Calc.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Standard_Calibration">Standard Calibration</SPAN></H3><P>In order to determine the concentration of the substance of interest, standard calibration of the
sample with known concentrations is necessary. Xylose was used for xylanase and glucose for
endoglucanase.
</P><P>Initially, a wide range of sugar concentration was tested which was 100 mg/ml to 0,001 mg/ml.
Through several experiments, a linear working range was determined to be 10 mg/ml to 0,5 mg/ml
(0,1to 0,005 μg in total in the sample) 
Experiments creating a linear standard calibration lead to following results.
</P><DIV class="img-100 with-caption" style=""><DIV class="caption"><STRONG>Figure 1. Glucose standard calibration.</STRONG> The graph shows the absorbance results against the glucose concentrations of 0 to 0,1 μg in total.
		</DIV></DIV><DIV class="img-100 with-caption" style=""><DIV class="caption"><STRONG>Figure 2. Xylose standard calibration.</STRONG> The graph illustrates the relationship between absorbance and xylose concentrations at 0 to 0,2 0,1 μg in total.
		</DIV></DIV><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Discussion">Discussion</SPAN></H4><P>The final results show linear range as expected and needed in order to validate the
complete assay. Deviations increase with increasing concentration as smaller
mistakes have then more effect. However, both xylose and glucose yielded usable
results that aided in determination of the unit range, that should be used in
experiments with enzymes.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Citrate_and_Glycerol_Tests">Citrate and Glycerol Tests</SPAN></H3><P>In order to validate that the read out is not falsified by the variables in the test tube, a series of
experiments were done. This entailed doing experiments with citrate buffer and glycerol. Buffer is
needed to to create pH optimum and glycerol is enzyme stabilizing agent. Different concentrations
of citrate buffer, glycerol and sugars were used.
</P><P>A range of sugar concentrations of 0,1 μg to 0,0005 μg of total amount of sugar in sample was
chosen for both experiments with exception of glucose citrate assay. The reason for higher high end
glucose concentration, is due the fact that, results above 0,1 μg went over the measurable
absorbance for other experiments and data point could not have been included. For citrate buffer,
the concentrations were 1M to 0 M. In case of glycerol, the range was 90-0 %. The experimental set
up followed same principle as before. The results can be viewed below.
</P><DIV class="img-100 with-caption" style=""><DIV class="caption"><STRONG>Figure 3. Citrate Assay with Glucose.</STRONG> Citrate concentrations go from 1 M down to 0 M and were tested with glucose concentrations 1 to 0,0005 μg.

		</DIV></DIV><P>
The obtained results show that the absorbance measured at was nearly constant for both, citrate
buffer assays with very low fluctuation.
</P><DIV class="img-100 with-caption" style=""><DIV class="caption"><STRONG>Figure 5. Glycerol Assay with Glucose.</STRONG> The tested glycerol concentration ranged from 90% to 0 and the sugar from 0,1 μg to 0,005.
		</DIV></DIV><DIV class="img-100 with-caption" style=""><DIV class="caption"><STRONG>Figure 6. Glycerol Assay with Xylose.</STRONG> The glycerol concentration varied from 90% to 0 and the sugar from 0,1 μg to 0,005 μg.
		</DIV></DIV><P>
The results are similar to the ones from citrate. Here once again the absorbance values stay near
constant through all measurements.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Discussion_2">Discussion</SPAN></H4><P>Citrate and glycerol result showed both similar pattern. There was some fluctuation between the
samples, however, this can be taken as an error. Glycerol is rather viscous and therefore, difficult to
pipette. Furthermore, sources of mistakes must be considered such as errors from pipetting. All in
all, it can be concluded that citrate and glycerol have no effect in the experiments done.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Enzyme_Assays">Enzyme Assays</SPAN></H2><P>The assays done with xylanase and endoglucanase followed similar principle to the previous
experiments. Precautions were taken to keep samples on cooler rack while preparing enzyme
samples, in order to preserve the enzyme activity.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Endoglucanase_Assays">Endoglucanase Assays</SPAN></H3><P>Endoglucanase assays are made difficult by the substrate viscosity. This is the main source of
deviations in these assays. Standard calibration was done in parallel to the enzyme experiments.
</P><P>The results of the endoglucanase assays are illustrated on the upcoming graphs.
</P><DIV class="img-100 with-caption" style=""><DIV class="caption"><STRONG>Figure 7. Standard calibration of the Glucose for Endoglucanase.</STRONG> Absorbance is put against the glucose concentrations in μmol.
		</DIV></DIV><DIV class="img-100 with-caption" style=""><DIV class="caption"><STRONG>Figure 8. Endoglucanase Assay.</STRONG> Absorbance of the samples shown in relationship to corresponding enzyme Units.
		</DIV></DIV><P>
The graphs show linear ranges but error bars can be considered big. This is especially true for the
enzyme experiment. Units used went up to 0,25 U and absorbance maxima was 0,225. Going over
the amount of enzymes produced saturated curve. Lower values also showed results that can not be
take into account, as they showed random results opposed to constant increase with increasing
concentrations.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Xylanase_Assay">Xylanase Assay</SPAN></H3><P>Xylanase assays were successful and the results can be seen on the graphs below. Standards were
done in parallel to the enzyme assay.
</P><DIV class="img-100 with-caption" style=""><DIV class="caption"><STRONG>Figure 9. Standard calibration of the Xylose for Xylanase Assay.</STRONG> Absorbance results are plotted against sugar concentration in μmol.
		</DIV></DIV><DIV class="img-100 with-caption" style=""><DIV class="caption"><STRONG>Figure 10. Xylanase Assay.</STRONG> Absorbance in reference to the enzyme units used in the sample.
		</DIV></DIV><P>
Both graphs show a linear trend. Highest amount of units used was 0,1U, which resulted in an absorbance around 0,75.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Discussion_3">Discussion</SPAN></H4><P>The experiments done with the enzymes gave analysable results. The proper linear
trend line of standard calibration shows that the the samples were treated properly
and acted as in experiments done before.
</P><P>Endoglucanase assays show large deviations but give a linear trend line. Deviations
source is mainly the properties of solutions used in the experiment and reasons that
will be discussed in next sub-chapter.
</P><P>The enzyme assay gives lower absorbance results which is likely due to the properties
of the enzyme and substrate. Endoglucanase has lower activity to begin with in
comparison to Xylanase. It could also be that the amount of substrate present was not
enough to show full activity. However, tests were done in different CMC
concentrations to find the point where the trend line becomes saturated.
</P><P>In case of xylanase, the results show a expected linear patter and deviations are low.
This can be contrasted to viscosity of substrate for endoglucanase. Xylan is much
more easy to pipet, not leading to as many differences that could come from residual
liquids. It also shows higher activity based on information provided my manufacturer.
</P><P>All in all, the experiments were successful but improvable.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Troubleshooting_and_Missing_Parts">Troubleshooting and Missing Parts</SPAN></H4><P>Probable sources of errors are pipetting, time differences in
preparations of the samples, room temperature, decay of enzymatic activity and
viscosity of solutions. Measures must be taken where possible, in order to decrease
the amount of deviations.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Protocols">Protocols</SPAN></H4><P>All experiments followed same principle and similar recipe.
</P><P>The recipe for the experiments can be seen in the following table.
