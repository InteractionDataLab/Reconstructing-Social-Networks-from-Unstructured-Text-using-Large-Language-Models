Science Slam
Science Slam - the event for everyone.
The aim of the slam is to introduce non-scientific public to different academic topics presented by researches in a short period of time in an easy understandable way. At the end of the slam the winner is chosen by the public.
This year our team organized 2 different science slams that attracted more than 500 people each.
During the slams people also get to know more about synthetic Biology and about iGEM itself.
