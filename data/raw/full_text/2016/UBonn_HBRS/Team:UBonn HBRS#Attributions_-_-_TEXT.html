General support
We thank the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-University of Bonn , the Limes Institute Bonn and the University of Applied Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg for providing the laboratory space, material and funding.
Scientific supervision
We are very grateful to Prof. Dr. Günther Mayer and Prof. Dr. Michael Famulok of University Bonn for supervising this project. We would also like to thank Prof. Dr. Klaus Lehmann of HBRS for his resourceful and unlimited support.
Lab support
Our dearest thanks go to our instructor Ignacio Geraci and all the other PhDs, PhD students and technicians of Professor Mayer’s and Prof. Famulok’s laboratory, especially Thinhinane Chaou, Laia Civit, Laura Eiden, Jeffrey Hannam, Mark Kerzhner, Daniel Matzner, Franziska Pfeiffer,  Anna Pyka, Christian Renzl, Malte Rosenthal, Anna Schüller, Julia Siegl, Justina Stark, Jörg Ewers, Sebastian Pilsl, Silvana Haßel and Olga Wolter for their help and patience. We would also like to give special thanks to Stefan Künne for all his support and supervision throughout the project.
B. subtilis support
For their support with electroporation and the use of their equipment we would like to thank all members of the AG Dickschadt from the chemical institute of the University of Bonn. Furthermore, we would like to thank Prof. Satoshi Matsuoka for the gracious donation of B. subtilis expression plasmids containing three enzymes of interest and Prof. Thomas Schweder from the Institute of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology at the University of Greifswald for the use of two Bacillus subtilis strains LS8P-D and ATCC 6051.
Equipment Support
For the use of titration equipment we would like to thank Dr. Ralf Weisbarth from the Chemical Institute at the University of Bonn and for the use of a lipase kit we would like to thank Prof. Christoph Thiele from the LIMES institute at the University of Bonn.
Project advisor support
Benedikt HÖLBLING
took care of the team’s finances, initiated and organized the team's science slams.
BÙI Hoàng Duy
gave pieces of advice to the project.

Team Attributions
Our Team Members worked in the following groups, learn more about our team on our
Team Page
B. subtilis
Ariana Natalie KLAPPERT
optimzied PAGE gel analysis and protein expression.
Jonas GOCKEL
prepared competent bacteria, tested transformation protocols and established the Bacillus Subtilis collaboration with Freiburg.

BÙI Hoàng Duy
provided help in all tasks of cloning.
Jonas GOCKEL
took part in backbone cloning.
Laura LÓPEZ NAVARRETE
collaborated in assembling DNA constructs of tags and genes in E. coli and prepared rapid ligase buffer.
Michael TESKE
supported the team with restriction analysis, ligations, minipreps and prepared rapid ligase buffer.
Niklas Arndt SCHMACKE
Designed the part sequences of nprb and sacB as well as the genes to be tested in deinking together with Max Schelski.
Sophia MÄDLER
assembled our working backbone, took care of introducing the working methods to new members, designed the pLac-RBS construct, performed analysis of sequencing results and planned experiments to assemble all constructs.
