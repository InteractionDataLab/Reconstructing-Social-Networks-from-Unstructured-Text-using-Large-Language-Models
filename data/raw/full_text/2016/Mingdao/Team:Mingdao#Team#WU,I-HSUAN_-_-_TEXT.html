PPT
My name is Amanda, now a senior one grader. My job in the iGEM team is the vice leader. With my carefulness, costiveness, and ambition, I can surely lead our team to success. The reason why I participate in iGEM is because that I want to attend a college department regarding biochemistry. By attending iGEM, undoubtedly, I can learn a lot of useful things. I am a perfectionist. Even though I don’t really have much talent, I push myself to the limit to achieve the best I can. As the saying goes, “Practice makes perfect.”
