We've attended an iGEM team interact conference held by National Chiao Tung University (UCTU) on June 30th. With the participation of National Tsing Hua University(NTHU) and Chang Gung University(CGU) , this interaction seemed so interesting and we had an absolutely marvelous time spending together talking over our topics. Mingdao iGEM team actually benefited so much from those great iGEM teams, it's worth noting that the lively discussion we had made inspired us of a brand new thoughts. We really appreciated that UCTU gave us this opportunity to communicate with those brilliant iGEM teams.
In retrospect, there are so many wonderful memories for us in this conference. The starting ceremony, team meetups, workshop collaborations, to name a few. Aside from simply presenting our respective projects, a strong sense of " iGem is like a big family" greatly hit home. As "arguably" the youngest participants in the conference, we receive help and support from other teams a lot. We couldn't be more grateful for that, and we deeply believe that collaboration is one of the most precious treasures that an iGem team could ever possess.
