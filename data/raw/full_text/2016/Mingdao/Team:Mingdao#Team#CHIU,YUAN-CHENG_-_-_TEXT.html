Art & Wiki
Hey, this is Ryan Chiu from Mingdao High School. I have a lot of hobbies like playing basketball, reading novels, listening to music, and, sometimes, draw pictures. These are the things I enjoy doing in my spare time.  The reason why I joined iGEM is that I like to do scientific experiments especially those about biology, and it was not until I joined iGEM did I realize how beautiful and profound this world is, which made me deeply in love. What I do in this team is to work on the posters and other art works. Our logo was made by me, as well. Oh! And I also act as the mascot of our team at the Jamboree, so...can't wait to see you guys in Boston~
