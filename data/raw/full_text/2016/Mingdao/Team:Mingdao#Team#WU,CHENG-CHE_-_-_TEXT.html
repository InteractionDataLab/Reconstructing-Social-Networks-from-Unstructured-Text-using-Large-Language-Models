Hi everyone! My name is Zack and I’m from Republic of Taiwan. I’ve joined the iGEM team for about 9 months. Basically, I film some videos for my team and design our web page. In my free time, playing guitar is my favorite activity and I teach guitar in pop music club. Believe it or not, I can play guitar the whole day if I had time. Thanks iGEM for giving me such a good chance to show my talent, we’ll meet each other in Boston soon, hope we can have a good time there !
