Mingdao iGEM 2016
There was a group of high school students in Taiwan, full of curiosity and passion and wanted to do something big. They learn a lot of knowledge from school, on books, from teachers, but instead of learning for tests they wanted to put what they learn into practice. That’s us iGEM Team Mingdao 2016 a year ago, we wanted to do something different and unique in our teenage years, and iGEM is our opportunity to do it. After a year of hard working, we learn skills of doing experiments and how to finish a project. Now, we’re well prepared and can’t wait to show the world our results.
