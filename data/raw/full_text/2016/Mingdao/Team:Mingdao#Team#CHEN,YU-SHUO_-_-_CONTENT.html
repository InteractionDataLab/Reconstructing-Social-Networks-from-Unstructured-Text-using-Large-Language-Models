Hi guys! My name is Eric, I'm from Taiwan and I'm turning seventeen this year. I love everything about art, design, drawing or whatever you name it, and that's also the reason I'm here, to draw and do design for the project. It is my job to make the poster and the website look good. Beside drawing, I also enjoy making videos, playing games, doing sports and making music. It's my pleasure to be a member of this team, working on a project and fighting for the same goal. I had learned a lot in iGEM. Now please keep learning cool stuff from our website and enjoy!
