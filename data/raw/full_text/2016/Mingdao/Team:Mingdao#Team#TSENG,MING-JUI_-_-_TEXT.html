TSENG,MING-JUI
Human practice
Hello, my name is Tseng Ming Jui. You can also call me Andy, my English name. I have always been gravitated by the charm of biology, especially about the gene and its application. This is my first time to take part in such a majestic competition. I feel honored to join our team and regarded it as a precious chance to improve my personal growth and promote strength. In my opinion, IGEM is so meaningful that it provides a stage for us to create something realistic and beneficial to the world .Although it is a long and hard way to go, I am inspired by my dream that I can be the change of this world.
