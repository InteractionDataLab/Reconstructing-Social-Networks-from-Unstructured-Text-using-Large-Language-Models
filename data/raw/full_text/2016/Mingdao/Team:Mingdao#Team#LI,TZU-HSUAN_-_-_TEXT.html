LI,TZU-HSUAN
Record & Wiki
My name is TZU-HSUAN LEEï¼ŒI am a pleasant girl from Taiwan. Sometimes, people think I am weird because of my strange behavior. To put it briefly, I am a naughty and crazy girl to the marrow of my bones. I have intense enthusiasm on things that interested to me. Also, I am talented for drawing and designing because of my marvelous pair of hands. I won the third place in the designer competition last month. However, these are not the reasons that I decide to become one of the IGEM members. What is life? Life is to enjoy, do something you love and make it colorful. But, of course, we need to be conscientious doing everything. And it is why I am here, why I am willing to spend my precious time on IGEM. In IGEM, we can make good use of our imagination and create things that are individual, and of course, to improve the life of people and animal. In IGEM, I believe that everyone should know one thing, ''There is nothing impossible, but something unbelievable!!''
