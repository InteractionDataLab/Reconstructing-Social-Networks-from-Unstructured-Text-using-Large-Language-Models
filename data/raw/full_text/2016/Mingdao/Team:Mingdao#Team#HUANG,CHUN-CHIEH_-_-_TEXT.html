Experiment
In school life Iâ€™m confused of the purpose of learning. Perhaps we can get good grades on tests, but we never know how to use them. However, when it comes to iGEM everything becomes different. We are using English instead of Chinese learning biology! Beyond this, we not only learn the knowledge from books, but also actually use the equipment to do experiments. For a student from Taiwan this is definitely a precious opportunity, this is why I joined iGEM. For the first time ever, as a sixteen year old teen I realized that I may got the ability to change the world by synthetic biology with my teammates in iGEM.
