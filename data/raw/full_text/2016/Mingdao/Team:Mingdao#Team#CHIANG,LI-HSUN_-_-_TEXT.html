CHIANG,LI-HSUN
Experiment
I am currently studying at Mingdao High School. I like reading. In fact, reading is actually most of my life. Besides popular novels, I like to read books about the economic theories, Chinese medicine and Chinese history.
I joined the iGEM because I want to learn the technology in the field of molecular biology with great details. After joining iGEM, I found that the things I read from the text books are so shallow.
I believe that iGEM is a competition that requires many peopleâ€™s effort to create new things that can improve our quality of life. This way, changing the world would not just be a slogan.
