Robot
Hi, my name is Daniel. I like to social with people from different countries, and learn something new. I have good talent in making robots or machine. I had participated in some robot competitions like WRO, FLL, and FTC. Also I am the creator of our team's mascot which is called Ivan Curious. Ivan will walk around the venue, so you can follow him and he will lead you to our booth. The reason that I join the iGEM team is because of my interest towards biology. I want to combine medical science with our iGEM product and help more people around the world.
