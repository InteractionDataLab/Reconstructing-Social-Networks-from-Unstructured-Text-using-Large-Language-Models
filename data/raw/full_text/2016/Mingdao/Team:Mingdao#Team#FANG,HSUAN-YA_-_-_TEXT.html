Wiki Leader & Art Leader
Hi! I am Catherine Fang from Mingdao High School, Taiwan. I am outgoing person and I always like to become friends with everyone. However, I like to challenge myself too; this also one of the reason of why I joined iGEM. Since I am quite interesting in computer science, my job in our team is mostly the programming of our website and a part of the art works. I am also very enthusiastic in synthetic biology and doing experiments. Before joining iGEM, I was working on a project about the transforming heat-resistant gene into the symbiodinium of coral reef. Even though I didnâ€™t succeed this project, however, it gave me a lot of experience of those experiments which is also used in our iGEM project. I am really glad to participate in Mingdao iGEM 2016 and see you soon in the Giant Jamboree in Boston!
