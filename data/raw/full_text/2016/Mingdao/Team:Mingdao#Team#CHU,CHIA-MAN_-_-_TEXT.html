CHU,CHIA-MAN
Human Practice
My name is Chu Chia-Man and my English name is Jessica, a vivacious sixteen-year-old senior high school student, who lives in Taichung, Taiwan. I love to travel and make friends, besides, music is indispensable in my life. I'm fortunate enough to join Mingdao iGEM team and get to know all my amazing teammates. Holding a positive attitude towards life, I'm always keen on everything that I've been working on. For me, iGEM is  a great opportunity to not only improve my biological knowledge and all the experimental stills, but also learn how to work with people well and solve problems together. Make hay while the sun shines~
