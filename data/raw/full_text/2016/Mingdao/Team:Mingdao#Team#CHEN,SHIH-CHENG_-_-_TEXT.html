CHEN,SHIH-CHENG
Wiki
My name is CHEN, SHIH-CHEN. Or you can call my English name Erick. I am a senior student from Mingdao high school in Taiwan, hoping to travel all over the world and make friends with all of you. In my spare time, I like to listen to music, and sing songs. My favorite singer and band are Jay Chou and Nine one one. Jay Chou is so talented that he wrote a lot of wonderful songs. And Nine one one is a Taiwanese band whose songs are so close to the Taiwanese native culture. Another crazy hobby is playing basketball, I also like to watch NBA competition, and my favorite team is San Antonio Spurs. Their team work always looks so beautiful.  I am interested in biology and life science. That why I join in the iGEM team. I want to discover more beauty about living things and driven my curiosity on it. I think I am an outgoing man, so my work in our iGEM team is human practice. Iâ€™m glad to make friends with you who are interested in biology or have the same hobbies as mine.
