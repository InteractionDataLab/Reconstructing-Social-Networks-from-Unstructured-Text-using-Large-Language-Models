The online survey played a major part in our Human Practice. The survey was designed concerning the sobriety test. The information below we recieved from this survey helped us design our experiments and improve our product. In this survey, we used Google Charts and invited 429 people(consisting of 276 females and 153 males) that are over 21 years old.
Among these people, 73.9 percent had experience of taking the breathalyzer test, but 52 percent of them were either neutral or distrusted the test.Their biggest concerns were that test results may be influenced by individual metabolic variety or diseases or disorders. Other factors such as medicines and drugs, the profession of the police, and antiseptic mouthwash also influenced the test results.
So, we asked them to choose the samples they thought was most reliable for sobriety testing, and 86 percent of the people chose the blood test. Then, we investigated on peopleâ€™s willingness of taking the field sobriety test using blood samples, and found that 53 percent were unwilling because of the complicated process (e.g., going to hospital), time wasted, fear of pain, and distrust in policemen. Instead, they prefered devices that were easily operated, cheap, portable, accurate, and time saving.
Surprisingly, the blood glucose meter (BGM) met all these advantages. So we thought of applying these advantages to the blood alcohol meter. Finally, we asked the most significant question: Would you be willing to use a blood alcohol meter with all these advantages? The amount of people willing to take the test grew from 47 percent to 80 percent. In order to solve the problems of the public, we invented the iMeter (IGEM BLOOD ALCOHOL METER)- a blood alcohol meter that met the demands of the public. We hope that the iMeter can successfully stop drunk driving and benefit the human beings.
