In the following experiments to prove the concept, we tested the gene expression system by a reporter gene (GFP) and analyzed AOX gene expression by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Furthermore, we examined AOX enzyme activity by H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> assay, a product generated in the process of the oxidation of alcohol catalyzed by AOX. Finally, we designed a prototype to demonstrate the application of AOX enzyme on the alcohol meter in an electrochemical simulator. </P></DIV><DIV class="procontent"><P>The AOX gene were cloned onto pSB1C3 driven by a constitutive promoter (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J23101">BBa_J23101</A>) and RBS (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_B0034">BBa_B0034</A>) and fused with bacterial outer membrane proteins, Lpp-OmpA (LO) to display protein on the cell surface of E. coli. To test whether the gene expression system works, we cloned a reporter gene (GFP) in the same context (i.e., Pcons-RBS-LO-GFP/pSB1C3). And the gene expression level was compared to Pcons-RBS-GFP/pSB1C3 (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1694035">BBa_K1694035</A>) got from NCTU-Formosa, which has the same promoter and RBS but without LO. The clones of E. coli DH5α were cultured in LB media supplemented with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37°C overnight. Because overnight cultured LB medium has a background level of fluorescence, the bacterial GFP was measured in the PBS buffer (<A href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11118595">Enzyme Microb Technol. 2001</A>). As Figure 1 showed, the GFP expression was extremely high in E. coli. LO-GFP fusion protein expression was observed at low but significant level compared to wild-type E. coli or E. coli expressing LO outer membrane proteins.</P><DIV class="propic5"><P>Figure 1: Gene expression analysis.

The overnight-cultured E. coli were centrifuged and lysed with <A href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/Endy:E._coli_Western_Blot">Lysis Buffer</A> (12.5 mM Tris pH 6.8, 4% SDS). The resulting lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE with a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 for 2 hours and destained until the protein bands were clear. As the data showed in Figure 2, LO protein was expressed at around the estimated molecular weight of 17 kDa, LO-AOX fusion protein at 91 kDa and AOX protein at 79 kDa. The protein expression level was consistent with the data of GFP in Figure 1, demonstrating the low gene expression level of a LO fusion protein. However, so far we cannot confirm whether LO fusion protein is able to direct AOX or GFP proteins displayed on the cell surface of E. coli. We’re planning to do a subcellular fractionation to separate the outer membrane proteins for analysis in the future.</P><DIV class="propic5"><P>Figure 2: AOX protein analysis.

AOX catalyzes the oxidation of alcohol in the following chemical reaction C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>OH + O<SUB>2</SUB> → CH<SUB>3</SUB>CHO + H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> and generates hydrogen peroxide. We’d like to measure the production of hydrogen peroxide to demonstrate AOX enzyme activity. Fluorimetric Hydrogen Peroxide Assay Kit of <A href="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/mak165?lang=en&amp;region=TW">Sigma-Aldrich</A> was used for the study. In the kit, the red peroxidase substrate is designed to react with hydrogen peroxide to generate red fluorescence signal that can be detected at Ex/Em = 540/590 nm in the microplate reader. First, a serial dilution of hydrogen peroxide was tested to see if the kit works in our lab. As Figure 3 showed, the three-fold serial dilutions of hydrogen peroxide from 10 to 0.014 μM were linearly correlated to red fluorescence intensity, demonstrating H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> concentration can be measured using this kit in our lab.</P><DIV class="propic5"><P>Figure 3: H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> assay. The concentrations (μM) of hydrogen peroxide were measured at red fluorescence intensity unit (RFU) [Ex/Em = 540/590 nm]. The serial dilutions of hydrogen peroxide were tested and correlated to red fluorescence intensity. </P></DIV><P> </P><P> </P><P>Next, we examined the activity of AOX enzyme by measuring H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> production from the oxidation of ethanol. We prepared 1ml of overnight cultured E. coli displaying LO-AOX enzyme. The bacteria were centrifuged and resolved in Assay Buffer provided by the Sigma-Aldrich kit. Then, the resulting lysates were mixed with the increasing concentrations of ethanol from 0%, 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.075%, 0.10%, 0.15% to 0.2% for 3 minutes at room temperature. The tested alcohol concentrations were at the range from 0.03% (the alcohol law limit for safety driving) to 0.2% (people may lose consciousness at this level). The following procedure was according to the manufacture’s instruction. The data were read out at Ex/Em = 540/590 nm in the microplate reader (BioTek Microplate Spectrophotometer). As Figure 4 showed, the intensities of AOX activity were significantly and linearly correlated to the concentration of ethanol in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicated that LO-AOX enzyme we produced has a functional enzyme activity and reacted with alcohol concentration dose-dependently, implying we can use this assay to measure the unknown sample of alcohol. Although we cannot make sure whether AOX enzyme was displayed on the cell surface of E. coli or not in this moment. In addition, it is noted that according to the manufacture’s instruction, the substrate (ethanol), bacteria (E. coli) or LO-expressed E. coli has a basal level of fluorescence intensity. To count the measures clearly, you should subtract the background intensity.  </P><DIV class="propic5"><P>Figure 4: AOX enzyme activity assay.
