Human Practice
Hello everyone, I’m Tingo, a seventeen-year-old student. My interests include appreciating classical music, reading science fiction novels, and playing badminton. As a project manager, I have to absorb enough knowledge and turn it into numerous practical ideas. The reasons I wanted to participate in iGEM is that I am interested in biology, and I want to use what I’ve learnt to change the world; besides, the competition may add spice into my senior high school life, and even make my whole life different. In iGEM team not only can I meet people who like biology as well and arouse sparks within discussion, but I can also learn how to work with my teammates and finish experiments with cooperation. Since genetic engineering is a potential industry, which can improve the world in medical, agricultural, environmental domains, I want to learn more about the industry in advance so that I have more time exploring the world of genetic engineering. I hope that everyone can benefit from this magical technology.
