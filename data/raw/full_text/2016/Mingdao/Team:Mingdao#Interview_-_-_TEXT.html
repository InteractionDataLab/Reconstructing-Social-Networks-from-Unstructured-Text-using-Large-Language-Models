This year, our project is closely related to drunk driving, so it is definitely necessary for us to go to the court and learn laws associated with drunk driving. The first thing we did when arriving the court is to have a class with the judge, Mr. Yu, who informed us about the basic knowledge about the laws associated with drunk driving. Drunk driving could lead to a minimum penalty of being fined and maximum penalty of being sentenced to jail. I am shocked to know how severe the penalty for drunk driving can get. After acknowledging the severity of the punishment, I doubted if anyone would have want to drunk drive anymore. Today, I had gained an in-depth understanding towards drunk driving. I would also like to encourage people not to drive after drinking, and not to drink while driving. Also, we took part in an actual civil litigation and criminal indictment in the court. The agitation of the witnesses, rationality of the prosecutor, the confidence of the lawyer, and the justice of the judge had stunned us. We were all shocked by the amount of efforts and money needed to open a court session, which really made us think that judges must have great patience. We also shot the video of our project in the court. Last but not least, we would like to remind everyone to give us some support while watching the video.
In a late afternoon on July the first , we visited the Changhua Yuanlin police department. During our visit, we interviewed the vice chief of the Changhua Yuanlin police department, and also asked him about problems regarding the sobriety  test for drunk driving. Then, he introduced us how breathalyzer is used to evaluate whether one is drunk or not. Afterwards, we learned about the actual procedure of a sobriety test. Police officer will first use devices that look kind of like a traffic stick to estimate the blood alcohol content from a simple breath that will not require physical contact with the device. If the person taking the test exceeds the legal limit, then he or she will need to receive a different test which involves direct contact with the device. After the interview, we finished shooting our drama under the help of the police officers from the Changhua Yuanlin police department.
To know more about drunk driving, we came up with an idea to visit a wine expert and ask for the opinion for our project. On August 20th, we visited Mr. Liang-Chi Yang who is an experienced wine taster for many years. We asked Mr. Yang whether one’s alcohol tolerance can be increased over time by drinking alcohol regularly. His answer was that it’s true. Working as a wine taster and drinking different types of wine everyday enable him to tolerate more alcohol than others. This means he wouldn’t be easily drunk. Mr. Yang also told us that everyone has different alcohol tolerance. When the amount of alcohol exceed one can tolerate, you will be drunk. And the tip to make yourself avoid being drunk is to control the amount of alcohol you drink and to know how much alcohol will make you drunk. Working as a wine taster and having an adapted body condition, Mr. Yang also told us not to drink and drive, and it’s better take public transportation after drinking. “The more you drink, the more dangerous you are while driving. Even a little wine will cause tragedies!”
Since our project is closely related to drunk driving, we went to the court and learned about laws associated with drunk driving in the morning of July 1st. After arriving at the court, Mr. Yu, a judge, gave us a lecture about the laws concerning drunk driving. Drunk driving could lead to a minimum penalty of being fined and a maximum of being sentenced to jail. I was shocked that the penalty for drunk driving could get so high. If people understood the severity of the punishment, I doubt if anyone would ever dare to drunk drive. That day, I gained an in-depth understanding towards drunk driving. I’d also like to encourage drivers to not drive while drunk. Also, we visited the civil and criminal trial processes; we were stunned by the agitation of the witnesses, the rationality of the prosecutor, the confidence of the lawyer, and the justice of the judge. We admired the patience of the judges, and were also appalled by the amount of efforts and money needed to run a court session. Last but not least, we shot a video of our project in the court, so we hope that everyone could give us some support while watching the video!
