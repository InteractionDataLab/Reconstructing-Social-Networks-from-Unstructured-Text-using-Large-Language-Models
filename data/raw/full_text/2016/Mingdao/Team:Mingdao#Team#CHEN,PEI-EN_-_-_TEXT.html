I'm Mariss, a student in Mingdao High School, Taiwan. I like to listen to classical music, especially music from the late romantic era, like Mahler and Tchaikovsky. The reason that I joined iGEM is quite simple. I am a procrastinator, so here I am. I'm a person who would do nothing when there is no pressure on me; therefore I need some teammates to push me forward. Honestly, I'm not that kind of person who is crazy about molecular biology or even just biology, but in iGEM, I feel like being involved in these activities because it is so much fun!  In the team, my job is to take photos of our lab life, record those wonderful times since I've been interested in photography for quite a time and had taken some really great pictures. I will do my best! For more stories in my daily life, follow me on Instagram @jansons2016 ~~~
