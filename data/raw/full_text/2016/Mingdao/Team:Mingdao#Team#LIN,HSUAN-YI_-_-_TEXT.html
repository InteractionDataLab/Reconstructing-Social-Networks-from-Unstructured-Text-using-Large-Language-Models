LIN,HSUAN-YI (Teddy)
Team Leader, Experiment
Hi guys. My name is Teddy. I’m a student from Mingdao high school and also a member in the Mingdao iGEM team of 2016. I consider myself an energetic person, who’s always full of energy and willing to do or try the things I’m interested in. Just take English pop songs for instance. Devoting a lot of time to listening to pop songs, my friends regard me as a big mad fan of those songs. Except for music, I’m also really into almost all kinds of sports, including basketball, soccer and swimming. I enjoy the feeling of playing sports and it also helps me relieve my stress.
Being good at science and math (and also interested in, of course), I decided to join in the iGEM team in Mingdao. I think it’s one of the places where I can bring my abilities to bear and show my talents. Also, in my opinion, it’s one of the methods to change the world, even just a little. In addition, I can share my ideas and meet people who have a lot of good ideas. That’s what aroused my passion toward iGEM and also the reason why I’m typing this now. I’m really looking forward to meeting you guys soon.Bye.
