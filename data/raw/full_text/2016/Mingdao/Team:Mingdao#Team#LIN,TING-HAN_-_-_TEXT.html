LIN,TING-HAN
Human Practice
Hello, my name is Stephen Lin. I like playing sports, reading novels, and of course, synthetic biology. It's been a great honour to be in an iGem team. I think what iGem brings me is that I get to know both how synthetic biology works and how we solve tasks at the same time. As an iGemer, I fully recommend people all around the world to participate the activity.
