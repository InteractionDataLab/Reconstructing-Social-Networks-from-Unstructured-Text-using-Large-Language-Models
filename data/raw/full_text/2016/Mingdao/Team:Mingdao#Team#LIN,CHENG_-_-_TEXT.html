Human practice
My name is Jeff, a fifteen-year-old high school student. I have a wild range of interests including biology, scout activities, playing the flute, playing sports and so on. Since I’ve been deeply interested in biology, I made up my mind to get involved in our school’s iGEM team immediately after the moment I encounter the iGEM. While participating in the team, I learnt not only specialized knowledge, but also leadership, organizational capabilities, presentation skills, etc, which is the main reason I participated in the team. My assignment in the team is the human practice, which means that I should promote our team and the iGEM to the public, letting more people comprehend what we, the iGEMers, are working on. Age is just a number. Members of our team all try their best in areas of our own specialties in order to reach the summit of the team, wishing to have a successful experiment as well as a best performance in the competition.
