Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab?</B><P>E. coli lab strains (DH5α and BL21) have no known survival mechanisms outside the lab culture, and they only caused minimal harm to people or environment. Therefore, they are considered to be safe and practical for research. The only excluded condition is horizontal gene transfer. In our project, the gene products were oxidoreductase enzymes, AOX, which catalyze the oxidation of primary alcohol. The enzymes have been used in many biotech and industrial applications and supposed not to be dangerous to the health of our members.</P><B>B. Risks to the safety and health of the general public if released by design or accident?</B><P>Our genetically engineered bacteria producing alcohol oxidase enzymes would be used on the sample test strip of the Blood Alcohol Meter, an electrochemical analyzer like Blood Glucose Meter seen as household items. If released by accident, the E.coli has no survival mechanisms in the environment and cannot spread spores or reproduce in the gut of an organism, so it has low threat to the public. By design, the bacteria will be killed in the process of standard sterilization process before depositing them to the test strip. The test strip we created will not contain any live GE bacteria, therefore it won’t have risks to the safety and health of the general public.</P><B>C. Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident?</B><P>If so, the E. coli lab strain no longer has survival fitness outside the lab. And the DNA plasmids are maintained by high concentrations of antibiotics like chloramphenicol and kanamycin in our case, thus they will disappear and be degraded in the absent of antibiotics if there’s horizontal gene transfer concern. In addition, we always killed all the materials including bacteria by standard autoclave procedure before letting them leave the lab, so it won’t cause any risk to environment quality.</P><B>D. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states?</B><P>Our bacteria will only be alive in production process, it will be killed right away after placing it on the test strip. A Blood Alcohol Meter will not contain any live bacteria we produced. And the genes on the plasmid vector maintained by antibiotics are supposed not to be present for a long time in a normal environment. Moreover, the gene encodes an oxidoreductase enzyme used by the methylotrophic yeast in nature. The gene products are not harmful to human and the environment.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
