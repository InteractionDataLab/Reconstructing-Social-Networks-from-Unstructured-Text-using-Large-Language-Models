YU,CHIA-YUN
Record
My name is Chia-yun Yu, I am from Taiwan Mingdao High School. I am very shy to talk to strangers, but I also like to make friends and socialize with my team members a lot. I also like to help others. I have been to the north Thailand to do volunteering work during the summer vacation. My hobby is to play sports. I love to play table tennis and basketball the most in my free time. I decided to join Mingdao iGEM team because I am interested in biology. I can learn a lot of knowledge about biology while participating in the iGEM. Also, I really enjoy doing experiment. Although I had done many experiments before, I have never done the experiment of gene engineering. I think it will be a lot of fun. My job in the team is to record what we do every day. I think I am very suitable for this work because I am very good at it. I am very glad to be a part of the iGEM family.
