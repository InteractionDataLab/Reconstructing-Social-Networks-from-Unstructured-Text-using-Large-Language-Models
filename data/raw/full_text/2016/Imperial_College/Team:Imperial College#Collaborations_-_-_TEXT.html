City of London School - Wiki
We provided equipment and cells such as dual host vector for cyanobacteria, competent cells for transformations, blue light box for gel visualisation and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 culture. We also gave advice on cloning strategies and protocols to use and wiki. Finally we gave them advice on their presentation for the Jamboree.
They tested our Go-Culture game on PC and touch devices. They provided great feedback on how to improve the game such as integrating a tutorial, making some levels simpler, fixing the background of the platformer level so that the player can easily see which platforms move up and down. They also promoted the game within their school.
Toulouse - Wiki
We recorded voice overs for English version of their protocol videos. The videos explain how to perform a PCR, DNA ligation, bacterial transformation and enzymatic digestion. We added the edited audio to the videos.  The videos can be found on the iGEM Toulouse Youtube channel.
They ran growth experiment following our standardised protocol for Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis. The team added the resulting growth data to our A.L.I.C.E software. Toulouse wrote a study on the optimum growth conditions of Bacillus subtilis (strain WT 168), and Pseudomonas fluorescens (strain SBW25) which are available in PDF format. Click here to view.
XMU-China - Wiki
We wrote a small description of our project and our team for their September newsletter. You can find the Newsletter here: click here
They ran growth experiments following our standardised protocol for Escherichia coli and Halomonas. The growth data was sent to us via email and was then added to our A.L.I.C.E software.
Surveys and Newsletters
We wrote a small description of our project and our team for EPFL's newsletter.
We filled in the Survey for LMU and TU Munich iGEM Team
We filled in the RRI Survey for Paris-Saclay iGEM Team
We filled in the UCL iGEM 2016 Collaboration survey for the UCL iGEM Team
Growth Data for A.L.I.C.E
NRP-UEA-Norwich
BioWires has accepted to conduct growth experiments to populate the  A.L.I.C.E. software.These experiments were done with Shewanella oneidensis at three different temperatures (30°C, 33.5°C and 37°C).
British Columbia
The UBC iGEM team sent us growth data that is now stored in our A.L.I.C.E. software. They conducted these growth experiments over a pH range of 6 values for two bacterial species: Caulobacter and Escherichia coli.
Evry
The Evry iGEM team has conducted growth experiments with Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Their data has then been added to our A.L.I.C.E. software. Their experiment involved tracking the growth rate of their bacteria at 30°C. They also sent us some data, which  they gathered during their project on the growth of Pseudomonas putida in minimal media with different carbon sources: glucose, glycerol and benzoic acid.
CGU_Taiwan
The CGU Taiwan iGEM team has kindly sent us some growth data, which has now been uploaded on our A.L.I.C.E. software. The experiments were conducted for two concentrations of LB medium, and with two different strains of Escherichia coli: BL21 and DH5α.
Columbia_NYU
The Columbia-NYU iGEM team has performed some growth experiments for us with two different strains of Pseudomonas putida. The experiments were conducted in 11 different mixed LB and BHI media. Their data is now populating our A.L.I.C.E. software.
