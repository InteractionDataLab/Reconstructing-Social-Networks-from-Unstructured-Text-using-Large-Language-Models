Documented at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to our project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry. BBa_K1893010 (STAR) BBa_K1893009 (STAR Reporter) BBa_K1893016 (AraBAD + gp2)).
Silver
Validated Part: ( BBa_K1893010 (STAR) BBa_K1893009 (STAR Reporter) BBa_K1893016 (AraBAD + gp2)).
Collaboration: This year we have collaborated with 12 iGEM teams, details of which can be found on our collaborations page
Some of our contributions include filling in surveys for LMU, TU Munich, Paris Saclay and the UCL iGEM teams and providing technical support and equipment for the City of London high school team.

Improve a previous part or project: We have improved 5 parts in our project. All of our parts can be found here:
BBa_C0062 - luxR repressor/activator
BBa_C0071 - rhlR repressor/activator from P. aeruginosa PA3477
BBa_C0079 - lasR activator from P. aeruginosa PAO1
BBa_C0077 - cinR activator from Rhizobium leguminosarum
BBa_K1321333 - pSB-AraC-pBAD
In our proof of concept, we transformed two cell populations with different chromoproteins. The cells expressing the chromoproteins were mixed to form new colours from various co-cultures. We also found that different chromoproteins placed varied loads on the the cell populations, resulting in different growth rates, so that, if grown together, one coloured population would likely outcompete the other. Our Genetically Engineered Artificial Ratio (G.E.A.R.) system could work to maintain the colour of the co-culture by slowing the growth of the faster growing population.
