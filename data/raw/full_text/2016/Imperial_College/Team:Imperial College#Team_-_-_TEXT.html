Our team is composed of 12 members. Half of our team comes from the Department of Life Science, the other half come from the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial.  Our chosen disciplines span from biochemistry to biomedical engineering.
Here are some need-to-know facts about Imperial’s 2016 team
Biggest Challenge: Not boiling cell cultures in the incubator (don’t ask, it’s been done before)
Team Communication Strategy: Open lines of communication are important. We believe gifs, vines, and interpretive dances are better than words and talking.
Ideal Collaboration: A team which also enjoys long walks on the beach and candlelit dinners.
Things We Understand About iGEM: Synthetic biology is exciting, GFP will verify anything, and building a wiki is insane
