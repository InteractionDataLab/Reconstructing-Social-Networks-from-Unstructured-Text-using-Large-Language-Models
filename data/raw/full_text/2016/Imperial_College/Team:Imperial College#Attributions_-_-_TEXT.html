This year our team consisted of 6 bioengineers and 6 life scientists. We are an interesting demonstration of human co-cultures! We bring different people and knowledge together, among many other things. We decided on our project idea during the first half of July, after a month of intense and independent brainstorming process. Unless otherwise stated, all the experiments, constructs, code, wiki and results documented on our Wiki were performed, written and collected by us, ecolibrium!
General Support
We would like to thank the members of the Centre for Synthetic Biology and Innovation (CSynBI), who provided us with feedback and advice on how to improve our project throughout the whole summer.
Special thanks to Nicolas Kylilis for the long hours he spent supervising us in the lab and his valuable help throughout the project.
Dr Kirsten Jensen supervised us in the lab and put us in contact with many of our sponsors and collaborators.
Dr Karen Polizzi patiently guided us along our iGEM journey. She especially gave us advice in the lab.
Dr Guy-Bart Stan supported us at every step of iGEM, ready to listen to all our concerns and encouraging us to find coherent solutions. He also advised us on our modelling strategies.
Prof Richard Kitney and Prof Paul Freemont inspired us to design a project that we are passionate about, and to consider its impact on our society.
Lab and Modelling Support
Imperial College Foundry - Kealan Exley, Chris Hirst and David Todd Jones allowed us to use their characterisation platform so we could run growth experiments.
Dr Matthew Bennett kindly advised on the design and modelling of the Cin and Rhl parts.
Dr James Chappell advised us on STAR.
Dr James Macdonald and Professor Eric Klavins helped us with gro programming language and simulator developed by the University of Washington.
Human Practices Support
Victoria Geaney kindly organised the meetings we had with students from the Royal College of Art, School of Materials and School of Design.
MA and PhD students from the Royal College of Art helped us come up with ideas during our brainstorming process. They reviewed our data visualisation strategies and advised us on how to improve them.
Dr. Robert Smith advised and reviewed our Human Practices strategies.
Dr. Erik Fisher, Dr. Emma Frow, Dr. Jane Calvert, and Mr. Alberto Aparicio advised us on how to best implement the STIR protocol and reflexivity to our project.
Emily Newton-Dunn advised us on the design, storyboarding and game mechanics for our Go Culture game. Click here to learn more.
Dr Jenna Stevens-Smith helped us obtain a space to present our project at the New Scientist Live from the 23 to the 25 of September.
Dr Stephen Chambers invited us to participate in the Lean Launchpad, which greatly help us to rethink our marketing strategy.
