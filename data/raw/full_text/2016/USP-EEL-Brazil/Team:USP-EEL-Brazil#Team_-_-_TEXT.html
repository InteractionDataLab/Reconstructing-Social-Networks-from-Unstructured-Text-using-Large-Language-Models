Our participation in the iGEM was shaped by our academy interest in molecular and synthetic biology as well as our Synthetic Biology Club (Clube de Biologia Sintética EEL) interest to interact and collaborate with other undergraduate students clubs around the world.  Our club will make its very first appearance in the iGEM 2016, and we are excited about that. The iGEM project we have for 2016, is the E.coil project. Our team consists of undergraduate students majoring in Engineering, as well as, Ph.D students and principal investigators deeply involved in molecular biology and chemical engineering research and education projects.
The EEL-USP team for the iGEM 2016 has the following members!
ANDRÉ HERMANN
André Hermann is in his 3rd year of Biochemical Engineering at University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. He's working with Professor Fernando Segato on production and expression of heterologous proteins in fungi since 2015. Originally from the mountains of Rio de Janeiro (a city called Petrópolis), he has come to Lorena with all of his enthusiasm for science and created the Synthetic Biology Club on 2014. He's also known as "Dedé dos Fungos" and his hobbies includes hiking and dancing. He's hype about someday creating his own business related to biotechnology, a true entrepreneur indeed!
ALINE GONÇALVES
Aline Gonçalves has a degree in Biological Sciences and is currently a Master's student in Industrial Biotechnology at the University of São Paulo (USP). Her research interests include molecular biology, biotechnology, genetics and synthetic biology.
LEONARDO FERREIRA
Born in Rio de Janeiro, Leonardo is a Chemical Engineering undergraduate student at University of São Paulo, Brazil (EEL-USP). He is interested in technology and a wide range of subjects, like synthetic biology, astronomy, engineering, physics and computer science. He has experience working with aerospace engineering, studying methods to approach Kepler’s Equation in near parabolic orbits. He is currently a member of the Synthetic Biology Club and the Chemical Engineering Academic Center at EEL-USP. He is also interested in business and entrepreneurship, as well as social entrepreneurship, dreaming about one day creating his own business.
HEMERSON SULPICIO
Hemerson Sulpicio is a undergraduate student at University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. He has a wide range of interests that includes genetics, synthetic biology, medicine, sports, music, brewing and cooking. Hemerson also likes to observe, and sometimes, create some chaos!!
TAMIRES SOUZA
Tamires is keen on the idea of modifying microorganisms with engineering concepts and her anxiety with all the project really got everybody moving. She's in her 3rd year of Biochemical Engineering at University of Sao Paulo (USP), and her interests includes working in a biotechnological manufacturing production and skateboarding. Although she seems tough and wants everybody to think exactly that out of her, she really has a big heart and cares for the team. Unfortunately, she won't be able to attend the Jamboree, but her spirit will be there cheering for the team!
SABRYNE RODRIGUES
Sabryne Rodrigues, born in the mountains of Paraíba Valley, São Paulo. She is studying biochemical engineering. Love genetics and cosmetology and  is developing a project of a free online course in synthetic biology, with Professor Segato. You wouldn't like to see her angry! She's the one who keep everybody in line and at the same time has the sensibility that enabled her to create all the art of the team. Despite the fact that everybody feared her a little bit, she's really a sweetheart and just wanted everything to get in order!
RODOLFO ANTONIO
Borned in the State of Minas Gerais-Brazil, Rodolfo came to Sao Paulo state to study Chemical Engineering at University of São Paulo, Brazil. His interests include syntethic biology, enviromental technologies, sustainability, technology, and science. He likes to work in projects and make the difference.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS
PROFESSOR FERNANDO SEGATO
Professor Segato graduated with a B.Sc. degree in Pharmacy-Biochemistry (USP). He also holds a Doctorate degree in Genetics and Molecular Biology (USP). Before joining the Biotechnology Department at University of Sao Paulo-Brazil, Dr. Segato worked as a pos-doc at the Oklahoma State University (OU) and as a researcher at the Technical Research Center of Finland (VTT). His research interests include: genetics and molecular biology of microorganisms, production and expression of heterologous proteins, RNAi, proteome and transcriptome characterization of microorganisms that degrade lignocellulose.
PROFESSOR JÚLIO CESAR
Professor Júlio holds a B.Sc. and a doctorate degree in Chemical Engineering (USP).  Dr. Júlio has experience in biochemical process and his research interests include : bioreactors, lipases, chemical modification of oils and fats,  and conversion of sugarcane bagasse into xylitol.
