Thank You!!
Without these people, all of this would not have been possible, we really appreciate them!
Thomas Howard and Christoph Albermann, the authors of the researches in which we widely based all our work on. Both of them took time to talk to us, give advice and even some data. We are really grateful for their attention.
Professor André Ferraz, one of the very few people in the university to support us and actively help.
Professor Arnaldo Prata, who also believed in us and would be glad to land a hand whenever we needed.
Professor Heizir Castro, who always gave us useful material, advice and even reagents
Professor Domingos Giordani and Victor Silva, who helped us with some analyzes and tests.
All the other university's professors and staff who helped us with our tasks or questions
Flávia Araújo Sousa from EMS, who we first met and created all the communication path to them.
All the lab staff, who were always nice to us, even when we were bothering them.
All the members from CBSin.
