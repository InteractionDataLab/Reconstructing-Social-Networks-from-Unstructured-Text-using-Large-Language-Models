2014 Kyoto
2014 Cornell
Week 1 (6/27 - 7/2)
6/27
Cancer Group
PCR of 3xHA-TDGF1 construct. 12 cycles
Gel of PCR Product → PCR was a failure. Band was 300bp. Should have been 750bp
Second PCR of 3xHA-TDGF1 construct. 25 cycles instead of 12 → left overnight
Vaccine Group
Things
Interlab Study
Measured LUDOX and H2O for plate reader
Transformation of positive and negative controls, test devices 1-3
6/28
Cancer Group
Ran gel on PCR of yesterday's construct → Gel worked
Gel purification of PCR Product → low concentration of DNA found during nanodrop
PCR the construct using a revised method
2:54pm → ran the gel on the PCR product
Vaccine Group
Things
Interlab Study
Heat and "SB" streaking seems not to have worked
No visible red colonies on plate
6/29
Cancer Group
PCR Not working well → keep trying new methods with different annealing temperatures
Tried 65 and 67 degrees C
Vaccine Group
Things
Interlab Study
FITC started
Cutting re-inoculated
Ordered new LUDOX

College of Arts and Sciences Pre College Summer Institute students stopped by lab
Spoke to them about information on synthetic biology and iGEM
6/30
Cancer Group
PCR worked → Test 5 → changed annealing temperature to 66 degrees C + increased the denaturing time
Nanodropped DNA

7/7
Cancer group
Nanodrops were pretty low (84-120 ng/nl)
11:46am PCR'ed the highest nanodrop result in tube #1 → PCR successful
2:33pm → attempt to digest with remaining non-PCR product → removed from incubator at 5:00pm
Made a gel → ran PCR

Week 3 (7/11-7//15)
7/11
Cancer group
Ran PCR on the construct (5x) → gel did not work
PCR'ed 84.2 ng/ml construct

LB liquid culture (3ml with 3ul of ampicillin)
Loaded 10ul Ladder DNA.
Loaded 1ul dye + 5ul PCR product
Ran gel at 115V
Checked gel ladder → faint, no band for the PCR product
Made new gel, loaded with the same amount of reagents as before → ran at 90V → No ladder band
Ran it again at 115V → visible ladder, no PCR band
Preparing a gel to run ladder and construct that previously showed a strong band → used this to diagnose a problem with gel setup. Ran TDGF1 152.9 Phire Child. Lane 1 is ladder, Lane 2 is that construct (10ul) with 2ul of dye
Setup new PCR using the 6/30/16 PCR construct

Biobrick ideas
Smelly yeast → optimized from e. coli
Twist on smelly e. coli on e. coli → regulated with quorum sensing
OmpA/EnvZ recognize osmolarity
Genetic Circuit
Shine yellow light → Banana smell. Shine green light → wintergreen
TetR operator system genetic circuit
Have cell die at certain wavelength → killswitch
