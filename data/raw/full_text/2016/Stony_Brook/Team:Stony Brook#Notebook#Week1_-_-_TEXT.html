Week 1: 6/27-7/1
Week 1 (6/27 - 7/2)
6/27
Cancer Group
PCR of 3xHA-TDGF1 construct. 12 cycles
Gel of PCR Product → PCR was a failure. Band was 300bp. Should have been 750bp
Second PCR of 3xHA-TDGF1 construct. 25 cycles instead of 12 → left overnight
Vaccine Group
Things
Interlab Study
Measured LUDOX and H2O for plate reader
Transformation of positive and negative controls, test devices 1-3
6/28
Cancer Group
Ran gel on PCR of yesterday's construct → Gel worked
Gel purification of PCR Product → low concentration of DNA found during nanodrop
PCR the construct using a revised method
2:54pm → ran the gel on the PCR product
Vaccine Group
Things
Interlab Study
Heat and "SB" streaking seems not to have worked
No visible red colonies on plate
6/29
Cancer Group
PCR Not working well → keep trying new methods with different annealing temperatures
Tried 65 and 67 degrees C
Vaccine Group
Things
Interlab Study
FITC started
Cutting re-inoculated
Ordered new LUDOX
Other
College of Arts and Sciences Pre College Summer Institute students stopped by lab
Spoke to them about information on synthetic biology and iGEM
6/30
Cancer Group
PCR worked → Test 5 → changed annealing temperature to 66 degrees C + increased the denaturing time
Nanodropped DNA
Vaccine Group
