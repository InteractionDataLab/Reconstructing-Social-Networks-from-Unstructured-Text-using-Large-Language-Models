5ul each PCR reaction
Ladder worked but lanes were smeared
Construct was left out over the weekend, so it was probably degraded
Three PCR reactions
Ran three PCRs with similar amounts of reagents as above, except each used a different concentration of template
Outreach
Team members presented iGEM information and projects and invited people to our Building With Biology event at the Seawolves Community Movie Night
7/26
Ran a gel of the two reactions from 7/25
Gel came out poorly
