BSL-1 Organisms
Stony Brook iGEM worked with E. coli and S. cerevisiae
We complied with BSL-1 guidelines and wore the required PPE around the lab when handling those organisms
Nitrile gloves
Closed-toe shoes and long pants
UV-protective glasses/goggles for DNA gel analysis
Gloves were changed after working with said organisms to prevent cross contamination
No organisms were brought out of the lab at any time
Handling of chemicals
All chemicals, such as Ethidium Bromide and Glacial Acetic Acid were kept in specified areas and were carried in secondary containers as well to minimize risk of spilling
Biological waste was disposed of appropriately, especially if such waste included E. Coli and/or S. Cerevisiae
Non-Pathogenic Parts
Constructs ordered from IDT or otherwise synthesized were made from coding sequences that code for non-pathogenic or infectious molecules
