LB liquid culture (3ml with 3ul of ampicillin)
Loaded 10ul Ladder DNA.
Loaded 1ul dye + 5ul PCR product
Ran gel at 115V
Checked gel ladder → faint, no band for the PCR product
Made new gel, loaded with the same amount of reagents as before → ran at 90V → No ladder band
Ran it again at 115V → visible ladder, no PCR band
Preparing a gel to run ladder and construct that previously showed a strong band → used this to diagnose a problem with gel setup. Ran TDGF1 152.9 Phire Child. Lane 1 is ladder, Lane 2 is that construct (10ul) with 2ul of dye

7/13
Ran 5ul of PCR with ladder, cancer construct and vaccine construct → to diagnose problem with gel
Miniprep of Dean vector (3ml LB culture)
Purification of PCR product → nanodropped 16.4ug/ul
Nanodrop of:
Yellow 7/13 construct NEB purified → 16.4ng/ml
Blue gel purification → 48.7ng/ul
Pink PCR purification 7/13 → 102.2ng/ul
7/13 -RK Vector 1 → 48.2ng/ul

PCR of TDGF-1 IDT Construct
3 reactions set up with the same setup as test 5 from 6/30
Annealing Temperature at 66°C for 5 seconds
"Chocolate doesn't have a smell" -Ryan
BioBrick Ideas
Smelly yeast → optimized from e. coli
Twist on smelly e. coli on e. coli → regulated with quorum sensing
OmpA/EnvZ recognize osmolarity
Genetic Circuit
Shine yellow light → Banana smell. Shine green light → wintergreen
TetR operator system genetic circuit
Have cell die at certain wavelength → killswitch
7/15
Ran a gel on PCR'ed Construct
1st gel failed → Samara poured a gel onto Brian's gel
All 3 PCR products worked → purified PCR → 30ul PCR product in each tube → 150ul building buffer
