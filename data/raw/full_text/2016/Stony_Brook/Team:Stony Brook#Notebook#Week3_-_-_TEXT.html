Week 3: 7/11-7/15
Week 3 (7/11-7//15)
7/11
Cancer group
Ran PCR on the construct (5x) → gel did not work
PCR'ed 84.2 ng/ml construct
5 replicates made using Phire

Cancer group
Made gel for electrophoresis of PCR construct → it didn't work
Thermocycler Program: Same as PCR from 7/11

LB liquid culture (3ml with 3ul of ampicillin)
Loaded 10ul Ladder DNA.
Loaded 1ul dye + 5ul PCR product
Ran gel at 115V
Checked gel ladder → faint, no band for the PCR product
Made new gel, loaded with the same amount of reagents as before → ran at 90V → No ladder band
Ran it again at 115V → visible ladder, no PCR band
Preparing a gel to run ladder and construct that previously showed a strong band → used this to diagnose a problem with gel setup. Ran TDGF1 152.9 Phire Child. Lane 1 is ladder, Lane 2 is that construct (10ul) with 2ul of dye
Setup new PCR using the 6/30/16 PCR construct
98°C → 30sec
98°C → 20sec
66°C → 5sec
72°C → 30sec
72°C → 1min
4°C → hold

7/13
Cancer group
Ran 5ul of PCR with ladder, cancer construct and vaccine construct → to diagnose problem with gel
Miniprep of Dean vector (3ml LB culture)
Purification of PCR product → nanodropped 16.4ug/ul
Nanodrop of:
Yellow 7/13 construct NEB purified → 16.4ng/ml
Blue gel purification → 48.7ng/ul
Pink PCR purification 7/13 → 102.2ng/ul
7/13 -RK Vector 1 → 48.2ng/ul
7/13 -RK Vector 2 → 96.3ng/ul

Brian and Sunil's Gal promoters worked but both constructs failed
Biobrick ideas
Smelly yeast → optimized from e. coli
Twist on smelly e. coli on e. coli → regulated with quorum sensing
OmpA/EnvZ recognize osmolarity
Genetic Circuit
Shine yellow light → Banana smell. Shine green light → wintergreen
TetR operator system genetic circuit
Have cell die at certain wavelength → killswitch
