Miniprep of Dean Vector using 2-3ml
LB culture made 7/20
Centrifuged at 4500rpm for 2 minutes and 30 seconds
Centrifuged at 4500rpm for 5 minutes, lysed LB cultures
Followed NEB protocol from then on
Two gel runs
Ran two consecutive gels with Reactions 1 and 2
Gels ended up smearing
Make a serial dilution of template
Too many cycles (Maybe lower it to 25-30)
Primer concentration not optimal
