Interlab Study
Our InterLab study on the standardization of GFP fluorescence was an overall success and provided us with a fun activity with which to take our minds from the other projects we were working on. We were able to obtain very clean results across the range of our fluorescence and absorbance tests and hope that our data can help to contribute to iGEM's quest to more fully characterize the widely used GFP marker.
Absorbance values for replicates across the 6-hour data collection process. It can be seen that device 1 experienced a low level of growth across the time period compared to each of the alternative devices and controls. Determining the Abs600 for each time point in the experiment is necessary to standardize GFP fluorescence levels.
As expected, we noticed a low level of fluorescence in our readings for the negative control across all time points in the experiment. It was also seen that device 3 demonstrated a low level of GFP production in E. Coli. These raw fluorescence readings were used for the data standardization with recording Abs600 values displayed in the above graph.
This bar graph provides average FI/Abs600 readings across all controls and devices. Averages were calculated with 2 replicates of each of the controls and experimental devices. Standard deviations were calculated using an averaging of data from the two replicates for each control and device and are represented by the error whiskers on the bars.
