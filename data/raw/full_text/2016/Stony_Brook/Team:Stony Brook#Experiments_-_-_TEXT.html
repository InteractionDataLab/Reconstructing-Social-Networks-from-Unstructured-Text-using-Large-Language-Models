Add 0.5g of 1% agarose
Microwave for three 20 second intervals and cool slightly
Add 1ul Ethidium Bromide
Mix and pour into gel box. Add Comb
Cool for 30 minutes
YPD Media
For liquid media
Add 20g of Bacto peptone, 10g of yeast extract and 950mL of water to a flask
Autoclave on the liquid setting
Add 50mL of 40% glucose and mix
For solid media
Add same reagents as liquid, plus 24g of Bacto agar
