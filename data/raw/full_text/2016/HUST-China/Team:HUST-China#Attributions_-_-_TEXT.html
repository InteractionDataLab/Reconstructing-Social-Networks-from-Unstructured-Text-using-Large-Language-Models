Project Design
The project was preliminary designed by Ruihao Li, Sharey Cheng and Wangjie Liu. Also many brainstorming meetings including all the team membership were held, and then we established our whole project.
Wet Lab Work
Lin Di, Yufeng Mo, Tianxiong Xiao and Jiahui Fan primary designed the experimental scheme. Sharey Cheng and Wangjie Liu modified it and promote the whole experimental procedure. And all of these members, including Ruiyan Zhang, Sharey Cheng, Wangjie Liu, Zhenyi Guo, Zhi Zeng, Jiyue Qin, Lin Di, Yufeng Mo, Tianxiong Xiao, Guozhao Wu, Xiaoyang Li, Fengyi Li, Xiao Deng, Yiyan Yu and Yubei Sun , carried out the experiments.
Modeling
Our modeling job are mainly taken in charge by Ruihao Li, Weizhi Zhang and Yuanzhe Shao.
Wiki&Poster
All the content of this wiki were provided by HUST-China team. Wiki framework was constructed by Guojin Chen. Art and design was done by Sharey Cheng and Liangshiyu Liu. Sharey Cheng, Yufeng Mo and Junyu Ren also made a project video for our project.
