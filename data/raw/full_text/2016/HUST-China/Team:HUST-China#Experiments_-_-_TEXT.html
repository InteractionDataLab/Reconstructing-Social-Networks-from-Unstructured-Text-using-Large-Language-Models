Fig 3: Eukaryotic bi-stable function control plasmid
Transformation and Induction:
Plasmid BBaK30-pPIC9K and its control one were transformed into Pichia pastoris GS115 cells. Then they were grown in YPD medium containing 1‰ ampicillin. Methanol acts as the inducer to control the transcription of gene PP2CA. The control circuit was designed to test the ability for SnRK2.2 to phosphorylate ABF2 without PP2CA.
Fluorescence Detection:
Microplate spectrophotometer was applied to detect and quantify the expression of GFP. The strains transformed with whole circuits and their control ones are set to characterize the SnRK2.2’s function. To prove PP2CA’s function, strain containing the whole circuit will decrease GFP fluorescence intensity under the induction of methanol. Each circuit was tested with 3 parallels.

Protein and Protein Interaction
PCR:
With appropriate primers, PCR was carried out to amplify target gene CII, CIII, CII-TT, pRE-RBS and GFP-LVAtag. CII-TT and pRE-RBS were amplified using primers with overlaps to fulfill the requirements of In-Fusion.
Plasmid Construction:
Plasmid CII-TT-pRE-RBS-GFP-pSB1C3 was constructed by In-Fusion cloning method, at the same time, 3A assembly were applied to construct plasmid CIII-RBS-CIII-pSB1C3, CII-RBS-CII-pSB1C3, BBaK14-pSB1C3 and BBaK15-pSB1C3. Finally, the constructed circuits were transferred into another backbone PETDuet-1 to gain BBaK14-PETDuet-1 and BBaK15-PETDuet-1.

Transformation and Induction:
All plasmids and their control groups were transformed into E.coli DH5α cells by standard competent cell transformation method. Then they were grown in LB medium containing 1‰ ampicillin. IPTG works as the inducer to activate T7 promoter in the PETDuet-1 backbone.
Fluorescence Detection:
Microplate spectrophotometer was applied to detect and quantify GFP expression. Comparing the three-CIII tandem circuit with the three-CII tandem one, we can verify that whether CIII can inhibit Ftsh’s degradation of CII.

Transformation and Induction:
All plasmids and their control groups were transformed into E.coli DH5α cells by standard competent cell transformation method.Then they were grown in LB medium containing 1‰ ampicillin. IPTG acts as the inducer to activate T7 promoter in the PETDuet-1 backbone.
Fluorescence Detection:
Microplate spectrophotometer was applied to detect and quantify GFP expression. CII was overexpressed to eliminate the interruption of constitutive expressed FtsH. We can prove that CII serves as a transcriptional factor if GFP fluorescence intensity rises with the increasing of the number of CII repeats (BBaK15-PETDuet-1, BBaK32-PETDuet-1).
Fig 10: Proposed CII&pRE characterization result
BBaK17-PETDuet-1 was constructed to verify CI’s ability to block pR. Comparing to circuit of control group pR-RBS-GFP-LVAtag-PETDuet-1, we can prove CI’s function if GFP fluorescence intensity goes down when induced by IPTG.

It is supposed to keep lactic acid level in balance on account of iLDH activity and our designed positive feedback circuit.
