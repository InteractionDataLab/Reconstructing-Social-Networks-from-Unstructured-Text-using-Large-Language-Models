Basic Part
Following documented basic parts are respectively from three circuits this year:
Prokaryotic Version of Signal Filter
Transcriptional Regulation:

Name
Description
BBa_K2036000
RBS-CII
A protein in bacteriophage λ operon which can activate promoter RE.
BBa_K2036001
CIII
A protein in bacteriophage λ operon which can free CII from its inhibitor, FtsH.
BBa_K2036006
RBS-CIII
A protein in bacteriophage λ operon which can free CII from its inhibitor, FtsH.
Note: We didn’t submit the single parts of pRE, pRM and pR because they are too small to construct, but we have constructed and submitted the composite type of them, using GFP as the report gene in the characterization pathways.
Protein&Promoter Interaction:

Description
BBa_K2036007
RBS-CII-RBS-CII
A protein in bacteriophage λ operon which can activate promoter RE. We use tandem to amplify its function.
BBa_K2036012
RBS-CII-TT
A protein in bacteriophage λ operon which can activate promoter RE. We use tandem to amplify its function.
BBa_K2036011
pRE-GFP-LVAssrAtag
The report part of the characterization pathway and it’s used to characterize promoter RE.
BBa_K2036032
CII-TT-pRE-RBS-GFP-LVAssrAtag
To characterize function of CII.
Protein&Protein Interaction:

Description
BBa_K2036007
RBS-CII-RBS-CII
A protein in bacteriophage λ operon which can activate promoter RE. We use tandem to amplify its function.
BBa_K2036008
RBS-CIII-RBS-CIII
A protein in bacteriophage λ operon which can free CII from its inhibitor, FtsH. We use tandem to amplify its function.
BBa_K2036013
RBS-CII-TT-pRE-RBS-GFP-LVAssrAtag
To characterize CII’s function.
Note: CIII and CII circuit above shares the same assembly composition of pRE-RBS-GFP-LVAssrAtag with CII and pRE characterization circuit so the part is not listed repeatedly.
