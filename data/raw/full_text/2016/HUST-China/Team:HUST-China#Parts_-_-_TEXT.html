Parts Summary
Welcome to our achievement page of parts! This year, we focus on gene expression regulation in a track of foundational advance. Thus, well-characterized parts are important in our toolkit and very essential to our end-users.
The two versions of our signal filter and prokaryotic application circuit well support our project and are validly characterized and documented under our efforts. We submitted 36 parts totally to the Registry, 25 basic parts, 9 composite parts and 2 construction intermediates.
Sincerely,we hope these parts can contribute to the Registry and light up the future of synthetic biology creation. 
Parts are classified in the following four catalogs, click Part Number to see more details:
