Overview
With the benefit of Synthetic Biology, we have designed a filter / switch.But we urgently need to know more details about it, such as when they will switch? What is its response time to switch? How much filtering effect can it perform? Is its robustness good? ... And all of this requires our modeling and simulating to get the answer. And for our application, we are modeling the project to simulate the state of the bacteria in the intestinal tract and to improve our projects accordingly.
In order to make sure that our design could fulfill its duty, we built two mathematical models to simulate it. One model is the DDEs/ODEs model, and another model is the Diffusion model, which could predict the outcome of it.
On modeling we focus on two aspects:
1. the prokaryotic pathway and eukaryotic pathway simulation
2. the specific application of lactose intolerance
