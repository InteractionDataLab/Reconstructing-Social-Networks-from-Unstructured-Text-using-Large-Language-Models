During this time, I’ve learnt a lot about synthetic biology, iGEM, the efficient way of searching for information I need and the most important thing--teamwork. I really enjoy brainstorming when I participated in 2016 project conceiving process. Because on one hand, we were required to consult numerous articles, on the other hand, it gave us the chance to compose our ideas freely and logically. So what appeals to you to keep passion for iGEM for almost one year?
