                  Pichia pastoris are typical Eukaryotic expression host, but expression of plant genes is still a big challenge. So we firstly tested whether our three interest genes can be efficiently expressed. We measured the secretion of PP2CA, ABF2 and SnRK2.2. We ran a SDS-PAGE of the culture supernatant of induced cells to identify the expression of three recombinant proteins(Fig1). Compared to transformed cells, three kinds of recombinant protein plasmids transformed cells all expressed proteins at 80kD under induction. The shift of protein bands suggest potential glycosylation modification.

                    We constructed expression plasmid and submitted this part <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2036030">BBa_K2036030</A> to the registry. But due to the limited time, its function characterization is still under testing. However, our modeling simulation showed promising switch functions. See to Eukaryote circuit modeling (click here).
