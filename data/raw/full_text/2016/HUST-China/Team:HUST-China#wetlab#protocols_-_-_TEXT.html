PCR Analysis of Pichia Integrants
Analysis by PCR:
1. Set up PCR reactions as follows:
  10X PCR Buffer 5 µl
  Genomic DNA (~1 µg) 5 µl
  100 mM dNTPs (25 mM each) 1 µl
  5´ AOX1 Primer (0.1 µg/µl) 5 µl
   3´ AOX1 Primer (0.1 µg/µl) 5 µl
   Sterile water to 50 µl
   Taq Polymerase (5 U/µl) 0.25 µl
For use, resuspend the lyophilized primer in 20 µl sterile water. The amount of primer may be decreased if desired. For ~20 pmoles primer, use 2 µl of each primer.For amplification controls, use 100 ng of recombinant plasmid (positive control) and 100 ng of the appropriate plasmid without insert (negative control).
2. Layer reactions with 50 µl of mineral oil. If PCR machine is equipped with a nonevaporation unit, mineral oil is not required.

4. Analyze 10 µl on a 1x TAE, 1.0 % agarose gel.
5.If screening Mut+ integrants, two bands will be present. One will correspond to the size of your gene of interest, the other to the AOX1 gene (approximately 2.2 kb). If screening MutS integrants in GS115, only the band that corresponds to the gene of interest will be seen. In KM71, because of the ARG4 insert in AOX1, the PCR product is 3.6 kb. Parent plasmids will produce the following sized PCR products:
Vector
PCR Product
pHIL-D2
188bp
pPIC3.5
214bp
pHIL-S1
262bp
pPIC9(using the 5’AOX1 primer)
492bp
Ppic9(using the α-Factor primer)
195bp
Remember to add these fragments to the size of insert to interpret PCR results.
Expression of Recombinant Pichia Strains
Mut+ Secreted:
Test the effectiveness of your expression conditions by growing GS115 β-Gal which is Mut+ and expresses β-galactosidase intracellularly. Remember to include GS115 or KM71 transformed with the parent vector as a control for background intracellular expression.
1. Using a single colony, inoculate 25 ml of MGY, BMG, or BMGY in a 250 ml baffled flask. Grow at 28-30°C in a shaking incubator (250-300 rpm) until culture reaches an OD600 = 2-6 (~16-18 hours). The cells will be in log-phase growth.
2. Harvest the cells by centrifuging at 1500-3000 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature. Decant supernatant and resuspend cell pellet to an OD600 of 1.0 in MM, BMM, or BMMY medium to induce expression (approximately 100-200 ml).
3. Place culture in a 1 liter baffled flask. Cover the flask with 2 layers of sterile gauze or cheesecloth and return to incubator to continue growth.
4. Add 100% methanol to a final concentration of 0.5% methanol every 24 hours to maintain induction.
5. At each of the times indicated below, transfer 1 ml of the expression culture to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. These samples will be used to analyze expression levels and determine the optimal time post-induction to harvest. Centrifuge at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 2-3 minutes at room temperature.Time points (hours): 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96(or more if you need).
6. For secreted expression, transfer the supernatant to a separate tube. Store the supernatant and the cell pellets at -80°C until ready to assay. Freeze quickly in liquid N2 or a dry ice/alcohol bath.
7. Analyze the supernatants and cell pellets for protein expression by Coomassiestained SDS-PAGE and Western blot or functional assay.

Preparation of supernatant (Secreted Expression):
1. Thaw supernatants and place on ice.
2. Mix 50 µl of the supernatant with 50 µl of SDS-PAGE Gel Loading buffer.
3. Boil 10 minutes, then load 10-30 µl onto the gel. Remaining sample may be stored at -20°C for Western blots, if necessary. Supernatants may be stored at -80°C for further analysis.
SDS-page:
1. Make the separating gel:
Set the casting frames (clamp two glass plates in the casting frames) on the casting stands. Prepare the gel solution in a separate small beaker.Swirl the solution gently but thoroughly. Pipet appropriate amount of separating gel solution into the gap between the glass plates.To make the top of the separating gel be horizontal, fill in water  into the gap until a overflow.Wait for 20-30min to let it gelate.
2.Make the stacking gel:
Discard the water and you can see separating gel left. Pipet in stacking gel untill a overflow. Insert the well-forming comb without trapping air under the teeth. Wait for 20-30min to let it gelate.
3. Make sure a complete gelation of the stacking gel and take out the comb. Take the glass plates out of the casting frame and set them in the cell buffer dam. Pour the running buffer (electrophoresis buffer) into the inner chamber and keep pouring after overflow untill the buffer surface reaches the required level in the outer chamber.
4. Load prepared samples into wells and make sure not to overflow. Don't forget loading protein marker into the first lane. Then cover the top and connect the anodes.
5. Set an appropriate volt and run the electrophoresis when everything's done.
6. As for the total running time, stop SDS-PAGE running when the downmost sign of the protein marker (if no visible sign, inquire the manufacturer) almost reaches the foot line of the glass plate. Generally, about 2.5 hours for a 100V voltage and a 12% separating gel.
7. Stain the gel with Coomassiae billiant blue R250 for 4 hours and destain the gel with water at least 2 hours.
