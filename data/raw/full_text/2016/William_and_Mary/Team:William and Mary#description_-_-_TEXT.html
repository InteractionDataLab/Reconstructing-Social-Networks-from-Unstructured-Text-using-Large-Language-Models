This is the project description page.  It wil serve as the basic section block            for any of our additional imformation pages - those aside from the project overview flowing            presentation page.  The flowing format is automatically created - only the text in the html            needs to be edited.  This block of text here can be used as a basic 'abstract' for this page.            The text-color used in this block is specified inline for ease of access.
Hello, this is the description.  This is just a test to see what this text would look like center-         column.  It looks pretty nice, so I think I'm going to keep it like this for now.  To keep aligned         with the header, I have inserted a left-side padding of 70px.  This was a rough estimate and can be         changed.  Here we can describe our project in more detail than on the front page.  Right now, I'm         just populating the page with text.
