We've made it a long way since the summer began, and we could not have done it without          the numerous people and organizations that supported us.
First and foremost, we would like to thank our two team advisors, Dr. Margaret Saha, PI, and Dr. Gregory Smith,          Co-PI. For her countless hours of time and unbounded dedication to our cause, we extend our sincerest thanks to          Dr. Saha. We would also like to extend a special thanks to Dr. Smith for his expertise in mathematical modeling          and his willingness to advise our math team. In addition, we offer our thanks to the Vice Provost for Research,          Dr. Dennis Manos, who has provided strong support, financial and intellectual, for iGEM and the BioEngineering          Initiative at William and Mary. We also thank Dr. Eric Bradley for his endless assistance with facilities and          equipment. Finally, we thank Dr. Mark Forsyth, Dr. Helen Murphy, Dr. Bev Sher, and Dr. Doug Young for their          advice on the project.

We would also like to thank the following organizations and offices which have generously provided us with the          financial support necessary to carry out our project, in terms of either supplies or summer stipends.
