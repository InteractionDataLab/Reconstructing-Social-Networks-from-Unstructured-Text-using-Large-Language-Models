								</P><P class="large"><B>*</B> Fill out and submit <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:William_and_Mary/Safety">Safety Forms </A> and the <A href="https://igem.org/2016_Judging_Form?id=2066"> Judging Form</A>. - Done
								</P><P class="large"><B>*</B> Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. - <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:William_and_Mary/Attributions"> Done </A></P><P class="large"><B>*</B> Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry. - Done, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2066015"> plLac0-1 Ribozyme Characterization Part – cI-GFP.</A> This part allowed us to characterize the effect of the Ribozyme part on our circuits, showing how we can allow any modifications of circuits to be orthogonal to the rest of the circuit/organism.
								</P><P class="large"><B>Silver</B></P><P class="large"><B>*</B> Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. - <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2066550"> Done</A>, we constructed and characterized an 85xTetO array on the pSB1C3 backbone in order to demonstrate the efficacy of molecular titration, and how others may use this effective and orthogonal tool in their own circuits. 
								</P><P class="large"><B>*</B> Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem. - <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:William_and_Mary/Collaborations"> Done</A>, we collaborated with University of Pittsburgh iGEM and Alverno College iGEM to characterize the entire Anderson RBS library in different cell systems. We also collaborated with Broad Run High School iGEM to build and test our learnsynbio.org initiative, as well as to provide them with advice and guidance on designing their mathematical model and implementing it in MATLAB. 
								</P><P class="large"><B>*</B> iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams' exemplary work) - <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:William_and_Mary/outreach"> Done</A>, we conducted several events over the course of the summer and into the semester as we educated members of the public on the ethical implications and scientific discoveries of synthetic biology. We held a Building With Biology interactive workshop over the summer with elementary school children and their parents to educate them about basic ideas in synthetic biology. We then held a forum on the ethics and implications of gene editing for society with other college students and members of the community. Finally, we created many videos outlining a curriculum in synthetic biology and are housing them on a website we created, www.learnsynbio.org. These videos are intended to introduce high school students to synthetic biology as a field of study, promoting greater literacy and understanding of the field within our society
								</P><B>Gold</B><P class="large"><B>*</B> Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part. This part must NOT be from your 2016 part number range - <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:William_and_Mary/RBS"> Done</A>. We characterized the Community Community of RBS sequences, with help from Pitt iGEM and Alverno iGEM (see collaboration). This characterization allowed us, and will allow future teams, to have better control over their circuitry by knowing exactly how these RBSs perform and can be tuned. 
								</P><P class="large"><B>*</B> Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept. - <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:William_and_Mary/Synthetic_Enhancer"> Done </A>, We were able to successfully characterize the addition of a plateau in our transfer function with the addition of our synthetic enhancer parts, along with the use of RiboJ (a ribozyme) to ensure our device was orthogonal to the cell’s processes.
