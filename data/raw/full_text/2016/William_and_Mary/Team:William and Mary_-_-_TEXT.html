Circuit Control

creating a toolbox allowing for precision circuit control
The Toolbox
Our project aims to provide a modular collection of genetic parts which can specifically and predictably tune the             behavior of an arbitrary genetic circuit. This collection, which we have dubbed the “Circuit Control Toolbox,”             consists of a suite of parts which can be added to the end of a given genetic circuit; each part provides a specific             and independently tunable response which allows direct control over the ultimate output behavior of the circuit.
