							Kalen is a junior studying biology and applied mathematics. The interdisciplinary nature of our project appeals to 
							her desire to blend her interests. Kalen believes the intersection of disciplines is a great source for innovation. 
							She became interested in science and research at a young age.  One of her childhood memories is of constructing a zoo 
							for her dolls to attend, even doing the research to write placards for each animal exhibit. Her continued interest 
							in constructing and designing things has driven her to pursue a career in bioengineering. Eventually she sees herself 
							researching evolutionarily optimized biological structures so that their design can be replicated when engineering 
							biological and non-biological structures. Outside of the lab, Kalen spends her time tutoring elementary students, 
							watching movies, and playing volleyball.

							Ethan is a sophomore pursuing a B.S. in Biology and Computational &amp; Applied Mathematics &amp; Statistics. For as 
							long as he can remember he’s always wanted to be a scientist both because of his love of learning and because 
							of his desire to change the world. Ethan was especially excited to work on iGEM this summer because synthetic 
							biology is a relatively young field and there is a lot that we don't know yet. Additionally, synthetic biology 
							is a field that has a lot of potential to change the future of medicine and the world at large. In his spare 
							time Ethan enjoys perusing local culture forums to consume and create various image and text based communications, 
							as well as learning highly specific useless facts and playing tennis.

							Likhitha is a junior pursuing Biology and Chemistry. She joined the team to work with students who approach 
							a scientific challenge differently from the way she might so that she can develop a well rounded view of the 
							gray area in STEM and think like a mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, biologist, and chemist all 
							at once. Likhitha wants to continue her synthetic biology journey into medical research, which is why the 
							overlap between synthetic biology and biomedicine motivates her to push existing boundaries to build circuits 
							that could for example design microbes that assist cell-based immunotherapy.

							Callan is a sophomore hoping to major in Neuroscience and Computational &amp; Applied Mathematics &amp; Statistics. 
							She’s been in love with all things biology since elementary school, and her recent expedition into the 
							synthetic biology field through iGEM has been incredibly exciting! As a part of the W&amp;M iGEM team Callan 
							has been able to gain valuable research experience while learning how to think about molecular biology in 
							terms of complex systems and circuits. In the future, she has her heart set on working in the medical field 
							in some way, whether it's practicing medicine or participating in biomedical research; she is particularly 
							interested in neurobiology and neurological disorders. In addition to the iGEM team, Callan is also a part 
							of W&amp;M Dhamaal Bhangra, a dance team that specializes in the energetic bhangra dance native to northern India! 
							She also enjoys swimming/diving, tutoring small children, and wandering through the Williamsburg farmers market 
							in search of cute dogs.
