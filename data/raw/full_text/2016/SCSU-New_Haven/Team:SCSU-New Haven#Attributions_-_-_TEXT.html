SCSU iGEM
Attributions
So to whom should the glory and the fame be ascribed to? Who but me? Consider the tireless hours, the blood and the sweat, the agony, the mountain dew, the pepsi cola, and how my tears sprite forth as the ginger ales within me! If not for my endless toiling, what would have been? What is this you say of errors, mistakes and such? Neigh! That is not my portion! Was it not him, she, it and they that were in charge of that? Neigh! All imperfections whether small or large or no fault of mine! They lie solely on the shoulders of others. Neigh to me, attribute only that which is good.
