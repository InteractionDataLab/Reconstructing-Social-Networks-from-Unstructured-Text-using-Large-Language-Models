What if
TB could be Diagnosed in just a few minutes
One Breath = One Result
As synthetic biologists continue to construct increasingly complex gene regulatory networks, the need for accurate quantitative characterization of their regulatory components becomes more pressing. Despite the BioBrick registry's thorough characterization of the average strength of promoters, there is insufficient description of the variability in their expression. Our project aims to characterize this variability, or noise, for the most commonly used promoters in synthetic biology and provide additional tools for the regulation of these promoters.

There are a lot of exciting Parts in the Registry, but many Parts have still not been characterized. Synthetic Biology needs great measurement approaches for characterizing new parts, and efficient new methods for characterizing many parts at once. If you've done something exciting in the area of Measurement, describe it here!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2014 Aachen
2014 Valencia Biocampus
2015 William and Mary
