4 uL of the above "Part" mixture and 4 uL of the 25ng/uL linearized Backbone were mixed producing a DNA concentration of 12.5 ng/uL.
1 uL of the 25 ng/uL Linearized  Backbone was added to the "Control tube" producing a DNA concentration of 2.5 ng/uL.
These were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes, then 80°C for 20 minutes to heat kill, then brought to 4°C until ready to ligate.
Bryan made Digests for each of the parts.

Mixtures were transformed using Transformation JM109 including the SOC outgrowth step and plated on LB+chloro at 37°C.
Monday, 9/19
BP Checked Plates and found no growth. Check transformation protocol, transform with PSB1C3 miniprep DNA next time. Try different plates, there may have been a problem with the Chloro.
May need to test all the chloro plates to find ones that aren't terrible if that is the problem.
SO could be problems : Transformation, plates, design is horribly messed up.
It's not : The enzymes not working, the ligase.

Transformed previous day's ligations using protocol Transformation JM109 with SOC step.
Also transformed 1uL 10pg/uL of J04450 Plasmid from competent cell test kit.
Saturday, 9/24
Figured out why we were having such problems. The liner backbones that are provided have a messed up NotI site due to the way they were PCR produced. So because we have been trying to clone with NotI because of the stuffer sequence problem problems abound. We should break out BBa_J04450 and digest it ourselves with NotI, gel purify it and then try cloning with that.
Broke out BBa_J04450 from the micro wellplate distribution and Transformed it using Transformation JM109
Sunday, 9/25
Streaked out the transformed cells

COLONIESSSSS!!!
Those using the 10-15 Vector made red colonies meaning BBa_J04450 didn't get cut out all the way.
But the Vector Only from 9/30 produced very few colonies (2) and the Feedback and Detector produced 9 and 7 respectively.
Picked the 9 colonies from the Feedback plate and made patches and inoculated each into 5mL liquid LB+Chloro, 250rpm at 37°C.
