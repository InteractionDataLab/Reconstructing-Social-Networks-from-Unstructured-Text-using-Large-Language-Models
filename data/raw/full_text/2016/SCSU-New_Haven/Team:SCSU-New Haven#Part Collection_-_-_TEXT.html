What if
TB could be Diagnosed in just a few minutes
One Breath = One Result
As synthetic biologists continue to construct increasingly complex gene regulatory networks, the need for accurate quantitative characterization of their regulatory components becomes more pressing. Despite the BioBrick registry's thorough characterization of the average strength of promoters, there is insufficient description of the variability in their expression. Our project aims to characterize this variability, or noise, for the most commonly used promoters in synthetic biology and provide additional tools for the regulation of these promoters.

â˜…  ALERT!
This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the Part Collection special prize .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Did your team make a lot of great parts? Is there a theme that ties all your parts together? Do you have more than 10 parts in this collection? Did you make a CRISPR collection, a MoClo collection, or a collection of awesome pigment parts? Describe your parts collection on this page, so the judges can evaluate you for the Best Part Collection award.
While you should put all the characterization information for your parts on the Registry, you are encouraged to explain how all your parts form a collection on this page.
Note
This page should list all the parts in the collection your team made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page.
