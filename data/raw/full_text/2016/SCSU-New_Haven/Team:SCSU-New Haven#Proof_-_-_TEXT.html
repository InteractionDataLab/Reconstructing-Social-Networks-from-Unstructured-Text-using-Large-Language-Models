What if
TB could be Diagnosed in just a few minutes
One Breath = One Result
As synthetic biologists continue to construct increasingly complex gene regulatory networks, the need for accurate quantitative characterization of their regulatory components becomes more pressing. Despite the BioBrick registry's thorough characterization of the average strength of promoters, there is insufficient description of the variability in their expression. Our project aims to characterize this variability, or noise, for the most commonly used promoters in synthetic biology and provide additional tools for the regulation of these promoters.

iGEM teams are great at making things work! We value teams not only doing an incredible job with theoretical models and experiments, but also in taking the first steps to make their project real.
What should we do for our proof of concept?
You can assemble a device from BioBricks and show it works. You could build some equipment if you're competing for the hardware award. You can create a working model of your software for the software award. Please note that this not an exhaustive list of activities you can do to fulfill the gold medal criterion. As always, your aim is to impress the judges!
