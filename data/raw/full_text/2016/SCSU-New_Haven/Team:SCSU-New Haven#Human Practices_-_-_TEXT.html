Building with Biology
Building with Biology strives to bring Synthetic Biology concepts to the classroom. The kits focused on teaching middle and high school students how Synthetic Biology can be used to alter organisms and the ethical considerations when doing so.
We participated in a workshop of local middle and high school teachers. Each member of the team taught groups of teachers how to use a particular kit and how the kit could be used in their classroom.
After the working with the kits we had a ethical discussion about editing the genome. The teachers had a lot of questions about CRISPR/Cas9 how it was used and where it came from.
We also gave a presentation of our iGEM project and told the teachers about iGEM and the parts registry.
