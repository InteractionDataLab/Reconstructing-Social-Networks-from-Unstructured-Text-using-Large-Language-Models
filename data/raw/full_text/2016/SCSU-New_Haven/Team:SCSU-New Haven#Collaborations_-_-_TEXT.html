What if
TB could be Diagnosed in just a few minutes
One Breath = One Result
As synthetic biologists continue to construct increasingly complex gene regulatory networks, the need for accurate quantitative characterization of their regulatory components becomes more pressing. Despite the BioBrick registry's thorough characterization of the average strength of promoters, there is insufficient description of the variability in their expression. Our project aims to characterize this variability, or noise, for the most commonly used promoters in synthetic biology and provide additional tools for the regulation of these promoters.

This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the team collaboration silver medal criterion .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at Instructions for Evaluated Pages .
Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. We encourage you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems that you can more easily solve together.
Which other teams can we work with?
You can work with any other team in the competition, including software, hardware, high school and other tracks. You can also work with non-iGEM research groups, but they do not count towards the iGEM team collaboration silver medal criterion.
In order to meet the silver medal criteria on helping another team, you must complete this page and detail the nature of your collaboration with another iGEM team.
Here are some suggestions for projects you could work on with other teams:
Improve the function of another team's BioBrick Part or Device
Characterize another team's part
Debug a construct
Model or simulating another team's system
Test another team's software
Help build and test another team's hardware project
Mentor a high-school team
