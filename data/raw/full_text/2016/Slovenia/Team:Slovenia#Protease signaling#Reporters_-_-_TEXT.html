Three luciferase based reporters for detection of protease activity were                                             designed and tested.
Cleavable firefly luciferase was used as an inverse reporter, displaying a decrease in luminescence upon proteolytic cleavage.
Circularly permuted and cyclic luciferase were used as direct reporters,                                             displaying an increase in luminescence upon proteolytic cleavage.
Fluorescent and enzymatic reporters with cleavable ER retention signals were                                             designed to test induced protein secretion.

As our project was aimed to develop novel orthogonal signaling pathways based on                                 proteases, as well as at the development of a protein ER retention and release system,                                 we tested and adapted several types of reporters, that will also be useful to other iGEM                                 teams.
To measure the activity of the proteases, we used three types of reporters based on                                 firefly luciferase: the cleavable fLuc inverse reporter, the circularly permutated fLuc                                 (cpLuc)                                 and the cyclic fLuc (cycLuc).
Luciferase reporters for detection of proteolytic activity can be designed to lead either                                 to a decrease of its activity due to proteolysis (inverse reporter) or to increase                                 luciferase activity by proteolytic                                 cleavage of an inactive enzyme. The cleavable luciferase inverse reporter assay is                                 expected to be relatively insensitive as a large fraction of the luciferase, typically                                 more than 20%, has to be degraded before an appreciable difference in the output is                                 detected, while an assay that leads to activation of luciferase might be able to detect                                 much proteolytic activity.

Additionally, we developed a split luciferase system that functions as an output for                                 logic functions, integrating the activity of orthogonal                                 proteases. Finally, to measure protein retention and release from the endoplasmic                                 reticulum (ER), we used TagRFP and SEAP reporters.
nbsp;Results
nbsp;Cleavable luciferase
We inserted amino acid sequences targeted by selected proteases into a loop of the                                     firefly luciferase. The substrate sequence thus divided the fLuc into                                     two fragments (nLuc and cLuc), with a protease cleavage site between them (

A and B). The insertion site for the substrate sequence was based on the                                     previously described split luciferase system
Shekhawat2009
, where we expected that this site would also be permissible to short linker                                     insertion                                     without significantly altering luciferase activity. Upon addition of an appropriate                                     protease, the reporter would be cleaved at the substrate site and the two                                     fragments would dissociate, in turn decreasing the fLuc activity. In this system                                     higher protease activity corresponds to a lower luciferase activity. The reporters                                     were additionally equipped with protein tags at the N- and C-termini in order to                                     allow immunostaining for detection of protein cleavage by western blotting ( Light-dependent                                         mediator Figure 5D ).
nbsp;Circularly permuted                                     luciferase
The first reporter to measure protease activity that results in generation of                                     luciferase activity by proteolytic cleavage was a circularly permuted                                     version of the firefly luciferase (cpLuc). Luciferase is an oxidative enzyme that                                     produces bioluminescence. The protein consists of two compact domains: the larger                                     N- and the smaller C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain is connected to the                                     N-terminal domain by a flexible hinge. When bound to the substrate luciferin,                                     luciferase                                     has to undergo a conformational change from an open to a closed form with the two                                     domains coming together to enclose the substrate and efficiently catalyze its                                     oxidation

Proteolytic activity determined by the cpLuc reporters.
HEK293T cells were transfected with 100 ng of                                                 indicated reporter constructs and 70 ng of their corresponding                                                 proteases.                                                 Luciferase activity was measured 24 h after transfection. The results                                                 are presented as normalized firefly luciferase activity (RLU).
The circularly permutated luciferase makes use of this requirement for a                                     conformational change by rearranging the sequence of the protein. The permutation is                                     obtained                                     by placing the C-terminal region of the protein (amino acids 234-544) upstream of                                     the N-terminal region (amino acids 4-233) and connecting them by a short linker                                     (

C and D), which contains a protease cleavage site
Fan2008
. This linker prevents the conformational change required for efficient                                     catalysis; therefore, the catalytic cycle is triggered only upon cleavage of the                                     linker by a protease.
We designed and tested four new cpLuc reporters. Activity of all four reporters                                     depended on cleavage by the corresponding protease as expected (

), however light emission from this reporter system was                                     relatively low, compelling us to look for a more efficient reporter.
nbsp;Cyclic luciferase
The cyclic luciferase system takes the mechanism of cpLuc one step further by fusing                                     two fragments of an intein to the ends of the cpLuc. Inteins are protein                                     fragments that allow protein splicing and cyclization by formation of a new peptide                                     bond between the N- and C-termini of the protein, which generates an inactive                                     protein that can be activated by the proteolytic cleavage. We expected this reporter                                     to result in a higher signal from the cpLuc due to the stabilization of the                                     protein by cyclization (

E). To further optimize the dynamic range of the system, a PEST sequence for fast                                     digestion of the protein was included at                                     the C-terminus of the protein. This sequence targets any of the unspliced protein to                                     degradation, while the spliced cyclic protein remains stable, since the PEST                                     sequence is excised along with the intein fragments during the splicing reaction

nbsp;TagRFP
For detection of the localization of our ER targeted reporters inside cells we used the fluorescent protein TagRFP (Evrogen), which was fused to the                                     appropriate localization and proteolytic target tags and used confocal microscopy                                     for detection.

, modified the                                     wild type RFP from the sea anemone Entacmaea quadricolor to prolong its                                     fluorescence lifetime and make it less susceptible to pH. With addition of the AU1                                     tag,                                     we were also able to detect its expression and secretion with western blot ( Protease                                         inducible secretion Figure 3 ).
nbsp;SEAP
For a protein secretion assay with increased sensitivity we replaced the TagRFP with                                     the human secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter, which can                                     readily and accurately be quantified within the medium of transfected cells
Berger1988
. SEAP released into the medium was detected with the                                     Quanti-blue colorimetric enzyme assay (Invivogen) ( Protease                                         inducible secretion Figure 4 ).
