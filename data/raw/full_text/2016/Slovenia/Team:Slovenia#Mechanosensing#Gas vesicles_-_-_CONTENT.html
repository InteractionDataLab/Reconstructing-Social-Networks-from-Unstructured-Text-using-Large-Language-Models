One idea that initially looked too crazy to work was to use genetically encoded gas vesicles
                                    that are produced in bacteria. Bacterial gas vesicles have been used as contrasting agents for ultrasonography in animals <X-REF>Shapiro2014</X-REF>. This demonstrated
                                    that ultrasound can have effect on gas vesicles. However adding bacterial gas vesicles instead of microbubbles would not solve the problem. The best solution would be
                                    if the gas vesicles could be produced in the functional form in mammalian cells. Several iGEM teams have previously used gas vesicles expressed in bacteria,

                                    Glasgow2014</A>) where typically a large gene cluster had to be expressed to obtain gas vesicles.
 However iGEM team <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:OUC-China">OUC-China 2012</A> demonstrated
                                    that only two protein components were sufficient to prepare functional gas vesicles in <I>E.coli</I>. Since gas vesicles are compressible their size should vary with
                                    pressure variations in the ultrasound or by mechanical stimulus, which would strongly influence the cytoskeleton or cell membrane. Therefore, they would likely amplify

                                                Gas vesicles are stable gas-filled structures, typically forming cylinders measuring between 45-200 nm in width and up to
												1000 nm in length, which provide buoyancy in a wide variety of planktonic prokaryotes <X-REF>Buchholz1993</X-REF>. Two 
												structural proteins have been identified in the gas vesicles of cyanobacteria and the halophilic archaea. The major and most 
												conserved structural protein of gas vesicles GvpA, is small highly hydrophobic protein that forms the ribs of the gas vesicle wall,
												while the minor gas vesicle protein, GvpC, is larger, hydrophilic protein that stabilizes the structure <X-REF>Hayes1986</X-REF>.
												In the self-assembled vesicles, the connection between protein units is so tight to prevent penetration of water yet allows diffusion 
												of most gases, which therefore fill the vesicle cavity. Gases inside vesicles correspond to the gas composition of the environment and 
												can be compressed by a sudden increase of the pressure unlike the liquid-filled cytosol and other cellular vesicles.
