                            . Our project
                            relies on the reconstitution of split protein promoted by coiled coil (CC) dimerization. The
                            interaction between CC peptides can be finely tuned
                            <X-REF>Woolfson2005, Gradisar2011, Negron2014</X-REF>
                            , thereby CCs offers a flexible and
                            versatile platform in terms of designing logic operation <I>in vivo</I>. With the purpose of
                            understanding the relation that underlies the interaction between coiled coil peptides and
                            therefore using them in logic gates, we designed the following model (<REF>5.4.1.</REF>). Our system is based on constructs that have been characterized in mammalian cells in the
                            context of <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Slovenia/Protease_signaling/Logic">logic

                                design</A>. Two orthogonal CC segments, <B>A</B> and <B>b</B>, fused together in one chain can bind each
                            other and form a stable CC pair. This complex exists in equilibrium with the peptide <B>B</B>,
                            which
                            can also bind the peptide <B>A</B> and has a different affinity from the peptide <B>b</B>. The linker that
                            connects <B>A</B> and <B>b</B> can be cleaved by a generic protease (e.g. TEVp). This irreversible reaction
                            shifts the equilibrium towards a state in which all three peptides are free in
                            solution
                            and therefore compete for binding. In our experiments, a similar system as the generic coils
                           <B>A</B>
                            and <B>B</B> was fused to the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Slovenia/Protease_signaling/Reporters#cle">split

                            (obtained by substituting <I>a</I> and <I>d</I> positions with Ala) leads to a small difference of the

                            before and after cleavage. Using a slightly destabilized coiled coil (P3mS-2A), which

                            only 2 alanines in the second heptad, the signal after cleavage reached its maximum of 16
