Touchpaint - detecting touch by light. The iGEM symbol was drawn with a glass rod letter by letter on engineered human cells and imaged by a camera.          Cells were transfected with constructs coding for the bacterial ion channel MscS, gas vesicles (GvpA and GvpC) to enhance mechanosensing and a Ca-dependent                             cyclic split luciferase reporter to visualize the signal by light.
  Sonicell
Project Sonicell introduces exciting foundational advances to synthetic biology aimed to                                 enable rapid cellular response to a combination of external stimuli such as sound, light                                 or chemical compounds. This system is composed of a module for enhanced sensitivity of                                 cells to ultrasound or other mechanical stimuli, sensed by a calcium-dependent reporter,                                 and a module for integration of a combination of several input signals into a signaling                                 pathway based on proteolysis by a collection of orthogonal proteases. Finally, the proteases were                                 designed to cleave an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal from target proteins, which                                 results in secretion of premade proteins.
Enhanced mechanosensing:
Sensitivity of mammalian cells to ultrasound or other mechanical stimuli was enhanced by the introduction                                             of mechanosensitive ion channels and/or by the expression of protein gas vesicles from bacteria. Influx of                                             calcium through channels is sensed by formation of a complex between calmodulin and M13 peptide that can                                             result in a rapid light emission by cells (used for cell painting) or reconstitution of a split protease.
Protease based signaling
and information processing:
Combinations of proteolytic activities against specific targets resulted in activation of a reporter or another                                             protease, which forms the basis for the design of a new type of rapid signaling pathways and construction of                                             logic functions.
Orthogonal site-specific proteases:
A collection of orthogonal                                             site-specific proteases that recognize different targets was prepared as split proteins, whose activity against                                             selected targets can be induced by stimulation with an external signal such as light or chemicals.
Protease-triggered rapid secretion
of therapeutic proteins:
A rapid cellular                                             response by secretion of a protein is triggered by the proteolytic cleavage of an endoplasmic reticulum retention                                             peptide. After the cleavage the cargo protein is moved from the ER, and secreted as therapeutic protein.
 Abstract for experts
Synthetic biology opens exciting perspectives to control cells, for applications ranging from                             industrial processes to cell-based therapy. However, the large majority of designed cellular                             circuits are based on transcriptional regulation, which may be too slow for many                             therapeutic or diagnostic applications, for example delivery of insulin or detection of a                             metabolite. Several medical doctors and researchers that we consulted stressed that a fast                             but controllable response is high on their wish list of expectations from synthetic biology.                             Additionally, noninvasive stimulation of selected tissues in the organism would also be highly desirable. While light is extremely useful as a rapid, spatially-restricted input                             signal, it cannot penetrate deep into the tissue. On the other hand, ultrasound combines                             several advantages of light with the added ability to penetrate tissue.
In our project we enhanced the sensitivity of mammalian cells to ultrasound or other                             mechanical stimuli by introduction of bacterial or engineered mammalian mechanosensors.                             Additionally, the response to ultrasound and touch was strongly increased by expression of                             the two components of bacterial gas vesicles, GvpA and GvpC. Mechanosensing was detected by                             the calcium-induced calmodulin-M13 complex reconstituting split cyclic luciferase, highly                             applicable for the emerging field of mechanogenetics. This enabled us to draw on cells using                             touch, where we engaged in collaboration with the artist Laura Olalde.
For the rapid response of cells to multiple stimuli we designed proteolysis-based signaling                             pathways. Four orthogonal split proteases were generated, each recognizing                             its own motif of seven amino acid residues. Based on cleavage of coiled-coil dimerizing                             domains we demonstrated the ability to implement proteolysis-based signal pathways and logic                             functions in mammalian cells. Based on the cleavage of an ER retention peptide by a                             protease, input signals led to protein secretion without the slow step of induced protein                             synthesis.
We believe that this project introduced several foundational advances that could be very                             useful to synthetic biology far beyond iGEM and for the benefit of humanity for therapy,                             diagnostics and potentially many other advanced applications.
 Abstract in plain English
Synthetic biology aims to control cells so they can obey our commands and do what we want,                             for example produce drugs when needed. In our project we made cells which respond to ultrasound                             or touch. When we touch the cells they light up, which can be recorded on a camera. Ideally                             we want cells to respond to our commands as fast as possible, because sometimes we can’t                             wait an hour before the cells produce the medicine and release it. That is why we gave cells                             a novel mechanism of processing information.                             We achieved this by combining several enzymes that recognize very specific parts of proteins                             and cut them, which changes their function. This allowed us to combine different signals,                             like sound, touch, light or chemicals, to obtain the desired cell response. The new enzymes                             can also cut the anchor with which medicines are attached to cells after the cells make                             them. Among many possible uses of our inventions, we can imagine activating cells in the                             brain by ultrasound, which means that we don’t need to use                             surgery to help people with Parkinson’s disease, or can trigger fast production of insulin                             in the body, to help people with diabetes.

 Part improvements
We improved the BioBricks BBa_K737005 and BBa_K737017 , deposited by team OUC-China in 2012, coding for the        GvpC protein. This protein is one of two proteins that compose protein gas vesicles, which were used in our project to enhance the sensitivity of mammalian        cells to mechanical stimuli. We improved the part by adding a FLAG tag, which allowed us to analyze the expression of the part form the cells via western blot and       to observe the subcellular localization of the protein by confocal microscopy. We further characterized the part by expressing it in mammalian cells together with        GvpA, showing that these proteins substantially increase the cell sensitivity to ultrasound. This part also plays a central role in our Mechanosensing collection.
We also improved BBa_K157010 , a transmembrane domain used by 2008 iGEM Freiburg team. We used this domain as        an anchor to which we attached the TagRFP protein on the N-terminal side and the ER retention signal on the C-terminal side. By western blots and confocal fluorescent       microcopy we were able to show that this part can not only be used for plasma membrane localization but can also be retained in the ER with the simple addition of a       4-amino-acid retention signal KKMP. Upon induced proteolytic cleavage of the retention signal by inducible split protease, the protein was translocated to the trans        GA and the plasma membrane, where TagRFP was cleaved by furin and secreted into the medium.
