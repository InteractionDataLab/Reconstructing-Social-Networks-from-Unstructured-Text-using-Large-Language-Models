 Inovation in measurement
A new, simple and reliable approach for real time measurement of the intracellular calcium concentration was developed.
Our project required a sensitive and fast method for detecting cytosolic calcium concentrations.            This measurement is a fast-relay system, has low response at the physiological cytosolic level of calcium and works in vivo in mammalian cells.
Sensor development and characterization
While calcium influx could be detected by exogenous fluorescent dyes such as Fura Red and Fluo-4, our project required a sensitive, genetically             encoded calcium sensor that would couple a change in the calcium concentration to a biologically relevant output, such as the luciferase reporter or            reconstitution of a split protease for the initiation of the signaling pathway. An ideal calcium sensor should be inactive at intracellular concentration             of calcium and have a high response to calcium concentrations above physiological levels and should be detected by a quick and easy readout. For our            intended application, the calcium sensor should also have the potential to act as the reconstitution mechanism for split proteins so that a conformational             rearrangement in the presence of calcium would bring the two split protein fragments together and reconstitute the protein’s activity.
A wide palette of genetically encoded calcium sensors have been used for mapping intracellular calcium concentration

. These reporters are based on different mechanisms of detection. From this abundant             collection we selected calmodulin (CaM)-based calcium sensors (in particular CaMeleons), since their mechanism is based on a large conformational change,             allowing reconstitution of split proteins

We replaced the FRET pair of CaMeleon2.12 by a split firefly luciferase (fLuc) as it provides a distinct signal even at small amounts and has a high             signal-to-noise ratio. The new luciferase based calcium sensor was named fLuc2.12. The fLuc2.12 was tested on HEK293 cells, but we found that the sensor            was active already in resting cells (
1
). We hypothesized the activation was a consequence of a close proximity of calmodulin and M13 in the             fusion even in the absence of calcium binding. In order to resolve this problem we set out to test a similar sensor based on two separate molecules.             Two-molecule-based CaM sensors have not been widely used, but lower leakage in comparison to a single molecule sensor has been reported by Miyawaki et al.

A luminescence calcium sensor based on the calmodulin-M13 fusion fLuc2.12 has high activity already at the resting levels of calcium.
HEK293T cells were transfected with 50 ng fLuc2.12. 24 h after transfection luciferase activities were measured immediately after              addition of calcium ionophore A23187 (10 µM). Scheme: The chimeric protein M13-calmodulin fused to N- and C- fragments of split luciferase changes               conformation upon calcium binding.
Based on the inspection of the 3D structure of the CaM-M13 complex ( PDB code: 2BBM ), we           fused the N-terminal fragment of the split firefly luciferase to the N-terminus of M13 (nLuc:M13, BBa_K1965016 )          and the C-terminal fragment of the split firefly luciferase to the C-terminus of calmodulin           (CaM:cLuc, BBa_K1965015 ). The split calcium sensor is represented in

A. When transfected into          HEK293T cells the sensor was expressed in the cytosol (

The split luciferase reporter was tested on live cells (

) but the ratio of the outputs from stimulated and non-stimulated                 cells remained                  low, because activation of the sensor was still detectable at the cytoplasmic concentration of calcium. In order to decrease the                  activation of the sensor                 at the resting levels of calcium we introduced two mutations E31Q, E104Q in the EF hand motifs, reported previously to decrease                  the affinity of CaM to calcium
Evans2009
. We prepared the single mutant E104Q and the double mutant E31Q, E104Q                  split calcium sensors and tested both reporters on HEK293T cells (

).
Split calcium sensor is expressed in the cytosol.
(A) Scheme of the function of the split calcium sensor. Calmodulin is fused to the C-terminal fragment and M13             is fused to N-terminal fragment of split firefly luciferase. Free calcium ions trigger binding of M13 to calmodulin and formation of active             luciferase. (B) Split calcium sensor is expressed in the cytosol. HEK293T cells were transfected with 50 ng of nLuc:M13 and 10 ng of CaM:cLuc.             24 h after transfection cells were fixed, stained with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies and localization was confirmed on the confocal             microscope.
Split calcium sensing reporter with a single mutation E104Q within calmodulin demonstrated the highest signal-to-noise             ratio for the calcium influx.
(A) Schemes of split calcium sensors corresponding to the graphs below. (B) Mutations within calmodulin of             the split calcium sensing systems changed the response to calcium. HEK293T cells were transfected with split calcium sensors (50 ng). 24 h            after transfection, luciferase activities were measured immediately after addition of calcium ionophore A23187 (10 µM ).
Split calcium reporter with a single mutation (E104Q) introduced into calmodulin worked best, whereas the sensor with two mutations (E31Q, E104Q)           generated a low signal. The sensor with E104Q mutation had the highest ratio of the stimulated vs. resting cells, therefore representing the best calcium           sensor. We additionally tested whether the ratio between the components of the calcium sensor affects the fold change between the signal of non-stimulated           and stimulated cells (
4
). The response of the reported depended on the ratio, favoring an excess of the nLuc:M13, with the highest ratio close to 10.
This reporter (CaM(E104Q):cLuc + nLuc:M13) was later used to detect response of cells to activation of mechanoreceptors, where it enabled clear difference          between stimulated and unstimulated cells, already few minutes after the stimulation and could be used for real time monitoring of mechanosensing.
Dependence of the response of split calcium sensor on the ratio of both protein components.
Fold activation of split calcium           sensor depended on ratio between the CaM:cLuc and nLuc:M13. HEK293T cells were transfected with split calcium sensor CaM:cLuc and nLuc:M13. 24 h after           transfection luciferase activities were measured immediately after the addition of  ionophore A23187 (10 µM).
The split calcium sensor is compatible with different constructs such as designed mechano-responsive receptors channels and different means of stimulation. In addition to ionophore stimulation, it also responds to stimulation by ultrasound and direct contact that underlies the sense of touch .
Potential use of calcium sensor as a measurement device was tested. In addition to the split calcium sensor,          HEK293 cells were transfected with MscS ( BBa_K1965000 ), (
2
A) and were          stimulated by ultrasound. Increase of intracellular level of Ca2+ caused reconstitution of split luciferase. Consequently,          we were able to observe increase in luminiscence in less than one minute in the cells expressing MscS and split calcium sensor (
5
).
Split calcium sensor responds to utrasound stimulation
HEK293 cells were transfected with           MscS mechanosensitive channels and split calcium sensor (CaM(E104Q):cLuc and nLuc:M13) 24 h prior to stimulation. 30 minutes before the ultrasound            stimulation we added media with 1 mM luciferin and 4 mM CaCl2 2+ and response was measured via bioluminescence imaging.
As shown in (
6
, cells were able to convert the mechanical stimulus (in this case, touching with a glass rod: touchpaint )into light signal by activation of the calcium sensor and reconstitution of the split luciferase.
Synthetic mechano-responsive calcium sensing system enables visualization of calcium influx after mechanical stimulation.

Upon mechanical stimulation, calcium enters the cell via MscS channels, enabling activation of the           calcium sensor and reconstitution of the split luciferase, (B) Images of petri dishes seeded with HEK293 cells, expressing the mechano-responsive calcium           sensing system after mechanical stimulation .24 h after transfection, luciferin and CaCl2 were added to the media and the cells were stimulated           by gentle drawing with a glass rod. Afterwards, camera images were taken in darkness with exposure time 30 s.
