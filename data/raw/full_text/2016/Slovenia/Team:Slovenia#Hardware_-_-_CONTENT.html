                                setup consisting of two signal generators (one for switching on and off the train of US
                                pulses and the other one to produce the sinusoidal signal of suitable frequency). This
                                signal is further fed to the amplifier and then to the ultrasonic transducer.
                                Furthermore, an ultrasonic sensor is required to evaluate and control the magnitude of
                                the ultrasound. Usually a hydrophone is used in combination with an amplifier and an
                                oscilloscope. This setup is complex to establish and difficult to use. Therefore, the
                                goal of a part of the iGEM 2016 group (student of electrical engineering) was to develop
                                a device (named Moduson), which would be capable of providing appropriate signals

                                easy to use. The research and development of the device was performed in the Laboratory
                                for Bioelectromagnetics at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of
                                Ljubljana under

                                under the microscope, cells in a petri dish, cells in a microplate immersed into a bath
                                and to stimulate animals. In order to fulfill this requirement we selected a dedicated
                                embedded measurement card Red Pitaya acting as an embedded computer. This embedded
                                device is based on Linux system and can be completely customized to the user’s needs.
                                Furthermore, it can be Wi-Fi controlled so the final application is based on modern
                                programming tools such as JavaScript, C++, HTML, etc. The final application is essentially
                                a web page, accessible with any computer with a Wi-Fi connection. This

                                (amplitude of 2 V) to several hundred volts or even above 1000 V, which poses a serious
                                engineering challenge. For this purpose, we first designed a circuitry on a conceptual
                                level and simulated it with LT Spice (<REF>4</REF>). In the simulations an electric model of a transducer was considered as a combination
                                of capacitors, inductors and resistors wired in parallel (<REF>5</REF>). This model enables simulation of ultrasonic transducers with several resonant
                                frequencies. Simulations show that our device can reach the power at transducer around
                                92W, which is close to the measured 86W in the real system.
