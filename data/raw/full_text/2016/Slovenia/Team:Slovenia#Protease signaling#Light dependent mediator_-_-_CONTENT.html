HEK293T cells were transfected with 1:3 ratio of plasmids coding for CRY2PHR:CIBN with split TEV (B) or PPV (C) protease. 24 hours after transfection, cells were illuminated with blue light at 460nm for indicated periods of time. The cells were lysed and bioluminescence was measured with dual luciferase assay. Upon illumination with blue light, the protease cleaves only the cyclic reporter with the correct cleavage site (red bars), while the cyclic reporter with the mismatched cleavage site remains uncleaved (white bars).
