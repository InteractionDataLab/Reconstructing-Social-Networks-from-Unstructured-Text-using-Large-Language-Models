						finding the final destination.</P><P>No matter how different or fascinating the boat is, its main purpose is to safely arrive to the harbor. Before there were modern GPS systems, sailors
						had to rely on using natural events and signs. One of the main was the lodestar, the most shining star, which is always a good orientation point.</P><P>Similarly, many research projects can struggle no matter how fascinating they are. They might lose the feeling of reality and just travel for the sake of travel.</P><P>In order to give the right coordinates, which showed to be of high importance in our case, we developed a new symbol for future iGEM teams who might apply their 
						projects to the medical field – community oriented lodestar. No matter if the team is competing in the foundational advance or medical application section, maximization
						of the benefit to society should be the number one priority.</P><DIV style="display:block; width: 100%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" align="center"><DIV class="ui segment"><DIV id="tekst" data="empty"><H3 id="THEstar">For content click on THE star</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV><P style="clear:both;">Consequently, if ever lost, teams should just find the shining star and orient in respect to it. By thorough discussions and careful implementation of ideas
						provided by all the participants involved in the dialogue, iGEM team should be able to present at the Giant Jamboree the most of the project –completely analyzed project 
						in real life. It’s not only the idea that influences the minds and thinking of individuals involved, the relationship is reciprocal. People involved have a great
						deal of influence over the idea itself as well. The concept will be explained on our example. While competing in the foundational advance track we have considered
						many possible medical applications of our project, particularly diabetes, Parkinson’s disease and hemorrhagic diseases, since medicine is the field of study of several
						students and other students and mentors have a soft spot for this direction. .</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
