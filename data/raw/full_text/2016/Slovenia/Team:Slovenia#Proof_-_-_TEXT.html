 Touch painting
Human cells with increased ultrasound sensitivity were shown to respond to other            types of mechanical stimulation, such as shear stress and touch.
Touch responsive cells were used as a canvas in our sci-art touch painting            implementation.
 
While ultrasound was used to stimulate mechanosensors in our project, since it is most                                 appropriate for the stimulation of deep tissue, other mechanical stimuli                                 could also trigger activation of mechanosensors. Mechanical stimulation appears to be a                                 critical modulator for many aspects of biology, both of living tissue and                                 cells

. In recent years, many methods of activation of                                 mechanosensitive channels have been implemented. Among the activators of mechanosensors,                                 hyperosmolarity has been shown to trigger the activation of certain genes

Therefore our system might be also activated by other mechanical stimuli. One of them was                                 stimulation by direct contact that underlies the sense of touch. Our designed                                 mechano-responsive system is composed of two modules. Firstly we included modules to                                 provide and increase the sensitivity to mechanical stress by mechanoresponsive                                     ion channels and gas                                     vesicles . Secondly, the influx of calcium is visualized by the dimerization                                     of calmodulin (attached to the C terminus of split luciferase) and M13                                 (attached to the N terminus of split luciferase) which results in bioluminescence after                                 the reconstitution of split luciferase. This means that this system is able to                                 convert the mechanical stimulus into light signal, or to put it differently, with our                                 system we are able to see when cells are touched.
Shear flow also exerts mechanical force on cells, which also has relevance for the                                 endothelial cells within blood vessels, therefore also the flow of the liquid                                 medium around cells might be sensed by cells. The experiment to test this ability was                                 performed by agitating the petri dish with attached cells. In order to identify                                 if the engineered cells are able to respond to the shear flow we included control cells                                 that either constitutively express the luciferase and cells that harbour only                                 the calcium-dependent reporter without constructs to increase the mechanosensing along                                 with cells expressing the gas vesicles and reporters.
Mechanical stimulation of cells by manual agitation
Firefly luciferase activity before and                                             immediately after manual agitation is shown. 24 hours after                                             the transfection, luciferin and calcium were added to the cell medium. The                                             cells were shaken a few times and the response was measured via                                             bioluminescence imaging.
Results show that the light was emitted only in cells with the constitutive luciferase if                                 the plate has not been moved (

). On the other hand shaking                                 triggered activation of the luciferase, with significantly higher level in cells that                                 harboured gas vesicles in addition to the reporter, demonstrating that activation                                 does not require high pressure on cells.
Next we wondered if cells could respond to a gentle touch. We were excited to see that                                 already in the first experiment we could clearly see where cells have been                                 touched by a glass rod. The best paintbush to stimulate cells without removing them from                                 the plate has yet to be identified but we found that glass rod functions quite                                 well. We realized that we could use touch to illuminate cells, effectively painting or                                 drawing on cells by recording the trace with emitted light, which we called                                 Touchpaint. At that time the Argentinian visual artist Laura Olalde, PhD,                                 interested in arts and science symbiosis, and interested in connections between art and                                 science                                 visited our lab. She was immediately eager to test Touchpaint as the new artistic                                 medium, which enables us to transfer the sense of touch into light.
The immediate results were visible from drawing of symbols of our project on cells that                                 were immediately (within 5 min) visualized by imager.

Split calcium sensing system                                             based on split firefly luciferase linked to M13 and calmodulin is shown.                                             (B) Images of petri dishes seeded with HEK293 cells transfected with                                             mechanosensing enhancers and luciferase reporters after stimulation of cells                                             with                                             glass rod. HEK293 cells were transfected with split calcium sensors. 24 h                                             after transfection cells were stimulated by touching with a glass rod.                                             Afterwards, camera images were taken in darkness with exposure time 30 s.
Emitted light was recorded with an imager by capturing light for 30 sec. We                                 observed that the drawn lines were fading with time, which suggested that the response is quite fast. Therefore, we sequentially recorded separately drawn letters to obtain presented images (

Laura prepared several stamps and we experimented with different methods of cell                                 immobilization on the plate, however due to the time constraints of the                                 iGEM project we have yet to explore the intricacies of Touchpaint techniques. Response                                 of the system is quite fast as the sequential drawing of letters of the                                 iGEM acronym already started to fade by drawing the text letter few minutes after the                                 first one, therefore real time monitoring of cell drawing is a very realistic                                 proposition. While Touchpaint is just one artistic implementation of the technology,                                 there are many other scientific and applied uses of this technology,                                 which are discussed in the Impact section .
