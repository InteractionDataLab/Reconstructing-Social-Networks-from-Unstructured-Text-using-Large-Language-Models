 Protease                                 orthogonality
Two TEVp variants (TEVpE and TEVpH) were tested and proved to be mutually                                             orthogonal.
Upon overexpression none of the tested proteases were toxic to mammalian                                             cells, demonstrating that they do not interfere with essential cellular                                             processes.
Additionally, three TEVp homologues (PPVp, SbMVp and SuMMVp) were tested and                                             proved to be fully orthogonal.
 
The first challenge in construction of a new protease-based signaling cascade was the                                 selection of appropriate proteases. The candidate proteases should:                                 i) recognize defined target cleavage sequences, preferably as long as possible; ii) be                                 active in mammalian cells, but not toxic to them and iii) be inducible,                                 ideally through the reconstitution of split protein fragments. Most importantly, a large                                 number of proteases with similar properties but different                                 substrates should be available to allow for modular construction of signaling pathways                                 and logic functions. These proteases should be orthogonal to each                                 other, meaning that their specific cleavage sites should not be recognized by other                                 proteases in the system.
We found that the tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) was the only protease described in                                 the literature to match our criteria.

TEV protease is a highly specific, 242 amino acids long, 27 kDa cysteine                                         protease, that originates from the tobacco etch virus (TEV) of the Potyvirus                                         genus.                                         It has a target recognition sequence of seven amino acids, ENLYFQ-S/G, where                                         cleavage occurs after the glutamine residue (denoted by the – symbol),                                         and the final residue of the recognition sequence can be either S or G (denoted                                         by the / symbol). This substrate sequence is scarcely represented in the                                         proteome. TEV protease is therefore relatively non-toxic
Parks1994
and can be safely expressed in host cells. Due to this non-toxicity and                                         its high cleavage specificity, TEVp is an attractive protease for use in several                                         biotechnological applications, such as removal of affinity tags                                         from recombinant proteins.
Despite its widespread use in biotechnology, TEVp also displays some                                         shortcomings, the most prominent of them being self-cleavage. Substitution                                         of Ser-219 with Val or Pro
Cesaratto2015
or a replacement of the C-terminal sequence MSELVYSQ with the sequence MNEGGGLE
Cesaratto2015
decreased the self-cleavage of TEVp and thereby increased its activity.
To overcome the lack of inducible orthogonal proteases, we looked for the characterized                                 TEVp mutants and naturally occurring proteases, closely related to                                 TEVp that might also be used to function as split proteases.

, our team decided to test two mutated variants of TEVp - TEVpE and TEVpH.

tackled the problem of acquiring novel orthogonal proteases by screening a                                             library of TEVp mutants for orthogonal                                             specificity. They designed a novel yeast ER sequestration screening assay                                             that allowed them to identify variants of TEVp that recognize                                             alternative substrates. The two most prominent mutants were TEVpE, which                                             cleaves the substrate ENLYFE-S (TEVsE) and TEVpH, cleaving the substrate                                             ENLYFH-S (TEVsH). Although the two variants were also able to cleave the                                             wild type TEVp substrate                                             ENLYFQ-S (TEVs), they displayed a high preference for their own variation of the substrate and were mutually orthogonal.
To test these two proteases we used a cleavable                                     firefly luciferase                                     (fLuc) reporter with an appropriate cleavage sequence inserted in a permissible                                     site. We observed a significant decrease in luciferase activity upon                                     co-expression of the reporters and their corresponding proteases, whereas                                     co-expression of an orthogonal protease did not decrease the luciferase activity (
1
). These results were additionally confirmed by results from western blotting, where                                     cleavage of the luciferase reporter was                                     detected only in the presence of the corresponding protease, but not in the presence                                     of orthogonal proteases (

Activity and orthogonality of TEVp variants.
(A) Activity of cleavable fLuc with the wild type TEVs cleavage sequence is reduced only in the presence of wild type TEVp. (B) Activity of cleavable fLuc with the TEVsE cleavage sequence is reduced only in the presence of TEVpE. (C) Activity of cleavable fLuc with the  TEVsH cleavage sequence is reduced only in the presence of TEVpH. HEK293T cells were transfected with the                                                 indicated fLuc:TEVs and TEVp variant constructs. Luciferase activity was                                                 determined 24 h after transfection. (D) Table of cleavage sequences for the wild type TEVp and its variants. The cleavage occurs before the final Ser and is indicated by -.
No data has previously been reported on TEVpE and TEVpH toxicity,                                     therefore we expressed each TEVp variant in                                     HEK293T cells and performed a viability assay. Even after transfection with a high                                     amount of the plasmid for each respective protease, the cells showed high viability,                                     with practically                                     no difference when compared to cells transfected with a mock plasmid (

).
Orthogonality and activity of TEVpE and TEVpH.
HEK293T cells were transfected with 2000 ng of                                                 the indicated protease and 500 ng of the indicated reporter. Cells                                                 were lysed and analyzed by western blotting with anti-AU1 antibodies. The cleaved reporter (55 kDa) was detected only in the presence of the                                                 corresponding                                                 TEVp variant.
Different TEVp variants are not toxic to HEK293T cells.
HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids                                                 coding for different TEVp variants. 48 hours after transfection, cells                                                 were stained with the trypan blue dye, which stains only dead cells. The                                                 ratio of live and dead cells was analysed with the Countess automated                                                 cell counter.
 TEVp homologs
Introduction of two new TEVp variants expanded our repertoire of tools, demonstrating                                     that we can use the results of mutational screenings for                                     protease variants. However, a larger number of strictly orthogonal proteases would                                     be required for modular design of complex logic circuits. We therefore decided to                                     investigate the activity of de novo created split proteases from the potyviridae                                     family.

The NIa proteases from the potyviridae group of plant viruses in general                                             recognize a seven amino acid sequence motif as their substrate. They are                                             are classified as cysteine proteases with an active site closely related to                                             eukaryotic serine proteases. The NIa proteases adopt a characteristic                                             two-domain antiparallel β-barrel fold. The active site of the protease                                             comprises a catalytic triad: His-46, Asp-81, Cys-151 (amino acids numbered                                             according to the TEVp sequence) with a Gly-x-Cys-Gly motif around the active                                             cysteine residue

We searched for different potyviruses available on UniProt (

), paying particular                                     attention to any evidence of orthogonality among their target substrates.                                     We decided to test the plum pox virus protease (PPVp), the soybean mosaic virus                                     protease (SbMVp), and the sunflower mild mosaic virus protease (SuMMVp).

PPVp is one of the most studied potyviral proteases after the TEV protease.                                             Its substrate (PPVs) has an amino acid sequence NVVVHQ-A.                                             In contrast to TEVp, it has been reported that PPVp is resistant to                                             self-cleavage at the C-terminus

SbMVp has been                                             recently studied by Seo et al. as a tool for protein-protein interaction                                             studies in the soybean plant. The substrate (SbMVs) has been determined to                                             be the                                             sequence ESVSLQ-S

All selected potyviral proteases were designed as synthetic genes and their activity                                     was tested in mammalian cells using cyclic luciferase reporters , which propagate luciferase activity only upon                                     cleavage.                                     We detected an increase of luciferase activity only in the corresponding                                     protease-reporter pairs, confirming exquisite orthogonality of the selected                                     proteases and                                     their activity in the human cell chassis (
