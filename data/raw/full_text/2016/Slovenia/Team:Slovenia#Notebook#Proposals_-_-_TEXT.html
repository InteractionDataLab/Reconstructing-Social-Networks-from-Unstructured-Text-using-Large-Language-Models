The idea for Slovenia's iGEM2016 project formed through several weeks of modifying and polishing rough initial suggestions. Each student selected for the team contributed their own proposal of the project and therefore contributed to the final idea that resulted in the rest of this wiki page. However, if you are interested in the dawn of our project, please find the initial proposals of the students below.
