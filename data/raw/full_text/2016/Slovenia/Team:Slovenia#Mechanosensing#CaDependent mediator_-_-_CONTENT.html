                                    signal-to-noise ratio. The new luciferase based calcium sensor was named fLuc2.12. The fLuc2.12 construct was tested on HEK293T cells, but we found that the sensor was active
                                    already in resting cells (<REF>1</REF>). We hypothesized that activation was a consequence of the close proximity of calmodulin and M13 in the fusion even in the absence
                                    of calcium binding. In order to resolve this problem we set out to test a similar sensor based on two separate molecules. Two-molecule-based CaM sensors have not been
