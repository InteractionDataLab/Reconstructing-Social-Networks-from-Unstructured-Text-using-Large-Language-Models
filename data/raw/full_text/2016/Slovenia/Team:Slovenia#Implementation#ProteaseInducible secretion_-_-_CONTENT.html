								Further explanation ...
							</DIV><DIV class="content"><P>	Not many systems for the inducible release of proteins have been engineered to date. In one of the few examples Rivera et al. developed a system where the protein of interest 
								was fused to a conditional aggregation domain (CAD). <X-REF>Rivera2000</X-REF>. These domains form aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that are too large to exit the ER. 
								After the addition of a small synthetic molecule, the CADs start to disaggregate and the protein of interest can be secreted. In the second example Chen et al. introduced a 
								light-triggered secretion system. They also based their system on conditional aggregation; however they used the plant photoreceptor UVR8 which forms photolabile homodimers to make 
								aggregates on the ER membrane. Upon light excitation the aggregates made by UVR8 started to disaggregate and were transported from the ER to the plasma membrane, but have not been 
								observed in the cell supernatant. <X-REF>Chen2013</X-REF>
								The weakness of the two described systems is that they both rely on the exogenous chemical or physical signals instead of using a biochemical signal to induce the secretion, which
								means that they can’t be integrated into the signaling system that’s senses the cellular state. In order to better respond to the state of the cell or a logic circuit inside a cell 
								we decided to develop an inducible secretion system based on the biochemical signal.
							</P></DIV></DIV><P>Many proteins that reside on the membrane or in the lumen of the ER contain short peptide signals. Proteins present in the lumen of the ER contain a KDEL C-terminal sequence 
						(Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) while type I transmembrane (TM) proteins contain a dilysine (KKXX) motif on their C-terminus (cytosolic side). <X-REF> Munro1987, Jackson1990,
						Stornaiuolo2003</X-REF>. The mechanism that allows these proteins to stay in the ER is more retrieval than retention. However we decided to use the term retention for 
						description of this process. ER luminal proteins interact with the KDEL receptor, a transmembrane ER resident protein. The cytosolic part of the KDEL receptor interacts with 
						coat proteins I (COP I) which coat vesicles and are responsible for transporting proteins from the cis end of the Golgi apparatus (cis-GA) back to the ER. The KKXX motif present
						on type I TM proteins can directly interact with the COP I for retrieval. <X-REF> Stornaiuolo2003, Letourneur1994 </X-REF>.</P><P>Our idea was that if we proteolytically remove the retention signal, the protein of interest would no longer be retrieved back to the ER and could be secreted from the cell.
						To achieve this we designed two types of secretory reporters, one type based on the luminal retention using KDEL sequence and the other based on the transmembrane retention with
						a KKMP sequence. In each case, the retention sequence was preceded by a TEVp cleavage site to allow for inducible secretion, which could be replaced by any other peptide target
						of our orthogonal protease set.</P></DIV><H1><SPAN class="section"> </SPAN>Results</H1><DIV class="ui segment"><H3>Secretion from the ER lumen</H3><P>To achieve and detect the inducible secretion from the ER lumen, we created two reporter constructs with a cleavable KDEL sequence targeted to the ER lumen: SEAP<SUP>KDEL</SUP> and

								Further explanation ...
							</DIV><DIV class="content"><P>
								In order to rely on TEVp cleavage in the ER lumen, we had to take some additional considerations into account. Cesaratto et al.Cesaratto2015 reported that the wild 
								type TEV protease is not active in the lumen of ER. They designed a TEV protease variant active in the endoplasmic reticulum by preventing two major types of post-translational 
								modifications: N-glycosylation and cysteine oxidation. To avoid these inhibiting modifications, mutations N23Q, C130S and N171T were made. To ensure correct localization and 
								accumulation of this TEVp variant inside the endoplasmic reticulum, we also attached a signal sequence at the N-terminus and KDEL at the C-terminus of the protein.

							removed from the reporter and the protein was secreted from the cell, which we detected with Western blot (<REF>1</REF>C), demonstrating that proteolytic activity in the ER can

							motif on the cytoplasmic side, N-terminal to the KKMP peptide. A transmembrane (TM) domain from the B-cell receptor 
							(<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K157010">Bba_K157010</A>) was used for the integration of target proteins in the ER membrane. Similar as described above, two reporter 
							constructs with SEAP and TagRFP (SEAP:TM<SUP>KKMP</SUP> and TagRFP:TM<SUP>KKMP</SUP>) were designed and the constructs also contained a signal sequence at their N-terminus and a 
							proteolytically cleavable ER retention signal at their C-terminus. In case of the transmembrane targeted reporters we used the KKMP retention signal preceded by 3 copies of the 
							TEVp cleavage site on the cytosolic side of the membrane.</P><P>Additionally, either one or four furin cleavage sites were inserted between the protein of interest on the luminal side of the ER, which enable cleavage of the reporter 
							protein from the membrane, but this could occur only after the KKMP had been removed and the protein could enter the trans-GA. Furin is a native cellular endoprotease that is 
							active only in the trans-GA.Henrich2003 This allowed us to design our constructs so that they are cleaved off of the membrane without any modified scar sequences
