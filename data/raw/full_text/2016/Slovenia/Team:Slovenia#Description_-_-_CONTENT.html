                            industrial processes to cell-based therapy. However, the large majority of designed cellular
                            circuits are based on transcriptional regulation, which may be too slow for many
                            therapeutic or diagnostic applications, for example delivery of insulin or detection of a
                            metabolite. Several medical doctors and researchers that we consulted stressed that a fast
                            but controllable response is high on their wish list of expectations from synthetic biology.
                            Additionally, noninvasive stimulation of selected tissues in the organism would also be
                            highly desirable. While light is extremely useful as a rapid, spatially-restricted input
                            signal, it cannot penetrate deep into the tissue. On the other hand, ultrasound combines
                            several advantages of light with the added ability to penetrate tissue.</P><P>In our project we enhanced the sensitivity of mammalian cells to ultrasound or other
                            mechanical stimuli by introduction of bacterial or engineered mammalian mechanosensors.
                            Additionally, the response to ultrasound and touch was strongly increased by expression of
                            the two components of bacterial gas vesicles, GvpA and GvpC. Mechanosensing was detected by
                            the calcium-induced calmodulin-M13 complex reconstituting split cyclic luciferase, highly
                            applicable for the emerging field of mechanogenetics. This enabled us to draw on cells using
                            touch, where we engaged in collaboration with the artist Laura Olalde.</P><P>For the rapid response of cells to multiple stimuli we designed proteolysis-based signaling
                            pathways. Four orthogonal split proteases were generated, each recognizing
                            its own motif of seven amino acid residues. Based on cleavage of coiled-coil dimerizing
                            domains we demonstrated the ability to implement proteolysis-based signal pathways and logic
                            functions in mammalian cells. Based on the cleavage of an ER retention peptide by a
                            protease, input signals led to protein secretion without the slow step of induced protein
                            synthesis.</P><P>We believe that this project introduced several foundational advances that could be very
                            useful to synthetic biology far beyond iGEM and for the benefit of humanity for therapy,
                            diagnostics and potentially many other advanced applications.</P></DIV><DIV class="ui segment"><H4><SPAN id="plain" class="section colorize"> </SPAN>Abstract in plain English</H4><P>
                            Synthetic biology aims to control cells so they can obey our commands and do what we want,
                            for example produce drugs when needed. In our project we made cells which respond to ultrasound
                            or touch. When we touch the cells they light up, which can be recorded on a camera. Ideally
                            we want cells to respond to our commands as fast as possible, because sometimes we can’t
                            wait an hour before the cells produce the medicine and release it. That is why we gave cells
                            a novel mechanism of processing information.
                            We achieved this by combining several enzymes that recognize very specific parts of proteins
                            and cut them, which changes their function. This allowed us to combine different signals,
                            like sound, touch, light or chemicals, to obtain the desired cell response. The new enzymes
                            can also cut the anchor with which medicines are attached to cells after the cells make
                            them. Among many possible uses of our inventions, we can imagine activating cells in the
                            brain by ultrasound, which means that we don’t need to use
                            surgery to help people with Parkinson’s disease, or can trigger fast production of insulin
                            in the body, to help people with diabetes.

						GvpC protein. This protein is one of two proteins that compose protein gas vesicles, which were used in our project to enhance the sensitivity of mammalian 
						cells to mechanical stimuli. We improved the part by adding a FLAG tag, which allowed us to analyze the expression of the part form the cells via western blot and
						to observe the subcellular localization of the protein by confocal microscopy. We further characterized the part by expressing it in mammalian cells together with 
						GvpA, showing that these proteins substantially increase the cell sensitivity to ultrasound. This part also plays a central role in our Mechanosensing collection.</P><P>We also improved  <A href=" http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K157010:Experience"> BBa_K157010</A>, a transmembrane domain used by 2008 iGEM Freiburg team. We used this domain as 
						an anchor to which we attached the TagRFP protein on the N-terminal side and the ER retention signal on the C-terminal side. By western blots and confocal fluorescent
						microcopy we were able to show that this part can not only be used for plasma membrane localization but can also be retained in the ER with the simple addition of a
						4-amino-acid retention signal KKMP. Upon induced proteolytic cleavage of the retention signal by inducible split protease, the protein was translocated to the trans 
						GA and the plasma membrane, where TagRFP was cleaved by furin and secreted into the medium.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
