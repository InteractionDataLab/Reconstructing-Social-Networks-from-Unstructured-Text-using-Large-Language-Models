                                cleavage of an inactive enzyme. The cleavable luciferase inverse reporter assay is
                                expected to be relatively insensitive as a large fraction of the luciferase, typically
                                more than 20%, has to be degraded before an appreciable difference in the output is
                                detected, while an assay that leads to activation of luciferase might be able to detect
                                much proteolytic activity.

                                    fragments would dissociate, in turn decreasing the fLuc activity. In this system
                                    higher protease activity corresponds to a lower luciferase activity. The reporters

                                    version of the firefly luciferase (cpLuc). Luciferase is an oxidative enzyme that
                                    produces bioluminescence. The protein consists of two compact domains: the larger
                                    N- and the smaller C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain is connected to the

                                    fragments that allow protein splicing and cyclization by formation of a new peptide
                                    bond between the N- and C-termini of the protein, which generates an inactive
                                    protein that can be activated by the proteolytic cleavage. We expected this reporter
                                    to result in a higher signal from the cpLuc due to the stabilization of the

                                    sequence is excised along with the intein fragments during the splicing reaction
