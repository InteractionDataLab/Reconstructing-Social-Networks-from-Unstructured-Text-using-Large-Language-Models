										Our project required a sensitive and fast method for detecting cytosolic calcium concentrations. 
										This measurement is a fast-relay system, has low response at the physiological cytosolic level of calcium and works <I>in vivo</I> in mammalian cells.
									
									
										<H3 style="clear:both">Sensor development and characterization</H3><P>While calcium influx could be detected by exogenous fluorescent dyes such as Fura Red and Fluo-4, our project required a sensitive, genetically 
											encoded calcium sensor that would couple a change in the calcium concentration to a biologically relevant output, such as the luciferase reporter or
											reconstitution of a split protease for the initiation of the signaling pathway. An ideal calcium sensor should be inactive at intracellular concentration 
											of calcium and have a high response to calcium concentrations above physiological levels and should be detected by a quick and easy readout. For our
											intended application, the calcium sensor should also have the potential to act as the reconstitution mechanism for split proteins so that a conformational 
											rearrangement in the presence of calcium would bring the two split protein fragments together and reconstitute the protein’s activity.</P><P>A wide palette of genetically encoded calcium sensors have been used for mapping intracellular calcium concentration <X-REF>Whitaker2010</X-REF>, 
											including calmodulin, troponin C and aequorin <X-REF>Wilms2014</X-REF>. These reporters are based on different mechanisms of detection. From this abundant 
											collection we selected calmodulin (CaM)-based calcium sensors (in particular CaMeleons), since their mechanism is based on a large conformational change, 
											allowing reconstitution of split proteins <X-REF>Whitaker2010</X-REF>.</P><P>We replaced the FRET pair of CaMeleon2.12 by a split firefly luciferase (fLuc) as it provides a distinct signal even at small amounts and has a high 
											signal-to-noise ratio. The new luciferase based calcium sensor was named fLuc2.12. The fLuc2.12 was tested on HEK293 cells, but we found that the sensor
											was active already in resting cells (<REF>1</REF>). We hypothesized the activation was a consequence of a close proximity of calmodulin and M13 in the 
											fusion even in the absence of calcium binding. In order to resolve this problem we set out to test a similar sensor based on two separate molecules. 
											Two-molecule-based CaM sensors have not been widely used, but lower leakage in comparison to a single molecule sensor has been reported by Miyawaki 
											<I>et al.</I><X-REF>Miyawaki1997</X-REF>.</P></DIV><DIV class="ui segment"><DIV style="float:right; width:50%"><FIGURE data-ref="1"><FIGCAPTION><B>A luminescence calcium sensor based on the calmodulin-M13 fusion fLuc2.12 has high activity already at the resting levels of calcium.</B><P style="text-align:justify">HEK293T cells were transfected with 50 ng fLuc2.12. 24 h after transfection luciferase activities were measured immediately after
