 Protease-based inducible         secretion
Retention of proteins in ER lumen was demonstrated by confocal microscopy and            detection of the protein in the cell medium.
A variant of TEVp active in the ER lumen was implemented to control protein            secretion from the ER lumen.
Retention of proteins on the ER membrane was also demonstrated by confocal            microscopy and detection of the protein in the cell medium.
Rapamycin induced cleavage was used for controlled and inducible secretion of            proteins from the ER membrane.
 
To achieve a fast regulated cellular response resulting in the protein release, we                                 decided to mimic the release of insulin from beta cells where the protein of                                 interest is pre-formed and present intracellularly in secretory granules. In contrast to the                                 specialized storage and release mechanism of insulin from beta cells we wanted to                                 develop a more general and modular solution by making use of components already existing                                 in different types of cells. Additionally, there should be minimal leakage from the                                 protein depot in the uninduced state and after induction secretion from the cell should                                 be fast.

Not many systems for the inducible release of proteins have been engineered to                                         date. In one of the few examples Rivera et al. developed a system where the                                         protein of interest                                         was fused to a conditional aggregation domain (CAD)
Rivera2000
. These domains form aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that are too                                         large to exit the ER.                                         After the addition of a small synthetic molecule, the CADs start to disaggregate                                         and the protein of interest can be secreted. In the second example Chen et al.                                         introduced a                                         light-triggered secretion system. They also based their system on conditional                                         aggregation; however they used the plant photoreceptor UVR8 which forms                                         photolabile homodimers to make                                         aggregates on the ER membrane. Upon light excitation the aggregates made by UVR8                                         started to disaggregate and were transported from the ER to the plasma membrane,                                         but have not been                                         observed in the cell supernatant

.                                         The weakness of the two described systems is that they both rely on the                                         exogenous chemical or physical signals instead of using a biochemical signal to                                         induce the secretion, which                                         means that they can’t be integrated into the signaling system that’s senses the                                         cellular state. In order to better respond to the state of the cell or a logic                                         circuit inside a cell                                         we decided to develop an inducible secretion system based on the biochemical                                         signal.
Many proteins that reside on the membrane or in the lumen of the ER contain short                                 peptide signals. Proteins present in the lumen of the ER contain a KDEL C-terminal                                 sequence                                 (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) while type I transmembrane (TM) proteins contain a dilysine (KKXX)                                 motif on their C-terminus (cytosolic side)
Munro1987, Jackson1990, Stornaiuolo2003
.                                 . The mechanism that allows these proteins to stay in the ER is retrieval rather than                                 retention. However, we decided to use the term retention for description of this process. ER luminal proteins interact with the KDEL receptor, a                                 transmembrane ER resident protein. The cytosolic part of the KDEL receptor interacts                                 with                                 coat proteins I (COP I) which coat vesicles and are responsible for transporting                                 proteins from the cis end of the Golgi apparatus (cis-GA) back to the ER. The KKXX motif                                 present                                 on type I TM proteins can directly interact with the COP I for retrieval
Stornaiuolo2003, Letourneur1994
.
Our idea was that if we proteolytically remove the retention signal, the protein of                                 interest would no longer be retrieved back to the ER and could be secreted from the                                 cell.                                 To achieve this we designed two types of secretory reporters, one type based on the                                 luminal retention using KDEL sequence and the other based on the transmembrane retention                                 with                                 a KKMP sequence. In each case, the retention sequence was preceded by a TEVp cleavage                                 site to allow for inducible secretion, which could be replaced by any other peptide                                 target                                 of our orthogonal protease set .
 Results
 Release from the ER lumen and secretion from the cell
To achieve and detect the inducible secretion from the ER lumen, we created two reporter                                 constructs with a cleavable KDEL sequence targeted to the ER lumen: SEAPKDEL and                                 TagRFPKDEL. Those proteins contained a protease target motif between the                                 reporter domain and the KDEL domain, aimed to enable protein secretion after the                                 proteolytic cleavage.                                 We used a TEVp variant (erTEVp) for all of our experiments with luminal retention.
Further explanation ...
In order to rely on TEVp cleavage in the ER lumen, we had to take some                                         additional considerations into account. Cesaratto et al. Cesaratto2015 reported that the wild                                         type TEV protease is not active in the lumen of ER. They designed a TEV protease                                         variant active in the endoplasmic reticulum by preventing two major types of                                         post-translational                                         modifications: N-glycosylation and cysteine oxidation. To avoid these inhibiting                                         modifications, mutations N23Q, C130S and N171T were made. To ensure correct                                         localization and                                         accumulation of this TEVp variant inside the endoplasmic reticulum, we also                                         attached an ER signal sequence at the N-terminus and KDEL at the C-terminus of the                                         protein.
Cleavage with ER-residing protease (erTEV) facilitates secretion of                                         reporter from cells.
(A) Scheme of the reporter with cleavable KDEL                                             retention signal and protease target motif.                                             (B) The reporter with the KDEL retention signal was localized in the ER.                                             HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated reporters and in (C) also                                             with erTEVp.                                             Localization was detected with confocal microscopy. (C)The reporter was                                             detected in the medium of cells only when cotransfected with erTEVp. HEK293T                                             cells were transfected                                             with the indicated constructs. Reporters were detected with WB in the                                             concentrated medium.
When the TagRFPKDEL reporter (
1
A) was expressed in the ER without an active erTEVp we confirmed its localization in the                                 ER with confocal microscopy                                 (
1
B). Additionally, we could not detect any TagRFP in the cell medium with Western                                 blotting. When erTEVp was present and active in the ER, the KDEL sequence was                                 removed from the reporter and the protein was secreted from the cell, which we detected                                 with Western blot (
1
C). This demonstrated that proteolytic activity in the ER can                                 regulate protein secretion.
Using SEAPKDEL we were able to confirm that the reporter is                                 not present in the cell medium without coexpression of erTEVp. When erTEVp was                                 cotransfected with                                 the reporter, we detected a large increase in enzymatic activity in the medium (

Secretion of the SEAP reporter from ER lumen by cleavage with                                         ER-resident protease.
HEK293T cells were transfected with indicated                                             reporter and erTEVp. Increased SEAP activity was detected in the medium of                                             cells                                             expressing both reporter and erTEVp protease.
 Release from the ER membrane and secretion from the cell
The second approach to regulate protein secretion from the ER by protease was to used                                 KKMP ER retention peptide linked to the transmembrane protein with a protease target                                 motif on the cytoplasmic side, N-terminally to the KKMP peptide. A transmembrane (TM)                                 domain from the B-cell receptor                                 ( Bba_K157010 ) was used for the                                 integration of target proteins in the ER membrane. Similar as described above, two                                 reporter                                 constructs with SEAP and TagRFP (SEAP:TMKKMP and TagRFP:TMKKMP)                                 were designed and the constructs also contained a signal sequence at their N-terminus                                 and a                                 proteolytically cleavable ER retention signal at their C-terminus. In case of                                 transmembrane targeted reporters we used the KKMP retention signal preceded by 3 copies                                 of the                                 TEVp cleavage site on the cytosolic side of the membrane.
Additionally, either one or four furin cleavage sites were inserted between the protein                                 of interest on the luminal side of the ER, which enable cleavage of the reporter                                 protein from the membrane, but this could only occur after the KKMP had been removed and                                 the protein could enter the trans-GA. Furin is a native cellular endoprotease that is                                 active only in the trans-GA.Henrich2003 This allowed us to design our                                 constructs so that they are cleaved off of the membrane without any modified scar                                 sequences                                 attached to them.
Localization of protease-responsive reporters on ER depending on the                                         proteolysis.
(A) The transmembrane reporter without the KKMP                                             retention signal was localized both on the ER and plasma membrane. (B) The                                             transmembrane reporter with the KKMP retention                                             signal was localized exclusively on the ER membrane. (C) After cleavage of                                             the KKMP retention signal, the transmembrane reporter translocated to the                                             plasma membrane. HEK293T                                             cells were transfected with the indicated reporters and in (C) also with                                             TEVp. Localization was detected with confocal microscopy. Each image is                                             accompanied with a scheme of                                             the transfected construct. (D) Glycosylated reporter was detected in the                                             medium of cells transfected with the transmembrane reporter without the KKMP                                             retention signal.                                             HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. Reporters were                                             detected with WB in the concentrated medium. In lane 2, sample was incubated                                             with N-glycosidase                                             F.
Inducible secretion of reporter localized on ER membrane.
SEAP activity was increased in the medium of cells                                             induced with rapamycin. Scheme of the transmembrane reporter with                                             cleavable KKMP retention signal and inducible protease.                                             HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated reporter and rapamycin                                             inducible split proteases. Uncleaved proteases were used as positive                                             control.
Localization of the TagRFP:TMKKMP reporter was confirmed by the confocal                                 microscopy. We used a control reporter without the KKMP retention signal (TagRFP:TM)                                 which we detected both on the ER and the plasma membrane (
3
A). In case of present KKMP retention signal, the reporter was detected only on the                                 ER                                 (
3
B). When TagRFP:TMKKMP was coexpressed with TEVp, localization of the                                 reporter was similar to the localization of the positive control (TagRFP:TM)                                 on the plasma membrane and the ER (
3
C).
A band with a slightly larger apparent size than the expected size of TagRFP (28 kDa) was                                 detected by Western blotting in cells transfected with TagRFP:TM. We showed that the                                 unexpected difference in size was due to glycosylation, as we detected the protein at                                 the expected size after deglycosylation of the medium sample with N-glycosidase F. We                                 were                                 unable to detect a corresponding band in the medium of cells transfected with                                 TagRFP:TMKKMP in the absence of the protease.
Together, these results confirm that localization and secretion of the protein reporter                                 with the transmembrane domain depends on the presence and proteolysis of the KKMP                                 retention signal and that proteolysis can be used to induce secretion of already                                 synthesized protein.
Finally, we cotransfected cells with SEAP:TMKKMP and                                 rapamycin-inducible split TEVp. We detected increased levels of the SEAP enzymatic                                 activity in the medium of                                 cells stimulated with rapamycin, which was dose dependent with respect to the amount of                                 the transfected reporter-coding plasmid (

). These results confirm that                                 secretion of a target protein can be made inducible by an externally supplied signal,                                 processed through our split protease system.
