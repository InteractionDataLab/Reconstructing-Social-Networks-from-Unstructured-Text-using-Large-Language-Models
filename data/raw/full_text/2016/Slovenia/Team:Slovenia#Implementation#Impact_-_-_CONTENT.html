						We have demonstrated cell activation by ultrasound, direct touch, and flow of liquid, which demonstrates that other direct or indirect 
						mechanical forces, such as the osmotic stress, pressure and others could be detected in this system. Mechano-sensing plays a very important 
						role in many biological senses, such as hearing, proprioception but also in senses that are developed only in some animals, such as the lateral 
						line of fish. It is likely that the systems based on our building modules might be able to detect gravity, acceleration and pressure. Delivery of the 
						mechano-sensing platform could be accomplished through viruses, which would probably be more appropriate for in vivo applications, where the focused 
						ultrasound will spatially limit the activation of targeted cells.</P></DIV><DIV class="ui segment"><H3><SPAN id="protease" class="section colorize"> </SPAN>Protease-based signaling</H3><P>Although the specificity of viral proteases have been described before, this is the first time that functional split protease variants are produced and characterized. 
						We envision that this toolset and moreover innovative synthetic protease-based signaling pathways will find their use for engineered cells. This system is based on modules 
						which already enabled us the design of several two-input logic functions <I>in vivo</I>, which suggest that more complex circuits could readily be constructed. Additionally, 
						it is likely that the number of orthogonal proteases could be further expanded. Point mutations of known proteases, such as the TEVpE and TEVpH demonstrate that the recognition 
						sites could further be engineered.  We demonstrated by simulation that the activation of selected logic functions can be relatively fast, while the system needs to be reset to
						the resting state considerably slowly, comparable to the transcriptional type of regulation, that is within hours. None of the active proteases was toxic to human cells, so 
						their implementation for signaling pathways does not seem to pose any problems to further developments. Release of proteins or peptides from cells has been demonstrated and
						the capacity of the secretory machinery for secretion will have to be investigated in details in comparison to the secretion via exocytosis, which could however also be triggered
						via influx of calcium, which is regulated by mechanosensors.</P></DIV><DIV class="ui segment"><H3><SPAN id="aplications" class="section colorize">nbsp;</SPAN>Research applications</H3><UL><LI>Following on the tracks of optogenetics such as investigation of cell activation including in vivo experiments</LI><LI>Investigation of the molecular mechanisms of mechanosensing</LI><LI>Refactoring or rewiring of biologicals senses</LI></UL><H3>Potential therapeutic/diagnostic applications</H3><UL><LI>Ultrasound-regulated therapeutic activation of neuronal, immunological or other cells</LI><LI>Development of sensors of mechanical stress or shear forces in the tissue</LI><LI><I>In situ</I> production of bioactive peptides/proteins regulated by the ultrasound (e.g. insulin, neurotransmitters or other bioactive molecules)</LI><LI>Complex signaling pathways and logic functions based on the proteolysis</LI></UL><H3>Envisioned long term applications</H3><UL><LI><B>Ultrasound-controlled therapeutic device</B></LI><DIV align="clear:left"><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Conceptual implementation of a therapeutic ultrasound-driven therapeutic device based on Sonicell</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><LI><B>Integrated electronic-biological devices</B></LI><LI><B>Cell-based interface - such as a touchpad,</B> more tightly integrated than for example the <A href="http://duoskin.media.mit.edu/">Temporary Tatoos by the MIT Media Labs</A></LI><LI><B>Repair/enhancement of the sense of touch</B></LI><LI><B>Introduction of new types of senses, such as proprioreception, gravity, flow...</B></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
