 Summary of                                 the main results on mechanosensing
We successfully engineered mechano-responsive cells by expressing                                         mechanosensitive ion channels MscS and P3:FAStm:TRPC1 in mammalian cells.
Localization of mechanosensitive channel TRPC1 on the plasma membrane was                                         demonstrated and improved by fusing it with segments of FAS receptor, including                                         the transmembrane domain.
Addition of gas-filled lipid microbubbles increased the sensitivity of mammalian                                         cells to ultrasound.
We demonstrated for the first time that gas vesicle-forming proteins are                                         expressed in a human cell line, are not toxic and improve the sensitivity of                                         cells to mechanical stimuli.
A custom-made ultrasound stimulation device (Moduson), suitable for use in                                         different experimental setups that require ultrasound stimulation of cells, was                                         developed.
New graphical analysis software that enables fast analysis of fluorescent                                         microscopy data was also developed to quantify the response to ultrasound                                         stimulation.
A new split calcium sensing/reporting system was designed that is able to report,                                         by emitting light, the increase of the cytosolic calcium ions induced by                                         mechanoreceptor stimulation.
 
Cells interact with other cells and the environment in various ways in order to                                 appropriately respond to microenvironment changes. An important extracellular physical                                 signal is represented                                 by mechanical forces and adaptation upon mechanical stimuli is crucial for regulating                                 the cell volume, signalization, growth, cell to cell interactions and overall                                 survival.
Mechanical forces such as changes in osmolality, fluid flow, gravity or direct pressure                                 result in changes in tension of the phospholipid bilayer, arrangement of the                                 cytoskeleton                                 and opening of cation-permeable channels.
This mechanism serves as a force-sensing system

. Furthermore, it has already been shown that living organisms can detect                                 and respond to mechanical stress generated by ultrasound, which represents an external stimulus with many potential applications

. Ultrasound                                 offers remarkable advantages over other external stimuli used for targeted cell                                 stimulation. In our project we aimed to explore the potential of mechanosensors and to                                 improve the sensitivity of cells to mechanical stimulation with the idea of designing                                 ultrasound-responsive devices.
