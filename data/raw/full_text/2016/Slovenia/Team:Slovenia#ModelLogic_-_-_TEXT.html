Fast response was obtained upon reconstitution of light inducible proteases used as input.
 
Engineering and designing biological circuits constitute a central core of synthetic                                 biology. In                                 the context of our                                 iGEM                                 project, one of the challenges was to create, tune and regulate novel pathways in living                                 cells                                 using a                                 fast-relay system.                                 The toolset of                                     orthogonal proteases that we developed worked as input for logic                                 function in mammalian cells . Therefore, here we propose schemes for implementation                                 of                                 all 14 non-trivial                                 two input                                 binary logic functions based on a protein-protein interaction (coiled coil) and                                 proteolysis                                 system in cells (

Scheme of all non-trivial two input logic functions.
Implementation of all 14 two input non-trivial logic operations           based on the proteolysis and coiled coil displacement. Note that in addition to the previously publishes coiled coil-based protease           sensor

we introduce an additional site for the proteolytic cleavage which enables implementation of           all logic functions in a single layer.
The main post-translational modification on which signaling and information processing                                 systems                                 are based is                                 protein                                 phosphorylation, which enables reversibility and fast response. Proteolysis is on the                                 other                                 hand                                 irreversible,                                 which                                 imposes some limitations with respect to phosphorylation. However for many applications                                 fast activation is most                                 important, while the time to reset the system in the resting state is of secondary                                 importance.
Our protein-based system is designed in such a way that it works through coiled coil                                 interactions, where each                                 coiled                                 coil in the system is either free or bound to its partner depending on the proteolytic                                 activity.                                 Furthermore,                                 the                                 signal                                 output is represented by reconstitution of a split protein (i.e. luciferase or                                 protease),                                 which                                 is fused                                 separately                                 to                                 different coiled coil segments. To prove the feasibility of this design, we simulated                                 the                                 system's behavior                                 using                                 deterministic modeling. The simulations were run in Wolfram Mathematica, using                                 xCellerator's                                 xlr8r                                 libraries.
The designed binary logic gates can be divided into 5 subgroups, based on the position of                                 the                                 protease cleavage                                 sites:
a) cleavage site between coiled coils: conjunction, disjunction and both projection                                     functions;
b) cleavage site between the coiled coil and split protease: logical NAND, logical                                     NOR                                     and                                     both                                     negations;
c) cleavage sites between coiled coils as well as between the coiled coil and split                                     protease                                     in                                     the same construct: material implication and converse implication;
d) cleavage sites between coiled coils as well as between the coiled coil and split                                     protease                                     in                                     different constructs: exclusive disjunction, logical biconditional, material                                     nonimplication                                     and                                     converse                                     nonimplication;
e) no cleavage sites: tautology and contradiction.
For applications that require fast response (e.g. protein secretion), which are                                 the purpose                                 of                                 our attempt, only                                 falsity                                 preserving gates are appropriate, as biological systems usually require fast activation                                 and                                 not                                 fast                                 deactivation.                                 The                                 following functions correspond to the desired condition: both projection functions,                                 conjunction,                                 disjunction,                                 exclusive                                 disjunction, material nonimplication, converse nonimplication and true.
Since the dynamics of both functions in subgroup e) is trivial, i.e. output is a                                 constant,                                 their                                 modeling is                                 omitted.                                 We selected a single function from the other four subgroups, for which a mathematical                                 model                                 was                                 established and                                 analyzed. We selected the following functions $f_1(x_1, x_2) = x_1$ from subgroup a),                                 $f_2(x_1,                                 x_2) = \neg(x_1                                 \vee                                 x_2)$ from b), $f_3(x_1, x_2) = x_2 \Rightarrow x_1$ from c) and $f_4(x_1, x_2) =                                 \neg(x_1                                 \Rightarrow x_2)$                                 from                                 d).
Inducible proteases were assumed as the two input variables for each function. The                                 logical                                 values true and false                                 were in                                 all the cases presented with high and low amounts of output proteins or input proteases,                                 respectively. Where the                                 output                                 signal is presented with several different proteins, the sum of their concentrations was                                 observed.

  Results
We simulated the dynamics of established logic gates with the numerical integration of                                 their                                 mathematical models                                 described in the previous paragraphs. The results of our simulations are shown in

They confirm our                                 assumption that all four types of logic functions offer shorter delay compared to their                                 equivalents based on                                 genetic                                 regulatory networks. The rise and fall times of our gates are simulated to be at around                                 70                                 seconds compared to                                 hours                                 that transcription regulation circuits usually require.

$x_1$ nimply $x_2$. The output concentration of the logical function                                         $x_1$                                         nimply $x_2$ is                                         shown                                         with                                         all four possible inputs in the following order (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).
Our system also allows us to shorten the lifetime of the output signal without                                 significantly                                 reducing its                                 concentrations by adding degradation tags to the output protein. The high output times                                 achieved                                 can even be                                 similar                                 to                                 the input light induction time of 1 minute. These two characteristics can importantly                                 influence                                 several                                 sequential                                 induction of logic gates and the further development of several layered logic circuits.
Shortened output time due to the addition of                                         degradation tags to the output                                         protein.
