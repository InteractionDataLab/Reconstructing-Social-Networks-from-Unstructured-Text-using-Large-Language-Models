The ultrasound (US) wave interacts with tissue and reflects back depending on the                             properties of the tissues such as velocity of sound in the tissues and its density, which                             can be modeled using the wave                                 equation. Higher frequencies have better resolution (shorter wavelengths) but                             cannot penetrate as deep into the tissue. In diagnostic ultrasound frequencies above 1                             MHz are used. For better tissue penetration frequencies of interest for our purposes are                             between 0.3 to 1 MHz yielding sufficient resolution and penetration at the same time

 MODUSON - Generating ultrasonic power                                 pulses for cell stimulation
For the simple setup of the ultrasonic stimulation of cells we initially used ultrasonic                                 baths (
1
) for cleaning the laboratory equipment, small devices to clean jewelry or                                 ultrasonic cell disruptors, which however offer little control over the intensity,                                 frequency or pulse shapes and numbers of repetitions and are not appropriate to monitor                                 activation of mechanosensors under the fluorescence microscope. However, one member of                                 the team is a student of electrical engineering and this was the right challenge for                                 him.
Different experiment configurations.
Different ultrasonic baths that are used to clean jewelry or labware were initially used to stimulate           cells in microtiter plates. Those devices however do not allow a significant control of the intensity, frequency, pulse duration and repetitions.           Homogeneity of pressure in each well with a plate immersed in the ultrasonic bath was tested with hydrophones and care was taken to maintain the            temperature.
For the generation of specific shapes of ultrasound pulses researchers usually use a                                 setup consisting of two signal generators (one for switching on and off the train of US                                 pulses and the other one to produce the sinusoidal signal of suitable frequency). This                                 signal is further fed to the amplifier and then to the ultrasonic transducer.                                 Furthermore, an ultrasonic sensor is required to evaluate and control the magnitude of                                 the ultrasound. Usually a hydrophone is used in combination with an amplifier and an                                 oscilloscope. This setup is complex to establish and difficult to use. Therefore, the                                 goal of a part of the iGEM 2016 group (student of electrical engineering) was to develop                                 a device (named Moduson), which would be capable of providing appropriate signals                                 required to perform specific ultrasonic experiments in a single apparatus and as such                                 easy to use. The research and development of the device was performed in the Laboratory                                 for Bioelectromagnetics at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of                                 Ljubljana under                                 the supervision of prof. dr. Dejan Križaj and a company Noeto.
 The basic requirements for the device and                                 realizations
Adaptability
The device should be designed to be as flexible as possible in order to be capable of                                 delivering a wide range and different shapes of stimulation signals to stimulate cells                                 under the microscope, cells in a petri dish, cells in a microplate immersed into a bath                                 and to stimulate animals. In order to fulfill this requirement we selected a dedicated                                 embedded measurement card Red Pitaya acting as an embedded computer. This embedded                                 device is based on Linux system and can be completely customized to the user’s needs.                                 Furthermore, it can be Wi-Fi controlled so the final application is based on modern                                 programming tools such as JavaScript, C++, HTML, etc. The final application is essentially                                 a web page, accessible with any computer with a Wi-Fi connection. This                                 application gives complete control over all stimulation parameters and operation of the                                 device. Another advantage of the platform used is its capability of simple integration                                 with                                 Matlab through a so-called SCPI commands, usually used in the instrumentation for easy                                 control and data acquisition making the device a perfect research and development tool.                                 Simple example of SCPI commands in Matlab for pulsed bursts is shown below:

Simple graphical user interface
Users of the device do not need to be computer experts and do not need to have knowledge                                 on signal generators, amplifiers and oscilloscopes. Therefore, the motivation was to                                 design and develop a simple user-friendly graphical interface with all the relevant                                 parameters that need to be set in order to run the experiments from the Web page. To                                 accomplish this, dedicated software was written that enables users to design and run the                                 experiment and evaluate the results.

presents a developed user interface. On the right side (US burst settings -> STIMULATION                                 PULSE) we can set parameters, such as the amplitude of the signal, frequency and number                                 of sine waves. Below these settings, repetition parameters of the signal (PULSE                                 REPETITION) such as the number of pulse repetitions and its frequency can be set. When                                 all parameters are set, the signal can be previewed by clicking the SHOW BURST button.                                 The pulse sequence is initiated with the START button. The acquired signal from                                 hydrophone is seen on the main plot. At the top of the interface, there are options to                                 export the image of a graph and csv data of the acquired signal. Chosen values of                                 parameters can also be saved for the next use of the device.

Equivalent model of ultrasonic transducer based on a BVD model that was simulated to provide 92 W of power.
We built the circuitry with real elements on a prototype board where several additional                                 alterations were required, as the real elements do not have ideal characteristics as the                                 ones included in the simulation (
7
). Another challenge was the design of a suitable                                 transformer to increase the voltage amplitude of the signal. The transformer is also                                 required to operate as an impedance transformer. Lowering impedance of the ultrasonic                                 transducer enables higher current levels and consequently higher power values.
Final look of the Moduson device from the inside and outside.
Constructed device was equipped with a simple interface; an ON/OFF button, a BNC output for the            transducer and a button to trigger stimulation pulses. All parameters are set by the Web interface that also provides the ability            to trigger the stimulation pulses. When we have more time we will develop a new version with more neatly arranged wiring.
Once a suitable signal is generated, it needs to be amplified from a signal level                                 (amplitude of 2 V) to several hundred volts or even above 1000 V, which poses a serious                                 engineering challenge. For this purpose, we first designed a circuitry on a conceptual                                 level and simulated it with LT Spice (
4
). In the simulations an electric model of a transducer was considered as a combination                                 of capacitors, inductors and resistors wired in parallel (
5
). This model enables simulation of ultrasonic transducers with several resonant                                 frequencies. Simulations show that our device can reach the power at transducer around                                 92W, which is close to the measured 86W in the real system.

MODUSON output signal without load
Typical output signal is shown, detected by te oscilloscope, where the amplitude of the acquired signal depends            on the winding of the transformer.
Developed device was tested with several transducers with resonance frequencies ranging                                 from 300 kHz up to 1 MHz. Most experiments were performed with an unfocused transducer                                 Olympus V318-SU (

presents measured electric power using the transducer V318-SU. After partial                                 compensation of reactive part, the measured real power reached 86 W. This result                                 exceeded the set requirements.
With compensation, voltage was considerably increased at contacts of transducer and                                 reached around 900 Vpp as shown in

We measured the emitted ultrasonic pressure indirectly with a hydrophone RP 31l shown in

. This hydrophone has a sensitivity of 50 mV/100 kPa at a frequency of 310 kHz. It can be                                 connected directly to the oscilloscope input to detect the pressure of the ultrasonic                                 waves. Pressure measured 4 mm from the transducer reached 700 kPa which gives the                                 intensity of 33 W/cm2.

Calibrated hydrophone was used to measure pressure in different experiments in order to determine the power            attenuation due to the absorbance of the plate, different geometry and ultrasound signal generation.

Based on calibration data of the hydrophone, we can determine pressure for each experimental setup, which corresponds to the acquired         voltage amplitude.
nbsp;Set-up for experiments with ultrasonic                             pulses
After we successfully tested the Moduson device, we aimed to design measurement set-up                             for stimulation of cells cultivated in plastic 6-well plates, which allows insertion of                             the ultrasound transducer. In order to ensure repeatable conditions in every experiment                             the position of a transducer was fixed with a suitable holder. Several models of holders                             were designed for different experimental configurations and a 3D-printer was used to                             fabricate a dedicated holder (
13
). This allowed positioning of the transducer at the fixed height above the bottom of a                             well (
14
), which was crucial due to the series of maximal and minimal intensity of generated                             pressure.
