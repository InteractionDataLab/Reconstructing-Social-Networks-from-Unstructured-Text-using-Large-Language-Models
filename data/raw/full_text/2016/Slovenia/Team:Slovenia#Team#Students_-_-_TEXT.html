Katja Leben
Field of study:
Biochemistry, MSc
Main contributions:
Calcium sensing system, ​cloning
​
Science crush:​
My love is uncovering the underlying mechanisms of immunological pathways, but lately I've started an exciting affair with synthetic biology.
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
Hanging from a rock cliff, reading a book.
Rok Krese

Biotechnology, BSc
Main contributions:
Activation of cells with ultrasound
The Master of Coin.
Science crush:
Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
Surfing, diving or travelling.
If we die, we'll die, but first we live.
Tjaša Plaper
Field of study:
Molecular and functional biology, MSc
Main contributions:
Protein retention and secretion from the cell
Science crush:
Imunology and microbiology
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
Travelling, drinking a beer with my friends or enjoying a quiet moment in nature with my dog.
Nik Franko
Field of study:
Microbiology, BSc Biotechnology, MSc
Main contributions:
Novel regulated protein secretion system, novel split proteases, QC
...cloning quicker than you would expect for a man of that size.
Science crush:
Synbio problems, biotech entrepreneurship
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
Collecting my thoughts in the gym or enjoying a chocolate gelato somewhere under the Mediterranean sun.
What do we say to the god of Wiki? Not today!
Lidija Magdevska

As I am. All or not at all.
Miha Gradišek
Field of study:
Electrical engineering, MSc
Main contributions:
Research and implementation of the system for ultrasonic stimulation
Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others, but you know are right in the long run.
Science crush:
Development of integrated circuits, research of biomedical influence of ultrasound on the observed tissue
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
Photoshooting nature somewhere in the wilderness.
When it comes to war, she fights for the lab, when it comes to science, she doesn't choose sides.
Estera Merljak
Field of study:
Biochemistry, MSc
Main contributions:
Confocal microscopy, cloning.
Science crush:
In the mysterious plasmid masquerade mammalian cells disguise as tea pots and ghosts, humoring few chosen for confocal microscopy. Only your own imagination is the limit of synthetic biology.
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
A great lyric coloratura soprano.

From this time to the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.
Science crush:
She is not into science, otherwise cardiovascular research.
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
outside of the lab, wouldn't I? Probably training judo or enjoying sunny beaches in Montenegro.
They found some of my…experiments…too bold.
Arne Praznik
