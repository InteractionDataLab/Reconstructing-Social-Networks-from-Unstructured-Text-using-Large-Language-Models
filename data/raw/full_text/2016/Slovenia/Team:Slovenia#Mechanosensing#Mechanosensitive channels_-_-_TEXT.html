mechanosensitive channels
Ectopically expressed mechanosensitive ion channels MscS and P3:FAStm:TRPC1                                         were used to enhance sensitivity of mammalian cells to ultrasound                                         stimulation.
Membrane localization of the mechanosensitive channel TRPC1 was improved by                                         fusing it with a FAS transmembrane domain, which also led to increased                                         sensitivity to ultrasound stimulation.

The detailed mechanism of mechanosensing is not known, however most mechanosensitive                                 receptors respond to mechanical stimuli through                                 opening of the channel pore and allowing calcium ions to enter the cell
Zheng2013
. Membrane composition has been shown to play                                 an important role in bacterial channel activation, however cytoskeleton apparently also                                 mediates mechanosensing as several mechanosensitive channels                                 comprise domains that can interact with the cytoskeleton (

We chose to test two mechanosensitive channels: human nonspecific cation channel TRPC1                                 and bacterial channel MscS, previously described as important receptors involved                                 in the response to mechanical stimulation in humans and bacteria

Transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1) is a human non-specific cation                                         channel located at the plasma membrane. It has been previously reported as                                         broadly expressed in human tissues where it functions as a store-operating                                         calcium channel

. It belongs to the TRP superfamily that                                         act as tetrameric transmembrane proteins consisting of a domain formed by six                                         transmembrane helices, with a pore between S5 and S6

.                                         These helices present the N- and C-termini to the cytoplasm, promoting the                                         formation of functional homo- or hetero-tetramers

The second channel that we selected is the bacterial mechanosensitive channel                                         MscS. Its role is to mediate turgor regulation in bacteria and is                                         activated by changes in osmotic pressure

It has been previously shown that MscS is a homoheptamer, each subunit is                                         31kDa in                                         size and contains three transmembrane helices with the N-terminus facing the                                         periplasm and the C-terminus embedded in the cytoplasm

(D) Ion channels MscS and TRPC1 were expressed in HEK293 cells. HEK293                                                 cells                                                 were transfected with plasmids encoding HA tagged MscS or Myc-tagged                                                 TRPC1.                                                 Expression by Western blot and localization by confocal microscopy were                                                 analyzed using anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies, respectively.
To improve membrane localization of TRPC1 we fused a FAS                                     transmembrane domain to TRPC1 (

A), since the                                     transmembrane FAS domain has been very efficient in Jerala lab for the membrane                                     localization
Majerle2015
. The strategy of adding an                                     additional transmembrane domain has to our knowledge not been applied before for the                                     ion channels. The addition of FAS transmembrane domain to the                                     N-terminus of TRPC1 improved localization of the protein to plasma membrane in                                     comparison to the unmodified TRPC1. From the confocal microscopy images                                     of non-permeabilized cells we verified that the modified channel was inserted into                                     plasma membrane as predicted, since in non-permeabilized cells antibodies                                     stained the exposed extracellular HA-tag but not the intracellular Myc-tag (

(B)                                                 Ion channel P3:FAStm:TRPC1 was                                                 localized to plasma membrane. HEK293 cells were transfected with                                                 P3:FAStm:TRPC1 plasmid. 24 h after transfection cells were permeabilized                                                 (upper) or non-permeabilized (lower) and stained with antibodies against                                                 HA and Myc-tag. Localization on plasma membrane is shown with arrows.
In addition to the improved membrane localization, the FAS                                     transmembrane domain linked to the TRPC1 presents another advantage. The TRPC1 is an                                     ion                                     channel with six transmembrane helices, therefore both the N- and the C-terminus of                                     the protein are orientated towards the interior of the cell. By addition                                     of the FAS transmembrane domain, the N-terminus of P3:FAStm:TRPC1 chimera (where P3                                     stands for coiled                                         coil ) is exposed in the extracellular                                     space and could interact with different proteins from outside the cell via the                                     N-terminal tag. We reasoned that this interaction could be used to achieve a higher                                     sensitivity to mechanical stimuli.
After we showed that the selected ion channels MscS, TRPC1 and P3:FAStm:TRPC1 are                                     expressed in HEK293 and localized at the plasma membrane, we further tested their                                     function as mechanosensors by exposing them to ultrasound stimulation.
 Ultrasound stimulation
Further explanation ...
Ultrasound stimulation offers potentially remarkable advantages over the                                             majority of external stimuli used for targeted cell stimulation.                                             Optogenetics, as another                                             promising approach to cell stimulation, requires invasive surgery to                                             implement optical fibers connected to the source of light – LED or laser

in order to target cells in tissue to activate or silence them. On the other                                             hand, ultrasound offers a non-invasive approach to overcome the problems                                             which appear in                                             the above mentioned method. Its use has been demonstrated potentially even                                             for noninvasive ultrasound therapy through an intact skull
Hynynen1998
.                                             Previously, ultrasound had been used in several in vitro studies to directly                                             stimulate clusters of neurons but also in few model organisms (among others
King2013
)                                             .
For mechanical stimulation of cells with ultrasound we designed our own unique experimental setup ,                                     which included the ultrasound device MODUSON that we constructed and connected to the unfocused transducer Olympus                                     V318-SU and a 3D printed support for a transducer to fix it at a defined position                                     relative to the cells. Stimulation conditions were optimized for our cell                                     line and experimental setup. To measure the changes of free calcium ion                                     concentration we stained cells with two fluorescent dyes Fura Red and Fluo-4.                                     The combination of these two dyes enabled us to present changes in the calcium ion                                     concentration as a ratio of the fluorescence intensity at two wavelengths,                                     which was superior to the intensity based measurements, since it is independent of                                     photobleaching and dye sequestration.
Further explanation ...
Fura Red and Fluo-4 are visible light-excitable dyes used for ratiometric                                             measurement of calcium ions which excitation maximum is at 488 nm. While Fluo-4 exhibits an increase in fluorescence emission at 515 nm upon                                             binding of calcium ions, fluorescence emission at 655 nm of Fura Red                                             decreases once the indicator binds calcium ions. By calculating the ratio of                                             fluorescence emission intensities captured at 488 nm exaction                                             (where the difference of fluorescence between the bound and free indicator                                             is at its maximum), we could observe changes in intracellular                                             calcium concentrations in real time.
We followed changes of calcium concentration after ultrasound stimulation in real                                     time using ratiometric confocal microscopy. For processing of data we                                     developed our software CaPTURE , which                                     automatically calculated the ratio between fluorescence                                     intensities of FuraRed and Fluo-4 and presented the data as image and calculated                                     values.
We showed that by expressing the MscS channel cells gained sensitivity for                                     ultrasound stimulation in comparison to non-transfected cells (

and

).                                     Influx of calcium ions was observed at a lower rate in the case of ectopically                                     expressed TRPC1 (data not shown), probably due to its poor membrane localization.
Cells expressing exogenous MscS channels gained sensitivity                                             for ultrasound stimulation.

Fusion of the FAS transmembrane domain to TRPC1 did not only                                     improve its membrane localization, but also significantly enhanced its sensitivity                                     to ultrasound                                     stimulation (

HEK293 cells expressing P3:FAS:TRPC1 were stimulated with ultrasound for                                                 10                                                 s and calcium influx was recorded in real time (D) using a confocal                                                 microscope. For comparison                                                 cells without ectopic MscS were used. Fluo-4 (D, green line) and Fura                                                 Red                                                 dyes (D, red line) were used for ratiometric calcium imaging. (D) Ratio                                                 (blue line) was calculated                                                 from fluorescence intensities of Fura Red and Fluo-4 using CaPTURE .
In order to observe mechanostimulation of cells with ectopically                                     expressed mechanoreceptors we had to use high-power ultrasound. However, we tested                                     that the cells nevertheless                                     did not lose the viability by ultrasound stimulation. Our next challenge was to                                     further improve sensitivity of cells to respond to lower power ultrasound as this                                     would avoid                                     stimulation of any endogenous channels and limit stimulation only to the engineered.
