Various extraordinary synthetic biology projects can be depicted as boats and ships, seeking the safety of a harbor in the wide ocean, their main purpose        finding the final destination.
No matter how different or fascinating the boat is, its main purpose is to safely arrive to the harbor. Before there were modern GPS systems, sailors       had to rely on using natural events and signs. One of the main was the lodestar, the most shining star, which is always a good orientation point.
Similarly, many research projects can struggle no matter how fascinating they are. They might lose the feeling of reality and just travel for the sake of travel.
In order to give the right coordinates, which showed to be of high importance in our case, we developed a new symbol for future iGEM teams who might apply their        projects to the medical field – community oriented lodestar. No matter if the team is competing in the foundational advance or medical application section, maximization       of the benefit to society should be the number one priority.

Consequently, if ever lost, teams should just find the shining star and orient in respect to it. By thorough discussions and careful implementation of ideas       provided by all the participants involved in the dialogue, iGEM team should be able to present at the Giant Jamboree the most of the project –completely analyzed project        in real life. It’s not only the idea that influences the minds and thinking of individuals involved, the relationship is reciprocal. People involved have a great       deal of influence over the idea itself as well. The concept will be explained on our example. While competing in the foundational advance track we have considered       many possible medical applications of our project, particularly diabetes, Parkinson’s disease and hemorrhagic diseases, since medicine is the field of study of several       students and other students and mentors have a soft spot for this direction. .
