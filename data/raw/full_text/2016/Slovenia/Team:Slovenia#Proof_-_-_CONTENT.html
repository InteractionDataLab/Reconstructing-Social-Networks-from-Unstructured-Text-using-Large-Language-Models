                                appropriate for the stimulation of deep tissue, other mechanical stimuli
                                could also trigger activation of mechanosensors. Mechanical stimulation appears to be a
                                critical modulator for many aspects of biology, both of living tissue and
                                cells

                                mechanosensitive channels have been implemented. Among the activators of mechanosensors,
                                hyperosmolarity has been shown to trigger the activation of certain genes
                                <X-REF>Veltmann</X-REF>. Additional mechanical stimuli such as fluid shear stress causes activation of

                                stimulation by direct contact that underlies the sense of touch. Our designed
                                mechano-responsive system is composed of two modules. Firstly we included modules to
                                provide and increase the sensitivity to mechanical stress by

                                    vesicles</A>. Secondly, the influx of calcium is visualized by the
                                <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Slovenia/Mechanosensing/CaDependent_mediator#split">dimerization
                                    of calmodulin</A> (attached to the C terminus of split luciferase) and M13
                                (attached to the N terminus of split luciferase) which results in bioluminescence after
                                the reconstitution of split luciferase. This means that this system is able to
                                convert the mechanical stimulus into light signal, or to put it differently, with our
                                system we are able to <B>see when cells are touched</B>.
                            </P><P>Shear flow also exerts mechanical force on cells, which also has relevance for the
                                endothelial cells within blood vessels, therefore also the flow of the liquid
                                medium around cells might be sensed by cells. The experiment to test this ability was
                                performed by agitating the petri dish with attached cells. In order to identify
                                if the engineered cells are able to respond to the shear flow we included control cells
                                that either constitutively express the luciferase and cells that harbour only
                                the calcium-dependent reporter without constructs to increase the mechanosensing along
                                with cells expressing the gas vesicles and reporters.

                                triggered activation of the luciferase, with significantly higher level in cells that
                                harboured gas vesicles in addition to the reporter, demonstrating that activation
                                does not require high pressure on cells.
                            </P><P>Next we wondered if cells could respond to a gentle touch. We were excited to see that
                                already in the first experiment we could clearly see where cells have been
                                touched by a glass rod. The best paintbush to stimulate cells without removing them from
                                the plate has yet to be identified but we found that glass rod functions quite
                                well. We realized that we could use touch to illuminate cells, effectively painting or
                                drawing on cells by recording the trace with emitted light, which we called
                                Touchpaint. At that time the <B>Argentinian visual artist Laura Olalde</B>, PhD,
                                interested in arts and science symbiosis, and interested in connections between art and

                                visited our lab. She was immediately eager to test <B>Touchpaint</B> as the new artistic
                                medium, which enables us to transfer the sense of touch into light.

                                Laura prepared several stamps and we experimented with different methods of cell
                                immobilization on the plate, however due to the time constraints of the
                                iGEM project we have yet to explore the intricacies of Touchpaint techniques. Response
                                of the system is quite fast as the sequential drawing of letters of the
                                iGEM acronym already started to fade by drawing the text letter few minutes after the
                                first one, therefore real time monitoring of cell drawing is a very realistic
                                proposition. While Touchpaint is just one artistic implementation of the technology,
                                there are many other scientific and applied uses of this technology,
                                which are discussed in the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Slovenia/Implementation/Impact">Impact section</A>.
