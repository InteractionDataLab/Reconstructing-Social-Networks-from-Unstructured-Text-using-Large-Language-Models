Three light inducible split proteases were designed and shown to rapidly                                             respond to stimulation with blue light.
 
In the recent years, light has been extensively explored as a trigger signal for                                 activation of different biological processes. Small molecules and other chemical                                 signals lack spatial resolution and their temporal resolution is limited by the time                                 required for cell permeation. In comparison, induction by light as developed by                                 optogenetics offers many advantages. It is fast as well as inexpensive and allows                                 for excellent spatial, temporal and dose-dependent control.

There is a plethora of various light inducible systems available; however, not                                         many are applicable to our purpose. Red light induced systems like the PhyB/PIF6 system                                          require an                                         additional phytochrome
Zimmerman2016
, while the UV light used to induce some systems like UVR
Schmidt2015
might be toxic to the cells and                                         the system can only be induced once
Niopek2014
. Therefore, we selected systems responsive to blue light for the purpose of our iGEM project.                                         Of these, the FKF1/GIGANTEA system displays slow association and dissociation rates
Guntas2015
, making it impractical for fast response purposes, while VVD displays                                         fast response, but is a homodimer
Zhang2015
, making it unsuitable for successful heterodimerization of split enzymes.
Initially we decided to test the LOVpep/ePDZ system. This system has been used                                 previously at iGEM, by EPF_Lausanne 2009 , Rutgers 2011 and Rutgers 2012 and in mammalian cells by Freiburg_2014 .                                 AsLOV2 is a small photosensory domain from Avena sativa phototropin 1 with a C-terminal Jα helix. The Jα helix is caged in darkness but unfolds                                 upon blue light (< 500 nm) photoexcitation, which is crucial for phototropin                                 signalling.
Further explanation ...
A photosensor has been prepared by engineering the AsLOV2 domain to contain a                                         peptide epitope SSADTWV on the C-terminus of the Jα helix (LOVpep), binding an                                         engineered                                         Erbin PDZ domain (ePDZ) upon blue light stimulation
Stricklandetal.2012
. This system has already been used for iGEM projects ( Freiburg_2014 ).
nbsp;Results
 LOVpep and ePDZb
For initial testing and characterization of the system, we fused LOVpep and ePDZb
Muller2014
to corresponding segments of the                                    split                                         firefly luciferase (
1
). We tested different positions of the split protein on                                     the PDZ domain,                                     while the split protein was kept at the N-terminus of the LOVpep domain due to the                                     importance of the C-terminal peptide epitope. We also tested different ratios of both parts of the dimerizing system to determine the optimal conditions for further experiments (

B).
The LOVpep/ePDZ light inducible system fused to the split firefly                                             luciferase.
As luciferase activity was highest with split luciferase on the N-terminus of the                                     ePDZ domain and a 1:3 ratio of the LOVpep:ePDZ constructs, all subsequent experiments were                                     performed with this conditions. An important feature for real life applications is the                                     ability of the system to be stimulated multiple times. Therefore, repeated                                     association                                     and dissociation was tested in real time, by adding luciferin to the medium and                                     measuring luciferase activity upon induction by light (

C). The system exhibited                                     a delayed, but successful induction the first time, but the second induction was                                     much weaker. These results indicate that the LOVpep/ePDZ system in this setup could                                     not be                                     induced more than once, so we decided to test an additional system.

(B) Light inducible reporter with split                                                 luciferase at the N-terminus of the ePDZ domain (nLuc:ePDZb) responded to                                                 light more efficiently than ePDZ:nLuc. Corresponding schematic representations of                                                 different arrangements                                                 of ePDZ fused to the N-terminal segment of split firefly luciferase (nLuc) are shown above the graph. After induction with blue light at 460nm the cells                                                 transfected with LOVpep/ePDZ reporter system were lysed and                                                 luciferase activity was determined                                                 with the dual luciferase assay. (C) The LOVpep/ePDZ system responded to light stimulation                                                 only once. Following the addition of luciferin to the medium the cells                                                 were induced or                                                 left in the dark for indicated periods.
 CRY2PHR-CIBN
As it has previously been shown on the example of split Cre recombinase
Kennedy2010
the CRY2/CIB1 interaction upon excitation with blue light seems to be a suitable tool for the                                     reconstitution of split proteins, allowing for spatial, temporal and dose-dependent                                     optical control of protein dimerization. The CRY2/CIB1 system has also been used before at                                     iGEM: Duke 2012 , Marburg 2013 , HNU_China 2014 and ANU_Canberra 2015
Further explanation ...
CRY2 is a cryptochrome, originating from Arabidopsis thaliana and is a blue                                             light–absorbing photosensor that binds a helix-loop-helix DNA-binding                                             protein CIB1 in                                             its photoexcited state. In our system, we used the conserved N-terminal                                             photolyase homology region of CRY2 (CRY2PHR; aa 1-498) that mediates light-responsiveness and                                             the truncated version of the CIB1 protein (CIBN; aa 1-170) without the                                             helix-loop-helix region, which mediates DNA binding

. Dimerization of                                             CRY2PHR and CIBN can be induced by blue light illumination (460 nm), after                                             which the interaction between CRY2 and CIB1 occurs on a millisecond                                             timescale and can be                                             reversed within minutes by removing the stimulus. This light inducible                                             system has already been implemented for light-dependent transcriptional                                             activation with the Gal4                                             transcription factor

and the CRISPR/Cas9 system
He2015
. Another application of the system                                             is induction of whole-protein dimerization
Wend2014
or split protein dimerization

.
We adapted this system for the reconstitution of split luciferase                                     to create a blue-light sensor, which enables easy characterization for further                                     experiments.                                     The N- and C-terminal split fragments of the firefly luciferase were fused to the                                     C-terminus of the CRY2PHR and the CIBN proteins, since this topology has previously                                     been shown to work with the Cre recombinase.
CRY2PHR/CIBN light inducible receptor fused to split                                             luciferase responded to light efficiently and repeatedly.
(A) Response to light depended on the                                                 amount of the CIBN:cLuc plasmid. After induction the cells transfected with                                                 the CIBN:cLuc and CRY2PHR:nLuc encoding plasmids were lysed and luciferase activity was determined                                                 with the dual luciferase assay.                                                 (B) CRY2PHR light reporter was induced repeatedly. Following the                                                 addition of luciferin to the medium, cells transfected with                                                the CIBN:cLuc and CRY2PHR:nLuc encoding plasmids                                                 (ratio 1:3) were induced with blue light at 460nm and left in the dark for indicated periods.
As luciferase activity was highest with a 1:3 ratio of CRY2PHR:CIBN constructs (
4
A), all subsequent experiments were performed with this ratio. Next we tested if                                     this system could be induced repeatedly in real time. The CRY2PHR/CIBN system showed a                                     maximum activity after 2 minutes of induction and dropped to background 10 minutes                                     after                                     the stimulus was removed. The system could be induced repeatedly and reach high levels of activation at each stimulation (

B).
 Light inducible                                     proteases
To implement light as one of the input signals for protease-based                                     signalling pathways or logic functions, we fused the CRY2PHR and the CIBN domains to                                     the N- and C-terminal                                     split domains of 3 different proteases (TEVp, TEVpE and PPVp) (
5
A). Activity and orthogonality were tested by cleavage of a cyclic luciferase reporter . Cleavage of this reporter results in luciferase reconstitution and thus an increase in luminescence. Both the TEV and the PPV split proteases, coupled to the CRY2PHR/CIBN system, showed high catalytic activity and exquisite mutual orthogonality upon blue light illumination (

B and C).
The CRY2PHR/CIBN mediates reconstitution of orthogonal split proteases upon illumination with blue light
(A) Schematic representation of the CRY2PHR/CIBN light-inducible system with split protease. In the dark, the CRY2PHR and CIBN proteins do not interact (left), while illumination with blue light results in heterodimerization and reconstitution of split protease (right), which in turn cleaves the cyclic luciferase reporter, resulting in increased luciferase activity. HEK293T cells were transfected with 1:3 ratio of plasmids coding for CRY2PHR:CIBN with split TEV (B) or PPV (C) protease. 24 hours after transfection, cells were illuminated with blue light at 460nm for indicated periods of time. The cells were lysed and bioluminescence was measured with dual luciferase assay. Upon illumination with blue light, the protease cleaves only the cyclic reporter with the correct cleavage site (red bars), while the cyclic reporter with the mismatched cleavage site remains uncleaved (white bars).
Blue light-induced reconstitution of split protease mediates substrate cleavage.
(A) In the dark, the CRY2PHR and CIBN proteins do not interact (top), while illumination with blue light results in heterodimerization and reconstitution of split protease (bottom), which in turn cleaves the target protein. Activity of (B) TEV, (C)                                                 PPV and (D) TEV(E) proteases were analyzed by western blot. 24                                                 hours after transfection, cells were illuminated with blue light at 460nm for indicated periods of time. Cells were immediately lysed and the cleaved products were analysed by Western blot using anti-AU1 antibodies.                                                 Excluding the non-specific upper band, uncleaved samples show only one                                                 band, while the                                                 cleaved ones show two bands.
The reporter used for the western blot analysis was the luciferase                                     reporter with the appropriate cleavage substrate inserted at a permissible site and                                     the AU1 tag at                                     the N-terminus. Uncleaved luciferase appears as a single band on a western blot, partially cleaved luciferase would result in two bands (uncleaved at 65 kDa and                                     cleaved                                     at 55 kDa), while complete cleavage would result in only the smaller band. Our results indicate that substrates carrying specific protease cleavage sites were cleaved after blue light illumination of cells harboring plasmids for expression of CRY2PHR:nTEV and CIBN:cTEV proteins (
6
).
Both methods confirmed successful, fast and dose-dependent                                     responses. This is the first time TEVpE and PPVp were prepared as split proteins and shown                                     to function in an inducible system.
