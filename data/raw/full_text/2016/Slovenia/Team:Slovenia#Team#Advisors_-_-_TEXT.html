Roman the Great, the First of His Name, Khal of the Wide White Lab, the          King Beyond the Sliding Door, Bender of Coiled Coils and Master of the          Logic Operations
Roman Jerala
Field of research:
Synthetic Biology, Bio-nanostructures, Innate Immunity
Main contributions:
Enabling everybody to get the best out of him/her
Science crush:
Designing molecules and cells, whatever is exciting and unorthodox.
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
Nowadays, I don't have much time to be in the lab anyway :-(
Mojca Benčina
Field of study:
Biochemistry, Immunology, Synthetic Biology, Molecular Biology
Main contributions:
Supervising everybody on everything with emphasis on calcium signaling and microscopy
The Hand of the King
Science crush:
Calcium signaling with mistresses immunology and synthetic biology
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
Cross-country skiing
She drinks(redbull) and she knows things.
Tina Lebar
Field of study:
MSc Microbiology, currently a PhD candidate in the field of synthetic biology
Main contributions:
Mentoring mechanosensing, calcium sensing and light sensing
Science crush:
My first love is mammalian synthetic biology. I`m inexplicably attracted to the wonderful world of transcriptional regulation, especially designable transcription factors such as TALEs and dCas9. Other than that, I`m interested in genome editing, bionanotechnology and metabolic engineering. Lately I`ve also been flirting with computational biology.
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
Obsessively thinking about all the experiments I could be doing right now in the lab.
Tina Fink
Field of study:
Biochemistry and Molecular biology
Main contributions:
Mentoring​ ​work with split proteases and ER secretion
The Master of Whisperers
Science crush:
You call it science crush, I call it a job.
There's no justice in this world, not unless we make it.
Jan Lonzarić
Field of study:
Biochemistry and Molecular biology
Main contributions:
Mentoring the work with split proteases and ER secretion
Science crush:
Patterns. Finding them, understanding how it all fits together, and then changing it and making new stuff from words, numbers, paper or molecules.
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
Trying to impress someone with awesome facts about biology or linguistics, advocating social justice, or maybe just dancing a jig or a reel.
Maja Meško
Field of study:
Molecular biology
Main contributions:
Mentoring the work with ultrasound system, supplying enzymes and food.
Tomorrow, I am going to be chasing cats…
Science crush:
The infinite universe of synthetic biology
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
Eating in the office or eating somewhere in the mountains.
Someone has to train them.
Fabio Lapenta
Field of study:
Biochemistry, Microbiology
Main contributions:
Mentoring the work with coiled coils
Science crush:
Protein and protein proteins
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
In the office.
Žiga Strmšek
Field of study:
Biotechnology, Microbiology, Industrial pharmacy
Main contributions:
Mentoring, (trying to) keep up the morale
Every one of us is poor and powerless.
Science crush:
Anything challenging that requires integration of knowledge and crazy ideas
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
Taking a corner in my car, engine screaming, wind in my beard. Or fencing. Or working on my car.
  The House of Advisors
You see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those who are advisors and those who dig. You dig.
Miha Mraz
Field of research:
Unconventional Computing, Computational Biology, Synthetic Biology
Main contributions:
Making decent interdisciplinary human beings, who are able to serve even a life-science team, out of computer science geeks.
Science crush:
... programmable life is here  ...
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
On a snow groomer as a driver.
Miha Moškon
Field of study:
Computational biology
Main contributions:
Advising the computational part of the team.
Never forget you are merely a computer scientist. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you.
Science crush:
Creating life in silico.
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
On my bike.
Across the world footprints go,
across the world tracks through snow.
God knows who came before me,
god knows who after me will go...
Dejan Križaj
Field of study:
Electrical engineering
Main contributions:
Design and development of a device for generation and amplification of ultrasonic pulses and ultrasound physics with measurements and analysis of ultrasonic pulses
​
Science crush:​
Scratching cells with electromagnetic field
If I weren't in the lab I would be:
In the woods, mountains, on a bicycle, surf …
