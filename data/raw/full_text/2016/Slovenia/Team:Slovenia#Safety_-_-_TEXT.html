Department of synthetic biology and immunology of the National Institute of Chemistry (NIC) where we did the experimental work is classified as Biosafety level 1.           All of the bacterial and mammalian cell lines we were working with (DH5alpha, TOP10, NiCo21(DE3)pLysS, HEK293, HEK293T, neuro-2A) belong to risk group 1, which means they do not cause disease in healthy adult humans and therefore pose minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel. The same goes for all the organisms from which           our parts originate.
For handling the biological material different work areas with different safety requirements were used.  Work with bacteria took place mostly in general, open          bench lab. Standard safety precautions were followed: work area was cleaned with 70% ethanol before and after work, safety equipment, including long pants, close-toed           shoes, lab coats and gloves were worn at all times, all GMO waste was deactivated and properly discarded, the lab was physically separated from the rest of the building          to prevent the spread of GMOs and those were carried around only in specified closed containers. Most of the work was completed in sterile conditions. In other           work areas the same safety precautions were followed and additional ones if needed. All dangerous chemicals (TEMED, acrylamide, organic solvents, beta-mercaptoethanolâ€¦)          were handled in chemical fume hoods. For work with ethidium bromide we had a designated gel electrophoresis lab with specific safety rules. The lab had separate           ''clean'' and ''contaminated'' areas. No material that had been in the ''contaminated'' area was to be taken out of that lab. Stronger nitrile gloves had to be worn           all the time and the lab had designated equipment that could not be taken outside.  Mammalian cells were handled in a designated cell lab with laminar flow hoods, where          special equipment (including specific lab coats, hairnets and disposable shoe covers) had to be worn.
All members of our team who performed experiments have extensive wet lab experience and were trained and tested in lab safety, both general and GMO specific.           General safety training was provided by the head of Work safety service of NIC and the person responsible for keeping and           implementation of containment measures for our laboratory. Training in GMO safety was provided by the commissioner for biosafety at NIC.  Furthermore, each           member of the team received one-on-one practical training before working in designated areas (such as proper safety precautions when working in the cell lab           or in agarose gel electrophoresis lab).
The safety guidelines concerning GMOs in our lab are in accordance with European and Slovenian legislature with additional amendments .
