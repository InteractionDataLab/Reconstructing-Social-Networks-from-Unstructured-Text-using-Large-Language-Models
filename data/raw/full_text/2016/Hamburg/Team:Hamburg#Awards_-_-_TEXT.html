The Jamboree was a blast, we had so much fun, met and talked to so many of you awesome crazy people and made a lot of new friends.                         That alone would have been more than enough for us, but you decided to reward us with the iGEMer's Prize and turned our Jamboree into an unforgettable experience.                         Thank you so much.
