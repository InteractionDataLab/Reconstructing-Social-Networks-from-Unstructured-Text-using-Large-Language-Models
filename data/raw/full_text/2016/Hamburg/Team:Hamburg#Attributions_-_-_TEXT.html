Zoya Ignatova
Zoya Ignatova was our primary Principal Investigator. She is professor for biochemistry at the University of Hamburg and specified in RNA biochemistry,                                         in particular on tRNAs. She not only provided us the laboratories and equipment, but also helped with troubleshooting and through teaching us about translation profiled optimization, which we greatly needed for our experiments. While she advised us on all levels of the project, she also gave us a free hand in developing and executing our ideas. Without Professor Ignatovas great engagement for building up an iGEM team at our university we would never had the chance to realize such an extensive and ambitious project already in the second year of participation.
Frauke Adamla
Frauke was our secondary Principal Investigator. She was always helpful and supported us with her lab experience every time we were confronted with problems and uncertainties. Thanks to her dedicated way to advise us, even members without any laboratory experience were able to adapt quickly.                                         She furthermore supported us with organizing our experiments and our laboratory equipment. After one year of minor and major experimental and personal dramas Frauke is not only our secondary PI, she is a part of our team.
Henning Jacobsen
Henning ist the Advisor of our Team. He was the team leader of the first iGEM Team of the University of Hamburg (Flu Fighters in 2015). He advised us how to plan a project, helped to find our sponsors and provided us with his wide network. All team members profited a lot by his lab knowledge and for our team leaders he was an enormous help in terms of staff management. Day and night he was available for questions and problems. Although he is not a regular team member and did not work in the lab physically: he is our lab hero!

The University of Hamburg
Sponsors
We would like to thank all of our sponsors for their support and valuable input for our project. Without their help this project would have never grown and gone this far. You can read about each sponsor in the following:
University of Hamburg
“Universität Hamburg is the largest institution for research and education in the north of Germany. As one of the country's largest universities, it offers a diverse course spectrum and excellent research opportunities.The University boasts numerous interdisciplinary projects in a broad range of subjects and an extensive partner network with leading institutions on a regional, national and international scale.”
- uni-hamburg.de
We thank the University of Hamburg for making our journey to Boston possible.
Synenergene
We would like to thank Synenergene for their tremendous support for our Human Practices project. Synenergene intends to make major contributions to synthetic biology responsible research and innovation, on the basis of public participation and mutual learning among a wide variety of stakeholders from science, industry, civil society, education, art, and other fields.
As part of the collaboration and grant agreement we were able to carry out a Human Practices Project that we have never dreamed of being possible. You can read about the success we were able to achieve on our Human Practices site. Without the help of Synenergene, such a Project could have never been completed or even attempted.
Alumni Association University Hambug
“The purpose of our Association is to promote research, teaching and education. Our driving force is our enthusiasm for our cause. We want to promote students, connect alumni and promote international exchange. We want to build bridges between theoretical research and practice as well as between Hamburg and the world.”
- alumni-uhh.de
The Alumni Association helped us throughout our entire project, not only financially but also gave us valuable input from the perspective of non-scientists. We thank the Alumni Association and thereby every member of it for supporting our project.
