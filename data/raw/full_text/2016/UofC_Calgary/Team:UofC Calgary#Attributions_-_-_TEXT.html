He was familiar in many of the different parts of our project and provided coaching to the various subgroups working on different objectives. He also used his experience in mass spectroscopy to help us with quantifying mBBI in two important assays of our project. He helped us determine the concentration of mBBI in mouse blood (in vivo testing) and the levels of mBBI secretion from the genetically engineered chassis, Bacillus subtilis.
Nicholas Jette
Nicholas was a Teaching Assistant for the team. He was a great aid in the execution of the assays that we wished to run to characterize mBBI. He trained members of the team in tissue culture and conducting clonogenic assays.
Rai Chaudhuri
Rai, as an Advisor, assisted the team with troubleshooting chassis (B. subtilis) experiments. As well, she provided mentorship for the Human Practices aspect of the project by editing our Policy Brief, suggesting ideas for outreach, and collaborations with other teams.
Ainna Randhawa
Ainna provided mentorship in the development of the chassis and Human Practices aspects of the project. Her artwork was used in some of our outreach efforts, such as the Adults Only Night: Hack It with TELUS Spark.
Technical Support:
Chassis:
Dr. Sui-Lam Wong
Dr. Wong provided the team with protocols for various types of growth media such as super rich medium, sporulation medium, and 2X SG medium. He also provided us with protocols for inducing the competency of B. subtilis and how to prepare effective glycerol stocks. Most importantly, Dr. Wong kindly provided us with B. subtilis WB800 cells to work with for our project.
Dennis Kim
Dennis assisted the team in troubleshooting for comK gene transformations and integration into B. subtilis.
Nic Sieben
Nic provided the team with our plasmid extraction protocol that we used to perform most of our minipreps.
Biotarget:
Dr. Susan Lees-Miller
Dr. Lees-Miller's lab kindly donated the mammalian cell line HCT116 that our team used. She also provided a few members of the team with access to her gamma cell irradiator, both of which were a great help to us in characterizing mBBI.

Dr. Aaron Goodarzi helped conceptualize our project by introducing the team to soybean-derived radioprotective peptides. He helped us brainstorm the list of experiments we needed to conduct in order to characterize mBBI. Dr. Goodarzi also kindly donated the primary fibroblast cell line 1BR3 to us and trained members of the team in conducting H2AX foci assays. He was critical to the process of characterization of mBBI.
Dr. Hans Vogel and Dr. Elke Lohmeier Vogel
They provided the team with dialysis membranes with a cut off of 6 and 20 kDa. Also, Dr. Elke Vogel mentored the team with regards to the chassis system, possible modifications of BBI that can optimize delivery, and the creation of small scale bioreactor within a patch.

Karolin Klement
Karolin helped us with the execution of the clonogenics assay and provided us with advice when we switched our cell lines from HCT116 to 1BR3. Since primary cell lines have different requirements than cancer cells, she showed members of the team the requirements to run a clonogenic assay with 1BR3 cell line.

Dr. Sundararaj offered technical support with the development of the patch prototype by providing us with insights on thermoforming and properties of polymers, and how we could incorporate these methods for small scale production of our product.
Robert Mayall
Robert offered counselling on our size-controlling permeable membrane experiment and suggested alternative materials that we could use for our delivery system.
Tylor Walsh
Tylor offered counselling on our size-controlling permeable membrane, similar to Robert Mayall. Tylor specifically provided us with opinions on alternative size-controlling membranes that are used in industry to filter peptides and other small molecules.
Dr. Justin MacCallum
Dr. MacCallum mentored members of the team on molecular simulations of mBBI delivery through a lipid bilayer to simulate its transit through the layers of the skin.

in vivo Testing:
Dr. Craig Jenne and Members of the Jenne Lab
Dr. Jenne has a license to work with mice models for scientific purposes. He assisted the team by submitting the ethics approval for in vivo testing of our patch, mBBI, and B. subtilis in three mice models. Members of the team filled out the ethics application but it was submitted under Dr. Jenne's name. Once ethics approval had been received, Dr. Jenne kindly donated 18 BALB/c mice for testing. Rachelle Davis (Graduate Student) and Mandy Tse (Lab Manager) handled all mice (adhering patches, regular check up on mice health and behaviour, blood extraction, and euthanization). Dr. Seok-Joo Kim (Post-Doctoral Fellow), Rachelle Davis, and Dr. Jenne performed mice tissue analyses (tissue fixing, immunohistochemical staining, and imaging).
