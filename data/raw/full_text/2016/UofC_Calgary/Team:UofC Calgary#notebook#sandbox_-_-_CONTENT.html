Sketch the 1 x 1 cm square on the liner at the center of the area</SPAN></LI><LI class="c38 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">Trim the laminate to roughly 1.5 x 1.5 cm</SPAN></LI><LI class="c38 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">Lay the laminate membrane-side up on the iron board, and the backing layer on top</SPAN></LI><LI class="c38 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">Iron 1 side of the patch up to the sketch. To make the seal even and bubble free, when sealing, apply more pressure on the side of the iron that’s touching the line, then tilt the iron so that side of the iron lifts up slightly, then press it down again, after each time, move the iron away from the line to the edge of the patch. The seal should look clearer than the center. If not, then the iron is not hot enough, redo using a different side of the iron until it’s clear</SPAN></LI><LI class="c38 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">Seal the other 3 edges. Now the patch should be stuck to the iron board, leave it there. Repeat the process for another 2 patches.</SPAN></LI><LI class="c38 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">Remove the first patch from the iron board. Prevent peeling the patch off the liner by sliding a finger under the patch after you peel off 1 corner when you reach the liner.</SPAN></LI><LI class="c38 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">Hold the patch diagonally, vertically, backing-side facing you. Bend it slightly so the backing folds towards you. The backing at the center (not sealed) should bend and separate from the membrane, creating a thin pocket running diagonally from the top corner to the bottom corner.</SPAN></LI><LI class="c38 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">Fill the syringe with water, use the needle to poke a hole at the top corner of the patch, make sure the needle did not poke anywhere else and the needle is in deeper than half of the patch.</SPAN></LI><LI class="c38 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">Inject the water slowly, keep a bend in the patch so we have a pocket, fill it from the bottom corner, tilt the needle and the patch to get the other 2 corners, then fill it nearly to the top corner. A good volume should be 0.06 - 0.08 mL</SPAN></LI><LI class="c38 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">Remove the needle straight out, a drop of water may leak out, dry it lightly with paper towel, don’t push on it</SPAN></LI><LI class="c38 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">Lay it on the iron board. Make sure there’s no water droplet visible. If there is, dry it gently with a paper towel, then iron on the hole for about 1-2 seconds</SPAN></LI><LI class="c38 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">Press on the patch slightly to see if there’s still any leaks, if yes, dry the droplet of water with paper towel and re-iron the corner until there’s no more leaks.</SPAN></LI><LI class="c38 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">Now the patch is done, trim the sealed sides with scissors to approximately half of the original side dimensions. Round off the sharp corners</SPAN></LI><LI class="c38 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">Cut a bandage in half, horizontally, then cut it vertically to create 2 small rectangles, with the sides approximately to be twice of the sealed sides of the patch </SPAN></LI><LI class="c38 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">To put the patch on a finger, remove the liner, put it on and press all edges lightly but firmly until all edges stay down</SPAN></LI><LI class="c38 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">To reinforce the patch, put the 2 bandage pieces on both sides that go down to the sides of the finger </SPAN></LI></OL><P class="c44 c33 c42"><SPAN class="c27 c25 c20">*Note:</SPAN><SPAN class="c25 c20"> A patch with “YES” written on it is on the iron board. It should show you the size of the patch, how clear the seals get, and how I seal the hole. You can ask Tiffany about the process of applying since she had 5 on her fingers today.</SPAN></P><P class="c44 c33 c42"><SPAN class="c27 c25 c20">*Note 2: </SPAN><SPAN class="c25 c20">This is a pretty reliable method. The seal works great most of the time. Poking more than 1 hole in the patch happens once in awhile. The patch stays on well most of the time. The water will leak when you put on if the seal is not good enough, or if there’s another hole you accidentally poked.</SPAN></P><H3 class="c11" id="h.h3fuz11zfuth"><SPAN>Wednesday, August 31st</SPAN></H3><UL class="c2 lst-kix_1qgee6j7obt0-0 start"><LI class="c15 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">David made some more mice patches for Thursday</SPAN></LI></UL><H3 class="c11" id="h.n0v42itdw701"><SPAN>Thursday, September 1st</SPAN></H3><UL class="c2 lst-kix_61pipssxjd5z-0 start"><LI class="c15 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">David put 3 patches of different shapes (square, rectangle, and triangle) on the mice in Dr. Jenne’s lab and reinforced them with tissue glue.</SPAN></LI></UL><H3 class="c11" id="h.5doz1h9godgl"><SPAN>Friday, September 2nd</SPAN></H3><UL class="c2 lst-kix_6ppt4s25kk1y-0 start"><LI class="c15 c33"><SPAN class="c25 c20">All 3 patches from yesterday survived.
