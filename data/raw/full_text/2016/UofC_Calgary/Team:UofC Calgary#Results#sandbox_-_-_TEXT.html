Our entire                                                 team received a full BioSafety                                                 education from the University                                                 of Calgary! This entailed going                                                 to classes to prepare for a                                                 final quiz that tested our                                                 ability to be safe in the lab.                                                 Several of our members also had                                                 radiation training and                                                 clearance to ensure that work                                                 done with radiation was                                                 safe!
