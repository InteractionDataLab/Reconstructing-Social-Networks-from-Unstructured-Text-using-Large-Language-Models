Problem
Mankind is on the verge of travelling to our closest planetary neighbor; Mars. However, a variety of problems are glaring obstacles to this feat of human achievement. Deadly cosmic radiation is the foremost problems among these. Ionizing radiation cleaves cellular DNA through the phosphate backbone, causing the cell to mutate or apoptose. Without guards against this damaging agent, mankind will forever be destined to stay within our stellar home of Earth.
