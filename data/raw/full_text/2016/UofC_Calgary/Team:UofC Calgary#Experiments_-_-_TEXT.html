Double-Stranded Break Assay using Immunofluorescence
Experimental Details
and Rationale
Exposure to ionizing radiation causes DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in cells, which are naturally repaired by cells over time. DSBs in nuclear DNA can be visualized in cells by immunofluorescence staining of DSB markers – namely 53BP1, a protein which binds near DSBs. As a result, nuclear foci form, each corresponding to a DSB. Over time, the number of foci are reduced due to DNA repair. To test for radioprotection by mBBI, we wanted to study the repair kinetics in cells treated with mBBI against a control.
Cells were grown to confluency, irradiated and fixed at various time points over 24 hours. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to visualize 53BP1 and the resulting foci were counted.
Materials
Glass coverslips and microscopy slides
1BR3 primary fibroblast cells in Modified Eagle Medium (MEM) - (10^5 cells/ml)
30 mm Cell Culture Plates
1x PBS
1x PBS solution with 3% PFA (w/v) and 2% (w/v) sucrose
1x PBS solution with 2% (w/v) Bovine Serum Albumin
1x PBS solution with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X100
1x PBS solution with 0.1μg/ml 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
Mouse anti-53BP1 Antibody
Rabbit anti-H2AX Antibody
Cy3 anti-Mouse Antibody
FITC anti-Rabbit Antibody
Mounting medium for fluorescence (Flouromount G or Vectashield)
Protocol
Prep and Irradiation
Plate 2 mLs of 1BR3 cells at the density of 10^5 cells/ml MEM into 22 30 mm plates containing glass coverslips. Incubate cells until 100% confluency is observed on the glass coverslips using a brightfield microscope.
Treat the confluent plates with mBBI (as outlined in Table 1) and incubate at 37℃ with 5% CO for 6 hours.
Irradiate plates which are intended for irradiation (outlined in Table 1) with 2 Gy. We used a Gammacell 1000 irradiator (MDS Nordion).
Immunofluorescence Staining
When plates reach their intended time point, remove the media and wash in 1X PBS. Perform washes by pouring PBS into the dish beside the coverslip, with special care not to pour media directly onto the coverslips, which could dislodge the cells. All washes hereon are done in this manner.
Cells on glass coverslips are fixed for 10 minutes by adding 100 mL of 1X PBS solution with 3% PFA (w/v) and 2% sucrose (w/v) to the top of the coverslip, forming a dome on the coverslip.
Wash cells twice in 1X PBS and store in 1X PBS until all plates have been fixed at their corresponding time points.
Add 100 mL of 1X PBS solution with 0.2% Triton X100 (v/v) to the cells for 3 minutes to allow permeabilization.
Incubate cells in 100 mL of a 1:800 dilution of Mouse anti-53BP1 and Rabbit anti-H2AX in 2% BSA for 1 hour. Pipet the solution dropwise onto the coverslips.
Wash cells three times in 1X PBS. 100 μl of secondary antibodies Cy3 anti-Mouse and FITC anti-Rabbit pipetting dropwise onto the coverslips. Cells are incubated in this solution for 20 minutes in the dark, because FITC and Cy3 are sensitive to light and lose their fluorescence if prematurely exposed.
Wash cells 3 times in 1X PBS.
Pour 2 mls of 1X PBS containing 0.1 mg/mL DAPI into the  dishes and leave on for 10 mins.
Wash cells 3 times in 1X PBS.
Microscopy slides were prepared by adding one drop of Vectashield onto the slide.
Carefully lift coverslips from the cell culture dishes using a razor blade or sharp edged inplement and plate onto microscopy slides such that the cell bed (top of the coverslip) is placed face down on the slide.
Seal the edges of the coverslip onto the slide by brushing on clear nail polish over the edges.
Counting Foci
Randomize cells by using opaque tape to cover their labels and get them randomly assorted by another lab member. Number them on the tape for ease of reference when counting.
Foci can be counted on an epifluorescent microscope under red and green channels.
Table 1: Experimental Outline of mBBI treatment and Ionizing Radiation. mBBI treatment was administered at 30uM and cells were irradiated at 2 Gy.
Clonogenic Cell Survival Assay
Experimental Details
and Rationale
Ionizing radiation is capable of killing cells by damaging their DNA, causing single and double strand breaks, which trigger apoptosis. If the DNA damage can be repaired, the cells survive. If not, they will die. To test whether mBBI elicits radioprotection, the survival of cells can be assessed. The purpose of this assay is to assess the viability of cells when treated  with ionizing radiation, with and without mBBI.
Materials
MEM media with 15% Fetal Bovine Serum (v/v) and 10% Penicillin-Streptomycin (v/v)
T-75 flasks
60 mm Cell culture plates
1BR3 cells
Trypan Blue Dye
0.25% Trypsin EDTA
15ml Centrifuge Tube
Protocol
Preparation of Cell Lines Prior to Setting up Clonogenic Cell Survival
Label 6 T-75 flasks with a known number of cells and radiation in Gy (0 and 5). Add 5 ml of growth medium to the flasks and keep them in a biosafety hood.
Trypsinize the stock flask of cells to be tested for radiosensitivity.
Obtain a cell count, then add 250,000 cells to the 5ml medium in the T-75 flask.
Place T-75 flasks with the cell cultures in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2, and keep cap to the flask loose to allow gas exchange.
Allow the cells to settle and attach as a monolayer.
Irradiation of Flasks and Performance of Plating Experiment for Clonogenic Assay
Label all 60 mm plates according to cell line, drug and radiation exposure.
Place 5mL of complete medium in each plate
Label all 15 ml tubes according to 1:1, 1:10, 1:100 for each Gy dose level (0 and 5).
Put 4.5 ml of complete medium into the 1:10 and 1:100 tubes, but not the 1:1 tubes.
Ensure that the Coulter counter is set to the appropriate size parameter for the cell line.
Irradiate the flasks at the appropriate dose.
Starting with the 0 Gy flask, aspirate the medium and then rinse the cells with PBS, then trypsinize.
Place these harvested cells in the 15ml tube labelled as 0 Gy, 1:1. Take 100 ul of the 0 Gy, 1:1 solution and place in the counting vial for 0 Gy. Now aspirate, rinse cells with PBS and trypsinize the next flask, 5 Gy. While the 5 Gy flask is  on the warming tray, count the 0 Gy counting tray using the Coulter counter and record this data.
As before, place the harvested 5 Gy cells into the 15 ml tube labelled 5 Gy, 1:1. Take 100 ul of the 5 Gy 1:1 solution and put into the 5 Gy counting vial. Use a Coulter counter to count cells as before.
Serial Dilutions and Incubation
Resuspend the cell pellet of the 15 ml tube.
Place 0.5 ml of the 1:1 dilution into the 1:10 dilution tubes of both the 0 Gy and 5 Gy tubes.
Calculate the volume of the cell solution needed to plate ~50-100 cells.
Place this volume of the appropriate dilution (probably 1:100) onto the appropriate 60 mm plate. Spread this medium drop by drop, ensuring that the plate is covered equally. You can shake the plate to distribute the culture evenly, but do not swirl. Only back-and-forth motions.
Place all plates into the incubator. Incubate for 14 days at 37C with 5% CO2.
Staining of Plates
Take out all plates from the incubator and aspirate media with vacuum
Add 1mL fixing solution to each of the plates (3% acetic acid, 8% methanol, 89% dH2O)
Allow cells to sit in fix solution for 2 minutes, then aspirate fix solution
Add 1mL stain solution to each of the plates (0.2% (w/v) Gentian violet, 10% formalin in PBS)
Let plates sit in stain solution for 5 minutes and aspirate stain solution
Add dH2O at room temperature to the plates to de-stain excess Gentian Violet. Repeat twice, or until only the colonies are stained as opposed to the plate.
Let the plates air-dry overnight. Count the next day.
Counting of Colonies
Take the air-dried plates and place in ColCount machine after blanking the machine. Count using small colony reference program and record data in a table.
Calculate plating efficiency (PE) by finding the average colony counts for the 3 plates and dividing that by the number of cells plated, then multiply by 100%. ((Ave colonies counted / Number of cells plated) X 100 %).
To find the the surviving fraction (SF), take the PE of the treated sample and divide that by the PE of the control, then multiply by 100%. ((PE treated / PE control) X 100%)

DEVICE
Semipermeable Membrane Diffusion Assay
Experimental Details
and Rationale
The purpose of this assay was to determine quantitatively if the membrane in our transdermal patch can act as a filter and prevent bacteria cells from diffusing through the semipermeable membrane.
Materials
50 mL falcon tubes
15 mL falcon tubes
Distilled/non distilled water
NaCl
20 mL overnight culture (B. subtilis WB800)
LB media
CoTran 9716 and 9728 semipermeable membrane
Parafilm
Protocol
Preparation
Prepare 500 mL of 0.9% w/v saline solution using sodium chloride at a pH of 7.35. Cover using parafilm and store at room temperature.
Start 20 mL overnight culture B. subtilis.
For the first replicate of the assay, first determine the wavelength needed to detect cells in the distilled water. Start 5 mL overnight culture of B. subtilis.
Using distilled water as a blank, using a spectro scan spike the blank with LB media and determine a peak from the spike.
Repeat process using cell culture in distilled water.
Using the wavelength peak from the spectro scan, use this wavelength for the remainder of the assay.
As our spectrophotometer did not have the capabilities to do a gradient scan, we used known wavelengths to determine what wavelength best detected cells. This was done by running a preliminary diffusion assay, set up exactly like the one described in the setup. Readings at 260 nm, 300 nm, 600 nm and 700 nm were done after 24 hours. 260 nm, 300 nm and 600 nm of wavelengths were used based on the readings we got.
Measurements
Aliquot 5 mL of each overnight culture into three 15 mL falcon tubes.
With one of the 15 mL falcon tube wrap parafilm over the top of the tube.
With the other, place the 9716 semipermeable membrane over the top of the tube and Parafilm around the edges to prevent it from falling off. Repeat using 9728 semipermeable membrane
With the 50 mL falcon tubes, add 30 mL of saline solution
Invert and submerse the 15 mL falcon tubes into the 50 mL falcon tubes. Cover the top of the 50 mL falcon tube with Parafilm.
After a 24 hour period take a 1 mL sample of the water in the 50 mL falcon tube.
Using saline solution as a blank, spec the sample at 260 nm, 300 nm, and 600 nm.
Repeat once daily for seven days.
Filter Sterilization Membrane Diffusion Assay
Experimental Details
and Rationale
In running the first diffusion assay, our data analysis showed that there was an increased amount of cell detection, meaning that the cells may or may not be diffusing through. However, we suspected that there might be contamination so we repeated the assay with a few changes.
This time, we are using a filter sterilization membrane that has pore sizes of 0.2 micron. We are also adding hygromycin to the saline solution for B. subtilis WB800 and chloramphenicol for E.coli mBBI-GFP. This ensured that there would be no contamination in our samples.
Materials
10 mL syringes
Filter sterilization membrane
Distilled/non distilled water
NaCl
Hygromycin (20 mg/mL)
20 mL overnight culture (B. subtilis WB800)
LB media
250 mL erlenmeyer flasks
Chloramphenicol agar plates
Protocol
Preparation
Prepare 500 mL of 0.9% W/V saline solution using sodium chloride at a pH of 7.35. Add appropriate antibiotics. Cover using parafilm and store at room temperature.
Start 20 mL overnight culture B. subtilis.
For the first replicate of the assay, first determine the wavelength needed to detect cells in the distilled water. Start 5 mL overnight culture of B. subtilis.
Using distilled water as a blank, using a spectro scan spike the blank with LB media and determine a peak from the spike.

This was done by running a preliminary diffusion assay, set up exactly like the one described in the setup. Readings at 260 nm, 300 nm, 600 nm and 700 nm were done after 24 hours. 260 nm, 300 nm and 600 nm of wavelengths were used based on the readings we got.
Measurements
Take up 5 mL of each overnight culture into two 10 mL syringes. Take up 5 mL chloramphenicol LB media into one 10 mL syringe. Attach filter sterilization membrane to one of the syringes containing the 5 mL overnight culture and to the syringe containing 5 mL chlor + LB media.
With the 250 mL erlenmeyer flasks, add 10 mL of saline solution.
Submerse each of the 10 mL filter sterilization syringes into the 250 mL erlenmeyer flasks. Cover the top of the erlenmeyer flasks with Parafilm.
After a 24-hour period take a 1 mL sample of the saline solution in the 250 mL erlenmeyer flasks.
Using saline solution as a blank, spec the sample at 260 nm, 300 nm, and 600 nm.
Take a 150 µL sample of the saline solution and plate it on respective antibiotic plate.

Backing Layer Growth Curve Assay
Experimental Details
and Rationale
The purpose of this assay was to determine quantitatively if the backing layer will allow cell growth similar to those found under optimal conditions.
Materials
10 mL culture tube
CoTran 9722 backing layer
50 mL falcon tubes
LB media with hygromycin
Hygromycin agar plates
Protocol
Preparation of B. subtilis WB800 Cells
Two days prior to measuring growth, prepare an overnight culture of B. subtilis in 10 mL LB broth with the appropriate antibiotic (100 μg/mL final concentration of hygromycin). Incubate at 37°C, shaking at 200 rpm overnight.
Inoculation
One day prior to measuring growth, inoculate 9 mL LB broth in a 50 mL Falcon tube with 1 mL of overnight culture at 16:40 (Tube 7), 16:45 (Tube 8) and 16:50 (Tube 9). Incubate the inoculated tubes at desired temperature (35°C, 22°C or 4°C) with lids loosened, shaking at 200 rpm.
Repeat Step 2 at 00:20 (Tube 4), 00:25 (Tube 5), and 00:30 (Tube 6) on the same day of growth measurement.
Repeat Step 2 at 8:00 (Tube 1), 8:05 (Tube 2), and 8:10 (Tube 3) on the same day of growth measurement.
Measurement of Growth
Set the wavelength of the spectrophotometer to a wavelength 600 nm (OD600). Blank the spectrophotometer with 1 mL uninoculated LB broth in a cuvette, making sure to only blank once!
Commence measurement of samples at 8:00 (OD600). For 8 hours, measure Tube 1 every hour at :00, Tube 2 every hour at :05, Tube 3 every hour at :10, Tube 4 every hour at :20, Tube 5 every hour at :25, Tube 6 every hour at :30, Tube 7 every hour at :40, Tube 8 every hour at :45, and Tube 9 every hour at :50.
To measure, add 1 mL of sample to a cuvette, wipe down sides with a Kim-wipe, and insert into spectrophotometer. Record value. If samples reach an OD600 >0.4, dilute the sample 10X using LB-broth with 100 μg/mL hygromycin. Account for this dilution factor when recording values (multiple reading by 10). After each measurement, return the culture to its appropriate incubation temperature with lids loosened, shaking at 200 rpm.
Backing Layer Survival Assay
Experimental Details
and Rationale
Following the first backing layer growth curve assay, we consulted our mentors and determined that the assay was not effective in determining whether our backing layer would be a limiting factor for gas exchange. This is due to the fact that there is 10x the volume of oxygen in the culture tube to begin with. Therefore, the rate of gas exchange through the backing layer will be negligible.
This purpose of this assay was to determine whether the bacterial cells can be starved of oxygen with our backing layer using a different protocol.
Materials
10 mL culture tube
2x2 well nuclon plates
CoTran 9722 backing layer
CoTran 9719 backing layer
Parafilm
Protocol

Using sterilized 2x2 culture plates, add 1.62 mL of LB media + appropriate antibiotic.
Add 180 µL O/N culture that has already been OD600. This will be the baseline reading.
Pipette 180 µL of the mixture out, discard.
Place appropriate backing layer on top of the culture plates. Secure backing layer with Parafilm on top criss cross and gain around the edges.
For a positive control, cover culture plate with Parafilm. Puncture a hole into each of the wells using a syringe needle.
For a negative control, place the lid on top and Parafilm to secure.
Place in incubator at 35°C at 10 rpm.
Repeat for replicates.

Take the reading of the day one plates.
Repeat for all membranes and controls
Day Three
Repeat day one procedure using day three plates
Day Seven
Repeat day one procedure using day seven plates
in vivo Mouse Testing
Ethics
With the tireless support of Dr. Craig Jenne, the team wrote and submitted an extensive ethics application to the Health Sciences Animal Care Committee (HSACC) which evaluated the application on multiple grounds such as feasibility, morality, precautions, etc. of the testing of our transdermal patch on mice models. Our protocols and the scientific significance of our transdermal patch were reviewed and approved by the HSACC.
Experimental Details
and Rationale
This experiment allowed us to examine the effects of the prototype version of our transdermal patch in vivo. This experiment addresses three main aims:
To determine whether patches containing TD1 tagged mBBI diffused from the patch into systemic circulation of mice.
To determine whether the membrane of the patch was capable of containing B. subtilis without leakage.
To determine whether the adhesive, the peptide or the B. subtilis is immunogenic.
Three cohorts of six mice each were used for this experiment. The first cohort was given patches containing water to examine the effects of the adhesive on the skin. In the second cohort, mice were given a patch containing B. subtilis. The third group was used to examine the diffusion of fusion protein across the skin. In order to measure the effects of these patches, the skin samples were obtained post-euthanasia and tested for any immunological responses (ie. neutrophil deposition). The blood samples were collected to check for mBBI presence using mass spectrometry. The blood samples collected were either isolated for serum or for plasma. Since it was unknown where mBBI would be found, both procedures were conducted.
Materials
18 BALB/c adult mice
18 transdermal patches with respective contents
General Anesthesia
Hair removal cream
0.5 M EDTA
Protocol
Prepare patches with their respective contents in the protocol described here. Manufacture at least 6 working patches of each type.
Use 6 mice for treatment, one for each patch type.
Anesthetize mice with 300 uL of general anesthesia. The anesthesia was administered to 6 mice at a time.e.
Remove hair using hair removal cream (Nair) underneath the shoulder of the mice.
Apply one patch to one mouse on the top of lumbar vertebrae using tissue glue to ensure proper attachment. After the application, leave mice caged.
Repeat Steps 3-5 for other mice in other patch groups.
Keep mice under constant observation to ensure that patch stays on.
After day 2, anesthetize three mice with 600uL of general anesthesia each. (Note: This amount of anesthesia is used when the mice will be sacrificed in the immediate future.)
Once they are unconscious, draw blood samples two of the mice via the left ventricle to obtain blood. Leave the blood sample at room temperature for half an hour, and upon coagulation, isolate serum by centrifugation.
Anesthetize the remaining mouse and collect samples using 8 uL EDTA in order to obtain blood plasma. Once the blood is mixed with the anticoagulant, the plasma is isolated by spinning down the sample.
Sacrifice the mice via cervical dislocation. Obtain skin samples from the lumbar region.
At day 5, repeat Steps 8-11.

Inject extracted samples onto a 10 cm C18 column and elute with a 30 minute 5-40%B gradient at 300 nL/min.
Acquire MS spectra on a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap Velos in ion trap mode or in Orbitrap mode with CID.
Analyze spectra manually for the presence of mBBI (monoisotopic mass = 2577.1 Da) at various charge states.
Note: Pure sample of mBBI, synthesized by BioBasic, was used as a reference for identification.
Immunohistochemical Staining of Mouse Cryo Cross-Section
Experimental Details
and Rationale
This technique was employed to study any possible immunological responses induced by the transdermal patch, the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, and mBBI. Mice skin tissue samples were obtained from 9 mice at day 2 (samples 1-3 for all treatments) and the rest of the mice samples were obtained on day 5 (samples 4-6 for all treatments) of the study. The skin tissue samples were then fixed, sectioned, and stained. Due to lack of training and materials, members of the Jenne lab had to perform most of the experiment. However, a member of the team periodically assisted or observed them.
