Chemostat
Order necessary materials.
Motor Shield explanation for construction.
Cut holes in the Styrofoam container to fit growth tubes at the bottom for support and the lid for the tubes to leave without any trouble. Additional holes must be punctured into the sides of the container in order for the led strip to lay flat against the rear wall. The lid can further be cut in half about two-thirds from the rear, this will be a peep hole.
Arduino
Motor Shield explanation for construction.
The pump must also be soldered which can be connected to the DC motor blocks. (Maximum of 2 per shield.)
