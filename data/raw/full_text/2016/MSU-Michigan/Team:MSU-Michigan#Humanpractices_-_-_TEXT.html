Outreach
Back in May, applied and received a Building with Bio kit through NSF. The kit is designed to help out with outreach events. While many of the activities were aimed at children in elementary school through high school, there was also a kit to set up a forum discussion designed for anyone over the age of 14. The activities focus on synthetic biology and exposing people to genetic modification. We were lucky enough to partner with a local children's science museum in the Lansing area for our event - Impression 5. We are incredibly thankful for the help of those at the museum for allowing us to set up in an open area of the museum and work with the kids and their families.
On Saturday, September 17, our team stopped by Impression 5 to run our outreach event. We brought two activities with us: Kit of Parts and Super Organisms.
