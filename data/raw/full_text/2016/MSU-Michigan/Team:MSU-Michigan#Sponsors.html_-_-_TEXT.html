Thank You to Our Sponsors
Thank you to all of our wonderful sponsors which have enabled us to run this project. We also wish to acknowledge Dr. Yuzuru Tozawa, from Saitama University, for giving us permission to use his spectinomycin riboswitch plasmid design.
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team!
