Basic Parts
Several basic parts are constructed during the summer and we contributed to the iGEM Registry with one of the most important coding sequence in our project, which is ready to be used in most of cyanobacterial species.
â€¢ Protein Coding sequence, desA
desA is a protein coding sequence, which translated and expressed in Synenochococcus elongatus PCC 6803 only by cold induction (temperature-regulated). It is also predicted that the expression of this cold-induced gene is regulated by its membrane fluidity. As temperature is decreasing, the membrane will be less fluid and signal the expression of desaturase enzyme to increase the concentration of unsaturated fatty acid thus counterparts the effect.
