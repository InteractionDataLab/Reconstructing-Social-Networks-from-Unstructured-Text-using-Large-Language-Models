Below is a list of the requirements for each of the medals. Those completed by the MSU iGEM are indicated with a ✔ while those that are not are marked with a ➜
Bronze medal requirements:
✔ Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree
✔ Meet all deliverables on the Requirements Page (section 3) , except those that specifically mention parts.
✔ Team needs to document their project on their Team Wiki Page by October 19.
✔ Each team must present a poster of their project at the Giant Jamboree.
✔ Each team has 20 minutes to present their project at the Giant Jamboree. The presentation must be given by a student.
✔ Teams need to attribute all of the dwork done for their project correctly by October 19.
✔ Teams must create and document Part pages on the Registry for the Parts they make by October 19.
✔ Submit DNA samples of your new Parts to the Registry by October 21.
✔ First safety check-in by September 16 and updated throughout the season.
✔ About Our Lab Form by July 15.
✔ About Our Project Form by July 15.
✔ Final Safety Form by September 16.
✔ Judging Form by October 14.
✔ Create a page on your team wiki with clear attributions of each aspect of you project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, adcisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
✔ Document at least one new substantial contribution to the iGEM community that showcases a project made with BioBricks. This contribution should be equivalent in difficulty to making and submitting a BioBrick part.
Silver Medal Requirements:
✔ Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part's/Device's Registry entry. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
➜ Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
➜ iGEM projects incolce important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of pervious teams' exemplary work).
Gold Medal Requirements (at least 2 of the following criteria):
➜ Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
➜ Improve the function OR characterization of an existing iGEM project (that your team did not originally create) and display your achievement on you wiki.
➜ Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept.
➜ Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab.
