Add LyseBlue reagent to Buffer P1 at a ratio of 1 to 1000.
Add the provided RNase A solution to Buffer P1, mix and store at 2-8°C
Add ethanol (96-100%) to Buffer PE before use (see bottle label for volume).
All centrifugation steps are carried out at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a conventional table-top microcentrifuge.
1.- Pellet 1-5 ml bacterial overnight culture by centrifugation of &gt;8000 rpm (6800 x g) for 3 min at room temperature (15-25°c).
2.- Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 lBuffer P1 and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube. 
3.- Add 250 lBuffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times until the solution becomes clear. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed for more than 5 min. If using LyseBlue reagent, the solution will turn blue.
4.- Add 350 lBuffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times. If using LyseBlue reagent, the solution will turn colorless.
5.- Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top microcentrifuge. 
6.- Apply 800 l supernatant from step 5 to the QIAprep 2.0 spin column by pipetting. Centrifuge for 30-60 s and discard the flow-through.
7.- Wash the QIAprep 2.0 spin column by adding 0.5 ml Buffer PB. Centrifuge for 30-60 s and discard the flow-through. Note: This step is only required when using endA+ strains or other bacterial strains with high nuclease activity or carbohydrate content.
8.- Wash the QIAprep 2.0 spin column by adding 0.75 ml Buffer PE. Centrifuge for 30-60 s and discard the flow-through. Transfer the QIAprep 2.0 spin column to the collection tube.
9.- Centrifuge for 1 min to remove residual wash buffer.

</P><H3><U><FONT face="Georgia" color="#F88017">Protocol 10 - Enzyme Assay</FONT></U></H3><P>Set up the reaction using the following scheme:
1) Determine the amount (total ug and total ul) of DNA to be digested.
2) Use the ug amount of DNA to determine how many enzyme units to use.
3) Determine how many ul of enzyme to use, using the enzyme concentration (we used 1uL of each enzyme, this will vary depending on the type of enzyme you are using. The enzymes we used were Xba I and Spe I).
4) Choose a total volume for the reaction. The enzyme volume must be 10% or lessof the total digest volume, so choose a reaction volume that is at least 10 times the amount of the enzyme volume added. Choose a total volume, the minimizes the addition
of water.
5) Determine the amount of buffer to use. The buffers used in the reaction are
usually 10x stocks, which means they must be 10% of the final volume.
6) Finish reaction set up by adding water as necessary.
7) Digest at optimum temperature for 60 minutes.
8) Run a gel to verify the reaction is complete! (See Protocol 8 and 2).
