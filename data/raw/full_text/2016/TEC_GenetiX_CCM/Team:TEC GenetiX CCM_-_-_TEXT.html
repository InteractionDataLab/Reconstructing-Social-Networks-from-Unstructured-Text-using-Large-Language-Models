Welcome to our wiki. We are Tec GenetiX CCM, from Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey Campus Ciudad de México. We are a student group of  high school students, all of us science enthusiasts. The group began in 2014 and has grown ever since. We have already attended two iGEM competitions previously. In our third participation at iGEM, we are planning to do a better job than previous years, always outdoing ourselves.
