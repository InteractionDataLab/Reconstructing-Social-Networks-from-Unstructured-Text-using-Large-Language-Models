I am mexican and I am studying in third semester of junior high at Tecnologico de Monterrey CCM. I am really passionate in science, and social impact action. I describe myself as a very creative, social and smart person. I am in Genetix because it is a group made for science and also have social activities to share and spread science. Its a place where I can be myself, and apport to share my knowledge to others. Also is a way to be in IGem, and develop my abilities to my future, due to the fact that I want to study biochemistry. This development is also useful to my school work. My future aspirations are to work on the scientific field and help the society by this way.

I am interested in studying how the human brain works and Genetix gave me the opportunity to learn the practical laboratory and research skills that I did not get from my other classes. Most importantly I’ve experienced how dedication and persistence are the key to the solution of difficult problems, which wouldn't have been possible without a team who shared the best of themselves in the pursue of helping and improving people’s lives.

I joined GenetiX at the end of my first semester. At first, I joined the iGem competition because I wanted to help with the chemical part of the project, but came to like Human Practices and the biotechnological part quite a lot too. iGem has given me several important abilities, such as teamwork, leadership skills and valuing hard work, as well as broadening my interests and perception of the world around me.
I am really excited about participating in iGem and learning from other teams as well as showing them that there are hard working people in Mexico looking for opportunities

I started to study programming at the start of high school, being now the coordinator of wiki in the group, and taking care of the software. Maybe some people call me crazy, but I think this is the reason I can continue to move forward to a maybe uncertainty future, but sure that I'm capable of doing all the things that I propose. Maybe I really don't know what to do in my future, but i know that it will be awesome because I want to go against the world at my own game. GenettiX for me is a place different to all the world, it will let you realize how awesome the people are.

For the first time this year I had the privilege to lead our school’s iGem team, and it’s been the most challenging, fun and engaging activity I’ve ever taken part of. I’ve always been interested in biology, chemistry and physics; but I like how iGem projects integrate what we do in the lab and take it even further, right into the real world. Overall, the iGem experience is without a doubt a fantastic opportunity to get more involved with science and actual research even before college: a life-changing experience I won’t hesitate to recommend to any student interested in the topic!

But what truly interest me within it, is the great potential that we have thrue science to change the world for better. The things that we have accomplished as a scientific community are just terrifically unbelievable and to think what we can accomplish in a few years, just thrills me. I think that both GenetiX and iGem are a great opportunity to start that change. Also, I participate in Models of United Nations (MUNs) . I was primary founder of the Debate Club in Tecnologico de Monterrey and we are going to participate next November on “Panamericanos”. Everything that I do is focused on achieving that change, because I want that every time someone mentions the word “future” they don’t think about a mass of gray polluted injustice, but as a bright community full of opportunities and hope.

I'm currently 18 years old and really interested in natural sciences, cooking, science fiction, videogames and travel. I joined GenetiX whilst on my third semester and decided to participate in the IGem project mostly because of chemistry but also to learn bio-engineering, which I ended up enjoying quite a lot, and I decided to take up the task of creating and coordinating the mathematical model. This project has given lots of abilities and knowledge, as not only have I learned the basics of bio-engineering and biology in general, but I have also become very adept at chemistry and lab practices , even taking a course on the subject. It helped a lot with teamwork, because it is taken to a whole new level when working on such a big, multidisciplinary project and it widened my perception of the world and the possible routes for my academic future.
I am very eager and excited to participate on a competition of such magnitude and international recognition. It is an amazing opportunity to learn more about the world and the different cultures by meeting people from around the world with a similar way of thinking. Such a multicultural event is one in a lifetime chance, and doing it together with a group that has become a second family to me is more than I could ask for.

I’m interested in science (especially medicine, chemistry and biotechnology), music and sports. I joined GenetiX during my first semester because it fitted with my interests and I wanted to expand my knowledge outside of what I was given in class. iGEM has given me the opportunity to discover a whole new world and improve my scientific and research skills. However, the competition has not only given me knowledge but a group of friends how I consider like my family now. I’m interested in comprehending how the human body works, as well as what can I do to improve my world with the knowledge I have acquired so far.

I joined because I wanted to improve on my searching skills and got more knowledge.

I'm really interested in math, literature, music and chemistry. This is my second time participating in an iGEM competition, and this is my fourth semester as a member of GenetiX. Both GenetiX and iGEM have given me an opportunity of improving my research and analysis skills, and showed me a new version of the world in which I can actually learn how and why things happen. As a part of GenetiX, being able to help the team with projects and ideas has been an amazing experience. In this team I have found friends rather than only work partners, and in the knowledge I've acquired while participating in iGEM and being part of the group I have found a new way of understanding everyday events.
