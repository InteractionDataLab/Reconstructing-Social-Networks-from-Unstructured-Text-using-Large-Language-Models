CONCLUSION
The Birth of Healer & A Story of Us
Several ideas were created and several ideas were denied. Our eyes were blocked by 3-phenoxybenzoate acid(3-PBA), the main intermediate product of pyrethroids. But what is 3-PBA and what are pyrethroids? Why we need to degrade 3-PBA thoroughly and how to degrade it through employing microbial biodegradation techniques? Once our Healer (the engineered bacteria) were born, how to put it into practice? From knowing to deep knowing, our efforts made it real.
Key words:
Cause (what is 3-PBA and what are pyrethroids? Why we need to degrade 3-PBA thoroughly?)
Method (How to degrade it through employing microbial biodegradation techniques?)
Extention (How to put it into practice?)
