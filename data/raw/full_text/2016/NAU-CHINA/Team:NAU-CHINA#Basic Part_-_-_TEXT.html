This basic part encodes Catechol 2,3-Dioxygenase from Sphingobium sp. YBL2. This protein transforms catechol by meta-cleavage to the bright yellow product 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde(2-HMS). We tested it with J23100 (a strong promoter) and its native rbs before it and a double terminator after it in E.coli. It plays a great role in our project to degrade catechol to 2-HMS, a non-toxic molecule that can be metalbolized by E.coli DH5α.
Verification of the function of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from YBL2
Background
Catechol is a toxic organic metabolite found in the degradation of pesticide. Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase can rapidly convert catechol into 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (2-HMS). 2-HMS is a non-toxic, bright yellow molecule that can be metalbolized by E.coli DH5α.

Functional Verification
Method
Step one: Transformed the vector into E.coli (DH5α) and streaked it on LB agar with chloramphenicol.
Step two: Dripped 100μL 0.2mol/L catechol onto the colonies, and placed at 37℃ for 10 minutes.
*Note that the catechol solution should be kept away from light and air.
The picture below shows the plate before and after dripping catechol solution. It indicated that 2-HMS was produced by C23O.
