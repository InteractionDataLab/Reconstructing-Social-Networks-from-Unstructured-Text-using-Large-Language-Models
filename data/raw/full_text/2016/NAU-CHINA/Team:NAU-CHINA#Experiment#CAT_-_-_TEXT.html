CONCLUSION
Verification of the function of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from YBL2
Background
Catechol is a toxic organic metabolite found in the degradation of pesticide. Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase can rapidly convert catechol into 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (2-HMS). 2-HMS is a non-toxic, bright yellow molecule that can be metalbolized by E.coli DH5α.

Functional Verification
Method
Step one: Transformed the vector into E.coli (DH5α) and streaked it on LB agar with chloramphenicol.
Step two: Dripped 100μL 0.2mol/L catechol onto the colonies, and placed at 37℃ for 10 minutes.
*Note that the catechol solution should be kept away from light and air.
The picture below shows the plate before and after dripping catechol solution. It indicated that 2-HMS was produced by C23O.
*pbaC as negative control (CK).

BBa_J33204:Experience
We also used BBa_J33204 to construct a device and demonstrated that it worked out well.
BBa_J33204 includes the xylE gene .This gene encodes the enzyme catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (metapyrocatechase), which also converts catechol to the bright yellow product 2-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconic semialdehyde.
