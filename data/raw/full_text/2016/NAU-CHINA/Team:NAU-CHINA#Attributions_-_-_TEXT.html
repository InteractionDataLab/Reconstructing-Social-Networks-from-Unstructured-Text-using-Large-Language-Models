>Student team members
Chen Xia made her efforts in construction of the basic parts and conducted the experimental testing. She also focused on the experiments of the gene catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from Sphingomonads sp. YBL2.
Guo Ruixuan was responsible for the arrangement of some daily affairs, including daily experiment supplies, meeting record, adminstrative examination and approval and etc..Communicated with teachers and others ,involved in the most basic experiment and the part of human practice.
He Yuxin was responsible for making competent cells and filling in safety form .she also helped Chen Xia to construct parts and completed the site-directed mutagenesis of gene mhb.
Jiang Zehui was the designer of our logo, wiki, poster, Power Point template and team shirts.Conducted the poster-processing for datagrams and photos in our wiki and PPT sildes.
Liu Huaming was mainly responsible for the poster design、jersey design 、brochure  design about our task and some souvenir design for propaganda work of the team.In addition,he participated in the badge design of our team.
Pang Yu was in charge of physcial unit 3D building.
Ping Xiaofei designed the physical unit and involved in part of experiment , human practice and wiki arrangement and editing.
Qin Chenrui put forward this project and mainly focused on the testing the function of the promoter by FCM. She also designed the RBS sequences to tune different expression level. In addition, she assisted Shi Kejian to assemble the genetic circuits.
Ruan Kai made dynamic modeling and benefit-cost function.
Shi Kejian was in charge of toxicity experiment with fruit fly and detection of degradation efficiency of 3-pba and 3-hba using HPLC. He also made his efforts in constructing the final passway.
