One –step site –directed mutagenesis
Introduction: Site-directed mutagenesis is a molecular biology method that is used to make specific and intentional changes to the DNA sequence of a gene and any gene products.
The limitation of restriction sites in cassette mutagenesis may be overcome using polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide "primers".

Culture preservation
Introduction :
Bacterias can be stored for months and years if they are stored at -80℃ and in high percentage of glycerol
Materials:
50% glycerol solution
Day/overnight culture
1.5mL centrifuge tube
Method:
Pick a single colony off a plate and let grow in an appropriate selectable liquid medium (5ml) overnight.
Add 400 uL 50% glycerol into a 1.5mL centrifuge tube.
Add 600 uL bacteria liquid .
Gently vortex to ensure that the culture and glycerol are well-mixed.

GEL extraction
Steps:
Perform agarose gel electrophoresis to fractionate DNA fragments. Use fresh TAE as running buffer.
When adequate separation of bands has occurred, carefully excise the DNA fragment of interest using a wide, clean, sharp scalpel. Minimize the size of the gel slice by removing extra agarose.
Determine the appropriate volume of the gel slice by weighting it in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Assuming a density of 1 g/mL, the volume of gel is derived as follows: a gel slice of mass 0.3 g will have a volume of 0.3 mL.
Add 1 volume Binding Buffer (XP2).
Incubate at 50-60℃ for 7 minutes or until the gel has completely melted. Vortex or shake the tube every 2-3 minutes.
Insert a HiBind DNA Mini Column in a 2 mL Collection Tube.
Add no more than 700uL DNA/agarose solution from step 5 to the HiBind○R DNA Mini Column.

Repeat step 7-9 until all of the sample has been transferred to the column.
Add 300uL Binding Buffer (XP2).
Centrifuge at maximum speed (≥13,000×g) for 1 minute at room temperature.
Discard the filtrate and reuse collection tube.
Add 700uL SPW Wash Buffer.
(Note: SPW Wash Buffer must be diluted with 100% ethanol prior to use.)
Centrifuge at maximum speed (≥13,000×g) for 1 minute at room temperature.
Discard the filtrate and reuse collection tube.
Repeat steps 14-16 for a second SPW Wash Buffer wash step.
Centrifuge the empty HiBind○R DNA Mini Column for 2 minutes at maximum speed to dry the column matrix. To further dry it, let sit at room temperature for a few minutes.
Transfer the HiBind○R DNA Mini Column to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.

Weigh 0.5g agarose for DNA electrophoresis, put it in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask, add 50 mL 1xTAE buffer and mix, then put the Erlenmeyer flask in the oven and heat to boiling until the agarose is completely dissolved.
Turn off the microwave, remove the fluid to model, let sit at room temperature until gel completely solidified, it takes about 30 minutes. Remove the tape, pull out the comb, put the plastic sheet into the electrophoresis tank.
Add 1xTAE buffer into the electrophoresis tank above the gel surface around high 2mm.
Using pipette to transfer samples. Add mixture of 5 uL DNA sample and 2ul 10x loading  buffer to spotting holes.
Power on, and adjust the voltage to 120 volts. After 15-20 minutes of electrophoresis, remove the gel plate, staining in ethidium bromide solution for 10min, then observe the result under UV light.

Take 0.5mL bacterial fluid to 100mL LB(in 250mL conical flask) and cultures in shaker incubator at 37°C with a speed of 180rpm/min to OD600=0.35~0.4 (normally it takes 1.5-2 hours) .
Packing those bacterial fluid in two 50mL centrifuge tubes and place them on ice for 10 min.
Precipitate the cells by spining at 4,000rpm for 10 min at 4°C with refrigerated centrifuge.
Discard the supernatant and add 10mL CaCl2 (0.1mol/L) to resuspend cells gently. Place them on ice for 30 minutes.( 0.1mol/L CaCl2 solution needs to be precooled at 4°C).
Centrifuge at 4,000rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C and discard the supernatant ./li>
Gently resuspend the cells with 1.2mL CaCl2 solution and 0.8 mL glycerin(50%).
Aliquote the cells to 100uL at 1.5mL centrifuge tube(these tubes should be precooled on ice or liquid nitrogen) and place them into liquid nitrogen immediately. Then they can be used for transformation or stored at -70°C.
Colony PCR
Colony PCR can be used after a transformation to screen colonies with desired plasmid. Primers are used to generate a PCR product of known size. Thus, any colony that gives rise to an amplification product of the expected size is likely to contain the correct DNA sequence. Choose a forward primer from plasmid and a reverse primer in the insert fragment separately.

In-fusion biobrick assembly
Introduction: This method describes an alternative assembly method that allows for BioBricks to be assembled via fusion of PCR products. One PCR-amplified BioBrick has homology on each end with the second PCR-amplified BioBrick (vector amplified with the BioBrick) to allow for the fragments to be fused together in the In-Fusion reaction. This method can be adapted to fuse more than two BioBricks together and four fragments have been successfully fused. The advantages of In-Fusion BioBrick assembly over standard assembly are that it is faster, does not require restriction digestions or ligations or DNA extraction from a gel.
Step one: Select a base vector and identify the insertion site. Linearize the vector by restriction enzyme digestion
Step two: Design PCR primers for your gene of interest with 15 bp extensions (5’) that are complementary to the ends of the linearized vector.
Step three: Amplify your gene of interest through PCR
Step four: Purify your PCR product
Step five: Set up your In-Fusion cloning reaction: (10ul)
2 ul of 5X In-Fusion HD Enzyme Premix
X ul of Linearized Vector
X ul of Insert
X ul of dH2O to a Total Reaction Volume of 10 ul. Mix well.
Step six: Incubate the reaction for 15 min at 50°C, then place on ice.
Step seven: Transform competent cells with 2.5 ul of the reaction mixture.
