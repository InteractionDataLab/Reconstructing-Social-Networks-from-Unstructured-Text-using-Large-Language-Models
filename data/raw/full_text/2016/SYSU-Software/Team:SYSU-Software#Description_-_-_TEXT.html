OUR
CONSIDERATION
Construct target synthetic biological systems in
complex environment.
Synthetic biology uses a series of basic circuits to solve many
problems. However, as to the systems with more complex func-
tions, there have not been some certain general design proce-
dures for them, due to the fact that many restrictions for model-
ing and experiments do exist. Also, at the community level, there
is no general rule for constructing biosystems.
Problems
Limited research targets
The standard research process of synthetic biology is from
natural research to standardization, design synthetic biological
system and wet-lab validation respectively. Owing to the restri-
ctions of standard process, the standardized circuits are always
from natural circuits, resulting many potential optimal solutions
could not be found at one time.
Massive Data
Moving to the step of design, owing to the complexity of bio-
logical systems and the diversity of species, it is almost impossible
to construct feasible synthetic biosystem by ourselves. At the
same time, the large data volume adds to the burden of process-
ing them.
Complexity in experiment design
Concerning the wet-lab validation, experiment design in syn-
thetic biological system can be extremely convoluted and
time-consuming.
Load of Computation
As the research further develops and the number of user in-
creases, not only the model accuracy and data volume will in-
crease significantly, but the computational burden will be larger
and larger as well.
OUR
SOLUTIONS
Problems
Craft all feasible combinations
By using CRAFT, all the combinations of available circuits
and chassis can be obtained based on the needs of our users.
Evolution in Silicon
Our software simulates the natural selection pressure by
artificial constraints, making a certain synthetic biological
system which best suits the “natural environment” to be kept.
Also, by using CRAFT Square, which simulates divergent evo-
lution, our software can save the proper schemes and satisfy
diversification of user requirements at the same time.
Standard protocol
Based on the standard protocol frame, after users entering
their requirements, CRAFT can automatically design and con-
struct corresponding experiment protocols, which cutting
down the time-consuming procedures of choosing chassis, de-
signing circuits and experiment planning.
Distributed Computing
“Satellite” is the name of our distributed computing plug-in.
It enables arithmetic capability scalable, in order to satisfy the
huge needs of computing work.
OUR
PROJECT
CRAFT Designer: An integrated auto-design system that helped
users customize their synthetic biological system by setting a
series of restriction conditions and generate standard protocol
corresponding to previous system.
CRAFT Square: A communication system that provide users a
platform to scan and evaluate other designs, share their own sys-
tems or look for better solutions.
Satellite: A distributed computing plug-in for CRAFT Designer.
