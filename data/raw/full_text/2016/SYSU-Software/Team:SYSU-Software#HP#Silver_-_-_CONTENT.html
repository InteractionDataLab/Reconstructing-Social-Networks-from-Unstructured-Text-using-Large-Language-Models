By using the electronic bricks</P></LI><LI><P>to symbolize the different parts in synbio, we managed to introduce the four fundamental parts to the public by visual-</P></LI><LI><P>ized approaches. If a circuit is completed correctly, a light bulb which symbolizing a certain functional CDS would be</P></LI><LI><P>lightened.

Our presentation</P></LI><LI><P>explained three main factors that led to success in synthetic biology: standardization, decoupling and abstraction. We</P></LI><LI><P>emphasized the importance of standardization, which enabled the biologists to create circuits having specific functions</P></LI><LI><P>with “Bio-bricks” like building constructions with bricks. This principle was also most familiar with these students be-</P></LI><LI><P>cause they had learnt something about genetic biology, and noticed the deficiencies in digested operation if restriction.</P></LI><LI><P>sites unspecific between gene parts. Although the other two principles, decoupling and abstraction, was hard to image</P></LI><LI><P>their roles in synthetic biology for these students, we believed their main idea would help students when they had to</P></LI><LI><P>face some complex problems in the future.</P></LI></UL></DIV><DIV style="display:block" class="medal_ul"><UL><LI><P>   We also introduced the target strata in synthetic biology, including sequence, part, device and system.
