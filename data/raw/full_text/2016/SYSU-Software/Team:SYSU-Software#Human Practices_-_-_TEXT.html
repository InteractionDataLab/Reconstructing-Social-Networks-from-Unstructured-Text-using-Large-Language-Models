OVERVIEW
During our project, we performed or participated in several Human Practices activities, cover-
ing scientific and social thinking , project assessment and public engagement .
In these activities, we used materials to illustrate the mechanism of standard elements in synbio
to the public, talked with senior high school students and freshmen with basic principles and
potential safety problems. We also consulted with the teachers majored in biosafety, asking about
the laws and regulations in our country and our college on synbio or software. We collaborated with
SYSU-CHINA, organizing the Central China iGEM Consortium, with 28 iGEM teams attending. We found
deficiencies in our software design during Human Practice, including safety problems and model.
So we improve our design, making it easier, safer and more practical to use.
