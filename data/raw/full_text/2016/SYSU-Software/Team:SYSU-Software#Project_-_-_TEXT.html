ABSTRACT
CRAFT (Community-based Retro-synthetic Analysis Functional plaTform) is an integrated software for
crafting synthetic biological system from design, validation to share. CRAFT aims at constructing
community-level synthetic biological systems in specific environments. We are inspired by evolution theory
and “Design and Redesign” principle in synthetic biology, regarding customized restrictions as selection
pressure, and exporting protocols as standardized protocol. CRAFT can be divided into three parts, CRAFT Designer ,
system crafting engine; CRAFT Square , a platform for user a synthetic biological communication and
mutual assistance; Satellite , a distributed computing plug-in. We have developed five models
to support CRAFT, and validated its concept and function with wet-lab experiment .
