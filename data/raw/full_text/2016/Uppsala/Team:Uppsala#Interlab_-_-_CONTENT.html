The flow cytometer that has been used by the Uppsala iGEM team earlier years was unavailable this year. However, we had access to a fluorescence plate reader which allowed us to participate in the interlab study using the plate reader protocol. </P><H3 id="method">Method</H3><P>Thorough instructions for the interlab study are available at <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2016/c/c5/InterLab_iGEM2016_Plate_Reader_Protocol_Updated_July.pdf">iGEM.org</A>. The form for providing the results from the interlab study is available <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2016/6/64/TeamName_iGEM2016_Interlab_Sheet_1_updated.xls">here</A>.
</P><P>The protocol consists of two calibration protocols: OD600 reference point and FITC fluorescence standard curve, and a cell measurement protocol.
In each protocol, there are instructions on how to perform measurements with a plate reader or a cuvette reader. </P><P>Five different devices were provided by iGEM and included in the distribution kit. </P><P><TABLE style="width:100%"><TBODY><TR><TD>Positive control</TD><TD>J23151.B0032.E0040.B0010.B0012</TD></TR><TR><TD>Negative control</TD><TD>R0040</TD></TR><TR><TD>Device 1</TD><TD>J23101.B0034.E0040.B0015</TD></TR><TR><TD>Device 2</TD><TD>J23106.B0034.E0040.B0015</TD></TR><TR><TD>Device 3</TD><TD>J23117.B0034.E0040.B0015</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>In addition to this FITC standard and LUDOX solution was provided in the kit and used for calibration.

A Shimadzu UV-1800 cuvette spectrophotometer was used for calibration and measurement of OD600. A Fluoroscan Ascent was used for the calibration and measurement of fluorescence. </P><H4 id="OD600">OD600 Reference point</H4><P>Was performed as instructed in cuvettes. </P><H4 id="FITC">FITC fluorescence standard curve</H4><P>While preparing the FITC solution, the solution was incubated overnight to properly dissolve the FITC into 1X PBS. This was recommended in a note in the official protocol if the FITC was not dissolved after 4 hours. The rest of the protocol was performed as instructed in the Fluoroscan Ascent plate reader.</P><P>Settings used: 
Excitation wavelength: 485 nm
Emittation wavelength: 538 nm
Scaling factor: 0.7/1 
Integration time was varied between 20 ms and 80 ms. 

The variation in integration time did not cause a big difference on the results. 40 ms integration time was chosen for the presented results. </P><H4 id="Cell measurement">Cell measurement protocol</H4><P>The first day, E.coli DH5α was transformed with the five different devices provided by iGEM with our transformation protocol for chemically competent E.coli DH5α. The next day, 2 colonies of each device was inoculated into 5 ml LB+Chloramphenicol in a 50 ml Falcon tube. The lid of the tube was screwed down loosely and the tube was placed on a shaking table at 220 rpm overnight. </P><P>The third day, OD600 of each culture was measured in the calibrated cuvette spectrophotometer. Calculations were made with the provided excel sheet  and each tube was diluted with LB+Cloramphenicol to 10 ml of OD600 0.02 as instructed in 50 ml Falcon tubes. 100 μl samples were then collected each hour and kept on ice in 4℃ for later measurement. When 7 samples had been collected, measurements were done in the calibrated Fluoroscan Ascent plate reader. Both cultures of replicates with device 3 was notably clearer than all other cultures after 6 hours.</P><P>No measurements of OD600 were done on the plates. This was due to a misunderstanding of the protocol, and not enough sample volume was available to be able to do OD600 measurements in the cuvette spectrophotometer. </P><H3 id="results">Results</H3><P>Since no OD600 measurement was done on the hourly samples, we have no Fl/Abs600 data.
However, we can still compare the arbitrary fluorescence units of the different measurements to each other. </P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Figure 1. The fluorescence of the different samples as a function of time, corrected for the readout of LB media with 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol.

The mean fluorescence of the two replicates for each device (n=2), corrected for the readout of LB media with 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Error bars show standard deviation. </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H3 id="discussion">Discussion</H3><P>In figure 1 and figure 2, we can see that both replicates of device 3 have a fluorescence close to the values of the negative control. This is probably due to low growth of cells, since the culture looked clear even after 6 hours of incubation. Why this happened in both replicates is unknown. </P><P>While providing a mean and standard deviation of only two replicates is not very good form, figure 2 is a lot easier to read than figure 1. In figure 2, it is clear that device 2 has a higher fluorescence than device 1. </P></DIV></DIV><FOOTER><DIV class="container-fluid"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-2"><P><B>Contact</B><UL><LI><A href="http://igemuppsala.se/"> Uppsala iGEM association </A></LI><LI>  info@igemuppsala.se </LI></UL></P><A href="#nav">
