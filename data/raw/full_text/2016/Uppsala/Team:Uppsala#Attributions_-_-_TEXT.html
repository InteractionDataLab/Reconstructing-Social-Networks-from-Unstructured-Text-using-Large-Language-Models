Thanks to
Fredrik Lindeberg
For recruiting the team, planning the iGEM year and leading the team. Provided troubleshooting tips and helped get the team up to speed in the lab. Was the link between the team and the faculty. Did the interlab study and general labwork.
Jonas Mattisson
For leading the team by performing necessary planning, providing leadership and guidance when needed, as well as by being a link between team and faculty. Instructed the rest of the team on how to perform many lab procedures as well as how to evaluate certain results, on top of performing ordinary lab work. Performed the collaboration lab work and had a hand in a lot on the wiki. Did also plan several team building activities.
Nicolai Junge Pedersen
For providing clear leadership and a true eye for details and numbers in the microfluidics group. For contributing to the simulation and modelling work, as well as for making the initial reach outs to various science departments.
Olle Karlberg
Did a lot of the AutoCAD files Maintenance on Form 2 printer and in charge of making print order and making sure they got printed. For having such a positive attitude and technical know how. Therefore being a real morale booster.
Sara Lundberg
For doing a lot of the printing work, making the manufacturing manual and helping out with electroporation. For not backing down on any problem however difficult.
Maria Hesselman
For doing the presentation, making chips and doing the transformation experiments on the heat shock chip. For always being the one that thinks things through, being incredibly ambitious and taking on much of the wiki work. For doing yeast research and working with IMAC.
Sun Lee
For being the critical thinker.
Federico Turco
For leading the CRISPR group, providing knowledge and planning. For finishing the biobricks.
Ida Isolehto
For setting collaborations, general labwork and housing team activities. For doing yeast research.
Svanhildur Olafsdottir
For doing countless assembly’s and transformations during the summer. For working with IMAC and providing equipment for team activities.
Grim Kalman
For contributing to the simulation and modelling work. For working with IMAC, as well as always making sure there were coffee
Josef Pelcman
For making the graphics, invented the plexi-press and doing yeast research. For his competence and flexibility to work in various areas of the project.
Jakob Nyberg
For making the wiki layout, for his patience in explaining and helping on any computer issue. For never giving up when things don't go as expected on the lab.
Cecilia Furugård
For leading the UnaG lab group and performing research.
Tora Hävemark
For extensive lab work regarding UnaG For doing a lot of and helping others with SDS-page. For providing great lab music and homemade cupcakes.
Carolina Viman
For doing sonications, as well as for working and helping out with IMAC procedures.
