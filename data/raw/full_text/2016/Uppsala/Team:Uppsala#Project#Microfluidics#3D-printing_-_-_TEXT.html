3D-printing
To manufacture microfluidics chips you commonly use some sort of mold with channels and features on it, you then pour PDMS on this mold and bake the chip. To create these molds there are a variety of techniques but the most common ones include spin-coating or etching using electron/laser beams. The one thing these technologies have in common is that they are A: expensive and B: specialized. This means that labs which are not already using microfluidics are unlikely to have the machines and expertise to utilize them on hand.
We had neither the machines, nor the expertise so we decided on a radical and little used approach for making our molds: 3D-printing!  A lot of the first weeks was spent deciding on what machine to use and how to design the molds.   We decided on the Form2 printer, which is a resin SLA printer from Formlabs, launched in 2015 as a followup from the Form1 printer. The Form2 printer was released in late 2015 and so is one of the latest models currently available. The Form2 prints using a photopolymer liquid resin which is a resin that hardens when exposed to light of certain frequencies. During the print the Form2 printer shines a laser which hardens resin selectively. This allows for the layer-wise printing of a complex 3D model. This is in contrast to many other 3D-printers which use extrusion for printing. The Form2 printer has a maximum print size of 145 × 145 × 175 mm. The reasons that we wanted to use the Form2 printer was primarily
Ease of use: The Form2 printer is quite easy to use, requiring almost no technical expertise beforehand. The only thing that is required is knowledge (or willingness to learn!) 3D-modelling in the CAD format.
Commercially available: The Form2 printer is already out on the market and can be bought by anyone, and although it is pricey (about 3000 euros) it is not all too expensive for labs.
Precise: The print precision of the Form2 printer is very good, with a minimum layer size of 0.025 millimeters (25 micrometers) and the ability to create self-supporting structures at about the scale of 100 micrometers.
(Availability: A local lab at our university was already in possession of the Form2 printer, so we didn’t have to travel far or take contact with external organizations)
