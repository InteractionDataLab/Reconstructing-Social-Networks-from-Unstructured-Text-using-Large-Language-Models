BBa_K1886000
Device
pluxR->luxS
luxS is controlled by pluxR promoter. luxS is a kind of DPD synthetase, which could produce DPD (4,5-dihydroxy 2,3-pentanedione) under the cooperation of Pfs enzyme. DPD exists widely in Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria as the signaling factor for quorum sensing, in order to complete the information transfer process within different kinds of bacteria.

Device
AHL single-cycled oscillation pluxL-luxR-pluxR-luxI(LAA tag)-pluxL-luxR-pluxR-aiiA(LAA tag)
This circuit is composed of the constitutive promoter -- broken Ptet and membrane protein cph8. Under dark conditions, protein cph8 could transfer its  phosphoryl group to intracellular protein ompR (ompR is native protein carried by E.coli), and this process could be inhibited by 650-nm light.
BBa_K1886002
Device
AHL,DPD double-cycled oscillation pluxL-luxR-pluxR-luxI(LAA tag)-pluxL-luxR-pluxR-aiiA(LAA tag)-luxpR-luxS
Two molecules of luxR binds with AHL (catalyzed by luxI), and this compound will promote the activity of pluxR. pluxR controls the expression of gene aiiA , encoding the enzyme which degrades AHLs. And all of these form an AHL single-cycled oscillation.

Device
broken Ptet-cph8
This circuit is composed of the constitutive promoter -- broken Ptet and membrane protein cph8. Under dark conditions, protein cph8 could transfer its  phosphoryl group to intracellular protein ompR (ompR is native protein carried by E.coli), and this process could be inhibited by 650-nm light.

BBa_K1886007
Device
AND GATE-input
This is the input part of AND GATE. After being induced by IPTG, plac promoter activates the expression of T7 RNA polymerase which contains two  amber mutations (T7 ptag) . After being induced by L-arabinose, pBAD promoter activates the expression of a special tRNA (supD), which is used to identify amber mutation. In the wild-type E.coli, amber mutation will inhibit the translation of T7 RNA polymerase. Therefore, only when the two inputs exist together, T7 RNA polymerase can be expressed, and then T7 promoter can be activated to express the downstream gene.

Device
AND GATE-output-1
This is a report system to test the AND GATE made up of SupD tRNA coding gene and T7 polymerase with two amber mutations. T7 promoter is a very specific promoter which is transcribed only by specific T7 RNA polymerase. Following the PT7 promoter is the reporter gene GFP, Only when the two inputs are given, the GFP gene can be expressed.

Device
AND GATE-output-2
This is a report system to test the AND GATE made up of SupD tRNA coding gene and T7 polymerase with two amber mutations.
