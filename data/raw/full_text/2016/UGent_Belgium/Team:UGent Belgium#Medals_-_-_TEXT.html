Besides having fun and learning a lot this summer, we were successful in achieving several medal requirements. Please click on the criteria to be redirected to the affiliated page.
Bronze medal criteria (all criteria must be met)
Register for iGEM , have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree .
Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page:
Document your project on the Team Wiki
Attribute all of the work done for your project correctly
Create and document Part pages on the Registry for the Parts you make
Submit DNA samples of new Parts to the Registry
Safety forms:
About your lab
About your project
Final safety form
Judging form
Jamboree contributions:
Present a poster of your project at the Giant Jamboree
Present your project at the Giant Jamboree
Attributions: Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry:
BBa_K1896000: mSA2
BBa_K1896001: mGFOuv2
BBa_K1896012: INP_NC-streptavidin generator
BBa_K1896013: INP_NC-mSA2 generator
BBa_K1896014: mGFPuv2-streptavidin generator
Silver medal criteria (all criteria must be met)
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
BBa_K1896010: mGFPuv2 generator
BBa_K1896011: inaZ (INP) generator
BBa_K1896015: mGFPuv2-mSA2 generator
BBa_K1896016: INPRC-mGFPuv2 generator
BBa_K1896018: INPRC-mSA2 generator
BBa_K1896019: pXS-GG cloning vector
BBa_K1896020: pXW-GG cloning vector
Collaboration: Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way
Human Practices: iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities.
Golden medal criteria (at least two criteria must be met)
Integrated Human Practices: Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry:
BBa_K584027: Constitutive_Promoter + INP(Ice Nucleating Protein Generator)
BBa_K584021: Ice Nucleating Protein Gene - inaZ
BBa_K811003: INPNC
BBa_K283010: Streptavidin
Proof of concept: Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept.
Demonstrate your work: Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab.
At the Jamboree
Besides having a lot of fun at the Jamboree, learning about new topics, and meeting new people, we also managed to obtain a gold medal! UGent Belgium was also nominated for Best Measurement, Overgrad.
