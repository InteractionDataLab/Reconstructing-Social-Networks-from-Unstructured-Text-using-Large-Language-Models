Measures in the lab
Before starting we all got a (bio)safety training and we follow the lab (bio)safety rules and standard operating procedures. All plasticware (tips etc.) are disposed as biohazard waste. Liquid cultures are sterilized using bleach and an autoclave, petri dishes are also sterilized using an autoclave. The laminar flow cabinets (biosafety cabinet level 2) work with a laminar vertical flow, as these are safer. Other general measures are lab coats and gloves.
