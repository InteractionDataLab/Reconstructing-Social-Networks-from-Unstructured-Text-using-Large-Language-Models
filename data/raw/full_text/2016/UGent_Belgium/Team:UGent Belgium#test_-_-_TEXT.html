The aim of our project is to design an optimized 3D shape for condensing water, using a fusion protein of INP and streptavidin to increase our water collection.
The shape is be designed to be modular (so it can be scaled up easily) and stackable (so many units can be transported and stored easily and cheaply), and is 3D-printed in a PLA-filament containing biotin. To increase the condensation capabilities of our water collector, we attach a fusion protein of INP (Ice Nucleation Protein) with streptavidin to the biotin. INP is a protein of certain bacteria that improves the nucleation of ice at higher temperatures than normal. As condensation also involves nucleation, INP can be used to increase condensation, and hence water collection.
