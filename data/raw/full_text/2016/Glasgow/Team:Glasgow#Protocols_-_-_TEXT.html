Protocols
Described here are the various techniques we used in the course of our project
Preparation of CaCl2 Competent Cells
Dilute 400μl of overnight liquid culture into 20ml of broth with any necessary antibiotics to select for any plasmids already transformed into the cells
Incubate at 37⁰C, shaking at 225rpm for 90 minutes
Spin down for 2 minutes at 7000rpm at 4⁰C
Discard supernatant, resuspend pellet in 10ml of 50 mM CaCl2, keep on ice
Repeat centrifugation for 2 minutes at 7000rpm at 4⁰C
Discard supernatant and the resuspend pellet in 1ml of 50 mM CaCl2, keep on ice
CaCl2 competent cells can be kept on ice in the fridge overnight

Incubate the cells at 37⁰C. The time varies with the antibiotic resistance gene:
Resistance
Time

RNA Extraction
We used the RNeasy Mini Kit for RNA extraction from Qiagen .
Shortbread
A good supply of shortbread is essential to any productive lab environment. Recipe courtesy of BBC Food .
125g/4oz butter
55g/2oz caster sugar, plus extra to finish
180g/6oz plain flour
Heat the oven to 190⁰C/375F/Gas 5
Beat the butter and the sugar together until smooth.
Stir in the flour to get a smooth paste. Turn on to a work surface and gently roll out until the paste is 1cm/½in thick.
Cut into rounds or fingers and place onto a baking tray. Sprinkle with caster sugar and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.
Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until pale golden-brown. Set aside to cool on a wire rack.
