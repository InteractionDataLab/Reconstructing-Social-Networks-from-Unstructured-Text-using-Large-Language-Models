Our Team
Katy Baker
Degree: Biochemistry
From: Scotland
Katy is a full-time student, part-time Sumo wrestler. She is undefeated 5 years running, and in line to be world champion. Her infamous ‘SIT ON YOU’ move is difficult for opponents to recover from. She is a tank.
Pinja Hartikainen
Degree: Biochemistry
From: Finland
Pinja is the four-time consecutive winner of the annual Wife Carrying Championship but defies convention by carrying her “husband of the moment”. She celebrates her victories in the sauna whilst consuming her prize - her weight in beer.
Deanna van Spall
Degree: Genetics
From: England
Deanna is a pipette. The team thoroughly used and abused her during the course of iGEM. She is now broken and even though she is a Dee200, she will only ever take up 50ul.
Matej Vucak
Degree: Molecular and Cellular Biology
From: Croatia
Mat hates to smile and requests that all photographic evidence of such activity be obliterated.
Fergus O'Brien
Degree: Biomedical Engineering
From: Northern Ireland
Fergus is currently estranged from his family for declaring that he prefers sweet potatoes to white potatoes.
Liam Pollock
Degree: Molecular and Cellular Biology
From: Scotland
In 2011 Liam came 4th in the Annual Wild Haggis catching championship. He has since adopted a vegan lifestyle.
Simone Marcigaglia
Degree: Biomedical Engineering
From: Italy
Simone is a karaoke addict. Favourite artist: Britney Spears.
Lindsey McKerrell
Degree: Biomedical Engineering
From: Scotland
Lindsey is an international hand model and unbeaten reigning champion of Mortal Kombat, which she plays exclusively with her feet.
Catriona Watson
Degree: Genetics
From: Scotland
Catriona won several Ginger of the Year awards until her hair slowly became too blonde to be considered such. Sadly, she is now “strawberry blonde”.
Oliver Hawes
Degree: Computing Science
From: Somerset
I made everyone else write a profile but haven’t bothered to do one for myself.
Zuhair Elgaid
Degree: Biochemistry
From: Scotland
Zuhair was our intern.  Eat, sleep, iGEM repeat is his life motto
Advisors & Supervisors
Dr Julien Reboud
Julien's current research interests have a focus on integrating biology and engineering for the benefits of healthcare and industry. Two of his focuses are Acoustofluidics (for sample manipulation), and of course, synthetic biology.
Dr Sean Colloms
While not walking in the Scottish Highlands and shoulder crunching at prehistoric stone circles, Sean likes to tie knots in DNA and dream up new applications for DNA transposition and site-specific recombination.
James Provan
James was part of Glasgow's 2015 iGEM team, and loved it so much he's back for more.
Mhairi Davidson
Mhairi was also on last year's iGEM team, but decided to come back to spread joy and happiness during the difficult times of iGEM when nothing works.
