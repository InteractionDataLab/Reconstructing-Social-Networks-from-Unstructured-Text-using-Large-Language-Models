University of Glasgow
The University of Glasgow is the fourth-oldest university in the English-speaking world and one of Scotland's four ancient universities. It was founded in 1451. Along with the University of Edinburgh, the University was part of the Scottish Enlightenment during the 18th century. It is currently a member of Universitas 21, the international network of research universities. This iGEM team received financial support from the University of Glasgow.
Glasgow Polyomics
Glasgow Polyomics is a research facility at the University of Glasgow that applies state-of-the-art technologies to measure the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome from any biological system. This iGEM team received funding from Professor Michael Barrett, a Glasgow Polyomics affiliate. The team carried out rRNA depletion, RNA-seq experiments and Graham Hamilton carried out bioinformatic analysis on our behalf.
BBSRC
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) is a UK Research Council and NDPB and is the largest UK public funder of non-medical bioscience. It predominantly funds scientific research institutes and university research departments in the UK. This iGEM team received financial support from BBSRC.
Wellcome Trust
The Wellcome Trust is a biomedical research charity based in London, United Kingdom. It was established in 1936 with legacies from the pharmaceutical magnate Sir Henry Wellcome to fund research to improve human and animal health. The aim of the Trust is to "achieve extraordinary improvements in health by supporting the brightest minds", and in addition to funding biomedical research it supports the public understanding of science. This iGEM team received financial support from the Wellcome Trust.
The Society of Experimental Biology
The Society for Experimental Biology is a learned society that was established in 1923 at Birkbeck College in London to "promote the art and science of experimental biology in all its branches". The society has an international membership of approximately 2000. It covers both botany and zoology and has four sections: animal, plant, cell, and education and public affairs. This iGEM team received financial support from the Society for Experimental Biology.
IDT
Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT), headquartered in Coralville, Iowa, is the world's largest supplier of custom nucleic acids, serving the areas of academic research, biotechnology, clinical diagnostics, and pharmaceutical development. IDT's primary business is the manufacturing of custom DNA and RNA oligonucleotides (oligos) for research applications. This iGEM team received free DNA synthesis from IDT.
Undergraduate Students
Katy Baker: Worked on transforming S. thermophilus with BioBrick constructs. Developed Miniprep protocol for purifying plasmid DNA from S. thermophilus. Demonstrated at Glasgow Science Centre.   Social media boss.
Pinja Hartikainen: Created crtEBIY BioBrick compatible construct through a series of gene ligations. Presented at London teams meetup at Westminster.
Catriona Watson: Designed RNA extraction experiments for transcriptomics collaboration with Glasgow Polyomics. Demonstrated at Glasgow Science Centre. Created the final design for our mascot, Beta.
Liam Pollock: Created crtEBIY BioBrick compatible construct. Quantified levels of beta-carotene in E. coli with various native S. thermophilus promoters. Demonstrated at Glasgow Science Centre.
Matej Vucak: Created and quantified BioBrick constructs for use with S. thermophilus. Carried out Interlab measurements and submission.
Deanna van Spall: Isolated the antitoxin Epsilon for potential self-inactivation mechanism. Demonstrated at Glasgow Science Centre.
Lindsey McKerrell: Designed and created an accessible piece of hardware for solar pasteurisation.
Simone Marcigaglia: Designed and created an accessible piece of hardware for solar pasteurisation. Demonstrated at Glasgow Science Centre.
Fergus O’Brien: Designed and created an accessible piece of hardware for solar pasteurisation. Presented at London teams meetup at Westminster. Demonstrated at Glasgow Science Centre.
Oliver Hawes: Our tech guy. Wiki coding and design.
Supervisors/Advisors
Dr Julien Reboud (Lord Kelvin Adam Smith Fellow in Synthetic Biology, Biomedical Engineering, University of Glasgow) Supervisor: Our primary advisor - provided plate reader for fluorescence   measurements, gave us useful presentation feedback, and bought us pizza that one time.
Dr Sean Colloms (Lecturer in Synthetic Biology, Institute of Molecular Cell and Systems Biology, University of Glasgow) Supervisor: Our secondary supervisor - Provided equipment, consumables, lab space and advice about molecular biology.
James Provan - Advisor : Demonstrated lab techniques (multiple times). Showed incredible patience.
Mhairi Davidson - Advisor: Provided support with Exeter collaboration, general lab techniques, and experimental planning.
Dr Steph Holt: Helped with electroporating S. thermophilus when things were looking impossible.
Engineering Support
Ewan Russell: for 3D printing our magnificent valve.
Dr Andrew Glidle: for 3D printing our more magnificent valve 2.0.
Rankine Building Engineering Department: Thanks for the electronics!
General Support
Everyone in the Bower Building, University of Glasgow, for their support over the summer.
Thanks to the Scottish weather for providing us with one day of sun so we could test our initial solar concentrator.
Thanks to Lily Roberts for designing our modified iGEM logo!
Human Practice Support
Dr John Walls (Research Associate, School of Interdisciplinary Studies, University of Glasgow): Advised on public interest and social sciences
Jamie Gallagher (Public Engagement Officer, Research Strategy and Innovation Office, University of Glasgow): Outreach help and advice
Dr. Melanie Jimenez: Thanks for helping us plan the science centre visit, for our super cute video and for general outreach advice.
Glasgow Science Centre: for allowing us to participate in the Meet the Experts event.
Project Support
Glasgow Polyomics: Performed ten RNAseq experiments in order to distinguish differential gene expression in S. thermophilus based on casein exposure.
Maud Fléchard and Professor Pascal Hols (Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium): Gifted us with S. thermophilus LMD-9 strain, multiple plasmids, and protocols for working with S. thermophilus
Professor Chris French and Dr. Christine Merrick (University of Edinburgh): for sending us Biobricks from the 2011 distribution plates
iGEM Team Exeter: for providing us with an alternative Kill Switch for our yogurt.
