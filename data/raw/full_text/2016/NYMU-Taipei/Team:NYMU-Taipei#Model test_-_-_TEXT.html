TITLE
Besides the fungal killing switch and the functional prototype that help reduce concerns over GMO
Epidemic
B. dorsalis is a major cause of annual agricultural losses due to oviposition in fruits. Here we introduce our prototype trap and M. anisopliae, our genetically engineered fungi, to address this issue.
Our model aims to demonstrate that combining our prototype with the fungi can reduce B. dorsalis’ population. We selected the SEIR model, which fits the ideal assumption in epidemiology, and revised the model to make it more practical for our purpose.
Symbol
Description
Susceptible
B. dorsalis is slightly or moderately resistant to M. anisopliae
Exposed
B. dorsalis is exposed to a low amount of M. anisopliae in our trap; disease will be spread further during mating.
Infected
M. anisopliae enters B. dorsalis’ hemolymph and initiates cell division.
Death
B. dorsalis dies from the infection of M. anisopliae.
Based on our assumptions, we developed a set of differential equations that characterizes the nature of epidemic in our model:
dms/dt=daily_move_in-trap-death_rate*ms
dfs/dt=daily_move_in-death_rate*fs

Result
The graph above shows an initial growth in population due to the attraction of B. dorsalis from the environment. However, the population subsequently drops when infected by M. anisopliae. The results indicate that the use of prototype combined with the fungi yields a 70% decrease in the B. dorsalis population. Thus, we can put our product into practice a few weeks prior to the harvest to minimize crop damage.
