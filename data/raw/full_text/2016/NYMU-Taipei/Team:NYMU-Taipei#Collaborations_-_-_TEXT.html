Collaborations
Collaborated on pest prediction web establishment
1. NCTU provided us with expertise in FTP, web crawling, and the concept in pipeline. They also helped Streamline code, making it more readable and understandable. Provided the idea of open source, and we did put our code on github.
2. We first came up with the idea of forecasting web, and wrote program for web-crawling, data processing, machine learning, FTP uploading and write UI website.
Helped registered iGEM team from high school
We helped HSiTAIWAN with expertise on primer construction, PCR, plasmid and taught them how to design primer.
Collaborated on social research:
Assessment of transfer effectiveness of gene-technology related information
1. Our team was responsible for survey sheet design, writing research and data collection.
2. HSiTAIWAN first came up with the idea and was responsible for survey design, most of the data collection and check.
Collaborated with registered iGEM team from high school
We helped high school iGEM team TAS TAIWAN: 1. We invited TAS to NYMU summer camp. 2. We gave TAS advice on troubleshooting cloning procedure  3. We debugged their model on nanoparticle customizer. TAS TAIWAN helped us on: 1. Checked construct BBa_ K2040122. 2. Increased model efficiency and ran simulations using our data 3. Three TAS students on our team
Held 6 interschool meetup in Taiwan
1. We held a 6 interschool meetup in Taiwan, including TAS, CGU, NCTU, NTHU, NCCU and Tongji University. We had a great day practicing presentation, sharing idea and play World café.
Helped complete the survey in investigating world café as an effective tool to promote communication
1. Four of the participating schools, CGU, NCTU, NTHU and Tongji University, helped complete the survey that aims to promote iGEM Jamboree: How can we help teams interact with other teams at the Jamboree.
Participated in 2016 Asia-Pacific iGEM conference in NCKU
