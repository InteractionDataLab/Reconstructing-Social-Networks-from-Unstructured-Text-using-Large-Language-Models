TITLE
Besides the fungal killing switch and the functional prototype that help reduce concerns over GMO
Overview
Oriental fruit fly will make fruit dropped and rotton, that cause serious damage to Taiwan’s cash crop.
Because we want to improve existing oriental fruit fly trap, controlling it effectively, we design the pheromone trap and infrared counter with early-warning system, timing adjustment……
Character
Specificity-Methyl Eugenol
Methyl Eugenol is the pheromone precursor of oriental fruit fly.
The male oriental fruit fly is attracted strongly by it. After it takes Methyl Eugenol, male oriental fruit fly’s saliva can attract female one.
solve core problem–target female oriental fruit fly
A female B. dorsalis poses more of a threat：
1.   Can mate with 15 males in its life time
2.   Can lay 1400+ eggs in its life time
3.   Not attracted by pheromone trap
Design
Machanism
Advantage
1.   Can mate with 15 males in its life time
2.   Can lay 1400+ eggs in its life time
3.   Not attracted by pheromone trap
