Purpose
        Our model aims to figure out the efficacy of the IOS system by comparing the population of B. dorsalis with and without this system. Written in NetLogo(1), a software designed for modeling complex situations, the model combines both stochastic and deterministic methods. The stochastic part of the model was used to estimate the Metarhizium Anisopliae infection by our traps, whereas the deterministic part was used to simulate natural population growth of the flies. The efficiency of our IOS system predicted by this model is further used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of our prototype.
Rules
Assumption
This model follows the assumptions listed below:
The fly influx and efflux are always the same in the orchard.
The mortality caused by naturally existing anisopliae is considered as natural death while the death caused by M.anisopliae inside the traps and its infection afterward is regarded as IOS-caused deaths
The fly population has already reached the stable stage before the start of the simulation.
Natural Condition
The fly population obeys the discrete time logistic function:
  represents the population of fruit flies at time t.
Population of next generation is proportional to that of this generation by the coefficient r.
Population reaches a stable stage regulated by the number of capacity K.
Death caused by naturally existing anisopliae is considered as a part of K.
With IOS system
The addition of our IOS system leads to greater death rate caused by M. anisopliae in our traps and . The additional term is modified from SIR epidemic model:
Male flies within the attraction radius of the methyl eugenol from trap will be attracted to the trap by a certain probability.
After being trapped, male flies will be infected by anisopliae and released later.
Infected males are prone to spread anisopliae conidia to females while mating.
Females are likely to re-mate and thus are likely to spread anisopliae conidia further.
The overall lethality of the infection is described by the formula
where  represents the rate of infection spread, and
and
 represents the population of susceptible and infected flies at  units of time before.
Parameters
Model was a simulation of a one-hectare (100100m) orchard. Four traps and three counters (not shown) were deployed symmetrically in the orchard and their effective distance completely cover all the orchard.

Growth rate of fly. Calculated value from doubling time(2).

M. anisopliae infection spread rate. Calculated value from mating frequency(3).

The average population of fly per day.

On/off
Our IOS system is implemented when its value is “on”, and the original state is presented when its value is “off”.
fly-initial-amount
360
The initial population of oriental fruit fly in a hectare of orchard. Estimation based on this report(4).
Infective-distance
50
The distance that methyl eugenol in a trap is attractive to a fly.
attraction-rate
0.7
The probability that a male fly within the infective-distance will be attracted toward the closest trap.
base
360
The upper limit of the population in the model orchard environment. Since we presume the population already reached stable state before modeling, its value is exactly the same as fly-initial-amount.
Results
Population of both original state and IOS implementing conditions has been modeled and is shown below.
Scenario 1: the original state of fruit fly population
Scenario 2: fruit fly population after IOS implementation
The original population of fly per day is 355 and this number decreased to 231 after implementation of our IOS system. The population decreased by 35% when our IOS system is implemented, suggesting the high efficiency of our system.
