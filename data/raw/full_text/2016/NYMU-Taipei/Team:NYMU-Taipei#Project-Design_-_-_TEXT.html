Overview
We aim to design a entomopathogenic-fungi-specific kill switch system that does not affect the fungi’s pesticidal activities. Through utilizing the fungi’s life cycle alongside with light-induced termination element, we were able to construct our kill switch.
Design
Metarhizium anisopliae:
M. anisopliae serves as our chassis organism in this project due to its status as a model organism for biological insect control and wide spread us as an fungal biopesticide(1). It also have been the target for many genetic modification projects aimed at amplifying its insecticidal activities(2)(3). In our project, we will be utilizing the hemolymph-induced promoter of M. anisopliae, Pmcl1, as the controlling element for the production of the termination element, KillerRed.
Promoter mcl1, or Pmcl1, is the promoter that controls the production of Metarhizium-collagen-like-protein(3). In wildtype Metarhizium anisopliae, the transcripts of the Mcl1 gene could be detected within 20 minutes of the fungus contacting the hemolymph, but could not be detected when the fungus is cultured in any other medium(4). Utilizing Pmcl 1 means the production of KillerRed proteins will be strong and specific to the hemolymph infection phase if M. anisopliae’s life cycle.
KillerRed:
KillerRed protein is a red fluorescent protein with excitation and emission maxima at 585 and 610 nm respectively. When the protein comes in contact with light of wavelengths of 520-590 nm, it produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) along with intense photobleaching. The phototoxicity induced by KillerRed generated ROS is 1,000times greater than those produced by common fluorescent proteins5. The increase concentrations of ROS in the cytoplasm will disrupt normal cellular functions and impede fungal growth and, in the best case scenario, induce programed necrosis6.
Circuit
Kill Switch Circuit:
The kill switch circuit contains the hemolymph-induced promoter, Pmcl, followed by the KillerRed gene (BBa_K1184000) and a trpC terminator, TtrpC. This sets the mass production of KillerRed proteins to the hemolymph infection phase of M. anisopliae’s life cycle.
Construct backbone:
Our kill switch circuit is contained within pBARGPE1 fungi-specific vectors. This backbone grants transformed M. anisopliae phosphinothricin and () resistance with the phosphinothricin acetyltransferase, or BlpR, gene.
