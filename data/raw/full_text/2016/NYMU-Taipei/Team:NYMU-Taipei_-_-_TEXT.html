Prototype
We constructed a bait trap as an alternative to large-scale spraying to implement our fungus. Moreover, we made an infrared counter that record and send data to smartphones with a specific app installed. We also hope to construct an integrated orchard safeguard (IOS) for fruit growers. Click here to know more about the motivation and our prototype.

Forecasting Website
We have established a pest group size forecasting website that provides the prediction of the pest population size for the next 7 days based on meteorological data collected in the past 20 days. Click to visit our website and know more about the technique, detail, and collaboration !!!

Media Analysis
Disinterest and confusion are created when the media presents scientific knowledge in a way which hinders the absorption of the knowledge by the general public. Thus, we decided to conduct an analysis of the difficulty of the articles and the likeliness of the reader understanding their contents and an estimation of the percentage of positively and negatively presented article in different media.
