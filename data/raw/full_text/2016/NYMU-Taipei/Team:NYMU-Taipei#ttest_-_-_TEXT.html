Background
Potatoes all over the world are in danger and this is not the first time in history. In the late 1840s, potato late blight epidemics caused the Great Famine in Ireland and one million people were starved to death. This devastating disease is caused by the plant pathogenic oomycetes, Phytophthora infestans. Even now, when potatoes are widely grown in 135 countries and consumed by 1 billion people, late blight is still causing serious problems, including food insecurity, economic losses, and environmental damages.
Fig 1. Worldwide distribution of potato late blight caused by P.infestans
Potato late blight costs an annual loss of 6.7 billion USD. Although late blight have only little impact on the food supply in some areas, crop loss can still force farmers out of business. To control late blight, fungicides are frequently used, up to once every 3 days. These fungicides have enormous costs financially, at $200 per acre of farmland. Moreover, these chemicals often seep underground or escape to nearby streams and contaminate water sources. Water samples from over the U.S. show that 75% of surface waters and 58% of groundwater wells contain at least one of the 33 potato fungicides.
In modern agriculture, the use of fungicides and genetically modified potatoes are inefficient in fighting against potato late blight. Most strains of P. infestans have developed resistance against fungicides used nowadays. P. infestans secretes some enzymes and form high turgor pressure inside its cell to penetrate and colonize in potato cells. P. infestans infect potato leaves and tubers; eventually the entire plant rots and dies. The 2015 NYMU-Taipei iGEM team aims to prevent potatoes from being infected by this devastating disease and ensure global food security.

Collaboration with TAS Taipei iGEM team
We gave them the part with yebF, a motor protein that brings our product out of the cell. This was essential to their project because it allowed their protein, the granzyme B inhibitor, to be delivered out into the reservoir and to diffuse through the bandage.
Furthermore, NYMU hosted an educational summer camp welcoming members from the 2015 and 2016 TAS_Taipei iGEM teams to join and learn.
We have also been supportive for helping TAS_Taipei iGEM team with research and running the model for diffusion, bandage, and the ACT inhibition model.  We provided them with modeling expertise, literature values for our models and debugging expertise.
In addition to our help on TAS, we also collaborated with TAS
To provide us with the LuxR part which is pivotal for our oscillator. LuxR is essential for our oscillator which is used to report the presence of a malicious spore in the device part of the project.
TAS also helped us by running the initial experiments for our microbial fuel cell prototype. We were provided by TAS_Taipei with initial test results of the prototype for our project so that we found the correct soil to water to bacteria ratios(August 2015).
Three members of TAS (Alvin, Fiona and Huiru) are members of both NYMU and TAS teams. They worked at NYMU over the summer for the NYMU_Taipei team and are presenting with the team at the Giant Jamboree!
