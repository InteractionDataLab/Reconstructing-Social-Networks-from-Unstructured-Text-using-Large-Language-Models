8/16
pBAR_EL222_TtrpC transformed into competent cell
pBAR_EL222_TtrpC containing cultures used 2 in 1
[Collapse]
8/17
pBAR_EL222_TtrpC extracted and attempted to amplify with plasmid PCR------we did not amplify the target sequence (Hence, we tried ligation again)

pBAR_EL222_TtrpC transformed into competent cell
pBAR_EL222_TtrpC containing cultures used in 3 in 1
[Collapse]
8/19
pBAR_EL222_TtrpC extracted from transformed cultures, checked with restriction enzyme digestion and plasmid PCR (failure)
[Collapse]
8/28
pVP-EL222 and TtrpC PCR ligation ------- NC had bands
pVP-EL222 and TtrpC PCR ligation ------- used remixed primer
[Collapse]
8/29
pVP-EL222 and TtrpC PCR ligation ------- the concentration was not high enough after gel extraction
