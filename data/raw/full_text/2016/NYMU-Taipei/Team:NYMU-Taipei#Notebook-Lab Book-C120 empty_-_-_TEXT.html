pC120_empty resuspended (sample from University of Texas Southwestern)
pC120_empty transformation attempted (failed, no cultures on first plate)
[Collapse]

pC120_empty transformation
[Collapse]
7/15
pC120_empty extracted from transformed cultures and checked with PstI restriction digestion
[Collapse]
7/16
pC120_empty plasmid stored and transformed cultures cryopreserved
7/28
pC120_empty ran restriction digestion for the ligation with HindIII and BamHI (pC120_empty concentration was too low and contamination of the samples were detected)
