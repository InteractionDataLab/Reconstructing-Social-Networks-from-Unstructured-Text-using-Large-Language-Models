TITLE
Besides the fungal killing switch and the functional prototype that help reduce concerns over GMO
IR Counter
The purpose of our project is to utilize the a filamentous-fungi-specific CRISPR-Cas9 system 1 in conjunction with an optogenetic system 2 to construct a fast acting kill switch system for genetically engineered fungi, which is becoming ever more popular method for dealing with insect pest around the world. Two plasmids will be constructed, each carrying a module of our two part system. Metarhizium anisopliae ARSEF 549 will be transformed with both plasmids and inoculated on live specimen of Bactrocera dorsalis and Spodoptera litura to test the viability and efficacy of the system. If the system is viable, we think that it could be adapted for other organism for similar purposes.
