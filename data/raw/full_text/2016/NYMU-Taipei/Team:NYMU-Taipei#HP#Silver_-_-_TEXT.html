Abstract
This year, we visited and interviewed several of our project's stakeholders, including fruit growers, companies, high school teachers, college professors, and interest groups, from whom we received profound and valuable feedback. The information and opinion we have gathered strengthened our idea of establishing a pest forecasting website and conducting a more in depth research into information transfer between societal groups.
We also contact other iGEM teams, including Taiwanese iGEM teams and many other teams from the Asian-Pacific region. We held a meetup in NYMU on 8/6 and had a great time. We also conducted a survey to find out if world café would be a good way to help teams interact with one another at the Jamboree.
Last but not least, we went to I-lan Senior High School to visit a biology teacher who immersed himself in flipped-classroom. During our visit, we also shared basic concepts of synthetic biology and presented several issue to high school students.
You will definitely love our human practice.
