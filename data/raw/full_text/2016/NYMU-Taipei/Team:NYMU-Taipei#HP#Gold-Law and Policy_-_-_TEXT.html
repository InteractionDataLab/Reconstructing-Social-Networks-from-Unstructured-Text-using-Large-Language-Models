Law and Policy
Sustainable agriculture is a global trend. Currently, many countries are joining this trend by adjusting their law for the purpose of establishing an eco-friendly farming environment. However, Taiwan’s laws on biological control agents are slightly outdated. Thus, we compared laws and regulations on biological control agents of US, European Union, and China, hoping to find out which part of Taiwan’ s law should be changed.

According the table above, we suggested that Taiwan’s lawmakers should be aware of the regulation of Residue Chemistry and advertisement since there were more than two countries in the world that have regulations on those aspects of biological pest control agents.
Let us examine in more detail about the law and regulation of those three countries and the European Union!
US Regulations
What are Biological pesticides(Biopesticides)?
Biological pesticides are types of pesticides derived from natural materials, such as animals, plants, bacteria, and certain minerals.
Requirements
New pesticide application has to pass the “pre-registration meeting” first. The applicant also need to hand in the required data required data to proceed to the assessment stage.
Reference
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA)
40 CFR 158.2120: (1) Product Chemistry (2) Specifications
40 CFR 158.2130: Residue Chemistry
40 CFR 158.2140: Data from Studies that Determine Hazard to Humans and Domestic Animals
40 CFR 158.2150: Data from Studies that Determine Hazard to Non-target Organisms and Environmental Fate
European Union Regulations
What are Biological pesticides(Biopesticides)?
None.  They use “active substances” to classify the pesticide.  According to Regulation 1107/2009, there are “chemical substance” and “microbial” two classes.
Requirements
First, new pesticides are required to pass the active substances test. Then, it is handed to the European Food Safety Authority(EFSA), then transferred to the European Commission (EC). After it passed all the assessments, EU members will perform product checks before the pesticide is recognized as a product fit for commercialization in their country.

China Regulations
What are Biological pesticides(Biopesticides)?
Biological Pesticides are microbial including bacteria, fungi, virus, and genetically modified microbial, in origin.
Requirements
Assessment of product chemistry and hazard to humans and domestic animals are required. Furthermore, the data of the pesticide efficiency and residue chemistry in other countries are also required. The special requirement of microbial is to provide the characteristic of the microbial.

Sustainable agriculture is a global trend.  Many countries are keeping up changing their law in order to build up an eco-friendly farming environment.  However, Taiwan’s law is a little outdated.   Thus, we compare law and regulation of biological control of US, European Union, and China.  Hope to find out which part is Taiwan’ s law needed to take close look of.

According the table above, we suggest that Taiwan’s lawmakers need to be aware of the regulation of “Residue Chemistry” and “advertisement” since there are more than two countries in the world take seriously about these parts.
Let’s search further in law and regulation from those three countries and Union!
