TITLE
Besides the fungal killing switch and the functional prototype that help reduce concerns over GMO
Overview
Oriental fruit fly will make fruit dropped and rotton, that cause serious damage to Taiwan’s cash crop.Because we want to improve existing oriental fruit fly trap, controlling it effectively, we design the pheromone trap and infrared counter with early-warning system, timing adjustment……
Integrated Orchard Safeguard
Overview
In our project, we tried to design a killing switch circuit to make genetically engineered fungus feasible. Despite decreasing the risk and concerns from inside, in prototype, we try to achieve the same goal from the outside. Current method in applying entomogenous fungus are dissolved fungus powder into solution and practice large scale spraying. However, we are dealing with genetically-engineered fungus, the better we implement them, the better to the eco-system, the environment and us.  [In practice, the bait will appeal to the male oriental fruit fly, but it is the female one that is high reproductive and destructive. In our project, we come up with the idea of infect the female oriental fruit fly while mating, and conduct related experiment on mating infection rate. IR counter, another feature of our prototype, record and provide in-time information of the orchard, this can pest group size, and other climatological information include temperature, the humidity…etc. With a smartphone app, we are able to inform the grower.  With a bait trap, a IR counter and a smartphone app, we are bringing the integrated orchard safeguard to iGEM.
Bait Trap
After the bait trap receives the population size of oriental fruit fly from IR counter, it will then automatically regulate the frequency of spraying the fungal solution and the length of the door opening time.

Features
1. Specificity - Methyl Eugenol
Methyl Eugenol is the pheromone precursor of oriental fruit fly. It will only appeal to male oriental fruit fly. The male oriental fruit fly will stop and fly away once they consume enough Methyl Eugenol.
2. Target main Problem – Female Oriental Fruit Fly
A female oriental fruit fly poses more threat than male oriental fruit fly.  [找雲端硬碟裡面東方果實蠅女王說的話]
3. Regulation – IR Counter, Trap, Phone App
Automatically regulation of the frequency and door open duration depending on data from IR counter and phone APP.
4. Eco-Friendly – Recycle
Replacing the indissoluble plastic material (distributed by the government) with recyclable wood chips. It can reduce environmental pollution.
