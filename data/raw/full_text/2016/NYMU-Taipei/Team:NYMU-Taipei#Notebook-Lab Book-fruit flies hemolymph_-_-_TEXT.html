the new way for feeding oriental fruit flies is using gauze to be the windows that could be ventilation, and we can put watered agar and artificial feed on the top of gauze, then there were no water and feed in the box which lead to the environment being mess, and they also could have enough water and feed.

Q&A Section
How to CULTURE oriental fruit flies?
The oriental fruit flies can grow in a transparent large container and centrifuge tubes with a piece of cotton placed at the opening to prevent them from escaping while still allowing air exchange.
Feeding on sucrose-peptone agar (sited by ATCC) when you choose the centrifuge tubes as their living environment; a ratio of composition below is the way to feed the fruit flies in a larger container. The larval need the other formula to grow up whether living in the centrifuge tubes or the larger transparent container. The adult feeding formula without peptone can also alive the oriental fruit flies but not breeding.
Larva formula                                            Adult formula ratio  Yeast extraction 35g                       Sucrose: yeast extraction: peptone  Sucrose   60g                       3:1:1  Oat                  120g  Sodium benzoate 1g  Hydrochloric acid 4.5ml, 37%  Water   450ml
The advantage of cultivating in large container is avoiding the tight space that oriental fruit flies can almost only walk and then causing the growth medium spoil easily. On the other hand, cultivating the fruit flies in the centrifuge tubes can easily distinguish the situation of the oriental fruit flies, for example, gender, health, quantity to take the correct actions.
How to prevent COMTAMINATION?
Adding preservatives, for instance, sodium benzoate, and decreasing environmental humidity can decease the growth of the mold on agar.
Sterilize cotton according common lab procedure or just buy pre-sterilized one.
How do you KEEP the oriental fruit flies in place during experiments?
Using carbon dioxide gas to induce comatose and try your best to contain the gas within the tube and the oriental fruit flies should be unconscious after 10-20 seconds.
Induce coma under low temperature.
How about the methyl eugenol? Are there any suggestions on attracting the male oriental fruit flies or the actual situation that farmer using it to prevent the oriental fruit fly pest?
It is best to complete experiments using methyl eugenol before 2:00 PM.
Several time experiments may cause the male oriental fruit flies became desensitized to methyl eugenol, so it's important to change the sample you test on the experiments routinely to avoid the factor to interfere the result.
The attraction traps putting in the orchard need to add pure and undiluted methyl eugenol to capture the oriental fruit flies. It also needs some cottons or gauzes to separate the oriental fruit flies and methyl eugenol to prevent the chain of fruit flies and eventually causing the death.
It's not a good idea to set the trap when (a) it's a rainy day (b) it's not the harvest season of the guava or tangerine, or the number of the fruit flies captured will not high.

Can the designed M. anisopliae actually invade B. dorsalis?
