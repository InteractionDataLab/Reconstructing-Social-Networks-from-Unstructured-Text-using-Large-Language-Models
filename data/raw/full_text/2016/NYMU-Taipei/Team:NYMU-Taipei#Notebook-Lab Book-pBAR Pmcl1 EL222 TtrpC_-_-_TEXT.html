8/16
pBAR_EL222_TtrpC transformed into competent cells
pBAR_EL222_TtrpC containing cultures used 2 in 1
[Collapse]
8/17
pBAR_EL222_TtrpC extracted and attempted to amplify with plasmid PCR (we did not amplify the target sequence; hence, we tried to ligate again)

C120_minimal PgpdA digested for the ligation with RFP
pBAR_EL222_TtrpC extracted from transformed cultures, checked with restriction digestion and plasmid PCR (failure)
[Collapse]
8/28
pVP-EL222 and TtrpC PCR ran ligation PCR (NC had been contaminated)
pVP-EL222 and TtrpC PCR ran ligation PCR (used remixed primer)
[Collapse]
8/29
pVP-EL222 and TtrpC ran ligation PCR (the concentration was not high enough after gel extraction)
