Validated Part / Validated Contribution
1. Experimentally validate new Bio Bricks Part or Device of our own design and construction works as expected and document the                     characterization of the parts in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part. (BBa_K2040101)
Collaboration
1. We collaborate with NCTU Formosa for pest population prediction website.
2. We collaborate with HSiTAIWAN for model check, provide expertise and plasmid check.
3. We collaborate with TAS TAIWAN for socail research. Click here to see more.

Human Practices
1.We perform detailed interview from fruit growers, researchers and interest group. We also have several outreach1. (這邊我到時候再改)
Gold
Integrated Human Practices
1. Despite interview and outreach, we also develop a social research on the transfer effectiveness of gene-technology related information, the                     outcome is fruitful.                      2. We also develop a pest prediction web for the fruit growers.
Improve a previous part or project
1. We characterized a previously existing part BBa_K1184000 the Killer Red, which have never been tested in iGEM and the science community.

Demonstrate your work
1. The product of our Integrated Orchard Safeguard plays essential role in implementing our fungal solution. With our product, we are able to infect the female oriental fruit fly and prevent large-scale spraying of fungal solution. Click here to see our .
