Overview
Current method of applying entomogenous fungal pesticides is to suspend fungal spores into a solution and introduced through large-scaled spraying. However, with genetically engineered fungi, the contemporary biopesticide deployment method risk damaging the eco-system from the residual fungi. Our project is divided into two main focuses. While our team members in wet lab aim to design a killing switch circuit to decrease the environmental risk of genetically engineered fungus from within the organism. Our prototype team try to avoid the risk of large-scaled pesticide spraying by designing and building an Integrated Orchard Safeguard system centered around our prototype bait trap.
In modern bait traps, the bait only attract B. dorsalis. However, it is female flies that is responsible for the species' high reproductiveness and destructiveness. This is why we designed the bait trap to attract, infect, and release male flies to allow M. anisopliae infection of female flies via copulation. The IR counter, another feature of our prototype, record and provide information including pest population size and meteorological data, such as temperature and humidity. Furthermore, farmers can monitor their orchards with a smartphone app that receives data from the IR counter.
We present the Integrated Orchard Safeguard, a informative defense system that links our bait trap, IR counter, and smartphone app.
Bait Trap
After the bait trap receives the population size of oriental fruit fly from the IR counter, it will then automatically regulate the frequency of the spray of fungal spore solution and the opening duration of the door.
Design
1. The First Layer – Microcontroller, Power
The Arduino UNO in our design has combined with Appsduino's product, AppsBee Shield and Appsduino Shield. (The web site of Appsduino: http://appsduino.com/)
2. The Second Layer – Motor
We use the string attached to a ULN2003 motor to open and close the door.
3. Drawer – Entrance, Atomization Device
Since flying up is one of the behaviors of B. dorsalis, we set the entrance at the bottom of the trap to hinder the escape of trapped flies. The grower can pull out the drawer to refill the methyl eugenol(a pheromone precursor) to maintain the trap's attraction to male flies. The atomization device in the drawer sprays fungal spore solution to infect the trapped male flies.
Features
1. Specificity - Methyl Eugenol
Methyl Eugenol is the pheromone precursor of B. dorsalis. It only attracts male flies. The male flies will fly away once they have consumed enough Methyl Eugenol.
2. Target main Problem – Female Oriental Fruit Fly
female B. dorsalis poses more threat than males.
3. Regulation – IR Counter, Trap, Phone App
Automatically regulation of the spray frequency and door open duration depends on the data collected by the IR counter and phone APP.
4. Eco-Friendly – Recycle
Replacing the indissoluble plastic material (distributed by the government) with recyclable wood chips which can reduce environmental pollution.

IR Counter & APP
IR counter records and provides real-time information of the orchard : pest group size, meteorological data including temperature and humidity. With a smartphone app, the bait traps are able to inform the grower of these important information.
Design
Functional Test
To improve the accuracy of counter, we tried to find the proper tunnel diameter allows only one-by-one passage of B. dorsalis. We prepared different size of straws to connect two centrifuge tubes. One contained male B. dorsalis, and the other contained the bait, methyl eugenol.
Result
Results indicate that when the tunnel diameter is above 0.8 cm, the flies can pass through.

Modeling Efficiency
A population size model of B. dorsalis was constructed to simulate a comparison of B. dorsalis population size between an IOS-protected orchard and a normal orchard. The results show a significant decrease of 35% in B. dorsalis population in an IOS-protected orchard compared to one without IOS. Link to modeling
