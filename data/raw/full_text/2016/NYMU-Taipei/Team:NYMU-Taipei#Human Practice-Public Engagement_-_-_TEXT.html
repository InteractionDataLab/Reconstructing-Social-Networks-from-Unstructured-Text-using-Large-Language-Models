Achievement
Gold
Expand on our silver medal Human Practices activity and demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to our project by hosting a bootcamp for high school students and work with International Cooperation Development Foundation(ICDF) to help control potato diseases in Republic of Honduras. Our policy and practices
Help TAS Taipei , a high-school iGEM team, by debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
We characterized a previously existing inducible promoter J61051 and entered the information in the part's page on the Registry.( BBa_J61051 )
Demonstrate a functional prototype of our project and show that the system working under real-world conditions simulated in the lab. Our functional prototype
Silver
Experimentally validate new BioBricks Part or Device of our own design and construction works as expected and document the characterization of the parts in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device.( BBa_1769009 BBa_K1769002 )
Submit the new parts to the iGEM Parts Registry.( BBa_K1769009 BBa_K1769002 BBa_K1769000 BBa_K1769004
Demonstrate how our team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of our project. Our human practice
Bronze
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Complete the Judging form.
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.( BBa_K1769005 BBa_K1769006 BBa_k1769008 )
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
