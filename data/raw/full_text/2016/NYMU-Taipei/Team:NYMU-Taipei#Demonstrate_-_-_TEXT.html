Integrated Orchard Safeguard
Overview
Current method of applying entomogenous fungal pesticides is large-scaled spraying fungal spore solution. However, deployment of genetically engineered fungal pesticides using contemporary methods puts the local eco-system at risk of disruption by the residual fungi.
Our project is divided into two main focuses to neutralize these risks. While our team members in wet lab aim to design a killing switch circuit to decrease the environmental risk of genetically engineered fungus from within the organism. Our prototype team attempt introduce an alternative to large-scaled spraying of genetically modified biopesticide by designing and building an Integrated Orchard Safeguard system centered around our prototype bait trap.
In modern bait traps, the bait only attract male B. dorsalis. However, it is the females that are responsible for the species' high reproductiveness and destructiveness. This is why we designed the bait trap to attract, infect, and release male flies to allow M. anisopliae infection to spread to the females via copulation with infected males. The IR counter, another feature of our prototype, record and provide information including pest population size and meteorological data, such as temperature and humidity. Furthermore, farmers can monitor their orchards with our smartphone app that receives data from the IR counter.
We present the Integrated Orchard Safeguard, an information network system that connects our bait trap, IR counter and smartphone app together.
New Generation Bait Trap
After the bait trap receives the population size information of B. dorsalis from the IR counter, it will then automatically regulate the frequency of the spray of fungal spore solution and the opening duration of the door.
Design
1. The First Layer – Microcontroller, Power
The Arduino UNO main chip in our design was combined with two additional Appsduino chips, AppsBee Shield and Appsduino Shield. (The web site of Appsduino: http://appsduino.com/)
2. The Second Layer – Motor
We use the string attached to a ULN2003 stepper motor driver to open and close the door.
3. Drawer – Entrance, Atomization Device
Since flying up is one of the behaviors of B. dorsalis, we set the entrance at the bottom of the trap to hinder the escape of trapped flies. The grower can pull out the drawer to refill the methyl eugenol(a pheromone precursor) to maintain the trap's attraction to male flies. The atomization device in the drawer sprays fungal spore solution to infect the trapped male flies.
Features
1. Specificity - Methyl Eugenol
Methyl Eugenol is the pheromone precursor of B. dorsalis. It only attracts male flies. The male flies will fly away once they  have consumed enough Methyl Eugenol.
2. Target main Problem – Female B. dorsalis
Female B. dorsalis poses more threat than males.
3. Regulation – IR Counter, Trap, Phone App
Automatic regulation of the spray frequency and door opening duration depending on the data collected by the IR counter and phone APP.
4. Eco-Friendly – Recycle
Replacing the indissoluble plastic material (distributed by the government) with recyclable wood planks, which can reduce environmental pollution.

IR Counter & APP
IR counter records and provides real-time information of the orchard : pest group size and meteorological data including temperature and humidity. With a smartphone app, the bait traps are able to inform the grower of these important information.

Functional Test
"Diameter of the tunnel that allows passage to one B. dorsalis" & IR counter
To improve the accuracy of counter, we tried to find the proper tunnel diameter allows only one-by-one passage of B. dorsalis. We prepared different size of straws to connect two centrifuge tubes. One contained male B. dorsalis, and the other contained the bait, methyl eugenol.
Result
The results indicate that when the tunnel diameter is above 0.8 cm, the flies can pass through.

Twin Infection Rate experiments
"Infecting B. dorsalis with wildtype M. anisopliae" and "infecting female B. dorsalis by copulation with infected male B. dorsalis" experiments link to each other. This not only confirm the fact that M. anisopliae can infect and eventually kill B. dorsalis, but also a NEW way of biological control through the use of males as infection vectors to infect the females.
The concentration that is the most effective in killing B. dorsalis is 1.6 × 106 (conidia/ ml).
The death rate of female B. dorsalis infected by M. anisopliae via copulation with infected males is 80%.

Modeling Efficiency
A population size model of B. dorsalis was constructed to simulate a comparison of B. dorsalis population size between an IOS-protected orchard and a normal orchard. The results show a significant decrease of 35% in B. dorsalis population in an IOS-protected orchard compared to one without IOS.

Expenditure Analysis
Based on our experimental deployment of counters and traps in an orchard one-hectare in size. The estimated total cost of IOS is listed below:
It is estimated that orchard without any B. dorsalis treatment may incur lost up to 30% of fruit[1]. A few calculation was done based on the data from government, and it shows that the implementation of IOS can reduce the agricultural loss by 25%.
The savings of fruit value is much greater than the cost of IOS, suggesting our IOS is really worthwhile to be implemented.
