✓We collaborate with HSiTAIWAN for model check, provide expertise and plasmid check.
✓We collaborate with TAS TAIWAN for socail research. Click here to see more.
Human Practices
✓In field work, we interview the fruit growers, enterprises, experts and interest group.
✓We compare law and policy on biological control agent.

Human Practices
✓To investigate into education of public, we develop a social research on the transfer effectiveness of gene-technology related information.
✓To really assist the fruit grower, we develop a pest prediction website for the fruit growers.
Improve a previous part or project
✓We characterized previously existing part, including a fungus Terminator BBa_K1021008 , a promoter gpdA BBa_K1021010 , a KillerRed protein BBa_K1184000 , selection marker BBa_K1021003 , and mRFP protein BBa_E1010
Demonstrate your work
✓We successfully demonstrate our product in real world condition that includes a bait trap, a IR counter and a smart phone app.
✓Our pest prediction website works well on the Internet. Visit our website here.
Integrated Human Practice
We want to bridge the science world to the society.
In field work, we visited fruit growers, enterprises, experts and interest group, discovering most control strategies failed because of inability for prediction. Thus, we freshman established a pest prediction website as a forecasting platform. Government researcher thought highly of our effort.
In education, precious iGEM teams presented us with various and intriguing approaches, we are, however, looking for bigger scale of science communication of the society. We developed a social study assessing the transfer effectiveness of gene-technology information. The outcome is so fruitful. We also evaluate the feasibility of World Café as an effective communication for iGEM teams, the outcome is highly positive.                     We also conduct policy study and comparison, host an interschool meetup and educate high school student. We hope what we have done can help further the scope of human practice in iGEM.
