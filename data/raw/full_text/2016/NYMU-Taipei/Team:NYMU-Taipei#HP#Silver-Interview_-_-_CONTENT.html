Abstract:    We interviewed with a lemon grower, who grows his plants in a sustainable and toxin free way.  He makes good use of some easy and efficient gadgets and techniques to manage his land, which we shall share with other farmer for reference. Let’s take a close look how he achieves in this method. </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
Content:    The so called “toxin free agriculture” or “sustainable agriculture” does not mean a complete prohibition to the use of chemical pesticide. The biological pesticide is not efficient as chemical pesticide, thus, we use these chemicals in a proper way. There are several benefits from toxin free agriculture. First of all, we fruit growers can keep ourselves healthy and so can the planet. Secondly, the crops do not contain chemical pesticide. The consumers are more likely to choose these healthy products, which then will increase our income. Since we know how to use the pesticide correctly, we can reduce a great among of cost, which also benefits us a lot.</P><P style="font-size:16px;">    We make fertilizer by ourselves instead of chemical fertilizer.  We mix the used or wasted soybeans, shrimp shell, and other kitchen waste for fermentation.  Then, the fertilizer will spread precisely to the field through the pipe.  This is a simple and helpful design that can save a lot of our money and time.</P><P style="font-size:16px;">     To conclude, our main goal is not to stop using the chemical pesticide or fertilizer but to figure out some alternative ways of growing healthy plants. Furthermore, just by using some smart tools, farmers can easily manage their land, which makes the balance between environment and farmers.</P></DIV><DIV class="thx"><H3 style="margin-top:30px; margin-bottom:10px; line-height: 24px;">End-User Interview 3</H3><P style="font-size:16px;">

                1. What made you decide to run a farm?
A: This is our childhood dream. However, my dad, a school principal himself, doesn’t allow us to run farms at that time. 9 years ago, we were finally able to realize our dream.For we finally got our own time-
            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                2. What’s the reason for organic farming?
A: I used to be a captain in a camp before I became a farmer. Since I had no experience working on earth, I wasn’t familiar with chemicals, so I learned to grow crops in the most natural way. During this process, I gradually got a sense that Nature is a gift that God has given us. As his creation, we are given the authority to regulate the world,  So we need to treat other creatures equally with the same love that God shows us, instead of using pesticides that may damage the environment. Furthermore, we are actually the real victims of pesticides, for we consume all the products we grow. Why should we harm ourselves? 
            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                What are the concerns about organic farming?
A:The most pressing issue is how to deal with pests. Now we are using the most traditional method: pepper spray and handpicking. Sex hormone is a more effective method that’s also in use, but still cannot be compared to pesticides. In addition, if our farm is the only area that doesn’t use chemical pesticides, all the pests will come to our land. Of course we would like everyone to adopt this new way of farming.

            Respondent: Mrs. Xu
            Place: Miyun District, Beijing</P><P>     Mrs. Xu is a local farmer in Miyun District. She grows crops like apple, walnuts and pitaya in her fruit yard…Every year, grave loss were cost by plant diseases and insect pests. She uses pesticides in her farm in order to control the diseases and pests even though she knows it may be harmful to the environment and may affect her body health. We interviewed her for the reasons and details.
        </P><P>     She tried bio-pesticides before however they are not working very well thus bio-pesticides are more precious than chemical pests. She thought about grow her crops in a organic way however that will increase the costs. And for the purchasing price is always lower than one could imagine. When people around you uses chemical pests and you alone try to deal the problems in a biological way, and you hardly got the high earnings, it’s something to concern.
        </P><P>     Mrs. Xu indicates that the society development is also something to concern about when popularize bio pestitudes. When people could accept a higher price of agricultural product, farmers could possibly increase the costs in cultivate. Mrs. Xu is willing to use NYMU-2016’s product if it works better than bio-pesticides and harmless than the chemicals do.

                Place: Kaohsiung District Agricultural Research and Extension Station, COA, EY</P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                Abstract:     We went to Kaohsiung District Agricultural Research and Extension Station to interview Min-Nan Tseng, an expert of <I>Metarhizium anisopliae</I>, and discussed the biosafety issue regarding <I>Metarhizium anisopliae</I>. Moreover, we also talked about the interaction between researchers and farmers, specifically, why, what, and how they help farmers to enhance the farmer’s knowledge and technology on agriculture.
            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                Content:     The wild type <I>Metargizium anisopliae</I> would not harm the environment. However, would it to harm to the environment in the farmland?  This problem is tricky since agriculture is artificial and does not belong to the nature. We might have concerns about eliminating the non-targeted bugs, but we can guarantee that it’s much safer then chemical pesticide.  As long as we use <I>Metarrihizium anisopliae</I> in the right place and time, it would be really effective in dealing with the pest problems.

            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">    We had done many researches on the genetically-modified <I>Metarhizium anisopliae</I> to ensure the biosafety through the following protections.  First, we needed to ensure that <I>Metarhizium anisopliae</I> would not become a pathogen against human beings, so we selected the fungus that could only survive below 37℃(98.6F).  Second, we allowed the experiment conducted in the lab only, and it was well conserved in fear of gene transfer to the wild.
            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">     Nowadays, consumers and farmers pay close attention on the issue of food safety and environment. It’s the best time to promote pollution-free and eco-friendly agricultural methods.  Our job is to educate farmers on implementing pesticide and fertilizer correctly.  Thus, we chose to use <I>Metarrihizium anisopliae</I> because it is not made out of chemistry; it would not harm the land or human.  Another thing we did is to hold a series of events on social education.  It’s the so called “Food and Agriculture Education”(食農教育). The ultimate goal is to teach kids and adults the right way to choose good food and build up relationship towards land. Because we only have one earth, we should leave a healthy planet to our next generation.
            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">     All in all, <I>Metarrihizium anisopliea</I> could play a vital role in toxin free, sustainable, and eco-friendly agriculture in the future.  Moreover, we can let if possible many people to know what importance of having a sustainable agriculture is and how we can do it.

                 Abstract:    <I>Metarihizium anisopliae</I> does not have much safety concerns. However, we still need to pay extra attention when we use it.  Furthermore, the professor believes that education should be taken seriously. Students are encouraged to “do it themselves” in order to know what the end-user is thinking and what the problems they are facing. Liu also mentioned that everyone on this land can do something to support the sustainable and toxin-free agriculture.
             </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                 Content:    We have done integrated researches on <I>Metarihizium anisopliae</I>, so we can ensure that it is safe for human. Moreover, <I>M. anisopliae</I> has already passed the Environmental Impact Assessment(EIA) and is available now on the market.  Nevertheless, <I>M. anisopliae</I> is virulent to Hemiptera such as cicada, silkworm and so on.  We should be careful when using <I>M. anisopliae</I> near the silk industry because silkworm will be easily infected.
             </P><P style="font-size:16px;">     I encourage my students to “do it themselves” during college. In an agriculture technology college, we cannot just lock ourselves up in labs and lose connection to our society.  After connecting to the industry chain, students could understand more about what they are studying. The purpose of education is to bridge the gap between academic and practice.  Thus, we should not lose the connection to society.</P><P style="font-size:16px;">      Last but not least, “Life”,”Environment”, and “Production” will form a golden triangle in agricultural industry.  In the past, the only thing that farmers care about was how to make the best profit.  Thus, the chemical pesticide and fertilizer was overused and done many damages to our land.  Most of the time, we only care about “Production”, so the golden triangle is not balanced. However, people’s attitudes are changing. Not only farmers but consumers started to choose the less damaging way of growing. It is a great thing to see the progress. We can support farmers to make changes in several ways such as technical support, financial subsidy, or just simply, buy their products. Since the sustainable agriculture becomes a trend around the world, we can also help our farmer in Taiwan with this practice!

                Time: 07/12/16
                Respondent: 台灣農村陣線 (Taiwan Rural Front) 秘書處 蕭喬薇</P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                Q&amp;A:</P><P style="font-size:16px;">1.      It seems that the government and the agricultural sector in Taiwan generally have a rather contentious relationship. What may be the cause of that?</P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                A:      The agricultural occupation generally isn’t perceived as an industry. In addition, in this small yet densely populated region, the government has the ability to purchase and acquire farmland through legal means for non-agricultural purposes. Asides from farmers, the intermediaries in the market also play a crucial role in influencing the relationship. Since the Taiwanese government does not implement adequate legal measures to guarantee the rights the agricultural industry, it creates a fragmented relationship.</P><P style="font-size:16px;">
             2.      What contributions has Taiwan Rural Front made to advocate for land rights and changes to the current agricultural measures? We would like to hear your stories.</P><P style="font-size:16px;">
             A:      In 2008, the government issued a reform plan to transform the agricultural industry into one for tourism purposes, although the decision brings little to no benefits to the farmers. For instance, Taipei residents often choose to purchase cheaper land in Yilan to build elite housings or mansions. However, the tall buildings often block out the sunlight, and contaminated water are also not adequately regulated, thereby bringing detrimental consequences to people’s lives and the agricultural industry’s once persistent culture of purity and simplicity. As a result, the rural countryside essentially became a tourist site of little significance behind the urban city. Some people feel that there must be changes to these measures; we believe that those who hold the same belief should voice out their opinion together.
             
            
                When we began to hear the thoughts and hopes of those who are directly involved in the agricultural industry, we decided to create the organization “Taiwan Rural Front”. Through social media and the internet, we bring these issues to light and attract supporters who are involved in different areas of occupations and industries. In addition, we have published some relevant works and communicated with international organizations; we hope that we can make a difference via politics and effective public relations.  </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                3.      In the early ages, we didn’t use chemical fertilizers or pesticides in crop production. Then, there was an evident trend towards an increased use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. However, recently there are more and more farmers shifting their approach towards organic farming. What accounts for these trends and changes in agricultural methods?</P><P style="font-size:16px;">   A:      In the past, farmers faced relatively less food scarcity issues, plus the technology back in the days was not advanced enough to invent chemical fertilizers and pesticides. After World War II, food shortage becomes a common issue, hence it becomes a goal for every country’s researchers to find alternatives to mass-produce crops. The United States, the European countries and Japan all have their own methods to deal with food shortage. During the Green Revolution in the 1960s, government from different countries encouraged farmers to use pesticides and synthetic fertilizer to improve agricultural output. However, with that comes many downsides. In Taiwan, such measures have not only brought harm to the quality of soil, it also increased farmers’ reliance on industrial products, and subsequently they lose their agency and become trapped in a cycle of debts.
            
         
                Recently, more people have returned back to the traditional farming methods, taking soil quality and well-being of the consumers into account. Although the agricultural output is incomparable to that of the mass production, yet it raises the quality of living, and attracts young people to be willing to return back to the agricultural industry. As such, the relationship between land and mankind are gradually improving.
            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                4.      What are your thoughts on genetically modified crops?</P><P style="font-size:16px;">  A:      The agricultural industry, the consumers and the environment are the three essential areas that Taiwan Rural Front focus on.

            
                            How has genetic modification impact the agricultural industry? Genetic modification has a huge implication for the Third World countries. The Monsanto company uses inexpensive and efficient plantation methods to solve food scarcity issues in these countries, and encourage the farmers to use their products. Nonetheless, despite the promising sign of good agricultural output at the start, once the soil fertility worsens, the crop yield decreases significantly. As a result, farmers have to use an even stronger fertilizer; this creates a viscous cycle. How is this different than the agricultural methods used long ago? in the early days, farmers save the left-over seeds and trade the seeds with the other farmers, thereby saving cost. Using the seeds from Monsanto, the cost of cultivating crops not only increases, the diversity and options also become limited. These seeds have no patent, so one cannot use them without approval; this limits the farmers’ agency to manage their own farmland. Hence, in our views on genetic modification, we are concerned with threats posed by monopolistic corporations on the rights and will of the farmers.
            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                5.      As students, what can we do to contribute to the agricultural developments in Taiwan?
            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                A:      To solve an issue, one must first have a good understanding of that area. We hope that teenagers can visit the countryside more frequently and have a more thorough understanding of the farm life. As well, by promoting and advocating our cause, we hope to spread awareness about the importance of our connection to the land. We notice that parents in Taiwan commonly do not wish to have their kids stay in the countryside, most likely as a result of the lack of resources and opportunities when compared to the cities. Moreover, those of the younger generation who move from rural to urban area often lose connection with their home on the countryside. Hence, we will be planning activities and inviting teenagers to talk to the farmers about their work experiences and interesting lifestyle. Perhaps it will successfully convince some to return to the countryside; yet, the agricultural industry doesn’t only involve the famers, it requires the cooperation of people from different fields and studies. Not everyone will decide to return to the agricultural industry, but it is important for all of us, regardless of the field of study we pursue in, to appreciate and be grateful of our homeland.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="prototypeprototype"><DIV class="fund"><DIV class="mango"><H3 style="margin-top:30px; margin-bottom:10px; line-height: 24px;">Fruit grower I</H3><P style="font-size:16px;">Date:07/20/16

First of all, we fruit growers can keep ourselves healthy and so can the planet. Secondly, the crops do not contain chemical pesticide. The consumers are more likely to choose these healthy products, which then will increase our income. Since we know how to use the pesticide correctly, we can reduce a great among of cost, which also benefits us a lot.</P><P style="font-size:16px;">    We make fertilizer by ourselves instead of chemical fertilizer.  We mix the used or wasted soybeans, shrimp shell, and other kitchen waste for fermentation.  Then, the fertilizer will spread precisely to the field through the pipe.  This is a simple and helpful design that can save a lot of our money and time.</P><P style="font-size:16px;">     To conclude, our main goal is not to stop using the chemical pesticide or fertilizer but to figure out some alternative ways of growing healthy plants. Furthermore, just by using some smart tools, farmers can easily manage their land, which makes the balance between environment and farmers.</P></DIV><DIV class="thx"><H3 style="margin-top:30px; margin-bottom:10px; line-height: 24px;">End-User Interview 3</H3><P style="font-size:16px;">

                Abstract:
                We went Nantou to interview with local farm.  Since Nantou is on the mountain side, it would be a lot of thing different than plain.

                1. What made you decide to run a farm?
A: This is our childhood dream. However, my dad, a school principal himself, doesn’t allow us to run farms at that time. 9 years ago, we were finally able to realize our dream.For we finally got our own time-
            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                2. What’s the reason for organic farming?
A: I used to be a captain in a camp before I became a farmer. Since I had no experience working on earth, I wasn’t familiar with chemicals, so I learned to grow crops in the most natural way. During this process, I gradually got a sense that Nature is a gift that God has given us. As his creation, we are given the authority to regulate the world,  So we need to treat other creatures equally with the same love that God shows us, instead of using pesticides that may damage the environment. Furthermore, we are actually the real victims of pesticides, for we consume all the products we grow. Why should we harm ourselves? 
            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                What are the concerns about organic farming?
A:The most pressing issue is how to deal with pests. Now we are using the most traditional method: pepper spray and handpicking. Sex hormone is a more effective method that’s also in use, but still cannot be compared to pesticides. In addition, if our farm is the only area that doesn’t use chemical pesticides, all the pests will come to our land. Of course we would like everyone to adopt this new way of farming.

            Respondent: Mrs. Xu
            Place: Miyun District, Beijing</P><P>     Mrs. Xu is a local farmer in Miyun District. She grows crops like apple, walnuts and pitaya in her fruit yard…Every year, grave loss were cost by plant diseases and insect pests. She uses pesticides in her farm in order to control the diseases and pests even though she knows it may be harmful to the environment and may affect her body health. We interviewed her for the reasons and details.
        </P><P>     She tried bio-pesticides before however they are not working very well thus bio-pesticides are more precious than chemical pests. She thought about grow her crops in a organic way however that will increase the costs. And for the purchasing price is always lower than one could imagine. When people around you uses chemical pests and you alone try to deal the problems in a biological way, and you hardly got the high earnings, it’s something to concern.
        </P><P>     Mrs. Xu indicates that the society development is also something to concern about when popularize bio pestitudes. When people could accept a higher price of agricultural product, farmers could possibly increase the costs in cultivate. Mrs. Xu is willing to use NYMU-2016’s product if it works better than bio-pesticides and harmless than the chemicals do.

                Place: Kaohsiung District Agricultural Research and Extension Station, COA, EY</P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                Abstract:     We went to Kaohsiung District Agricultural Research and Extension Station to interview Min-Nan Tseng, an expert of <I>Metarhizium anisopliae</I>, and discussed the biosafety issue regarding <I>Metarhizium anisopliae</I>. Moreover, we also talked about the interaction between researchers and farmers, specifically, why, what, and how they help farmers to enhance the farmer’s knowledge and technology on agriculture.
            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                Content:     The wild type <I>Metargizium anisopliae</I> would not harm the environment. However, would it to harm to the environment in the farmland?  This problem is tricky since agriculture is artificial and does not belong to the nature. We might have concerns about eliminating the non-targeted bugs, but we can guarantee that it’s much safer then chemical pesticide.  As long as we use <I>Metarrihizium anisopliae</I> in the right place and time, it would be really effective in dealing with the pest problems.

            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">    We had done many researches on the genetically-modified <I>Metarhizium anisopliae</I> to ensure the biosafety through the following protections.  First, we needed to ensure that <I>Metarhizium anisopliae</I> would not become a pathogen against human beings, so we selected the fungus that could only survive below 37℃(98.6F).  Second, we allowed the experiment conducted in the lab only, and it was well conserved in fear of gene transfer to the wild.
            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">     Nowadays, consumers and farmers pay close attention on the issue of food safety and environment. It’s the best time to promote pollution-free and eco-friendly agricultural methods.  Our job is to educate farmers on implementing pesticide and fertilizer correctly.  Thus, we chose to use <I>Metarrihizium anisopliae</I> because it is not made out of chemistry; it would not harm the land or human.  Another thing we did is to hold a series of events on social education.  It’s the so called “Food and Agriculture Education”(食農教育). The ultimate goal is to teach kids and adults the right way to choose good food and build up relationship towards land. Because we only have one earth, we should leave a healthy planet to our next generation.
            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">     All in all, <I>Metarrihizium anisopliea</I> could play a vital role in toxin free, sustainable, and eco-friendly agriculture in the future.  Moreover, we can let if possible many people to know what importance of having a sustainable agriculture is and how we can do it.

                 Place: Meiho University, Pingtung, Taiwan</P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                 Abstract:    <I>Metarihizium anisopliae</I> does not have much safety concerns. However, we still need to pay extra attention when we use it.  Furthermore, the professor believes that education should be taken seriously. Students are encouraged to “do it themselves” in order to know what the end-user is thinking and what the problems they are facing. Liu also mentioned that everyone on this land can do something to support the sustainable and toxin-free agriculture.
             </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                 Content:    We have done integrated researches on <I>Metarihizium anisopliae</I>, so we can ensure that it is safe for human. Moreover, <I>M. anisopliae</I> has already passed the Environmental Impact Assessment(EIA) and is available now on the market.  Nevertheless, <I>M. anisopliae</I> is virulent to Hemiptera such as cicada, silkworm and so on.  We should be careful when using <I>M. anisopliae</I> near the silk industry because silkworm will be easily infected.
             </P><P style="font-size:16px;">     I encourage my students to “do it themselves” during college. In an agriculture technology college, we cannot just lock ourselves up in labs and lose connection to our society.  After connecting to the industry chain, students could understand more about what they are studying. The purpose of education is to bridge the gap between academic and practice.  Thus, we should not lose the connection to society.</P><P style="font-size:16px;">      Last but not least, “Life”,”Environment”, and “Production” will form a golden triangle in agricultural industry.  In the past, the only thing that farmers care about was how to make the best profit.  Thus, the chemical pesticide and fertilizer was overused and done many damages to our land.  Most of the time, we only care about “Production”, so the golden triangle is not balanced. However, people’s attitudes are changing. Not only farmers but consumers started to choose the less damaging way of growing. It is a great thing to see the progress. We can support farmers to make changes in several ways such as technical support, financial subsidy, or just simply, buy their products. Since the sustainable agriculture becomes a trend around the world, we can also help our farmer in Taiwan with this practice!

                Time: 07/12/16
                Respondent: 台灣農村陣線 (Taiwan Rural Front) 秘書處 蕭喬薇</P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                Q&amp;A:</P><P style="font-size:16px;">1.      It seems that the government and the agricultural sector in Taiwan generally have a rather contentious relationship. What may be the cause of that?</P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                A:      The agricultural occupation generally isn’t perceived as an industry. In addition, in this small yet densely populated region, the government has the ability to purchase and acquire farmland through legal means for non-agricultural purposes. Asides from farmers, the intermediaries in the market also play a crucial role in influencing the relationship. Since the Taiwanese government does not implement adequate legal measures to guarantee the rights the agricultural industry, it creates a fragmented relationship.</P><P style="font-size:16px;">
             2.      What contributions has Taiwan Rural Front made to advocate for land rights and changes to the current agricultural measures? We would like to hear your stories.</P><P style="font-size:16px;">
             A:      In 2008, the government issued a reform plan to transform the agricultural industry into one for tourism purposes, although the decision brings little to no benefits to the farmers. For instance, Taipei residents often choose to purchase cheaper land in Yilan to build elite housings or mansions. However, the tall buildings often block out the sunlight, and contaminated water are also not adequately regulated, thereby bringing detrimental consequences to people’s lives and the agricultural industry’s once persistent culture of purity and simplicity. As a result, the rural countryside essentially became a tourist site of little significance behind the urban city. Some people feel that there must be changes to these measures; we believe that those who hold the same belief should voice out their opinion together.
             
            
                When we began to hear the thoughts and hopes of those who are directly involved in the agricultural industry, we decided to create the organization “Taiwan Rural Front”. Through social media and the internet, we bring these issues to light and attract supporters who are involved in different areas of occupations and industries. In addition, we have published some relevant works and communicated with international organizations; we hope that we can make a difference via politics and effective public relations.  </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                3.      In the early ages, we didn’t use chemical fertilizers or pesticides in crop production. Then, there was an evident trend towards an increased use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. However, recently there are more and more farmers shifting their approach towards organic farming. What accounts for these trends and changes in agricultural methods?</P><P style="font-size:16px;">   A:      In the past, farmers faced relatively less food scarcity issues, plus the technology back in the days was not advanced enough to invent chemical fertilizers and pesticides. After World War II, food shortage becomes a common issue, hence it becomes a goal for every country’s researchers to find alternatives to mass-produce crops. The United States, the European countries and Japan all have their own methods to deal with food shortage. During the Green Revolution in the 1960s, government from different countries encouraged farmers to use pesticides and synthetic fertilizer to improve agricultural output. However, with that comes many downsides. In Taiwan, such measures have not only brought harm to the quality of soil, it also increased farmers’ reliance on industrial products, and subsequently they lose their agency and become trapped in a cycle of debts.
            
         
                Recently, more people have returned back to the traditional farming methods, taking soil quality and well-being of the consumers into account. Although the agricultural output is incomparable to that of the mass production, yet it raises the quality of living, and attracts young people to be willing to return back to the agricultural industry. As such, the relationship between land and mankind are gradually improving.
            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                4.      What are your thoughts on genetically modified crops?</P><P style="font-size:16px;">  A:      The agricultural industry, the consumers and the environment are the three essential areas that Taiwan Rural Front focus on.

            
                            How has genetic modification impact the agricultural industry? Genetic modification has a huge implication for the Third World countries. The Monsanto company uses inexpensive and efficient plantation methods to solve food scarcity issues in these countries, and encourage the farmers to use their products. Nonetheless, despite the promising sign of good agricultural output at the start, once the soil fertility worsens, the crop yield decreases significantly. As a result, farmers have to use an even stronger fertilizer; this creates a viscous cycle. How is this different than the agricultural methods used long ago? in the early days, farmers save the left-over seeds and trade the seeds with the other farmers, thereby saving cost. Using the seeds from Monsanto, the cost of cultivating crops not only increases, the diversity and options also become limited. These seeds have no patent, so one cannot use them without approval; this limits the farmers’ agency to manage their own farmland. Hence, in our views on genetic modification, we are concerned with threats posed by monopolistic corporations on the rights and will of the farmers.
            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                5.      As students, what can we do to contribute to the agricultural developments in Taiwan?
            </P><P style="font-size:16px;">
                A:      To solve an issue, one must first have a good understanding of that area. We hope that teenagers can visit the countryside more frequently and have a more thorough understanding of the farm life. As well, by promoting and advocating our cause, we hope to spread awareness about the importance of our connection to the land. We notice that parents in Taiwan commonly do not wish to have their kids stay in the countryside, most likely as a result of the lack of resources and opportunities when compared to the cities. Moreover, those of the younger generation who move from rural to urban area often lose connection with their home on the countryside. Hence, we will be planning activities and inviting teenagers to talk to the farmers about their work experiences and interesting lifestyle. Perhaps it will successfully convince some to return to the countryside; yet, the agricultural industry doesn’t only involve the famers, it requires the cooperation of people from different fields and studies. Not everyone will decide to return to the agricultural industry, but it is important for all of us, regardless of the field of study we pursue in, to appreciate and be grateful of our homeland.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
