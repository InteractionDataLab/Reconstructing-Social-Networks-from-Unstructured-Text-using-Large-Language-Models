Team Instructors
Professor Chang always gives ideas that only takes time and patients to understand. He likes to take picture whenever we stay up late, trying to capture each and everyone of us when we are working the hardest. We still do not understand why he acts like that. He gave us great encouragement and always back us up. The 2016 NYMU iGEM team is not complete without him.
Dr. Chang trained us to do iGEM experiments, and she always has immense patience to help us and teach us. Even though we were troublemakers sometimes, she was still willing to give us good advice and let us try out various experiments. During those experimental times, we are really grateful to her for all her great help and care. She takes care us like our mother but sometimes herself a cute little girl. She always encourages us to never give up and help us in any way she can. Without her we never could have gotten this far.
Professor Tsai is insightful and thoughtful. She is usually very busy, but always finds time for us to give critical and insightful comments. As the instructor of our human practice section, she always encourages us to try new things to human practice to a whole new level.
Words cannot describe how awesome Mr. Clapper is. He always comes to the meeting room with big smile. Though we usually speak Chinese in the meeting, he still pays attention to every last detail of our discussions and put our thoughtful ideas and words of encouragement when ever it is necessary. We owe him a great deal for his suggestions to our circuit design and many other aspects of our project. We cannot thank him enough for the contributions he had made to our team.
