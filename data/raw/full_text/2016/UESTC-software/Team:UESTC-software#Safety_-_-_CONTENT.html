There is <B>no</B> direct safety issue related with the use of the software. We also ensure that the encoded DNA sequences as<B> artificial</B> as possible, which means that the encoded sequences are devoid of any actual biological function. The information safety is protected through <B>encryption</B> and the data integrity is ensured through <B>redundancy</B> and <B>error checking algorithm</B>. </P><STRONG>      Q1: <B>What function</B> does your software have? </STRONG><P><B>A1:</B> Bio101 is used to transform computer files to DNA sequences which can be used to synthesize DNA samples for physical data write-in. Our software also provides the decoding function to recover the stored information from DNA samples using the sequencing technology for physical read-out.</P><STRONG>      Q2: <B>Who</B> will use your software?</STRONG><P><B>A2:</B> People who want to store information in DNA will use our software.</P><STRONG>      Q3: How do you <B>verify the results</B> that your software runs? Are they right?</STRONG><P><B>A3:</B> Bio101 has been tested internally and externally. We and our collaborators carried out a series software tests from its <B>usability and stability</B> and the results were documented in a detailed testing report. In addition, we went through the whole process of DNA information storage. We used our software to encode a file and used the result to synthesize DNA samples. After a few weeks’ storage and cultivation, we extracted the DNA samples and sequence them. Finally, Bio101 is used to decode the DNA sequences. As a result, we recovered our original file.</P><STRONG>      Q4: Does it have any<B> risk</B> in laboratory? </STRONG><P><B>A4:</B> The software itself runs on a computer as a <B>web-app</B>. It has no any direct risk associated with the running of the software. The encoding algorithm ensures that the resulting sequences do not contain any biologically functional segment or dangerous part. This has been tested through <B>blasting</B> against known gene sequences. Therefore, it is safe to use and it does not cause any pollution to our environment either. </P><STRONG>      Q5: Does it have any <B>risk</B> in people who use your software? </STRONG><P><B>A5:</B> No, it has no any direct harm to our environment. The encoded DNA sequences are randomized (and encrypted) using the ISAAC algorithm.  It is extremely unlikely to find a sequence with a specific function, not to mention any harm to our environment.</P><H2 id="Bio2048">Bio2048</H2><P>As an edutainment mobile device game, Bio2048 combines the entertainment factor behind the slide-block game 2048 with the biological hierarchy knowledge. It targets young video game players with interest in biology. There is virtually no safety issue to the players other than the harm to the eye-sight related with the prolonged usage of mobile devices.</P><STRONG>      Q1: If your product is successful, who will receive <B>benefits</B> and who will be harmed?</STRONG><P><B>A1:</B> The young people who play the game properly in their spare time will benefit. The young people who spend all their spare time in playing the game may have their eyes harmed.</P><STRONG>      Q2: Where will your product be used? Can it cause <B>pollution</B>?</STRONG><P><B>A2:</B> It can be used at any place where the use of mobile devices, e.g. mobile phones and pad computers, is allowed. It does not cause any pollution directly.</P><STRONG>      Q3：Does your software <B>open source</B>? </STRONG><P><B>A3:</B> Yes, the game is <B>open-sourced</B>.  </P><STRONG>      Q4: <B>Who</B> will use your product?</STRONG><P><B>A4:</B> Our target players are <B>young students</B> but anybody, who is willing to play it to understand a range of important biological concepts in a more interesting way, can play the game. In particular, teachers and parents may use it to teach children on the <B>basic biological hierarchy concepts</B>.</P><STRONG>      Q5: Does it have some <B>risks in health</B> of people?</STRONG><P><B>A5:</B> Bio2048 is an android-OS based <B>video game</B> which can be installed on android smart phones and pads. If people play the game for too much time, their eyesight may be hurt.</P><STRONG>      Q6: Does it have some<B> risks of environment</B> (From the wasting water or others)?</STRONG><P><B>A6:</B> As a video game, there is<B> no danger</B> to our environment in any direct way.</P></DIV><FOOTER class="footer"><DIV class="footer-top"><P>FOLLOW US：
