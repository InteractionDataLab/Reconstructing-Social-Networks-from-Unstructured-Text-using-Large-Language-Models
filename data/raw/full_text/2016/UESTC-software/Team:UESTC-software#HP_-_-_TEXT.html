Human Practices
UESTC-Software members got the spirits of iGEM and completed the competition. We try our best to connect
our work with more people, more targeted groups, to integrate their ideas, inspirations to draw a clear and realistic blueprint.
Silver
Our software has good influence on science progress, we want to expand the influence to society through human practices, which centered on public engagement, public perception and education. We have built a bridge between our lab and the public. Having bi-directional effects on our team and the public is what our human practices really want.
Gold
Human Practices is necessary for the birth of a project; also, what we did should be given back to human practices. With such idea, we have investigated the human practices into the design and execution of our project, Bio101 and Bio2048.
Integrated Practices
We are competing for the Best Integrated Human Practice. We collected feedback from public on the idea of DNA information storage which are vital input to our final design of Bio101. For the edutainment video game, Bio2048, was modified according to the feedback from education aspect. It received 5-star evaluation on the Tencent’s app store.
Engagement
We are competing for the Best Education and Public Engagement. The past summer, we developed an edutainment game Bio2048, and organized 3 large public engagement activities. In addition, we gave almost 200 street interviews and opened a Sina’s micro-blog with 1034 followers, which were the source of the statistics of our survey results.
