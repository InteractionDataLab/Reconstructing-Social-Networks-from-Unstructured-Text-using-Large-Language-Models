In the past summer, fifteen members of the iGEM UESTC-Software team worked together to achieve our goal, to develop a biological information storage system. During the process, every one made an effort to go beyond the set goal. Moreover, the team’s success is not only a result of the concerted contribution of all members and but also due to the generous help from many other people.
