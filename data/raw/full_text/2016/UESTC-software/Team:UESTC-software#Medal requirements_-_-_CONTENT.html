Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams's exemplary work).</STRONG><UL><LI>(1) We developed an <B>edutainment video game</B>,<B> Bio2048</B>, for young children to learn biological hierarch concepts. </LI><LI>(2) We gave a <B>popular science lecture</B> to students from Puyang Middle School to promote their interests in the science behind DNA information storage technology and synthetic biology in general.</LI><LI>(3) We organized an<B> open-lab day event </B>for primary school students.

Improve the function OR characterization of an existing iGEM project (that your team did not originally create) and display your achievement on your wiki.  </STRONG><P>DNA information storage is a promising direction of Synthetic Biology, there were some scientists and iGEM teams that had opened the way for us. One was<B> CUHK’s</B> project<A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Hong_Kong-CUHK" style="color:#3dbec6;" target="_blank"> (https://2010.igem.org/Team:Hong_Kong-CUHK )</A>in 2010. Their system aims to store text information into DNA. We appreciate their achievements, but there are some limitations in their solutions.</P><UL><LI> (1) It can only transform <B>text files</B>.</LI><LI> (2) There are too many <B>homopolymers </B>(i.e., repeated consecutive bases or repeated bases fragment, such as AAAAAA or TACTTACTTACT) in the encoded DNA sequences.</LI><LI> (3) It does not provide an appropriate<B> error correction component</B> in their system. If a small part of the encoded DNA sequences goes wrong, its influence is deadly for the whole system.</LI></UL><P>Our system<B> solved</B> these problems. The comparison between the two projects are given in Table 1. In addition, we proposed a <B>DNA editing protocol</B> based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system.</P><P>Please see the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:UESTC-software/Features" style="color:#3dbec6;" target="_blank">Features </A>page for more details.</P><P class="img-p" style="font-size: 13px;"><B>Table.1.</B> The comparison of two projects</P><STRONG><B style="color:#DB0909;font-size:25px;">√</B> 3.Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab).</STRONG><P><A href="http://bio101.uestc.edu.cn/transform/" style="color:#3dbec6;" target="_blank">Bio101 </A>has been tested internally and externally. We and our collaborators carried out a series software tests from its<B> usability and stability</B> and the results were documented in a detailed testing report. The distributions of A, G, C, T and higher-order combinations of the nucleotides are similar and homopolymers are rare. We also use<B> massive</B> data to test limit of homopolymers the max number eleven and the most of the longest competitive bases between eight to ten. To identify fault tolerance capacity, we damage artificially the encoded sequences by deletion, insertion, and replacement. But we can still <B>recover the information successfully</B>. </P><P>In addition, we went through the whole process of DNA information storage. We used our software to encode a file and the DNA sequences were synthesized by a specialized company (General Biosystems Company, Anhui, China). After a few weeks’ storage and cultivation, we extracted the DNA samples and they were sequenced by a specialized company (Qingkezixi Biotechnology Company, Chengdu, China). Finally, Bio101 was used to decode the DNA sequences. As a result, we recovered our original file. </P><P>Please see the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:UESTC-software/Proof" style="color:#3dbec6;" target="_blank">Proof</A> page for more details.</P><STRONG><B style="color:#DB0909;font-size:25px;">√</B> 4.Bring your prototype or other work to the Giant Jamboree and demonstrate it to iGEMers and judges in your track showcase (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab).</STRONG><P> We will demonstrate how <A href="http://bio101.uestc.edu.cn/transform/" target="_blank" style="color:#3dbec6;">Bio101</A> and<A href="http://sj.qq.com/myapp/detail.htm?apkName=com.mx.igem2048" target="_blank" style="color:#3dbec6;"> Bio2048 </A>work at the Giant Jamboree!</P><P>Please see the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:UESTC-software/Demonstrate" style="color:#3dbec6;" target="_blank">Results</A> page for more details.</P></DIV><FOOTER class="footer"><DIV class="footer-top"><P>FOLLOW US：
