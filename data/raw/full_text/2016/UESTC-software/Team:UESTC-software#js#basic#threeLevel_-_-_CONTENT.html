                '<P>Living in an era of information explosion, digital production, transmission and storage so far have not only revolutionized the way information is accessed and used, but have made archiving of information an increasingly complex task <SUP>[1]</SUP>. Have you been perplexed by vast quantities of information? And have you ever  imagine that there exists a practical, high-capacity, low-maintenance, and even self-copy information storage medium which would be still useful after thousands of years? It wouldn’t be only a dreamy illusion anymore because of the appearance of great DNA storage technology.</P>' +
                '<P class="img-p" style="font-size:13px;">&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;<B>Fig.1.</B> Genome controls the growth and development of human being.</P>'+
                '<P>DNA, one of the most miraculous masterpiece created by Nature as the stable genetic material, hold a great promise for high-density, long-term and massive information storage. For example, human genome, just 3 billion base pairs, contains all of the complex biology information of human being, including metabolism, development, production and many other functions  <B>(Figure 1)</B>. Why do not we utilize DNA to store information? Researches indicate that it is extremely dense, and spectacular high-capacity with a raw limit of 1 exabyte/mm<SUP>3</SUP>(10<SUP>9</SUP> GB/mm<SUP>3</SUP>)<SUP>[2]</SUP>. In other word, every gram of DNA is equivalent to 14 thousand of 50GB blue-ray discs 233 x 3 TB hard disks with a weight of more than 151 kg. Meanwhile, compared with now routinely used information storage media, DNA can be stored up to thousands of years and still readable <B>(Figure 2)</B><SUP>[2]</SUP>. Grass R N, et al developed an innovative preservation of digital information on DNA which presumably can last 1 million years in silica<SUP>[3]</SUP>. In conclusion, DNA with a great number of virtues in information storage makes it an ideal archival material.</P>'+
                '<P class="img-p" style="font-size:13px;">&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;<B>Fig.2.</B>  DNA storage as the bottom level of the storage hierarchy.<SUP>[2]</SUP></P>'+
                '<H2 id="Biotechnology_Availability"><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Biotechnology_Availability">Biotechnology Availability</SPAN></H2>'+
                '<P>You may wonder how a piece of arbitrary information is stored into DNA molecules . It owes to the development of DNA sequencing <B>(Figure 3)</B> and synthesis technologies which make it possible to archive and read data in DNA. In 1977, Frederick Sanger adopted primer-extension strategy to develop the DNA sequencing method &quot;DNA sequencing with chain-terminating inhibitors&quot;<SUP>[4]</SUP>, and it directly facilitated human genome project <B>(HGP)</B>. But Sanger method is too expensive and takes too long time, such that HGP project spent 3 billion dollars over fifteen years<SUP>[5]</SUP>. Untill next-generation sequencing <B>(NGS)</B>, also named high-throughput sequencing, technologies generated, the cost of vast sequencing became comprehensive and really acceptable. 454 pyrosequencing<SUP>[6]</SUP>, illumina (Solexa) sequencing<SUP>[7]</SUP>, SOLiD sequencing<SUP>[8]</SUP> are three mainly applied popular methods. Meanwhile the third generation nanopore DNA sequencing has appeared<SUP>[9]</SUP>. Owing to technology development, sequencing cost per genome exponential decrease from 1 million dollars in 2008 to just 1 thousand now<SUP>[10]</SUP>. Encouragingly, the cost will keep dropping, and sequencing would  become as simple as reading information from a hard disk or compact optical disk.</P>'+
                '<P class="img-p" style="font-size:13px;">&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;<B>Fig.3.</B>  The history of DNA sequencing technology progress.</P>'+
                '<P>On the other read, writing information physically into DNA molecules depends on the chemical synthesis of artificial DNA sequences. Currently, chemical synthesis of short nucleic acids has been extensively used as primer, probe and so on. The process is implemented as solid-phase synthesis using phosphoramidite method<SUP>[11]</SUP> and phosphoramidite building blocks derived from protected 2’-deoxynucleosides (dA, dC, dG, and T), ribonucleosides (A, C, G, and U), or chemically modified nucleosides.  <B>(Figure 4)</B>.  Regrettably, we still can’t easily synthesize longish DNA segments or some possessing special second structures or high GC-content now. Although oligonucleotide synthesis has been proposed very early in 1955<SUP>[12]</SUP>,  DNA synthesis is much expensive than sequencing, even innovative DNA synthesis company Twist Bioscience still costs 0.04 cent of every base while just 1 cent in reading 1 million bases.</P>'+
                '<P class="img-p" style="font-size:13px;">&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;<B>Fig.4.</B>  Synthetic cycle for preparation of oligonucleotides by phosphoramidite method<SUP>[13]</SUP>.</P>'+
                '<P>Considering the above situation, notwithstanding current DNA storage demand a large of investment that per megabyte were estimated at $12,400 to encode data and $220 for retrieval<SUP>[14]</SUP>. It is already accessible for us. What we need to care is how to design the connection between DNA sequence and digital information. In our project we develop an innovative software Bio101 to solve the problem.</P>'+
                '<H2 id="Project_abstract"><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Project_abstract">Project abstract</SPAN></H2>'+
                '<P>Towards creating a platform for information storage in synthesized DNA, our team built the user-friendly website tool Bio101 for transformation between DNA sequences and computer files. We replace ternary transformation process<SUP>[14]</SUP> into quaternary system to accelerate the code speed in order to fulfill demand of web-app. Meanwhile, we still keep the randomness of DNA sequences to avoid functional gene segments.</P>'+
                '<P class="img-p" style="font-size:13px;">&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;<B>Fig.5.</B>  The design of Bio101 for transformation between DNA sequences and computer files.</P>'+
                '<P>There are five steps in this process including compression, encryption, bit-to-nt conversion, indexing and validation. <B>(Fig.5)</B> This coding tool can create a convenient DNA information workflow, so researchers can choose any files they want and focus on synthesizing DNA. The surprisingly simple idea has the potential to reshape the global face of data storage in the not-too-distant future, and our work contributes to practical areas can accelerate the step to success.</P>'+
               '<P>Responding to demand of information edit, new module of system introduces CRS-9’s proposal  for segment substitution. Since former design regards and scrambles whole files as whole, it’s necessary to reorder our workflow, put fragmenting into the first step, here is our new design:</P>'+
               '<P>New design provides independence to every segment, therefore CRS-9 could target it and destroy it in theory without influencing other information.Even thought, new process reduces power of encryption, we still keep randomness.</P>'+
               '<P>First version is for data archiving, and second one is for data edit. First one collects and utilizes experience from past, and the second one looks forward  and embrace future.</P>'+

We choose bzip2 to compress file. In consideration of a good information storage system, encrypting the message is essential. So after compression process, we use a fast cryptographic random number generator(ISAAC) to encrypt the compressed file to minimize the safety cases so as to keep the information secret. Then, we need to transform the binary numbers to DNA sequences. In order to store various large pieces of information, we fragment the long DNA sequence into pieces and add each new sequence address code and check code, which help to rebuild the sequence with errors.</P>' +

For instance, base pair, DNA, protein, organelle, cell, tissue, organ, system, individual, population, community, ecosystem, biosphere, these are important concepts in biology. The distance between ordinary people and those is so long that they nearly cannot touch it. Therefore, it’s imperative to spread the biological knowledge of the mass then to improve the quality of life.</P>'+

</PRE>
                '<P>In order to popularize biological knowledge and draw the public’s attention to biology from the basic level, UESTC-Software decided to adopt a more acceptant way to make more people be aware of the subject. We developed an Android game named Bio2048 based on the Grabriele Cirulli’s “2048”, a popular sliding block puzzle game. Instead of the numbers, the blocks are labeled with some common biological patterns, such as gene and protein. All the patterns form a biological ladder. If two patterns with the same biological terms collide while moving, they will merge into one pattern with a new biological term which moves up by one on the biological ladder.</P>'+

We took the core into our design and choose 12 elements: basic group, DNA, protein, organoid, cell, tissue, organic, system, individual, population, community, ecosystem, biosphere, to replace numbers. Besides, we hoped the game interface more three-dimensional, it may have some Chinese elements to get close with users and enrich itself. When those ideas came together, we created the game——Bio2048.</P>'+

There is a wide range of people in community, including people from different industries and people of all ages. So community is a certain representative place to do propaganda. In the meantime, we took forms of posters publicity and leaflets distribution to exert more profound and durable influence on the masses; we interviewed passersby to directly learn about the level of people’s understanding of synthetic biology and change their wrong views. In order to increase the scope of publicity and improve the credibility of the results of the interviews, our footsteps are around every corner in Chengdu.

As we believed that students in primary and middle school are the most people in need to receive some basic education about biology and synthetic biology we paid attention to holding the lecture and activity to arouse their interest in science. In the lecture, we showed synthetic biology and iGEM with stories and videos to more than 200 students in Puyang Junior High School. We built plasmids with functions we wanted together. </P>'+

                '<P>For many people, biology is a subject that they are unfamiliar with. In society, People lack the mediums to contact with biology. Biology is separate from ordinary people’s life. We decided to adopt a more acceptable way to make more people touch it directly. So, we combined the conceptions of biology with the well-known game-2048.</P>'+

                '<P>During the period that we learned and thought about our project, we considered to take some actions to seek inspiration. We hold a lecture with UESTC-China in Puyang Junior High School. We introduced synthetic biology with some well-known examples at first. Then, it was time for the students to build their own plasmids. They added the functional genes like Bioluminescence gene into the plasmids. So the plasmids carried the information of the light emitting gene. “The plasmid carried the information of biological characteristics” inspired us: was DNA able to carry a wide variety of information? Along this idea, we explored the DNA information storage.</P>'+

                '<P>When we were designing our software, we hoped the idea would come from the public. After all, the final software achievement will return to life. We did street interviews, from campus to market. We wanted to hear the voice of the public’s imagination to the DNA information storage system. In surprise, we received many useful information from the communication. A young man’s opinion left the deepest impression on us: he nearly had higher expectation for the storage capacity, equipment volume and storage speed. He had special interest in our project and gave us great help to decide the property and function of software.  </P>'+

                '<P>According to various interviews, in fact, most people generally believed something related to synthetic biology is dangerous. So they did not eat genetically modified food as far as possible. We introduced simply about synthetic biology and tried to eliminate their mistakes. Obviously, not all of people can accept us. But we will continue to make efforts to correct the  thinking of public.</P>'+
                '<P>From the lecture, students knew more about synthetic biology and are all more interested in biology. Creating plasmids by their own hands makes the technology easily understood. Then the activity let children feel biology more directly through doing experiment by themselves. We remember one boy said that experiment is untouchable in ordinary life, today he felt cool and excited. This is what we want to achieve. The activity changed the stereotyped images of biology, and it becomes vivid in masses’ eyes. Young children are new-rising force of our country. Letting them realize the great development prospect and arousing their interests in biology are significant to continue biology studies.</P>'+

Many people made comments after trying, and most said that the game was attractive for the combination of knowledge and enjoyment. Some thought that our game was lack of description words, therefore, we added introductions to build a learning mode in the game for easier understanding.</P>'+

Teachers are surprised to see that it isn’t only a kind of edutainment but also an integration of math and biology. In the activity, “To Be Scientists Tomorrow”, we held a Bio2048 game. A parent, as a biology teacher, was delighted in Bio2048, and she thought it was very educational and necessary to be introduced and used in class. Surely, it was a recognition of our work and we are trying our best to realize the idea.
