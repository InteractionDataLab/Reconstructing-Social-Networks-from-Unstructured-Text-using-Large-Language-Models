Our aim is to circularize the TAL-effector so the proteins are solid during the purification. To do this we use the vector construct of the iGem team of Heidelberg in 2014 that has an  Intein  mechanism (more information at https://2014.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg ). However, we changed a part of the Intein sequence because we wanted to optimize and stabilize the circulation. Another change was made on  the repeat side of the TALE- we did into the vector of the team in Heidelberg. If you want to read more about our project concept click here Project.
We designed four circularized vectors with the help of the Heidelberg teamâ€™s mechanism and our own linker. All of them contain the TAL-effector sequence, the Strep Tag, the TEV side and the Intein sequence, a special TAL-effector sequence. This is so that they can bind to another DNA sequence. Additionally, two of them contain a GFP sequence.
