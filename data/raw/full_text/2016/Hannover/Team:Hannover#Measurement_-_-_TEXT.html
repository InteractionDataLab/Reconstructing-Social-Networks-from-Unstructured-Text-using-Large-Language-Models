Model
Measurement
There are a lot of exciting Parts in the Registry, but many Parts have still not been characterized. Synthetic Biology needs great measurement approaches for characterizing new parts, and efficient new methods for characterizing many parts at once. If you've done something exciting in the area of Measurement, describe it here!
Inspiration
