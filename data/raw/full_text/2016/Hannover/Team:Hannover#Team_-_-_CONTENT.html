This year, we are 12 highly motivated undergraduate and graduate students from very different fields of study: Biology, Life Sciences, Plant Biotechnology and even Computer Science.  We all share a common interest in synthetic biology and passion for our project. This competition is the perfect opportunity to expand our horizons and use our theoretic knowledge in the lab. Since we have very different fields of study, we had a basic course about TALE proteins and biotechnology itself. Dr. Reinard provided the computer science students with some tutoring in biology. 

But let us introduce ourselves:

Thereby, I hope to expand my abilities in the areas of project management, lab work, sponsoring and presentation.

				&quot;The possibility of a competition like iGEM, already working independently on a project and organizing a team as a student, has made me curious.

			&quot;I like about iGEM that we get the possibility to broaden our horizon and work in other fields e.g. sponsoring.

			&quot;The participation in the iGEM competition represents an exceptional possibility that complements our usual studies. To organize such a project self-dependently from the beginning and present it in front of a technically demanding, international audience is, also as a view beyond our own horizons, a possibility which does not arise too frequently.
