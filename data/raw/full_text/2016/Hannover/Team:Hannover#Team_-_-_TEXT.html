Our Team
In this page we introduce our team members, student leaders, and advisors.
We are the second iGEM team from the Leibniz University Hanover and got together in September 2015.  This year, we are 12 highly motivated undergraduate and graduate students from very different fields of study: Biology, Life Sciences, Plant Biotechnology and even Computer Science.  We all share a common interest in synthetic biology and passion for our project. This competition is the perfect opportunity to expand our horizons and use our theoretic knowledge in the lab. Since we have very different fields of study, we had a basic course about TALE proteins and biotechnology itself. Dr. Reinard provided the computer science students with some tutoring in biology.
But let us introduce ourselves:
Our TEAMMATES and ADVISORS
Teammate: Severin Hachenberg
BS biology
Task: Sponsoring and Lab work
"I am a biology student and am excited for the unique chance that we are offered: independently develop and execute a project in an interdisciplinary team."
Teammate: Ann-Katrin Hannemann, B.Sc.
MS computer science
Task: Web Admin, Software Development and design
"I want to take part in the iGEM competition to gain experience for my future professional life. As a computer scientist, I will work in interdisciplinary teams frequently and transfer demands of customers with other background knowledge. Besides, I want to get an insight into other areas like life sciences or biology and I’m interested in how a scientific competition and its preparations take place."
Teammate: Wiebke Jünemann
BS life science
Task: Sponsoring, Lab work and PR
"In my opinion, the iGEM competition is very exciting, because our team independently develops and executes a molecular-biological project. Thereby, I hope to expand my abilities in the areas of project management, lab work, sponsoring and presentation. Additionally, I’m looking forward to the teamwork and the new challenges which allow us to gain new experiences for our future professional lives."
Teammate: Sabine Klatt
BS life science
Task: Lab work and PR/Collaborations
"The possibility of a competition like iGEM, already working independently on a project and organizing a team as a student, has made me curious. I think that by participating in the competition I can learn a lot for the future."
Teammate: Kim Lühmann
MS plant biotechnology
Task: Lab work
“Working for the iGEM competition is a new challenge I want to manage. In addition, I hope that I can gain more knowledge about teamwork and depiction in a project we need to improve independently.”
Teammate: Bianca Naumann, B.Sc.
MS plant biotechnology
Task: Safety and Lab work
"For the iGEM competition, we need to organize ourselves and work together interdisciplinary. This is a unique opportunity to develop a project together and take over responsibility."
Teammate: Louise Schaar
BS life science
Task: Sponsoring and Lab work
"I like about iGEM that we get the possibility to broaden our horizon and work in other fields e.g. sponsoring. Besides, we are given the opportunity of an international exchange with other students, maybe the only one during our years of study. In addition, the project requires independent work and we are provided an insight into a future working life."
Teammate: Janis Schleusner, B.Sc.
MS plant biotechnology
Task: Lab work
"The participation in the iGEM competition represents an exceptional possibility that complements our usual studies. To organize such a project self-dependently from the beginning and present it in front of a technically demanding, international audience is, also as a view beyond our own horizons, a possibility which does not arise too frequently. I also expect to establish new contacts and learn new skills."
Teammate: Theresa Schmidt
BS life science
Task: Lab work and PR/Collaborations
"In my mind, the diverse experiences I can collect in the iGEM competition are going to help achieve future goals. In addition, it is fun to work self-dependently in an interdisciplinary and determined team."
Teammate: Martin Singer, B.Sc.
MS computer science
Task: Modelling and Software Development
"At iGEM, I have the option to expand my technical knowledge and my soft skills. This is not only interesting for my future career, but is also a pleasant challenge."
Teammate: Arthur Ulmann, M.Sc.
BS biology
Task: Design
"The variety of biology inspires me. To be a part of the iGEM team gives me the opportunity to be creatively involved in a scientific project."
Teammate: Roman Zimbelmann, B.Sc.
MS computer science
Task: Modelling and Software Development
“I am a computer scientist, but very interested in biotechnology. Actually, I wanted to study bioinformatics and iGEM offers the excellent opportunity to work with a multisided team in which we complement each other and compensate our weaknesses.”
