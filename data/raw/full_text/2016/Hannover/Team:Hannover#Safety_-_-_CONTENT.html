One way this is done is through autoclaving the trash before disposal. </P><P>Our aim is to produce an enhanced protein. A potential environmental risk comes from the cyclic TALE, which only binds to the target dsDNA. The application depends on the user, for example, a TALE with a nuclease. This TALEN cuts the predicted sequence and should not be taken outside the lab. Therefore our project aims to a much higher safety level than it is possible nowadays. </P><H2>Safe Lab Work</H2><P>Before the lab work started, every member of the team got a safety instruction from one of our advisors, Dr. Thomas Reinard. This included general instructions on how to work and behave in a lab, as well as rules to keep the lab clean (lab service). Additionally, he pointed out the location of safety-related objects (such as eye showers, first aid kit etc.), instructions on how to use lab equipment (such as centrifuges, heaters, fume hoods etc.) and, how to properly handle dangerous substances. Lastly, we were taught the record requirement for GMOs, and given a list of rules. </P><P>For example we are not to be left working unattended , that is to say at least one advisor has to be present. We must inform someone if we are going to be unusually late and lastly we the possible dangers for expectant mothers were explained to us. </P><P>Our team is comprised of students from different study paths, so only those members who were already trained worked in the lab. To protect ourselves and avoid contamination, we always wear safety goggles, gloves and a closed lab coat and shoes. </P><P>Our lab has been ranked level 1 in biosafety. The organisms we use are the <I>Escherichia Coli</I> strains TOP10, DH5α, BL21 (DE3) and Origami B (DE3). They are all classified in Risk Group 1 in biosafety guidelines. The vector we are using is the same as the shipment, pSB1C3 .If we work with these strains or use liquid nitrogen to store our samples, we are always using thermo-insulating gloves, Dewar vessels and glasses to prevent any risks. </P><P>The gels for the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis are prepared and run on a separate working place. After this, we dispose of our old gloves and get new ones. Working with genetically modified organisms always contains a risk and, although our experiments are not dangerous, we always work in accordance with the biosafety guidelines of our institution and the government: </P><DIV class="panel-group" id="accordion"><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><SPAN style="cursor:pointer" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseGenTSV"><H4 class="panel-title"><A>1.
