pipets work well
assembly of TALEs
we cloned three different constructs in TALEs and transformed them into E.coli: 1) R-SCTALEN left HA Tag 2) R-TALEN left HA Tag 3) R-TALEN right myc Tag
isolation of plasmids
We isolated the two plasmids 1) iGEM20? and 2) pET 32a+?  out of E.coli with a QIAprep(R) Spin Miniprep Kit. The concentrations were 1) 354 ng/ µl and 2) 43.5 ng/ µl dsDNA measured with a NanoPhotometer
