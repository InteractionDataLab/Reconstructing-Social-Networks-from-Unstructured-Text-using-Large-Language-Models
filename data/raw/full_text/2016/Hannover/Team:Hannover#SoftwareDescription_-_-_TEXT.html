InterLab Study
Description
This year, our team consisted not only of biology or biotechnology students, but also computer science students. Therefore, we had the opportunity to design and program software and a platform.
First, we aimed to simplify the organization of an iGEM team by modifying a platform to share ideas, files, and knowledge.
Secondly, we also designed a spotter program to specifically place oligonucleotides that will visualize a picture upon specific binding of a GFP-tagged TALE.
Moreover, we programmed software to automatically design and synthesize TALEs for their desired application. Combined with a pipetting robot, this software can be used to design new TALE sequences without much effort. Like this, the usage of TALEs is easy and quicker than CRISPR/Cas9.
Originated out of our project, we do think that our software can improve lab work in general and help not only teams in the competition, but also researchers in the lab.
Sponsors
Our project would not have been possible without financial support from multiple sponsors and supporters.
