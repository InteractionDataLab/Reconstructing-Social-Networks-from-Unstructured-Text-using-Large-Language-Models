Humans often claim to be the king of Earth. In fact, the tiny bacteria is the real leading role behind                 the scenes manipulation. Nobody knows how many bacteria there are in the life.                 As for the benefits and hazards of bacteria, people know poorly about them. In order to let us learn                 more about knowledge of the biology.

The invisible life
We show the usual living in the air of bacteria, through the naked eye to observe, in fact, there are bacteria                 everywhere. In order not to let people feel fear, we deliberately used bacteria painting on media, full of                 artistic breath, and to show that these tiny lives. At the same time, we respectively coated bacteria to the                 resistant and not resistant medium, to spread the huge role of antibiotics.
Micro world
In our eyes, there is always a flaw in the world. We have specially borrowed a microscope and some organ                 sections from the teaching experiment center, which has aroused public concern. Whether adults or                 children are deeply attracted by the microscopic world. In the activity, we have attracted the                 attention of biological researchers. They listened carefully to the knowledge about the synthetic                 biology and the iGEM contest.
PH of water
Water is the source of life. We can't live without water. The water we drink in our lives is weakly                 acidic or weakly basic? We all don't know. So we show people the pH of the bottled water in life,                 through a simple experiment.
