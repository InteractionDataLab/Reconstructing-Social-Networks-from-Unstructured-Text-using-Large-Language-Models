                                According to our design, we transfected a targeting plasmid into <I>E.coli BL21</I> to express fusion protein composed of the protein tCas9 and CIBN. Simultaneously, we transfected GFP, gRNA and CRY2-VP64 plasmid into <I>E.coli BL21</I>. Then, the promoter of GFP were continually repressed by gRNA and tCas9. When exposed to blue light, the N-terminal fragment of CIB1 (CIBN) would interact with CRY2. Subsequently, binding of the CRY2-VP64 on the upstream sequence of promoter will result in activating promoter via recruitment of the RNA polymerase II by the VP64 subunit of CRY2-VP64. Generally, the experimental procedure can be divided into four steps:

                                With different target loci have been tested by the usage of a GFP reporter plasmid (pCold-1) with a CSPA promotor. The target sites can be determined by directing the gRNA consisting of 20 bp length against the desired sequence of interest. F1 gRNA with target sites at different distances to the promotor regions proved successfully as potential activation sites (see Table 1 and Figure 5).

                                Compared with control groups, green fluorescence intensity and mRNA levels were dramatically reduced in groups treated with gRNA and tCas9-CIBN. These results suggest that gRNA can specifically guide tCas9 to target upstream of CSPA promoter, thereby to inhibit CSPA promoter to reduce GFP expression levels.

                                Spatially controlled activation of gene expression was achieved in strains co-transfected with the LACE system, a reporter vector containing a gRNA target sequence upstream of CSPA promoter and the eGFP gene. Strains transfected with light-activated CRISPR/Cas9 effector (LACE) and incubated in the dark did not show a significant difference in eGFP levels compared to control groups transfected with empty plasmid. Strains containing the LACE system and gRNA exhibited significantly brighter eGFP fluorescence intensity when illuminated compared to when incubated in the dark. Activation of the eGFP reporter in strains transfected with the gRNA and LACE constructs, the gRNA and tCas9-VP64 expression plasmid or an empty plasmid as a negative control was quantified after 24 hours of illumination or incubation in the dark.

                                The LACE system provides a straightforward and robust optogenetic method to regulate the expression of endogenous genes using the CRISPR/tCas9 system. When co-transfected with gRNAs into <I>E.coli</I> that are stimulated with blue light, LACE produces a high level of transcriptional activation, in some cases, comparable to those observed with tCas9-VP64.
