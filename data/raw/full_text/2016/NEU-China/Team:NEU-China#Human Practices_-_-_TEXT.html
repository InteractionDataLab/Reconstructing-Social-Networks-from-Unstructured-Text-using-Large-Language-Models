Investigate the biology of public interest
In summer we do a lot of synthetic biology experiments, and how to let the public to                                 participate in us? We have done a series of activities for this. We first collect the                                 issues of public interest by the way of street survey (Click to Download) and online                                 questionnaire.
Finally, we collected 308 questionnaires and made the following statistics.
Figure 1: data description
Public little understand about synthetic biology, even if the staff engaged in biological work is not deep understanding of this.
At the same time, according to the data, the public is more interested in the issue of genetically modified foods, antibiotics, artificial organs, these three aspects. We will use the opportunity to get back to the street and promote our project.
Feedback and Propaganda

Long-term environmental protection activity
We set up a recycling area in the teaching building. Used for long term recovery of drugs and used batteries. A button battery discarded in nature, can pollute 600 thousand liters of water, equivalent to a person's life with water, and China consumes such battery 7 billion. Made a contribution to environmental protection.
