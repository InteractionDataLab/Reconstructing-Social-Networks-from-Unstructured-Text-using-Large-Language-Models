Protocal:
Extract the plant RNA:
Method: Plant RNA kit,E.Z.N.A.® Plant RNA Kit Standard Protocol
Collect tissue in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and freeze by dipping in liquid nitrogen. Grind the tissue using disposable pestles.

RT-PCR
Method:GoScript Reverse Transcription System
Protocal:
microcentrifuge the reagents of kit
Prepare mix A as follows:
RNA: x ul ,make sure the RNA content is up to 1ug/ul.
oligdT: 1 ul
dNTP: 1 ul
DEPC water: (8-x) ul
Total: 10 ul
Incubate mix A for 5 minutes at 70℃ in PCR machine. Then, set on the ice for 5min.
Prepare mix B as follows:
MgCl2: 2ul
DEPC water: 1.6ul
GoScript: 4ul (5x Reaction Buffer)
NucMix: 1ul
RNase: 0.4ul
RTE: 1ul
Total: 10ul
Add mix B to mix A. Set PCR procedure:
25℃ 5minutes → 42℃ 60minutes → 70℃ 15minutes → 4℃ ∞
Insert PCR tube with mixed system into PCR machine, store at -20℃。
Standard PCR Protocal:
Add DNA template up to 50ng into PCR tube,(x ul).
Add reagents as follow:
dNTP: 4ul
5x PSBuffer: 10ul
Primer: 1ul (after diluted)
Enzyme: 0.5ul
ddH2O: (33.5-x)ul
Total: 50ul
Mix gently by vortex and briefly centrifuge to collect all components to the bottom of the tube.
PCR procedure:
98℃(2min)→ 98℃(10s)→55℃(5s)→72℃(1Kb/min)→72℃(5min)→4℃(∞)
The amplification parameters will vary depending on the primers and the thermal cycler used. It may be necessary to optimize the system for individual primers, template, and thermal cycler.
PCR purification：
Method:Cycle-Pure Kit(200)
Perform agarose gel/ethidium bromide electrophoresis to analyze PCR product.
Determine the volume of the PCR reaction. Transfer the sample into a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube and add 4-5 volumes of Buffer CP. For PCR products smaller than 200bp, add 6 volumes of Buffer CP.
Vortex thoroughly to mix. Briefly spin the tube to collect any drops from the inside of the lid.
Place a HiBind DNA Mini Column into a provided 2 ml collection tube.
Add the mixed sample from step 3 to the HiBind DNA Mini Column and centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 1 minute at room temperature. Discard the flow-through liquid and place the HiBind DNA Mini Column back into the same collection tube.
Add 700µl of DNA Wash Buffer and centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through liquid and place the HiBind DNA Mini Column back into the same collection tube.
Add 500µl of DNA Wash Buffer and centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through liquid and place the HiBind DNA Mini Column back into the same collection tube.

Place the HiBind DNA Mini column into a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube. Depending on the desire concentration of the final product, add 30-50 µl of Elution Buffer (10mM Tris, pH8.5) or water directly onto the center of column matrix.
OVERLAP PCR:
order two primers which are complements of one another.
These primers will each have a 60°C Tm with one part and a 60°C Tm with the other part.
The "end primers" will not have any complements and will likely only have restriction sites.
PCR amplify the necessary fragments separately. Use a proofreading polymerase enzyme. Use an annealing temp of 60°C.
Clean up the product using a DNA column.
"Overlap PCR" Use cleaned up fragments as template in a PCR reaction:
About 1/2 to 3/4 volume of the Overlap PCR reaction should be equimolar amounts of purified fragments. Do not use Phusion polymerase. Try Pfu Turbo. Do not add any primers; the templates will prime each-other. 3.Run 15 PCR cycles without primers.Use an annealing temp of 60°C.
Add end primers to the Overlap PCR reaction: Continue cycling for another 15-20 rounds. Use an annealing temp of 72°C
Gel extract the correct size fragment.
