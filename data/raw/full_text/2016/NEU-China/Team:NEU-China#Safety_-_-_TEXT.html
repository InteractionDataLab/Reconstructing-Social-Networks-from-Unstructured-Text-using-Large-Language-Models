Q3. What is the Safety Level of your lab?
Level 1 (low risk)
Q4. Which work areas do you use to handle biological materials?
Open bench, biosafety cabinet / laminar flow hood and chemical fume hood.
Q5. a) Have your team members received any safety training yet?
Yes, we have already received safety training.
Q5. b) Please briefly describe the topics that you learned about (or will learn about) in your safety training.
We learned about the regulations of laboratory safety of our institution, standard experimental protocols, how to use the equipments correctly, identification of a variety of chemical reagents, how to deal with microorganism correctly, etc.
Q5. c) Who provided your safety training? Did you get training from multiple people? (For example: university biosafety office, your team PIs/instructors, etc.)
Our team advisors and instructors. Because we are performing experiments in professor Ding's lab, students who work there can guide us if we meet acoross some troubles. We also have had some certain courses teached by different teachers about biosafety ever before since we all major in bioengineering.
Q6. Who is responsible for the safety of biology labs at your institution? What are the guidelines for laboratory biosafety? Please give a link to these guidelines, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.
Zhanyou Wang who is the vice president of our college (College of Life Science and Health, Northeastern Universtiy). Here are some guidelines of laboratory safety regulations:
Every students should consciously abide by the  laboratory disciplines and safeguard the order of the laboratory.
Must carefully prepare before experiments, familiar with the purpose of this experiment, principle, operation steps, Understand the significance of each operation steps and understand the use of instruments, otherwise you can't start the experiment.
Experim ental mesa should be clean and tidy, and instruments, medicines should be placed neatly. Common reagents should be covered tightly in place immediately after used up. Don't make the reagents, and drug sprinkled on experimental mesa. You are not be allowed to leave the laboratory untill you clean the mesa and ensure all the instruments are turned off.
Waste liquid will be poured into the water tank with water at the same time. Must use strong acid, strong alkali solution diluted by water. Waste paper and other solid waste can be throwed into a cylinder which can be dealt after experiment. Don't throw Into the sink or throw everywhere.
To achieve sterilization, open uv lamp for 30 to 60 minutes in sterile room space for 30 to 60 minutes.
Check the equipment, must be separately sterilized before moving in sterile room.
Dress white coats, sterile working clothes, gloves.
You have to sterilize your hands before the operation in aseptic environment .
Movements should be light and not too fast to avoid pollution. Move glasses softly in order to avoid damage.
Must operate in accordance with the relevant provisions of sterile operation.
All discharges of discarded reagents and microbial must be treated as harmless.
If you are uncomfortable in the process of experiment, immediately stop experiment.
Pay attention during animal feeding, wear work clothes and gloves, if you are bitten, go to hospital immediately.
Laboratory medicine can not be medical use and shall not be eaten.
Q7. In your country / region, what are the laws and regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories? Please give a link to these regulations, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.
Here are some links to regulations concerning biosafety in research laboratories in China:
