Design
Generally, the project design can be divided into two portions:
CRISPR/Cas9system
LACE system
CRISPR/Cas9 gRNA Design
With different target loci have been tested by the usage of a GFP reporter plasmid (pCold-1) with a CSPA promotor. The target sites can be determined by directing the gRNA consisting of 20 bp length against the desired sequence of interest. F2 gRNA with target sites at different distances to the promotor regions proved successfully as potential activation sites (see Table 1 and Figure 1).

LACE system
Optogenetic systems enable precise spatial and temporal control of cell behavior. We                                 engineered a light-activated CRISPR/Cas9 effector (LACE) system that induces                                 transcription of endogenous genes in the presence of blue light. This was accomplished                                 by fusing the light-inducible heterodimerizing proteins CRY2 and CIB1 to a                                 transactivation domain and the catalytically inactive tCas9, respectively. The versatile LACE system can be easily directed to new DNA sequences for the dynamic regulation of endogenous genes.
To regulate DNA transcription by blue light, the system is based on CRY2/CIBN interaction                                 in which a light-mediated protein interaction brings together two protein (tCas9 and an                                 activation domain VP64). If we remove the stimulation of blue light, dark reversion of                                 CRY2 will dissociate the interaction with CIBN and shut off transcription.

tCas9-CIBN (Prokaryotic LACE system)
The NEU-China iGEM team 2016 designed a fusion protein consisting of tCas9 and CIBN for                                 sequence-specific transactivation of a desired target locus (more information). We used                                 our double truncated tCas9 ( BBa_K1982001 ) impaired in its cleavage activity and fused                                 it to the CIBN ( BBa_K1982003 ). An prokaryotic RBS sequence from the Community                                 collection ( BBa_B0034 ) fused to the beginning of tCas9-CIBN. For detection of expression                                 the fusion protein was tagged with a HA-epitope coding sequence ( BBa_K1150016 ) .
Figure 3: Construct design
tCas9 was fused to CIBN. The resulting fusion construct was flanked by RBS sequences                                 and tagged by a HA epitope. The pBad/araC promoter and rrnB T1 terminator were chosen                                 to control gene expression.
CRY2-VP64(Prokaryotic LACE system)
We used the full-length CRY2 ( BBa_K1982002 ) and fused it to the transcription activator domain VP64 ( BBa_K1982012 ). An prokaryotic RBS sequence from the Community collection(BBa_B0034) fused to the beginning of CRY2-VP64. For detection of expression the fusion protein was tagged with a FLAG-epitope coding sequence (gactacaaggacgacgacgacaaa).

tCas9-Vp64(optogenetic control)
To address these limitations, we adapted the CRISPR/Cas9 activator system for                                 optogenetic control. We constructed tCas9-VP64 chimeric constructs gene with an                                 prokaryotic RBS sequence from the Community collection(BBa_B0034). For detection of                                 expression the fusion protein was tagged with a FLAG-epitope coding sequence                                 (gactacaaggacgacgacgacaaa).
