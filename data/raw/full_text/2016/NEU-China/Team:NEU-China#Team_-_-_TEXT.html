My name is Zexu Li and I'm a junior undergraduate from Northeastern                                             University, majoring in bioengineering. I participating in NEU-China 2016                                             iGEM. My primary projects were color oscillator design and  team                                             management. I am very interested in molecular biology and will potentially                                             do a Master of Research in it.

She is very passionate about reaserch,                                             especially about nuroscience. Besides biology, she also loves playing                                             ping pong and swimming. Her motto is “Once you have a dream, never give                                             it up easily.

His work is to construct the light-inducible gene activated                                             plasmid and to test the function of the most of parts came from the                                             different ways. He is one of the core members of the team. Being interested                                             in the field of gene editing, he wants to study and share ideas with other                                             iGEMer during this competition. It has always been his wathwords that keep                                             on denying until you prove it right.

My duty was collecting the reference and data of experiments and                                             confirming the goal of the project. At same time, I offered to help my                                              teammate doing experiment at the early stage, and we solved many                                             peoblems duaring the experiment. I like to play games and read novels,                                             and I really hope to became a scientist. My motto is "The good seaman                                             is known in bad weather".

I dealed with some pre-experiments at the early stage of                                             the project. Later, I participated in the discuss on how to adapt our                                             findings to normol life effectively, which turned out to be the most vital                                             part of the whole project. Simultaneously, I offered to do some translation                                             from wiki pages for my teammates.

My name is Jin Tan, I am good at searching for different kinds of messages,                                             so i am mainly in charge of collecting and interpreting the info about iGEM.                                             Over the past one year, I look through the wiki homepages of many iGEM teams,                                             Learn their design ideas, and get our own inspiration. To introduce myself,                                             I am a introverted person, I like biology, but also willing to devote most                                             of their time to this work on, and I thought fine, of all kinds of                                             information of particularly high sensitivity, resulting in I to the                                             surrounding environment changes particularly keen. I especially love a word,                                             now want to share with you: Nothing is difficult in the world if you put                                             your heart into it.

My name is Hu Yuru, a number of our team which is working on this genetic                                             project. Our experiment is divided into many stages, my teammates                                             jointly conducted preliminary experiments to collect and exchange                                             information, before the start of the experiment, we discussed together                                             with the experimental feasibility analysis of experimental research                                             directions. I am a typical Aries, frank, optimistic, not afraid of                                             difficulties. Known to us, the process of biological research is full                                             of fun, but this process is also accompanied by failures and many times                                             of repetitions. In my submission, getting the desired results in many                                             failures, finding an interesting phenomenon, is the biological charm.

We are the undergraduate team from the Northeastern University (NEU).                             Founded in April 1923, NEU is one of the prestigious universities in China, boasting its                             rich cultural deposit and glorious patriotic tradition. In its history of more than 90 years,                             by keeping pace with the national development and rejuvenation, NEU has been following its                             motto of “seeking unremitting self-improvement, and integrating knowledge and action”. And                             we are part of  college of life and health science. It has five research institute and the                             three public service platform, and establishing modern teaching experiment center and                             perfect teaching and scientific research, management and service system.
In the process of the whole project, we use the laboratory of professor Ding in                             NEOROSSCIENCE INSTITUTE. We also used the research  lab of DING for the procedures                             that requires advances machines and apparatuses.
