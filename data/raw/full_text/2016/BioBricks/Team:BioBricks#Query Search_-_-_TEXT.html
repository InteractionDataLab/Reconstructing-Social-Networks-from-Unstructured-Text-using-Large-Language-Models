Performing a query search for your gene on Web of Science, Scopus, or Google Scholar
The query search helps one navigate through existing literature to determine whether a gene of interest is compatible with your system by finding already-cited issues of toxicity.  Using boolean logic in well known scientific search engines, one can quickly find relevant papers to a specific pathway.

Query Search Terms
Search terms related to toxicity (e.g. "no growth", "cell death", "toxic*"), can quickly whittle down the number of papers to read through when trying to determine whether or not a gene is compatible with your system.
Search Engines
Google Scholar
Query: (("no growth" OR "inhibited growth" OR "low growth rate" OR "cell death" OR "lysis" OR "apoptosis" OR toxic*) AND "Pathway to check" AND “Your organism”))
Web of Sceince
Query: (("no growth" OR "inhibited growth" OR "low growth rate" OR "cell death" OR "lysis" OR "apoptosis" OR toxic*) AND "Pathway to check" AND “Your organism”))
