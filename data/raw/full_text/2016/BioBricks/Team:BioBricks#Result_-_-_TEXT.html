Results: It seems that the ribosome binding site that was calculated and created by EMOPEC work inconsistently. Both genes are not expressing at the expected levels. Also, all growth curves show decreased growth over time, when compared to the control. Even with the decreased growth, both fluorescent proteins were expressed and visualized through a plate reader. CFP, the first gene, did not consistently express at the same level as the control. RFP, the second gene, also did not express consistently at the same level as the control.
Future Plans: We plan to introduce an inducible system into the daisy chain, to allow for more control over the genes of interest. There is a limit in how large of a plasmid that bacteria can take in, so we want to test the size limit of both the plasmid that contains the daisy chain and the size and number of genes that the daisy chain can operate with. The plasmid we used have a colEI vector in it and we want to change the copy number of the plasmid to see how low can go, in terms of plasmid number, and still be able to detect a signal from the daisy chain. Since we want to try and receive the lowest possible signal, we also want try using different media to remove some background fluorescence.
