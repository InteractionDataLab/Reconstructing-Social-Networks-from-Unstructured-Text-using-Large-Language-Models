HUMAN PRACTICES
When our team first got together, we were tasked to do something “Amazing.” Although we were initially troubled because the field of synthetic biology is far-reaching, we decided to look to the future. We saw a future where the world's population was fed, production of energy and manufacturing processes left a positive footprint, and people lived healthier lives. Most importantly, we saw synthetic biology accessible to just about anyone and fast development circles due to large collaboration projects. The future will start now with the Build-A-Cell project.
We identified two user needs in regards to the Build a cell project: First a simple and intuitive educational guide detailing how to build modules and second a tutorial for how to check potential 3rd party rights infringements.
Using the described toolset of expression guide and reliable cassettes, people can be trained fast how to construct new modules, have a higher success rate in expressing their genes and can thus join the project with little knowledge and basic lab equipment.
As we foresee many submissions of modules and potential 3rd party right issues if shared with the community, we created a tutorial which is guiding the user through a fast check to get a first indication whether he has freedom to operate. Completing the 3rd party check ensures transparency about potential infringements and reduces the risks of reusing shared modules.
