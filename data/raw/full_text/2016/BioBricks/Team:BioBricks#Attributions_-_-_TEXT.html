Acknolwedgements
Drew Endy, PhD. The original motivation for this project came from Dr. Drew Endy's vision to propagate synthetic biology worldwide.  We believe the reason that this is not reality is that individual researchers do not have the common language and tools to effectively collaborate with one another to achieve the most ambitious projects.  Thus, Dr. Endy provided us with guidance in moving forward to further develop the tools and the functional standards required to propel bioengineering into the future.
Endy Lab We would also like to specially thank the Endy Lab for helping us to establish protocols and troubleshoot when problems arose.
BioBricks Foundation We would like to thank the BioBricks Foundation for funding this project and giving us this opportunity to participate in the 2016 iGEM Jamboree
