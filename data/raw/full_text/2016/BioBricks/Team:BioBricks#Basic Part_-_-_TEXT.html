This is the basic setup of our Daisy Chain parts...
BBa_K2133000 - 15% RBS
BBa_K2133001 - 40% RBS
BBa_K2133002 - 80% RBS
BBa_K2133003 - RFP-CFP
In this construction we use the ptrc* promoter with a double terminator. We also use a high expression BCD (BCD5).
For parts BBa_K2133000, BBa_K2133001, and BBa_K2133002, we used mTurquoise2 as the first Gene of Interest, and mCherry as the second. Within the first GOI, we embedded the Ribosome Binding Sites, utilizing codon degeneracy through EMOPEC. These sites differed in strengths: 15%, 40%, and 80% consecutively
For part BBa_K2133004, we switched the genes such that mCherry was the first gene, and mTurquoise2 was the second gene.
