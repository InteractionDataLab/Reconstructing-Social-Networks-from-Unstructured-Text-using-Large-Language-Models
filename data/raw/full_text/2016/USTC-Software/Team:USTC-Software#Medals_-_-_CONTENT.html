								Q1. Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
							</H3><P>
								A1. We surely had a great summer. We travelled to Taiwan and Shanghai, had dinners together, played video games together, and fixed bugs together. We are preparing to have a wonderful Halloween at the Giant Jamboree.
							</P><H3>
								Q2. Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page (section 3), except those that specifically mention parts.
							</H3><P>
								A2. All required deliverables are satisfied. We filled in all required forms and we are going to give a fantastic presentation at the Giant Jamboree.
							</P><H3>
								Q3. Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
							</H3><P>
								A3. We have noted attributions fully and accurately on our <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:USTC-Software/Attributions">Attributions page</A>.
							</P><H3>
								Q4. Document at least one new substantial contribution to the iGEM community that showcases a project made with BioBricks. This contribution should be equivalent in difficulty to making and submitting a BioBrick part.
							</H3><P>
								A4. Our software is made powerful for users to advance their works or projects in biology, it supports BioBricks searching and exporting to SBOL file format. Our <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:USTC-Software/Description">Description page</A> briefly introduces our achievement and you can jump to other relative pages if you want more details.
							</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row ar1" id="Silver" data-magellan-target="Silver"><DIV class="column small-12 large-12 ar0 textcontainer"><H1><A href="#Silver">Silver(All Satisfied)</A></H1><H3>
								Q1. Validate that something you created (art &amp; design, hardware, software, etc) performs its intended function. Provide thorough documentation of this validation on your team wiki.
							</H3><P>
								A1. The details of validations are shown on our <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:USTC-Software/Proof">Proof page</A>. We have papers and experimental data supporting our results. Besides, unit-testing ensures that our software performs its intended functions.
								
								P.S. We eventually decided to combine our validations and proofs together in one page since we thought that it should be better to describe our work rather than a stiff split.
							</P><H3>
								Q2. Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synthetic biology problem.
							</H3><P>							A2. As long as we were receiving bounteous assistance from others, we did not forget to pay back and transmit our forces as we can. Our <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:USTC-Software/Collaborations">Collaborations page</A> elaborates on our aid to other teams.
							</P><H3>
								Q3. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. (See the Human Practices Hub for more information.)
							</H3><P>
								A3. We agreed the importance of human practices. See our <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:USTC-Software/HumanPractices">Human Practices page</A> for more details.
							</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row ar2" id="Gold" data-magellan-target="Gold"><DIV class="column small-12 large-12 ar0 textcontainer"><H1><A href="#Gold">Gold(All Satisfied)</A></H1><H3>
								Q1. Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
								</H3><P>
								A1. It is a vain attempt of doing human practices only but not integrating the results into real work. See our <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:USTC-Software/HumanPractices">Human Practices page</A> for more details.
							</P><H3>
								Q2. Improve the function OR characterization of an existing iGEM project (that your team did not originally create) and display your achievement on your wiki.
							</H3><P>
								A2. Our project is based on the Biopano, which is the work of the team USTC-Software in 2014. We displayed our progresses here in our <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:USTC-Software/Description">Description page</A>.
							</P><H3>
								Q3. Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab.)
							</H3><P>
								A3. We give each module an example on our <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:USTC-Software/Proof">Proof page</A> so as for users and viewers to comprehend the usages and functions of our software.
								
								P.S. We eventually decided to combine our validations and proofs together in one page since we thought that it should be better to describe our work rather than a stiff split.
							</P><H3>
								Q4. Bring your prototype or other work to the Giant Jamboree and demonstrate it to iGEMers and judges in your track showcase. (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab.)
							</H3><P>
								A4. We will give demonstration on the Giant Jamboree with our strongest enthusiasm. You can click to our <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:USTC-Software/Description">Description page</A> to get to know about our project in advance.
