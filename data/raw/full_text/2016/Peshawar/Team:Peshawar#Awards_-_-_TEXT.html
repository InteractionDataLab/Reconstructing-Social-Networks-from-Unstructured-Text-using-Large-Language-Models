Awards
From the standard track awards, our team can be nominated for the "Best Environment Project." The project encompasses detecting the harmful gases (CO and oxides of NO) from vehicle exhausts using a portable, cheap, and easy–to–use strip test. Because vehicles contribute a major portion to air pollution, the project can help eliminate such vehicles form the society thus giving us all a chance to breathe cleaner air.
Additionally, considering the diverse track of special prizes, the team can also be nominated for the following prizes:
Best educational and public engagement ( Link )
Best Integrated Practices ( Link )
Best Model ( Link )
Best Wiki ( Link )
