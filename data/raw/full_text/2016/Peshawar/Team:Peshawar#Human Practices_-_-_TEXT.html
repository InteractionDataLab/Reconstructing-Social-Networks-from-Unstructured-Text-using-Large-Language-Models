Human Practices Summary
Being the first ever iGEM team from Pakistan, it was up to us to engage and educate as many people as we could about this brand new science. We ran a synbio roadshow where our team travelled to schools and colleges all across Pakistan and conducted SynBio workshops engaging students, teachers and parents. Our workshops had a 'design—your—device' activity, that also led us to develop a whole new 'BioBrick trading cards' game for younger children. Along with this, we bridged the gap between the lab and society through our public survey.
We were featured on 4 national TV channels, 5 national newspapers, and 1 international biotech website. Through our strong social media presence we reached an astounding number of people not just in Pakistan but all over the world. We also wrote a policy paper for the government that containes recommendations for the developement of Synthetic Biology in Pakistan and the impact it could have not only on our science and education, but also on Pakstan's economy.
