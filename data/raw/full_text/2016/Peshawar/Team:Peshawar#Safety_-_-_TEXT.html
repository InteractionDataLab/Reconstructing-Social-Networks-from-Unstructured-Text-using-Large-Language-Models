Safety
Welcome to our safety page! Here you can learn about how we keep our project, our lab, ourselves, and the outside world safe while doing some really cool SynBio.
Project Safety
We are working on a bacterial biosensor for detecting levels of carbon monoxide and nitric oxide in vehicle exhaust fumes. Our device is meant to be used to outside the lab in a real world setting, but since we are currently focused on the actual sensing circuit aspect more than the device design, we have not included any kill-switch yet (we did start designing a Kill–Box which is discussed below). However, even while in the lab, our project does pose some risks and these are discussed below.
Our Chassis
For our chassis we are using NEB's 5–alpha Competent E.coli (high efficiency) cells which are a derivative of the K12 strain and not a dangerous substance or mixture according to the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) .
Since this is a lab strain and a K12 derivative, it is non–pathogenic and genetically crippled to the extent that it cannot survive outside a controlled environment. Even if it were to somehow escape the lab, it would not survive.
Our Parts
Even if the bacteria somehow survived outside the lab, the risks are very small. The E.coli strain is debilitated: it does not even have the ability to colonize the mammalian gut. We are not using any other whole organism. The plasmids we are using might get into other strains of bacteria by horizontal gene transfer. These strains of bacteria could potentially survive outside the lab. However, none of the parts we are using are pathogenic, though the plasmids have antibiotic resistance genes.
Malicious Use
Our organism, device and all parts are non-pathogenic, so they cannot be used maliciously in anyway.
Kill–Box
Our product was intended to be in the form of a strip. We introduced a kill-switch to our product design so as to have a control over horizontal gene transfer. Our new design, incorporates a box having 2 sections, one in which the strip having the engineered bacteria will be placed in the nutrient media,while bacterial killers in the other section. The strip can be used several times until the media get expired. The twister in the middle can help breaking the wall in between them, degrading the engineered bacteria.
Lab Safety
About our lab
Our lab is a newly constructed Biosafety Level 2 lab which conforms to the international biosafety guidelines. It is a secured area equipped with an ante–room (buffer zone) and magnetically sealed doors with electronic identification system allowing access only to the approved personnel with biosafety training. Anything that goes out of or comes inside the lab is strictly regulated. No materials can leave the lab without first going through a safety and security check. Our institute enforces WHO biosafety guidelines, more specifically Laboratory Biosafety Manual - Third Edition , as well as our Governmental safety guidelines .
Lab Safety Training
Before we started work, we received extensive lab safety training from our PI, Dr. Faisal F. Khan and Coordinator Adil Salim. The training covered risk assessment of the agents in use, and identification, management, and disposal of biological and chemical hazardous waste. We were taught the proper use of biosafety cabinets and other lab equipment. The team was briefed about common laboratory-acquired infections and necessary precautions to take as well as decontamination, sterilization and safe disposal of waste.
Practices
Throughout our project we have been following safe lab practices as trained. All work is done while wearing a fully buttoned lab-coat, closed toe shoes and nitrile-coated gloves at all times.
Microbiology
Good microbiological practices were followed; all work with bacterial cultures and plates was done in the Bio–Safety cabinet. Our incubator is in a separate area and has an alarm in case the door is left open for too long. All surfaces were wiped with disinfectant before and after using the lab. All waste was autoclaved before disposal. All materials were clearly labelled with appropriate warnings.
Hazardous Materials
Special precautions were taken when handling hazardous materials and harmful chemicals. These include concentrated acids and our test gases. All chemical reactions were and are being done in the Fume hood with complete protection including goggles.
Gel Electrophoresis
Our lab has a separate, cordoned-off area for gel electrophoresis. Because the dye Ethidium Bromide is a very hazardous chemical, all gel running and handling was done while wearing gloves, lab coats and eye protection. The gel area has its own stock of materials and equipment such as glassware, pipets, tips etc. that cannot be taken out of the cordoned-off zone.
