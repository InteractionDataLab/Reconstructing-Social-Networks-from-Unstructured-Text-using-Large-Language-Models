Parts Summary
Over the course of this summer, we have created 6 new parts, out of which 2 are basic and 4 are composite. Almost all of our parts have been synthesized using IDT's extremely generous free synthesis offer. We also improved 2 previous parts from the registry — BBa_K248001 and K248002 — by codon optimization and removing restricted sites from their sequence. We then submitted BBa_K2056001 and BBa_K2056002 as improved parts.
