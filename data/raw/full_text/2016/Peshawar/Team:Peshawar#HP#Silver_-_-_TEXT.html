Human Practices Silver
We at team iGEM Peshawar wanted to ensure that the general public had a huge say in our project. So we started with a massive general survey to collect opinions, opinions and more opinions! Following is our fully annotated and simplified analysis of the whole survey. We then used this to alleviate some of the general public's fears reflected in their responses (e.g., by designing a 'Kill-box' device) and by writing and taking a policy paper to our government for the development of synthetic biology in our country!
A total of 220 responders filled our survey. Majority of the responders were from Pakistan.
A large majority of participants seemed to be in favor of introduction and commercialization of Biotech and SynBio products at the state level.
Majority of responders understood that bacteria can be modified and/or directly used to make beneficial products!
A significant number of respondents (64%) were pro-SynBio products and knew quite a bit about terms like DNA, Genetic engineering, RNA and Proteins. They were well informed participants.
A small minority still believes that Genetic engineering is sinful. They only make up 19% of our smaple!
Public Awareness seems to be a divisive topic in general with no clear trends.
76% people would be comfortable with institutionalization of a bacterial strip test. Interestingly, 39% of these do not even own a motorized vehicle! SynBio receptability seems to be generally high!
In case of IP right conflict, 53% opined that the team that worked on a project should hold the most rights to it.
