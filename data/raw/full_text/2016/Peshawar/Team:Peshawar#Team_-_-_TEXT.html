Muhammad Ali
22 | Biochemistry undergrad | University of Karachi
My interests are technology and biosciences and nothing excites me more than a creative fusion of them. My fascination for life forms led me to study life sciences.
I seek challenges which are especially out of my comfort zone and I am not afraid to dive into knowledge unfamiliar to me. I have also represented Pakistan as a youth ambassador in United States of America on a student exchange scholarship.

Abdul Hadi Abro
21 | Genetics undergrad | University of Sindh
I got interested in synthetic biology due to its potential to solve real-world problems. iGEM competition is a chance for me to showcase my ideas, and to work on something meaningful and beneficial that would not only benefit the people of my nation, but possibly the whole world.
My hobbies include doing fitness training, reading fiction and horror, singing, and spending time with my family. I am also an awesome cook by the way.

Muhammad Ismail
21 | Biochemistry undergrad | University of Karachi
Hello world! I am Ismail from Karachi, the city by the sea and I wish to to solve and revolutionize the way we deal with real world problems with the help of synthetic biology.
I enjoy reading about science, history, politics, and people who have changed the world. I love to travel, meet new people, have new experiences and I usually spend my free time either swimming and diving off the coast of Karachi, or having crazy road trips with my friends. I believe that anger and hate are two of humanity's most dangerous enemies, and the world can be a much better place if we all become a little more compassionate, open, and understanding. After all, we are all 99.9% the same — DNA–wise.

Maliha Mashkoor
22 | BS Bioinformatics | Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Women University
I am interested in exploring and analyzing large sets of biological data using different computational and statistical techniques. I always adopt a rigorous approach to attain a deeper understanding of the problem at hand. Problem solving is an exhilarating experience for me — unparalleled by anything else. My attraction in iGEM competition springs from its multi–disciplinary approach which integrates a strong flavor of bioinformatics.
My hobbies include web surfing, blogging, painting, and travelling.

Mansoor Saleem
20 | Biotechnology undergrad | University of Peshawar
I am working on iGEM Project with some of the coolest minds from around the country. We are introducing synthetic biology for the first time in our country; I believe this small effort will prove to be a stepping stone in increasing the pace at which biotechnology is happening currently in this part of the world.

Rayyan Tariq
22 | Biological Sciences undergrad | Forman Christian College Lahore
I love tinkering with technology; whether it is synthetic organisms or Arduinos, I am game for it. Above all, I always look forward to bringing together design and functional inspirations from different mediums and turning them into working prototypes — you know, to aid myself in my grandiose plans of world domination.
When I am not busy playing Ironman, I do MMA and rugby. I am also a professional writer and editor. I love eating dragons and leaving out commas.

Sami Ullah
22 | BS Biotechnology | University of Peshawar
I am from Charsadda — the capital of ancient Ghandhara civilization. Growing up in the countryside, I developed a special appreciation for nature, which found its proper expression when I took up Biotechnology as my major. I wanted to study synthetic biology as it represents fruitful opportunities for future research and economic growth.
I am a social worker and run a welfare organization along with my friends. In my spare time, I read scientific magazines, articles and blogs, and play cricket to maintain my health.

Sarah Farooq
22 | Biotechnology undergrad | University of Peshawar, Pakistan
I hop and hope too much as there is an perpetual voice echoing a big'ol optimistic 'Yes' in my heart. Synthetic biology, to me, is an amalgam of art and science: it has colors, patterns, and beauty that intrigue me.
I am magnetized towards creative and intellectual people. I am not genius — rather a genuine person who gets all the creative ideas, either artistic or scientific, from my own real dreams. I do archery, painting and photography, and like to go on long drives. I fear maths and therefore, love doing it. My thirst for learning new things and skills is never ending.
