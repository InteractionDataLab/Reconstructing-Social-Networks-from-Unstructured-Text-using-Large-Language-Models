To make our mutagenesis system useful for the public, we contacted several experts. Some experts are working in the field of diagnostics and some devote with in vivo mutagenesis.

Searching for a target
Searching for an application field was a difficult task do deal with. Our system is designed for a wide field. But since we need an issue to focus to and optimizing our system to, we asked several experts for their opinion and a review to our mutagenesis system.
Prof Dr. Med. Ulrike Protzer, professor at the technical university in Munich, director of the institute of virology and currently working at the Helmholtz center (German center for environmental health), said, that she could image an application in the virology. We could develop a diagnostic assay, since the production of our Evobodys in E. coli would be cheap. Thus, we could provide a cheap diagnostic for third world countries like Africa.
Something equally said Prof. Dr. Ralf Bartenschlager, professor at the university of Heidelberg and member of the department of infectious diseases, who mentioned emerging viruses. Emerging viruses are viruses that occur suddenly. Most of them are unknown or difficult to find. They can spread in no time. A good example for that are the Zika virus, the MERS-Corona virus, the Ebola virus or newly influenza viruses. As a basic researcher he thinks that our method can perfectly complement modern –omics methods by providing an antibody.
Further topics that are mentioned by other experts can be seen in the following figure:
Figure 1: Overview of expert answers.
To be able to use the mutagenesis system as a detection system we wanted to provide our reporter gen with a fluorescent dye. Thus we are able to detect a cell that produce a suitable Evobody. Also we can measure the strength of the fluorescence und thus conclude to the affinity of our target and Evobody.
Because some experts told us that we must consider the restricted protein folding in E. coli, thereby to look out for disulfide bridges we decided to use monobodies and nanobodies in our library. Proteins with disulfide bonds mostly can not be fold correctly in E. coli and therefore does not work with our bacterial two-hybrid system. Additionally, to begin with we plan to use our mutagenesis system as an antibody refinery like Prof. Dr. Bartenschlager advocates. Thus, we are producing antibody mimetics and provide their sequence to other researchers.
