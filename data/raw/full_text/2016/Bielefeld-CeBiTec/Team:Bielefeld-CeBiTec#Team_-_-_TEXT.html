The Faces of CeBiTec
This is Us!
Our team consists of eleven students from Bielefeld University, was formed in January 2016.
We are supported by our two advisors Julian Droste and Boas Pucker, who are both PhD students in the working groups "Microbial Genomics and Biotechnology" and "Genome Research" respectively. Together with our two PIs Prof. Dr. Joern Kalinowski and Prof. Dr. Kristian Mueller we represent this years team Bielefeld-CeBiTec. On the following pages we will tell you some things about ourselves , our underappreciated hometown Bielefeld and how you can contact us.
