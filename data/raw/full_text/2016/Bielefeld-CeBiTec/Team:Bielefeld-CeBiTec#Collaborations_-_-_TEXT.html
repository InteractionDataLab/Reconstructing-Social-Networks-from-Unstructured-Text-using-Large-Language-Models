Collaborations
A joy that's shared is a joy made double
The milk to our coffee
Working together is especially important in a scientific context - when it comes to iGEM it is indispensable. This year collaborations with three teams came about, the first being Team Düsseldorf, which take part in iGEM for the first time, and the others being Team Freiburg and Team Lethbridge.
Take a look at our collaborations!
Düsseldorf
One partner we frequently collaborated with was the fellow iGEM team Düsseldorf . They are the very first team from the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf so naturally they had a lot of questions on how to get started in iGEM.
We were asked if we could help them on getting started and so we invited them to Bielefeld to answer their questions and aside from that, cake. Topics we discussed were Gibson assembly, Biobrick assembly, Sponsoring and many more. We met again at the German iGEM meet up in Marburg and stayed in touch. This lead to our participation in Düsseldorfs postcard initiative to spread knowledge on synthetic biology where we submitted our own design.
They also invited us to the NRW- day where we had a stall and hold a presentation on our project. What was special about this was that the presentation was open to the public so we had to find a way to simplify our project to an extend that everybody would be able to understand what we were doing. Get a more detailed look here .
Freiburg
At the iGEM Meet Up Germany in Marburg in August where all German iGEM teams participated and presented their projects we gained great insight into their topics. Since we found out that the iGEM team Freiburg 2016 works with Nanobodies, too, we began to exchange experiences. Shortly after our first get together we had a skype call to discuss further details about our projects and possibilities for supporting each other.
Considering the proximity of these aspects of our projects, it was only natural that we shared similar problems. For example, the correct folding of the chosen binding proteins in E. coli. As disulfide bounds are not well built in the cytoplasm and Nanobodies are possessing these when not specifically designed to avoid, we thought about utilizing a bimolecular fluorescence complementation ( BIFC ) as a control for correct protein folding. While further formulating this issue in our calls (click here for our Skype protocol) it crystallized that team Freiburg could make good use of our control system, too. After all we decided to give them the two plasmids necessary for the BIFC in order to have a control.
Lethbridge
We were thrilled after realising that this year’s project from Lethbridge University was similar to our project. They also wanted to screen a library of nanobodies using a bacterial two-hybrid system. After initiating the contact we had several skype meetings ( see here for a complete skype diary ) where we exchanged ideas and talked about each other’s approaches towards the experiments. After a intensive discussion about bacterial two-hybrid systems, we realized that Lethbridge has no positive controls for their two-hybrid system. Therefore we sent them our positive controls: the HA4-Abl SH2 binding pair including the different mutants of HA4 . In this way,we hope to give iGEM Lethbridge the tools to validate their two-hybrid system.
In exchange, Lethbridge provided us with the NS1 peptide from influenza A virus. We wanted to try this peptide as a potential target for our Evobodies. Therefore we could generate Evobodies against the important pathogen influenza A as well.
Networking
While researching together is not only important but fun, the pleasures of networking should not fall too short.
This summer we enjoyed the privilege to be hosts to two other teams, one being team Wageningen which sent a representative on 2016-06-08. By this, we got the chance to have a personal glimpse on their project and to present ours the first time in front of another iGEM team. We had a lot of fun together exchanging ideas and talking about the iGEM competition!
The other team was team Aachen on the 2016-09-23. We invited them for a BBQ after we got to know each other on the iGEM Meet Up Germany on which we sparked each other’s interests in our projects. While having a great time talking about the innovations we had taken in our projects we got the time for chatting about milder hindrances, mostly in practical work. After some troubleshooting we had, it was made clear that networking is an important part of the iGEM competition.
We appreciate the great days we spent together. ❤
Road trip to Marburg
From August 5th to August 7th we took part at the iGEM Meetup Germany in Marburg. It was a great opportunity for getting to know all the German teams and further the iGEM Team SDU Denmark and their projects and even though Traci from the HQ! We had a fantastic weekend exchanging experiences and having a nice time.
Thank you Marburg for the cordial board and lodgings!
