Culture drives great results. - Jack Welch
Introduction
One of the fundamental aspects when establishing a directed evolution approach is to grant an advantage to the individuals with favorable         properties. In our setup we coupled correct binding properties of our Evobody proteins to a growth advantage in the form of a gradual         ampicillin resistance. To determine the applicability of this resistance and how selective pressure can be applied, we did several fermentations         to characterize the used strain.
Shaker flask cultivation with varying antibiotic concentrations
When communicating with industry associated experts, one question we were constantly asked was:"Why do you use ampicillin? Is ampicillin an adequate         selection marker?" We thought about the possibility to use other antibiotics as our resistance marker, but as a huge part of our selective system was based on the beta-lactamase, we were hesitating to change our system.   So, to determine whether or not ampicillin was suitable for our projects goals, we designed a series of experiments of cultivations using          different setups regarding          resistancy and a broad range of different ampicillin concentrations. The strain which we used was meant to immitate our final construct.          That is why we transformed E. coli JS200 with pHSG-EPPolI and pSB1AK3. We cultivated 25 ml LB in 250 ml shaker flasks at 37째C and 150 RPM.         Inoculation was done to gain an initial optical density of 0.1. The ampicillin concentration was varied between 0 g/l and 10 g/l.         Additionally kanamycin and chloramphenicol were added at adequate concentrations to grant plasmid stability. All Experiments were also         done with a JS200 strain containing the pHSG-WTPolI plasmid to determine possible differences when cultivated under ampicillin.
Figure 1: Growth curve of JS200 containing pWTPolI and pSB1AK3.Growth curve of JS200 strains containing pHSG-pWTPolI and pSB1AK3   The cells were cultivated between 10-16 h in LB Medium. The medium was supplemented with adequate concentrations of kanamycin, chloramphenicol and 0, 0.1, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0 and 10.0 g/l ampicillin.
Figure 2: Growth curve of JS200 containing pEPPolI and pSB1AK3.Growth curve of JS200 strains containing an error prone DNA polymerase I pHSG  and pSB1AK3   The cells were cultivated between 12-18 h in LB Medium. The medium was supplemented with adequate concentrations of kanamycin, chloramphenicol and 0, 0.1, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0 and 10.0 g/l ampicillin.
As you can see in Figures 1 and 2 higher ampicillin concentrations have a major impact on the growth properties of the strain containing the         error prone DNA polymerase I. However the strain containing the plasmid carrying the wildtype DNA polymerase I is almost not influenced by         a raised ampicillin concentration. The differences in ampicillin sensibility may be caused by the low fidelity property of the error prone          polymerase I . The different activities directly influence the ColE1-like plasmid pSB1AK3 and connected to this, the beta-lactamase presence in culture.         Based on this results, we decided that ampicillin is indeed an adequat selective marker for our system, as long as we keep the quantitative aspect of the beta-lactamase expression as low as possible.    To achieve this, we integrated our reporter construct into the genome of the E. coli strain we were using.    As it can be seen in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the lower the plasmid copy number, the more influence has ampicillin.      It can be seen in Figure 2 that a higher ampicillin concentration is directly associated to the elongation of the lag phase of the respective culture.    As our selection construct is meant to express beta-lactamase corellating with the binding properties of our Evobodies,                  we switched to different fermentation methods to change ampicillin concentration over time.
Continous cultivation with a secondary feed in a turbidostat
Repeated batch fermentation with different ampicillin concentrations per cycle
However, as our selection system directly correlates to the expression of the beta-lactamase, we can assume that a selective advantage through higher beta-lactamase expression would have the same impact as a lower ampicillin concentration.   But what does this mean in context of the ability of ampicillin to work as a selection marker?
Usage of a low budget turbidostat to increase selective pressure
To further characterize the mutation system used in our evolutionary process, we used a low budget turbidostat provided by the departement of molecular              biotechnology of the University of Potsdam. After doing reversion tests in shaker flasks we took the leap to the turbidostat and applied selective pressure             in form of antibiotics. By doing a continuous fermentation while constantly increasing the ampicillin concentration in the Medium             feed, we were able to optimize the revertant frequency in culture. Inoculation was done with E. coli JS200 pEPPolI and freshly transformed earlyStop beta-lactamase .
The complete setup can be seen in figure 3. After autoclaving for sterilization the antibiotics were added under sterile conditions. To             increase the selective pressure a  second feed bottle was connected to the primary feed and 2 g/l Amp LB has been pumped with a rate of about             18 ml/h. The primary feed was adjusted to keep the OD in the bioreactor at 0.5. To sustain a minimum of thermal degradation the 2 g/l Amp LB was stored             on ice for the duration of cultivation. A clean inoculation was done through a septum in the fermenter lid. To provide constant conditions the whole fermenter              was placed in a 37째C incubator and 10x Amp LB was pumped through an opening in the incubator seal.

As you can see in figure 4             the culture reached the target OD within 7 h and dropped rapidly when the medium feed diluted the cell suspension. However, the population regenerated quickly and reached the target              OD of 0.5 after about 18 h. After fermentation the population was screened for revertants to calculate reversion frequency. The results of these experiments can be read here .
