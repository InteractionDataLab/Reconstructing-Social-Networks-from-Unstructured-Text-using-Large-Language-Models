BBa_K2082106: Error-prone Polymerase I
For higher the variety of our Evobody library, mutation is a necessary step. One big problem in case of mutation systems is the arbitrarily mutation rate of the mutation proteins on the whole DNA. It is not able to control where mutation can happen. This error-prone polymerase I, a mutated E. coli DNA-Polymerase I, shows very rare mutations in the genomic DNA and spared the mutation of important proteins for the cell. With this part we want to create a possibilty for increased usage of an in vivo mutagenesis system implemented in the iGEM parts registry and usable by all coming iGEM teams. For further informations visit our Best Basic Part site.
Best Composite Part
BBa_K2082231:
Together with the part BBa_K2082221 the part BBa_K2082231 is one very important factor of our created bacterial two-hybrid system. It contains not only one fusion protein for the system, it also contains the whole modified reporter construct with the binding site for the cI protein of phage 434. With this part we want to make it possible for every coming iGEM member to create their own bacterial two-hybrid system for in vivo selection directly in E. coli. To get better informations about what we have achieved with this part you can go on our Best Composite Part site.

BBa_K2082000, BBa_K2082004, BBa_K2082005: Monobody construction kit
For the iGEM community we designed not 10 or 100 coherently parts. Our part collection includes 100,000 distinct sequences of special binding proteins, namely monobodies. We, the team iGEM Bielefeld 2016, want to enrich the iGEM community with a whole library of monobodies freely usable for everyone. With this collection we do not only integrate a new category in the iGEM part registry database, we implemented a whole fundamental framework composed on the monobody constant regions and RFP instead of the variable regions, which can easily exchanged for creating a specific monobody or even an own library. To round off the library we do not only create a framework for monobodies, we also created a similar framework for nanobodies, too ( BBa_K208001 , BBa_K208006 ). For more informations about our part collection visit our Best Part Collection site.
Improve a part
DnaQ is part of the DNA polymerase III and responsible for the proofreading activity of this complex. The dnaQ926 variant     loses this activity through mutation of two function essential amino acids inside the active site. The complete loss of proofreading as well as the resulting saturation of mismatch-repair makes dnaQ926 the single strongest mutator gene known (Fijalkowska und Schaaper 1996)
dnaQ926 is part of our genome wide mutator BBa_K2082117, but we also used it as a standalone mutator in BBa_K2082116. After initially     designing our genome wide mutator we looked for mutagensis gene already in the iGEM partsreg and found several candidates.     The most prominent one is iGEM SYSU-China 2014's dnaQ926 BBa_K1333108 .    Furthermore, we use iGEM Uchicago IGSB2014's emrR and dam in our large genome wide mutator.
For the full characterization you can visit the Improve a part page or the registry entry of the origin part.
