Thankful for absolutely everything
General Support
Prof. Dr. Jörn Kalinowski provided us with our own laboratory and the resources of his work group. Thus, he gave us the opportunity to participate in iGEM. Also he was always there to help us with questions and occurring problems. Thanks for believing in your iGEM teams year after year!
As our secondary PI Prof. Dr. Kristian M. Müller supported us with materials and equipment and participated in our weekly team meetings to give us scientific guidance.
Julian Droste, Boas Pucker: Thank you for always taking time when we needed a good advice. We hope that we were not too annoying, even if our questions were usually simple. Without you we would still searching for our laboratory stuff.
Nils-Christian Lübke, Manuel Wittchen, Timo Wolf, Matthias Ruwe, Uyen Linh Ho and Janina Lüders helped us with their knowledge about iGEM. As former iGEM members they gladly supported us. Thank you guys!
Modeling Support
Dr. Petra Lutter was so kind to introduce us into the world of modeling. She gave us a lot of advices during weekly meetings. Huge thanks for your help and cheering words.
Analytics Support
Klaudia Grunwald assisted us in preparing and measuring samples for the protein identification via MALDI-TOF.
Marco Radukic gave us an introduction in device Blitz.
Anika Winkler prepared and sequenced libraries on the MiSeq for us. Many thanks for this spontaneous support!
Sequencing Core Fascility : Also great thanks to our in-house Sequencing Core Facility.
Georg Falck gave us advice in phagemid display and administrated our Geneious server.
Material Support
Prof. Dr. Manel Camps : A huge thanks goes to Manel Camps, who provided us with material for the two-plasmid system and helped us with his advices.
The Chair of Genome Research helped us with lab materials and bioinformatic software support.
The work group Microbial Genomics and Biotechnology allowed us to use their laboratories and equipment. Moreover, they showed great patience when we occupied the equipment.
Stefan A. Hoffmann, Christian Wohltat and Kristian M. Müller provided us our own turbidostat. Thanks for that!
Prof. Dr. Karl Friehs and Prof. Dr. Thomas Noll gave us tips and information about process engineering.
Prof. Dr. Thomas Dierks & Biochemistry 1 work group provided purified FGE for phagemid display.
Dr. Joe Max Risse gave us information about fermentation.
Bioinformatics Resource Facility : Thanks for your great technical support.
Prof. Dr. Volker Wendisch and the Wendisch Lab helped us with materials and introductions into different machines.
The work group Fermentation Technology allowed us to use their expertise.
Finaly, we want to thank Prof. Dr. Walter Arnold , Dr. Werner Selbitschka and Kerstin Röllke for the mediation of contacts to interested high school classes.
