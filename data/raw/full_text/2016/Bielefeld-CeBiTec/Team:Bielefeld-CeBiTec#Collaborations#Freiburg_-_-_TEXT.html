A joy that's shared is a joy made double
Freiburg
Protocol from 2016-08-30
Participants Freiburg: Tina , Vivi , Chris , Kevin , Wlad
Paricipants Bielefeld: Cassandra , Judith , Fabian , Pascal , Mika
A first introduction to their projects was given from each team.
This year team Freiburg is working on a way for targeted drug delivery through bacterial spores. You can learn more about Team Freiburgs project here .
Freiburg:
Exchanging Nanobodies with different binding properties
mCherry-/GFP binders were offered
Showed interest in our selection system
Offered measuring the binding affinity with the OCTET RED, a device to measure affinity of proteins
Minimal specifications for measurements were discussed (cloning into an expression vector and adding his-tags, as well as the purification of protein, etc.)
Bielefeld:
Exchanging Nanobodies with different binding properties
A part of our library was offered
We then talked about having more controls for the correction protein folding of their Nanobodies
Our Nabobody BIFC-Control was mentioned to them and suggested as well-suited for this part
We then agreed to exchange abstracts and discussed ways we could aid each other.
Summary:
Freiburg: Think about having a control similar to our Nanobody BIFC-System.
Bielefeld: Think about getting the affinity of our binding proteins to specific targets measured by Team Freiburg.
Protocol from 2016-09-15
Participants Freiburg: Wlad
Paricipants Bielefeld: Judith , Mika
The projects were once again resumed and innovations were stated. We then came back to the topics we could help each other out.
Freiburg:
The principle of the OCTET RED measurement and the conditions the proteins have to fulfill were mentioned once again.
It was stated that the antigen gets coupled with a biosensor for the measurement
He suggested that we should think of an additional exporter for secretion in the periplasm
Once again we talked about the protein purification and the necessity of a his-tag
The amount of time necessary for the correct condition was estimated.
Bielefeld:
Our Nanobody BIFC-Control was once again mentioned and the advantages were stated
We suggested sending them the two plasmids necessary for the BIFC containing the sequences for it.
We then informed them about the way they would be used and talked about how the split-proteins were designed and agreed on sending them the '.genious-file' and further details .
The conversation then switched back to the OCTET RED measurement Team Freiburg offered to carry out for us
We stated that the way of protein purification we chose ( IMPACT ) made tags unnecessary
We proceeded by telling them we would be able to use another way for defining the affinity between our target protein and our binder
Summary:
We agreed to send them our Nanobody BIFC-control
