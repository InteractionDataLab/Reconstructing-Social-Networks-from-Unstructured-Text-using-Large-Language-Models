The journey is the goal
Overview
A great benefit for iGEM competitions is the possibility to form smaller groups within a team which have their own responsible tasks. Still, for the outcome of a successful teamwork it is crucial to share all methods which were used to perform the experiments and to share all results for further discussions and experiments. For this purpose, an entire documentation of our work is an essential part of the project.
This section contains all data concerning our total experimental progress. These include weekly protocols from the work in the lab (see "Lab Notebook” ), all oligonucleotide sequences for the design of the primers (see "Primers” ), and lab protocols from previous iGEM teams which were used especially in the beginning of our work (see "Lab Protocols” ). Additionally, all buffers and media which were prepared are listed under the section “Media and Buffers” .
