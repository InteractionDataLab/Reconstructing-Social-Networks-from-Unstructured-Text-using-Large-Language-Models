We have achieved following experiment results as the DEMONSTRATION of our project.
We have constructed a signal pathway in bacteria for sensing the indicating-molecule Nitric Oxide of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and secreting Epidermal Growth Factors which contribute to the recovery of IBD. The pathway, which is illustrated in Figure A, consists of two sections: Nitric oxide sensing and Epidermal Growth Factor expression.

We have constructed a biofilm-display system. Beneficial molecules are linked to biofilm monomers to assembly outside the cell, forming extracellular matrix (Figure B). This would show the potential value of this display approach.

We have constructed a kill switch which inhibits the growth of bacteria under our control (Figure C). This switch ensures the safety for both our lab work and the therapy.
