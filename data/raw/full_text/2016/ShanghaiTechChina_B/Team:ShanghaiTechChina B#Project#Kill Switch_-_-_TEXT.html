kill switch
In the applications of synthetic biology, people always hold the question of safety of genetic engineered organism. There exists the potential risk of gene horizontal transfer and other issues for organism which worked outside our lab. So, we need to take some measure to guarantee the safety of our bacterial material. Even for technicians who work within lab, it would be convenient for them to terminate organism’s life when they want.
In our project which has designed bacteria to work in gut, a kill switch to control the life of genetic engineered bacteria should be taken into consideration.
Here are many reasons for the necessity to design corresponding kill switch in our project. Firstly, in the complex environment such as gut, where exists many different species, horizontal gene transfer is much more likely to happen. It would be a disaster if we do not take related measures. Secondly, one therapy should be terminated as we hope. Our special therapy use biological material, so it is necessary to design a kind of killer switch, putting the whole therapy under control.
So we decide to use two kind of killer gene, killer red and phi 174 gene E, to terminate genetic engineered bacteria’s life under different condition.
Killer red
Killer red is a kind of protein that could produce ROS (Reactive oxygen species) from water, which could terminate their lifespan, under the illumination of 585 nm light. This protein would not work without the illumination of specific light, so, when in gut, they will not affect our bacteria without our induction. When out bacteria outside, it would die soon exposed to sunshine.
Killer red has a kind of barrel protein domain and owns QYG chromophore which could emit red fluorescent under the illumination of green light (585 nm), producing ROS from water to kill cell.
We have successfully induce the expression of this protein and test it’s efficiency under 585 nm illumination. This picture below showed the expression of killer red under the illumination of laser. The body of E.coli stood out in this picture.
After the illumination of fluorescent microscope for 4 hours, we cultivate them in 37℃ drying oven overnight, and we could see it clearly that the culture medium which both under induction and illumination is smooth, have no bacteria survive, and the others(one illuminated by light and not induced, one induced without illumination of light, one neither induced nor illuminated) surface are rough, indicating the growth of E.coli.
Phi 174 Gene E
Gene E is a kind of lysis protein from phage. It could help promote efficient cell lysis by inhibit cell wall synthesis.
We can induce the expression of gene E under different condition such as heat shock or small molecule. If we want to terminate the therapy, we could give our patient heat shock or other small chemistry molecular, thus induce the end of bacteria’s life. We have tested the efficiency of gene under the temperature control operon. We insert Gene E into the multiple clone site of pBV220, which would express our protein under the condition of 42℃
However, we found it surprising that it would be much more efficient in 37℃ than in 42℃, And it actually showed the efficiency of gene E
Then we induced the expression of gene E under small chemistry molecular, IPTG. These data showed below ,under the induction of the corresponding small chemistry molecular, the gene E can terminate bacteria’s life as we hope. On the other hand, even when we use the BL21(DEe)plyss, which could express toxin protein, the results showed serious leaking expression. This gene is too toxin to cultivate them to OD 0.2.
