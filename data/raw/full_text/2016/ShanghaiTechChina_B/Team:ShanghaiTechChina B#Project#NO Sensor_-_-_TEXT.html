NO gradient in IBD patients, and the SNP releasing NO
Introduction
As the first discovered cellular signaling molecule, Nitric Oxide (NO) plays a vital role in in many physiological and pathological processes. There’s a significant increase of NO concentration within the gut of IBD patients. [1-3] We utilized NO molecule as a “marker” for inflammatory position, and engineered E.coli to detect NO, so as to sense the inflammation.
NO gradient in IBD patients
Previous research showed that there’s a NO gradient within the gut of IBD patients. [1-3] The half-life of NO under physiological condition is only few seconds, so the NO gradient has a short distance but a sharp NO concentration peak at the inflammatory position. These features makes NO molecule a novel inflammation “marker”.

SNP releasing NO
There are several reagents that can release NO in aqueous solution. One of them is called Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a member of the NO-releasing drugs, which is originally used as a peripheral vasodilator.
In order to understand the kinetics of SNP releasing NO in LB, or say the environment where E.coli is cultured, we detected the concentration of NO in SNP-LB solution by Griess reagent.[4] And plotted the Dynamic curves of different concentrations of SNP releasing NO.
Figure 1. The Dynamic curves of different concentrations of SNP releasing NO. The SNP concentrations are 10 μM, 100 μM, 1 mM, 10 mM and 0 μM (control) in each group. Data are means(SD) (n=3 samples per group).
The result shows the kinetics of SNP releasing NO in LB. From the dynamic curves, we could see that even low concentration of SNP could continuously release NO for 5~6 hours or even more, and the concentration of released NO is just appropriate for mimic the rectal NO concentration of patients of IBD, which is about 10 μM [3].
Figure 2. The concentration of NO released by SNP in LB medium were determined by Griess reagent. Add Griess reagents to samples within 96-well plate and read the absorbance at 540 nm by the microplate photometer.
These conclusions suggest that SNP releasing NO in LB culture could mimic the NO gradient in the inflammatory gut of IBD patients. (换个更好的用词)
NO Sensing
Microbiome have evolved several biological NO sensors, including SoxR protein, FNR family, NorR protein and so on. [4] NorR protein has an N-terminal regulatory domain, which is regulated by NO molecule, and a C-terminal DNA binding domain, which will binds to promoter pNorV to initiate transcription when activated.

We integrated this system to a vector into E.coli, which would produce NorR protein constitutively and activate pNorV transcription if NO exists.
