Safety
Over the past few months, we attempted to utilize our engineered bacteria to help treating IBD. We attached great significance to safety issues--not only to our lab work, but also to the project design and products.
Lab work safety
To meet our school requirement, all students have received systematic safety training from a supervisor before doing any lab work. In addition, we have read a series of courses called “The Experiment Safety” to ensure our own safety. We wore proper protective equipment (gloves, lab coats, and eyewear if necessary) at all times in the lab. As shown in Fig.1, we wore proper lab coat and gloves when performing the Nitric Oxide releasing experiment inside a biosafety hood.

Project safety
Our team mainly worked with E.coli, which belongs to Level 1 risk group. We therefore stuck to biosafety level 1 requirement. Most notably, we have blueprinted that our engineered bacteria can applied for potential therapeutic use in human patients. We attached great significance to the safety issue of the bacteria we have modified, which might be a threat to host patients as well as the environment if without proper control. We thereby designed two kill switchesto limit their spreading at the end of our therapeutic schedule.
Our first 'kill switch' is the killer red, a toxic fluorescent protein that kills bacteria with reactive oxygen species after light illumination. We have validated its function in stopping bacteria growth. Next, we also applied a cell lysis protein gene E to kill bacteria, and found its induced expression would certainly curtain bacteria growth. Thus, our proof-of-principle experiment demonstrated the kill switches we engineered inside of bacteria can be effective to stop bacteria spreading.
In addition, we sought a physical approach by designing a 'warship' to lock bacteria inside of a confined device, but still allowed exchanging chemicals with the outsides (so that bacteria can still receive nutrient and secret useful molecules). As expected, we proved that this small warship served its function in limiting bacteria spreading
