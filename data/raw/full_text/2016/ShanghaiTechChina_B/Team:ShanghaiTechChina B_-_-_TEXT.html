Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are an inflammatory condition affecting the bowel linings. It has a high incidence, especially in developed counties. Signs and symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss. Unfortunately, there is no known cure currently. Therefore, our team is seeking for therapies towards these refractory diseases.
To teat IBDs, we turned to gut microbes for help. We armed E.coli with various weapons (renamed as Gutrio) so that they can automatically search and destroy targets (which are IBDs). The name Gutrio is a combination of Gut and the famous adventurer Mario in video game Super Mario.
Gutrios eliminate their enemies with the EGF bullets.
Gutrios lock their enemies by tracing Nitric Oxide.
Gutrios call for reinforcements with the Quorum Sensing system.
Gutrios terminate their missions while a Kill Switch turns on.
Gutrios travel inside a Warship for safety.
