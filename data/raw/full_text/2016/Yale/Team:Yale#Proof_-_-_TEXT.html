Designing Ribosome Binding Sites compatible with Anderson Promoters for use with flourescent reporters
After previously having trouble with efficient expression off of Anderson promoters, we used the Salis Lab Ribosome Binding Site calculator to design a strong ribosome binding site that enables robust expression from Anderson Promoters. We have submitted a Biobrick device consisting of several Anderson promoters fused to an RBS and Citrine reporter gene. (see Parts ). This device is characterized here .
Cloning Promoters from Sinorhizobia meliloti with Citrine Reporters
These devices were cloned and submitted to the Registry ). This device is characterized in E. coli here and behaves as expected in E coli.
