Nodulation Assay
To ensure that rhizobia do not lose the nod plasmid, necessary for nodule formation on legume roots, after being subjected to the heat-shock prior to performing MAGE, we conducted a nodulation assay. This assay involves inoculating cowpea roots with both untransformed (control) and pORTMAGE-3 transformed (experimental) R. tropici and S. meliloti and observing the presence or absence of nodule formation. Below are some images of our nodulation apparatus.
