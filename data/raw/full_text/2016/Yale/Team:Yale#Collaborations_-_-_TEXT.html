Biocontainment with the University of Virginia
How often do iGEM teams take into account biocontainment when designing their projects? What form do these biocontainment strategies take? The University of Virgina iGEM team wants to find out, and we filled out their survey and chatted with their team members to help them. We are particularly interested in these questions as well, since biocontainment is a major issue surrounding the exploration and colonization of Mars. NASA's Planetary Protection Office notes that biological contamination "may obscure our ability to find life elsewhere – if it exists"!
