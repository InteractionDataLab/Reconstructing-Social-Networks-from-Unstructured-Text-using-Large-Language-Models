                    heating for incubation. This ensures that the enclosure will not undergo degradation or overheating.
                </P><P>The goal was to maintain an agar plate at 37C while retaining access to the top. The enclosure was
                    not well insulated, but adding insulation would interfere with existing functionality. Therefore,
                    heat was applied immediately underneath the plate.</P><P>Nichrome wire was used as the heating element, and the wire was insulated from the existing aluminum
                    plate with Kapton. A thermistor provides the feedback path and was bonded to the aluminum plate.</P><SPAN class="image 8u -2u  12u(mobile)">Once fully integrated, the incubator tray is nearly invisible</SPAN></ARTICLE><ARTICLE class="row align-justify"><HEADER class="special"><H4>Calculations</H4></HEADER><P>The enclosure's leakiest heat path is through a 3mm thick acrylic wall with almost one square meter
                    of surface area. This provides very little material insulation, so the loss path is dominated by
                    convective cooling.</P><UL class="default"><LI>Conductivity Estimate: 65 Watts per Kelvin</LI><LI>Convection Estimate: 20 Watts per Kelvin</LI></UL><P>To maintain the entire enclosure at 37C, the heater needs to push 250 Watts. This is 13 Amps out of
                    the 18V supply and does not include any headroom for getting up to 37C- just maintaining an existing
                    temperature.</P><P>Reducing the scope to only maintaining the plate allows us to use the trapped air as insulation. A
                    second convection barrier with a much smaller surface area is estimated to be 0.025 square meters.
                    This becomes about 0.3 Watts per Kelvin. Much more reasonable!</P><P>The new power requirement is therefore ~50 Watts, allowing for some headroom and is just under 3 Amps
                    from the 18V supply and a 6.5 Ohm heater element. For 5 Ohms, 15 inches of Nichrome were cut, and
                    resistance was verified by measuring a programmable power supply across it. Nichrome has a positive
                    temperature coefficient, so it draws less power when it is hot, so a length adjustment was needed to
                    return it back to 50W output at temperature.</P></ARTICLE><ARTICLE class="row align-justify"><HEADER class="special"><H4>Heater Element Construction</H4></HEADER><P>The next step was to attach the Nichrome element to the aluminum plate. High-temperature Kapton tape
                    was ordered but hadn't arrived yet. Knowing full-well this was a terrible idea, electrical tape was
                    tried. It burned immediately.</P><P>Rebuilt with high temperature Kapton tape, the heater element was tested at 4x the intended power for
                    5 minutes and held up surprisingly well. There were no shorts, but the areas that were holding the
                    Nichrome in tension had some damage.</P><P>The third iteration added small ceramic beads to the Nichrome element. The beads electrically and
                    thermally isolated the Nichrome while dispersing the pressure on the Kapton tape. It is a much lower
                    fire hazard as it now takes longer for the effects to become noticeable.</P></ARTICLE><ARTICLE class="row align-justify"><HEADER class="special"><H4>Regulator</H4></HEADER><P>This is a simple bang-bang temperature regulator using an ATTiny, a thermistor, and a FET. If the
                    measured temperature is below 35C, it turns the heater element on. Once it is above 27C, it turns
                    the heater element off. Any temperature outside of 20C - 40C means that something has broken, so it
                    turns everything off until it is power-cycled.</P><P>R3/J3 are the thermistor, forming a divider with R4. T1 is the control FET, controlling R2/J2. IC1 is
                    the ATTiny. IC2 is a voltage regulator to knock the input power down to 3.3V for the ATTiny.</P></ARTICLE><ARTICLE class="row align-justify"><HEADER class="special"><H4>Final Assembly</H4></HEADER><SPAN class="image 8u -2u  12u(mobile)">Power wire from board is snaked up through an existing hole.</SPAN><SPAN class="image 8u -2u  12u(mobile)">Additional reinforcement.</SPAN><SPAN class="image 8u -2u  12u(mobile)">Heating element connected and attached</SPAN></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV><DIV id="copyright" class="container"><UL class="menu"><LI>© EMW Streetbio and iGEM 2016</LI><LI>Design: Thras Karydis &amp;<A href="http://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
