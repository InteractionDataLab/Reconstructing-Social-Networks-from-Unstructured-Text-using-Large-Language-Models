Biota Beats and the Street Bio Youth Science Initiative
As a part of bringing Biota Beats to our community, we chose to engage with local middle school-aged                     youth through a pioneering community youth science initiative. As integrated STEAM (science,                     technology, engineering, art, and math) curriculums gain traction and prosper in today’s schools,                     Biota Beats provided Street Bio with a unique opportunity for community youth engagement. At the                     crossroads of music and science, Biota Beats gives young aspiring scientists the chance to blend                     together scientific curiosity, biotechnology and musical creativity. In order to bring Biota Beats                     to local youth, we pioneered the EMW Bookstore Street Bio Youth Science Initiative with the goal of                     immersing local, underrepresented youth at the forefront of science.

Street Bio in the Community
Of all the world’s cities, Cambridge undoubtedly stands out as a bright hub of science, education,                     and creativity. Local biotechnology startups, interdisciplinary research centers, and world-renowned                     universities contribute to a lively neighborhood that prides itself on innovation and curiosity.                     Often times, however, as a community member the opportunity to engage with such exciting activity                     can feel limited to those who possess university affiliations and professional credentials. In turn,                     the institutions that aim to contribute to the advancement of science for society can seem exclusive                     - sequestered to the “ivory tower.” In an effort to counter this institutional exclusivity EMW                     Bookstore created the community program, Street Bio. Street Bio’s mission is to explore the                     interface of engineered biology and “the street” - the people, culture, and products that will shape                     how biology leaves the lab and enters our everyday lives. Believing that biology is humanity’s next                     technological revolution, we ask, who will be empowered to participate? By bringing Biota Beats to                     our community, and in particular the youth in our community, we hope to empower young aspiring                     scientists by fostering their creativity and scientific curiosity ultimately encouraging them to let their imaginations run wild - a known prerequisite for groundbreaking science.
Among Street Bio’s many projects, which include building out an in-house community laboratory and                     managing the international course “How to Grow (Almost) Anything,” we first engaged with youth                     through a collaboration with the Cambridge Science Festival (the first-of-its-kind celebration                     highlighting fun and leading edge STEAM projects in our region). Importantly, as educational                     curriculums move from STEM to STEAM, educators and students alike are realizing the false dichotomy                     between science and art and how the two disciplines synergize immensely well in many respects. In                     April 2016, EMW collaborated with Amino Labs on a 2-day workshop for                     youth as a part of the                     Cambridge Science Festival. Over the course of a weekend, more than 20 youth, from late elementary                     school to middle school, participated in a hands-on workshop where they learned about synthetic                     biology and applied their knowledge to culture bacteria in the Amino One, a table-top bacterial                     culture system. The students cultured E. coli and transformed bacteria with recombinant DNA.

Pioneering the Youth Science Initiative
Following our successful collaboration with the Cambridge Science Festival, Street Bio aspired to                     make a commitment to local youth engagement through STEAM in an effort to foster a fun learning                     environment conducive to boundless scientific curiosity and unlimited imaginative exploration. As                     luck would have it, Crystal Johnson, a parent of one of the participants at our Street Bio/Cambridge                     Science Festival program connected with Street Bio founder, David Kong. Johnson, founder of                     Integrative Sustainability and Environmental Solutions and accomplished energy strategist, shared                     our excitement regarding continued youth engagement in the sciences. After several teleconferences,                     we planned a recurring weekend youth program focused on engaging local youth at the forefront of                     science, and thus, EMW Bookstore’s Street Bio Youth Science Initiative (YSI) was born.
In an effort to advance Street Bio’s mission, the YSI has been geared towards engaging                     underrepresented and disadvantaged local youth in science - girls, youth of color, low socioeconomic                     status. Upon forming partnerships with local biotechnology startup Ginkgo Bioworks, research groups                     at MIT Media Lab, and an astronaut at NASA, we ultimately developed a theme centered on                     sustainability and a timeline for recurring weekend workshops where each YSI session would take                     place at a different laboratory and we would spend the day learning, asking questions, building,                     experimenting, and bonding over our shared love for science.

After several weeks of publicizing the YSI, the first session took place on October 15th, 2016. That                     morning, our pioneering cohort of youth participants arrived at Ginkgo Bioworks - a bioengineering                     startup nestled on the drydock in Boston’s Seaport District. After a brief introduction to YSI and                     its core organizers, the majority of the day centered on the idea of “Making Molecules.” Initial                     interactive lessons described several microorganisms in nature, how some make their own molecules                     and for what purposes. Presenters drew on examples such as haloarchaea and yeast.

Didactic lectures were kept to the bare minimum while activities, videos, pair sharing, and                     demonstrations were the main educational tools used. YSI participants were always encouraged to                     participate and ask questions.

A design activity, where participants were given the opportunity to design their own microbes,                     yielded incredibly innovative ideas ranging from microbial pollution eliminators, water purity                     indicators, mini-machine repairers, and even microbes that would enable ovenless baking!

Following a pizza lunch, the cohort was given a personalized tour of the Ginkgo Bioworks foundry.                     There, the youth were given an overview of how the lab uses robots and tools like bioreactors,                     fermentation hoods, and mass spectrometers to build microbes that make molecules.

Eventually, following the foundry tour the cohort had a second set of interactive lessons on the                     human microbiome and the intersections between the microbiology and engineering. Through a guided                     question-and-answer lesson, the YSI participants demonstrated a strong understanding of microbiota.                     We then transitioned over from our science studies to music. We brought in and set up a classic                     vinyl record player and while playing a Stevie Wonder record, we explained how we might be able to                     create records out of our own microbiota.
We used a classic record player in parallel with our hacked Biota Beats microbiome record player to show how we would play our own microbiome records.
The youth were shown how microbiomes cultured on an agar plate resembled classic vinyl records and                     were given a demonstration as to how a new type of record player could play music from our cultured                     microbiota. Soon after the demonstration, we instructed each participant to swab different parts of                     their body and inoculate their personal agar plate-records with their microbiota. They quickly and                     excitedly began swabbing, inoculating, and essentially composing their own microbiome records.

Upon completely inoculating their personalized microbiome records, the YSI participants were asked to                     take their records home. They were given specific instructions to take pictures of their records as                     the microbiota grew each day. As they continue to share their images with our Street Bio team, we                     are sonifying their records, giving our youth participants the opportunity to produce their own                     electronic music using their individual microbiome records.
Biota Beats and Beyond
By bringing Biota Beats to our community through the Youth Science Initiative, we are providing local                     youth with the unique opportunity to participate in a novel STEAM education program. Our initial YSI                     cohort demonstrated strong enthusiasm in Biota Beats because of how the project brought together                     music, microbiology, and biotechnology. The youth were able to be creative and innovate while                     excitedly engaging with their passions for science. As Street Bio continues to make a strong                     commitment to community youth engagement we hope to use continue using Biota Beats as an exemplary                     model for STEAM education.
