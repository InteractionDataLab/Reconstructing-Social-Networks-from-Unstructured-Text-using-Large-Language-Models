Once inoculated, our microbiome records were imaged utilizing an
                    open-source camera to generate 2D images. We developed several approaches to generate sound and
                    music from these images, with a principal question in mind: how is the sound meaningful from a
                    biological perspective?</P><P>Ultimately, we focused on three forms of data that could be extracted from the images of our
                    records: microbe location, density, and cluster size. Given the design of our records, we could add
                    an additional layer of information by having different segments of each record correspond to
                    organisms swabbed from different parts of the body. With our incubator and camera, we could also
                    take time-lapse images, adding a time parameter. Based on these inputs, we developed several
                    algorithms to convert these data streams to sound and music. </P></ARTICLE><ARTICLE class="row"><HEADER class="special"><H4>Background</H4></HEADER><P><U>Sonification:</U> the use of non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data.</P><P>Auditory perception has advantages in temporal, spatial, amplitude, and frequency resolution that
                    open
                    possibilities as an alternative complement to visualisation techniques.</P><P>There is prior work sonifying algae data, star data, and microbial data into music by various
                    methods.
                    For example, scientists looked for patterns in readings from blue-green algae samples collected in
                    the
                    western English Channel then transformed the data into musical notes:

                    The tune &quot;Bloom&quot; illustrates how some
                    algae species bloom occasionally and become more abundant for short periods of time. They had lower
                    abundance of microbe correspond to lower notes, and chord progression was related to day length,
                    chlorophyll concentration in the water, and other physical parameters.</P><P>Here astronomers converted star data from NASA's Kepler telescope into reggae songs:

                    using prior image processing techniques. First, a Gaussian filter reduces the image noise, and the
                    image
                    is converted to a black-and-white binary image. The location of the center of each cluster and the
                    size
                    of each cluster are stored. Based on this information, the density of each area on the plate is
                    computed.</P><P>Each image is mapped to a coordinate system, and the colony location correlates to musical notes, or
                    pitches. Then density of the colonies corresponds to background music. Granular Synthesis is a
                    method by
                    which sounds are broken into tiny grains that are redistributed and reorganized to form other
                    sounds.
                    Here the concept of granular synthesis is used with the density data.</P><P>In the first attempt, shape and size of the colonies was to correlate to different scale types:
                    major,
                    natural minor, melodic minor, pentatonic,and chromatic. However, a classifier with only five groups
                    brings more ambiguities. Thus, it was switched to FM synthesis. FM synthesis stands for frequency
                    modulation synthesis; the timbre (tone quality) of a waveform is changed by adjustingits frequency
                    with
                    a modulator frequency that is also in the audio range, resulting in a more complex waveform. This
                    new
                    tone can be described as &quot;gritty&quot; if it is a thick and dark timbre. For synthesizing harmonic
                    sounds,
                    the modulating signal must have a harmonic relationship to the original carrier signal.</P><P>With two types of culture plates, the program can be used to compare the sonification results from
                    each.
                    With a timelapse video for 2-3 days of the culture plates, it is also possible to listen to the
                    sound
                    change as the microorganisms grow.</P><P>Setup for camera module:</P></ARTICLE></SECTION><SECTION class="container"><HEADER class="special"><H3>Creating Audio files from the Microbiome.</H3></HEADER><ARTICLE><SPAN class="image 8u -2u 12u(mobile)">Mapping Method from Microbiome to Music. 5 discrete areas are shown and sonified.</SPAN><SPAN class="image 8u -2u 12u(mobile)">Squares of Distances from Colony Clusters to the Center in each area.
