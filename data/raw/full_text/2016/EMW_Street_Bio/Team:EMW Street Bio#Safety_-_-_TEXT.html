Safety
We are working in a BSL level 1 lab. The Cambridge Biosafety Committee has reviewed the projects we                     are                     undertaking in the lab. We provided the following lab safety training to students:
Good lab conduct
Follow all instructions so not to injure you or your colleagues
Do not horse around in the lab
Do not bring food, beverages, or tobacco products into the lab
Do not apply makeup in the lab
Do not eat or drink in the lab
Do not mouth pipet or drink any lab materials
Label your tubes properly (your name, date, sample name)
Do not work alone - only work when an expert is around
Personal protection
Wear gloves in the proper manner
Wear goggles in the proper manner
Refrain from wearing loose clothing and jewelry
Tie long hair neatly at the back of the neck
Wear shoes that enclose your entire feet
Legs must be covered, no shorts or skirts
Before beginning any lab activity
Know all the dangers associated with all materials (Check Materials Safety Data Sheet - MSDS)
Know the proper way of using and disposing of all the materials
Know all the protective measures
Do not use any lab equipment unless you are trained to use it
Do not perform a lab procedure until you are trained do so
BSL-1 safety
Biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) is suitable for work with well-characterized agents which do not cause                     disease                     in healthy humans (non-pathogenic). In general, these agents should pose minimal potential hazard to                     laboratory personnel and the environment. This level of biosafety is appropriate for work with                     several                     kinds of microorganisms including non-pathogenic Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other organisms not suspected to contribute to human disease (e.g. mouse cell lines).
Before leaving the lab
Leave it cleaner than you found it
Clean your workbench with disinfectant at the beginning and end of the lab exercise
70% ethanol for most cases; 10% bleach when working with bacteria and yeast (be sure you are                             wearing                             gloves!)
Household levels of cleaning agents can be poured down the drain; run water from the faucet                             for a few                             minutes afterward
Dispose of solid waste in designated container
Leave all equipment, samples, and reagents in the lab
Wash your hands with soap and water
Turn off lights and lock the door
Emergency Procedures
Know where all exits are located
If an irritating reagent splashes onto you, run affected area under water for 10 minutes and                         wash with                         soap
If a glass container is broken, notify the instructor immediately
Report all accidents and injuries immediately to an instructor
