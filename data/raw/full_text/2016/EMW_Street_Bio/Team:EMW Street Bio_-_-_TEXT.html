Concept
The combination of arts and science captures our imaginations with compelling narratives of                             initiative and innovation. People go beyond traditional ways to work in whatever medium best                             fits their skills and messages. By rooting stories in authenticity, people can spark emotion                             and action, transmit values and information, foster collaboration, and invent the                             future.
Lifeforms inhabiting the surface of our bodies need a form of communication for people to                             understand the information those lifeforms contained. What if we can hear the physical                             attributes of a microbiota? Music, as a universal language, suggests a certain wholeness.                             Sonification of the microbiome is an attempt to engage the public and provide a better                             understanding of the random nature of gene expression, cellular changes, and bacterial                             evolutions. Such an undertaking can bring personal understanding to what is going on with                             the surface of our bodies.
What if you could make music from your microbiota?
That’s what our community biology lab at EMW Street Bio wanted to find out.                             Our team has built a record player called Biota Beats that can hold a petri dish plated with                             cultures from the human microbiome. Currently, a still image is taken of the colonies and                             translated into sound by a program coded by one of our teammates, but the ultimate vision                             for Biota Beats is real-time tracking of colonies and conversion of a video into sound.
With Biota Beats, you’ll be able to listen to music from different cultures!
