Design Considerations
Given our motivation to have the sonification setup resemble a record player, it made sense to design                     the petri dish in the form factor of a traditional vinyl record. The standard types of vinyl records                     include Long Play Vinyl Records (LPs), Singles and Extended Play Vinyl Records (EPs), and Standard                     Play Records (78s). The standard diameters sizes are 12 inches, which typically play at a speed of                     33 ⅓ rotations per minute, and and 7 inch records, which are commonly played at 45 rotations per                     minute. It was decided to make both sizes in order to experiment with different surface area                     distributions and to plate a variety of teammates while being economic about material usage. The 7”                     record standard was kept, but the standard 12” record was scaled to the footprint of the Audio                     Technica record player that was hacked for this project. A typical LP hangs over the edge of the bed                     of the record player, but because of the uncertainty of the weight and stability of our petri                     record, the record was scaled to 10.47” in diameter (the exact size of the bed of the player with no                     overhang).
Distribution of Bodily Sites
A big design consideration was how to distribute the sites of different body parts across the plate-                     concentrically, from the center outwards, or consecutively, linearly as it rotates around. (See                     image below.) The concentric design has the benefit of a stronger resemblance to the iconic look of                     a traditional record and maintains the sonification of one body area over a longer period of time;                     one track is one body site. The consecutive model has the advantage of rapidly juxtaposing the                     different body sites over time, so one might discern the differences more distinctly. Both were                     produced for testing.
Fabrication
It was decided early on to construct our petri records out of acrylic due to its availability and                     watertightness. Records were produced with laser cutting for ease of access and speed of                     fabrication. The design for the record was modeled in a 3D CAD tool, Rhinoceros, and then laser                     cut.
One of the design constraints was the size of the material and our laser bed versus the size of the                     record. To build the walls of our petri dishes up, circular walls were stacked and glued. This                     resulted in a lot of wasted material (the center being discardable material). To be more economical,                     the walls were split in halves for more compact nesting on the sheet. The tradeoff to this was more                     labor.
Image of the laser file:
The green lines are cut lines, red lines are for etching for alignment and registration purposes, and                     the black lines are purely references for lid versus bottom and acrylic sheet size, not to be                     cut.
Assembly (October 1st)
After the file was cut on the laser bed, the protective paper was peeled and the parts were assembled                     along the etch lines of the base. A sparing amount of acrylic glue was applied with a syringe then                     pressure was applied until the acrylic bond set.
Finished products:
Things we learned in the process
Lids need to be smaller and as close as possible to the size of the bottoms
Use pipettes to "pour" agar and reduce contamination while creating standardization
Try adding small notches (5 or 10, around each of the radial plate design's ends) to be glued on                         the inside of the lid to prevent slipping of the lid and reduce contamination
Increase 1/4 inch dividers by an 1/8 inch
Possibly increase the height of the dishes
