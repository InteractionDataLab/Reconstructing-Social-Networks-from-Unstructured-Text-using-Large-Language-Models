David Sun Kong, PhD
David Sun Kong, Ph.D., is a synthetic biologist, community organizer, musician, and                                 photographer. He conducted his graduate studies at MIT’s Media Laboratory, receiving a                                 Master’s degree in nanotechnology and a Ph.D. in synthetic biology. He currently                                 conducts research at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory, where he is a world leader in developing                                 microfluidic, “lab-on-a-chip” biotechnologies. He was recognized as an emerging leader                                 in synthetic biology as a “LEAP” fellow, served as a guest faculty member at the Marine                                 Biology Lab in Woods Hole, and is managing faculty of “How To Grow (Almost) Anything,”                                 an international course on biotechnology. David is also the founder and director of EMW,                                 a community center in Cambridge MA with a mission of empowering communities through art                                 and technology. As a musician, David has performed as a DJ, beat-boxer, vocalist, and                                 rapper at hundreds of venues. His photography has been exhibited at the National Museum                                 of American History at the Smithsonian and other museums and galleries across the                                 U.S.
Keerthi is a Hellman Fellow in Science and Technology Policy at the American Academy.                                 Keerthi joined the American Academy after completing her Ph.D in Immunobiology at Yale                                 University. At Yale, she was the co-president of the Yale Science Diplomats, a science                                 policy group, where she helped develop a science lecture series for local high schools                                 and the general public, organized policy writing workshops and seminars, and contacted                                 legislators about funding issues concerning biomedical research. She is excited to be                                 able to continue her passion for STEM outreach through EMW Street Bio.

Mary Tsang
Mary 'Maggic' Tsang is an artist and biohacker working at the intersection of culture,                                 biotechnology, and civil disobedience. Her investigations challenge the role of creator                                 and creation, the ethics of the postnatural product, and the supposed promises of                                 science and technology. She holds a Bachelor of Science and Art (BSA) in Biological                                 Sciences and Art from Carnegie Mellon University and is currently pursuing her masters                                 in Media Arts and Sciences at MIT Media Lab, Design Fiction research group.
Shannon is a Research Assistant at the Neurobiology Department of the Harvard Medical                                 School and is currently pursuing a Masters in Bioengineering and Nanotechnologies with a                                 focus on microfluidics at the Harvard University Extension School. At Brown University                                 she studied Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and investigated the use of mesenchymal                                 stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles to treat liver damage from acetaminophen                                 overdose in mice. She recently has gotten involved with the DIY bio community spaces of                                 Boston and is having a wonderful time meeting new people through EMW Street Bio and the                                 iGEM competition.

Ani Liu
Ani is a speculative technologist, artist, designer and researcher. Her work explores the                                 intersection between technology, sensory perception, culture & implications of emerging                                 technologies. Her work has spanned the scales of built installations, prosthetic                                 wearables, virtual reality immersions, to synthetic biology, as she searches for the                                 epiphanies linking technological innovation with emotional affordance. Trained as an                                 artist at Dartmouth, an architect at Harvard, and now a ​researcher at MIT​ Media Lab​,                                 Ani continually seeks to discover the unexpected, through playful experimentation,                                 intuition, and speculative storytelling.
Viirj Kan is an interaction researcher and designer working at the intersection of                                 materials, chemistry, and robotics. She develops interfaces that connect humans to a                                 broad range of systems. Currently at MIT Media Lab, she researches new methods for                                 developing programmable biopolymers.

Rachel Smith
Rachel Smith is a biomedical engineer exploring processes of integrating biology into                                 materials and current fabrication processes. She hopes such mergers will spark brand new relationships and applications in which our materials may inherit the traits of sensing,                                 reacting, growing or cooperating organisms. Rachel has a long-time interest in engaging                                 people in the community with explorational biological engineering and the                                 demystification of genetic modification. She holds a Bachelor of Science from University                                 of Virginia, and is currently a researcher at the Mediated Matter group of the MIT Media                                 Lab.

Biology is humanity’s next technology revolution. The ability to re-engineer life on our                             planet                             has profound implications, from reshaping how we produce the medicine, materials, and energy                             we                             depend on, to augmenting humankind itself. Yet, the infrastructure for biological                             engineering,                             from organism design tools to DNA assembly to organism implementation, is nascent and                             largely                             confined to the laboratories of academia and corporations. Thus, we have an incredible                             opportunity, as the infrastructure for our bio-economy is being constructed, to move                             biological                             technologies from ivory towers and corporations to the street—to the youth, to the misfits                             at the edges of culture, to the communities that never dreamed of biology as a medium for                             creative                             expression.
Although Cambridge is an international hub for biotech, there is a disconnect between the                             science                             and the public. With Street Bio at EMW (East Meets West - a hub for technology, arts, and                             activism), we explore the interface between engineered biology and the street—the people,                             culture, and products that will shape how biology leaves the lab and enters our everyday                             lives.                             The concept was conceived in Summer 2015 by Dr. David Kong, a graduate of the MIT Media Lab                             who                             currently conducts synthetic biology, microfluidics, and digital fabrication research at                             MIT’s                             Lincoln Laboratory. Over the year students and professionals have joined the movement to                             create                             a biohacking space that was much needed in Cambridge.
