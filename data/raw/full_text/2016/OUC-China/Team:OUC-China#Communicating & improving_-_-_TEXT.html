CONSULT Dr. Xu
At the beginning of our project design, we met a tough problem of choosing chassis. We had two choices, B.subtilis and E.coli. The B.subtilis is a kind of Gram-positive bacterium and is more similar to our prototype---C.cellulolyticum, but the E.coli is more versatile and widely used.
We summarized our doubts and consulted Dr. Xu Chenggang, an expert in C.cellulolyticum research. Then we got the advice of comparing more differences that related to our design and he recommended us several useful software. In the process of blasting and comparing enzyme system between the two, we found that E.coli has no exoribonuclease that can digest mRNA from 5’ termini, which will be of great benefit to our whole design. With the help of expert and our deep research, we confirmed our chassis and went on with further design.

Then in September, we joined the CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee) held by SYSU, which is a communicating platform for Chinese iGEM teams. About 30 teams and 300 iGEMers from all over China gathered together. We shared our design with other iGEMers and we were glad that we received many specific responses, from constructive project design to detailed data process skills. Then according to those suggestions, we modified our original design and added two supplementary proof experiments, which was essential to the integrity of our project.
