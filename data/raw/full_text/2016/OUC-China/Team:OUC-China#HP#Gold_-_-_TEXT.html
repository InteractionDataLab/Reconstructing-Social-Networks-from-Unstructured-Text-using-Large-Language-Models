This year our team devoted to a novel regulation element, which makes great sense in synthetic biology but may be a little obscure for those who are unfamiliar with this field. Our regulation element works out through synthetic biology and then being acknowledged by the public. So our work was performed around three cores: our design, synthetic biology and public acknowledgement. And below are the diagrams of our project working mechanism.
Communicating and Improving:
Consult several experts of synthetic biology to evaluate our project or solve problems and then we improve our design according to the feedback.
Investigating and Promoting:
Investigate the popularity and public perception of our design as well as synthetic biology and devote to promoting them. By making videos on website and setting up our own official accounts in Wechat we promoted to the public .
Potential Application:
Do practical research and look for potential specific proteins that can be applied into our design to optimize industrial production.
