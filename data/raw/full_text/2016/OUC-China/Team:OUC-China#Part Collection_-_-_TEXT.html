We devoted to constructing a library of stem-loops to regulate the expression of protein and exploring a toolkit.
We tested both native stem-loops and designed stem-loops and we found some parts can coordinate the expression well. Therefore, we submitted these parts to iGEM parts registry with detailed characterization. Then, with the demands of bigger library and more detailed data, we collected these measured stem-loops with various folding free energy to work on constructing a toolkit.
