Upholding the principle of cooperation and sharing, we have collaborated with several iGEM teams this year. Mutual help from each other are listed in the following.
1.How we help others
Sincere assistance to the software of HFUT-China 2016
Experimental help to the high school team CIEI-BJ
Collaboration on human practice surveys with Munich United 2016
Participation in newsletter of XMU-China 2016
2．How others help us
Help from HFUT-China 2016
Scientific measurement from JNFLS 2016
Useful suggestions from Peking 2016
Mutual help makes us begin to scratch the surface of the collaboration’s potential and we look forward to a fruitful dialogue with more teams into the future!
1. HOW WE HELP OTHERS
Sincere assistance to the software of HFUT-China 2016
This year, HFUT-China designed a software named BioDesigner Coral, the purpose of which is to recommend biobricks to those exhausted by the countless literature. It is convenient to acquire the relationship between genes or parts and related diseases through visualization. Their project excited the attention of us and we had a close collaboration with them in various ways.
Once after their preliminary design, we were the initial users to test how the software worked, using our sequences and some detailed data on probation. Based on the results, we firstly concluded a meticulous report to feedback not only for parameter choice but also the literature analysis. Then we also suggested expanding the databases to a wealth of non-standard parts and collecting experimental data of more parts for more optimal protocols. Receiving our feedback, they debugged the system again, which has perfected their software to a broad use.
What's more, for better user interface design, we offered sincere opinions about the software we had employed in daily researches, such as Primer Premier 5, SnapGene, MEGA6, etc. Our feedback advanced their optimization about user design and therefore the software became more user-friendly.

Experiment help to a high-school team CIEI-BJ
This summer CIEI-BJ aimed to produce one of the key enzymes copalyl diphosphate synthase 1 (SmCPS1) which initiates biosynthesis of tanshinone, a famous Chinese medicinal herb, by building a plasmid transformed in Escherichia coli. However, for a brand new high school team, they are lack of parts and devices to practice, which is essential for their plasmid constructions. On the contrary, we have took part in iGEM competition with our own independent laboratory for at least six years, perfectly storing a wealth of parts and devices and inheriting proficient technology from our last iGEM team members. With great sincerity, we took an initiative to send them some parts (J04450 with backbone pSB1A2 and the splicing vector J23106 and I13504 with pSB1C3) for their daily practice and pre-experiments.

Collaboration on human practice surveys with Munich United 2016
Munich United 2016 released a survey about biotech and entrepreneurship. In order to cooperate with them for helping and promoting the success of iGEM participants, the scientific community and humanity as a whole, we finished their survey conscientiously. In return, we got the badge due to our contribution.
Participation in newsletter of XMU-China 2016
This year, XMU-China 2016 issued newsletter of iGEM which would help iGEMers from all over the world to share information about their projects and the latest news about synthetic biology in general. We were honored to collaborate with XMU-China 2016 to publish the survey of our project.

2. HOW OTHERS HELP US
Help from HFUT-China 2016
After optimization of the software with our suggestions, HFUT-China 2016 helped us characterize an essential component RNase E with high cutting efficiency, which had great influence on the decoupling of the upstream gene and downstream gene in our platform. In addition, they also sent us an important reagent LUDOX.
Scientific measurement from JNFLS 2016
In our project, the reference circuit is important for our data analysis and more accurate data are required for quantitative measurement of our regulatory element. JNFLS helped us to measure the fluorescence intensity of GFP and mCherry in the reference circuit using flow cytometry and plate reader. What's more, in accordance with our protocol, they suggested us to measure the fluorescence when the OD was up to 0.45, which solved our confusion of sampling time.

All the data is from the reference circuit. OUC-0 is without induction, OUC-1,OUC-2,OUC-3 is three biological repetition. GFP means the positive control. CKN is the negative control.

Useful suggestions from Peking 2016
We went to Beijing in May this year to communicate with Peking iGEMers. Not only did we acquire a wealth of useful suggestions about our project design but also their instructors helped us to process the data more scientifically.
