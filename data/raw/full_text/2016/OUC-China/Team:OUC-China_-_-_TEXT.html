ABSTRACT
Many applications of synthetic biology require the balanced expression of multiple genes. Our team aimed to develop a tightly regulated element to tune the expression of multiple genes within a polycistron. Inspired by the cellulosome of Clostridium  cellulolyticum, we concentrate on stem-loops inserted into the intergentic regions. When transcribed as one polycistron , digested and seperated into several independent fragments, cistrons with 3' end stem-loops varing folding free energy will get different stability. Thus it influences the amount of expressed proteins to realize cistrons concerto. As creative regulating method it is, we have measured and standardized a series of native and designed stem-loops, transforming into a toolkit for a broad use. Our modeling and software is the further exploration for this amazing mean.
