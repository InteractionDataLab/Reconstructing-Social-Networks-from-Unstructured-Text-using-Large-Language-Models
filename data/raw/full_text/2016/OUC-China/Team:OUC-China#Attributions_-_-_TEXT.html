This year OUC-China iGEM consists of 12 undergraduate students from different grades and different majors. We devoted ourselves to brainstorming our project, designing our project, doing our experiment and collecting and analyze our data by ourselves. We also modeled our project and created our own software.
Yu Jiang, captain of OUC-China iGEM 2016, was responsible for designing our project and whole experiment.
Zhixin Ma, vice-captain of our team, proposed the initial idea of our project and was in charge of detect the mRNA by using RT PCR and constructed circuits.
Yisi Wang, another vice-captain of our team, was responsible for submitting parts and also in charge of human practice and communicating with other teams.
Lijiang Fei, lab administrator, was in charge of construct circuits by using 3A assembly and detected the expression of proteins.
Wenqun Ding, another lab administrator, was in charge of detected the mRNA by RT-PCR and standardized parts.
Xiaoyi Fu, was responsible for communicating with other teams and detected the expression of proteins.
Yifei Li was the financial manager of our team and also responsible for extracting mRNA.
Zheyu Zhang was in charge of modeling and created our own software.
Wei yi, a member of our dry lab, was in charge of modeling.
Qian Chen, another member of our dry lab, was in charge of modeling.
Zexin Jiao, was responsible for constructing our website.
Ruimin Chen, our designer, was responsible for the design of our logo, poster, PPT, wiki and clothes.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
