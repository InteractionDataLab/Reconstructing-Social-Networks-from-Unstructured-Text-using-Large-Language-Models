This year, we devoted ourselves to the exploitation of new regulatory parts and the exploration of a kind of novel regulatory method. As a results, we constructed a series of stem loops with different folding free energy as a basic regulatory part, also a series of composite parts of fluorescent reporter system to test the the regulatory effect of various stem-loops.
Here is the summary of the parts that we constructed, some of which we have submitted to the registry.Characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device( BBa_I0500 )
