WHERE WE STARTED
In synthetic biology, microorganisms with modified metabolic pathways are employed as a reaction vessel to natural or unnatural products. It involves the introduction of several genes encoding the enzymes of a metabolic pathway[1,2]. Indeed, pathway optimization requires to adjust expression of multiple genes at appropriately balanced levels, for example the synthesic of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)[3] and Mevalonate[4].Similarly, manipulation of multisubunit proteins (for example F1F0-ATPase ) also requires coordinated expression of several genes to produce the subunits at the appropriate stoichiometries[5]. As is done in the prokaryotes, grouping a cluster of gene s into a single polycistron is a convenient mean for regulating genes simultaneously. Thus, for the sake of tuning the expressions of genes within polycistrons, we aim to develop a tightly regulated, predictable components –stem-loop to realize cistron concerto
LOOK CLOSELT TO THE EXISTING STRATEGIES
As a matter of fact, regulation of gene expression includes a wide range of strategies that are used by synthetic scientists, for examples copy number, promoters and RBS[6]. Despite their prominent advantages, it is nearly impossible to predict the necessary strengths of the promoters and ribosome binding sites (RBSs) to balance and coordinate the expression of multiple genes[7].What’s more, when traditional cloning is utilized, constructing libraries of  hundreds of configurations of pathway genes with varying copy number, promoter, and RBS strengths is a daunting and time consuming task even for small pathways[8].
Ergo, we are enlightened to try a rational design of one regulatory element to mainly reduce the number of trials and transform it into a user-friendly kit. We mainly focus on the prior design of the DNA sequences to work on the post- transcriptional level which can directly determine the relative levels of gene expression. Thus, stem-loop catches our attention.
INSPIRATION FROM NATURE
Nature is uncanny workmanship. Recently, in C. cellulolyticum, within an polycistron encoding  cellulosome, Xu reported that stem-loop structures associated with those intergenic post-transcriptional processed sites located at 3’ termini of highly transcribed genes exhibit folding free energy negatively correlated with transcript-abundance ratio of flanking genes[9]. Thus we consider the possibility of stem loops inserted in the intergenic region for tuning expression in E.coli which is more widely utilized as an engineered strain.
Fortunately, Keasling has identified that stem loops function well in the post-transcriptional process in E.coli[10], confirmed our thinking. Thus, we decided to develop stem loops with different free folding energy inserted in the intergenic region of two genes to coordinate expressions.
FOCUS ON THE DEEP MECHANISM
The operon is transcribed by its sole promoter and the primary transcript is cleaved into several secondary transcripts by RNase E, a single-stranded, nonspecific endonuclease with preference for cleaving A/U-rich sequence . However, the stability of these secondary transcripts against exonuclease degradation from the 3’ end varied due to their distinct terminal structure. When stem loops inserted in the 3’ end of the upstream gene, it protects its mRNA against the cleavage of exonuclease, increasing the ratio of abundance of the first gene product relative to that of the second gene product. Furthermore, the lower free energy of stem loops are, the more stable the secondary transcripts of the upstream are, tuning the expression of multiple genes.
OUR CREATIVE DESIGN
For further developing stem loops as useful regulatory parts, we racked our brains and  divided our project into two parts. First we exploited stem loops as new parts to tune the expression and transformed it into a user-friendly toolkit. SOLID data are carried out to confirmed its function. And then we explored more of this novel regulation method though modeling and software. More details in Design
FURTHER APPLICATION
After visiting some local industrial enterprises , we aimed to devoted our design into a practical industrial production, for improving product titers, yields, and productivity. In the fermentation of beer, the regulation of GSH, a reducing substance that is resistant to beer aging, contributes to increase the productivity of beer. GSH is composed of two subunits GSHⅠand GSHⅡ. Regulating the ratio of GSHⅠand GSHⅡ at proper stoichiometries results in higher yields . Thus, we are going to insert the stem loops with required free folding energy into the coding genes GSHⅠand GSHⅡto coordinate their relative expressions.
