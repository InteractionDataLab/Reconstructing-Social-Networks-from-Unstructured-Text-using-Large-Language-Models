We have developed our own software which provides a database of stem loops. When users upload their own sequence, the software can find out corresponding stem loops and store them into the database. Moreover, when users need proteins expressed in specific quantity, such as inputting the ratio of two different proteins, the software can provide suitable stem loops according to the ratio. The relationship between the quantitative expression of protein and the folding energy is based on our modeling.
With the help of this database, we can regulate the protein expression level more rationally, more precisely and more quickly. We believe that our toolbox will play a part in prokaryotic regulation field.
This database is based on Apache/PHP/MySQL environment. If you want to see our source code and operation guide. Please download this zip .
Here is our software handbook .
