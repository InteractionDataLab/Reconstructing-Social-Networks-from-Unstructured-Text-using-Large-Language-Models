SynBioBeta
Tsingtao brewery
Potential application
Besides improving and gradually popularizing our fundamental theory, we also paid attention to the practical application of our design.
Take part in SynBioBeta
In June, we took part in the SynBioBeta conference, an international conference focus on industrialization development in synthetic biology. We learnt a lot industrialization knowledge and got to integrating our design into practical applications.

Visit Tsingtao brewery
We visited several local enterprises in Tsingdao and explored potential industrial application of our design, from the company named Bright Moon Seaweed Group producing seaweed to the companies trade in fermentation production like Jimo Wine and Bacon Soy Sauce.
During this time we visited Tsingtao brewery, which was a world-famous local brand. We tried to apply our design, especially the concept of quantification into the production of beer. After deep communication with technicians, we learnt that quantification does have significant meaning in production and optimization of beer. For example, a reducing substance in yeast cell called GSH that contributes to the resistance to beer aging. The production of GSH is affected by GSHⅠand GSHⅡ.
Figure2. The production of GSH followed by GSHⅠand GSHⅡ
Therefore, we consider that our design can be applied into increasing the production of GSH by regulating the ratio of GSHⅠand GSHⅡ,which will eventually increase the productivity of beer. We displayed our design to Research and Development Department of Tsingtao brewery and now we are communicating with them about further cooperation.
