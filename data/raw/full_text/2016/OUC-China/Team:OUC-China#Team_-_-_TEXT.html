Here we are !
Here we are, we are OUC-iGEM. It has been 6 years since we first took part in iGEM in 2011. This time the team which is made up of 12 members pursues a more particular and creative aim. All the members met in May 2015 when we were unfamiliar with each other and knew nothing about synthetic biology. We struck to intergrate the related disciplines and during this time we became not only teammates but also good friends. We come from different colleges and have diverse specialties which ensure that we join our abilities and insights to make our goal clearer as efficiently as possible. All of us share one belief that our persistence and professional quality will guarantee the beauty of cistrons concerto.
