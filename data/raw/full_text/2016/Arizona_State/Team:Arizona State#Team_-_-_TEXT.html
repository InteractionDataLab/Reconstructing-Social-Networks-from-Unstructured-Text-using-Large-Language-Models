Brady Dennison
Brady Dennison is a third year biomedical                     engineering and microbiology student. He has been working as an                     undergraduate researcher at the Haynes lab for the last year and                     a half. His future goal is to incorporate more engineering                     principles into the microbiology field, and has had an awesome                     time doing so throughout the iGEM project. Outside of the lab                     (on the rare occasion) he loves to play piano, improve his                     woodworking skills, and go biking.
Brittany Flores
Brittany is a 3rd/4th year Molecular Bioscience & Biotechnology and Medicinal Biochemistry student at Arizona State University. She has worked in cancer immunology gene therapy and diagnostics in addition to cutting edge protein and DNA nanotechnology and crystallography lab, while working with Dr. Haynes since February 2016. She has also began a possible thesis project with Dr. Anderson at the Virginia G. Piper Center for Personalized Diagnostics. Her main goal is to attain her pHD and MD in neurosurgery in addition to conducting clinical research to advance immunology and cancer research. Brittany works with ASU teams building race cars, Arduino and Mars Rover Competition, enjoys playing the guitar and singing in a band, and participating in recreational archery competitions!
Ernesto Luna
Ernesto is a fourth year student at ASU studying medicinal biochemistry. Ever since watching Jurassic Park as a child, Ernesto has been interested in genome editing technologies. Nowadays, he’s caught up with learning all about the many forms of intercellular communication. Ernesto aspires to become a physician, but before that, wishes to contribute to the field of synthetic biology. When not running an induction, you can find Ernesto at the student recreation center playing soccer or on his couch binge watching a show.
Rob Schultz
Rob is a junior majoring in Biomedical                 Engineering at ASU. He is a member of the rugby team on campus                 and a leader in the Respect Movement. Rob grew up on the lake in                 Prior Lake, Minnesota where he used to dream of being a                 scientist one day. Now, he's excited that iGEM has given him his                 first opportunity to contribute to a project!
Jiaqi Wu
Jiaqi is a junior studying computer science and biological                     sciences at Arizona State University. She’s been an undergraduate researcher                     in The Haynes Lab for two years, and works as a part-time web developer at a                     Tempe startup. Jiaqi is particularly interested in the applications of computer                     science and software in biology, and hopes to work towards uniting the fields in                     the future. Outside the lab, she enjoys traveling, creating art and music, and                     attending hackathons.
Jimmy Xu
Jimmy is a junior at Arizona State University studying chemical engineering                 and molecular biology. Jimmy has worked at the Haynes Lab since Summer 2014 and also works in the                 Swette Center for Environmental Biotechnology as a research assistant. Jimmy is passionate about                 novel drug development and delivery and dreams of one day researching for the National Institutes                 for Health. Outside of his work, he loves playing basketball, pencil sketching, and boba milk tea.
Graduate Mentors
Cassandra Barrett
Cassandra is a second year PhD student                 at ASU in the Biological Design Program. Besides working with                 iGEM students, she spends her time in the Haynes' lab working                 on controlling chromatin dynamics in cancer cells. She is                 interested in mammalian synthetic biology, the relationship                 between epigenetics and neurodegeneration, and the use of                 synthetic biology in food. Outside of the lab, she enjoys                 writing poetry, roller derby, and participating in terrain                 races with her labmates.
Rene Daer
René is a sixth year graduate student in the Haynes Lab at ASU. At the bench, René is developing and testing protein tools to engineer human chromatin. One day, this work may lead to therapies that address disease at the chromatin level, rather than at the symptom level. Outside of the lab, she plays basketball, is a lifelong amateur guitarist, and enjoys an alarming amount of cheese. She's excited to mentor the ASU iGEM team because she loves sharing the joy of exploring new data with young researchers.
Faculty Advisor
Primary PI: Dr. Karmella Haynes
Karmella Haynes earned her Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics at Washington University, St. Louis. Her postdoctoral training focused on designing bacterial DNA for mathematical applications (Davidson College) and engineering synthetic proteins to control human cell fates (Harvard Medical School).
Dr. Emma Frow
Emma Frow joined Arizona State University in February 2015 as an assistant professor with a joint appointment in the School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering, and the Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes. Emma received her BA in Natural Sciences (Neuroscience) and her PhD from the University of Cambridge, UK. She spent two years working as a subeditor for Nature in London, and then re-trained in the social sciences, gaining an MSc in Science & Technology Studies from the University of Edinburgh. She completed postdoctoral research at the ESRC Genomics Policy & Research Forum at the University of Edinburgh and at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, before returning to Edinburgh in 2012 as an Assistant Professor in Science, Technology & Innovation Studies. Her research focuses on standards and governance in contemporary life sciences, with a particular focus on synthetic biology. She is currently working with colleagues in Edinburgh on a project called ‘Engineering Life’ (funded by the European Research Council), exploring the movement of ideas, promises and practices from engineering into the life sciences. She also serves as co-chair of Policy & Practices for the international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition.
Dr. Jeremy Mills
Jeremy Mills is an Assistant Professor in the School of Molecular Sciences and The Center for Molecular Design and Biomimetics in The Biodesign Institute. He obtained his undergraduate degree in chemistry from Vanderbilt University where he studied free radical atom transfer reactions with Prof. Ned Porter.  He then carried out graduate studies focused on protein engineering with natural and unnatural amino acids at The Scripps Research Institute under the guidance of Prof. Peter Schultz. He comes to ASU from the University of Washington where he carried out postdoctoral studies in the field of computational protein design with Prof. David Baker. Research in the Mills group focuses on the use of computational protein design methods to engineer proteins in which non-canonical amino acids carry out important functions.
