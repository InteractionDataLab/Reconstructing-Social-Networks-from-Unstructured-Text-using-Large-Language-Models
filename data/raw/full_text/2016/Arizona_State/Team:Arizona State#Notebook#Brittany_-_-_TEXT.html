"Gas Chromatography/Mass Spec, etc. (investigate on campus resources, protocols for sample prep, best growth phase for HSL production, HSL stability, etc."
find articles with HSL stabability
find a MALDI machine / similar
Idea
- create protocol/method how to extract/ purify HSL molecule from LB media in order to take the mass spec of it on MALDI.
- this would then yeild the concentration/ strength of the HSL molecule that is being used in the crosstalk.
- the stabability would be further tested by the degradation of the HSL molecule after being added to the Reciver bacterial population.

Brief outline of a Potential Protein Purification+ Mass Spec. Protocol
- the HSL media would have to be placed in a buffer exchange to switch the media.
- then placed in HPLC to be purified (find out if the molecule is a protein to use correct machine)
- HPLC needs a max and a min absorbance cxn (for settings) [look that up in articles? or past exp.]
- HPLC check reasonable absorbance rates online
- Then use lyopholizer to further purify the sample. [ the machine dries out all the volatile compound leaving just the pure protein sample.
- MALDI take a mass spec of the sample.
- sample must be in H20 or a certian buffer.
- find out what type of matrix can be used for the sample to "fly" best into the machine. [article]
LAST: save results from HPLC + MALDI

1.
Took out the pipette tips out of the tubs before spinning them down
2.
Spun down the media for 10 minutes at max (13.5 rpm).
3.
Decanted the supernant
4.
Re-suspended the pellet with resuspension buffer, ( 200uL) and place into a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube
5.
lysis the cells -  with 200 ul of the lysis solution.
a.
mixing the contents by gently inverting the tube 6-8 times.
I.
lysing of the cells shouldn’t take longer than 5 minutes.
6.
Neutralization of the cells by adding 350 uL of the neutralization buffer.
a.
mixing by invention of the tube 4-6 times.
7.
The solution is centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes for the “sticky” to remain as a pellet at the bottom of the mixture.
8.
prepare a column where, 500uL of the column preparation solution is added to the tubes/ columns
a.
tubes are spun down at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute to clean the column.
9.
Then the cleansed lysate cells (supernatant) is pipetted into the columns.
10.
Centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute.
a.
discard the followthrough.
11.
Add 750uL of the wash solution into the column.
a.
centrifuge at 12,000rpm for 1 minute

centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for one minute.
DNA concentration
~Did a nanodrop version of the DNA concentration
tubes 1,2,3,4
88, 84, 72, 78 ng/uL
which means that i got about 20% yield…. according to previous DNA can should be 400ng/uL
Gel electrophoresis
in order to check to see if there was any DNA plasmid in the transformation. and if anything was recovered during lysis of the cells and plasmid prep.
●
1 % agarose gel.
●
1 ladder, and a postive control, the rest were the samples.
●
Results: no plasmid…

- So if the HSL molecule comes from the LB+ampicilin then by spinning the media down the pellet would be the wanted cells.
- then the pellet can be transferred into a smaller tube, and then the cells can be lysed.
- once the cells are lysed then they undergo a LLE procedure.
- and the HPLC can further purify ...ect...

2.
Add 30uL of DH5alpha turbo cells to each tube with appropriate sample (2uL of LuxI, LuxR, EsaI, water)
3.
Incubate on ice for 10min
4.
Heat shock at 42C for 35sec
5.
Incubate on ice for 2min
6.
Add 750uL of SOC media (RT) to each tube
7.
Shake 37C for 1hr
8.
Plate on LB+Amp (Spin down at max for 1min, remove 200uL of supernatant, resuspend and plate 100uL)

Plate induction- slow version (higher yield) (source-goldbio.com)
1.
From a relatively fresh plate, pick a colony and grow overnight at 30°C (or 37°C) in 1-2 ml LB+Antibiotic  in a 15 ml tube on a rotator or shaker.
2.
Dilute 1:50 (1:100 if 37°C overnight) in 2 ml LB+Antibiotic and grow 3-4 hours at 37°C in 15 ml tube in a rotator.
3.
Prepare 1 ml LB+Antibiotic+1mM IPTG in a 15 ml conical and prewarm to 37°C about 10 minutes before use.
4.
After 3-4 hours remove 1 ml from tubes at 37°C and place in labeled 1.5 ml tubes. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 seconds at RT and remove supernatant. Freeze pellet at -20°C until
needed. THIS IS THE UNINDUCED CONTROL.
5. Add 1 ml LB+Antibiotic+1mM IPTG (prewarmed to 20°C) to 15 ml tube and incubate rotating or shaking at 20°C for 12-16 hours. This will get the final volume back to 2 ml and the final concentration of IPTG to 0.5mM
6. After 12-16 hours, transfer 1 ml from induced sample to labeled 1.5 ml tubes and centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 seconds at RT and remove supernatant. Freeze pellet at -20°C until needed. THIS IS THE INDUCED SAMPLE.
7. Sample preparation for SDS-PAGE: Add 100 μl of 1X Loading Buffer  with 1% BME to uninduced and induced samples. Vortex the samples for 10 seconds to 1 minute or until there are no clumps of bacteria. Boil the samples for 3 to 5 minutes. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 seconds at RT and load 5-25 μl (usually 10 μl) depending on gel (amount of protein, size of pellet, Western, etc.).
Cloning Inducible Promoter
Introduction
Our quorum sensing receivers consist of two parts: the transcription factor and the inducible promoter. The transcription factor senses HSLs in the system and if present, binds with the inducible promoter to then activate GFP. For our project, we have four more receivers without inducible promoters: Las, Bta3, Exp, and Cer.

LasR, Bta3R, CerR, and Expo (for Sin). For   all of these, I have the MRV + transcription factor cloned. They are missing   the inducible promoter part.
I’ve tried LasR_MRV + pLas for a long time,   and I am still in the process of troubleshooting it. For the others, I could   not find the inducible promoters parts.        Ryan has gBlock tubes for these inducible   promoters in his box, but they are empty? If you would like to take a look,   they are in rows 9 and 10 in the QS Receiver cloning box (right side of the   -20 freezer).
--> did he order primers?
amplify and clone!!! :D
amplify the primers with pcr, and ligation -- long transformation and sequencing.
