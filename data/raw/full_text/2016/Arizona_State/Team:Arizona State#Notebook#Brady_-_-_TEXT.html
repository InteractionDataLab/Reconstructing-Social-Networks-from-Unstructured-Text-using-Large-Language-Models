Wednesday, 6/8/16
10 ul of water
.5 ul of DNA (LuxI in this case)
30ul of BL21
Incubate on Ice for 10 min
Warm Plates thorughout all of this, and label during incubation
Place total content onto center of plate
Add a few glass beades
Swirl in infinity style
Remove beads (Special container, they are recycled)
Place the plates into 37 degree Celsius Incubator

●
Took out transformed plate, selected 4 colonies and labeled them (1-4).
●
Created 4 15 mL tubes with 4 mL of LB Amp, and labeled 1-4.
●
Took a plate from the fridge, and divided it into 4 equal parts, and labeled 1-4.
●
Using a pipette tip, took some bacteria from seleced colonies, then streaked onto plate, then added the pipette tip to the appropriately labeled 15mL tube.
●
Placed tubes into shaking incubator overnight, placed transformed plate into fridge, and placed the newly streaked plate into 37 degree incubator.
