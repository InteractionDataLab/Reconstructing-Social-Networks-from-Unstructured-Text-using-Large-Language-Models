Tape tubes to 37°C shaking incubator for 45 minutes to recover
Remove from incubator and pellet in centrifuge. Discard the supernatant
Add 100uL of LB broth with antibiotic that matches selected plates
Pipette total mixture onto plates with antibiotic. Spread with glass beads
Incubate overnight at 37°C
[3] Miniprep
The miniprep kit that was used was the Sigma-Aldrich GenElute Plasmid Miniprep Kit. The used protocol can be found here
[4] Site-Directed Mutagenesis PCR
Both primers (25-45bp) must contain the desired mutation and anneal to the same sequence on opposite strands of the plasmid
Melting temperature must be calculated from the equation: Tm = 81.5 + 0.41(%GC)-675/N, where N=primer length (bp) and %GC is the GC percentage in the primer (~40%).
Create reaction mixture below, plasmid should be in excess (~125ng)
Run reaction in thermal cycler with settings below
Run gel verification
Digest samples with DpnI to remove any residual nucleic acids
Run the long transformation protocol with heat shock on LB+Amp plates

[5A] Liquid-Liquid Extraction
Grow 5ml of sender in 10mL culture tube
Remove 1mL of culture media
Centrifuge at 8500g for 10min
Add 5uL of 10uM d9 C5HSL to 1mL of acidified (0.01% acetic acid) ethyl-acetate
Add the 1mL of Ethyl Acetate + HSL to sender media
Vortex for 1 minute
Remove the organic phase
Repeat the extraction procedure, without the addition of the HSL (just ethyl acetate)
The ethyl acetate extracts were evaporated to dryness using rotary evaporation
Samples were stored at 4 degrees Celsius
[5B] High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
After the liquid-liquid extraction, the AHL sample was purified using HPLC. The HPLC device that was used was located at the BioSurface Facility at ASU's Biodesign Institute, which has the model HP1100 Preperative/Analytical HPLC. The protocol for this machine can be found here .
[5C] Gas Chromatography
BL21 E. coli expressing Sender plasmids were grown in 6mLs of LB+amp overnight. After 12 hours, HSLs were extracted three times with 1mL of ethyl acetate. BL21 E. coli expressing the Modular Sender vector (no HSL synthase) was used as a negative control. Samples were analyzed by GC-FID.
