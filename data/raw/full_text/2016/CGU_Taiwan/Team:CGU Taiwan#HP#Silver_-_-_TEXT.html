Human Practices
In 1796, the term "vaccine" was introduced when Edward Jenner found that cowpox virus could be used as vaccine to prevent smallpox, a global epidemic disease. Before smallpox vaccine was found, around 400,000 people in Europe died of smallpox every year. Many more people were blind or disfigured due to smallpox infection. However, this life-threatening disease has been completely eradicated after development of the vaccine more than 200 years ago. The discovery of vaccine also helps to ensure that infectious diseases, such as poliomyelitis, measles, and hepatitis B, are under control.
Nowadays, researchers are still struggling to find more suitable vaccines for other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Huge amounts of resources were invested to develop and improve vaccines production. Because most vaccines are used in developing or undeveloped countries, the cost of the vaccine should also be considered. The value of vaccine industry is highlighted in Investing New: “the global market for vaccines may only comprise about 2% to 3% of the total pharmaceuticals market but this sector has, and continues to experience a stellar growth rate of 10% to 15% per year versus the 5% to 7% seen in the overall market, according the World Health Organization (WHO). Totaling just US$5 billion in 2000, today the global vaccine market is worth an estimated $24 billion and is projected to rise to $100 billion by 2025.”
Acknowledging the importance of vaccines, the CGU_Taiwan 2016 iGEM team wants to know more about the vaccine industry. In the meanwhile, we would like to understand whether Leijuvant , the new concept of adjuvant, will provide a new approach in vaccine research and development.
Our goal:
Vaccine development is a lengthy process from bench work to market. It involves intensive research in biotech company‘s R&D Department, clinical trials in hospitals, and public education. We contacted all three major groups in Taiwan to get a complete picture of concerns and regulations on vaccine development as well as the current market demand.

Our project
In order to make more people aware of our idea, we planned various integrated human practice activities. There are three major routes that we took to achieve this goal. For “SURVEY”, we got feedback and comments from both professional experts and general public on the feasibility and acceptability of our Leijuvant product, respectively. For “EDUCATION”, we investigated public awareness of vaccination and educated them on the significance of vaccination. For “COMMUNICATION”, we set up academic exchanges with other iGEM teams all over the world and collaborated with them.

Welcome to our human practice paradise throughout Taiwan. Since the beginning of 2016, we have been to different places for our integrated human practice plan. We visited many companies, schools, hospitals, institutes, social organizations, and foundations. Numerous experts, students, citizens, iGEMers have become bonded with us, the CGU_Taiwan iGEM team. Just click and look inside to follow our journey and to get an in-depth view of our achievements in human practice.
