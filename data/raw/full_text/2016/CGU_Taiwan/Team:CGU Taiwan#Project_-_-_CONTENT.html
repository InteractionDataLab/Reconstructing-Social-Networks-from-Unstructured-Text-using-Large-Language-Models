HTML is a product of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) which is a complex, technical specification describing markup languages, especially those used in electronic document exchange, document management, and document publishing. HTML was originally created to allow those who were not specialized in SGML to publish and exchange scientific and other technical documents. HTML especially facilitated this exchange.

One of the authors of this book works at CERN - the cradle of the Web - and the Web is starting to be used as a platform for electronic publishing. One crucial part of a publishing platform is missing, however: there is no way to style documents. For example, there is no way to describe a newspaper-like layout in a Web page. Having worked on personalized newspaper presentations at the MIT Media Laboratory, HÂ Ã¦n saw the need for a style sheet language for the Web. Style sheets in browsers were not an entirely new idea.</P><H3>Week 2 (5/9~5/15)</H3><H3>Week 3 (5/16~5/22)</H3><H3>Week 4 (5/23~5/31)</H3></LI><LI><H3>Week 1 (5/1~5/8)</H3><P>JavaScript was originally developed in Netscape, by Brendan Eich. Battling with Microsoft over the Internet, Netscape considered their client-server solution as a distributed OS, running a portable version of Sun Microsystems' Java. Because Java was a competitor of C++ and aimed at professional programmers, Netscape also wanted a lightweight interpreted language that would complement Java by appealing to nonprofessional programmers, like Microsoft's VB. Developed under the name Mocha, LiveScript was the official name for the language.
