Hsu,Chien-Yu (Ditto)
Chien-Yu has the face totally like Ditto! Chien-Yu is an eager and quick leaner which could fit in anything with Ditto style smiling face! She mainly helps our modeling, codes CSS and javascript of wiki pages, makes a McHug demo video and designs jamboree PowerPoint. A kind and helpful person always gives the hands to any team members who are in need.
Lu, Ying-Hsuan (Charmander)
When she is jogging, you will find out that she is a Charmander style runner. She starts up and leads the team. A product animation producer, wiki writer, back up for team communication and industry visit, PS designer, and also carried out in vivo experiment. Not very thoughtful and even crazy sometimes but is willing to embrace all comments and advice.
Chang, Chia-Wei (Abra)
Abra employs psychic ability even while sleeping. Chia-Wei seems to also have this psychic power to keep on carrying out experiments, however unlike Abra she stays up until the sun rises up. She leads our biobrick design, construct, and debug. She is also very hard-working and highly concentrated on doing everything which helped our experiment to start a lot more smoothly.
Liao, Tzu-Chieh (Dratini)
Tzu-Chieh is just as cute as Dratini, and also a strong back up! Major in biomedical science but built up the whole McHug prediction platform codes! He has brilliant ways of thoughts, extraordinary technique of Western blotting, and a talent for every kinds of accent thus also represents for our jamboree presentation.
Yen,Da-Li (Slowbro)
He makes others think of Slowbro due to the atmosphere around him. He is also a professional Leishmania keeper. He handles crucial steps such as transfecting target vector into Leishmania by electroporation and drug selection. Trying different condition and discussing again and again with teachers, he finally succeeds and becomes a great troubleshooting Leishmania trainer.
Hsu, Justine (Snorlax)
She wants to let Snorlax to be her buddy and stand on her shoulder, but she doesn’t have one. She sleeps and eats like Snorlax (No, I don’t), however a non-eating and non-sleeping person during iGEM project. Like a native English speaker and represent our team to jamboree presentation. Also our team wiki contents writer and editor, in vivo experiment operator, and an earnest supporter for our team.
Lu, Min (Vulpix)
She is as keen as Vulpix. Like a problem sensor that quickly finds the logical mistake, stops our crazy ideas and keeps our feet on the ground. She also keeps an eye on our team accounts and expenses cautiously. She specializes in virus which helps a lot with our project design. With a sense of art and being good at InDesign, she also draws a logo for CGU_Taiwan and DMs for jamboree.
Ku,Yu-Chang (Arcanine)
He really likes Arcanine so let him be the cool Arcanine once. He leads the experiment group, learns and modifies the protocols, collects the laboratory supplies, and cultures lots of Leishmania. He also has a special headlamp with mystical power that can photo-inactive the Leishmania. This step is extremely crucial to the safety of our product!
Wang, Yu-Yan (Wigglytuff)
Like Wigglytuff, she is very soft, outgoing and easy to get along with. These personalities make her an excellent Human Practice agent. She deals with our HP education, including in Science Carnival and our biomedical science freshman orientation. She also participates in interlab project.
Lin, Bin-Tse (Blastoise)
He evolves quickly from Squirtle during the iGEM project. Spokesperson for our project and take any effort in fundraising. And popular with high school student during Yilan Senior High School education, an interlab operator, HP wiki writer and laboratory supplies collector. Also a contact window toward other teams for communication.
Liu, Tzu-Li (Electabuzz)
He is Electabuzz just because he majors in electronic engineering. And it is a big work for him to understand and catch up with biology stuff. But he is a good asker and helps for modeling. He provides lots of resources including 3D printer and camera to help us print our product and taking group photos.
Our Team
Our team consists of 11 members majoring in biomedical sciences or electronic engineering to represent CGU participating in iGEM. We are resourceful, thriving on challenge and eager leaners. Everyone brings what he or she has learned into full play. After interdisciplinary brainstorming for several months, we hope to contribute to the society and world by providing another possibility of adjuvant during the iGEM project.

iGEM is a highly-cost competition, so that we have no choice but to go around canvassing and collect requisite capital for iGEM. There are four parts in our total budgetary, including registration fees, experimental costs, transportation & living expenses, and others. Our project will require extensive DNA work and large-scale antibody test. The required reagents count significant cost to our budget; the actual cost varies depending on the results and progress. Any remaining funds will go towards being used in personal registration fees to MIT (USA) Jamboree where we present our project, and living expenses later.
At first, we think how we could get subsidized by others? Then we wrote request letters for small donations and emailed them to the faculty of Chang Gung University and thousands and hundreds of biotech-associated or –unassociated companies. In the letter, we described, “your small donation will do help us achieve our goals and support the CGU iGEM team in the years to come. The desire to win glory for Taiwan impels our team to work more diligently. Finally, we are going to contribute to the world by our ultimate outcome.”
Additionally, we participated in the plenitude of seminars, lectures, and exhibitions, like Joint Annual Conference of Biomedical Science in Taiwan and numerous academic seminars held in the CGU, so that we could have a direct contact with managers or agents of the companies to ask them for assistance.
