Basic Safety At RHIT
All of the members of the iGEM team have a required lab safety training before stepping into in lab on campus. This is usually provided by the instructs. As a refresher, our PI reviewed all this safety before we started working in the lab. We followed safety protocols that follow Bio safety level 2 lab protocol.
Project Safety
One of the only major dangers in our project was mounting our cells onto a slide. Because of the need to see the fluorescence of the cells, we used a method of mounting that required paraformaldehyde. Paraformaldehyde will often react to form formaldehyde which is thought to cause cancer. It also can cause skin, eye, and respiratory irritation. To combat the dangers of the formation of formaldehyde, we double gloved, wore respirators, and used a chemical fume hood.
