MITO-MORHPIN' POWER YEAST!
Controlling Translation in Yeast Mitochondria
Saving the world one cell at a time
Welcome to Team RHIT's iGEM 2016 Wiki!.
Our Project
Our project focuses on how to control the aerobic respiration of yeast cells by manipulating the expression of mRPS12.Without mRPS12, yeast mitochondria lack a functioning ribosome and become unable to produce proteins necessary for aerobic respiration.  By expressing the mRPS12 protein in a haploid mRPS12 knockout strain, we investigated its usefulness as a means of regulating aerobic respiration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  This project is a continuation of the RHIT 2015 iGEM project, Mitochondrioff.
