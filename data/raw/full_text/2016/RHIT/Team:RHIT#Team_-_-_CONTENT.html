He teaches cell and molecular biology, genetics, and genetic engineering. He has also developed a sequence of courses designed to introduce any Rose-Hulman undergraduate to synthetic biology. Dr. A. is a strong proponent of using synthetic biology and iGEM as mediums for interdisciplinary education of undergraduates. &quot;Synthetic biology has the potential to address many of humanity's grand challenges. iGEM provides rich opportunities to foster creative and critical thinking skills, and the aptitude for innovation, interdisciplinary collaboration and team work necessary to realize the discipline's full potential&quot;.
