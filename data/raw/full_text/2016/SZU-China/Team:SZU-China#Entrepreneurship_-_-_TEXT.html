Hydrogen Production from Chlamydomonas Reintmrdtii
This year, our team draw our attention to the cleanest energy---hydrogen. Since there are almost no green ways to produce hydrogen efficiently, our team try to work out a biological way to keep producing hydrogen in efficiency.To achieve the aim, we choose Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii, a kind of green algae.
