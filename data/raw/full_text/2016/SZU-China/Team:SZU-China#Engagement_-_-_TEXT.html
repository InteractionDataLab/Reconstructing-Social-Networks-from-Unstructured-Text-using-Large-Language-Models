Introduction
SZU-iGEM team have two types of engagement:Online and Offline. For online, we found a Wechat account to spread the synthetic biology knowledge，also a WeiBo account to let more people know about us. In addition we add our stories on the subject contest web which belongs to our university’s official website to let our professors and students learn more details about us. For offline engagement we went to several villages in Hunan province and the villagers did 300 questionnaire, and we made 200 booklets on science knowledge to handout to them, while we also did a science lecture, bringing them science knowledge they never knew before. After that we gave the primary school students a lecture. They definitely think synthetic biology is a great thing after that and asked us tons of questions. In addition we made a speech for the freshmen of our university and the majority of them want to join the next year’s iGEM.  Besides we also attended Asia-Pacific Conference and Central China iGEM Consortium.

Lecture in YueLiangwan primary school
Besides the science lecture we held in the village, we also went to YueLiangwan primary school. We did a presentation there on our project and other science knowledge. The students there did listened really carefully and asked us a lot of questions. We answered a lot for them. The presentation did brought up their interest for science. One of the students even told us firmly that she want to be a scientist in the future.
Lecture for freshman year student
There are a lot of freshmen year students in our school want to know more about and iGEM. So we did a lecture and share our stories. And so many of them want to join us the next year.
Attending Asia-Pacific conference
In August, 2016, SZU-China was invited to attend the Asia-Pacific conference held by team NCKU- Tainan. There were 20 universities took part in the conference from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
It was a great opportunity to improve ourselves. All the teams brought their posters and excellent presentations. When it’s our turn, we gave presentation for 20 minutes, then the Q and A lasted for more than 40 minutes. The questions raised by other teams were worth thinking and some of them were even challenging, which drive us to think and do more. The feedback really did helped us to make a better design for our project. A lot of them asked about what our device really looks like. The answer we could gave back then was really vague. But now we do have a video for that as you can see in our HP Gold page:

Besides practicing our oral English and sharing science knowledge, making friends with other teams was the fun part you can never miss.
Attending Central China iGEM Consortium
In September, 2016, SZU-China took part in the Central China iGEM Consortium held by team SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY. There were 28 teams from all over the China. There are presentation part and poster part of the consortium. The presentation was consist of 20 minutes presentation and 10 minutes Q&A. The suggestion given by the students and the teachers was useful. A lot of teams came to our poster to ask questions. We gained a lot of information by talking to other teams about their posters. The poster sharing can last forever if no one stop us, for the knowledge we exchange with various teams was really serviceable.
Wechat account
In order to let more people know about us, we set up a Wechat account. As we do some HPs, we keep updating the record of our story. This is the most common way for Chinese students to gain their information.
Weibo account
Similar to the Wechat account, we create a weibo account. In this way, we can promote our project and introduce our events so that more and more people pay attention to our competition and give us more important guidance. Different from Wechat, Weibo is not mainly for just the students but also people all over the world.
Subject contest web
The subject contest web, which belongs to our university’s official website, records our important events to let our professors and students learn more details about us. By this means, our professors will provide more useful advice for us.
