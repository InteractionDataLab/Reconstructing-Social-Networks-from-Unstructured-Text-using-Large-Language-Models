This is what we've done!
1． We established a light-mediated expression system, followed by the example of yeast two-hybrid system, to produce miRNA which can shock the photosynthesis of C. reinhardtti ，so that the hydrogen can be produced in the hydrogenase. Click more
①we use the gas chromatograph to measure the concentration of hydrogen production, to verify the practicability of our system
②We verify that, after use the GC to measure the hydrogen, the light-mediated system is workable, and the CRY2 can bind with CIB1 specifically.
③We proof that, as the algae hold two conditions, the system is supposed to be safe
2． We design two kinds of miRNAs to regular the photosynthesis of C.reinhardtti, alongwith the highly reactive hydrogenase, the algae can produce hydrogen. Click more
①We designed two kinds of miRNA, to specifically regular the translation of key proteins of PSII, to finally produce hydrogen.
②As the hydrogenase in algae is restrict anaerobic, which is the main difficulty we have to overcome at the beginning, we designed miRNAs to stop the oxygen production in order to produce hydrogen.
③We provide a workable solution to shocked the photosynthesis of photosynthetic bacterial, which provides a great reference.
3. For our project this year, we constructed and testified 13 biobricks, including the 4 devices and 5 composite parts. Click more
①We have done the codon optimization, so that our biobricks can be perfectly used in both E.coli and C.reinhardtti.
②We’ve submitted two absolute new biobricks- paro and hyg- which are antibiotics.
③We’ve submitted our designed miRNA, D1 and FNR.
4. We establish a new method for transformation of reinhardtti based on the existing one, which we called glass-based method.

①Further more, we select the cellwall-deficient reinhardtti for easy transform.
②Using our new mehod the plasmid was perfectly transformed
③We even helped FAFU-china team to transform their plasmids, as they are used the same cell, reinhardtti.
5. We built a model for practical application, taking a first step to provide a solution for household power supply. Click more
①We conceived a series of devices, using our algae to produce electricity for household
②We field in four villages in Hunan province, south China, investigating the usage of rural area, to optimize our model.
③We also film a video in a rural family and finally make a flash to illustrate our model
