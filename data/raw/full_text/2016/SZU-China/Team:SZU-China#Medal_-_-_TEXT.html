Bronze medal
1.  Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
2.  Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page (section 3). MORE
Team Wiki: Teams need to document their project on their Team Wiki page.
Poster: Each team must present a poster of their project at the Giant Jamboree.
Presentation: Each team has 20 minutes to present their project at the Giant Jamboree. The presentation must be given by a student.
Project Attribution: Teams need to attribute all of the work done for their project correctly. We  attributed  all  our  work  done  for our project correctly  and in detail,  more information  could  be seen  in the Attribution site .
Registry Part Pages: Teams must create and document Part pages on the Registry for the Parts they make. We registered all our submitted parts on the Part page, and more information could be seen in the Parts site .
Sample Submission: Submit DNA samples of your new Parts to the Registry. We have submitted DNA sample by completing the submission form that is provided in this part.
Safety Forms: We have finished the safety form more information could be seen in the Safety site .
Judging Form: We have finished the judging form.
3.  Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions  must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). You  may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a  previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part's main page.
  
We submitted: BBa_K1884001, BBa_K1884002, BBa_K1884003, BBa_K1884004, BBa_K1884005, BBa_K1884006, BBa_K1884007, BBa_K1884008, BBa_K1884009, BBa_K18840010, BBa_K18840013  as our new standard BioBrick Part. MORE
Silver medal
1. Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #4. Submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Part numbers are: BBa_K1884007 , BBa_K1884008, BBa_K1884009, and BBa_K1884001.
More information could be seen in the Parts site .
2. Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synthetic biology problem.
This year,our team has in-depth collaboration with three university teams:FAFU-CHINA,SUSTech_Shenzhen,SYSU-CHINA and two high school teams:BGIC_China and SMS_Shenzhen.  More information could be seen in the Collaboration site .
3. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as HumanPractices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. (See the Human Practices Hub for more information.);
We visited companies and village to improve our project.We also made a video of the prototype of our system, more information could be seen in the Human Practice site .
Gold medal
1. Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. See HP Overview site
2. Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry. Please see theRegistry Contribution help page for help on documenting a contribution to an existing part. This part must NOT come from your team's 2016 range of part numbers.
  This year, we submitted BBa_K1884001 (The GAL4BD-CIB1: a fusion protein in light-mediated expression system ), which is the improvement of the BBa_K1592005 (GalBD-CRY2：a different form of fusion protein).We also submitted BBa_K1884002 (The VP16AD-CRY2: a fusion protein in light-mediated expression system, we optimize codon in this gene in order to transcript in green algae stably), which is the improvement of Part:BBa_K1592006(GalAD-CIB1：a different form of fusion protein) and BBa_K105001(VP16 - eucaryotic activation domain）. More information could be seen in the Parts site .
3.  Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrickdevice; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept. (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab.) See the result of our project.
