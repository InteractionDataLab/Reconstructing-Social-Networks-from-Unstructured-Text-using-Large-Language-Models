The great advantage of our project is the simple fabrication method, which works at room temperature, without utilizing complex machines, instruments or toxic chemicals. The basic ingredients ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles, are included in tooth paste and sun screen. Tea can be used as a dye to absorb visible light and transfer electrons to the nanoclusters. The nanoclusters are fabricated by adding the initial salts to biofilm which results in a semiconducting layer. In contrast to our environmentally friendly solar cell, the production of commercially available solar cells requires much more resources and energy. Furthermore, their fabrication yields toxic byproducts, which can be circumvented by our methods. No one can resist the beautiful colors of dye sensitized solar cells.
