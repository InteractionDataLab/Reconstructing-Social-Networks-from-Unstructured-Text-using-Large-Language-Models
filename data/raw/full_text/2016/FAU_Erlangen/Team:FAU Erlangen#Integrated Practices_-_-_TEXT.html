In our Human Practice project, we covered both the chemical and biological part of our work. In the chemical half, we manufactored solar cells together with high school students. We further explained the basic concept of our dye sensitized solar cells. The biological half consisted of a seminar talk at the same high school where we conducted the practical school lab course mentioned above. We demonstrated the basics of biotechnology and genetical engineering to an educated audience including students, teachers and parents. We illustrated our own work using a home made cartoon, which was very well received by the attendies. During both educational events at the high school we enjoyed great resonance and feedback from the public audience.
