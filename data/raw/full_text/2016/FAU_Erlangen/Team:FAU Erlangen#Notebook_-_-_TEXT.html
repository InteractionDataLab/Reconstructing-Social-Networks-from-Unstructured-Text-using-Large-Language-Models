09-27-2016
New digest of minipreps from 09-16-2016
Gel: Tried another tube with NEB 2-log DNA ladder (left side of gel, right side: same one as before)

Gel test, linearized pQE-9, pSB1C3, gBlock CsgA-ZnO, gblock CsgA-ZnS
Bands have wrong sizes again. However, there is a second, fainter ladder visible, which appears to indicate the correct sizes.
Something is wrong with the ladder in our setup. Maybe due to adding gel stain prior to casting the gel?
09-29-2016
New test: ran two gels, one stained precast, one unstained
Stained: wrong sizes, unstained, correct sizes → earlier fragments were likely correct

https://www.embl.de/pepcore/pepcore_services/cloning/cloning_methods/chemically_compet ent/.
10-03-2016
New test digest of overnight cultures with EcoRI/PstI. Gel looks like the last one, but better contrast.

Preparative digest of pQE-9, pSB1C3, new CsgA-ZnO, ZnO SpyC, new CsgA-ZnS.
Due to inattentiveness, the gel was shaken before loading and vector samples spilled over to to other wells. Due to this, the vectors were not excised.
The other three bands were excised and purified together with the five samples from the day before.
The purified fragments were than ligated with pQE-9 or pSB1C3 backbones.
NEB-5-alpha cells were transformed with the ligations, plated and incubated overnight @ 37°C.

Vector and insert were ligated overnight @ 4°C.
Picked colonies from the plates from the day before. Inoculated in 2ml LB + antibiotic, incubated @ 37°C overnight
10-11-2016
Made competent cells E. coli BL21(DE3) for expression of HaloTag-SpyCatcher construct.
Transformation of competent BL21(DE3) cells with HaloTag ligation.
Plated, incubated overnight @ 37°C
Miniprepped the overnight cultures, test digest with EcoRI/PstI. Gel was allowed to run a bit too far,
so some of the constructs are not visible.
Found colony on mApple plate. Inoculated overnight culture.
10-12-2016
No colonies on plate.
Mineralization: discarded supernatant, rinsed FTOs: White layer sticks to FTO surface with biofilm, easy to wipe off everything else.

Chemistry/Physics
Zn(NO3)2 x 4 H2O, Zn(Ac)2, Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C16TAB), NaOH and KOH were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All experiments were carried out in ultrapure water. The synthesis of ZnO microflowers is similar to a synthesis performed by Zhang et al. (2004). 0.5 g of Zn(Ac)2 were added to 110 mL of a saturated C16TAB aqueous solution under stirring. After 10 min of stirring, 10 mL of a 2 M NaOH aqueous solution were added under stirring, resulting in a white aqueous solution maintained at 110 °C for 1 h under reflux. The white solid was centrifuged, washed with distilled water and ethanol until no foam was present after shaking. Finally, the white sediment was dried at 60 °C under vacuum.
The mineralization process was related to a process developed by Umetsu et al. (2005) and used by Tomizaki et al. (2012) to produce ZnO nanofibers. A 0.1 M zinc nitrate solution was mixed with the same volume of 0.2 M KOH. The produced Zn(OH)2 was sonicated and centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded and the sediment was resuspended with distilled water of the same volume. Using the 0.1 M Zn(OH)2 stock solution, solutions with a concentration of 0.02 M and 0.05 M were prepared. Solutions of 0.1 M, 0.05 M and 0.02 M were added to the freshly prepared biofilms (for preparation description, see the biological part). After three days, the biofilms were separated from the solution, washed with distilled water and dried at room temperature.
