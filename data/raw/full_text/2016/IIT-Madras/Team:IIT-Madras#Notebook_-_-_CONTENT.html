We started working on experimental designs. We finished writing our protocol, which contains complete description of our parts, experiments with timeline. We designed sequences for IDT gBlocks and placed the order. We made a list of consumables required for our microbiology and molecular biology work and ordered them. We prepared Ultr-competent cells using Inoue method. We started ideating for our modelling part of the project e.g. problem statement, hypothesis, statistical toolbox etc. 
</P><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="June">June</SPAN></H1><P>We started our cloning work and successfully cloned parts required for our 'Noise in Device' experiment. We finalized our modelling section and finished writing hypothesis, model etc. We started reaching out to other iGEM teams for the possibilities of collaborations. By the end of the month, we started planning for Interlab study.
</P><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July">July</SPAN></H1><P>We contacted HKUST, HonkKong iGEM team, we shared our project plans to each other over skype. We also talked to IISc Banglore and sent our biobrick to them for characterization. We started our modelling work and finshed getting results in form of raw data. We finished Interlab Study by this month. We started planning on our outreach and human practices activities. We got our IDT gBlocks and finished cloning 'RIBOSON &amp; RIBOSOFF' parts. We took fluorescence measurement for 'Noise in Devices' parts using plate reader.
</P><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="August">August</SPAN></H1><P>We started working on tri-stable switch model of HKUST. We finished the analysis part of our modelling and  presented it to Dr. Karthik Raman, expert in Systems Biology. We attended SVCE iGEM meetup and indian igem hangouts. As planned for human practices work, we started reaching out to public via survey. We also reaching out to the very vocal and anti-GM NGOs in India. We were appoached by Paris Bettencourt team for untreated hydrophillic cotton fibers, which we shipped to them. We started working on our game 'Codonut'.
</P><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="September">September</SPAN></H1><P>We started cloned sgRNA gBlocks by IDT. We faced difficulty in cloning these parts. We ran the gBlocks on 1% agarose and found most of them to be sheared. We shipped the required cotton to team Paris Bettencourt. We performed our FACS measurements for our constructs. We interviewed experts on GEAC, India committee. We finished the making of game for Android and Apple phones. We finished analyzing our GMO survey. We started working on our wiki.
</P><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="October">October</SPAN></H1><P>We brainstormed about the methods of teaching synthetic biology to school children. We reached out to two school  and educate them about synthetic biology. We also talked to public about their awareness on GMO, tried to find out the difficulty in their understanding of GM technology. We finished our wiki.
