Analyse, decipher and control cellular computation.
NOISE IN DEVICES
Exploring noise in devices to understand and predict their behavior. Intrinsic noise in devices seems to increase with increase in protein expression levels irrespective of constituent parts e.g. different RBSs and promoters.
RIBOS
Designed and experimentally validated the functionality of RNA Inducible Boolean-like Output Switches (RIBOS) for better control over gene expression. Now, get RIBOS devices for your own genes.
TRANSLATION SCORE CALCULATOR
Designed and validated an empirical model to predict the variations in translational score of RBS parts. Now, you can get protein expression levels for your own expression system!
