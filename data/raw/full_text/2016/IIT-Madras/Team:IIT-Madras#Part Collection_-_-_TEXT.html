Part Collection
Noise in Devices
We have made this part collection to help future iGEM teams to screen less noisy parts This part collection contains a set of parts, which would prove very useful in the measurement of intrinsic and extrinsic noise in current and future biological devices. Simultaneously, this part collection would help in efficient characterization of the strength of biological parts and devices. This part collection contains dual fluorescent reporter proteins (BBa_K1956014, BBa_K1956015, BBa_K1956017, BBa_K1956018, BBa_K1956019, BBa_K1956020, BBa_K1956021) under different promoter and RBS parts, which can be used for improved characterization of noise and strength in other biological devices by expressing a different protein e.g. cfp to make tri fluorescence reporter protein system. Also, this part collection contains a set of promoter-RBS composite parts (BBa_K1956001, BBa_K1956002, BBa_K1956003, BBa_K1956004), which can be used to  characterize different proteins in biological devices. A composite part, BBa_K1956016, can be used to characterize such promoter-RBS composite parts, ribo-switch parts etc. Therefore, this part collection is very specific and valuable in it's deliverable to part registry.
sgRNA library
We have made a set of sgRNA parts ranging from K1956006-K1956013 for KanR, CamR and mCherry genes. These parts would be helpful in estimating the strength of CRISPR with different Cas9 protein in different organisms apart from various other purposes.
