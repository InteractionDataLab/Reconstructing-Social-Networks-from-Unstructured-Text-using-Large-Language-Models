Achievements
Gold Medal
1. Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
We have documented our work at HP Gold page .
2. Improve the function OR characterization of an existing iGEM project (that your team did not originally create) and display your achievement on your wiki.
We significantly improved the characterization of many parts .
3. Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab.)
We have a functional Proof of our project.
Silver Medal
1. Validate that something you created (art & design, hardware, software, etc) performs its intended function. Provide thorough documentation of this validation on your team wiki.
We have characterized our parts: BBa_K1956014 , BBa_K1956015 , BBa_K1956017 , BBa_K1956018 , BBa_K1956019 and BBa_K1956020
2. Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synthetic biology problem.
We have collaborated with many teams. Please visit our Collaborations page.
3. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. (See the Human Practices Hub for more information.)
We have documented our HP Silver work.
Bronze Medal
1. Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
We registered as an undergraduate team, spent our summer learning and executing synthetic biology. We are attending Giant Jamboree.
2. Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page (section 3), except those that specifically mention parts.
We met all deliverables
3. Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisers, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
We have attributed everyone, who have contributed to our project, while clearly specifying their role and work.
4. Document at least one new substantial contribution to the iGEM community that showcases a project made with BioBricks. This contribution should be equivalent in difficulty to making and submitting a BioBrick part.
We have documented a total of 21 parts in standard plasmid backbone. Please visit our Parts page.
