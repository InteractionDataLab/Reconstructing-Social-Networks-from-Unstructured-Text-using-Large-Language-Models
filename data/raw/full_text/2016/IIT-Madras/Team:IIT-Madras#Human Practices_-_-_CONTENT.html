We believe an informed decision can be made only when everyone is heard, and their views carefully contemplated. We proceeded to perform Education and Public Outreach based on the knowledge we gained from the survey and interviews.

This prompted us to investigate GMO related issues by reaching out to it's stakeholders, general public (consumers and farmers), NGOs and regulatory authorities. We conducted a survey among undergraduates, graduates and professors (330 responses) of colleges in four states of India. We interviewed two highly vocal NGOs, Gene Campaign &amp; ASHA, and two members of GMO related decision making government body. To educate farmers about GM crops and its implications, we prepared a write-up in their local languages, and circulated it among farmers using social media. In order to spread awareness in public sphere about Synthetic Biology, we made a mobile game 'Codonut' (released on the App Store and the Google Play store) to educate players about the concept of codon bias. We also organised an interactive synthetic biology session for students in a high school near our campus and primary school students in a village in Maharashtra.

We wondered if we could teach this concept with the help of a fun mobile game. We believe games can truly help people of all ages understand core concepts underlying day to day phenomena in a lasting way. This was how the game was born.
</P><P>In the game, the player guides the ribosome character by tapping on the screen(thus lifting him up). The player must not hit the upper or lower bounds of the playing area(represented by the lipid bilayer). As an analogy to codon bias, we decided to use donuts, with ribosome preferring chocolate donuts above all others(who doesn't love chocolate?).  If you have yet to play the game,  you can download it on the <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.appstore.com/Codonut">App Store</A> or <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.igemiitm.codonut">Play Store</A>.
