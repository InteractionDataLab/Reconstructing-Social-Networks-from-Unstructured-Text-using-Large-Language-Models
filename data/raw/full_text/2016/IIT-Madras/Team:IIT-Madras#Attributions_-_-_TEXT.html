We'd like to thank everyone who supported and helped us over the course of the last few months, not only for making iGEM possible, but for guiding us and helping our idea come to fruition.
The Team
Nitish is a final year Biological Sciences student and the leader of our iGEM team, and extremely passionate about Synthetic Biology. The design of the RIBOS switch was his brainchild. He has excellent experimental knowledge both in wet lab and computational work. Nitish loves cloning, and he snapped up every opportunity he got to perform them.
Venkat is a final year Biological Engineering student. He worked with Nitish on several experiments, including measurement studies, plasmid isolations and computational modelling. He also wrote the code for our mobile game, and helped set the design and style of the wiki and its content.
Karthik is a third year student of Biological Sciences who is a beginner in Synthetic Biology. He mostly contributed towards the design of graphics, wiki and the game Codonut (for Android). He also lent a hand to the human practices work that was taken up.
Gopinath is a third year student of Biological Engineering, out to explore Genetic Engineering. He led the human practices activities, including the survey, conversations with government bodies & NGOs, awareness campaigns and interactive sessions in schools.
Nikhita is a second year student of Biological Sciences, a Synthetic Biology enthusiast. She was involved in graphic design and the GMO survey. She has had a great learning experience so far and hopes to contribute more to iGEM in the upcoming years.
Nikunj is a third year undergraduate of biological sciences, who is an enthusiast in Molecular Biology. He helped in wet-lab experiments. Under human practices, he conducted a session on GM crops for primary school children in a small village in Madhya Pradesh.
