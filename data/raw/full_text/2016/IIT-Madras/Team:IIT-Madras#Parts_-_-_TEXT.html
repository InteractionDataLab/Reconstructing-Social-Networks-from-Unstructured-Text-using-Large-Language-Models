Composite Parts
We made and submitted a total of 21 parts in standard plasmid backbone, pSB1C3. These parts include Promoter-RBS composite parts, dual fluorescence reporter devices, RIBOS devices and sgRNA parts. To know more about the characterization and functionality of these parts and their future applications.

Part Collection
We have submitted one part collection for efficient characterization of devices e.g. noise & strength. This part collection contains 12 composite parts. To know more about the characterization and functionality of these parts and their future applications.
