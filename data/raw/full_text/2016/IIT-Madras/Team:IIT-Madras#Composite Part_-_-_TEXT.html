Composite Parts
We made and submitted a total of 21 parts in standard plasmid backbone, pSB1C3. Our composite parts can be summarized into following categories: 1. Promoter-RBS parts: We have made a combination of promoter-RBS parts, R0011 with B0030/31/32/34. Part ranges from BBa_K1956001 , BBa_K1956002 , BBa_K1956003 , BBa_K1956004 .
2. Dual fluorescence reporter devices: We have made six devices ranging with different promoter-RBS parts producing GFP and RFP proteins. Part ranges from BBa_K1956014 - BBa_K1956015 , BBa_K1956017 - BBa_K1956018 , BBa_K1956022 - BBa_K1956023 .
3. RIBOS devices: We have cloned RIBOSON, BBa_K1956019 and RIBOSOFF, BBa_K1956005 , BBa_K1956020 , BBa_K1956021 devices to test their strength and functionality.
4.sgRNA parts: We have constructed sgRNA coding parts for mCherry, CamR and KanR genes. There parts are: BBa_K1956006 , BBa_K1956007 , BBa_K1956008 , BBa_K1956009 , BBa_K1956010 , BBa_K1956011 , BBa_K1956012 , BBa_K1956013 .
Best Composite Part
Dual expression vector, BBa_K1956016 , device has been made to enable user clone their promoter & RBS parts with this device to achieve efficient characterization, i.e. noise and strength, for their parts and devices.
