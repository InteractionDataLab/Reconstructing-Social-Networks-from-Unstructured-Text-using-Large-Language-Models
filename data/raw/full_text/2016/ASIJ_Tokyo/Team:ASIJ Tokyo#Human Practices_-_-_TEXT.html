Research Presentations
We will be presenting the results of our project to members of the Synthetic Biology course at our school, in order to demonstrate the skills in transformation and plasmid construction that we acquired through experiments and lectures in class. We will also be sharing our project with a panel of administrators from our school, in order to raise awareness about the real life applications of synthetic biology in the Japanese community.
