Safety Information
E.Coli
We chose to use the E. coli strain K-12 as our chassis organism. In our experiment, we also worked with a synthesized DNA sequence found in the bacterium Ideonella Sakainesis called PETase.
Risks
E. coli is a risk group level 1 organism, so there is relatively low risk associated with our experiment. To further minimize risks, our group followed safety level 1 procedures. We washed our hands after every experiment, disinfected lab benches, and apparatuses. We also worked under biosafety cabinets. To the extent of our knowledge, the bacteria does not pose a risk to human health. Therefore, we believe that the project poses minimal to no risk if developed into a real product.
