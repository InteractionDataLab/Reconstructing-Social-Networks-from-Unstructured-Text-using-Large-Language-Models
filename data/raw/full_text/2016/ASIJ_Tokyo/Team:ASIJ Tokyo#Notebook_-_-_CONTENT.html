                             August 23rd 2016 - Competent Cell Check
                         </H3><UL style="list-style-type:circle"><LI>First day in the lab! (After a cancelled meeting due to a typhoon day!)</LI><LI>After researching all of the second semester and summer and coming up with a general protocol, we were ready to begin our whole experimenting process. We caught up on everything that we had done (as all of us hadn’t seen each other throughout the whole summer due to a lot of trips). </LI><LI>During the summer we had decided to use three Anderson promoters due to the variety of strengths they come in and versatility (as they are able to be used in a lot of different situations.</LI><LI>We came up with three strengths of promoters: weak, medium, and strong</LI><LI>Our weak promoter had a strength of 0.33 (BBa_J23110)</LI><LI>Our medium promoter had a strength of 0.58 (BBa_J23111)</LI><LI>Our strong promoter had a strength of 1 (BBa_J23100)</LI><LI>We had also decided to use the C-Osmy tag because we knew that it would be the tag with the best fit for western blot (to track). However we realized later one that we wouldn’t have time for that.</LI><LI>For our N-terminus end we had decided to use myc-tag.</LI><LI>Although no real lab work was done a few of us got together to discuss what vector and linearized backbone we would use</LI><LI>Chose to use pSB1C3 (found in the iGem catalog) for our Gibson assembly as it was already in the distribution kit and would work with our project </LI><LI>We started and finished most of the competent cell test for our e. Coli cells to check its efficiency. We chose to do this before our whole experiment began to make sure that we were using working e. Coli cells.
</LI><LI>So we completed that lab up until the final step, which was to count the number of colonies that would grow. </LI></UL><H3>

</LI><LI>We decided to PCR the promoters and buffer (for Gibson Assembly) to make sure that we wouldn’t run out of promoters (since they are crucial to our experiment)
</LI><LI>Ran the PCR for 30 cycles to clone enough parts</LI><H3>September 2nd 2016</H3><LI>We transferred  E.

</LI><LI>Consistency issues in data, gains in mass a problem 
</LI><H4>Mass measurement procedure: 
1. Taken from tray, put on scale
2. Measure and record mass

3. Put it into its appropriate E. Coli suspension
</H4><LI>It’s suspected that our stock, because it wasn’t initially maintained well, produce E. Coli that are dying, so we will replace our stock on Monday
</LI><LI>We should do Western Blots to check for PETase in supernatant 
</LI><LI>In a few days we need to create a myc-tagged assembly (Gibson assembly), perform transformations for new plates — ultimately for new stock suspensions — and, once all that is done and we have new stock, start trial 2 with new PET and fresh E. Coli
