I have lived in Japan my whole life and have been at ASIJ since 6th grade. In the team I am mainly working on the wikipage. </H5><EMIN><DIV><H3>Emin Lee</H3><H5> Medicine is my core passion, but I enjoy learning various fields of science, including bioengineering. I struggle to identify myself in terms of &quot;where I am from&quot;; my DNA tells me I am Chinese, but my nationality is Malaysian. However, I was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan, and I go to an American school, but English is not my first language. Albeit my ambiguous origins, I can easily identify what I enjoy in life. I have played the violin for 14 years and piano for 3 years (I am 17 at the moment). I enjoy playing music as a way to escape from stresses (such as trying to explain people where I'm from). I enjoy being a part of this team's building project, contributing as a co-leader. I look forward to how this idea will expand as well as our maturation as people and as teammates.</H5></DIV><KIEN><H3>Kien Malarney</H3><H5>I am 17, and I am from Tokyo, Japan.
