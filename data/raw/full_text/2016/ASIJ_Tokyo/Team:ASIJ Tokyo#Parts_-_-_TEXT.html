Parts
Anderson Promoters
Relative Strength: weak (0.33) BBa_J23110
Selected as a relatively weak promoter against which to compare the expression of the PETase construct
Relative Strength: moderate (0.58) BBa_J23111
Selected as a relatively moderately strong promoter against which to compare the expression of the PETase construct
Relative Strength: strong (1) BBa_J23100
Selected as a relatively strong promoter against which to compare the expression of the PETase construct
Tags
N-OsmY
Fusion proteins with an N-terminal osmY have been shown to successfully secrete proteins of interest out of E. Coli
C-Myc
This C-terminal tag would allow the PETase construct to be more easily detected by Western blot assays for expression
Others
PETase sequence
Gene that coded for the PET hydrolase
Plasmid backbone
The pSB1C3 backbone is recommended
High efficiency E. Coli cells
Hosted the PETase constructs
Parts Submitted
Gibson-assembled pSB1C3 with novel fusion osmY-PETase A1 (BBa_K1885001)
This part offers efficiency in the initial step in the bioremediation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET): the production of metabolizable monomers (ethylene glycol and terephthalate) through hydrolysis. PETase catalyzes the hydrolysis of PET into terephthalate and ethylene glycol monomers. The N-terminal osmY protein and its signal peptide fused to PETase, with serine-glycine peptide’s repeating intervention, serves to secrete PETase out of the cell (this reacts with PET in the cell's local environment). The Anderson promoter, with a relative strength of 1 that precedes the fusion protein in the plasmid, serves to constitutively express the fusion PETase, enhancing the degradation of environmental PET. This part utilizes the pSB1C3 backbone and confers resistance to chloramphenicol.
