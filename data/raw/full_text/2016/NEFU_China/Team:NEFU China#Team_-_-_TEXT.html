Collabration
Collaboration with NEU_China
This year our iGEM team have developed cooperative relationship with NEU-China team，we have reached an agreement that to help each other examine the effectiveness of the biobricks.
Our team undertakes a few experiments to test whether the EGFP we received from NEU-China can be successfully express in E. coli.
Firstly, We digested the sequence of EGFP form pEGFPN2 vector with restriction enzyme KpnI and NotI. Secondly, we insert the sequence into pET14b which is commonly used as a prokaryotic expression vector.
vector.
The bands located at 720bp, it is equal with the length  EGFP coding sequence, this  gel graphic indicates that we had successfully cloned EGFP                 Then we transform the recombinant vector into E. coli. We had observed green fluorescence from the transgenic E. coli under a fluorescence microscope.
Collaboration with SJTU software
We have connected with SJTU_software. Their project is a social network service (SNS) platform or iGEMers, it provides service for team-team ommunication and laboratory management in teams. When the service is presented online, iGEMers can seek cooperation and share files through their platform. SJTU_software invited us to help them to test the website and give them some advice. We were offered a beta version of their website. Then we gathered several team members to try out their service and gave some useful advice.We are very pleased to have this cooperation with SJTU_software.
