Introduction
Human practice is an important part of iGEM. This year, we mainly focused on the safety and marketing of our project. We did some survey on hospitals and medical service,from which we found that hospitals in China still had serious problems. We also interviewed some doctors about their perspectives on our project and they thought it was with potential. Besides,through our surveys,we are confirmed that our project is safe enough to be brought to the public.
We started from a questionnaire which inquirs attitude the public towards our project. Most people said they were willing to use it.
Besides, we took part in some activities and meet-ups to make us presented to the public, introducing them about iGEM and out project, and discuss with other teams. Take a look on what we have down on human practice.

Medical service: Medical service and hospitals in China today are facing serious problems and people feel it difficult to get medical help, especially physical tests. On account of this, we came up with our project, hoping to help them get early diagnosis. Follow us to see the current situation of hospitals in China.
