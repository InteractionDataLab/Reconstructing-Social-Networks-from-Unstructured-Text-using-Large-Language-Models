Combination and use
At the very beginning of our project, we have already have a plan to turn our project into real product that can help people diagnose themselves easily at home. We suppose the product to be a small plate of dry yeast. After time t which is used to activate yeast, one can add urine sample to the product and place his smartphone to detect the light intensity at specific time using our mobile application.
Our modeling works are exactly aiming to solve the core math part of the product-using process. The yeast activation part correspond to the userâ€™s waiting time before use, and the yeast luminescence part correspond to the calculation in our mobile application based on the detected light intensity and the yeast number calculated in the yeast activation part.
So actually our models are for combination use and for real product use.
