Project
Given characterization of the expression of Nano-lantern (cAMP1.6) downstream different promoters
Modified the sequence of a previous part BBa_K209472 (ADRB2) to make it biobrick compatible and verified its membrane localization in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by adding His-tag to its C termunus
Constructed the yeast glucose sensor (SMT-pCN, SMT-pGN and SMT-pAN) for glucose solution and urine sugar monitoring successfully
Constructed the yeast epinephrine sensor for epinephrine solution test successfully
Established a freeze-drying process which can be carried out to store our engineered yeast cells in an active-dry form
Proposed further plans for improving the stability of biosensor and expanding the range of detectable molecule.
Model
We made a model to know how the number of yeasts changes by the time after woken up from the dry status.
We made a model to get the value relationship between the amount of glucose/adrenaline put into yeasts and the light intensity.
We developed two core parts of the math work of our future product.
Human Practice
We analyzed hospital medical service in China today and showed it, both by searching literatures and inquiring at hospitals.
We improved and explored our project by listening to professors’ and doctors’ proposals.
We proved our product would be accepted by the public by doing a questionnaire.
We introduced igem and synthetic biology to the public by entering some activities.
We collaborated with other two teams.
