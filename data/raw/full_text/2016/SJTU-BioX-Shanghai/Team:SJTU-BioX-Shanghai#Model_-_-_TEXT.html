Model
Description
This year our model is tightly related to our project and our future plan. We make two different models considering different problems.
The first model, the yeast activation part, is aiming to give out a regular pattern about how the number of yeasts changes by the time after they start to activate and grow from the dry status. This part is mostly related to our future plan to make our yeast into a diagnose product.
The second model, the yeast luminescence process part, is a simulation of the yeastsâ€™ luminescence process itself. This model is mostly used to forecast the light intensity according to the amount of glucose/adrenaline put into the yeasts.
And after all, the two model we develop have extra function while combined together. This part is discussed in the third part of our model pages.
