Instructor
Lin He: The supervisor of our team and the direct of Bio-X, who gives us funding and university-related support. He initiated the first team and support us since then.
Gang Ma: The supervisor of our team and the professor of Bio-X, who gives us advice and instruction. We fought together dealing with all of the hard problems.
Yushu Wang: She spent a lot of time and energy on us, helping all kinds of problems, and she especially do us a favor in providing support for part submission.
Advisor
Zhiping Xie: Professor Xie and his lab provided us with powerful knowledge as well as the facilities for operating on yeast. We can’t thank him too much as he indeed do us a large favor
Can Yin: The former SJTU iGEM project leader in 2015, he offered us help in molecular cloning and initial knowledge in iGEM competition.
General support
Research institute of Bio-X: During the whole preparation procedure of the iGEM competition, Bio-X offered us a great support in all aspects. Thanks to their providing of experimental funds and drugs.
Shanghai Jiao Tong University: Our university gives us logistics support for the whole project. Thanks for the substantial support given by our university.
School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University: During the whole experimentation, School of Life Science and Biotechnology provided us with experimental funds, laboratory and experimental apparatus.
Yeast strain support
Dan Li in Zhiping Xie’s lab: Thanks Dan Li for providing us with the initial deficient strain, which we named SMT, with genotype MATα his3Δ leu2Δ lys2Δ ura3Δ;pho8Δ60,pho13Δ,trpΔ (unpublished).
Plasmid support
Dan Li in Zhiping Xie’s lab: Thanks Dan Li for providing us the genomic insertion vector for TRP1, HIS3 and LEU2 locus insertion.
Tongji iGEM team: Thanks them for providing us with the plasmid backbone pSB1C3.
Imaging support
Jie Zhang in Gang Ma’s lab: Thanks Jie Zhang for providing us knowledge in using Graphpad Prism 6 and ImageJ for data plotting and analysis.
Dan Li in Zhiping Xie’s lab: Thanks Dan Li for providing technical details in using fluorescence microscope.
Cloning support
Md. Rezaul Islam Khan: The PhD here in Bio-X, he taught our members how to conduct molecular cloning and providing us with his advice on our project.
HP support
Professor Shi J from School of Bioscience and Biotechnology: Thanks for supporting Safety parts.
Professor Liang R from School of Bioscience and Biotechnology: Thanks for supporting Bioethics parts.
Doctor Sun from No.9 Hospital: Thanks for supporting Hospital Experiencing parts.
Doctor Zhou from No.9 Hospital: Thanks for supporting Hospital Experiencing parts.
Other
We also give thanks to all other teachers and fellow students who supported us in either experiment or brainstorming in Bio-X. Without their help and encouragement, we cannot hold up to the end.
