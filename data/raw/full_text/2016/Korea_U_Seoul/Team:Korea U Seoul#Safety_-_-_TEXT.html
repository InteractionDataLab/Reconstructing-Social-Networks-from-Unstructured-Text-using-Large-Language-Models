Safety
Our project include expressing a set of agar degrading enzymes, and diaphorase in E.coli. We also use shewanella oneidensis MR-1.
1, Agar degrading enzymes are highly unlikely to be dangerous. Its only function is to degrade agarose. They are expressed in strain of E.coli, BW25113, which is classified as risk group 1.
2. Diaphorase is also highly unlikely to be dangerous. It is often used in EFCs to generate electricity. They are expressed in strain of E.coli, BL21(DE3), which is also classified as risk group 1.
3. Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a non-pathogetic species which is classified as risk group 1. It is often used in MFCs to generate electricity.
All of our parts and organisms are not dangerous. However, we do use few dangerous materials such as EtBr. When we  are handling those dangerous materials, we always use gloves for protection. We also always sterilize biological wastes by autoclaving to prevent biological materials from spreading.
