                       Hello. I am Jiseng Lee. I have been a vice-president and head of human practice team. Also, I am responsible for fundraising in Korea U Seoul. The project that we are undertaking would have significant impact not only on synthetic biology field but also on our daily life.  As result, empowering the knowledge of potential risk to the public is crucial. I have been conducted several works related to informing critical impact of greenhouse and our project as alternation of energy crisis solution.

                       Hi, I'm Kyujin Jeong of Korea U seoul. I'm in charge of most of the experiments we've done this year. This is my third year participating in igem but sadly, I won't be in the jamboree this year. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this year's igem. Have fun!

                      I've been working on overall works such as HP, wiki, ethics and so on. Preparing this big competition for a long time, i have learned a lot of things from all KUAS teammates. 
I really appreciate them and thank to get an opportunity to participate in iGEM. Whether the result will be good or not, there will be no regret because we did all our best for this competition. 
I'll never forget this precious experiences for life.

                       I've been involved in human practice part, mainly participating with outreach and public engagement. I’m responsible for financial management, including sponsership. I've also been part of ethics activity, carrying out interviews and conducting seminas. For last, I contributed for the team’s brochure and presentation design.

                       Hello, my name is Eun San Ko. Last year, I began prepping for iGEM international competition in hopes of broadening my scope and perspectives on Biology. During the first journey, I participated in various experiments and assisted in producing a software. Now on my second year, I am in charge of advertising and fundraising for the competition. Although I started out barely knowing anything about Synthetic Biology and Biofuel Battery, I was able to grow my expertise on those fields through my experience with IGEM. Not only was I able to gain academic knowledge from the experience, but also, I was able to build bonds with numbers of people who have helped me through the competition. I would forever cherish my relationships with KUAS teammates, guidance professors, and other supporters. I truly believe it was for their support and care that I was able to overcome all the hardships that I encountered during the competition. All in all, IGEM gifted me with both the chances to broaden my knowledge in Biology and build invaluable bonds with some of the greatest people I have met in my life. Surely, participating in IGEM has marked a whole new chapter in my life as a college student.

                       I’ve been mainly working on public engagement and outreach. I think these are very meaningful activity that let the public to know about synthetic biology, because I was one of the people who don’t even heard of synthetic biology. As one of the member of iGEM team, Korea_U_Seoul, it is great experience for me to open the new world-synthetic biology- and meet good members of our team.

                       Hi! My name is San Hae Im, who will be the most famous nano bio scientist in the world. Before introduce myself, I am very thank to our team members to work during 1 year. I’m graduate HSHS(Hansung Science High School). My major is life sciences in Korea University in Seoul, and fusion major is KU-KIST. I will be graduate student next year, and I think I will work in graduate school of nano science and technology in KAIST. I loved science experiment from when I was elementary school. So, I was mainly belong to lab team, but I worked with modelling team, design team and HP team. This is my first time to participate in iGEM 2016, and I wish to held a fantastic iGEM. I want to meet everyone in the conference. Then, see you later!

                       As a science communicator, my primary interest lies in the popularization of science. My major role in the team is to deal with public engagements and associated partnerships. Experiences in hosting public lectures, managing translation works and holding mentoring sessions helped me broaden my understanding on how science and society works. I hope the upcoming giant jamboree would also be the great experience for all!
