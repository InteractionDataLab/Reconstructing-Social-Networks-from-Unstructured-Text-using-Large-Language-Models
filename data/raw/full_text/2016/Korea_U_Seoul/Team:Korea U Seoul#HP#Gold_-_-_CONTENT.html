I was interested in ethics. It was very satisfying because I could discuss lots of topics and share thoughts.
</P><P> 
I understand that DIY bio is very good, but we need regulations about Bio crackers as well as Bio hackers first.
</P><P>
Through seminar, I could think about the two topics about biological ethics. It refeshed my thoughts I had when I do experiments in school, and I could get more acquaintances which scientists and teachers need to know.
 </P><P>
I have heard about Synthetic biology before, but through this semina I could fully understand this study. Also, discsussions were so instructive for me. It was such a good experience. Thanks.
 </P><P>
Good job.

I was sorry that discussion session was so short.
