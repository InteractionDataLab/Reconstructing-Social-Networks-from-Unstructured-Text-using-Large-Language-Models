Bronze
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry : BBa_K2094002
Silver
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. : BBa_K2094001
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way. : Link
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM.
Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. : Link
Gold
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. : Link
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept. : Link
Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab. : Link
