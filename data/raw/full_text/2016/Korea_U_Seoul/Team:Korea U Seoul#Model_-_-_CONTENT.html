As mentioned in the US Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues (PCSBI)’s report, modelling is a powerful tool for scientists to predict the behavior of a biological system before it is actually built. [1] Our team designed a simulation model of Enzymatic Microbial Fuel Cell (EMFC) using MATLAB SIMULINK software by integrating series of Michaelis-Menten kinetics and Butler-Volmer equation. Using the model, we will find out the electric characteristic of the developed fuel cell.</FONT></P><P>
Result of our team’s EMFC modelling is not just limited to this year’s IGEM competition. By changing the variable used in our modelling, SIMULINK block developed by our team can be applied to any EFC, MFC, or EMFC modelling by simply changing the variables in model. Not only for our team’s experiment, this model will function as a valuable tool for other synthetic biologist’s research and engineering purposes. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="section" id="identification"><DIV class="slim"><H2>2.

 Fermentation of galactose involves 5 key enzymes, galM (galactose mutarotase), galK (galactokinase), galT (galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase), pgm (phosphoglucomutase), and pyruvate-formate lyase. Using BRENDA enzyme database, Specific Activity (SA)/Km was calculated to represent the enzyme’s relative rate of metabolism. We assumed that the enzyme with higher the SA/Km value proceed in faster reaction. SA/Km of each enzyme is represented below, which shows that galactose kinase (galK) is the RDS enzyme of galactose fermentation.

Discussion</H2><P><FONT size="4">Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool for biologists to predict how the designed system will work during the experiment. Our team designed a model to predict how the current density production of EMFC is varied along with changing substrate concentration over time. Current production was stabilized approximately 200 seconds after activation at 0.125mM of initial agarose concentration. The change in current production of EMFC was consistent with the experiment, showing stabilization after certain amount of time. Also, stabilized value of current density was 0.06 A/m^2, which was highly similar to the stabilized current density in actual EMFC which was around 0.05 A/m^2. However, model’s time until stabilization was extremely fast compared to actual time to stabilization in experiment, t ≒ 5 hour.</FONT></P><P><FONT size="4">
 The difference between modelling output and experimental result might be originated from oversimplification of the model. We simplified the reactions of EMFC into 5 reactions. Uncounted enzymes and reactions can directly affect the rate of metabolism and by specifying the reaction into various steps and applying the kinetics of each reaction, gap between the model and actual EMFC data will be reduced. Also, formate from galactose fermentation in <EM>E. coli</EM> relies secretion through <EM>E.coli</EM>’s membrane and transport across MR-1’s membrane. This causes delayed foodstuff transfer between two organisms and therefore causes delay in stabilized current production. Time for formate fermentation wasn’t considered in model also, which will increase the stabilization time. Model reflecting the exact formate transfer will give much more accurate result.  </FONT></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="section" id="introduction_B"><DIV id="references"><H2>References</H2><OL class="references"><LI>Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues (2010)
