Team:Kingsborough NY/Engagement
Throughout the entire length of our project -- from internal formulation to external production -- team members have discussed the overview and details of the project with several demographics: women, men, children, young adults, elderly adults, students, the employed, and the unemployed. We’ve approached strangers and close relations to inform them of the potential benefits and hazards of biosynthetic products. We’ve sought to engage, educate, and entertain people directly on a personal level through one-on-one dialogue and in large groups through presentations. We’ve also reached out to broader audiences online through social media. After the conclusion of our iGEM project, we will continue to enlighten the people we meet.
Our team also presented in a lecture hall of Kingsborough Community College to educate the students there about our project. We have them do a survey to gather their honest opinion towards synthetic biology, GMO, and E.coli.
