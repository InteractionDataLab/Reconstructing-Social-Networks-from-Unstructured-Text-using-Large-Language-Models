The main goal of this project is to design E.coli to metabolize ammonia and create a hydrazine byproduct. This would decrease the time and cost of metabolizing ammonia in waste treatment plants versus using traditional K. stuttgartiensis since E.coli is significantly easier to culture. Next steps include removing hydrazine though the ways about doing this has not been explored yet. One possible solution is to add other metabolic components that already exist in the K. stuttgartiensis to oxidize hydrazine to nitrogen gas such as Hydrazine dehydrogenase. Hydroxyl Amine Oxidation (HOX) will also be added to examine the theory that Hydrazine Synthase needs a partner enzyme (HOX) to function optimally. However, one possible direction this project can go is to mass produce hydrazine for industrial use. Hydrazine is used to in many pharmaceuticals and in organic chemistry synthesis therefore using our engineered E.coli may be useful in mass producing hydrazine. Hydrazine is also used as rocket propellant therefore our engineered bacteria can produce decrease the cost of making hydrazine.
