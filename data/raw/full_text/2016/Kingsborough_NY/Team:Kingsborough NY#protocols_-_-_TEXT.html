We had three genes shipped to us after looking through a database and identifying the three genes associated with making hydrazine synthetase. The genes were KUST-2859, KUST-2860, and KUST-2861. We used PCR to increases the concentration of our desired genes for experimental use. We used a gel electrophoresis to check whether the PCR reaction had worked.  Using endonucleases, we cut known plasmid using EcoRI, PstI, and XbaI. Then did three separate ligation reaction with KUST-2859, KUST-2860, and KUST-2861. We then did a DNA a purification using a mini-prep kit from a company and ran a gel electrophoresis to see if our ligation had occurred. If ligation had occurred, we then transformed 5-Alpha E.coli and tested for successful transformation by looking at a change in color from blue to white. However, we had issues with PCR in our shipped genes. All our genes showed mixed results in a gel electrophoresis indicating our PCR did not work or very little of the desired gene was amplified. KUST-2861 was also a very large gene therefore the gene was sent to us cleaved at an overlapping site. Because of this, in a traditional PCR reaction the reaction must first extend the cleaved overlapping regions then ligating gaps before amplifying the gene which increases the chance for error. Furthermore, transformation of E.coli showed initial successful transformation but upon further inspection of E.coli cells using a gel electrophoresis our desired insert was not shown. Problem solving solutions included varying the temperature of the PCR reaction which KUST-2859 showed results on a gel electrophoresis at 58 degrees Celsius. Adding DMSO increased yield of PCR reactions. We then used the Gibson assembly for all three genes which was more successful in showing our inserts on the gel electrophoresis. The Gibson assembly is a novel technique that is flexible because of the lack of primer and applicable to different ends of DNA. Refer to Gibson Assembly protocol for detailed explanation.
Standard PCR Protocol (for 25 µl reaction (x2 for 50 µl reaction) 10x Standard Taq reaction buffer: 2.5 µl 10 mM dNTPs: 0.5 µl 10 µM forward primer: 0.5 µl 10 µM reverse primer: 0.5 µl Template DNA Taq DNA polymerase: 0.125 µl Distilled Water: fill up to 25 µl Denaturation occurs at 95o Celsius and extension temperature at 450 to 68o Celsius. Holding temperature at 40 to 100 Celsius. Add DMSO to prevent DNA re-folding or high GC regions.
QIAprep Spin MiniPrep Kit and Centrifuge Re-suspend pellet bacterial cells in 250 µl Buffer P1 and transfer to micro centrifuge tube. If LyseBlue is added, vigorously shake the buffer to ensure LyseBlue particles are dissolved. LyseBlue is used to break down bacteria cell wall.  Add 250 µl Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting 4-6 times. Add 350 µl Buffer N3 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times. Centrifuge for ten minutes at 13,000 RPM in a centrifuge. (Note: Balancing tubes is essential to prevent machine breaking) Transfer 800 µl of the supernatant to the QIAprep 2.0 spin column by pipetting. Centrifuge 30-60 seconds. Discard the flow through. Wash the QIAprep 2.0 spin column by adding 0.5 µl Buffer PB and centrifuging for 30-60s. Discard flow through. Wash QIAprep 2.0 spin column by adding 0.75 ml buffer PE and centrifuging for 30-60s. Discard flow through and centrifuge for another one minute to remove residual wash buffer. Elute DNA into a clean 1.5 ml centrifuge tube using 50 µl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5) or use water. Let stand for one minute and centrifuge for one minute.
Gibson Assembly Method The Gibson Method consist of having overlapping DNAs being cut at the 5’ end using exonuclease. Overlapping ends serve as primers for DNA polymerase. DNA ligase seals nicks or gaps. Q5 Master Mix was provided by New England BioLab Incorporated which contained desired DNA sequences, exonucleases, DNA polymerases and ligases. Alkaline Lysis Plasmid Mini-Prep Protocol
Harvesting:
1. Transfer a single bacterial colony into 2 ml of LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotic in a loosely capped 15 ml tube.  Incubate the culture overnight at 37 °C with vigorous shaking.  2. Pour 1.5 ml of the culture into a microfuge tube.  Centrifuge for 30 s at 12,000g in a microfuge.  Store the remainder of the culture at 4°C.  3. Remove the medium, leaving the bacterial pellet as dry as possible.  Lysis by Alkali:  1. Resuspend the bacterial pellet (obtained in step 3 above) in 100 µl of ice-cold Solution I by vigorous vortexing.  2. Add 200 µl of freshly prepared Solution II.  Close the tube tightly, and mix the contents by inverting the tube rapidly.  Make sure that the entire surface of the tube comes in contact with Solution II.  Do not vortex.  Store the tube on ice.  3. Add 150 µl of ice-cold Solution III.  Close the tube and vortex it gently in an inverted position for 10 s to disperse Solution III through the viscous bacterial lysate.  Store the tube on ice for 3-5 min.  4. Centrifuge at 12.000 g for 5 minutes in a microfuge.  Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube.  5. Add 450 µl of phenol : chloroform.  Mix by vortexing.  After centrifuging at 12.000 g for 2 minutes in a microfuge, transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh tube.  6. Add 450 µl of chloroform.  Mix by vortexing.  After centrifuging at 12.000 g for 2 minutes in a microfuge, transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh tube.  7. Precipitate the double-stranded DNA with 2 volumes of ethanol at room temperature.  Mix by vortexing.  Allow the mixture to stand for 5 minutes at 4 °C.   8. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 5 minutes at 4 °C in a microfuge.  9. Remove the supernatant. 10. Rinse the pellet of double-stranded DNA with 1 ml of 70% ethanol.  Remove the supernatant, and allow the pellet of nucleic acid to dry in the air for 10 min.  11. Resuspend the nucleic acids in 50 µl of TE (pH 8.0) containing DNAse-free pancreatic RNAse (20 µg/ml).  Vortex briefly.  Store the DNA at 4 °C.
