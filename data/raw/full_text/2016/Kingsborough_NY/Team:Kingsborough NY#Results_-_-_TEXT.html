BioBricks Submitted
We submitted several BioBricks representing different subunits of Hydrazine Synthase (HZS):
K1952000 : HZS gamma
K1952001 : HZS beta
K1952002 : HZS alpha
K1952004 : HZS beta with RBS
K1952007 : HZS beta with promoter and RBS
K1952009 : HZS gamma, beta, alpha subunit operon
K1952010 : HZS beta fused to LacZ alpha
Expression Data
One of our cultures turned blue in the presence of X-gal and IPTG, indicating expression of the fused HZS-gamma::lacZ-alpha reporter gene. Yay!
