Medium and solutions
Hutner’s Trace Elements
For 1 liter final mix, dissolve each compound in the volume of water indicated. The EDTA should be dissolved in boiling water, and the FeSO4 should be prepared last to avoid oxidation.
Material
50 g EDTA disodium salt dissolved in 250 ml water
22 g ZnSO4 ∙ 7 H2O dissolved in 100 ml water
11.4 g H3BO3 dissolved in 200 ml water
5.06 g MnCl2 ∙ 4 H2O dissolved in 50 ml water
1.61 g CoCl2 ∙ 6 H2O dissolved in 50 ml water
1.57 g CuSO4 ∙ 5 H2O dissolved in 50 ml water
1.10 g (NH4)6Mo7O24 ∙ 4 H2O dissolved in 50 ml water
4.99 g FeSO4 ∙ 7 H2O dissolved in 50 ml water
Procedure
Mix all solutions except EDTA. Bring the solution to boil and then add EDTA solution. The mixture should turn green.
When everything is dissolved, cool to 70 °C.
Keep the temperature at 70 °C, add 85 ml hot 20% KOH solution (20 grams / 100 ml final volume).
Bring the final solution to 1 liter total volume. It should be clear green initially.
Stopper the flask with a cotton plug and let it stand for 1-2 weeks, shaking it once a day. Note: If no precipitate forms, the solution is still usable. However, you might want to check the pH in this case and adjust it to around 7.0 using either KOH or HCl as needed, do NOT use NaOH to adjust the pH. .
The solution should eventually turn purple and leave a rust-brown precipitate, which can be removed by filtering through two layers of Whatman#1 filter paper, repeating the filtration if necessary until the solution is clear.
Store refrigerated or frozen convenient aliquots (1).

Plasmid preparation
Procedure
Pellet 1–5 ml of an overnight recombinant E. coli culture by centrifugation. Transfer the appropriate volume of the recombinant E. coli culture to a microcentrifuge tube and pellet cells at ≥12,000 3 g for 1 minute. Discard the supernatant.
Resuspend cells: Completely resuspend the bacterial pellet with 200 µl of the Resuspension Solution. Vortex or pipette up and down to thoroughly resuspend the cells until homogeneous.
Lyse cells: Lyse the resuspended cells by adding 200 µl of the Lysis Solution. Immediately mix the contents by gentle inversion (6–8 times) until the mixture becomes clear and viscous. Do not vortex. Harsh mixing will shear genomic DNA, resulting in chromosomal DNA contamination in the final recovered plasmid DNA. Do not allow the lysis reaction to exceed 5 minutes.
Neutralize: Precipitate the cell debris by adding 350 µl of the Neutralization/Binding Solution. Gently invert the tube 4–6 times. Pellet the cell debris by centrifuging at ≥12,000 x g or maximum speed for 10 minutes. If the supernatant contains a large amount of floating particulates after centrifugation, recentrifuge the supernatant before proceeding to step 6.
Prepare Column: Insert a GenElute Miniprep Binding Column into a provided microcentrifuge tube, if not already assembled. Add 500 µl of the Column Preparation Solution to each miniprep column and centrifuge at ≥12,000 x g for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Discard the flow-through liquid.
Load cleared lysate: Transfer the cleared lysate from step 3 to the column prepared in step 4 and centrifuge at ≥12,000 x g for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Discard the flow-through liquid.
Wash column: Add 750 µl of the diluted Wash Solution to the column. Centrifuge at ≥12,000 x g for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Discard the flow-through liquid and centrifuge again at maximum speed for 1 to 2 minutes without any additional Wash Solution.
Elute DNA: Transfer the column to a fresh collection tube. Add 50 µl water to the column. Centrifuge at ≥12,000 x g for 1 minute. The DNA is now present in the eluate and is ready for immediate use or storage at –20 °C (13).
Transformation
Material
E.coli XL1-blue supercompetent cells 20 μl
DNA     1 μl (5 ng)
Soc medium    100 μl
LB-agarplates with Chloramphenicol (CHL) resistence
Procedure
Thaw the E.coli XL1-blue supercompetent cells on ice
Portion in 20 μl and add approximately 1 μl (5 ng) DNA
Mix gently with pipette tip and incubate on ice for 30 minutes
Heat shock cells in heating block 45 seconds at 42℃, then place on ice for 2 minutes
Add 100 μl preheated (42℃) Soc medium and incubate the transformation mixture for 2 h at 37℃
Spread all of the transformation mixture (121 μl) on preheated agarplates (37℃) with Chloramphenicol resistance
Incubated over night (at least 16 hours). Count the number of colonies
Store in cold room, approximately 4℃ (14)
Note: Control plate is done without DNA in order to control the antibiotic resistance works.
Transformation of Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii by electroporation
All steps, except the growing of Chlamydomonas, will be proceeded at room temperature.
Electroporator: Bio Rad Micropulser
Cuvettes: 4 mm gap
OD750nm: 0.3 – 0.5
Applied pulses: 3
Sample volume: 250 μl
Voltage: 0.80 kV
Procedure
Day -x:
Start 6 ml Chlamydomonas r. culture in TAP media
Grow under light and agitation of 120 rpm until OD750nm: ≈ 0.6
Day 0:
Measure OD750nm
Dilute culture to OD750nm: 0.09 using TAP media (45 ml is needed for the next day)
Grow under light and agitation for 22-24 h (OD750nm should reach 0.3-0.5)
Day 1:
Measure OD750nm and note it above
Centrifuge 45 ml culture at 2000 x g for 10 min in 50 ml conical tubes
Discard supernatant completely
Dissolve pellet gently in 750 μl TAP -40mM sucrose media
Transfer aliquot of 250 μl into 4 mm cuvette
Add 2 ug of linearized vector
Incubate for 2-4 min
Pulse 3 times at 0.80 kV
Add aliquots of 125 μl into 5 ml TAP-40 mM sucrose media (6 well)
Rinse cuvettes with media from the plates
Grow under light and agitation for max. 24 h
Day 2:
Centrifuge 10 ml culture at 2000 x g for 10 min in 25 ml conical tubes
Resuspend cells in 300 μl TAP-40 mM sucrose media
Split in half and add each 150 μl culture to 5 ml TAP with 10 ug/ μl Hygromycin
Grow for 5-8 days until culture turns green
Plate 50 μl on 1 % TAP agar plates, seal with Parafilm and grow under light until colonies are clearly visible
Otherwise add 50 μl culture to fluid TAP media with increasing Hygromycin concentrations to screen for high expressing lines due to positional effects.
Note: Too much salts will decrease the electrical resistance of the sample. This can lead to a decrease of the applied voltage during the Electroporation. The Biorad Micropulser is able to show the actual applied Voltage. Digest at least 2 ug Plasmid-DNA per reaction. After inactivation of RE the digest can directly be used for the transformation. After the electroporation be very gently with the cells (esp. pipetting). When plating on agar plates use plating spatulas and try to spread the cultures on the middle of plate for best results. Otherwise most colonies will grow at the edge of the plates (15-17).
