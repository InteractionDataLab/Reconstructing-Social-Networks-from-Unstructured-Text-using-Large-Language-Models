Welcome to LiU iGEM 2016!
About LiU iGEM
LiU iGEM was founded in 2013 at Linköping University and has been active with different projects ever since. This year we are a group of 11 students participating, studying everything from computer science to biology.  The project this year aims to optimize algae for biofuel production. Since today's use of fossil fuels is highly extensive we want to make it easier to enable economically efficient biofuels. Algae have shown great potential as a source for biofuels, unfortunately  their lipid content is too low, making the fuel expensive. Therefore, we attempt to increase the lipid content using the latest genetic tool CRISPR/Cas9 and a light induced system in the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
