                    Gibson assembly is an exonuclease-based method to assembly multiple DNA fragments in correct order. The method was invented in 2009 by Daniel G. Gibson, of the J. Craig Venter Institute. The assembly reaction is carried out in one single reaction-tube, all at once, at 50° Celsius for 15-60 minutes. The process involves three different enzymatic actions. A 5’ exonuclease creates overhangs, enabling matched fragments to anneal. Then a DNA polymerase fills gap between the annealed strands and the 5´ end. Finally, a DNA ligase seals the gaps between the filled in gap and the annealed strands.
                    
                    For more information, see <A href="/Team:Linkoping_Sweden/Description/Gibson_assembly">Gibson Assembly</A>
                    Using this method, we constructed three different parts, see <A href="/Team:Linkoping_Sweden/Results">results</A>.

                    The major part of our team attended to the study visit at Ångströmhuset, where
                    the university have their electron microscope. The building is named after the
                    Swedish physicist Anders Ångström and is located a short distance from the
                    centre of the university. The location as well as the placement on solid ground
                    is to minimize disruption of the measurements. We learned a lot about the
                    function and the applications of electron microscopy, but also how difficult it
                    can be to receive trust-worthy data from measurements we use daily.
