i Publishing of group members
After a few information meetings held by the principle investigators and the                     instructors the 2016’ LiU iGEM Team was set.
Team registration
i Lecture about arsenic poisoning
To find inspiration for our project we had a lecture in arsenic poisoning and                     protein aggregation with one of the principal investigators of our project. We                     all were very excited about the topic of the lecture but we decided that it                     would be difficult to make a iGEM project about it.
April
i Lecture about algae
Further on we had a lecture about algae and why the biodiesel production from                     algae is not economically sustainable with the Assistant Professor Johan                     Edquist. It did not take long until we all were agreed that we wanted to work                     with algae in the 2016’ iGEM project.
i Project design
To make more biomass out of algae we investigated different methods and                     promoters, but in an early state is was clear that we wanted to work with                     CRISPR/Cas9 and a light inducible promoter called SORLIP.
i Project plan development
When we had a project design we planned the time we had before the Giant                     Jamboree, this to be able to make the best we could of the time we had. The                     project plan was a draft of this timeline.

Applying for sponsorship by Genscript
i Sequence construction
At this state we did research about how to construct the including parts as well                     as the BioBricks in total. Also, we started off with design of primers to                     different parts.

Finally, our final DNA Construct design was finished. See Project design for                     more information.
Laboratory saftey lecture
i Nordic iGEM conference
The Nordic iGEM Conference, NiC, is a weekend long mini Jamboree held by one of                     the Nordic iGEM Teams. This event is hosted by the team who held the best                     presentation the previous year according to the NiC jury. The 2016’s conference                     was arranged by Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. This was a perfect opportunity                     to get to know the Nordic iGEM Teams and to practice our presentation for the                     Giant Jamboree. Also, the event offered Workshops, BBQs with biotech students                     from five different countries amongst other activities.

i First day at the laboratory
In the waiting for ordered primers, vector and such, we prepared TAP and LB                     medium, agar plates etc.
i LiU iGEM Team Kick-off
When the group members were chosen and the project design was finished we                     started the summer with a kick-off at Robert Forchheimer, the founder of LiU                     iGEM. We had a lovely meal outside and some of us took a swim in the swimming                     pool. We listened to music, played games and had a fantastic evening.
i Made the cover of the local newspaper "Östgöta Correspondenten"
We made the cover of the local newspaper, Östgöta correspondenten called Corren.                     This Newspaper is delivered to households each morning within the providence                     Östergötland. The article was mainly about the concept of iGEM and the project                     of the year. The focus laid at making more biomass out of C. reinhardtii and the                     contributing work to minimize the greenhouse effect.
i New project approach
Publishing of interviews with interesting personalities on FB
With the laboratory deadline getting closer, we were still out of luck when it                     came to results. We decided that it was time to make a change regarding how we                     executed our project to reach our goals. The project idea remained the same, but                     the approach changed. Instead of using the traditional digest-ligation method to                     construct the parts, we went ahead with a different method called Gibson Assembly. This Assembly enables the creation of a construction of up to six                     parts in just one reaction. Our hope was restored!
i All firms at the list of potantial sponsor of the project this year must be contacted
We started off early with finding potential sponsors and listed them on an                     internal document. Further on we contacted them one by one at the same time we                     investigated firms to build on our list with. At this deadline we had to been in                     contact with all of the firms at our list to be able to focus fully on our lab                     activities. Our search for sponsors continued though.
July
i First transformation and Chlamydomonas reinhartii cultivation
Publishing of Donor Website
We used the iGEM Competent Cell Test Kit in order to control the transformation                     efficacy of our heat competent cells (E. Coli Xl1-blue). Our goal was to                     introduce the DNA                     construct into the algae C. reinhardtii, which is why the first                     cultivation was started early. We wanted to optimize the cultivation conditions                     for the algae.
i Birth of Miss Mona
After inactivation of the gene coding for starch in a baby Mona our team mascot                     evolved into Miss Mona. This young single-celled lady alga is a specie called C. reinhardtii, the algae we use in our project experiments. Her mainly diet is                     Swedish bulk confectionary and she is currently single. Miss Mona was created both                     as a tradition for the Liu iGEM team, as well as a part of the Human Practice.                     She has been attending to all exhibitions and presentations of the year.
i First PCR and gel electrophoresis
The first PCR-reaction was made and we amplified one of the desired sequences to our construct ,                     the Cas9 sequence, from an existing BioBrick. Verification of the product was                     made according to fragment size through gel electrophoresis.

i NärCon convention
NärCon is a Play and CosPlay Festival where the team worked as representatives                     for Linköping University in order to inform about the university as well as iGEM                     and our project. This CosPlay convention attracted over 8500 visitors and lasted                     for four days, LiU iGEM was of course active during all that time!
August
i First Chlamydomonas reinhartii cultivation in darkness
As the DNA construct was designed with the light inducible promotor, a test culture in darkness was grown in order to study the optimal parameters such as temperature, TAP medium etc. in these conditions.

i First draft: team wiki and final report
i Was on the SVT News
It is important to start off with things early. Our iGEM project is possible to                     have as a course within synthetic biology, if you have the qualifications                     needed. As a final exam for this course we all write a scientific report about                     our project of the year. At this state we had both a first draft for the final                     report but also our Team Wiki.
Sweden's Television, SVT, is the national public TV broadcaster of                     Sweden. They made a reportage about our project in particular, but we also                     informed about iGEM in general.
i First Gibson assembly
We made the first attempt to assemble our final DNA construct with the method Gibson Assembly, which was totally new for us.
Gibson assembly is an exonuclease-based method to assembly multiple DNA fragments in correct order. The method was invented in 2009 by Daniel G. Gibson, of the J. Craig Venter Institute. The assembly reaction is carried out in one single reaction-tube, all at once, at 50° Celsius for 15-60 minutes. The process involves three different enzymatic actions. A 5’ exonuclease creates overhangs, enabling matched fragments to anneal. Then a DNA polymerase fills gap between the annealed strands and the 5´ end. Finally, a DNA ligase seals the gaps between the filled in gap and the annealed strands.
For more information, see Gibson Assembly
Using this method, we constructed three different parts, see results .

i First electroporation
Project presentation for the LiU Authorities
After the second Gibson Assembly we succeeded to bring together a variant of our                     final DNA construct. This allowed us to try out the electroporation of this                     fragment into the algae C. reinhardtii. Confocal microscopy was used to                     detect fragment-positive colonies for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), while                     the YFP was inserted to the final DNA construct instead of the Hygromycin B                     cassette.

i Kalas (Exhibition fornew students at Linköping University)
Kalas is a great fair that mainly refers to the new students from all programs                     at Linkoping´s University. With 8000 students visiting, Kalas is the largest                     event for new students in Sweden. We were on site to reach out to all students                     about our project and arouse an interest for iGEM and our student organization                     as well as synthetic biology. It was an excellent opportunity to recruit                     interest from a wide set of skills for future project and engagement. LiU iGEM                     had our own table and was giving handouts to the visitors and exchanged some                     words about iGEM.

i Holding presentation about igem and the project of the year for a course in gene techology at LiU
We held a presentation for a course in gene technology at the University. The                     presentation was a preview of the presentation that we are about to have on the                     Giant Jamboree. We also promoted iGEM and the yearly LiU iGEM project, many                     found a great interest in taking part in this synthetic biology project and                     signed up for a future membership.

i Study visit at Ångströmhuset
The major part of our team attended to the study visit at Ångströmhuset, where                     the university have their electron microscope. The building is named after the                     Swedish physicist Anders Ångström and is located a short distance from the                     centre of the university. The location as well as the placement on solid ground                     is to minimize disruption of the measurements. We learned a lot about the                     function and the applications of electron microscopy, but also how difficult it                     can be to receive trust-worthy data from measurements we use daily.
