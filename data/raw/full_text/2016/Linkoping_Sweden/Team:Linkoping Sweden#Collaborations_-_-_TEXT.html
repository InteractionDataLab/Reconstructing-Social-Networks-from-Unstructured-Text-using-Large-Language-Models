Collaborations
Cambridge JIC-team, England
The Cambridge JIC-team were generating a chloroplast transformation toolkit and were interested in expressing a CRISPR/Cas9-system in chloroplasts of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The purpose of the project was to achieve homoplasmy quicker, in a matter of days rather than months since no selective plating would be required.
The collaboration between LiU iGEM and Cambridge JIC-team has been an ongoing process in the form of e-mail contact, skype meetings and weekly reports about the week that was. The exchange has included discussions, questions about the model organism, Gibson assembly and other approaches, different protocols and other things that felt unclear.
USP/UNIFESP, Brazil
The Brazil team USP/UNIFESP also work with C. reinhardtii and wanted to try CRISPR/Cas9 with RNPs but encountered some difficulties when it turned out that another team worked on a similar project. The team needed a new approach which we helped them with. This was done by exchanging protocols and regular updates from both teams.
Collaborations via surveys
Surveys are an easy way to reach the public, LiU iGEM both answered and shared surveys from other teams in order to help them in their work.
Collaborations via surveys were with following teams: - Team Aachen , Germany
- Team Chalmers , Sweden
- Team XMU , China
- Team Groningen , Netherlands
- Team Göttingen , Germany
- Team TU-Münich and LMU , Germany
