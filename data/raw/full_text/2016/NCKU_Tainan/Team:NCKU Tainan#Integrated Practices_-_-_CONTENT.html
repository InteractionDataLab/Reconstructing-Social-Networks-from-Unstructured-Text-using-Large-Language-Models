We, iGEM NCKU, are the first university from the southern Taiwan to attend iGEM  Competition organized by MIT, Boston. By involving in Synthetic Biology and iGEM Competition, our team is confident to make a breakthrough in this field via multidisciplinary cooperation and can proudly present our work on the international platform.  In turn, this Asia-Pacific Conference was the first step for us to introduce the idea to other teams from different countries in Asia. </P><P>We invited 20 teams from different schools in five countries to this Meet-up Conference. Professional scholars and entrepreneurs were also invited to provide us academic knowledge and suggestions. The approaches for meeting people and expanding ideas in this conference are presentations, poster exhibitions, team experience sharing, Round table, and Tainan cultural tours. After this Asia-Pacific Academic Exchange Conference, we believe that we make others understand our intension and indeed makes NCKU a step closer to spreading the idea universally.</P><H5>Team's Project</H5><P style="width:60%;display:inline-block;">Several presentations were made by the professors and representatives of our sponsor. Besides, our team presentation which was about our device was also performed to gain valuable feedback from the audience. This 20-minute English presentation, including the present and future research, objective, device and Q&amp;A session. </P><H5>Poster</H5><P>There was a poster presentation from every team to enable every team sharing their research works and findings.</P><DIV class="title-content">Experience Sharing Workshop -- [Random Group Formation]</DIV><P>One very exciting part in Asia-Pacific Conference is a variety of workshops to share attendees’ thinking. Within the workshop, attendees were randomly grouped. One member from iGEM NCKU_Tainan led the group discussion to elicit their iGEM experience along the iGEM journey. In those sharings and discussions, we could view the problems from other districts, culture and society.</P><P>Light up:  We can share positive stories, experiences, uniqueness, management tips, etc so that other teams can refer to.</P><P>Dark side: We also share failures and downfalls in order to help us learn from mistakes. We realized that everything will be all right in the end. If it’s not all right then it’s not the end.  So finding out the solution to work it out is the best way. </P><DIV class="title-content">Round Table--[Policy] or [Public Perception]</DIV><P>The Round Table was hosted by professors or representatives of entrepreneurs to guide the participants to think out of the box. One of very crucial goals in this program is to share and raise people’s critical awareness. The experts offered the valuable knowledge and suggestions. to back up the awareness development. </P><DIV class="title-line" id="ques">Questionnaire</DIV><P>Except the suggestion form other iGEMers and professionals, we also hope to hear more from ordinary people. Our team knows the ultimate goal of human practice is to give rise to the awareness of diabetes. By doing the questionnaire, we understood the common mistakes about diabetes or the challenges for diabetes management.</P><DIV class="title-line" id="video">Educational Video</DIV><VIDEO class="demo-video" controls=""><SOURCE src="/wiki/images/c/c4/T--NCKU_Tainan--eduVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
