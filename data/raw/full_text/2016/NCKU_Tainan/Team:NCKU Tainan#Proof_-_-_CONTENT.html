The upper control limit is considered as the threshold of “positive”. When the fluorescent intensity in a urine sample surpasses the upper control limit, we can refer to the urine sample as diabetic urine.

To verify the function, by applying the upper limit of the 95% prediction interval of glucose negative urine sample〈red〉as the “diabetic threshold“, we performed a test to clarify whether our U.coli can differentiate diabetes from control. At time T= 101mis with n= 84,  our result shows sensitivity= 95% and if we delay the testing time to T=120mins, the sensitivity will be 100%.〈n=84〉, which proved that our U.coli do Differentiate diabetic urine with norma</P><P>To further elaborate our proof of concept, we have a <A href="/Team:NCKU_Tainan/Model_Statistics_Analysis">statistical calculation</A></P><H5>Proof of Concept: Prediction and Quantifying the amount of urine glucose</H5><P>After successfully differentiating diabetic urine sample with control, we aim to measure the amount of glucose in urine sample. Thus, we used final glucose concentration of: 0,1,3,5,15,30,45 mM/L to induce our U.coli for 12 hours in 96 well and measure the fluorescent intensity at excitation/emission wavelength 562nm/599nm, the difference of fluorescent intensity between each group were significant at T (time) = 8hr.

Compared to control, arabinose significantly inhibited the growth of U.coli after time T&gt;50 mins. In addition, when glucose and arabinose are both present, glucose will repress the growth inhibitory effect of arabinose, making the cells continue to growth. Still, compared to control, the growth rate is slightly decreased by arabinose, even with the presence of glucose.</P><P>To further validate the effect of our Safety circuit, we performed a CFU assay.
