Safety Issues
How did we address the safety issues in our project?
Non-pathogenic chassis, i.e. E. coli DH5α, E. coli (DE3), were chosen.
The chassis is in small enclosed space as a barrier to prevent contamination.
"Suicide-gene inducers" in the enclosed space can induce expression of the suicide gene to kill E. coli in the bio-sensing strip.
Safety Plan
Our E. coli can sense urea glucose. When the glucose level is high, the bacteria can express red fluorescent proteins (RFP) as a reporter to give a signal which can be detected at the state of excitation. After the detection, the “suicide-gene inducers”, arabinose, induce the PBAD promoter ( BBa_K206000 ) and then activate the transcription of the lysis gene ( BBa_K117000 ). The functional assays are showed in Bio-Safety System (Project/ Results) .
Safe Lab
Building a safe lab
We operated the project in the Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) Lab. The space is suitable for experiments in all of our chassis which are Risk Group 1 organisms. Additionally, we always handled biological materials in a laminar flow hood. All of biowastes were autoclaved at the typical 121 °C/15 psi for 15 minutes.
Obeying the laws and regulations of biosafety in our Country/ University
Regarding the Environmental Protection, Safety and Health Center is responsible for the safety of biology labs at National Cheng Kung University ( Guidelines for Laboratory Biosafety ). And Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is the department to govern biosafety for research laboratories in our country ( Laboratory Biosafety Management: A Compilation of Regulations and Administrative Guidance ).
