Protocols & Materials
To collaborate with TCU_Taiwan , we shared the protocol and sent the material for 1000ml of Glucose-free modified M9 medium for cell culturing and functional experiments.
Protocol for modified M9:
For preparing 10X M9 stock
Formulation
Disodium Phosphate Heptahydrate         128 g/L
Monopotassium Phosphate                30 g/L
Sodium Chloride                         5 g/L
Ammonium Chloride                     10 g/L
Final pH (2X solution): 6.6–7.0 at 25°C
After diluting to 1X and autoclave, for every 20 ml, add
20% D-Glucose solution       400ul
1.0 M MgSO4 solution         40ul
1.0 M CaCl2 solution         2ul
20% Casamino acid            200ul
Modified M9 Sample sent to TCU_Taiwan

Collaboration with TCU_Taiwan
Both of us are doing the project about glucose detection. We discuss some issues about how E. coli reacts when glucose is added and shares the information and difficulties.
Furthermore, we also provide some mathematical support to derive the formula of production rates when system reaches its equilibrium.
