In addition to discussing details of our projects with members of other iGEM teams including William &amp; Mary, Helsinki, and NYU Abu-Dhabi, we offered our support to four teams from around the world. </P><H4> University College of London</H4><P> We volunteered to test software developed by the University College of London’s iGEM team for designing gene circuits. We shared our experience using their software and suggested several changes to improve its versatility. </P><H4> Rice University </H4><P> We were also proud to help mentor a new iGEM team. Rice University’s iGEM team was interested in incorporating software into their project, but to do so they needed a stronger background in coding. Since our team has a history of integrating complex software with our projects, notably for this year’s project and last year’s, we asked our experienced members to lend their expertise. We were in contact with their team and gave advice on software.  </P><H4> University of Virginia </H4><P> Because the University of Virginia’s project was centered on the idea of biocontainment which is one of the applications that prompted our own project, we engaged with their team to look at current attitudes and policies toward biocontainment. Our team discussed a series of survey responses and provided the University of Virginia’ team with examples of applying biocontainment in systems that use parts from our two projects. </P><H4> University of Paris-Saclay </H4><P>Lastly, we gave feedback to Paris-Saclay’s iGEM team for their human practices work on Responsible Research and Innovation through a series of responses that we wrote about our own interpretation of those principles and their role in our project work.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
