Reproducibility of standardized biological parts
Given our overarching interest in the stability and reliability of genetic parts that is at the core of our project, we strongly supported iGEM’s initiative to conduct another Interlab Measurement Study.  We exactly followed the standardized protocol to measure three GFP expression constructions in absolute units. Our data closely matched published values for the characterization of each GFP construct, and we look forward to seeing how our dataset fits with those from other laboratories around the world.
Graphs of our data are included below, and will be included in an forthcoming publication in PLOS One.
