Welcome to the
2016 UIUC_Illinois iGEM Wiki
See Our Work
Promoters can be used to control the gene expression of whichever gene they are placed upstream of. Most promoters which are currently in the iGEM registry can be separated into one of two categories. There are constitutive, or “always on,” promoters of various strengths. There are also inducible promoters, which activate transcription based environmental factors such as light, pH, or the presence of any number of molecules.
For this year's competition, UIUC_Illinois is characterizing a promoter library that will give users more control over gene expression, without the need for inducers.
Just in Time.
A library of growth phase dependent promoters.
Project
See our team's project description and motivation for a promoter-driven project. Project design and safety considerations are also included.
Human Practices
iGEM teams strive to make an influence outside of wet lab work. This area includes exploring issues relating to the environment, community, ethics, and other humane topics of interest.
Wet Lab
See our team's work regarding the benchtop work done for the project. This includes our team's notebook, experiment, and results. See undergraduate lab research in action!
Interlab Study
View our team's interlab study considerations and data geared toward the future of iGEM.
