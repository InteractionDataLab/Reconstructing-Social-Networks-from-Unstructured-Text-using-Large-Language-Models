Brief Summary
BBa_K1987000
GFP with BsaI sites for promoter insertion
Measurement
This testing construct consists of a degradation-tagged GFP orf preceded by the lac promoter and RBS. The promoter and RBS are flanked by BsaI sites, allowing for different promoter+RBS combinations to be easily swapped into the construct. The strength and expression profile of the promoter/RBS combo can then be easily measured.
