Our basic parts form a collection of the following growth-phase dependent promoters:
Part number
Name
Type
Brief Summary
BBa_K1987030
On->off promoter
Regulatory
This promoter can be inserted upstream of any gene in order to provide timed gene expression. This promoter is active during the early growth phase of e. coli, but becomes less active later on, leading to an "on -> off" expression pattern.
BBa_K1987032
On->off promoter 2
Regulatory
This promoter can be inserted upstream of any gene in order to provide timed gene expression. This promoter is active during the early growth phase of e. coli, but becomes less active later on, leading to an "on -> off" expression pattern.
BBa_K1987038
Off -> on -> off promoter
Regulatory
This promoter can be inserted upstream of any gene in order to provide timed gene expression. This promoter is inactive during the early growth phase of e. coli, but becomes active in exponential phase before reducing activity in stationary phase, leading to an "off -> on -> off" expression pattern.
BBa_K1987042
off -> on (mid) promoter
Regulatory
This promoter can be inserted upstream of any gene in order to provide timed gene expression. This promoter is inactive during the early growth phase of e. coli, but becomes more active later on, leading to an "on -> off" expression pattern.
