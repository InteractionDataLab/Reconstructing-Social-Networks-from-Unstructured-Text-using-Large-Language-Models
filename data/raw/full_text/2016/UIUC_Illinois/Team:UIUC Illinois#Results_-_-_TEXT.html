Due to repeated difficulty with correctly assembling our GFP-based testing construct, we were unable to properly characterize our promoter library. It remains to be seen whether these isolated promoters can behave in the same way as was reported in the literature.
Future Plans
Despite the difficulties presented by cloning, we believe the concept of our promoter library shows great promise and will prove a useful tool once it has been characterized. Future directions include successfully inserting each of our promoters upstream of a degradation-tagged GFP cassette in order to accurately measure promoter activity over time. Once this has been accomplished, the promoters can be used for any number of applications, such as improving the temporal precision of protein production, gene circuits, or metabolic engineering.
