Overview
Overview
In the wetlab, we focused our efforts on two phases of our project. The first was isolating our putative promoters from e. coli MG1655 chromosomal DNA. The second was attempting to assemble these promoters into our GFP-based testing construct as a way to characterize their activity over time.
Our list of commonly used protocols can be found on the Experiments page.
For a detailed description of our work, see our team's notebooks.
