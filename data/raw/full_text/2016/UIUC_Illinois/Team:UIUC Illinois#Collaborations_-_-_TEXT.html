We reached out to Team Oxford to establish a collaboration that would help them achieve higher expression levels of their copper chelator Csp1sfGFP, and allow us to apply our promoters to the control of a non-trivial gene. Team Oxford also had easy access to a flow cytometer, which they would use to measure the cell to cell variance of our promoter devices. Unfortunately, we both faced unforeseen delays in the experimental assembly of our devices. Although we were in constant communication throughout the project, we were not able to pursue this plan completely.
