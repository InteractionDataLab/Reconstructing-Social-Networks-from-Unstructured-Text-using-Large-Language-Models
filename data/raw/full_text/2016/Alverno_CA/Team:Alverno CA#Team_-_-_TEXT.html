Alverno iGEM 2016
Our Team
Alverno Heights Academy (High School) iGEM 2016 team is made up of students who are passionate about science.  The all-girl team ranges in age from 14 - 18 yrs old. Whether they are members of Alverno's Accelerated Honors Academy for Gifted Girls, or HS Seniors ready to go to college, their enthusiasm and curiosity are contagious.
Alverno girls are no strangers to research, and have participated in Caltech's Solar Army SEAL Team, Summer SEAL Research at Caltech, and individual research projects.  With many awards in academics  and sports, they are a multi-talented group, who hail from Sierra Madre and neighboring cities, such as Pasadena,  Monrovia, San Gabriel, Altadena, Glendora, Rowland Heights, Temple City, and Arcadia.
