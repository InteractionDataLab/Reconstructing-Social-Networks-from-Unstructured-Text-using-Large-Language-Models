3. Pipette 6ul of 2-log ladder on side lanes (or given wells).
4. Pipette 1ul of purple loading dye on parafilm. Then pipette 5ul of DNA reaction and mix with loading dye on parafilm. (*For PCR Check: Directly pipette 2ul of purple loading dye into 10ul of PCR Check Reaction in microfuge tube)
5. Set to 6ul and pipette 6ul of mixed reaction with loading dye into selected wells according to drawn diagram.

Purification of Plasmid DNA
Ingredients/Materials *
• Liquid cultures
• Miniprep DNA kit (we used BioBasic kit)
Directions
1. Add 1.5 mL-5mL overnight culture in the tube and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 2 mins. Drain liquid completely.
2. Add 100μL of solution I to pellet, mix well, and keep for 1 minute.
3. Add 1μL of visullyse to the mixture above.
*Note: Addition of visullyse is an optional step.
4. Add 200μL of solution II to the mixture, and mix gently by inverting the tube 4-6 times and then keep at room temperature for 1 min. To prevent contamination from genomic DNA, do not vortex. If visuallyse has been added the solution will do not vortex. If visuallyse has been added the solution will turn blue after addition of solution II. A homogeneously blue suspension should also be observed. If the suspension contains uneven blue color, or white/brownish cell clumps, continue mixing carefully.
5. Add 350μL of solution III, and mix gently. Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute. A fluffy white material forms and lysate should become less viscous. If visualyse has been added in step 3, the suspension should be mixed until all traces of blue has gone and lysate becomes colorless.
6. Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes.
7. Transfer above supernatant (step 6) to the EZ-10 column: centrifuge at 10,000 for 2 minutes.
8. Discard flow-through in the tube. Add 750μL of wash solution to the column, and centrifuge at 10,000rpm for 2 minutes.
9. Repeat wash procedure in step 8.
10. Discard the flow-through in the collection tube. Centrifuge at 10,000rpm for an additional minute to remove any residual wash solution.
11. Transfer the column to a clean 1.5mL microfuge tube. Add 50μL of Elution Buffer into the center part of the column and incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes. Centrifuge at 10,000rpm for 2 minutes.
12. Store purified DNA at -20°C.
For centrifuging culture to pellets:
1. In a 1.5mL tube pipette 1000μL liquid culture.
2. Spin at max speed for 30 sec.
3. Pour off extra media.
4. Pipette 500μL same liquid culture.
5. Pour off rest.
