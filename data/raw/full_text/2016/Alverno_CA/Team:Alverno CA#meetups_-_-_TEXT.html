Alverno iGEM 2016
Meetups
Our team participated in several meetups, both in person and digitally. As a first-year team, we were able to gain invaluable insight on our project and helpful advice. We met with University College London, Lambert High School, and the Peshawar team via Google Hangouts and had very interesting conversations. We also met up with the ULV/CV/LC, a local team at our lab as well as attending the southern California meetup at UCLA.
UCL When we digitally communicated with UCL, we had the great pleasure of meeting Amandeep who graciously gave us advice for our project. She helped us solve some of our crucial problems and helped us troubleshoot a few complications we ran into.
Lambert The Lambert team in Georgia is another high school team that we met up with. The Lambert team is a veteran high school team and gave us advice as to how we could get supplies and machines.
Peshawar We talked with Sarah from the Peshawar team via google hangouts in the beginning of August. We were able to help them by explaining our projected timeline and our work process.
UCLA UCLA was the host of the 2016 iGEM SoCal meetup where we met with several other teams such as UCSD, ULV/LC/CV, and a representative of the Marburg Team in Germany. There we got critical feedback of our project and were able to come up with creative new fundraising ideas.
UCL/LC/CV The Laverne, La Canada, and Crescenta Valley team is a joint College and High School team that is close to us. We met at the UCLA meetup and since then have continued to communicate with them. We have created plans to reach out to other high schools in the area so that can learn about synthetic biology.
