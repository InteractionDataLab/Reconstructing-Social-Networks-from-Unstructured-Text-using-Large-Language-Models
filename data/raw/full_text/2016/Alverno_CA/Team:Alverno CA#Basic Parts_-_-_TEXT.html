Basic & Composite Parts
BBa_K2145000(GG 95):
This part contains two fluorescent protein coding sites (for RFP and GFP) and was assembled using Golden Gate Assembly. To make plasmid, parts were taken from iGEM Registry (BBa_J04450 (RFP) and BBa_I13522 (GFP)) and assembled to make new part with a 500bp spacer in between.
Direction of GFP: Forward, toward the spacer
Direction of RFP: Forward, away from the spacer
BBa_K2145001(GG 96):
This part contains two fluorescent protein coding sites (for RFP and GFP) and was assembled using Golden Gate Assembly. To make plasmid, parts were taken from iGEM Registry (BBa_J04450 (RFP) and BBa_I13522 (GFP)) and assembled to make new part with a 500bp spacer in between.
Direction of GFP: Reverse, away from the spacer
Direction of RFP: Forward, away from the spacer
BBa_K2145104(GG 97):
This part contains two fluorescent protein coding sites (for RFP and GFP) and was assembled using Golden Gate Assembly. To make plasmid, parts were taken from iGEM Registry (BBa_J04450 (RFP) and BBa_I13522 (GFP)) and assembled to make new part with a 500bp spacer in between.
Direction of GFP: Forward, toward the spacer
Direction of RFP: Reverse, toward the spacer
BBa_K2145105(GG 98):
This part contains two fluorescent protein coding sites (for RFP and GFP) and was assembled using Golden Gate Assembly. To make plasmid, parts were taken from iGEM Registry (BBa_J04450 (RFP) and BBa_I13522 (GFP)) and assembled to make new part with a 500bp spacer in between.
Direction of GFP: Reverse, away from the spacer
Direction of RFP: Reverse, toward the spacer
BBa_K2145124(GG 99):
This part contains two fluorescent protein coding sites (for RFP and GFP) and was assembled using Golden Gate Assembly. To make plasmid, parts were taken from iGEM Registry (BBa_J04450 (RFP) and BBa_I13522 (GFP)) and assembled to make new part with a 500bp spacer in between.
Direction of GFP: Forward, away from the spacer
Direction of RFP: Reverse, away from the spacer
BBa_K2145107(GG 100):
This part contains two fluorescent protein coding sites (for RFP and GFP) and was assembled using Golden Gate Assembly. To make plasmid, parts were taken from iGEM Registry (BBa_J04450 (RFP) and BBa_I13522 (GFP)) and assembled to make new part with a 500bp spacer in between.
Direction of GFP: Reverse, toward the spacer
Direction of RFP: Forward, toward the spacer
BBa_K2145126(GG 101):
This part contains two fluorescent protein coding sites (for RFP and GFP) and was assembled using Golden Gate Assembly. To make plasmid, parts were taken from iGEM Registry (BBa_J04450 (RFP) and BBa_I13522 (GFP)) and assembled to make new part with a 500bp spacer in between.

BBa_K2145127(GG 102):
This part contains two fluorescent protein coding sites (for RFP and GFP) and was assembled using Golden Gate Assembly. To make plasmid, parts were taken from iGEM Registry (BBa_J04450 (RFP) and BBa_I13522 (GFP)) and assembled to make new part with a 500bp spacer in between.
Direction of GFP: Reverse, toward the spacer
Direction of RFP: Reverse, away from the spacer
BBa_K2145100(GG 105):
This plasmid contains a GFP and an RFP reporter separated by a 282-bp spacer containing three gRNA binding sites for dCas. The reporter is designed to demonstrate the effect, if any, of binding a dCas "clamp" between two genes (the idea being that such a clamp can limit propagation of supercoiling between the genes, functionally isolating them).
Direction of GFP: Forward, toward the clamps
Direction of RFP: Forward, away from the clamps
BBa_K2145101(GG 106):
This plasmid contains a GFP and an RFP reporter separated by a 282-bp spacer containing three gRNA binding sites for dCas. The reporter is designed to demonstrate the effect, if any, of binding a dCas "clamp" between two genes (the idea being that such a clamp can limit propagation of supercoiling between the genes, functionally isolating them).
Direction of GFP: Reverse, away from the clamps
Direction of RFP: Forward, away from the clamps
BBa_K2145102(GG 107):
This plasmid contains a GFP and an RFP reporter separated by a 282-bp spacer containing three gRNA binding sites for dCas. The reporter is designed to demonstrate the effect, if any, of binding a dCas "clamp" between two genes (the idea being that such a clamp can limit propagation of supercoiling between the genes, functionally isolating them).
Direction of GFP: Forward, toward the clamps
Direction of RFP: Reverse, toward the clamps
BBa_K2145103(GG 108):
This plasmid contains a GFP and an RFP reporter separated by a 282-bp spacer containing three gRNA binding sites for dCas. The reporter is designed to demonstrate the effect, if any, of binding a dCas "clamp" between two genes (the idea being that such a clamp can limit propagation of supercoiling between the genes, functionally isolating them).
Direction of GFP: Reverse, away from the clamps
Direction of RFP: Reverse, toward the clamps
