Alverno iGEM 2016
Interlab Study
Quantifying different sources of variation in gene expression
using         fluorescent transformed E. coli bacteria
Summary:
As part of the 2016 iGEM Interlab Study, we tested 3 different     fluorescent protein expression plasmids, J23101, J23106, and J23117 with     positive and negative controls. We transformed the parts with iGEM's     transformation protocol. Our bacteria were cultured on a LB agar plate and     cultured in LB broth. To measure the differences in fluorescence expressed     by different strength plasmids, we used a plate reader with an OD600     reference point and FITC standard curve.
Project Description:
The 2016 iGEM Interlab Study aims to compare results obtained by various     teams in order to quantify the expression of 5 different constructs using     fluorescence, which provides a useful insight into expression levels that     can be monitored without disrupting cells. Each device used in the study is     in the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone and are fluorescent protein expression     plasmids of different strength promoters. The devices we tested were     J23101, J23106, J23117 (Test Devices 1, 2, and 3). We used positive control     I20270 and negative control R0040. J23101, with a strong promoter, showed     the highest amount of fluorescence. J23117, with a weak promoter, showed     the lowest amount of fluorescence, and J23106, with the medium strength     promoter, showed fluorescence amounts between the other two. Our test     devices were inserted into DH5alpha E. coli, which were transformed     according to the iGEM transformation protocol. Our transformed cells were     plated on LB plates with chloramphenicol and incubated overnight at 37° C.     Two colonies were picked from each plate (with the exception of Test Device     3, with which there was only one) and were inoculated in 15mL test tubes.     These devices were diluted, and then measured in a plate reader with an     excitation wavelength of 35nm, according to iGEM’s measurement     protocol.

Graph of Fluorescence/Absorbance in AU (log scale) over a 6 hour time period. Amounts of Fl/Abs600 are consistent with the strengths of the promoters.
FITC Fluorescence standard curve. Row A had pipetting errors and so is different from the other curves.
