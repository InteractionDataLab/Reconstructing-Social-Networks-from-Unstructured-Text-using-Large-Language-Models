Engagement
To stay engaged with our community we created a variety of social media accounts         ( Twitter YouTube Facebook and Instagram ) as a means to reach out to         other teams, and to keep interested people informed about our         progress.
On those accounts we would post about exciting things occurring in the lab such as autoclaving, micropipetting, and wiki coding!
To see more about our Engagement, look at our Human Practices where we demonstrate ourengagement through Outreach.
