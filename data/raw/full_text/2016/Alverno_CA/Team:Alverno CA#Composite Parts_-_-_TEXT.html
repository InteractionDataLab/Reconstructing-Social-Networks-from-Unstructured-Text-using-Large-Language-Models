Composite Parts
BBa_K2145000:
This part contains two fluorescent protein coding sites (for RFP and GFP) and was assembled using Golden Gate Assembly. To make plasmid, parts were taken from iGEM Registry (BBa_J04450 (RFP) and BBa_I13522 (GFP)) and assembled to make new part with a 500bp spacer in between.

BBa_K2145100:
This plasmid contains a GFP and an RFP reporter separated by a 282-bp spacer containing three gRNA binding sites for dCas. The reporter is designed to demonstrate the effect, if any, of binding a dCas "clamp" between two genes (the idea being that such a clamp can limit propagation of supercoiling between the genes, functionally isolating them).

(Our parts were entered onto the repository as basic parts, however they are actually composite parts. As we used different cloning methods, we decided that we could avoid formatting difficulties by adding them as basic parts.)
