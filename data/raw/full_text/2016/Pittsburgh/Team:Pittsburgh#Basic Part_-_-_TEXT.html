All of our Basic Parts are listed below. The one we found most useful for our project was the pT7 Toehold, Part BBa_K2084002. Part BBa_K2084002 contains a pT7 and a 5'UTR toehold switch that blocks translation of a gene placed downstream unless it is bound and unfolded by a DNA/RNA trigger molecule. As the data below suggests, this toehold switch provides a powerful regulatory element in any circuit and expression of the reporter is dependent on the concentration of the toeholdswitch in a cell-free reaction. For this specific trigger, see Pardee et. al. 2014 . The sequence of the activating oligo trigger is AAGACAATGGTAAGTAGTAATAGATA. For more information about toehold switches and our work with them, visit the Toehold Switch sections in the Project Overview, Experiments, and Results sections.
