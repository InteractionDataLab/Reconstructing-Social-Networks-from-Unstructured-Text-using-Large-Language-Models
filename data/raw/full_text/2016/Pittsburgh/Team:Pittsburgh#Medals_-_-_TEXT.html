Requirement
Our Work
Register and attend
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
To see our registration information, visit this site and search for "Pittsburgh." We're excited to attend the Giant Jamboree in October!
Deliverables
Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page (section 3).
Take a look at our deliverables!
Team Wiki: Teams need to document their project on their Team Wiki page.
This is our Wiki. Visit the home page here .
Poster: Each team must present a poster of their project at the Giant Jamboree.
Take a look at our poster here .
Presentation: Each team has 20 minutes to present their project at the Giant Jamboree. The presentation must be given by a student.
Claire, Maya, Maddie, and Praneeth had a great time presenting at the Jamboree. View the presentation slides here .
Project Attribution: Teams need to attribute all of the work done for their project correctly.
View our attribution page .
Registry Part Pages: Teams must create and document Part pages on the Registry for the Parts they make.
View our Parts here .
Sample Submission: Submit DNA samples of your new Parts to the Registry.
Take a look at our Parts to see what we submitted.

Attribution
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
Huge thanks go out to the wonderful people and groups listed on our attribution page !
Part/Contribution
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part main page.
Take a look at our T3 promoter with a ribosome binding site, Part BBa_K2084004 .

Requirement
Our Work
Validated Part/Validated Contribution
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This working part must be different from the part documented in bronze medal criterion #4.
Take a look at our regulatory ribosome binding site, Part BBa_K2084002 .
Collaboration
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
This year, we collaborated with several teams, including the University of Georgia and William & Mary. Read more about our collaborations here .
Human Practices
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams' exemplary work).
Our project covers education, product design, and risk assessment. Over the summer, we visited summer camps and the Carnegie Science Center to teach kids about synthetic biology and our device. We also met with experts to discuss the practical applications of our sensor. In addition, our modeling project examines the economic impact of lead pollution in drinking water. Read more about our work with human practices here , or on the silver medal criterion page.

Requirement
Our Work
Integrated Human Practices
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Read about our gold medal criterion human practices activities here .
Improve a previous part or project
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part. This part must NOT be from your 2016 part number range.
We characterized the codon-optimized fluorescent proteins developed by the 2015 Carnegie Mellon team. Read more about out work here .
Proof of concept
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept. (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab).
The cleavage product from a DNAzyme activated our reporter protein. Read more about these results here .
