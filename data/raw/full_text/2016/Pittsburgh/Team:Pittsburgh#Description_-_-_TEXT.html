Thank you to our sponsors!
Our improved characterization of codon-optimized fluorescent proteins developed by the 2015 Carnegie Mellon team.
We characterized the proteins as possible reporters for our system. However, we decided not to use fluorescent proteins since they cannot be seen with the naked eye unless they are in high concentration. We added fluorescence and kinetics characterization to the following parts:
YFP, Part BBa_K1732012
OFP, Part BBa_K1732011
BFP, Part BBa_K1732007
GFP, Part BBa_K1732009
RFP, Part BBa_K1732013
All readings were performed on the Tecan M1000. All excitation and emission peaks were close to the reported values except the excitation of GFP. Most proteins (except GFP and OFP) reached maximum fluorescence within 6 hours of growth.
