certain causes to the public. Thus, our team decided to use 
this method to promote synthetic biology and its applications in a
wide variety of sectors within the community.</P><P align="justify">Our team decided to create a Facebook page dedicated to iGem in order 
to enhance the understanding of the public regarding synthetic biology.  As
well, the page was created to inform the public about current topics
and advancements that might t be of interest to them. Planned workshops
were also posted on the page and on the personal social accounts of the 
team members to cater to a wide variety of audience that might be 
interested in synthetic biology.</P><LI><B><I>Survey the Public</I></B></LI><P>Our team wanted to know the initial opinions of the public regarding synthetic biology. As a result, our team conducted a general survey testing the overall understanding of the public about the field, its uses and the various applications that exist today and will possibly exist in the future. The results are illustrated in this section. </P><LI><B><I>Synthetic Biology Workshop</I></B></LI><P align="justify">Based on the prior survey conducted, our decided to host a workshop to further educate the public about synthetic biology. Most people knew about synthetic biology and genetically modified organisms, however, most people were not aware of its various uses and thus, could not form a solid opinion on their use in the manufacturing and production of materials.
Our workshop consisted of a presentation headed by one of our team members and included an engaging activity that allowed the attendees to work with their peers to get a general idea of the process behind the field of synthetic biology.</P></OL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
