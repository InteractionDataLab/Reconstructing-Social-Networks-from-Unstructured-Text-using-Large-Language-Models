Education department of Institut Pasteur  (DDE) of Institut Pasteur
The Education Department offers high-quality courses related to Research and Public Health. It is responsible for PhD students' supervision by providing them tutorials and oversees the Paris Pasteur University Doctoral Program. We would like to thank the Education Department for its financial support. This enabled us to buy consumables, set up public events such as the Parisian Meet-up, the "jeu à débattre" in Bobigny / Paris, whose goal was teaching synthetic biology to young students.
Charpak Fund
The ESPCI Fonds George Charpak promotes entrepreneurial spirit in scientific research at ESPCI. It encourages researchers to apply for a patent and provides financial support to help them. It also fosters quality teaching at ESPCI and seeks fundings for the school. Without the ESPCI Fonds George Charpak, financing our trip to Boston wouldn't have been possible. Thank you for helping us!
Department of Communications and Fundraising - Institut Pasteur
The Department of Communications takes care of all the marketing and business related operations needed to bring exposure to Pasteur research. The Communications and Fundraising Department advertised our project with a marketing campaign including sweat shirts, flyers, posters, goodies etc. We would like to thank them very much for their support.
Department of Development - the Institut Pasteur
The Department of Development supports scientific and strategic ambition of the senior management by developing interdisciplinarity through various programs and by fostering cooperation between academic research and public health. The financial support given by the Department of Development contributed to plan our trip to Boston (plane tickets and housing). Thank you for helping us!
Eurofins
Thanks to you, we were able to sequence our inserts and synthesize the genes for our project. Thank you for your support!
Geneious
Thanks to you, we were able to design our inserts we needed for our project. Thank you for your support!
IDT
Thanks to you, we were able to synthesize the genes we needed for our project. Thank you for your support!
New England Biolabs
The NEB provided us with enzyme kits, and DNA processing kits which we really appreciated!
Pasteur Carnot MI
The Institut Pasteur Carnot MI promotes research with public health biotechnology companies. It wants to understand the mechanisms host/pathogens to help industrial companies in the development of innovative products in therapeutic, diagnostic and vaccination fields. Thanks to Pasteur Carnot MI, we were able to register to the iGEM contest. The financial support provided by the French Embassy in Los Angeles helped us to organize the European experience meet-up in collaboration with the IONIS team.
Research Applications and Industrial Partnerships Department (RAIPD) - Institut Pasteur
The RAIPD's mission is to detect, promote, support, protect and increase the value of inventive activities from research made at Institut Pasteur to industrial partners, French and international institutions so it could benefit public health. We used the financial support to pay the required fees so we could attend to the giant jamboree. Thank you for helping us !
Synenergene: Ratheneau Instituut
Synenergene is a European project that aims to foster an open dialogue on ethical research and innovation in synthetic biology. It cooperates with the Rathenau Instituut whose aim is raising awareness of science and technology among public opinion and politicians. To do so they organize debates and conferences about science and technology. The Synenergene grant helped us to develop the design of our project by using 3D printing and purchase the materials required to build our device. Thank you for helping us with that !
QIAGEN
Thanks for your support!
