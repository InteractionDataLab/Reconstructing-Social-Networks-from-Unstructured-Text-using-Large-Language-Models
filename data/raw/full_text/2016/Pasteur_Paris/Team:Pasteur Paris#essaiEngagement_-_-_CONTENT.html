It was our pleasure to participate in poster sessions of the two most important spring conferences  at the Pasteur Institute.
The International Zika Summit was held from April 25th-26th, 2016. The idea of the summit was to gather scientists and public health professionals  working on the Zika virus and the disease it causes. We had the opporunity to share our ideas with them, but most importantly, to learn more about the virus, which helped us improve the further development of our project.
We participated in the 7th edition of the Young Researchers in Life Sciences conference held from May 18-20, 2016.  This experience was precious to us, since it allowed us to exchange knowledge, experience and interests with other young inspiring minds./br<B><FONT size="4pt">Presentation about Intellectual property law (July 22th, 2016)</FONT></B>
The Paris Sud Jean Monnet university students Claudia, Victoire and Victor of Pasteur Paris iGEM made a presentation in front of the iGEM Team and Mrs.Sandrine Daniel, head of the law of the Human resources Department of Institut Pasteur about Intellectual property law, the concept of Patents, and the aspect of iGEM Open science situation. It was meant to toss around ideas to think about our project and its valorization in the future.<B><FONT size="4pt">Presentation for AMGEN students (August 29th, 2016)</FONT></B>
The Amgen Scholars Program at Institut Pasteur provides twenty undergraduate students from European universities with the possibility to work under supervision on research projects during an eight-week summer internship at Institut Pasteur.

Our presentation was to inform young researchers about Synthetic biology and its many uses, but also to present our project.</DIV><DIV class="text2"><P><B><FONT size="4pt">Festival du vivant (September 15th-16th-17th, 2016)</FONT></B></P>

Whether it will be related to economy, health, agriculture or environment, different exhbits, talks and workshops brought together people from different horizons to meet and discuss, and display devices and concepts.
We presented the 3D printed models of the Mos(kit)o kit, and a poster, alongside ENSCI-Les Ateliers our design student contingency of iGEM Pasteur Paris Team 2016.

The idea was to show in a very concrete way what are laboratory manipulations about. Thus bacterial culture and staining, plasmid DNA isolation, and protein crystals observation were conducted. The school Science, Technology and Maths teachers were also present. Gender equality in science observation and reporting was also also one of the points that was highlighted during the sessions.</DIV><DIV class="gallery"><DIV class="controls"><A class="control-item" href="#item-1">•</A><A class="control-item" href="#item-2">•</A></DIV></DIV><DIV class="text4"><P><B><FONT size="4pt">Mos(kit)o simulation game with middle school students (June 14th, 2016)</FONT></B>
In order to familiarize middle school students to the raising issue of arboviruses, our team went to a middle school to simulate the scenario of our project through a game-like activity.

The day at the school was divided into two phases: in the morning, we gave a quizz to the students in order to test their overall knowledge about synthetic biology and arboviruses. Then, we corrected the test and gave them a little “crash course” on the topic of mosquitoes and arboviruses to prepare them for the afternoon game.
In the afternoon, we organized 2 activities: first, we had the students, in groups of 4, design a mosquito trap and think of how it would be placed and hidden in the environment. The students were extremely creative and had very original ideas like making a chicken-shaped trap in order for it to easily blend into the environment!
                   
They presented their projects in front of the rest of the class and then: game time!

To determine the results of the game, we went to the playground, where boards representing every zone had been placed. Each “zone” contained pieces of information about the zone, explaining why it contained, or didn’t contain, mosquitoes. Each board had mosquito traps attached to it. Each team had to pick 4 traps, the same that they had chosen before.

Then we went back to the classroom where the students opened the traps and counted the number of mosquitoes inside. The team that found the most mosquitoes was the winner!</P></DIV><DIV class="gallery"><DIV class="controls"><A class="control-item" href="#item-3">•</A><A class="control-item" href="#item-4">•</A></DIV></DIV><DIV class="text3"><P>

On Thursday June 16th, the iGEM Pasteur team went to Bobigny to attend a “jeu à débattre” that was hosted by the association, “arbre des connaissances”. Our role was to advise the players during the game, and then, to have a little debate about synthetic biology and the ethical and moral questions it raises. <FONT color="#DF5939">1.	The game</FONT>

The « jeu à débattre » was a simulation game about synthetic biology issues. The students were divided into 5 smaller little groups that each represent a town. Each town starts off with the same number of health, wealth, and environment points.

Then, a series of 5 innovations (all created with synbio) was proposed to every town. The students in each group, representing the citizens of the town, had to decide whether or not they wanted to implement the innovation. The innovations proposed often had a positive economic and/or immediate environmental impact, while being dangerous for public health or the environment in the long term.

After each innovation was proposed and the students debated about them for 10 minutes, they voted on whether to adopt it. After each round, the game leader told the groups the outcome of their decisions, whether it had a positive or negative impact on health, employment, economy, by removing or adding points to their town score.

The winning team is the one with the most points in health, environment and wealth at the end of the game. <FONT color="#DF5939">2.	The debate</FONT>

First, we described our project to the high school students.

Then, the iGEM Pasteur team had a very interesting debate with the students and teachers. They asked questions about:
- Safety issues
- Long term effects of synthetic biology 
- The economic aspect of our project
- How the patch works
- The modification of the human genome, whether or not it was possible and allowed 
- The protection of biotechnological inventions by patent law

The outcome of the day was very positive and the association is willing to collaborate with us again.
