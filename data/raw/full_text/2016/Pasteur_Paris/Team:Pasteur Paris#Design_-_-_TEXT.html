Today, the main way to fight vector-borne diseases is to spray insecticides to kill mosquitoes. Although this method is effective for killing mosquitoes, it introduces another concern. In some cases, authorities spray too much insecticides, which impacts the environment, and it can cause resistance in mosquitoes. So, we wanted to design an environmental surveillance system that would allow us to locate infected mosquitoes, almost in real-time. We will target infected areas and avoid the over spraying of insecticides. Since we transpose the diagnosis to the mosquitos, and not on sick people, we will be able to prevent epidemics. Thatâ€™s one of the novelties of our project. To do so, we designed our Mos(kit)o device. It consists of three main parts: a trapping system, a detection device and mapping software. We created a novel patch, which is the core component of this detection device. It reveals whether the mosquitoes caught earlier are infected by a pathogen.
