Introduction text: Several steps have enabled us to shape finals Moskit(o) devices. This part is about what we call in design the project approach. Initially, we developed different user scenarios to identify each actor and component of the project (By the way, we won the Synenergene call for projects with scenarios !). Then, we defined the visual identity of the Moskit(o) project. Finally, the first sketches came and 3D modeling followed. They were the support of multiple discussions with scientists in order to best adapt the form to the function.  The final step was the conception prototypes. All of these parts are explained in this page, have a good reading !
SCENARIOS
These applications scenarios have allowed us to create the Moskit(o) project. They were validated by Synenergene, a Rathenau’s Institute program (learn more here). Concretely, it’s about answering questions related to our project : security-related impacts, ethics, regulations, technical requirements and especially its use. Indeed, these scenarios have been made in parallel to the development of the science protocols, which strengthened and fed as much the science part, as the design part. We have carried out extensive studies of different contexts to identify actors of the Moskit(o) project, from the manufacturer to the user. The conclusions we made enabled us to enrich our project and make it viable in the near future. All these illustrated scenarios have served many discussions with different specialists we met, but also among members of our team.
Financement et distribution description text:
A kit is provided to local administrations in order to proceed to the trapping of mosquitoes and the detection test. Several devices compose this kit : - Mosquito Traps to be displayed in the environment, in discussion with scientists - For less accessible areas, a drone could be provided to display and take back the trap. - A pack of biofabricated patches for testing mosquito blood - A safe detection kit to carry out the analysis - lysate and rinsing solutions stored in small containers.
Reservists are regular citizens who wants to get involved in the project. Once they are selected through an interview, they receive a small formation teaching them how to manipulate and settle the traps. In case of emergency or high risk of epidemy, they can be called by the local administrator to reinforce the surveillance and help depositing the traps. As the trapping system is very secure, the reservists are never endangered by this operations.
