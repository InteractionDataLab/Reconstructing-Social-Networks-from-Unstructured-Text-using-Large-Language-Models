46. Transformation of bacteria with Ligation of pET43.1/ C1 and C2
Aim:
We want to extract the DNA we tried to transform on June 22, 2016.
The aim is to obtain the construct of C1 in pET43.1 for expression in E. coli. This to serve both the verification of the presence of the pET43.1-C1 plasmid in the cells but also to make a stock of it for future cloning  and expression experiments.
Protocol:

Aim:
Assay the DNA to check if the Midiprep was efficient, and to have the concentration of pET43.1-C1 for transformations and sequencing.
Protocol:
follow in this link
What we did in the lab:
Material:
•pET43.1-C1 obtained by the midiprep kit •plastic uvette (Eppendorf) •spectrophotometer •TE (Tris 10 mM pH 8.0, EDTA 1 mM) buffer Method: 1.  Use a 1/50 dilution of pET43.1-C1 plasmid in TE, volume =500 µl. 2.  We use the spectrophotometer ultrospec 3100 pro- Amersham Bioscience and we do the blank with TE.

Aim:
:  We need to verify that the pET43.1-C1 we isolated from transformation of the ligated products does indeed contain the C1 insert.  In order to achieve that we will split the ligated vector into insert and the plasmid with restriction enzymes.
Protocol:
follow in this link
What we did in the lab:
Material:
•30 µl of pET43.C1 at 162 ng/µl
Method:
n = C*V n = 162 * 30 = 4860 ng We have 4860 ng and we want to digest 400 ng of DNA. 1.  Add all reagent in a 1 ml Eppendorf 2.  Allow the digestion to proceed during 1 h at 37°C. 3.  Incubate 5 min at 65°C to inactivate the enzymes.
Aim:
We didn'tget any inserts, so we decided to repeat the preparation of pET43.1 and also the inserts C1 and C2.
What we did in the lab:
Materials:
•pET43.1 at 86.7 ng/µl, •BamH I, Hind III, Cutsmart buffer, •all restriction reagents being from NEB (New England Biolabs).
Method :
Prepare the mix composed of plasmid DNA, two enzymes, and buffer in an Eppendorf tube.

Aim :
Digestion with new enzymes Xba I and Hind III of inserts (C1 and C2) and pET43.1a(+) We have decided to switch from BamH I Hind III restriction digests to Xba I Hind III so that could remove the region containing a NusA fusion in the pET43.1a vector, as well as the following tags, and protease cleavage sites. This will make a cleaner construct for our protein.
Protocol:

What we did in the lab:
Method:
Prepare the digestion mix for the two inserts C1 and C2, as well as for the pET43.1 vector as in table 19 below. Proceed with the digestion for 1h30 min.

1.  Add all reagents in a 1 ml Eppendorf (1 for C1,1 for C2 and 1 for pET43.1) 2.  Allow digestion to proceed for 1h30 at 37 °C then incubate 5 min at 65°C In Table 20: the inserts are those synthesized by iDT Quantity of enzymes: Xba I: In the meanwhile we also proceeded with some lab tasks including managing the amount of LB media that was at our disposal. We observed that repeated contaminations occurred, so we decided to aliquot the media in smaller volumes to minimize contamination of a very large volume. - We have 500 ml of LB and we aliquot it into 10- 50 ml Falcon tubes. The remainder of the time we proceeded with isolating the digested DNA using a gel extraction kit. But before that we needed to run a gel to separate the digested DNA from undigested one. - We purify the inserts and pET43.1 with the QIAGEN Purification kit. To save time, we prepared another 0.7% agarose gel that we stored at it 4°C with a wet towel containing TAE 1X (Tris-Acetate 10 mM, EDTA 1 mM).
Aim:
Determine the quantity of DNA we have after the gel extraction. We will need to proceed with ligation of the inserts and vectors, and need to establish several ratios accurately.
What we did in the lab:
Materials:
•a 50 µl capacity quartz cuvette
Method:
We use the spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 3100 pro). We diluted our samples: 1 µl of DNA for 49 µl of RNase free water. We made the blank with RNase free water. pET43.1 = 2800 µg/ml. C1= 2700 µg/ml. Vtaken = 1 µlof DNA V(H2O) = 49 µl Vfinal = 50 µl

Figure 4
- We can see that for pET43.1 cut there are 2 bands (the first is pET43.1 digested partially, the second band is pET43.1 totally digested). So we get back bands of pET43.1 undigested, and we digested it again one more time.
Aim:
Get back our DNA digested and proceed with purification.
Protocol:

What we did in the lab:
Method:
To extract DNA we use the Gel Extraction Kit from QIAGEN and we follow the different steps detailed in the kit. Follow the table for the QG buffer volumes

Two lanes were used for an extraction for the pET43.1 (pET43.1(1) and pET43.1(2)). These volumes were too big to be contained in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube so we divided all in two. Finally, we had 8 tubes. At the end of the kit, we pooled pET43.1 (1) and pET43.1 (2) together to reach 80 µl and we pooled C1 and C2. Finally, we stored only 3 tubes at -20°C. Used Gel Extraction Kit 50 (QIAGEN) Ex for QG volumes: We need 3* DNA masses pET43.1 (1)--> m = 0.45 mg V = 3 x 0.45 = 1.3 ml = 1300 µl

- Follow KIT steps but we change step 4-6-7 and 8 - We also sub-divided the pET extraction in 2 more tubes Step 4: for isopropanol, DNA masses are volumes of isopropanol Ex : m(pET43.1(1)) = 225 mg  V(pET43.1(1)) = 225 µl Step 6: We wash twice (we used 750 µl of PE buffer) Step 7: Put columns on 1.5 ml Eppendorf Step 8: Add 20 µl of buffer EB and centrifuge it 1 min. After that, put it in the second column and add 20 µl of buffer EB. - We have 4*20 µl tubes of pET43.1 so we regroup all of them in 1 tube. Finally, we have 1 tube for pET43.1 with 80 µl of DNA
Aim:
We want to take back the plasmid and the inserts digested.
Protocol:

What we did in the lab:
Method:
Mixing all of reactants and let digest during 1h30 at 37 °C. pET43.1 at 130 ng/µl will be digested by Hind III (NEB) and Xba I (NEB)                 Follow table 25.

According to these results, we decided to reconcentrate the pET43.1 by using a PCR Clean-Up Kit from QIAGEN. We follow the kit steps. • Spectrophotometer Ultrospec 3100 pro Dilute 1/50 in TE A260 nm=0.036 C = 90 ng/ µl m = 4500 ng We found that our results were strange so we use another spectrophotometer •Spectrophotometer Ultrospec 2100 pro: blank made with TE buffer •pET43.1 (dilution factor 400)   A260 nm + 0.007, C = 140 ng/ µl                     n= 40 x 140= 5600 ng Blank made with NE and dilution 2.5/100 for the inserts C1 and C2. C1: A260 nm= 0.009  --> C = 180 ng/µl N = 7200 ng C2: A260nm = 0.010 --> C= 200 ng/µl m = 8000 ng • Nanodrop: blank made with TE buffer

We pooled the two pET43.1a(+), we finally have 4620 ng of DNA in 200 µl. We use a gel and protein purification kit Nucleospin to reconcentrate it. We follow the kit steps and finally have 20 µl. Then, we measure again the quantity of DNA (blank made with NE) C = 29.5 ng/ µl so 590 ng of DNA in 20 µl.
Aim:
Avoid the self religation of the digested plasmid. This step makes the ligation with inserts easier, as the phosphate required for forming the phosphodiester bridge is provided by the insert, therefore the reaction occurs in trans.
Protocol:
follow in this link
What we did in the lab:
Method:
1.  In a 1 ml Eppendorf, we put 20 µl of DNA (590 ng of pET43.1) 1 µl of rSAP (recombinant shrimp alkaline phosphatase) (diluted 1/3), 2.4 µl of buffer and 0.6 µl of H20 2.  Allow the digestion to proceed during 30 min at 37°C 3.  Incubate 5 min at 65°C to inactivate the enzyme
Aim:
Make the plasmid bind with the inserts before the transformation.

• DNA reconcentration: To dephosphorylate our vector, we need use less than 50 µl, so we reconcentrate this with the PCR clean-up Gel Extraction Kit (Macherey-Nagel). NTI volumes: We need 2* DNA volumes pET43.1 (1)--> V = 90 µl --> V = 2*90 = 180 µl Follow the kit steps Elute in 50 µl DNA measurements: We try do some measurement of our vector with Eppendorf Uvette on the spectrophotometer ultrospec 3100 pro but they indicate we have more DNA than we digested. The error rate for low DNA concentration is too important with this plastic cuvette. So we use a quartz cuvette but the error rate for low DNA concentration is too important with this cuvette too. So we use Nanodrop

After this third transformation without colony, we did an electrophoresis with ligation products. It is also oo check if the ligation was successful or not. This is unusual as the amount of material used is quite low. However, without proof of the ligation working we cannot ascertain many parameters, including transformaton procedures, presence of DNA, etc..
Protocol:

What we did on the lab:
Material:
• pET43.1a plasmid (obtained with midiprep done 16/06/16) • pET43.1a plasmid cut by Hind III/Xba I • C1 and C2 cut by Hind III/Xba I • gel 0.7% agarose • TAE 0.5X buffer • Electrophoresis generator at 130 V • DNA ladder (Thermoscientific Gene ruler 1 kb) • P10 pipet, P20 pipet, test tube 250 ml, electrophoresis BIORAD Mini-Sub Cell GT, 2 type of tips, 1.5 ml Eppendorf sterile tubes, 37°C water bath, shaking incubator centrifuge 5415D,
Method:
1. We redo the ligation of pET43.1 digested with C1 (refer on the June 30, 2016 for protocol) but we let the ligation run for one hour at RT. 2.  We made a 0.7% agarose gel 3.  Fill the electrophoresis chamber with TAE 0.5X 4.  Follow this deposit table Deposit table : L1 --> Ladder 10 µl (Gene ruler) L2-4 -->pET43.1 uncut (reference at 7000 bp) L5-7 --> pET43.1 digested and dephosphorylated L8-10 --> C1 + pET43.1 (1:0) L11 --> C1 + pET43.1 (1:1) L12 --> C1 + PET43.1  (1:3) 5.  Put the voltmeter at 130 V during about one hour Results:We see nothing on the gel, no DNA in our tubes. We probably made a mistake when we performed the experiment.
