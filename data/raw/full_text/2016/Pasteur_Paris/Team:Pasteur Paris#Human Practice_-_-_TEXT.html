TIMELINE Communication & Collaboration
25-26th April 2016
Zika Summit 2016
Zika Summit is a conference that aims to bring together scientists and public health professionals around the world working on Zika. We had the opportunity to present our project to professionals working on this arbovirus.

CIBU lab meeting
CIBU is the Urgent Response to Biological Threats at the Institut Pasteur, supervised by Jean-Claude Manuguerra. We presented our project in front of all members of the CIBU lab and exchanged ideas about our method of detection, our global device, and the intellectual property protection offered at iGEM during the Q & A session that followed  our talk.
19th May 2016
Young Researchers in Life Sciences
The YRLS is a conference organized by young researchers (PhD, Post-docs, junior faculty) that features an interactive program which includes poster sessions, talks and round tables designed for other fellow young researchers. The wide variety of represented disciplines and topics allows attendees to deepen their knowledge of their own research field while broadening their horizons. We had the opportunity to present our project at the conference as a Poster.
20th May 2016
introduction to labWORK FOR middle school student
The idea was to show in a very concrete way what are laboratory manipulations about. Thus bacterial culture and staining, plasmid DNA isolation, and protein crystals observation were conducted. The school Science, Technology and Maths teachers were also present. Gender equality in science observation and reporting was also also one of the points that was highlighted during the sessions.
14th June 2016
The game at the Germaine de Staël school
The Mos(KIT)O  system was simulated as a game with school students. In order to familiarize them to the raising issue of arboviruses, our team went to a middle school to simulate the scenario of our project through a game-like activity. They were asked to come up with a check-list of items to include in a trap, and also search for mosquitoes according to a prior explained affinity map (Forest, lakes, homes, wet areas etc).
16th June 2016
"jeu à débattre" with the association "arbre des connaissances"
On Thursday June 16th, the iGEM Pasteur team went to attend a "Jeu à débattre" that was hosted by the association, "arbre des connaissances". This is a debate practice or round table where several synthetic biology processes are made available to a few villages, and the inhabitants have to decide for the pros and cons of acquiring them, considering environmental, economical, and health benefits. Our role was to advise the players during the game, and then to have a little debate about synthetic biology and the ethical and moral questions it raises. We also addressed the “legal” aspect as viewed from the point of view of French and US Law.
28th June 2016
Meeting with Anna-Bella Falloux
We met Anna-Bella Failloux (entomologist, head of Arboviruses and Insect Vectors (AIV) research unit in the department of virology at Institut Pasteur) to have detailed information on mosquito ecology/habitat (types:aedes, culex) and behavior during feeding sorties(anthropophily, hematophagy).

Ratheneau Institut
The Ratheneau Institut is in cooperation with Synenergene, there aim is to foster an open dialogue on ethical research and innovation in synthetic biology. The Ratheneau Institut want to raising awareness of science and technology among public opinion and politicians. To do so they organize debates and conferences about science and technology. Since July, the Ratheneau Institut helped us to develop our project by guiding us on the steps for our scenarios. With their support and advice, we could develop an Application Scenario and Technomoral Scenario. !
2-3th July 2016
The European experience
We participated in the meet-up hosted by our friends from iGEM Ionis, and iGEM Evry. We had the opportunity to meet the European teams, and we took the opportunity to present them our project.
6th July 2016
Presentation at the ENSCI
After a couple introductory lectures on research in design, biomaterials and synthetic biology, the Pasteur Paris iGEM 2016 team presented the Mos(kit)o project to the ENSCI-Les Ateliers school. This is one of the top design schools in the World (Red Dot Award 2015).
19th July 2016
Meeting with Civic drone
The meeting with Civic drone was intended to discuss with professionals to have more accurate information concerning the use of drones. This strategy concerns the part of the Mos(kit)o project related to remote access to areas with difficult terrain/climate levels. In particular we wanted to discuss data archiving, uploading, deposition-retrieval and analysis of Mos(kit)o traps anchorage to the UAVs.
22th July 2016
Presentation about Intellectual property law
The Paris Sud Jean Monnet university students Claudia, Victoire and Victor of Pasteur Paris iGEM made a presentation in front of the iGEM Team and Sandrine Daniel, head of the law of the Human resources Department of Institut Pasteur about Intellectual property law, the concept of Patents, and the aspect of iGEM Open science situation. It was meant to toss around ideas to think about our project and its valorization in the future.
6th Aug 2016
Meet-up Ile-de-France
With help from two other Parisian teams, iGEM Paris Saclay and iGEM IONIS, we hosted the iGEM Ile-de-France MeetUp on August 6 at the Institut Pasteur. This event was the highlight of our summer. The attendees of the MeetUp were people from iGEM Paris Bettencourt, iGEM Evry, iGEM Ionis, iGEM UPMC (IMPACT), iGEM Aix-Marseille (one member), and iGEM Paris Saclay. We indeed had to abide to strong security requirements considering current state of Emergency in France.
26th Aug 2016
Meeting with EID
Méditerranée (Entente Interdépartementale de Démoustication = Interdepartmental Mediterranean board for the control of mosquito). This organization is in charge of the fight against mosquito epidemics, which is recognized as a mission of public interest, for the Ministry of Health in France. Therefore EID is acting by delegation of authority, in a similar level as the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in the US. Our interview with Gregory Lambert (medical entomologist, coordinator of EID) has allowed us to have more information on mosquito behavior: •Questions such as: How to lure them into the traps? •What are the strategic areas to place our kit? •How to optimize prevention? All these details have allowed us to work in a more targeted way, so that our project is as efficient as possible, taking into account the mosquito lifestyle and optimizing safety for surrounding populations.
29th Aug 2016
Presentation for AMGEN students
The Amgen Scholars Program at Institut Pasteur provides twenty undergraduate students from European universities with the possibility to work under supervision on research projects during an eight-week summer internship at Institut Pasteur. Our presentation was to inform young researchers about Synthetic biology and its many uses, but also to present our project.
15/16/17th Sept 2016
Festival du vivant
Whether it will be related to economy, health, agriculture or environment, different exhbits, talks and workshops brought together people from different horizons to meet and discuss, and display devices and concepts. We presented the 3D printed models of the Mos(kit)o kit, and a poster, alongside ENSCI-Les Ateliers our design student contingency of iGEM Pasteur Paris Team 2016.
