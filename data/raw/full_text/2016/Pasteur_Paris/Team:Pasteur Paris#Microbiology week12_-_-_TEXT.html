Aim :
To start a culture for Miniprep of insert A1/A2 and D1/D2.
In order to obtain a large amount of plasmid, we need to grow the bacteria overnight.
Protocol :
follow in this link
What we did in the lab :
Materials :
• Microbiology equipment (type of incubator, Bunsen burner, water bath, etc… Follow this link )
• 15 ml Falcons
• Carbenicillin 50 mg/ml
• LB medium
Method :
1. One colony is picked from the plates and shaken in 5.0 ml of LB supplemented with Carbenicillin at 50 µg/ml and 4 colonies are taken from each insert.
2. The flask is placed in a shaking incubator at 37°C, 150 rpm overnight.
Aim :
To perform a Miniprep to isolate plasmid DNA of pET43.1(a+) with the inserts A1/A2 and D1/D2 from cultures made on the 25/08.
The amplification method to increase the amount of plasmid is called Miniprep.
Only 25 colonies grow.
Protocol:
follow in this link
What we did in the lab :
Materials :
• 50 ml Falcon tube
• Shaking incubator (INFORS HT)
• Swing bucket centrifuge (JOUAN GR41)
• QIAGEN Miniprep kit
• Microbiology equipment (type of incubator, Bunsen burner, water bath, etc… Follow this link )
Method :
The protocol in step 1 ask for spinning at 6000 g but we can only achieve 3500 g so we used 3500 g for 8 minutes. We will follow most of the protocol of QIAGEN Miniprep 2016 except for a few modifications, which we describe, therefore, below.
Colonies that grow are : A1 (1), A1 (2), A1 (3), A2 (1), A2 (2), A2 (3), A2 (4), D1 (2), D2 (1), D2 (2), D2 (3), D2 (4),
Aim:
Measure the quantity of plasmid using a Nanodrop (Thermofisher).
What we did in the lab :
Materials :
• Nanodrop (Thermofisher)
• Elution buffer from QIAGEN kit
• Microbiology equipment (type of incubator, Bunsen burner, water bath, etc… Follow this link )
Method :
1. Analyze absorbance at 260nm.
2. Clean the Nanodrop with water.
3. Make the blank with 1 µl of elution buffer.
4. Put 1 µl of your sample on the Nanodrop.
5. Make the measure and clean the Nanodrop between each measure.

Aim :
To get back our insert from the Miniprep with appropriate enzymes.
We perform restriction enzyme digestion in order to recover our inserts. We choose appropriate restriction sites based on the host plasmid.
A1(3 tubes) / A2 (4 tubes)
Protocol :
follow in this link
What we did in the lab :
Materials:
• Restriction enzymes: HindIII (New England Biolabs, NEB)
• Restriction enzyme + buffer : XbaI Remix (New England Biolabs, NEB)
• 37°C water bath
• UV spectrophotometer
Method:
1. Mix all the reagents and let digest during 2 hours at 37°C.
⚠ Big volumes must be added first!
2. Make a global mix to be more accurate as we have 25 tubes.
3. Beginning of digestion at 12:15AM.

2. Incubate 10 min at 65°C to inactivate the enzymes.
Aim:
This step check the digestion efficiency of A1(3 tubes) / A2 (4 tubes).
Moreover, the inserts will be purified during this step because they will be extracted from the gel.
We also depose inserts D1 and D2 undigested to check.
Protocol:

What we did in the lab:
Materials:
• Electrophoresis cuve
• TAE 1X
• Gene ruler (Thermoscientific 1kb plus)
• Loading dye
• Agarose
• UV table
• BET
Method:
1. Each well can contain 40 µl so we made a big gel with 20x2 lines. Each sample will contain 36 µl as we add 6 µl of loading dye.  2. Follow the deposit table :

Results:
All the digestion have worked except A1 (3) that seems to be contaminated. Moreover, D2 (2) and D2 (3) seems to have the insert so we will have to digest them.
Aim:
To perform a gel extraction to isolate insert DNA purified from its plasmid thanks to the migration. We use the gel made before with inserts B2/E1/E2 but we only extract B2 bands.
