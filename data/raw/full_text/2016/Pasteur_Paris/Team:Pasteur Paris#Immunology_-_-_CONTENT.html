For pathogen detection, we used the following experimental procedure:  
First, infected mosquitoes are grinded in order to expose pathogen proteins. Then, mosquitoes proteins and pathogen proteins of the sample are bind to horse-radish peroxidase (HRP). The conjugated proteins are deposited on are the patch precoated with specific antibodies. The patch is then washed, pathogen proteins are retained by antibodies, and peroxidase activity is revealed using a specific substrat. 

The principle of that method had to be tested before running experiment. In particular, specificity and sensitivity had to be evaluated. For those tests, we used purified viral proteins (E-protein from Yellow fever virus or E2 protein from chikungunya virus) and specific antibodies (4G2 for E-protein of Yellow fever virus and 3E4 antibody for E2 protein from chikungunya virus). 

We first checked that we were able to bind viral proteins with HRP, then that we could detect viral protein on a membrane, either purified or diluted in a Bovine Serum Albumine (BSA) solution in order to mimic mosquitoes proteins. Next step was to test the method when viral proteins were diluted with mosquitoes proteins. Finally, we tested the patches ability to detect viral pathogens from infected mosquitoes. For this last experiment, all steps involving infectious materials were performed by one of the coaches in a BSL3.<U><B>Materiel:</B></U>

E(YFV):

We mixed 289µL of E(YFV) with 711µL H2O to have a 1mg/mL solution into 1mL = 100 dilution. We have 2 conditions x 8 wells of dilution.

For those experiments using ELISA plates, we have never been able to get any signal. We decided to move to a more relevant system that would mimic the patches we were developing and allow us to get better results.

100 mosquitoes were grinded and CHIKV E2 envelope proteins were diluted into in order to have approximately the same amount of viral proein we would find into one infected mosquito alone and in one infected mosquito together with 100 non-infected mosquitoes in order to mimic the fact that not all mosquitoes trapped will be infected with a pathogen. <U>Results:</U></P></DIV><DIV class="text1"><P>
Signal differences cannot be evaluated with naked eye, so we used My Image Analysis software to quantify the signal. We concluded that our technic is able to detect viral antigen specifically, although we have to greatly improve sensitivity and specificity. 
</P></DIV><DIV id="J10"><H2><B>October, 14th </B></H2></DIV><DIV class="text1"><P><U>Aim:</U> Proof of concept. 
In this experiment, we used 8 prototype patches to check their ability to detect pathogens in mosquitoes.
4 patches were used to repeat the previous experiments in real conditions. The 4 patches remaining were used to test infected mosquitoes. <I>Aedes  aegypti</I> were experimentally infected with the vaccinal strain of Yellow fever virus. 14 days after infection, they were grinded in 1,5 ml tubes. Tubes were centrifuged and supernatant were inactivated by placing the tubes under a UV lamp for 30 minutes. All steps using infectious materials were performed by a coach in a BSL3. .
Samples were then tested on the patch using the same protocol as decribed previously with the patch as a solid support for antibody (in remplacement of membranes). </P></DIV><DIV class="text1"><P><U>Results:</U>
Results are unconclusive for this experiment, but a tendancy seems to appears. Indeed, patch number 3, with specific antibody and viral protein displays the highest signal but the background seems to be elevated as well, as shown by the signal in membrane number 2. Thus, no statistical differences could be shown with a single experiment. Anyway, the sensitivity has to be improved for detecting pathogens at a lower level. Using our technic, we were not able to detect viral protein in infected mosquitoes. 

This experiment needs to be completed with more test, using different antibody and protein dilution. Sadly, we hadn’t enough protein to produce more patch, so we were not able to repeat the experiment.
