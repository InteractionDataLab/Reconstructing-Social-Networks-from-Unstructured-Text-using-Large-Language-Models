Week 13
August 29, 2016:
232. Measure the amount of DNA extracted from the miniprep
September 1, 2016:
233. Harvest the culture with Midiprep
September 2, 2016:
234. Growth of bacteria
235. Extraction of plasmid DNA
Aim: Measure the quantity of plasmid using a Nanodrop (Thermofisher) before sending for sequencing (inserts B1 and C2)
What we did in the lab:
Materials:
• Nanodrop (Thermofisher)
• Elution buffer from QIAGEN kit
• Microbiology equipment (type of incubator, Bunsen burner, water bath, etc… Follow this link )
Method:
1. Analyze absorbance at 260nm
2. Clean the Nanodrop with water
3. Make the blank with 1µl of elution buffer
4. Put 1 µl of your sample on the Nanodrop
5. Make the measure and clean the Nanodrop between each measure
Results:

Aim: To start a culture for Miniprep of insert C2 in pET43.1a in BL21(DE3) from 22/08 and A1/C2 in pET43.1a in TOP1O.
In order to obtain a large amount of plasmid, we need to grow the bacteria overnight.
Protocol: follow in this link
What we did in the lab:
Materials:
• Microbiology equipment (type of incubator, Bunsen burner, water bath, etc… Follow this link )
• 50 ml erlenmeyers
• Carbenicillin 50 mg/ml
• LB medium
Method:
1. One colony is picked from the plates and shaken in 25.0 ml of LB supplemented with Carbenicillin at 50 µg/ml.
2. The flask is placed in a shaking incubator at 37°C, 150 rpm overnight.
Aim: Produce our protein in BL21(DE3) competent cells, the production is induced with IPTG once it reaches an optical density of 0.7.
Protocol: follow in this link
What we did in the lab:
Materials:
• Two 2 l erlenmeyers
• LB (Luria broth)
• IPTG (0.1 M)
• Precultures in 25 ml Erlenmeyers
• UV spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 3100)
• Shaking incubator (INFORS HT)
• Centrifuge
• Buffer A (50mM Tris, 150mM of NaCl)
Method:
1. Put 1 l of LB in each erlenmeyer and make them warm with the shaking incubator at 37°C and 150 rpm.
2. Once warmed, add 12.5 ml of preculture in each erlenmeyer.
3. Let grow in the shaking incubator.
4. Measure the absorbance with the UV spectrophotometer every 30min

6. The last measure before induction is pelleted 3min at 8000g and stored at -20°C.
7. Let induce overnight in the shaking incubator
8. After 7 hours of induction, measure the OD600 nm and store the measure pelleted at -20°C.
9. Centrifuge at 4500RPM the culture and throw out the supernatant, the pellet resuspended in 5ml of buffer A are stored at -80°C before protein extraction.
Aim: To perform a Midiprep to isolate plasmid DNA of pET43.1(a+) with the inserts A1/C2 from cultures made on the 1set of August.
The amplification method to increase the amount of plasmid is called Midiprep.
Protocol: follow in this link
What we did in the lab:
Materials:
• 50 ml Falcon tube
• Shaking incubator (INFORS HT)
• Swing bucket centrifuge (JOUAN GR41)
• QIAGEN Miniprep kit • Microbiology equipment (type of incubator, Bunsen burner, water bath, etc… Follow this link )
Method:
The protocol in step 1 ask for spinning at 6000g but we can only achieve 3500 g so we used 3500 g for 8 minutes. We will follow most of the protocol of QIAGEN Miniprep 2016 except for a few modifications, which we describe, therefore, below.
Follow QIAGEN kit steps with a final volume of 100 µl
