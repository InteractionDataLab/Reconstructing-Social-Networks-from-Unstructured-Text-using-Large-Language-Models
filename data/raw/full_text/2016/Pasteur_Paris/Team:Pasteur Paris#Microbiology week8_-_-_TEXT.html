3. Put the tubes in a PCR machine heat to 94°C during 1 minute and then add the enzyme.
Aim :
Test the specificity of our two primers : For and Rev.
Protocol :
follow in this link
What we did in the lab :
Materials :
• 100 ml Erlenmeyer
• TAE 1X
• Agarose gel
• Ethidium bromide drops (EB)
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Gene ruler ladder
• Loading buffer 6X
• DNA (C1 and C2, For and Rev)
Method :
1. Prepare a 0.7% agarose gel :
1.a In an Erlenmeyer of 100 ml, put 50 ml of TAE 1X and add 0.35 g of agarose
1.b Warm it in a microwave 2 minutes and let it cool down a little
1.c Add 2 drops of EB and mix it
1.d Transfer it on combs in a gel caster and let it solidify
2. Put samples in the wells:

Aim: Extracting DNA from the colony obtained after transformation.
Protocol: follow in this link
Materials :
• Miniprep QIAGEN Kit
• TOPO cloning colony
• Buffer EB
• Spectrophotometer
Method
1. For the Miniprep prepare 6x 2 ml of cultures and recover it in 50 μl of buffer EB
2. Do the prep with the QIAGEN Miniprep Kit
3. Measure the absorbance of the products to determine the amount of DNA obtained after extraction
