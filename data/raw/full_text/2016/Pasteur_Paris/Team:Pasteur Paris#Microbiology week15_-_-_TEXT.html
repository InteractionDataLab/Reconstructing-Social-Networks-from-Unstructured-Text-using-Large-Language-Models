Week 15
September 12, 2016:
242. Digestion of the plasmid pSB1C3
September 15, 2016:
243. Measure the amount of DNA extracted from the miniprep
244. Digestion of the plasmid pSB1C3 and inserts A1/A2/B1/B2/C1/C2/D1/D2/E1/E2
245. Electrophoresis on agarose gel
246. DNA extraction
September 16, 2016:
247. Measure the amount of DNA extracted from the miniprep
Aim: To have the right restriction sites to perform the ligation and the cloning. We choose appropriate restriction sites based on our inserts. Protocol: follow in this link
What we did in the lab: Materials: • Restriction enzymes: Xba I, Spe I (New England Biolabs, NEB) • Restriction enzyme buffers • 37°C water bath • UV spectrophotometer • pSB1C3 (48ng/µl) Method: 1. Mix all the reagents and let digest during 1 hour at 37°C ⚠ Big volumes must be added first!

2. Incubate 10 min at 65°C to inactivate the enzymes. 3. Add 2 µl of rSAP in order to perform the dephosphorylation. 3. Store at -20°C
Aim: Measure the quantity of plasmid using a Nanodrop (Thermofisher) What we did in the lab: Materials: • Nanodrop (Thermofisher) • Elution buffer from QIAGEN kit • Microbiology equipment (Follow this link) Method: 1. Analyze absorbance at 260 nm 2. Clean the Nanodrop with water 3. Make the blank with 1μl of elution buffer 4. Put 1μl of your sample on the Nanodrop 5. Make the measure and clean the Nanodrop between each measure Results:

Aim: This step check the digestion efficiency of B1 (2 tubes)/B2 (2 tubes)/ C1 / C2 / A1 / A2 / D2 / E1 / E2. Moreover, the inserts will be purified during this step because they will be extracted from the gel.
Protocol: follow in this link
What we did in the lab: Materials: • Electrophoresis cuve • TAE 1X • Gene ruler (Thermoscientific 1kb plus) • Loading dye • Agarose • UV table • Ethidium bromide drops (EB) Method: Each well will contain 25 µl of DNA and 6 µl of Loading Dye. Follow the next deposit table : Line 1: Ladder (6 µl) | Ø | B2-col7 | Ø | B2-col9 | Ø | B1-col6 | Ø | B1-col9 | Ø | C1 | Ø | C2 Line 2: Ladder (6 µl) | Ø | D2 | Ø | E1 | Ø | E2 | Ø | pSB1C€3 | Ø | A1 | Ø | A2
Aim: To perform a gel extraction to isolate insert DNA purified from its plasmid thanks to the migration. We use the gel made before with inserts B1 (2 tubes)/B2 (2 tubes)/ C1 / C2 / A1 / A2 / D2 / E1 / E2 but we only extract B2 bands. Protocol: follow in this link
What we did in the lab: Materials: • Scalpel • 2 ml Eppendorfs • Balance • UV table • Microbiology equipment (type of incubator, Bunsen burner, water bath, etc… Follow this link ) • QIAGEN Gel Extraction Kit Method: ⚠ Be aware of the risks! UV light burns the eyes and skin so make sure you have the right protection Follow QIAGEN Kit steps according to the next tables for the volumes of QG buffer.
