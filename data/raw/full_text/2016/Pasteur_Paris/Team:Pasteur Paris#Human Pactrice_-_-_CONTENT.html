We performed bacterial culture and staining and plasmid DNA isolation, as well as protein crystal observations were conducted. The school science, technology, and math teachers were also present. Gender equality in science observation and reporting was also one of the points that was highlighted during the sessions.</P></DIV></ARTICLE><ARTICLE><DIV class="inner"><SPAN class="date"><SPAN class="day">14<SUP>th</SUP></SPAN><SPAN class="month">June</SPAN><SPAN class="year">2016</SPAN></SPAN><H2>Mos(kit)o GAME AT THE GERMAINE DE STAËL SCHOOL</H2><P> Our team visited the Germaine de Staël Middle School in order to familiarize students to the raising issue of arboviruses and with our project. We started the day with a quiz and general presentation about mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit before simulating the scenario of our project through a game-like activity. They were asked to imagine a trap design matching our requirements and then search for mosquitoes in mock-up traps placed in the playground, according to a prior explained affinity map (i.e., forest, lakes, homes, swamps).</P></DIV></ARTICLE><ARTICLE><DIV class="inner"><SPAN class="date"><SPAN class="day">16<SUP>th</SUP></SPAN><SPAN class="month">June</SPAN><SPAN class="year">2016</SPAN></SPAN><H2>&quot;jeu à débattre&quot; with the association &quot;arbre des connaissances&quot;</H2><P>On Thursday June 16th, the iGEM Pasteur team attended a &quot;Jeu à débattre&quot; hosted by the association, &quot;arbre des connaissances&quot;. This was a debate practice or round table discussion where several synthetic biology innovations were made available to a few villages. The inhabitants had to decide the pros and cons of acquiring them, considering environmental, economical, and health benefits. Our role was to advise the players during the game and to moderate a little debate about synthetic biology and the ethical and moral questions it raises. We also addressed patenting aspects,  as viewed from the point of view of French and US Law. </P></DIV></ARTICLE><ARTICLE><DIV class="inner"><SPAN class="date"><SPAN class="day">28<SUP>th</SUP></SPAN><SPAN class="month">June</SPAN><SPAN class="year">2016</SPAN></SPAN><H2>Meeting with Anna-Bella Falloux</H2><P>We met <B>Dr. Anna-Bella Failloux </B>  (entomologist, head of Arboviruses and Insect Vectors (AIV) research unit in the department of virology at Institut Pasteur) to have detailed information on mosquito ecology/habitat (types: aedes, culex) and behavior during feeding ventures (anthropophily, hematophagy).</P></DIV></ARTICLE><ARTICLE><DIV class="inner"><SPAN class="date"><SPAN class="month">JulyOcto</SPAN><SPAN class="year">2016</SPAN></SPAN><H2> Rathenau Institut</H2><P><B>The Ratheneau Institute</B>  « promotes the formation of political and public opinion on science and technology&quot; in cooperation with Synenergene, a European project that aims to foster an open dialogue on responsible research and innovation in synthetic biology.
