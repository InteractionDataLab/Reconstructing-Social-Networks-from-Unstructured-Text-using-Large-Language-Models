The Pasteur 2016 team is one of the few iGEM formations to include lawyers. Their job is to handle the intellectual property aspects of the project, thus providing the team with expertise on questions such as patents, open data licenses, and protection of both the industrial designs, and the trademarks. They also serve as a legal support to frame the project according to the legislations in effect.
Furthermore, and in order to build a responsible device regarding, health, safety, privacy, economy, and environmental considerations, the three law students are in charge of ethics-related aspects of the project.
