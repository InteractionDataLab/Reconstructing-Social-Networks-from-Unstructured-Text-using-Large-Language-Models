Protocols
During our lab work we used the following protocols. You can also download all the protocols in one file here:
Experiments
Aim:
Download
Microbiology equipment
Materials always used in the lab
PCR
To reproduce (amplify) selected sections of DNA (inserts A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, E1,E2).
Digestion
To linearize the different plasmids with appropriate enzymes. Perform restriction enzyme digestion in order to recover linear backbones of the plasmids. And chose the appropriate restriction sites based on the host plasmids.
Dephosphorylation
To reduce vector self-ligation and favor that of vector to insert instead.
Ligation
To link an insert to its host plasmid before the transformation. This step happens after the digestion of the insert and the plasmid with the same restriction sites enzymes.
Electrophoresis
To know the size of DNA fragments to check the efficiency of a digestion for instance.
Gel extraction kit
To get back the DNA purified thanks to the electrophoresis on agarose gel.
Transformation
To increase the amount of plasmid by transformation in competent cells. The amount of plasmid supplied is insufficient to perform all our future experiments.
Miniprep QIAGEN Kit
To extract DNA from a culture of bacteria
Harvest and culture
In order to obtain a large amount of plasmid, we need to grow the bacteria overnight.
Stab culture
To store a clone of bacteria to be used later.
IPTG induction
To increase the production of our protein which depends on this molecule.
Protein Purification Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography
To check if the His-tag works and if our protein has really been produced
Cellulose-binding Protocol
Verify that the C2 protein binds to cellulose.
Silification & assay Protocol
Prepare a one pot mixture that will be compressed directly after incubation.
Model of the mechanical properties of the patch
Predict the influence of silification on the mechanical properties of the patch
Patch compression Protocol
Make a patch by compression with cellulose and the silicated C2 protein.
One pot mixture-Patch protocol
Prepare a one pot mixture that will be compressed directly after incubation.
Antibody-binding Protocol
The goal is to determine whether our immunoassay is effective. We want to ensure that our antibodies are well able to detect the presence or absence of viral proteins from Chikungunya and Yellow Fever viruses.
