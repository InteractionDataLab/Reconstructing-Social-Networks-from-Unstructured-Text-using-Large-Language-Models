We took into account every aspect of human practice into our project, firstly, we integrated HP into the work by backing up every scientific research and lab experiments with an upstream human practice study. In addition to that, we have been careful to thoughtfully implement our work in the actual context, to make sure it addresses current concerns of our society. In the process, we were careful not to skip any step and to develop our project in a didactic manner, that hopefully can be built upon by others (all of our research and methods can be found in the wiki). Finally, we spread the word about our team and our project as much as possible, and we got very positive feedback (from school pupils, high school students, scientists and the general public, and hopefully our project and our team has inspired some of them.  <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Pasteur_Paris/Integrated_Practices">(evidence)</A><FONT size="5pt" color="#0e6671">Education and Public engagement</FONT>:Our team focused a great part of the work on education and public engagement, in an attempt to reach the most various public possible starting with middle school and high school students, through game-like activities followed by animated debats. Then moving on to a more informed audience during conferences and scientific events (such as the Zika summit and the “Festival Vivant” where we presented our project in front of the public, generating a constructive discussion. And finally, we did our best at sparking the public’s interest by reaching out to them through polls, both online and on the street. We would like to believe these exchanges resulted in a win-win situation, since both our team and the public learnt a lot from these interactions.  <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Pasteur_Paris/Engagement">(evidence)</A><FONT size="5pt" color="#0e6671">Entrepreneurship</FONT>: The cross-track entrepreneurship prize recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2015 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!participation to a summer school on management/creation of start-ups, discussion with IP and technology transfer service of IP and with Civic Drone about how to setup a start-up.<A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Pasteur_Paris/Entrepreneurshipt">(evidence)</A><FONT size="5pt" color="#0e6671">Applied Design</FONT>: Teams of art and design students with input from scientific advisors can use art to drive their iGEM projects, while also making scientific contributions. We are looking for projects that use art and design to consider and explore current and future implications of synthetic biology (including stakeholders, communication, pedagogy, thinking outwards).

ideation (brainstorming, debates, discussion, bibliography, creation) of effective traps and analysis kit. Imagination of functionalization of a patch to transform it into a detection device : design of a fusion protein, a biosilica cellulose composite nanomaterial, an immunological assay to detect viral antigens. Design of a trapping system, an analysis device, a simulation of a mapping application.<A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Pasteur_Paris/Design ">(evidence)</A><FONT size="5pt" color="#0e6671">Software tool</FONT>: Computers have been around for a long time. Why don't we have more, great software tools to help everyone engineer synthetic biological systems based on standard biological parts?
