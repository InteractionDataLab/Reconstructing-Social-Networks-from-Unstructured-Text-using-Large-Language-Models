Aim: To perform a Miniprep to isolate plasmid DNA of pET43.1a(+) with the inserts B1 col1, B1 col2 and C2 col1. The amplification method to increase the amount of plasmid is called Miniprep. Protocol: follow in this link What we did in the lab: Materials: • 50 ml Falcon tube • Shaking incubator (INFORS HT) • Swing bucket centrifuge (JOUAN GR41) • QIAGEN Miniprep kit • Microbiology equipment (type of incubator, Bunsen burner, water bath, etc… Follow this link) Method:The protocol in step 1 ask for spinning at 6000g but we can only achieve 3500 g so we used 3500 g for 8 minutes. We will follow most of the protocol of QIAGEN Miniprep 2016 except for a few modifications, which we describe, therefore, below. 1.Follow QIAGEN kit steps
Aim: To get back our insert from the Miniprep of our inserts with appropriate enzymes. We perform restriction enzyme digestion in order to recover our inserts. We choose appropriate restriction sites based on the host plasmid. Protocol: follow in this link What we did in the lab: Materials: • Restriction enzymes: XbaI, HindIII (New England Biolabs, NEB) • Restriction enzyme buffers • 37°C water bath • UV spectrophotometer Method: 1. Mix all the reagents and let digest during 2 hr at 37°C. Big volumes must be added first!Beginning of digestion 12h10.

Aim: To perform a Midiprep to isolate plasmid DNA of pET43.1a(+) with A1/A2/D1/D2 and B1/B2 for sequencing. Protocol: follow in this link : What we did in the lab: Materials: • 50 ml Falcon tube • Shaking incubator (INFORS HT) • Swing bucket centrifuge (JOUAN GR41) • QIAGEN Midiprep kit 2016 (QiaFilter, Cat No.ID: 28704) Method: The protocol in step 1 ask for spinning at 6000 g but we can only achieve 3500 g so we used 3500 g for 20 minutes. We will follow most of the protocol of QIAGEN Midiprep 2016 except for a few modifications, which we describe, therefore, below. 1. Use culture from overnight (17 hr) step on June 7, 2016 2. Pour culture in 50 ml Falcon nd centrifuge (15 min, 3500 g, 4°C) 3. Discard the supernatant (in biological waste) and add 4 ml of Buffer P1 (stored on ice) to the pellet 4. Add 4 ml of Buffer P2 (for cell lysis) and mix by inverting the Falcon a few times. Wait 5 min at 22°C (room temperature: RT, EU). Note: The color of the solution will change to blue. 5. Prepare syringes with their cap and the reservoir (on 50 ml Falcon) 6. Add 4 ml of Buffer P3 (for neutralization) to the Falcon and mix by inverting the tube a few times. Note: The color of the solution changes to white. 7. Pour the content of the Falcon in the syringes and let it sit for 10 min. In the meanwhile, equilibrate the provided columns with 4 ml of OBT (equilibration buffer) 8. Transfer the contents from the syringe to the column and wash with 2 X 10 ml of QC buffer 9. Prepare 10 tubes of 2 ml to aliquot pET43.1a(+) and pSB1C3.  Because we have only bench microfuges, we need to dispense our volume in smaller fractions. 10. Elution of DNA with 5 ml of QF and aliquot in 2 ml tubes 11. Centrifuge (30 min, 15000 g, room temperature) 12. Add 3.5 ml of isopropanol, mix to precipitate the DNA 13. Centrifuge (30 min, 15 000 g, at RT) 14. Remove isopropanol with pipet without taking DNA and place into chemical waste container 15. Add 1 ml of 70% ethanol, centrifuge again (15 min, 15 000 g, RT) and let air dry. 16. Resuspend in 50 µL of Tris 10 mM pH 8.0, EDTA, 1 mM (TE) and store at -20°C.
Aim: The previous purification shows a significant band at 30kDa for the samples 22 and 24 but also one at 70kDa. It probably left some NusA in our column so, it will be cleaned.br> Protocol: follow in this link What we did in the lab: Materials: • Fast Purification Liquid Chromatography • Chaotropic reagent (Guanidinium 6M) • EDTA 0,1M • PMSF (100mM) • Ni 2+ solution (100mM) • Centrifuge (labo deshmukh) Method: 1.

Put the column off the FPLC and wash it with 20 ml of milliQ water thanks to a fingerpit ans a syringue. 3. Add 20 ml of chaotropic reagent to denaturate the proteins fixed to the column 4. Wash the column with 20 ml of water 5. Add 10 ml of EDTA to clean it from nickel 6. Wash with 20 ml of water 7. Add 5ml of Ni solution to charge the column. The column turns green. 8. Wash with 20 ml of water 9. Sonicate the sample three times one minute at 60%, wait 90 seconds between each sonication, Finally, the sample is 40 ml, add 40 &microL of PMSF to avoid protein denaturation. 10. Centrifuge 25 min at 16000 g (rotor JA 25.50) 11. Inject your sample in the FPLC 12. Get back several samples: • C= Crude extract : before centrigugation • P= Pellet • SN= Supernatant • F= Flow through (unfixed proteins) • W= Wash 5% of buffer B • Fractions (depending on the gradient)
Aim: Get the size of the protein purified thanks to FPLC in order to know if it is our protein What we did in the lab: Materials: Materials: • SDS-Page cuve • SDS-Page gel (BIORAD) • Protein migration buffer • Protein ladder • Laemmli 2X • Coomassie Blue • Microbiology equipment (Follow this link) Method: 1. In 9 1.5 ml eppendorf, put 20 µL of a sample and 20 µL of Laemmli 2X. 2. Place the gel into the cuve and fill it with migration buffer 3. Follow the next deposit table: • Protein ruler 8ul • Pellet • Supernatant • Wash • Flow through • Fraction 13 • Fraction 16 • Fraction 20 • Fraction 22 • Fraction 24 4. Launch the migration at 120V (start at 12h10 and stop at 14h10). 5. Wash the gel three times with distilled water during 5min. 6. Color the gel with Coomassie Blue diluted 1/5 during 30min. 7. Wash with distilled water for 5min then let wash 15min. Method: We notice a 30kDa band in the well 9 and 10 so we redo a gel with the fractions 21 to 25. Follow exactly the same protocol but with 30 &microL of DNA and 30 &microL of Laemmli 2X. Deposit table: - Protein ruler 8 µl - Fraction 19 - Fraction 20 - Fraction 21 - Fraction 22 - Fraction 23 - Fraction 24 - Fraction 25 - Fraction 26 - Fraction 27 We notice a 30kDa band in the fractions 19 to 21 that may correspond to our protein and a 70kDa band due to NusA in fractions 23 to 25.
