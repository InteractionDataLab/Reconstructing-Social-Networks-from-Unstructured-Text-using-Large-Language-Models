BBa_K2053000Â  (for Bronze medal): T. pseudonana silaffin kinase (tpSTK1)
Thalassiosira pseudonana silaffin kinase (tpSTK1) is a central BioBrick part. It was described as an efficient diatom silaffin-phosphorylating enzyme [1]. Since it was shown that phosphorylation of silaffins increased their biosilification activity [2], we hypothesized that phosphorylation of silica-binding peptide from our fusion protein would increase its biosilification properties. To facilitate protein purification, we added a HisTag. To remove the HisTag, we separated the HisTag from the sequence by the TEV cleavage site sequence.
BBa_K2053002 (for Silver medal) : Fusion Si4-cellulose-binding domain-B domain protein A
In order to functionalize a cellulose-based patch into a biodetection device we designed and created a fusion protein by assembling three parts: the phage displayed silica-binding peptide (Si4) [3],  the Clostridium cellulovorans cellulose-binding domain of cellulose-binding protein A (CBPa) [4], and the B domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A (BpA) [5]. This fusion protein is used to bind to cellulose-based patch, increase its rigidity by biosilification, and make it a detection device by fixing Fc fragment of specific antibodies. We used preexisting iGEM BioBrick parts that we assembled thanks to commonly used flexible linkers [6]. To facilitate protein purification, we added a HisTag. To remove the HisTag, we separated the HisTag from the sequence by the TEV cleavage site sequence.
Fusion cellulose-binding domain of CBP-B domain of protein A (for Gold medal)
We improved previously existing BBa_K863110 and BBa_K103003 BioBricks parts by combining them, creating one part. It is a fusion protein between the Clostridium cellulovorans cellulose-binding domain of cellulose-binding protein A (CBPa) with the B domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A (BpA). This fusion protein can be used to bind antibodies to cellulose. To facilitate protein purification, we added a HisTag. To remove the HisTag, we separated the HisTag from the sequence by the TEV cleavage site sequence.
