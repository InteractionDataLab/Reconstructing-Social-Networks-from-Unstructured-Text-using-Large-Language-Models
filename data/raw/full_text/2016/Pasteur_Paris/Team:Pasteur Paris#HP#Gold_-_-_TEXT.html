Professional advice from:
We had professional advices from experts in different field in order to make our project both realistic and in line with issues found in the field. We obtained details about mosquitoes behavior and control,  and help for designing our detection system. We discuss with a company to explore several strategies for trap deposit. Open Science and Intellectual property issues have been debated with an expert specialized in the field. We meet: - Dr. Grégory Lambert, Mediterranean Interdepartmental board for the control of mosquito (Entente Interdépartementale de Démoustication de la Méditerranée, EID): information about methods currently used for testing endemic areas and the potential need of our kind of traps for places such as airports and hospitals. - Dr Anna-Bella Failloux (entomologist, head of Arboviruses and Insect Vectors (AIV) research unit in the department of virology at Institut Pasteur): details about the mosquito ecology and behavior during feeding. - Dr. Jean Claude Manuguerra (Emergency biological hazard response Team (CIBU), Institut Pasteur): exchange of information about detection methods and IP. - Dr. Jessica Vanhomwegen, (virologist at Institut Pasteur, Head of Viral identification (CIBU)): help with the immunological assay design. - M. Guilhot-Gauddefroy, CEO Civic Drone company:  strategies for remote deposition of our trap using drones and advice on opening a start-up company. - Mr. Keller, IP Lawyer, from "La Paillasse": invited for interactive Talk on Open Science and Intellectual property law. - Dr. Claudia Riegel, of the NOLA (City of New Orleans, Lousiana, US) Mosquito Control Board: negotiations about potential use of our trap in the Lousiana state, and in Brazil, including the possibility of applying for funding from the NOLA MCB.

Collaboration with the Rathenau Instituut
We also engaged into an active collaboration with the Rathenau Instituut, Holland, after winning the iGEM Synenergene prize about our scenarios. We had already a strong working scenario when we started our discussions, and it was an additional stratum to ours, to take into account the extra specifications of Zoe Robaey of the Rathenau Instituut.
