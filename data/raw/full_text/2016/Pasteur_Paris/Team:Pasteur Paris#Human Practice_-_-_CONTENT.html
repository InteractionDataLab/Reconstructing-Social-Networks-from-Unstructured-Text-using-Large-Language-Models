This is a debate practice or round table where several synthetic biology processes are made available to a few villages, and the inhabitants have to decide for the pros and cons of acquiring them, considering environmental, economical, and health benefits. Our role was to advise the players during the game, and then to have a little debate about synthetic biology and the ethical and moral questions it raises. We also addressed the “legal” aspect as viewed from the point of view of French and US Law. </P></DIV></ARTICLE><ARTICLE><DIV class="inner"><SPAN class="date"><SPAN class="day">28<SUP>th</SUP></SPAN><SPAN class="month">June</SPAN><SPAN class="year">2016</SPAN></SPAN><H2>Meeting with Anna-Bella Falloux</H2><P>We met <B>Anna-Bella Failloux</B> (entomologist, head of Arboviruses and Insect Vectors (AIV) research unit in the department of virology at Institut Pasteur) to have detailed information on mosquito ecology/habitat (types:aedes, culex) and behavior during feeding sorties(anthropophily, hematophagy).</P></DIV></ARTICLE><ARTICLE><DIV class="inner"><SPAN class="date"><SPAN class="month">JulyOcto</SPAN><SPAN class="year">2016</SPAN></SPAN><H2> Ratheneau Institut</H2><P>The Ratheneau Institut is in cooperation with Synenergene, there aim is to foster an open dialogue on ethical research and innovation in synthetic biology. The Ratheneau Institut want to raising awareness of science and technology among public opinion and politicians. To do so they organize debates and conferences about science and technology. 

Since July, the Ratheneau Institut helped us to develop our project by guiding us on the steps for our scenarios.

This organization is in charge of the fight against mosquito epidemics, which is recognized as a mission of public interest, for the Ministry of Health in France. Therefore EID is acting by delegation of authority, in a similar level as the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in the US.

Our interview with <B>Gregory Lambert</B> (medical entomologist, coordinator of EID) has allowed us to have more information on mosquito behavior: •Questions such as: How to lure them into the traps? •What are the strategic areas to place our kit?•How to optimize prevention? All these details have allowed us to work in a more targeted way, so that our project is as efficient as possible, taking into account the mosquito lifestyle and optimizing safety for surrounding populations.
