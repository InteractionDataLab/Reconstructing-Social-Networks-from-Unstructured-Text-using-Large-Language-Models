SCENARIO
Introduction text: Several steps have enabled us to shape final Moskit(o) devices. This part is about what we call in design the project approach. Initially, we developed different user scenarios to identify each actor and component of the project (by the way, we won the Synenergene call for projects with scenarios!). Then, we defined the visual identity of the Moskit(o) project. Finally, the first sketches came and 3D modeling followed. They were the outcome of multiple discussions with scientists, including Dr. Anna-Bella Failloux, an entomologist, in order to best adapt the form to the function.  The final step was the conception of prototypes. We will gladly walk you through these steps on this page, enjoy your reading!

These applications scenarios have allowed us to create the Moskit(o) project. They were validated by Synenergene, a Rathenau’s Institute program (learn more here). Concretely, it’s about answering questions related to our project : security-related impacts, ethics, regulations, technical requirements and especially its use. Indeed, these scenarios have been made in parallel to the development of the science protocols, which strengthened and fed as much the science part, as the design part. We have carried out extensive studies of different contexts to identify actors of the Moskit(o) project, from the manufacturer to the user. The conclusions we made enabled us to enrich our project and make it viable in the near future. All these illustrated scenarios have served many discussions with different specialists we met, but also among members of our team.

A kit is provided to local administrations in order to proceed to the trapping of mosquitoes and the detection test. Several devices compose this kit : •- Mosquito Traps to be displayed in the environment, in discussion with scientists &bull- For less accessible areas, a drone could be provided to display and take back the trap. &bull- A pack of biofabricated patches for testing mosquito blood &bull- A safe detection kit to carry out the analysis &bull- lysate and rinsing solutions stored in small containers.

Reservists are regular citizens who wants to get involved in the project. Once they are selected through an interview, they receive a small training teaching them how to manipulate and set the traps. In case of emergency or high risk of epidemy, they can be called upon by the local administrator to reinforce the surveillance and help depositing the traps. As the trapping system is very secure, the reservists are never endangered by these operations.

Mapping System scenario: Once the analysis is done, the results are entered in a database that automatically generates a mapping of the results. It allows a clear visualization of the locations of infected mosquitoes. The website is composed of a public area where everybody can consult the maps and be given prevention advice. The other part is accessible only with a personal account by the local administrators to enter the results and communicate with collaborators, to ensure data security Feedback: The database is also accessible to scientific experts. In this way, they help and advise local administrators in charge of the Mos(kit)o program. They can also use these data for fundamental research.

One of our final scenario
VISUAL IDENTITY
• • •
We wanted to give a strong identity to the Mos(kit)o project since the beginning. The idea was to find an evocative logo and create a coherent graphic charter for all communication media (poster, business card, wiki, flyers, exhibition cartels, sweat shirts…) but also in the objects embedded in the project.
SKETCHES
• • •
Here is an overview of our first sketches. This is the research step, where we explored several ideas to find the best technical solutions for each object. Hand sketches also allowed us to better communicate between the team members to edit or validate technical and formal research.
3D MODELING
Your browser does not support the video tag.
The 3D modeling allowed us to visualize volumes, dimensions and also the materials of our devices. This step is very important because it has allowed us to make choices on the industrial approach of production, to anticipate the price of the Mos(kit)o device. We compare the functional principles to the formal choices and improved the initial drawings. Here is an overview the trap modeling (on Rhinoceros software) and the analysis kit modeling (on Solidworks software).
• • • •
Following the technical and shape validation on the 3D modeling, we made renderings (Keyshot software). They allowed us to define aesthetic characteristics such as colors, surface aspects and other details related to the visual identity of Mos(kit)o. It was the latest digital validation step before starting to build a prototype.
3D PROTOTYPING
• • •
As designer students, we have at our disposal various workshops and prototyping machines such as laser cutter, plotters, 3D printers… These essential tools allow us to quickly test our project ideas, and to get quick feedbacks to adapt our designs. Here, we used two different 3D printers : an « Ultimaker 2 » and a «Zortrax ». We printed the different parts of our devices in PLA and ABS, in a 60 µm definition.
• • •
When the device parts are printed, the job isn’t finished yet! To get a more realistic result, we sanded several times the objects, then put a layer of primer and finally painted them. We chose to affix the Mos(kit)o logo and some legal information linked to safety (such as a serial number, or a caution sentence) through the film transfer technique. Finally, we created videos on the assembly of the trap and the user guide for the analysis station as instructions for users (Cinema 4D software).
