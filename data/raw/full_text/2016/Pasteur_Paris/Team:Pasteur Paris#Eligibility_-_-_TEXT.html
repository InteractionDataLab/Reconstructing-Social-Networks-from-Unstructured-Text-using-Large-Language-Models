Eligibility
Our project led us to conceive an innovative cellulose-based biodetection system. To achieve this goal, we have constructed an unprecedented bioBrick, which is quite essential in the igem competition ! Also, one of the specificity of our team is our three clever lawyers spectialized in Intellectual Property Law : they made a very precise report on the issues of open source science and shared that valuable knowledge with other teams during a meet-up that our team co-organized. They also invited an Intellectual property professional from "La paillasse" to assist them in that task. In this part of the wiki you can find out precisely what we did to make our project stand out, and win medals according to the iGEM criterias. In addition to that, a consquent part of our work makes our team eligible to special prizes, such as intagrated human practice ou applied design. Our plan for the Judging form: Click here. 1.
