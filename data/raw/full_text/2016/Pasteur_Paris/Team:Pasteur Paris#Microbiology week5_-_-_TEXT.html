Results:
Figure 7 : Digestion gel of pET43.1(a+)
We saw that in the line of the plasmid cut by XbaI and HindIII, we have two bands which don’t correspond to the uncut plasmid band. Moreover, The band of the plasmid cut by XbaI and HindIII have the appropriate weight. So we can cuclude that the digestion has worked. We can get back our plasmid cut with extraction gel.
Aim:
To recover the pET43.1a(+) which has been digested, and to purify out the band from the gel.

Results:
MpET43.1 = 5 300 bp * 660 g.mol-1.bp-1 MpET43.1 = 3.5*10-6 g/mol After condensation, we lost 5 299 molecules of water (one between each bp), so we have 0.1*106 g/mol Finally, we have : MpET43.1 = 3.4*106 g/mol Minsert = 5.6*105 g/mol According to the instruction: - We have 0.12 µmol/L in 20 µl, and we must have 10 pg to have a good yield in colonies. - Finally, we have 0.12 * 20*10-6 = 2.4*10-6 µmol of plasmid and 8.16 pg of plasmid.
Aim:
To make stock cells containing the plasmids, we need to enter the plasmid with C1 and C2 insert into the bacteria DH5 competent cells.
Protocol:
follow in this link
What we did in the lab:
Materials:
• Competent cells
• SOC media
•42°C waterbath
•LB/carbenicillin 50 µg/ml.
Method:
1- In five 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes, we put 40 µl of DH5 competent cells and we add 5µl of : (vector:Insert) ratio (1) (1:0) empty plasmid (2) C1 (1:1) (3) C1 (1:3) (4) C2 (1:1) (5) C2 (1:3) 2-   Place the tubes on ice during 30 min (6:30PM). 3-   Put them at 42 °C during 40 sec. 4-  Put them on ice during 2 min 30 sec. 5-  Add 200 µl of SOC in each tubes and place them in a shaking incubator for 1 h at 37°C and at 225 RPM. 6-  We spread our mix (250 µl) on petri dishes made of LB and carbenicillin. 7-  Put them at 37 °C for one night.
Only two colonies have grown on the plate C2 (1:3), all the other petri dishes are empty. According to the electrophoresis gel, the ligation has worked for C1 (1:3) and C2 (1:1) but it do not correspond to our results. We decided to pool C2 (1:1) with C2 (1:3) and C1 (1:1) with C1 (1:3) because the gel shows the same efficiency of ligation, in order to have more DNA for transformation.
Aim:
We want to increase the number of bacteria to check if they have the right plasmid. As we have two colonies, therefore we placed them to grow in liquid media in two Falcons.
Protocol:
follow in this link
What we did in the lab:
Method:
In a 50 ml Falcon : - Put 10 ml of LB and 5 µl of carbenicillin at 100 mg/ml. - Add the colony we took with a tooth-pick. - Put the Falcon in a shaking incubator at 37 °C for one day.
The ligation does not work well, so we pooled our ligation products to increase the amount of available DNA.
Aim:
At this stage, we want to obtain a ligated vector (pET43.1a(+) + C1/C2)
Protocol:
follow in this link
What we did in the lab:

Results:
After the elctrophoresis, we notice that the recombinating plasmid seems to contain two inserts. Indeed, the band corresponds to a size between 1 00 and 1 500 bp. We decided to digest our double insert with XbaI and SpeI to split it. We also digested a pET43.1with XbaI and SpeI to fit it.
Aim:<:
We observed that two inserts were present in our gels, we therefore want to verify that the second heavier one is not as a result  illegitimate ligation of XbaI/HindIII. There is a SpeI site in the neighboring sequences. Therefore, we want to split the insert to have just one insert.

Results:
The digestion does not work, we did not succeed in splitting the twinned insert so we decided to keep it and to express the protein with the double insert, hoping that the stop codon at the end of one of the inserts will be ennough. We will also sequence the plasmid to verify the orientation, and validity of our twinned insert hypothesis.
Aim:
In this part we wantant to proceed with the expression of our fusion protein containing the R5-CBD-BPA. To do this we need a cell line having a T7 RNA polymerase. The cells we chose were BL21De3 pLys S. These contain the T7 phage producing the T7 RNA polymerase, and lysozyme, which will inhibit the T7 RNA polymrase and help control the expression better in case our protein is toxic to the cells, and secondly in case the cells escape our control they will not be able to survive in nature, as they will lyse over time.
Protocol:
follow in this link
What we did in the lab:
Materials:
• BL21De3 competent cells
• SOC media
• 42 °C waterbath.
Method:
(I) : 50 µl of bacteria + 5 µl of pET43.1-C2 1.1 (II) : 50 µl of bacteria + 5 µl of pET43.1-C2 1.2 (III) : 50 µl of bacteria + 5 µl of pUC (IV) : 50 µl of bacteria + 5 µl of CT (plasmid given with the bacteria) After heat shock at 42°C, the cells were allowed to recover by growing at 37°C for 40 minutes in 150 µl of SOC, then the 200 µl of each sample were spread on a petridish with carbenicillin and grown at 37 °C for one night.
