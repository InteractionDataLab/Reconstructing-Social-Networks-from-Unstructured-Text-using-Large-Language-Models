Our team
Our team brings together 19 students from different fields of study : law, design, biology, chemistry, and physics … It is this multidisciplinary approach that allows us today to discuss the various aspects of this project and to complete it successfully.
We come from different institutions:: Pierre et Marie Curie University , Paris Diderot University , Paris Sud , ESPCI , ETSL and ENSCI . And we are lucky to be mentored by our three tutors : Deshmukh Gopaul, Patsy Polston and Vincent Le Gros.
The multidisciplinarity of our group give us also the opportunity to constantly learn from each other, wether in biology, chemistry, physics, but also in design and law. Being able to conduct our laboratory experiments for our own research is a real achievement for us. IGEM is a great adventure in which we can deepen our knowledge and acquire new skills.
But don't take us too seriously, we still know how to have some fun!!!!
Benoit BELIARD
He is a 2nd year student au ESPCI Paris. He did his prep class at St Geneviève School in Versailles. Benoit is crazy about judo and science, that’s why he has got a black belt of minipreps! He comes from Toulon and knows perfectly the ancestral way to distribute out Pastis shots, the typical alcohol of Southern France. He makes the team always have fun either in the lab or in the bar!
Hanifa BOUZIRI
After having her scientific high-school diploma, she began studying biology and chemistry at Pierre et Marie Curie University. She obtained her Bachelor’s Degree and, she is starting her Master 1 studies in Public Health at Paris Saclay University. The smile and the happiness of Hanifa punctuated our iGEM days! Whether hardworking on the wiki or manipulate in the lab, you can hear her laughs and stories far away (we concluded that she hates silence!). In addition to her scientific knowledge she is able to adapt and learn new skills quickly and effectively. Anyway, her perseverance also allowed her to improve her Photoshop skills (by producing scenes with our faces on Pokemons bodies).Be aware of the manipulations in the lab, in case she decides to transform our bacteria in Pikachu organisms. You got it, Hanifa is the perfect iGEM team member!
Marie CAMMAN
She has a scientific high-school diploma. She spent two years in Joffre high-school in prepa classes "Grandes Ecoles": the first year was in MPSI prepa and the second year was in PSI prepa. She is now in the second year of engineering school at ESPCI. The equivalent of a bachelor degree in maths, physics and chemistry. Marie is the perfect example of what a young modern woman should be. This intelligent and hard-working girl is always there in the lab, welcoming you with a warm smile and kindness. Her classy style and elegance make her the Grace Kelly of women in science. She is also our master of labock, always ready to write in the notebook conscientiously and methodically.
Lisa DEHOVE
After obtaining a scientific high school diploma, she had two years of preparatory class in applied arts. she is currently finishing a 4 years course at Ensci – Les Ateliers, an industrial design school. Lisa is a colourful person... quite literally. Indeed, she always wears very rainbow colored clothes, which sure brighten everyone's day. Her flat is covered with only two things: her drawings, and her plants (step on them and you are in big trouble!). Lisa is always up for good laughs, but she can also be a very calm and serious girl, which I believe makes her the perfect iGEM team member. Finally, her patience will always surprise us, especially when she has to help biologist, chemists and lawer students, with doing ridiculously basic things on the Adobe suite (she must be a Jedi or something!).
Audrey DELOT
After getting her school-leaving certificate, she did a Bachelor of Biology and Chemistry in Tours. During this time, she discovered her passion for chemistry and last year she joined the ESPCI in Paris. Audrey is a generous girl, enterprising and involved in the project design. Interesting element for the group, Audrey has conducted surveys in New Caledonia regarding the public about synthetic biology, and was ubiquitous at the beginning of the project. Shy and reserved, Audrey is tiny but has many scientific qualities!
Mélanie DUMAY
Mélanie obtained her scientific high school diploma. She wanted to work on cosmetics so she studied one year of chemistry at the University of science in Montpellier. This year she is in biophysics program, she obtained her BTEC National Diploma and she will start her first year of bachelor’s degrees in cosmetics products in the fall 2016. With her smile and her accent from the South of France, Mélanie brings a lot of fun in the lab during the late-night work. PCR master and serial bacteria lyser, she is hard-working and efficient.
Claudia GESTIN-VILION
She comes from Saint-Malo, France. She has studied law for 3 years in Rennes, Britany and specialized in IP law last year at Paris Sud university. She has lived in Canada for 6 months and in Germany for another 6 months in order to complete internships.

Charlène GUILLAUME
She is studying industrial design at ENSCI-Les Ateliers in Paris. Before this, she obtained a bachelor diploma of design at the « Ecole des Arts décoratifs» and a technical degree of product design. Charlene is a very nice person with a beautiful smile and good humour. She is always there when it comes to laughter between friends and making jokes. She loves the good “terroir” products and no shortage of bringing us artisanal sausages or good wine as soon as she can, YOUMIIIII.  She's also a very sweet person who can be serious and conscientious when it comes to work. She brings a great addition to our team by bringing a new vision and addressing aspects of the project to wider and original way. This is our little ray of sunshine.
Cindy HAMMAMOUCHE
The woman at a hundred degrees! After two years of hard preparation to the competition of engineering schools, she spent a year preparing a diploma as dietician-nutritionist in which the inactivity displeased her. So she raced to the laboratory, with permanent activity where she could run after the enzymes and equipment! So she goes into a company of more than 2000 m2 of pharmaceutical bottles. Cindy is a perfect Igemer !! She is verry joyfull , dynamic and funny girl . She was our first cool wiki teacher and She Was verry helpfull During the lab work . Her Enthusiasm , her good mood and her efficiency will allow to our team to advence in our project .
Mathieu HUBERT
After obtaining his scientific high-school diploma, he did a Biotec degree in Bioanalysis and Controls where he acquired several laboratory competencies. He wanted to dive into scientific research, and he flew to study in Paris in order to do training in biomedical research. Second of the class, his passion for virology grew and he integrated UPMC Master Molecular and Cellular Biology. He did the Master 2 Fundamental Virology of Institut Pasteur, where his knowledge about virology increased exponentially. Second of the class, he obtained a grant to fund his virology doctorate during the next 3 years. Mathieu is a person who seems very calm at first sight, but when you know him well, he is a very funny guy and we spend very pleasant time in his company. Between each laboratory experiment he doesn't hesitate to make jokes to lighten the mood. He just validated his master in virology brilliantly and he is very good at what he does. We can say without a doubt that he is of a great help in the lab and in the scientific design of our project.
Lise HUNAULT
After her high-school diploma mention Science in Labruyere school in Versaille. She spent 3 years in prep school in Henri IV. And now, she is in the second year of engineering school at ESPCI. Lise is one of our team member, from ESPCI, where she is studying physics and chemistry. She is also involved in her school association, with which she loves doing parties and playing volleyball! Above everything else, Lise is a really funny girl, who has a great sense of humour, who knows when to be serious, and who always bring happiness in the group.
Svetlana IVANOFF-COLLEU
She has a scientific high-school diploma, she spent two years in prep school for "Grandes Écoles" and she is now in the second year of engineering school at ESPCI. The equivalent of a bachelor degree in maths, physics and chemistry. Svetlana is a funny girl who knows how to work in the laboratory and who is not afraid when we have a lot of work to do. She has very good musical taste that was very useful to us when we stayed late nights in the lab. In brief, Svetlana is serious girl who knows when and how to have fun. She is the before Sis’!
Victoire LE CHEVALLIER
After having her scientific high-school diploma,  she turned in a double degree in law and economics. And now she is in Master 1 in digital and intellectual property law. This fan of harry potter, unconditional 9gag and buzzfeed has also toured the world and will share his travels with you. Beautiful tanned lawyer, she likes to decorate the skin of small tattoos felt. Come and meet Victory freshness will give you fishing!
Victor LEPINE
He was born and raised in Paris. He did 2 years of medical school before switching to law. And today he is in a Master degree in intellectual property. Victor first wanted to be a doctor, but then decided to use his great wit and eloquence to be a lawyer. He always has a joke on the tip of his tongue as well as a cigarette. Although he might talk a little bit too much during presentation sessions, his subtle and sophisticated humour is essential to our team - even Claudia would agree. He's never the last to party that's for sure. Oh, and did I mentioned he's so strong he couldn't help but break a petri dish with his bare hands the first time he helped in the lab ?
Mélanie LORIN
After having her high-school diploma in Biotech, she decided to continue her studies in a bachelor in Biotechnology. Her grades allowed her to persue her University diploma in biochemistry and biomolecules. And now she is in Master 2 in infectiology. Our little lab rat always with her white headband, ready for all the operations but be aware, she won’t be in before 1 pm. Shhh it's a secret!
Marina MALETIC
She finished high school in Belgrade, her hometown. She was in a ’bilingual’ class, which was oriented towards social sciences and literature. Some of her classes were half in Serbian, half in French, which helped her improve her French vocabulary. After graduation, she moved to Paris to begin studying life sciences at Pierre and Marie Curie University. This year, she obtained her Bachelor’s Degree and, in the fall, she is starting her Master studies in genetics at Paris Diderot University. Marina is Serbian gal, she is a hard-worker in the lab but always ready to go out for a drink. She is very kind and helpful since she is our serotonin girl!
Xavier MONTOY
He is studying industrial design at ENSCI-Les Ateliers in Paris. 5 things to love about Xavier: He is an awesome designer (he likes to make smelly wallets out of kombucha). He works out and is very athletic (but would definitely skip a session to go on a Pokemon hunt). He is a great artist and plays the piano (he also listens to PNL, so...). He is very careful about his diet and likes to eat healthy food (but will wash it down with 5 beers). And finally, he is an amazing person, and a great asset to have in an iGEM team (indeed, his spirit animal is the penguin...🐧)
Mehdi MOREL
He has a bachelor in Cellular Biology and physiology, and he’s currently in his last year of Master degree in Biochemistry of therapeutic and toxic molecules. The best way to describe Mehdi is to use one of his quote: "Mehdi is our god" Mehdi Morel, August 25, 2016. We really appreciate his humility. Beware, he also has a really mysterious sense of humour (try to not be offended!) and he is a master of language accents. He has also many skills in biology, some may say that he's a genius (his mother and him). So it's making him a really good asset in the laboratory! Big player of golf on his Wii console, he plays also soccer "sometimes". His favourite animal is the albinos dolphin!
Thomas VIALON
He did his high school in Saint-Céré, a small village in the French countryside, in the middle of fields and cows. Then, he studied physics, chemistry and mathematics at a university-level during two years of preparatory classes, in Toulouse, the birthplace of aviation. He is now in second year of ESPCI Paris, an engineering school and a research center in physics, chemistry and biology. Thomas is essential to the iGEM Pasteur team. He can solve a chemistry problem while flying an aircraft. If you meet him, you will probably hear his accent which comes from Toulouse in the south of France.
