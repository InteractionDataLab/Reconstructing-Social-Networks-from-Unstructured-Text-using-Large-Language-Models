1. We created a page with a clear (and fun) description of each member of our team in About us section. (evidence) 2. Safety (evidence) 3. The Attributions page, attribute work or conception contribution by students, and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs personnel, advisors, sponsors, and professional advice. (evidence) 4. We also created a sponsors page with description of our funding sources and their contribution to our project (evidence) 5. Our new BioBrick (the kinase) is central to our project. If you want more explanations, please go to the Parts section. (evidence)
1. We created a new BioBrick part (C2) which is our generated from own design and construction work as expected. (evidence) . 2. Collaboration: (evidence) - We organized with iGEM Paris Saclay team, the "Meet-up Ile-de-France" on August 6 2016 and we participated in the meet-up organized by IGEM IONIS and IGEM EVRY, "the European experience" in July 2 2016. (evidence) - We invited an Intellectual property professional from "La paillasse" in our meet-up to learn more about intellectual property and have more information on how can we create a new start-up in Synthetic Biology. - We established a collaboration with the IGEM TU Delft team, we helped them in their Bibliographic search on biosilica optical properties and also in their microbiology and protein chemistry Protocols for their labwork. - We made presentations about intellectual property to Institut Pasteur Professionals, and other Parisian Teams, and issued a workbook on this aspect of Open science. - Together with other iGEM teams we created a circle of questionnaire distribution in Synthetic Biology. (evidence) 3. Human practice: (evidence) - Ethics and safety: we followed safety training for general lab safety. We also learned how to handle nonhazardous organisms not exceeding level 2 (safety requirements BHSL 1/2, no manipulation of NSB 3 and 4 pathogens). GMOs were confined into the lab, and strict waste disposal protocols as established by Institut Pasteur. For the immunology part, mosquitoes used for experiments were not sampled from the environment, but from the Insectarium facility of Institut Pasteur, rated-as pathogen free, and we only handle a part of the viral protein which is not pathogenic. We complied with the safety requirements in the laboratories. (evidence) - Security: We had restricted access to our lab by Id badges.  We further, in the application part of our project, used symbols to determine the targeted pathogen by the patches to guarantee anonymity by experimenters.Institut Pasteur abides to strict security protocols at the National level for arboviruses, and is a reference center for the World Health Organization (WHO). - Sustainability: our patch is biodegradable, no expensive, ergonomic, which only needs a small amount material (mg), thus produces a minimum amount of waste. The trap is washable and reusable by following standard decontamination procedures established by the center for rapid intervention at Pasteur (CIBU). (evidence) - Social justice: Our trap and patch are easy to use, and is aimed at not being expensive, by having no motorized parts, requiring batteries or electricity. We thought about two kinds of application scenarios: for developed and developing countries in terms of infrastructure and cost. We also thought about education of young people coming from areas with different income. Thus we explained our the Mos(kit)o device, and educated about mosquitoes to both Parisian children (Collège Germaine de Staël, Mosquito chase game, Paris 15 arrondissement), and suburbs (“Jouer à Débattre”: Debate game on synthetic biology in Bobigny, Seine-St-Denis). (evidence) - Intellectual property rights: account of state of the art, no infrigement of IP laws. (evidence)
1. Human practice: (evidence) We had professional advice from: - Dr. Grégory Lambert, Mediterranean Interdepartmental board for the control of mosquito (Entente Interdépartementale de Démoustication de la Méditerranée, EID). - Dr Anna-Bella Falloux (entomologist, head of Arboviruses and Insect Vectors (AIV) research unit in the department of virology at Institut Pasteur). - Dr. Jean Claude Manuguerra (biological hazard rapid intervention Team, Institut Pasteur). - Dr. Jessica Vanhomwegen, virologist, design of the immunological assay. - M. Guilhot-Gauddefroy, CEO Civic Drone company, for the strategy of remote deposition of our trap. - Mr. Keller, IP Lawyer, from "La Paillasse" about Open Science and Intellectual property. - Dr. Claudia Riegel, of the NOLA (City of New Orleans, Lousiana, US) Mosquito Control Board, about the possible use of our trap in the Lousiana state, and in Brazil, including the possibility of applying for funding from the NOLA MCB. (evidence) We also engaged into an active collaboration with the Rathenau Instituut, Holland, after winning the iGEM Synenergene prize about our scenarios. We had already a strong working scenario when we started our discussions, and it was an additional stratum to ours, to take into account the extra specifications of Zoe Robaey of the Rathenau Instituut. (evidence) 2. Page parts (B2): we improved the characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part. (evidence)
