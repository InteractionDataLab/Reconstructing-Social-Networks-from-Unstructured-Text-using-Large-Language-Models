				EtOH does not dissolve the cellulose, H20 is the best solvent.→ The solutions below 10% are homogeneous,  but above 15% they  are not (it is too viscous).</DIV><DIV class="text1"><H2><B>May 26th, 2016:</B></H2></DIV><H4><STRONG>Spreading test solutions of cellulose  on different supports: </STRONG></H4><DIV class="text1"><P><U> Aim:</U>Determine the solid support on which the spreading of the cellulose solution is optimal in view of evaporation of the solvent. The cellulose based patch needs to be created out of the dissolved cellulose solutions; in order to do that the solvent needs to be evaporated by spreading the mix over a solid support.<U>Principle:</U>Spreading on media, qualitative evaluation of substrate wetting, and evaporation.<U>Manipulation:</U>Spread with a flat spatula and qualitative assessment of the dampening (flexibility of the constituted solid surface).</P><H4>With 3% solution:</H4>• with glass: very little grip, grainy materail that are not separated  by spreading.• with paper filter: moderately satisfactory result, good flow, good adhesion but the filter paper is soaked.• with aluminim: it spreads well in the beginning but dry very quickly and becomes granular in a few seconds.• with a PVC film: same as glass with less ease of spreading.<H4>With 1.25% solution:</H4>• with aluminum: a result slightly better but with holes that are always formed, the material dries.• with the filter paper: a result a little better, good flow.• with PVC: same.• with glasses: same.<U>Problem: </U>The glass and aluminum does not give quite satisfactory results.<H4>With the 5% solution:</H4>
				Same with the glass and aluminum → easier spreading at the beginning then more difficult because of the surface tension, but with a slower reaction because of the higher viscosity. 5% on normal paper: good texture after wetting, good flow, low drying.  The most effective materials are aluminum and the filter paper.

				Plate making test: spread then put in an oven at 50 °C:  Test plates:

				The solutions were spread through a calibrated wiper system to the surface is as flat as possible a layer. The plates are placed in an incubator 50 °C for 20 hours.  Another test has been performed: on a glass plate in a 10% solution that has been deposited on cotton and the plate is placed in an oven.<U>Results of drying in the oven:</U> Cellulose deposits are invisible on paper. Even scratching does not cause the cellulose grain to coming off. On aluminum, 10% solution of cellulose gave some stuck grains that couldn't be removed by scratching.<U>Conclusion:</U>The cellulose concentration is too low. 
				The deposit on cotton gave an unexpected result: the solution solidified into a flexible film. The surface is uneven and therefore of  little use for our patch. To try to obtain a homogeneous film, several other experiments are conducted.→ The 10% solution is placed between two glass plates and then placed in an oven→ Another plating on aluminum is done. To avoid the wetting phenomenon which makes the convex surface, the walls were made by inserting the foil in a rectangular mold. Two tests are performed:• The foil is filled with a 10% solution• The foil is filled with a 10% solution and some cotton fibers are added over the paper. If the result is a film, the planar surface would be one that is below (where there is no cotton fibers). These plates are dried in open air for 5 days as an oven is unavailable.
				<H4>Testing a mixture of solvent: water-ethanol.</H4><U>Aim :</U> Dissolving cellulose in a water-ethanol mixture to use the fact that these two species form  an azeotropic mixture.<H4>Evaporating the mixture, ethanol will leave more easily than water, which will increase the cellulose concentration in water and bring it to solidify.</H4>One must test x % EtOH that is less than 90%, such that more ethanol will evaporate, thus forcing the cellulose to solidify more. Two solutions are prepared:• xetOH =  50%• xetOH = 70%

				Unfortunately, these solutions do not dissolve cellulose. So the deposit appears to be too heterogeneous for sedimentation; it would result in basically unequal amounts of cellulose.<U>Conclusion: </U>the water-ethanol mixture behaves like the ethanol solution.</DIV><DIV class="text1"><H2><B>May 27th, 2016:</B></H2></DIV><H5><STRONG>Compression of the powder or a powder-water mixture to make the patch. </STRONG></H5><DIV class="text1"><P><U> Aim:</U>
			Produce a patch with pure cellulose powder to avoid the problem of too low concentration. After the difficulties with the water/EtOH_Cellulose mixtures, we decided to use pure cellulose in a compressed form.<U> Principle:</U>
			 Compress the powder to assess the surface produced by such method. The shape of the patch is given by a mold used in the pressor compartment.The powder is first compressed into a rectangular mold 1 mm thick at 200 bar and at room temperature. The result is quite satisfactory: a friable solid is obtained.  To harden the materiel obtained, the same experiment is conducted by adding a few drops of water on top. After compression, the powder was solidified in part and a few grainy bits remained. It is therefore necessary to mix water and the powder before compressing. A water-cellulose mixture is then prepared: 3.42 g of cellulose and 3 g of water.

			It gives a mixture of 53% cellulose. It has a paste like texture.  The compression plates have been heated beyond our control. We proceeded with cutting the shapes are by lack of time. The only powder is compressed into a mold in the form of 0.5 mm thick test piece. plate temperature is 90 °C. The result is the same, a brittle solid.  The mixture at 53 °C cellulose is then compressed at 80 °C in the same mold. A flexible and resistant film is obtained. It is a bit transparent.  The patches obtained are then immersed in water in order to simulate for the reaction of the patch to the incorporation of proteins and to the silification.

			We observed that after 1 minute 45 s, the patch from the cellulose-water mixture softens but doesn't disaggregate. It can be recovered in a solid form.  After 2 min, the patch from the cellulose only (without water)  powder curves but remains strong. 

			The patches are then allowed to dry in the open area.<U>Conclusion:</U> This method is suitable for manufacturing. It remains to determine how to incorporate protein and silica.</P></DIV><DIV class="text1"><H2><B>May 28th, 2016:</B></H2></DIV><H3><STRONG>Improvements </STRONG></H3><DIV class="text1"><P><U>  Aim:</U>  Improve cellulose patch and drying results.

The shape of the patch is given by a mold. <U> Manipulation:</U>• Preparation of a 75% paste, composed of 4.5 g of cellulose + 1.5 g of water → Paste A • Preparation of another pulp 75%, 4.5 g cellulose + 1.5 g of water → Paste B • Preparation of a pulp 65%, 3.9 g cellulose + 2.1 g of water → Paste C • Compression of the Paste A to 200 bar at room temperature (2 min). We obtained an opaque patch, some areas have dried, there is a good mechanical strength, not too brittle. • Compression of the Paste B to 200 bars at 70 ° C (2 min). We obtained a patch with interesting properties: it has intermediate mechanical properties, smooth, more rigid than that at 65% and 53%; however, it is somewhat brittle. • Compression of the Paste C to 200 bars at 70 ° C (2 min). A translucent patch is obtained, flexible, almost identical to Paste B. <U> Conclusion:</U>   The pulp at 75% cellulose seems to have given the most interesting result for its mechanical properties and its apparent homogeneity before and after immersion / drying.

				Washing the patch during several seconds is not enough to remove the color
				They are immersed in water for decoloration during 30 min. 
				We need to improve this method of estimation of the amount of protein bound.

This process works at room temperature  great! • Preparation of the same CMC patch with BSA/buffer 
				- dissolution of 3 mg of BSA in 0.9 g of Tris/HCl buffer 
				- mix with 2.1 g of CMC 
				- compression: 200 bars, RT, 4min (with BSA) (fig 2) → We got a patch with a good flexibility but it’s not very homogeneous • Preparation of an Avial patch : 70% RT, 4min, 200 bars, Avial (fig3) → We got a white opaque, brittle patch, easily crumbled • We tried to increase the temperature of the press to get the same patch with Avial as the one with CMC. 
				- Avial, 50°C, 4min 200 bars, 70% (fig5) 
				- Avial, 80°C, 200 bars, 70% (fig 6) → At 80°C, the patch is more solid. → We do not succeed in making a flexible and transparent patch, neither at 50°CC nor at 80°C, with CMC. 

				The stiffness of the patches increases as they dry (true for all the patches).
