WE ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO HELPED US IN OUR PROJECT!
We would like to thank the administration and support services at Institut Pasteur for hosting the iGEM Pasteur team, composed of students from several universities. We thank the professors and coaches of Institut Pasteur, Ecole supérieure de physique et chimie industrielles de la Ville de Paris (ESPCI PARIS), Ecole nationale supérieure de création industrielle (ENSCI)-Les Ateliers, University Jean Monnet Paris Saclay, University Paris Pierre et Marie Curie, University Paris Diderot, Ecole des techniques supérieures de Laboratoire (ETSL), for cooperating and advising us.
Professional advice: Professional advice: For their most precious professional advice, special thanks is given to:
• Dr Anna Bella Failloux (Entomologist, Head of Arboviruses and Insect Vectors (AIV) Research Unit in the Department of Virology at Institut Pasteur Paris) for her expertise that was instrumental in our project design, her support, and her advice as it pertains to all things mosquitoes!
• Mr. Edouard Guilhot-Gaudeffroy (CEO of Civic Drone) and his team of engineers for their willingness to discuss drone options and for their participation during our meet-up.
• EID Méditerranée (Entente Interdépartementale de Démoustication/Interdepartmental agreement for mosquito control on the Mediterranean coast): Dr. Gregory Lambert, (Medical Coordinator and Entomologist) for his expert advice on practical applications for our device, his long talks that informed our design, and for his willingness to continue working with us.
To learn more about them please visit the discussion part .
• CIBU (Cellule d’Intervention Biologique d’Urgence / Urgent Response to Biological Threats) at the Institut Pasteur: Dr. Jean-Claude Manuguerra supervises this unit and we had the opportunity to present our project in to the entire CIBU lab. This allowed us to exchange ideas about our method of detection, our global device, and the protection of our system through intellectual property, enabled by iGEM, during the Q & A session that followed our talk.
• Dr. Jessica Vanhomwegen, virologist, Head of the Viral identification of the CIBU: for her expertise in setting up the immunological assays for our patch. To learn more about these meetings, please visit the the Collaborations section! .
• Assistant professors at ESPCI Paris: Yvette Tran and Hélène Montès for helping us conceive and assemble the cellulose base of the patch.
Labwork and Other Support:
We want to thank Hervé Waxin, Director of the Teaching center, the Secretaries and our lab technicians from the Education Center of Institut Pasteur who helped us whenever we needed to complete our lab work. We couldn't have done it without you!
Our Amazing Coaches ! :
Dr. Deshmukh GOPAUL for heading every part of this project. He provided a significant amount of help in the lab (protein purification with FPLC (Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography) as we performed the chemistry and microbiological experiments. Vincent LEGROS for providing a significant amount of help with the immunologic assays and the microbiology experiments. Additionally, he supported us with our literature search, the questionnaires about synthetic biology, coached us for presentations, and provided his expertise in virology. Guillian GRAVES for providing a significant amount of support with the design students for the conception, prototyping, and 3D printing of the trap and detection device. He also coached us for our presentations. Dr. Patsy POLSTON for providing a significant amount of help and support with every part of human practice (i.e. application scenario, techno-moral scenario, communication, collaborations), fundraising, and for coaching us for presentations.
