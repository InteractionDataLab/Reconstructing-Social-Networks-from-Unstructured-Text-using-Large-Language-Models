   				 	Vincent is a veterinarian from Toulouse, but the animals he is interested in are very small... Indeed, he is now doing a PhD in Pasteur Institute on viruses tranmitted by mosquitoes! His aim is to decipher the role of joint cells into the pathology of chikungunya disease. To do that, he is taking advantage of both in vitro and in vivo model, using recombinant viruses to highlight unknown mecanisms.

					Benoit is crazy about judo and science, that’s why he has got a black belt of minipreps! He comes from Toulon and knows perfectly the ancestral way to distribute out Pastis shots, the typical alcohol of Southern France. He makes the team always have fun either in the lab or in the bar!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="column-layout2"><DIV class="Hanifa"><A id="Hanifa"><H3>Hanifa BOUZIRI</H3></A></DIV><DIV class="text2"><P>
    			After obtaining her scientific high-school diploma, she began studying biology and chemistry at Pierre et Marie Curie University. She obtained her Bachelor’s degree and, she is starting her Master 1 studies in Public Health at Paris Saclay University. 
				The smile and the joyfullness of Hanifa marked our iGEM days! Whether she is working hard on the wiki or experimenting in the lab, you can hear her laugh and stories from far away (we learned that she hated silence in the room!). In addition to her scientific knowledge, she is able to adapt and learn new skills quickly and effectively. Not only that, her perseverance also allowed her to improve her Photoshop skills (by creating scenes with our faces on Pokemon bodies). Beware of her experiments in the lab, she might decide to transform our bacteria into Pikachu organisms! You got it, Hanifa is the perfect iGEM team member!
    		</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="column-layout3"><DIV class="Marie"><A id="Marie"><H3>Marie CAMMAN</H3></A></DIV><DIV class="text3"><P>
    			She has a scientific high-school diploma. She spent two years in Joffre high-school in preparatory classes, &quot;Grandes Ecoles&quot;: the first year she was in MPSI (Maths-Physics, Science Engineering) and the second year she was in PSI prep. She is now in the second year of engineering school at ESPCI, which is the equivalent of a bachelor degree in maths, physics and chemistry. 
				Marie is the perfect example of what a young modern woman should be. This intelligent and hard-working girl is always there in the lab, welcoming you with a warm smile and kindness. Her classy style and elegance make her the Grace Kelly of women in science. She is also the trustworthy keeper of our lab-book.

    		After obtaining a scientific high school diploma, she spent two years in a preparatory class of applied arts. She is currently finishing her 4-year course at ENSCI – Les Ateliers (Ecole nationale superieure de creation industrielle), an industrial design school. 
			Lisa is a colorful person...quite literally! Indeed, she always wears very rainbow-color clothes, which surely brightens everyone's day. Her apartment is covered with two things only: her drawings and her plants (step on them and you are in big trouble!). Lisa is always up for a good laugh, but she can also be very calm and serious, which we believe makes her the perfect iGEM team member. Lastly, her patience will always surprise us, especially when she has to help biologists, chemists and law students, with doing ridiculously basic things on the Adobe suite (she must be a Jedi or something!).

    		The woman at a hundred degrees! After two years of hard preparation for the competition of engineering schools, she spent a year preparing a diploma to be a dietician-nutritionist, but she didn’t like the passivity that came with it. So she raced to the laboratory, where it was more dynamic and where she could run around enzymes and equipment! She will go to a company of more than 2000 m2 of pharmaceutical bottles! 
			Cindy is a perfect IGEMer !! She is a very joyful, dynamic, and funny girl . She was our first cool wiki teacher and she was very helpful during the lab work. Her enthusiasm, good mood, and efficiency allowed our team to advance our project.

				5 things to love about Xavier: He is an awesome designer (he likes to make smelly wallets out of kombucha). He works out and is very athletic (but would definitely skip a session to go on a Pokemon hunt). He is a great artist and plays the piano (he also listens to PNL, so...). He is very careful about his diet and likes to eat healthy food (but will wash it down with 5 beers!). And finally, he is an amazing person, and a great asset to have in an iGEM team (indeed, his spirit animal is the penguin...)

   			 	He has a bachelor in Cellular Biology and physiology, and he’s currently in his last year of Master degree in Biochemistry of therapeutic and toxic molecules.
				The best way to describe Mehdi is to use one of his quote: &quot;Mehdi is our god&quot; Mehdi Morel, August 25, 2016! We really appreciate his humility. Beware, he also has a really mysterious sense of humor (try to not be offended!) and he is a master of language accents. He has also many skills in biology, some may say that he's a genius (his mother and him!). So it's making him a really good asset in the laboratory! Big player of golf on his Wii console, he plays also soccer &quot;sometimes&quot;. His favorite animal is the albinos dolphin!
