• We created a page with a clear (and fun) description of each member of our team in About us section. (evidence) • The Attributions page, attribute work or conception contribution by students, and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs personnel, advisors, sponsors, and professional advice. (evidence) • We also created a sponsors page with description of our funding sources and their contribution to our project (evidence) • Our new BioBrick (the kinase) is central to our project. If you want more explanations, please go to the Parts section. (evidence)
•We created a new BioBrick part (C2) which is our generated from own design and construction work as expected. (evidence) . • Collaboration: (evidence) - We organized with iGEM Paris Saclay team, the "Meet-up Ile-de-France" on August 6 2016 and we participated in the meet-up organized by IGEM IONIS and IGEM EVRY, "the European experience" in July 2 2016. (evidence) - We invited an Intellectual property professional from "La paillasse" in our meet-up to learn more about intellectual property and have more information on how can we create a new start-up in Synthetic Biology. - We established a collaboration with the IGEM TU Delft team, we helped them in their Bibliographic search on biosilica optical properties and also in their microbiology and protein chemistry Protocols for their labwork. - We made a presentations about intellectual property to Pasteur Institute Professionals, and other Parisian Teams, and issued a workbook on this aspect of Open science. - Together with other iGEM teams we created a circle of questionnaire distribution in Synthetic Biology.(evidence) • Human practice: (evidence) - Ethics and safety: we followed safety training for general lab safety. We also learned how to handle nonhazardous organisms not exceeding level 2 (safety requirements BHSL 1/2, no manipulation of NSB 3 and 4 pathogens). GMOs were confined into the lab, and strict waste disposal protocols as established by Institut Pasteur. For the immunology part, mosquitoes used for experiments were not sampled from the environment, but from the Insectarium facility of Institut Pasteur, rated-as pathogen free, and we only handle a part of the viral protein which is not pathogenic. We complied with the safety requirements in the laboratories (evidence) - Security: We restricted access to our lab by Id badges.  We further, in the application part of our project, used symbols to determine the targeted pathogen by the patches to guarantee anonymity by experimenters. Institut Pasteur abides to strict security protocols at the National level for arboviruses, and is a reference center for the World Health Organization (WHO).                - Sustainability: our patch is biodegradable, no expensive, ergonomic, which only needs a small amount material (mg), thus produces a minimum amount of waste. The trap is washable and reusable by following standard decontamination procedures established by the center for rapid intervention at Pasteur (CIBU) - Social justice: Our trap and patch are easy to use, and is aimed at not being expensive, by having no motorized parts, requiring batteries or electricity. We thought about two kinds of application scenarios: for developed and developing countries in terms of infrastructure and cost. We also thought about education of young people coming from areas with different income. Thus we explained our the Mos(kit)o device, and educated about mosquitoes to both Parisian children (Collège Germaine de Staël, Mosquito chase game, Paris 15 arrondissement), and suburbs (“Jouer à Débattre”:Debate game on synthetic biology in Bobigny, Seine-St-Denis) - Intellectual property rights: account of state of the art, no infrigement of IP laws
• Page parts (B2): we improved the characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part (evidence) • Human practice: (evidence) We had professional advice from: - Dr. Grégory Lambert, Mediterranean Interdepartmental board for the control of mosquito (Entente Interdépartementale de Démoustication de la Méditerranée, EID). - Dr Anna-Bella Falloux (entomologist, head of Arboviruses and Insect Vectors (AIV) research unit >in the department of virology at Institut Pasteur). - Dr. Jean Claude Manuguerra (Biological hazard rapid intervention Team, Institut Pasteur). - Dr. Jessica Vanhomwegen, virologist, design of the immunological assay. - M. Guilhot-Gauddefroy, CEO Civic Drone company, for the strategy of remote deposition of our trap. - Mr. Keller, IP Lawyer, from "La Paillasse" about Open Science and Intellectual property. - Dr. Claudia Riegel, of the NOLA (City of New Orleans, Lousiana, US) Mosquito Control Board, about the possible use of our trap in the Lousiana state, and in Brazil, including the possibility of applying for funding from the NOLA MCB (evidence) We also engaged into an active collaboration with the Rathenau Instituut, Holland, after winning the iGEM Synenergene prize about our scenarios. We had already a strong working scenario when we started our discussions, and it was an additional stratum to ours, to take into account the extra specifications of Zoe Robaey of the Rathenau Instituut.

Integrated Human Practice: We took into account every aspect of human practice into our project, firstly, we integrated HP into the work by backing up every scientific research and lab experiments with an upstream human practice study. In addition to that, we have been careful to thoughtfully implement our work in the actual context, to make sure it addresses current concerns of our society. In the process, we were careful not to skip any step and to develop our project in a didactic manner, that hopefully can be built upon by others (all of our research and methods can be found in the wiki). Finally, we spread the word about our team and our project as much as possible, and we got very positive feedback (from school pupils, high school students, scientists and the general public, and hopefully our project and our team has inspired some of them. (evidence) Education and Public engagement:Our team focused a great part of the work on education and public engagement, in an attempt to reach the most various public possible starting with middle school and high school students, through game-like activities followed by animated debats. Then moving on to a more informed audience during conferences and scientific events (such as the Zika summit and the “Festival Vivant” where we presented our project in front of the public, generating a constructive discussion. And finally, we did our best at sparking the public’s interest by reaching out to them through polls, both online and on the street. We would like to believe these exchanges resulted in a win-win situation, since both our team and the public learnt a lot from these interactions. (evidence) Entrepreneurship: The cross-track entrepreneurship prize recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2015 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges! participation to a summer school on management/creation of start-ups, discussion with IP and technology transfer service of IP and with Civic Drone about how to setup a start-up. (evidence) Applied Design: Teams of art and design students with input from scientific advisors can use art to drive their iGEM projects, while also making scientific contributions. We are looking for projects that use art and design to consider and explore current and future implications of synthetic biology (including stakeholders, communication, pedagogy, thinking outwards). ideation (brainstorming, debates, discussion, bibliography, creation) of effective traps and analysis kit. Imagination of functionalization of a patch to transform it into a detection device : design of a fusion protein, a biosilica cellulose composite nanomaterial, an immunological assay to detect viral antigens. Design of a trapping system, an analysis device, a simulation of a mapping application. (evidence) Software tool: Computers have been around for a long time. Why don't we have more, great software tools to help everyone engineer synthetic biological systems based on standard biological parts? creation of a user interface to report data and access to data base.
