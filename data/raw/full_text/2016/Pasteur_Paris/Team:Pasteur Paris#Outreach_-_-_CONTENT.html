Then, we corrected the test and gave them a little “crash course” on the topic of mosquitoes and arboviruses to prepare them for the afternoon game.</FONT></P><P style="text-align:justify"><FONT size="4pt">In the afternoon, we organized 2 activities: first, we had the students, in groups of 4, design a mosquito trap and think of how it would be placed and hidden in the environment. The students were extremely creative and had very original ideas like making a chicken-shaped trap in order for it to easily blend into the environment!</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3pt">They presented their projects in front of the rest of the class and then: game time!</FONT></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="sidebar2"><P style="text-align:justify"><FONT size="3pt">The rules of the game were the following : the students were given a list of 10 geographical zones including swamp, city, desert, house, etc. Based on the presentation they received in the morning, they had to pick 4 of these zones where they thought they were the most likely to find mosquitoes.</FONT></P><P style="text-align:justify"><FONT size="3pt">The winning team was the one that made the best prognostics on infested zones and found the most mosquitoes!</FONT></P><P style="text-align:justify"><FONT size="3pt">To determine the results of the game, we went to the playground, where boards representing every zone had been placed. Each “zone” contained pieces of information about the zone, explaining why it was inhabited or not by mosquitoes. Each board had mosquito traps attached to it.</FONT></P><P><CENTER><FONT size="3pt"> Each team had to pick one trap in each of the zone previously selected.</FONT></CENTER></P></DIV><DIV class="sidebar3"><P style="text-align:justify"><FONT size="3pt">Then we went back to the classroom where the students opened the traps and counted the number of mosquitoes inside.

It’s purpose is to educate them about arboviruses, and to make them understand that being able to locate mosquitoes upstream will enable a more efficient fight against arboviruses.

Our role was to advise the players during the game, and then, to have a little debate about synthetic biology and the ethical and moral questions it raises.</FONT></P><DIV class="flexbox-container"><DIV><H3>1) The game</H3><P style="text-align:justify"><FONT size="3pt">The « jeu à débattre » was a simulation game about synthetic biology issues. The students were divided into 5 smaller little groups that each represent a town. Each town starts off with the same number of health, wealth, and environment points.
</FONT></P><P style="text-align:justify"><FONT size="3pt">Then, a series of 5 innovations (all created with synbio) was proposed to every town. The students in each group, representing the citizens of the town, had to decide whether or not they wanted to implement the innovation. The innovations proposed often had a positive economic and/or immediate environmental impact, while being dangerous for public health or the environment in the long term.</FONT></P><P style="text-align:justify"><FONT size="3pt">After each innovation was proposed and the students debated about them for 10 minutes, they voted on whether to adopt it or not. After each round, the game leader told the groups the outcome of their decisions, whether it had a positive or negative impact on health, employment, economy, by removing or adding points to their town score.
</FONT></P><P style="text-align:justify"><FONT size="3pt">The winning team was the one with the most points in health, environment and wealth at the end of the game.</FONT></P></DIV><DIV><H3>2) The debate</H3><P style="text-align:justify"><FONT size="3pt">First, we described our project to the high school students.</FONT></P><P style="text-align:justify"><FONT size="3pt">Then, the iGEM Pasteur team had a very interesting debate with the students and teachers. They asked questions about:- Safety issues- Long term effects of synthetic biology- The economic aspect of our project- How the patch works- The modification of the human genome, whether or not it was possible and allowed- The protection of biotechnological inventions by patent law</FONT></P><P style="text-align:justify"><FONT size="3pt">The outcome of the day was very positive and the association is willing to collaborate with us again.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV><P style="text-align:justify"><CENTER><FONT size="3pt">If you want to find out more about the association</FONT></CENTER></P></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
