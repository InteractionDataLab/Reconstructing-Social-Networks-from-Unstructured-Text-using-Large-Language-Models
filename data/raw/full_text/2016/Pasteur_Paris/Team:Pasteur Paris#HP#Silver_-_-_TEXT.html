Safety & Security:
Ethics and safety: Human Practice had a special place in our project. Throughout its development, we carefully took into account and expand several aspects of Human Practice. Safety and security were the first element we handle, because of specific risks that a work in wet lab involved. We followed safety training for general lab safety. We also learned how to handle nonhazardous organisms not exceeding level 2 (safety requirements BHSL 1/2, no manipulation of NSB 3 and 4 pathogens). GMOs were confined into the lab, and strict waste disposal protocols as established by Institut Pasteur. For the immunology part, mosquitoes used for experiments were not sampled from the environment, but from the Insectarium facility of Institut Pasteur, rated-as pathogen free, and we only handle a part of the viral protein which is not pathogenic. We complied with the safety requirements in the laboratories (evidence) Security: We restricted access to our lab by Id badges. We further, in the application part of our project, used symbols to determine the targeted pathogen by the patches to guarantee anonymity by experimenters . Institut Pasteur abides to strict security protocols at the National level for arboviruses, and is a reference center for the World Health Organization (WHO). (evidence)
Our Devices:
Sustainability: In order to ensure the sustainability of the project, we designed a biodegradable patch, no expensive, ergonomic, which only needs a small amount material (mg) and the process has been thought to produce the minimum amount of waste. The trap is washable and reusable by following standard decontamination procedures established by the center for rapid intervention at Pasteur (CIBU). (evidence)
Social Justice:
Our project try to address health issues that impact developing countries, it was developed to be easy to deployed in such areas. Our trap and patch are easy to use, and is aimed at not being expensive, by having no motorized parts, requiring batteries or electricity. We thought about two kinds of application scenarios: for developed and developing countries in terms of infrastructure and cost. (evidence) We also thought about education of young people coming from areas with different income. Thus we explained our the Mos(kit)o device, and educated about mosquitoes to both Parisian children (Collège Germaine de Staël, Mosquito chase game, Paris 15 arrondissement), and suburbs (“Jouer à Débattre”:Debate game on synthetic biology in Bobigny, Seine-St-Denis). (evidence)
Intellectual property rights
During the project development, law students in the team monitored that we were in line with Institut Pasteur policy and law.  So we take account of state of the art, no infrigement of Intellectual proprety laws. (evidence)
