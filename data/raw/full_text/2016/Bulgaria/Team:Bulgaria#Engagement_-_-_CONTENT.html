            During our work we made a survey and found out that Bulgarians
            were not familiar with the essence of synthetic biology.
            Therefore we decided to create a social campaign which aimed
            to introduce synthetic biology and inspire more young Bulgarians
            to do science. Our team held a number of events in the lab we
            are working in and involved students from various academic
            institutions. We popularized science in several high schools
            as well as in three of the biggest universities in the country.
            To educate people we went out in the busy streets of Sofia and
            showed people 3D models of cell organelles as well as structures
            of DNA and various proteins. That provoked interest in many
            of them and they were fascinated by synthetic biology and
            our innovative project.
        </P><P class="content">
            We invited our colleagues from the Faculty of Biology at the
            Sofia University to see our lab and find what a great opportunity
            the world of iGEM and synthetic biology provide. Many of them
            were interested in the competition and wanted to take part in
            future iGEM teams. Furthermore we participated in the The European
            Researchers' Night where we made demonstartions and presentations
            of our project. During the event people were able to see different microscope slides, we also explained how paternity testing is done and how an electrophoresis is run. The audience could work with us and spread cultures and take part in a discussion we organized – for or against genetically engineered organisms.  We were able to refute all controversial opinions and people intriguingly found out that genetic engineering is the door to many prominent future high-tech discoveries.

            Our public engagement drew the attention of major Bulgarian media
            (BiT, Nova TV, BTV, Boomberg, BNR, newspapers and online newsfeeds)
            which gave us the opportunity to educate publicly from their TV
            screens about the benefits from and the science that goes with
            genetically modified organisms. As a result of those broadcasts
            a lot of people contacted us and we organized meetings in several
            cafés where we answered all of their questions. Although we had
            only several months, we are convinced that thanks to our efforts
            the people we were able to reach became more familiar with the
            essence of synthetic biology and that we even inspired their
            interest in science as a whole.
