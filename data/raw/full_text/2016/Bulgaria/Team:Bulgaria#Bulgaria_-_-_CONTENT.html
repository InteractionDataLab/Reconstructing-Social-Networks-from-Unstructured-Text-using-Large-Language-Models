                Bulgarian yogurt is the most popular variety of yogurt in the
                world and is one of the things that make Bulgarians proud to
                call themselves Bulgarians; it is their exclusive invention
                and heritage that dates back many centuries. A mildly
                sour-tasting yogurt, “kiselo mlyako” is undoubtedly the
                best and the healthiest of all dairy products that are
                available to consumers nowadays. The western world calls
                it Bulgarian yogurt but in its homeland, Bulgaria, it’s
                called sour milk. Whatever the name, this wonderful
                probiotic food has impeccable ancestry - it is believed
                to have been known for at least 4000 years.
            </P></DIV><DIV class="yoghurt-making"><P class="intro">
                The Bulgarians have been making and eating yogurt for millennia. 
                Many eastern European peoples are descendants of nomads who lived
                on the fermented milk of their domesticated animals. The Bulgarians
                were renowned for their longevity and studies attributed their health
                to regular consumption of yogurt. Bulgarian yogurt became popular as
                one of the original health foods in the early 20th century due to
                these studies. The yogurt producing bacteria was firstly identified
                in Bulgaria, where it lives naturally in mammals’ gastrointestinal tract.
                That’s why the beneficial bacteria found in the Bulgarians' traditional
                yogurt carry their name, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. 
                This same beneficial bacteria forms the foundation of our yogurt. 
                The use of traditional methods of inoculation, fermentation and the
                use of glass containers produce a yogurt virtually identical to the 
                Bulgarian yogurt of Eastern Europe.

                Bulgarian yogurt comes under the general category of yogurts which
                contain live bacteria. For yogurt to be considered of the Bulgarian
                variety, it needs to be made with two specific starter bacteria,
                Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (often simply called
                Lactobacillus bulgaricus) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp.
                thermophilus (often shortened to Streptococcus thermophilus).
                Most yogurts contain these two as they are such excellent starters
                but most &quot;ordinary&quot; yogurt has other good bacteria added as well.
                
                It is the particular combination of bacteria that characterizes
                the thickness, acidity, taste and aroma of the yogurt. Kiselo
                mlyako's uniqueness lies in the peculiarities in the climate of
                the region and the very specific way in which it is prepared –
                using a combination of the two strains: Lactobacillus bulgaricus
                and Streptococcus thermophilus. The Streptococcus thermophilus
                bacteria goes into action first and prepares the perfect environment
                for Lactobacillus bulgaricus, which in turn starts multiplying and
                slowly turns the milk into yogurt.

                People who have tasted yogurt from countries all over the world
                always find that none of them tastes anything like the Bulgarian variety.
                Bulgarians completely agree that their yogurt is the best –
                some 400 000 tons are consumed every year in the country.
            </P></DIV><DIV class="yoghurt-history"><H1 class="title">History of Bulgarian Yogurt</H1><H5 class="alt-creator">Dr. Stamen Grigorov on a post stamp, 2005</H5><P class="intro">
                Bulgaria's long and affectionate relationship with yogurt dates back to
                the Thracians, ancient inhabitants of the Bulgarian lands, when
                stock-breeders placed sheep's milk in lambskin bags around their
                waists and fermented yogurt using their own body heat. The word
                'yogurt' is derived from the words for 'thick' and 'milk' in ancient
                Thracian. But being credited as the inventor is not Bulgaria's only
                source of yogurt pride; it is also credited with producing the
                healthiest yogurt in Europe, thanks to a unique bacteria native to the country.
                    
                In the early 1900s, a Bulgarian scientist called Dr. Stamen Grigorov,
                found an agent causing Bulgarian yogurt fermentation - a specific bacillus.
                Grigorov went on to pinpoint two more bacteria: a Streptobacillus and
                a harmful Streptoccus thermophilus which coexisted with that Lactobacillus
                in what appeared to be a perfect symbiosis. He also discovered that these
                two bacteria are not part of the micro-flora that exists in the human intestinal
                tract; however, they turn out to be very beneficial to it when introduced in it.
                    
                Interested in Dr. Grigorov's discoveries, another scientist, the Russian
                Ilya Mechnikov, a Nobel Prize laureate in Physiology and Medicine, went
                on to discover that more people lived to the age of 100 in Bulgaria than
                in any of the 36 other countries he studied. He directly linked this to
                the country's most traditional food - yogurt. According to Metchnikoff's
                research, the aging process results from the activity of putrefactive
                (proteolytic) microbes producing toxic substances in the large bowel.
                He knew that milk fermented with lactic-acid bacteria inhibits the
                growth of proteolytic bacteria because of the low pH produced by the
                fermentation of lactose. Based on these facts, Metchnikoff proposed
                that consumption of fermented milk would &quot;seed&quot; the intestine with harmless
                lactic-acid bacteria and decrease the intestinal pH and that this would suppress
                the growth of proteolytic bacteria, that he called &quot;Bulgarian Bacillus&quot;.
                
                Since then, yogurt has been credited with having a number of healthy effects
                on the human body, including reducing cholesterol, reducing unhealthy bacteria
                in the gastro-intestinal tract, increasing calcium levels and producing
                cancer-suppressing compounds.
