Bulgaria
We consider that human practices are incredibly important for integrating society to science. Our team endeavored to popularize synthetic biology through various ways in order to reach as many people as possible. Furthermore as future scientists it is our duty to meet responsibly the needs of society. Nowadays the fast-changing needs of consumers are becoming more dependent on the scientific method. The industrial problems are becoming much more complicated every year and we strived to keep up with this fast evolving situation. Additionally we have put our effort on creating a business case working model on our team and create a scientifically working method to optimize industrial production. As a result we were able to meet our financial needs and guarantee the teamâ€™s future work.
