Bulgaria
Being the first Bulgarian iGEM team was not an easy task.                 Sponsoring scientific research and projects in our country                 is not a common practice so the realization of our project                 would not have been possible without our entrepreneurship                 and marketing flair. The lack of money and the approaching                 deadline for registration motivated us to split the team                 in two workgroups. The first group was mostly concentrated                 in research and planning the biology work, whereas the second                 group was responsible for the popularization of the project                 and provision of financial resources for iGEM Bulgaria.                 Social networksâ€™ profiles for Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter                 and Indiegogo were developed and designed for different                 target groups. To optimize our organization and make                 our work flexible we used the online platforms Trello and Slack.
Our business plan was to create a product out of the iGEM                 idea and to sell it to companies as well as to individuals.                 For that we created a social campaign that aimed (and still aims)                 to convince more young Bulgarians to stay in our country, do                 science and fearlessly work for achieving their goals. Our                 enthusiasm drew the attention of several big media and soon                 we had our first donations. However, the amount of money                 raised was not enough so we took a risk and invested some                 of the money in T-shirts with our logo and moto. The idea                 was to create an additional possibility for revenue generation                 through direct sells and reinvestment in more T-shirts.
This strategy provided us the required money and we successfully                 registered for the competition. Our media broadcasts continued                 and as a result a Bulgarian employee in Thermofisher saw us and                 convinced the company to give us the consumables we needed to                 begin our work. As we gathered popularity we started offering                 different companies opportunities for sponsorship and partnership.                 We guaranteed them advertisement and involvement in an exciting                 and innovative project. As a result we established a long term                 partnership with the major biotech industry in Bulgaria,                 namely BioVet, which also supported us financially. We proved                 that iGEM could be sold as a social and scientific project                 and we believe that the brand could be used in future for                 the next competitions to come. This way we accomplished                 not only our immediate goal to raise the money necessary                 for the project, but also the aim of our campaign to provide                 opportunities for young people. Now the Bulgarian business                 community is more open towards collaboration with young                 scientists working on cutting-edge projects. We are convinced                 that this new attitude could trigger a whole new phase in                 the economic development of Bulgaria.
