                    Before any registration opening, before any people joining
                    the team, before you have your trainers, even before the
                    end of the previous Giant Jamboree you should be already
                    planning for your team. You have so many things to plan
                    and you have so many tasks ahead of you. Search for
                    people and find your lab space immediately. Just start early.
                </P></LI><LI class="single-tip"><H3 class="box-title">2.Think about the money in advance</H3><P class="box-content">
                    Money will not come on its own. You have to find it and
                    ask for it. Most reliable source are the universities
                    and most abundant source are the corporations. Both
                    of these plan their budgets very much in advance,
                    so they need to know that you need the money.
                    So go and tell them very early. Like immediately
                    after New Year’s break. Or even earlier.
                </P></LI><LI class="single-tip"><H3 class="box-title">3.Make your team’s success a public effort</H3><P class="box-content">
                    Even if all your above efforts seem in vain, do not despair.
                    The whole idea of having such young students working on actual
                    cutting-edge science project instead of drinking all summer long
                    seems very sexy to the society. So you may appeal to everybody to
                    help you a little bit, instead of waiting for the big money. You
                    are going to be surprised how much money you are going to raise
                    through small PayPal donations and even by just selling T-shirts
                    in the street. Also the consumables you need are not that many after
                    all, and there are numerous labs that could spare some of their
                    stockpiles to help you. But to achieve that, you have to convince
                    everybody that you are working for a noble cause. First, create
                    yourself an NGO. Then talk to the journalists, spread the news.
                    Have your grandma be proud of you and discuss your participation
                    with the neighbors. Have politicians come and take photos with you.
                    Finally, go in the streets, sell T-shirts or whatever you invent.
                    Become the news of the day.

                    Financial resources are important, but human capital
                    is THE resource. So if you are going to be one team
                    that works on the same task for the months to come,
                    you really need to know each other well. Even like
                    each other, if possible. So go to parties together,
                    hike together, hang out together the moment you
                    are collected as a team. Better resolve any personal
                    issues before you have to really start working hard.
                </P></LI><LI class="single-tip"><H3 class="box-title">5.Make sure you ALL love the project</H3><P class="box-content">
                    Scientific work, especially in Biology requires a lot of
                    efforts, so you need people to be really excited about
                    the project. Discuss it as long as it takes until
                    everybody is happy with it. Otherwise it won’t work.
                </P></LI><LI class="single-tip"><H3 class="box-title">6.Follow the deadlines</H3><P class="box-content">
                    Young people are used to a carefree life style
                    and they tend to try to avoid efforts. Especially
                    intelligent young people. So you have to learn to kick
                    your own but and be really careful about not missing any
                    deadlines, or you might screw up just because you have
                    forgotten to fill a form. The organizers usually send
                    reminders, many of them, but you cannot rely solely
                    on their efforts. Learn some discipline.
                </P></LI><LI class="single-tip"><H3 class="box-title">7.Ask for help</H3><P class="box-content">
                    Whatever happens, no matter how lost you feel, especially
                    when everything is going wrong, do not panic. Help comes
                    from unknown directions. You just need to ask for it. Ask
                    everywhere and everybody. Learn to have faith. And patience.
                </P></LI><LI class="single-tip"><H3 class="box-title">8.Work, work, work</H3><P class="box-content">
                    Even if you have provided for everything, you still need to
                    get the project done. So work all the time and work hard. Summer
                    is for vacations and all your friends are at the seaside, but you
                    need to carry on working. This is the only way to have good results.
                    No other option. And do not forget that you are going to have your
                    next Halloween in Boston, MA.
                </P></LI><LI class="single-tip"><H3 class="box-title">9.Try to make money</H3><P class="box-content">
                    Once the project is clear and you have some work done, think of the
                    people this project is going to be useful for. Maybe some businesses
                    could profit from your idea. Contact them. Explain them. Let them
                    understand. You may never know. Maybe this is the shortest way to your
                    first startup and possibly a future career. You have made a lot of
                    efforts. Try to get paid for them.
                </P></LI><LI class="single-tip"><H3 class="box-title">10.Be cool</H3><P class="box-content">
                    Whatever happens. Practical problems always have their practical solutions.
                    Just sit down, think and do your best. In the end of the day, no one is
                    going to die, are they? So just be cool. Always.
