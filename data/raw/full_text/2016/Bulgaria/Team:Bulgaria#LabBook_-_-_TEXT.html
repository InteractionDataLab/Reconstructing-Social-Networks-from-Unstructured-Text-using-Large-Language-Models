Organizational work. Fundraising - selling iGEM T-shirts to obtain finances for chemicals and kits.
Meetings with different biotech companies for sponsorships. Promoting the creation of the first                 Bulgarian iGEM team among different universities. Making list of the available equipment in                 different facilities that can be used for our future project.
Project proposals and discussions.
Voting and selection of the final topic. iGEM-BG has a project! ☺
Literature observation and discussions.
Collecting and cultivating different E.coli strains                 (DH5α, Top10, R. gammi), making glycerol stocks. Preparing                 antibiotic stocks and testing the optimal working concentrations.
Getting familiar with the lab equipment in our new lab (shakers,                 autoclaves, MiliQ system, laminar hoods, 3D-printer, PCR machines,                 gel imaging system). Familiarizing lab personal with the accompanying                 software products. Test of basic protocols (PCR, agarose gel,                 electroporation, making electrocompetent cells).
Demonstrational electroporation with several iGEM vectors (encoding                 for different chromoproteins) for general audience. Agarose gel                 electrophoresis and gel fragment purification for interested visitors.
Summer break + wiki research
Design and optimization of iGEM gBlocks for our proteins                 (SAHS2, MAHS, CASH and RvLEAM) + all primers for cloning                 and for colony PCR. In silicodesign of our constructs                 using SnapGene viewer and SerialCloner.
Waiting for IDT orders + preparation for The European researchers night
Test PCRs and cloning via CPEC (circular polymerase                 extension cloning) – no positive colonies were found.                 Further we try to clone our constructs via SLIC                 (sequence- and ligation-independent cloning) but                 again no positive colonies were found.
Literature research and selection of novel cloning strategy                 that is compatible with our cloning primers – selection of                 OEP (overlap extinction PCR).
PCR amplification of our CDSs and the LacI-tac control                 fragment. OEP, gel purification of the required bands,                 followed by electroporation. Positive clones have been                 identified via colony PCR.
Clone selections. Preparation of electrocompetent Rosetta                 gammi cells. Electroporation of the selected expression                 constructs in Rosetta gammi. Clone selections.
Initial expression tests – IPTG induction + PAGE                 (Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) in Rossetta gammi                 and Top10 and preparation of our poster
Freeze-thawing of cells followed by cell viability assays                 (Top10 and R. gami). These experiments are still in progress. iGEM presentation preparation.                 antibiotic stocks and testing the optimal working concentrations.
