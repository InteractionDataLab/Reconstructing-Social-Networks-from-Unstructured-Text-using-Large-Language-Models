Our project requires working environment corresponding to             Biosafety level 1. The microorganisms that we used to             construct our parts and express the proteins of interest             are different non-pathogenic strains of E. coli which do             not pose health risks. These strains are:
Top10
JW1
Nova Blue
DH5α
Rosetta gami
To protect ourselves from various risk factors in the laboratory             (and to protect our experiments from contamination as well) we             have created a set of rules that were strictly followed by all             team members. Those rules included working with standard protective             equipment – lab coats, gloves and safety googles. Wearing contact             lenses, jewelry and open footwear was not allowed. Long hairs were             kept tied. Machines like the autoclave that may pose risk were             properly maintained and handled with caution. Working with toxic             and volatile substances was conducted with face masks and in laminar             boxes in addition to the previously mentioned safety measures.             These and all other hazardous chemicals that may be dangerous for             the health or for the environment were disposed according to the             standard safety protocols. In addition general safety protocols for             lab behavior were applied accordingly. Each piece of equipment had             a responsible person that explained working protocols and safety             measure to all users.
