Omnia vincitamor.
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
I found the first Bulgarian iGEM team mainly because I was sure that Bulgarian students had the potential to succeed, but they needed to be proven so. Hopefully it will all end up well and they will become believers.
Slavil Peykov
Clinical Case Report:
Symptoms – patient can be located in a lab alarmingly often (mainly after 6:00 pm). He gets really excited by the look of several E. coli colonies on a LB Amp petri dish early in the morning. Searching of his computer showed six different cloning programs installed and recently used. Furthermore the patient was able to memorize and reproduce four symbol strings with length up to 5000 (plus finding small 6 or 8 elements palindromic motifs inside them).
Diagnosis – patient meets all diagnostically important criteria for a severe case of gene engineering obsession.
Prognosis – unfavourable. No treatment possibilities.
Future course of the disorder – it will involve contribution to different synthetic biology projects and initiatives. Participation in iGEM is both expected and inevitable.
Interests, hobbies, leisure time
Mainly natural sciences – everything from quarks to the Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall (yet living things with editable genomes come first). Outside science – gamebooks and computers.
I don’t forget that...
If you can amplify it – you can clone it!
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
Some of my best students made me an offer: “Please, come and help us with the design of our iGEM parts, show us how to clone them and tell us what to do next. By the way don’t worry about funds, chemicals, kits and lab space – we had all these arranged.” How could I say “No” to such an offer?

Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
iGEM challenged me! The competition provoked my curiosity. The whole process was a challenge for me - from the team building to the departure for the finals. I took the competition as a cause - Bulgarian and international. I wanted more young people  to participate and to have interest in science, to get out of the comfort zone and to create something by themselves. The thing that attracted me the most in iGEM is that there are no boundries in front of us. The competition gives us the opportunity to use our imagination and talents and all of our time in the name of the collective goal - the success.
