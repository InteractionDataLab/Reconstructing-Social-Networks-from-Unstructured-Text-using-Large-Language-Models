The final goal of our project was to develop a system capable to             improve a microorganism’s resistivity to extreme osmolarity and/or             temperature conditions. For that purpose we needed to identify             putative proteins capable of providing such properties to living             organisms and also to create a straightforward manner for their             expression in the targeted microorganisms.
After a thorough literature research we have identified the tardigrades             as most prominent species known for their capacity to survive freezing             and desiccation. Eventually we selected the following proteins             for expression in microorganisms:
Cytosolic abundant heat soluble protein 1 (CAHS1)
Secretary abundant heat soluble protein 2 (SAHS2)
Mitochondrial abundant heat soluble protein (MAHS)
Late embryogenesis abundant protein, mitochondrial (RvLEAM)
The protein sequences were codon-optimized and were synthesized             with appropriate flanking restriction sites (BioBrick’s prefix and suffix - Fig. 1).

Those synthetic genes were consequently used for the construction             of expression cassettes, which were controlled by a tac promotor             (repressible by lacI) and inserted in pSB1A3 vectors (Fig. 2).
Fig. 2 Schematic view of the used expression cassettes. Inducible             tac-lacO promoter drives the transcription of our sequences. Each             cassette also has the LacI regulator oriented in the opposite direction.             The pSB1A3 vector delivers transcriptional terminators at both sides of each cassette.
The plasmids thusly obtained were electroporated in Top10 E. coli strains             for plasmid multiplication and maintenance.
Next step was to introduce the expression plasmids in Rosetta gammi E. coli             strains for improved protein expression levels. The expression levels of             the putative protective proteins were measured through SDS-PAGE. Finally,             our engineered bacteria were tested for improved viability after freeze-thaw cycles.
