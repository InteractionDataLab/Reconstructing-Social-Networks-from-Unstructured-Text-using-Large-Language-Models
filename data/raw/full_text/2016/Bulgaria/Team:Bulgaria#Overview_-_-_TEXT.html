Bacteria I want to freeze!
We want to be able to freeze bacteria and revitalize them. Therefore, we decided to design a genetic           construct that could allow for the conversion of any microorganism into a                                                     resistant-towards-desiccation-and-temperature-stress type. To achieve this goal we get some inspiration from a very           small but yet very special animal – the tardigrade (Ramazzottius varieornatus).
Tardigrades are microscopic animals that can be found worldwide in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. They gather attention recently with their unique adaptation to a range of extreme environments. Most important for us is the fact that tardigrades can avoid freezing by supercooling to below -20 °C(3).  It has been shown that synthesis of bioprotectants in the form of selective proteins plays a role in their survivability. Such putative protective proteins are: Cytosolic abundant heat soluble protein 1 (CAHS1)(1,2) , Secretary abundant heat soluble protein 2 (SAHS2) (1,2), Mitochondrial abundant heat soluble protein (MAHS) (1,2), and Late embryogenesis abundant protein, mitochondrial (RvLEAM) (1,2).
Our project is an attempt to mimick the tardigrades unique survivability in different bacteria species via heterologous expression of protective proteins. We took the four previously mentioned proteins, after that we selected their longest isoforms and optimized these sequences for expression in E.coli. These constructs were ordered as gBlocks from IDT. Using iGEM parts delivered to us, we amplified an inducible promoter (tac-lacO) cassette and cloned it in front of our synthesized sequences using overlap extension PCR.
We took the generated constructs and electroporated them into Rosetta gammi strain (optimized for protein expression). Expression levels were monitored with SDS-PAGE. The cryoprotective potential of our devise was tested in freeze and thaw experiments followed by cell viability quantification.
Our further plans involve testing of our synthetic construct in Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, which is endemic for Bulgaria and a crucial producer in our food industry.
