                Being the first Bulgarian iGEM team was not an easy task.
                Sponsoring scientific research and projects in our country
                is not a common practice so the realization of our project
                would not have been possible without our entrepreneurship
                and marketing flair. The lack of money and the approaching
                deadline for registration motivated us to split the team
                in two workgroups. The first group was mostly concentrated
                in research and planning the biology work, whereas the second
                group was responsible for the popularization of the project
                and provision of financial resources for iGEM Bulgaria.
                Social networksâ€™ profiles for Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter
                and Indiegogo were developed and designed for different
                target groups. To optimize our organization and make
                our work flexible we used the online platforms Trello and Slack.
            </P></DIV><DIV class="business-plan"><P class="text">
                Our business plan was to create a product out of the iGEM
                idea and to sell it to companies as well as to individuals.
                For that we created a social campaign that aimed (and still aims)
                to convince more young Bulgarians to stay in our country, do
                science and fearlessly work for achieving their goals. Our
                enthusiasm drew the attention of several big media and soon
                we had our first donations. However, the amount of money
                raised was not enough so we took a risk and invested some
                of the money in T-shirts with our logo and moto. The idea
                was to create an additional possibility for revenue generation
                through direct sells and reinvestment in more T-shirts.
            </P></DIV><DIV class="strategy"><P class="text">
                This strategy provided us the required money and we successfully
                registered for the competition. Our media broadcasts continued
                and as a result a Bulgarian employee in Thermofisher saw us and
                convinced the company to give us the consumables we needed to
                begin our work. As we gathered popularity we started offering
                different companies opportunities for sponsorship and partnership.
                We guaranteed them advertisement and involvement in an exciting
                and innovative project. As a result we established a long term
                partnership with the major biotech industry in Bulgaria,
                namely BioVet, which also supported us financially. We proved
                that iGEM could be sold as a social and scientific project
                and we believe that the brand could be used in future for
                the next competitions to come. This way we accomplished
                not only our immediate goal to raise the money necessary
                for the project, but also the aim of our campaign to provide
                opportunities for young people. Now the Bulgarian business
                community is more open towards collaboration with young
                scientists working on cutting-edge projects. We are convinced
                that this new attitude could trigger a whole new phase in
                the economic development of Bulgaria.
