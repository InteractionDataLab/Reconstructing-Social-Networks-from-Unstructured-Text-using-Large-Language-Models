10 tips for newcomers
1.Start early
Before any registration opening, before any people joining                     the team, before you have your trainers, even before the                     end of the previous Giant Jamboree you should be already                     planning for your team. You have so many things to plan                     and you have so many tasks ahead of you. Search for                     people and find your lab space immediately. Just start early.
2.Think about the money in advance
Money will not come on its own. You have to find it and                     ask for it. Most reliable source are the universities                     and most abundant source are the corporations. Both                     of these plan their budgets very much in advance,                     so they need to know that you need the money.                     So go and tell them very early. Like immediately                     after New Year’s break. Or even earlier.
3.Make your team’s success a public effort
Even if all your above efforts seem in vain, do not despair.                     The whole idea of having such young students working on actual                     cutting-edge science project instead of drinking all summer long                     seems very sexy to the society. So you may appeal to everybody to                     help you a little bit, instead of waiting for the big money. You                     are going to be surprised how much money you are going to raise                     through small PayPal donations and even by just selling T-shirts                     in the street. Also the consumables you need are not that many after                     all, and there are numerous labs that could spare some of their                     stockpiles to help you. But to achieve that, you have to convince                     everybody that you are working for a noble cause. First, create                     yourself an NGO. Then talk to the journalists, spread the news.                     Have your grandma be proud of you and discuss your participation                     with the neighbors. Have politicians come and take photos with you.                     Finally, go in the streets, sell T-shirts or whatever you invent.                     Become the news of the day.
4.Get to know each other ASAP
Financial resources are important, but human capital                     is THE resource. So if you are going to be one team                     that works on the same task for the months to come,                     you really need to know each other well. Even like                     each other, if possible. So go to parties together,                     hike together, hang out together the moment you                     are collected as a team. Better resolve any personal                     issues before you have to really start working hard.
5.Make sure you ALL love the project
Scientific work, especially in Biology requires a lot of                     efforts, so you need people to be really excited about                     the project. Discuss it as long as it takes until                     everybody is happy with it. Otherwise it won’t work.
6.Follow the deadlines
Young people are used to a carefree life style                     and they tend to try to avoid efforts. Especially                     intelligent young people. So you have to learn to kick                     your own but and be really careful about not missing any                     deadlines, or you might screw up just because you have                     forgotten to fill a form. The organizers usually send                     reminders, many of them, but you cannot rely solely                     on their efforts. Learn some discipline.
7.Ask for help
Whatever happens, no matter how lost you feel, especially                     when everything is going wrong, do not panic. Help comes                     from unknown directions. You just need to ask for it. Ask                     everywhere and everybody. Learn to have faith. And patience.
8.Work, work, work
Even if you have provided for everything, you still need to                     get the project done. So work all the time and work hard. Summer                     is for vacations and all your friends are at the seaside, but you                     need to carry on working. This is the only way to have good results.                     No other option. And do not forget that you are going to have your                     next Halloween in Boston, MA.
9.Try to make money
Once the project is clear and you have some work done, think of the                     people this project is going to be useful for. Maybe some businesses                     could profit from your idea. Contact them. Explain them. Let them                     understand. You may never know. Maybe this is the shortest way to your                     first startup and possibly a future career. You have made a lot of                     efforts. Try to get paid for them.
10.Be cool
Whatever happens. Practical problems always have their practical solutions.                     Just sit down, think and do your best. In the end of the day, no one is                     going to die, are they? So just be cool. Always.
