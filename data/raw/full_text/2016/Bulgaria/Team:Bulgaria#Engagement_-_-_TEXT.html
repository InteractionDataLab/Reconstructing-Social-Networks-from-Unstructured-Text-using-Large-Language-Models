Public Engagement
During our work we made a survey and found out that Bulgarians             were not familiar with the essence of synthetic biology.             Therefore we decided to create a social campaign which aimed to introduce synthetic biology and inspire more young Bulgarians             to do science. Our team held a number of events in the lab we             are working in and involved students from various academic             institutions. We popularized science in several high schools             as well as in three of the biggest universities in the country.             To educate people we went out in the busy streets of Sofia and             showed people 3D models of cell organelles as well as structures             of DNA and various proteins. That provoked interest in many             of them and they were fascinated by synthetic biology and             our innovative project.
We invited our colleagues from the Faculty of Biology at the             Sofia University to see our lab and find what a great opportunity             the world of iGEM and synthetic biology provide. Many of them             were interested in the competition and wanted to take part in             future iGEM teams. Furthermore we participated in the The European             Researchers' Night where we made demonstartions and presentations             of our project. During the event people were able to see different microscope slides, we also explained how paternity testing is done and how an electrophoresis is run. The audience could work with us and spread cultures and take part in a discussion we organized – for or against genetically engineered organisms.  We were able to refute all controversial opinions and people intriguingly found out that genetic engineering is the door to many prominent future high-tech discoveries.
Our public engagement drew the attention of major Bulgarian media             (BiT, Nova TV, BTV, Boomberg, BNR, newspapers and online newsfeeds)             which gave us the opportunity to educate publicly from their TV             screens about the benefits from and the science that goes with             genetically modified organisms. As a result of those broadcasts             a lot of people contacted us and we organized meetings in several             cafés where we answered all of their questions. Although we had             only several months, we are convinced that thanks to our efforts             the people we were able to reach became more familiar with the             essence of synthetic biology and that we even inspired their             interest in science as a whole.
