nothing can stop us
The participation in the competition iGEM is making us                             the first Bulgarian team, and that's why this cause is                             so important for us. Our responsibility is even greater                             and our desire to succeed and achieving it - more secure.
we solve problems together
We solve all the difficulties together because we are one real team.
we work with passion
Our love in biology is the unifying force that brought                             together people with different professions, personalities,                             interests. The passion for science is the reason we all fight                             together for the realisation of the ultimate goal.
