Bulgaria
Bulgaria
Bulgaria is the land of roses and yogurt, located in             the heart of the Balkans. The country is famous for its beautiful nature – it has both high mountains and             seaside, which makes Bulgaria an attractive tourist destination.
The people
The people are warm and cheerful, the folklore is a rich mix                 of Thracian, Slavic and Bulgarian heritage.
Bulgarian Yogurt
Bulgarian yogurt is the most popular variety of yogurt in the                 world and is one of the things that make Bulgarians proud to                 call themselves Bulgarians; it is their exclusive invention                 and heritage that dates back many centuries. A mildly                 sour-tasting yogurt, “kiselo mlyako” is undoubtedly the                 best and the healthiest of all dairy products that are                 available to consumers nowadays. The western world calls                 it Bulgarian yogurt but in its homeland, Bulgaria, it’s                 called sour milk. Whatever the name, this wonderful                 probiotic food has impeccable ancestry - it is believed                 to have been known for at least 4000 years.
The Bulgarians have been making and eating yogurt for millennia.                  Many eastern European peoples are descendants of nomads who lived                 on the fermented milk of their domesticated animals. The Bulgarians                 were renowned for their longevity and studies attributed their health                 to regular consumption of yogurt. Bulgarian yogurt became popular as                 one of the original health foods in the early 20th century due to                 these studies. The yogurt producing bacteria was firstly identified                 in Bulgaria, where it lives naturally in mammals’ gastrointestinal tract.                 That’s why the beneficial bacteria found in the Bulgarians' traditional                 yogurt carry their name, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.                  This same beneficial bacteria forms the foundation of our yogurt.                  The use of traditional methods of inoculation, fermentation and the                 use of glass containers produce a yogurt virtually identical to the                  Bulgarian yogurt of Eastern Europe.
Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus
Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus
Bulgarian yogurt comes under the general category of yogurts which                 contain live bacteria. For yogurt to be considered of the Bulgarian                 variety, it needs to be made with two specific starter bacteria,                 Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (often simply called                 Lactobacillus bulgaricus) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp.                 thermophilus (often shortened to Streptococcus thermophilus).                 Most yogurts contain these two as they are such excellent starters                 but most "ordinary" yogurt has other good bacteria added as well. It is the particular combination of bacteria that characterizes                 the thickness, acidity, taste and aroma of the yogurt. Kiselo                 mlyako's uniqueness lies in the peculiarities in the climate of                 the region and the very specific way in which it is prepared –                 using a combination of the two strains: Lactobacillus bulgaricus                 and Streptococcus thermophilus. The Streptococcus thermophilus                 bacteria goes into action first and prepares the perfect environment                 for Lactobacillus bulgaricus, which in turn starts multiplying and                 slowly turns the milk into yogurt.
People who have tasted yogurt from countries all over the world                 always find that none of them tastes anything like the Bulgarian variety.                 Bulgarians completely agree that their yogurt is the best –                 some 400 000 tons are consumed every year in the country.
History of Bulgarian Yogurt
Dr. Stamen Grigorov on a post stamp, 2005
Bulgaria's long and affectionate relationship with yogurt dates back to                 the Thracians, ancient inhabitants of the Bulgarian lands, when                 stock-breeders placed sheep's milk in lambskin bags around their                 waists and fermented yogurt using their own body heat. The word                 'yogurt' is derived from the words for 'thick' and 'milk' in ancient                 Thracian. But being credited as the inventor is not Bulgaria's only                 source of yogurt pride; it is also credited with producing the                 healthiest yogurt in Europe, thanks to a unique bacteria native to the country.
In the early 1900s, a Bulgarian scientist called Dr. Stamen Grigorov,                 found an agent causing Bulgarian yogurt fermentation - a specific bacillus.                 Grigorov went on to pinpoint two more bacteria: a Streptobacillus and                 a harmful Streptoccus thermophilus which coexisted with that Lactobacillus                 in what appeared to be a perfect symbiosis. He also discovered that these                 two bacteria are not part of the micro-flora that exists in the human intestinal                 tract; however, they turn out to be very beneficial to it when introduced in it.
Interested in Dr. Grigorov's discoveries, another scientist, the Russian                 Ilya Mechnikov, a Nobel Prize laureate in Physiology and Medicine, went                 on to discover that more people lived to the age of 100 in Bulgaria than                 in any of the 36 other countries he studied. He directly linked this to                 the country's most traditional food - yogurt. According to Metchnikoff's                 research, the aging process results from the activity of putrefactive                 (proteolytic) microbes producing toxic substances in the large bowel.                 He knew that milk fermented with lactic-acid bacteria inhibits the                 growth of proteolytic bacteria because of the low pH produced by the                 fermentation of lactose. Based on these facts, Metchnikoff proposed                 that consumption of fermented milk would "seed" the intestine with harmless                 lactic-acid bacteria and decrease the intestinal pH and that this would suppress                 the growth of proteolytic bacteria, that he called "Bulgarian Bacillus".
Since then, yogurt has been credited with having a number of healthy effects                 on the human body, including reducing cholesterol, reducing unhealthy bacteria                 in the gastro-intestinal tract, increasing calcium levels and producing                 cancer-suppressing compounds.
Bulgarian Yogurt
Here's a short list to outline some benefits of consuming Bulgarian yogurt:
Yogurt is identified as a reason for longevity. Bulgaria is one of                     the countries with the biggest number of people aged 100 years and older.
Bulgarian yogurt is one of the best probiotics out there.
Yogurt is an excellent source of "good" bacteria that is needed                     in the digestive tract. Active live cultures are basically good                     bacteria that are necessary for the body to function at its best.                     These good bacteria prevent the growth of harmful bacteria that                     cause bacterial infections and diseases. Healthy levels of good                     bacteria also promote digestive health and boost the immune system.
Yogurt strengthens the immune system and helps prevents tumor growth.
Its high concentration of calcium also helps against osteoporosis and reduces cholesterol levels.
It reduces the risk of high blood pressure.
Active cultures help certain gastrointestinal conditions including                     lactose intolerance, constipation, diarrhea, colon cancer,                     inflammatory bowel disease, H. pylori infection and many others.
Bulgarian yogurt is organic yogurt and organic yogurt is an                     excellent diet food. Not only yogurt is nutritionally sound                     but it also makes you feel fuller faster. It is a good source of proteins too.
