He gets really excited by the look of several E. coli colonies on a LB Amp petri dish early in the morning. Searching of his computer showed six different cloning programs installed and recently used. Furthermore the patient was able to memorize and reproduce four symbol strings with length up to 5000 (plus finding small 6 or 8 elements palindromic motifs inside them).
                    <STRONG>Diagnosis</STRONG> – patient meets all diagnostically important criteria for a severe case of gene engineering obsession.
                    <STRONG>Prognosis</STRONG> – unfavourable. No treatment possibilities.
