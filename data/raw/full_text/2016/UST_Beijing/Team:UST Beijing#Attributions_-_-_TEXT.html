Leader：Wang Chongyang Luo Jingyun devotes himself to the electrophoresis. Cui Xinying, Zhang Mu, Li Mengqian, Liu Feng, Sun Zhihang, Yang Jie, ZengYueying, Zhang Huicong, Yan Quanlei, Huang Tianqi, Cheng Linxia, Su Xueying, Hu Xiaoxuan, Ma Yimeng make lots of contributions to build the double-plasmid E. coli. This part is very difficult to do and take them lots of effort to finish. Wang Chongyang，He Yu, Mo Yuxuan work together to explore the effective system of Solid Fermentation. Li Hui and Feng Zhuo do the experiment of the test toβ-Glu. Ding Xue, Wang Chongyang, Zhang Zelong, Chen Ran, Zhen Zhan are distributed to do the animal experiment, so they raised a lot of cute Gophers. Wang Chongyang, Mo Yuxuan, Liu Xiaoxiao, Nadire work together to determine the concentration of Cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood from the Gophers . Liu Xiaoxiao works for our wonderful wiki pages and writes lots of codes. Dingxue are responsible for date processing and design out team T-shirt. Liao Xinyu, Qiang Rong create an algorithm named PanGu which can find the ancestor of neighbor species and built modeling for our experiment. Wang Chongyang, Zhang Zelong are responsible to design, synthesis and verify the plasmid named BBa_K20732000 Chen Ran, Nadire Azhati, Mo Yuxuan contribute to test the interaction of double-plasmid E.coli and Lac&Ara.

Difficult technique support
Thanks to Prof. ChingSong and Prof. LuoHui of important advice that makes us overcome many diffcults.
Presentation coaching
Thanks to Prof. Ching Song's advice and guidance during our Presentation.
And last but not least
Plasmid pET28a-beta-glucosidase was constructed by Han Zhong Ke in 2014. pSB1C3-BBa_K2072000 was synthesized in vitro in four overlapped 1.5kb DNA fragments by generous free service of IDT and ligated by Gibson assembly using a commercial kit.  We would like to pay tribute and respect to the sacrifice of Gophers and thank all the people who helped our experiments.
