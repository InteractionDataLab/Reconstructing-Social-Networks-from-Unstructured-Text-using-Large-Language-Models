As early as April of this year, we started to prepare for our project. After the brainstorming, we thought we had a perfect idea, and decided to take action. There have been many failures in the process of experiment, but these failures make the success even more exciting. Here records good memories of these months.
Preparation I: Refer to Literature
April to May
We searched some literature on notoginseng and glucosidase in the database and learned about these papers. We revived E. coli containing β-glucosidase and extracted the plasmid of β-glu. Then the plasmid was cut with NcoI and XhoI in the 37℃ for 1 h.After electrophoresis, we confirmed that plasmid was correct and it can be used in the next experiments.
Preparation II: Liquid fermentation
May to June
The E. coli was centrifuged and the precipitation was immersed with different osmotic pressure buffer to draw β-glu expressed by E. coli. After drawing enzyme, we added different volumes of enzyme solution and pNPG to each well on the 96-well plate and made the bulk equal with extract buffer. OD450 was measured every one hour.
Preparation III: Enzyme activity determination
April to May
E. coli expressed β-glucosidase was fermented in a 3L fermenter. And we collected a small of fermentation sample at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20 and 24 hours since the fermentation start. After centrifugation, β-glu was extracted from the cell. And we tested the activity of the enzyme extracted from different growth stages of E. coli on a 96-well plate with pNPG as the substrate.
Week 1
7/4-7/10
Solid fermentation: notoginseng and water were mixed in a appropriate proportion. After boiling the mixture, we put the paste of notoginseng into glass containers. Then inoculate rhizopus , 25℃, to the fermentor.
Animal experiment : 15 mices were weighed and divided into three groups. Each of group was fed different content of notoginseng.
Transformation experiment: Amplification of pSB1C3-T7RNAp plasmid. We transformed the plasmid into DN5α, and spread E. coli on an LB plate containing Chloramphenicol. After 12h, a monoclonal colony was amplification and was stored at -80 ℃ with 25 % glycerol. The plasmids were obtained from the monoclonal E. coli and stored at -20 ℃. The β-glucosidase plasmid was extracted from E. coli and stored at -20 ℃, too.
Week 2
7/11-7/17
Animal experiment: Mices were killed and serum cholesterol was measured.
Solid fermentation: The reducing sugar concentration of the notoginseng was determined by DNS solution
Transformation experiment: The T7RNAp-plasmid and β-glu-plasmid was mixed with DH5α together and was settled in ice for 30 min. Then the mixture was moved to 42 ℃ water bath for 90 s and settled in ice for 3 min . The SOC medium was added in the tube and we put the tube in the 37 ℃ shaker for 1 h. Lastly we screened the E. coli with double plasmid by LB plate containing chloramphenicol and kanamycin. The result was that there was nothing on the plate after a few days.

Week 3
7/18-7/24
Solid fermentation: Took the notoginseng sterilization by boiling  and sprinkled it into the mold, yeast, probiotic bacteria, 25℃, to fermentation.
Transformation experiment: We found the possibility of transforming two plasmids simultaneously was too small. So we transformed T7RNAp into DH5α firstly. Then we transformed β-glu plasmids into the new-made competent cells and spread them on double antibiotic plate. Unfortunately there was still nothing on the surface of plate.
Week 4
7/25-7/31
Animal experiment: The hamsters were divided into four groups, and each group was fed with different high-fat diet containing notoginseng powder.
Solid fermentation: The treated and untreated notoginseng was sterilized by boiling, adding two glassware into the yeast fermentation.
Transformation experiment: After transferring the T7RNAp plasmid into the E. coli containing β-glu plasmid, we spread the E. coli on the LB plate with chloramphenicol and kanamycin. After about one or two day, surprisingly, we found a few colonies on the double antibiotic plates. Finally we got a E. coli strain that is regulated by arabinose and express β-glu theoretically.

Week 5
8/1-8/7
We extracted the two plasmid from the cell with kits, and cut them with restriction endonucleases BglⅡ,XhoⅠ,EcoRⅠrespectively. Then we found an interesting phenomenon that the two plasmids recombined to a big plasmid.

Week 6
8/8-8/14
Solid fermentation: The reducing sugar concentration of the notoginseng was determined by DNS solution. BL21(DE3) containing the double-resistant plasmid was ultrasonically disrupted. The pieces were detected by PNPG in 96-well plant.
Transformation experiment: For confirming the safety of our organism, we used LB without antibiotic to cultivate the double-plasmid E. coli for a few days. And we spread a little E. coli on antibiotic and antibiotic-free LB solid medium. About 10 days later, the antibiotic plate had 47 colonies and the antibiotic-free plate had about 12,000 colonies. The result indicated that there was only 0.4 % E.coli containing the two plasmids.
Week 7
8/15-8/21
Induced experiment : The expression of glucosidase was induced by different concentrations of lactose and arabinose and detected by PNPG . In order to ensure the repeatability of the experiment, we repeat the experiment , and the results remain the same.
