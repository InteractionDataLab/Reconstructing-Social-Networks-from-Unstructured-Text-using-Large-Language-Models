iGUT: for notoginseng
Synthetic biology & Chinese Medicine
Achievement
We built a double-plasmid system in E.coli and explained controlling factors of enzyme activity of double-plasmid E.coli. with a mathematical equation. As a report bacteria, E.coli cells expressing RFP were cultured in original system——Rhizoppus-Ecoli fermentation system.  We designed a glucosidase-expressed plasmid under the control of arabinose.

Project
We set up a mixed fermentation system using the notoginseng root solid fermentation with rhizopus oryzae for the culture of E.coli. We designed a plasmid which bidirectionally express the genes of β-Glucosidase and araC. We transformed pSB1C3-T7RNApol and pET28(a)-β-glucosidase into the E.coli and built a mathematical model of recombination E.coli.

Modeling
We Built a double-plasmid system in  E.coli and  found out the recombination of two plasmids. Besides, we illustrated the structure of recombinant phasmid using endonuclease digestion. And explaining controlling factors of enzyme activity of double-plasmid E.coli. We have constructed synthetic plasmid expressing β-glucosidase under the control of arabinose.

Practices
We hold a introduction meeting of products in community.  We communicated with resident who live in the neighbourhood of ZhiXin friendly, and introduced our project.  Let more people understand our intent, and synthetic biology, as well as the potential capacity of remodeling the traditional Chinese medicinal materials by modern science technology.
