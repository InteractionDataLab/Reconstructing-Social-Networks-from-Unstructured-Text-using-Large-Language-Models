Since 2010 we have been participating in synthetic biology and iGEM competition. In 2016, more than ever, the iGEM community has established the most stringent rules handling genetic material. We have made a plan to the detail, as well as the laboratory rules and regulations to ensure our experiments could be safe and orderly. With various means, the genetic engineering strain was guaranteed to pose no threat to the researchers, people around us, and environment in general. Besides, our genetic-engineered strains did not have changed genomic sequences and their plasmids were gradually lost in continuous culture in the absence of antibiotics.

Experiment plan
In our experiments, we also used Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhizopus oryzae, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium breve to ferment the notogensing root powder. All these microorganisms were purchased commericially from a supermarket and considered GRAS. We aim at breaking down the cell wall of notogensing root cells.
About our project
E.coli strain BL21(DE3) has been transformed with two plasmids. They could express beta-glucosidase to hydrolyze the saccharides of saponins in notogensing root to improve bio-availability. In addition, BL21(AI) strain has been transformed with one plasmid to test expression efficiency of the beta-glucosidase. Furthermore, we used traditional methods, e.g. weak acid to hydrolyze notoginseng saponins and GRAS strains in solid fermentation, to explore bio-availability improvement.
About risk
Risks of our experiments include escape of our engineered bacteria. To prevent the accident from happening, we used strongest commercial disinfectants we can find to treat all experimental materials exposed to bacteria.  Furthermore, we designed a mock escape experiment and reconfirmed ourselves that plasmids we used lacked genetic stability in our bacteria under culturing conditions without appropriate antibiotics. The result suggests that the plasmid will be lost in short time if the bacteria escapes the lab culture conditions.
If we fully develop fermented notoginseng into a real product, there will be some risks for real people. For instance, during the process of notoginseng solid fermentation, some other unwanted microorganisms may pollute our product, such as A. flavus. It may pose a hidden danger for human health.
Further comments
Our project focus on human health, and it will benefit all the people around the world, regardless of personal wealth. People can use our DIY method to produce their own health product of notoginseng.
