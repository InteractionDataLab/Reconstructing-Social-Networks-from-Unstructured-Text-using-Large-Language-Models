It serves as an element of the Team NJU-CHINA RNAi module which can be used for down-regulation of KRAS expression in lung adenocarcinoma cells. We designed specific KRAS siRNA with algorithm based on a software developed by SYSU-Software team. This tool can find the best siRNA sequence on target gene KRAS to ascertain the maximum gene-specificity and silencing efficacy and also designs the pair of oligonucleotides needed to generate short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in the plasmid. Then we synthesize the shRNA sequence from a DNA synthesis company (Genscript).</P><DIV align="middle">Figure 1. The sequence of KRAS shRNA</DIV><H4>Usage and Biology</H4><P style="padding-top: 0;">We packaged KRAS siRNA into exosomes by transfecting HEK293 cells with a plasmid expressing KRAS siRNA and then collected siRNA-encapsulated exosomes. When modified exosomes being intravenously injected, they will specifically recognize integrin receptors and fuse with lung adenocarcinoma cells under the direction of the iRGD peptide. Once inside cells, KRAS siRNA will bind to KRAS mRNA through base-pairing and digest the mRNA, resulting in sharp decrease of K-ras in lung cancer cells. As a consequence, K-ras protein’s reduction and disturbed function will both result in the inhabitation of the proliferation of cancer cells, which ultimately have some therapeutic effects on lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer in this case).</P><H4>Characterization</H4><H5>Interference efficiency of anti-KRAS siRNA plasmid</H5><P style="padding-top: 0;">To ensure the interference efficiency of anti-KRAS siRNA plasmid, we transfected it into human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and then extracted protein from these cells to perform western blot. Significant down-regulation of K-ras can be observed in A549 cells treated with anti-KRAS siRNA, demonstrating that anti-KRAS siRNA has the gene silencing effect on lung cancer cells.</P><DIV align="middle" style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Figure 2.

Importantly, this effect did not require the drugs to be chemically conjugated to the peptide. To enhance the accuracy of drug delivery system and improve targeting index of drugs, iRGD peptide was displayed on the surface of the exosome containing our previously designed siRNA, allowing us to target recipient cells in vivo efficiently. Lamp-2b is a protein found specifically abundant in exosomal membranes. So we connect iRGD with Lamp2b by a glycine-linker, and promote the expression using cmv promoter. We engineered our chassis, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, to express iRGD-Lamp2b fusion protein. Therefore, the iRGD exosomes (iRGD-Exos) are endowed with site-specific recognition ability and were purified from cell culture supernatants and loaded with Dox by electroporation.</P><H4>Characterization</H4><P style="padding-top: 0;">The iRGD-Lamp2b expressing vector was thoroughly described in Tian’s article (Yanhua Tian, et al. Biomaterials, 2013). He showed that exosomes, endogenous nano-sized membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types, could deliver chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin (Dox) to tumor tissue in BALB/c nude mice. To reduce immunogenicity and toxicity, mouse immature dendritic cells (imDCs) were used for exosome production. Tumor targeting was facilitated by engineering the imDCs to express a well-characterized exosomal membrane protein (Lamp2b) fused to αν integrin-specific iRGD peptide (CRGDKGPDC). Purified exosomes from imDCs were loaded with Dox via electroporation, with an encapsulation efficiency of up to 20%. iRGD exosomes showed highly efficient targeting and Dox delivery to αν integrin-positive breast cancer cells in vitro as demonstrated by confocal imaging and flow cytometry. Intravenously injected targeted exosomes delivered Dox specifically to tumor tissues, leading to inhibition of tumor growth without overt toxicity. The results suggested that exosomes modified by targeting ligands could be used therapeutically for the delivery of Dox to tumors, thus having great potential value for clinical applications in our project.</P></DIV></LI></UL></DIV><DIV id="Validations" class="col s12"><UL class="collapsible popout" data-collapsible="expandable"><LI><DIV class="collapsible-header active"><I class="material-icons">filter_drama</I>Silencing capability validation in vitro</DIV><DIV class="collapsible-body"><H5>1.1 KRAS siRNA interference efficiency verification in vitro</H5><P style="padding-top: 0;">To ensure the interference efficiency of anti-KRAS siRNA, we transfected the plasmid loaded with this siRNA into human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and extracted protein to perform western blot.

The TEM image showed that the exosomes presented normal morphological characteristics after outside modification and siRNA loading, with a diameter of approximately 200 nanometer and a double-layer membrane. </P><DIV align="middle">Figure 4.

The use of Nanosight enabled quantification and size determination of the extracellular vesicles, as nanoparticles can be automatically tracked and sized based on Brownian motion and the diffusion coefficient. The size of exosomes attained ranged around 270nm. Basing the particle size and relative intensity, we also created a 3D plot for a visual explanation. Under measurement condition listed, the exosomes secreted by HEK293 cells were assayed for 2.95 E8 particles each milliliter. Then the relationship between particle number and protein was determined that exosomes in 1 ng protein were equivalent to 6277.95 particles, according to the dilution multiple (24) and protein concentration (1127.756 ng/ul) we have tested. All the data collected helped us decide the transfection dosage of siRNA and dosing of treatment prepared for animal experiment.</P><DIV align="middle">Figure 5.

The KRAS expression level was assayed in A549 cells after co-cultured with exosomal KRAS siRNA. Non-loaded iRGD-exosomes were used as control to ascertain that any RNAi response observed did not derive from the exosomes per se. The western electrophoresis and knockdown data obtained from qPCR analysis of KRAS gene expression indicated that KRAS protein and mRNA levels both dramatically decreased in the cells incubating with iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA compared with cells treating with nude exosomes or without any treatment. This result suggests that iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA can deliver siRNA into target cells and finally reduce the KRAS expression.</P><DIV align="middle">Figure 6.

For further verification, we examined the role of iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA in cell proliferation. An EDU assay using Cell-Light™ EdUTP Apollo®567 TUNEL Cell Detection Kit, was carried out after siRNA-iRGD-exosome incubation and as a control, nude exosomes were also treated to A549 cells. The result indicated that KRAS knockdown had an anti-proliferation effect on lung tumor cells while nude exosomes were not capable of inhibiting the growth of tumor cells. </P><DIV align="middle" style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Figure 7.

Our project aimed to develop a drug system that employed modified exosomes with iRGD peptide on its surface to deliver KRAS-siRNA into lung cancer cells specifically, thus target KRAS gene and down-regulate K-ras protein expression to treat lung cancer cases. Our results had demonstrated that iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA can be delivered into tumor cells and efficiently down-regulate KRAS expression both in vitro and in vivo. In silencing validation, we transfected KRAS siRNA into A549 cells using Lipo 2000 and performed western blot to test the function of our siRNA. Subsequently, we collected iRGD-modified exosomes loaded with KRAS siRNA, evaluating its effect on lung cancer cells (A549) by examining KRAS expression after transfection. The result confirmed that iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA could effectively down-regulate KRAS transcription level and reduce its protein expression.
