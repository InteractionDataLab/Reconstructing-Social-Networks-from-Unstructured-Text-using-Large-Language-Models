It was founded in winter of year 2015, 3 months after which the general topic of this project (a new treatment for cancer) was determined through the process of brainstorming, article reading and debating. Then questionnaires had been sent out to get public expectation for cancer treatment. Under the guidance of Prof. Xi Chen and Prof. Chenyu Zhang, and based on survey results and deeper understanding of related research articles, the ultimate idea was established on March of 2016.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="section"><UL class="collapsible"><LI><DIV class="collapsible-header active"><I class="material-icons">person_pin</I>Chenhui Deng</DIV><DIV class="collapsible-body"><P>Chenhui Deng is one of the two who in charge of all the qPCR experiments in both in vivo and in vitro validation of iRGD-siRNA-exosome function. It was him who pointed out that we should referred to the view from public (both general one and patients) to value if our idea did have its practical significance. He will represent the whole team to present our project at the final Jamboree.</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="collapsible-header"><I class="material-icons">person_pin</I>Jingyi Chen</DIV><DIV class="collapsible-body"><P>Jingyi Chen learned cell proliferation assay and endotoxin detecting assay from our advisors, two graduate students in Prof. Xi Chen’s lab, to ascertain iRGD-siRNA-exosome can suppress cancer cells’ proliferation and to prove our drug system is nontoxic for normal cells, respectively. In human practice, she accompany with Jiaxin Cai to deeply interview the doctor from a local hospital.
