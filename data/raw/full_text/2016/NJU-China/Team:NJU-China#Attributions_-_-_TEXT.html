Team
The team consists of students from different grades of bachelor’s degree, armed with varied but complementary expertise. It was founded in winter of year 2015, 3 months after which the general topic of this project (a new treatment for cancer) was determined through the process of brainstorming, article reading and debating. Then questionnaires had been sent out to get public expectation for cancer treatment. Under the guidance of Prof. Xi Chen and Prof. Chenyu Zhang, and based on survey results and deeper understanding of related research articles, the ultimate idea was established on March of 2016.
person_pinChenhui Deng
Chenhui Deng is one of the two who in charge of all the qPCR experiments in both in vivo and in vitro validation of iRGD-siRNA-exosome function. It was him who pointed out that we should referred to the view from public (both general one and patients) to value if our idea did have its practical significance. He will represent the whole team to present our project at the final Jamboree.
person_pinJingyi Chen
Jingyi Chen learned cell proliferation assay and endotoxin detecting assay from our advisors, two graduate students in Prof. Xi Chen’s lab, to ascertain iRGD-siRNA-exosome can suppress cancer cells’ proliferation and to prove our drug system is nontoxic for normal cells, respectively. In human practice, she accompany with Jiaxin Cai to deeply interview the doctor from a local hospital. Also, she will present our project at the final Jamboree together with Chenhui Deng.
person_pinXiaoyang Gu
Xiaoyang Gu is the master of western blot, conducting all the experiments that proved significant decrease of our target gene (KRAS) in the protein level after treated with iRGD-siRNA-exosomes. During this process, she learned transmission electron microscope assay (TEM) from a graduate student in Prof. Xi Chen’s lab, to ensure we get exosomes after collection assay according to the morphology of the harvest, and also determine exosomes’ density.
person_pinYingzi Chai
Yingzi Chai is responsible for our BioBricks construction and has persistently performed cloning for genes of shRNA and iRGD-Lamp2b fusion protein. She did qPCR experiments for siRNA’s silencing validation in vivo and in vitro together with Chenhui Deng. Besides, she is the third person who will present our work at the Giant Jamboree.
person_pinYue Peng
Yue Peng learned animal model and cell culture from graduate students and designed our non-small cell lung cancer mouse models. In addition, she was the babysitter of both our chassis cells and cancer cells, setting the basis of all the in vivo and in vitro experiments. And after we got our questionnaires back from both general public and cancer patients, she did the analysis and made conclusion from the survey.
person_pinZining Yang
Zining Yang learned animal surgery from graduate students, conducting both intravenous exosome injection and lung tumor harvest and measurement. Her work proved our drug system could truly have effects on tumor cells in vivo. Moreover, she designed our questionnaires for general public, to get their cognition of cancer and its related treatment.
person_pinJiaxin Cai
Jiaxin Cai is a junior student from the School of Journalism and Communication. She’s interested in our idea of combining scientific research with realistic social problems, thus provided her great help in our public outreach. She designed questionnaires for cancer patients and conducted deep interviews with patients and doctors, summarized their points of view about new treatment of cancer cases and especially about our project.
person_pinYandong Liu
Yandong Liu is responsible for our website design and construction. He cooperated with other team members to finish this wiki and made it to be fascinating. His continuous debugging and considerate web layout made it welcoming and comfortable for our wiki readers.
person_pinWaner Jiang and Ling Jin
Waner Jiang and Ling Jin are senior students from the School of Life Sciences and have joined an iGEM team last year. They founded this team, recruited all the members and allocated assignments to us everyone based on our specialties and interests. There is no doubt that their outstanding leadership ensured everything that needed to be done would finally get settled.
Advisors
Yanbo Wang and Minghui Liu are graduate students from Prof. Xi Chen’s lab and are the prime guides for all of our lab work. We developed from newcomers in science research to an experienced lab worker due to their unreserved help and advice during this long period.
Instructors
Yu Zhou and Dongxia Hou have their expertise in synthetic biology and provided practical suggestions during our generation of this project’s ideas.
Acknowledgement
It has been a long way for NJU-China from organizing the team to writing this. We would like to express our most sincere gratitude to every individual and institute that helped us during the valuable 257 days:
Thank Prof. Zhang Chenyu and Prof. Chen Xi for their unwavering support who helped the revision of the idea. Thank our advisors Liu Minghui and Wang Yanbo for their assistance on our experiments. Thank our instructor Zhou Yu and Gao Haidong for their invaluable input on the whole project.
Thanks for the funding support from M3 lab, Department of Life Science and Office of Academic Affairs of Nanjing University, who provided the laboratory and required material involved in the experiments of our project. Thank NJU Advanced Institution for Life Science and Jiangsu Engineering Center for MicroRNA Biology and Technology for the technical support. Thank Nanjing Drum-tower Hospital and Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital for providing the opportunity of human practice.
