Attributions
We would like to sincerely thank everyone that has been involved with our project since its inception, contributing to its eventual completion. Throughout each step of the process we’ve been lucky to have had amazing support and guidance.
Special thanks to
Dr George Wadhams
Dr Wadhams has been central to the design and execution of the project from the very beginning, giving advice on wetlab and construct design, in addition to experimental approach.
Dr Chris Jones
Dr Jones has been hugely helpful to the students in the wet lab, teaching us how to use all the lab equipment and patiently answering our many day-to-day questions. His ability to explain protocols in an understanding way has allowed us to develop our lab skills considerably over the course of the summer.
Professor Judy Armitage
Professor Armitage generously allowed us to come into her lab for the summer, to complete the project under her supervision.
Professor Anthony Watts
Professor Watts has provided us with sponsorship support and has acted as our primary contact with the Biochemistry Department, specifically in relation to securing facilities and equipment.
Professor Antonis Papachristodoulou
Professor Papachristodoulou has provided us with guidance with respect to our modelling section. He has always been there to point us in the right direction and suggest new areas to explore.
Thomas Folliard
Tom has provided us with advice, particularly with respect to our plate reader experiments and cloning. His suggestions on how we might improve the efficiency of our cloning procedure were invaluable. He also provided us with a basic form of pCusC.
Harrison Steel
Harrison has provided crucial insights into understanding the data from plate reader experiments and also suggesting ways in which we might improve the our procedures. His past experience as an iGEM team member has also provided insights into how to get the most out of the competition.
James Scott-Brown
James has helped us develop our deterministic models and has been a key helper in trouble shooting our code. He also helped us analyse the data from the plate reader experiments.
Also thanks to
Dr Garry Brown
Dr Brown gave the initial lecture that acted as the seed for our idea, and was happy to meet with us and discuss his experience with Wilson’s Disease. This guided the initial development of our project.
Professor Kevin Foster
Professor Foster provided us with valuable advice on our chassis and chelator choices. He also advised us on how we might make the bacteria persist for as long as possible in the small intestine.
Professor Jane Kaye
Professor Kaye acted as a springboard for the ethics and public engagement sections of our human practices, highlighting that policy is often dependent on public perception.
Valerie Wheater and the Wilson’s Disease Support Group (WDSG)
Valerie Wheater and the WDSG have been incredibly useful to our project, guiding us from the beginning with their thoughts on various aspects of our project. They invited us to present our project at their AGM and talk to many patients and doctors, which keenly illustrated to us the limitations of current treatments and the lack of rare disease awareness.
Associate Professor Maike Bublitz
Dr Bublitz gave us lots of very helpful advice on protein purification and other techniques we were unfamiliar with.
Cardiff iGEM
Our most sincere gratitude to all those at Cardiff iGEM in particular Rob Newman for setting up the collaboration, Dr. Geraint Parry for setting up the experiment and Dr. Anthony Hayes at the bioimaging unit measuring the our parts using the FLIM microscope. This took considerable time and expense for which we are very grateful.
Crowd Funders and Sponsors
Thank you to our kind Crowdfunders and sponsors for enabling us to have such a great summer!
