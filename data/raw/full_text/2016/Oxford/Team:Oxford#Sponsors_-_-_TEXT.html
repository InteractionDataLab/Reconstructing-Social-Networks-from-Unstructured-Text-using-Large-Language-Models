Our Crowdfunders
Sponsors
Our sincerest thanks to everyone who helped to fund our project. Without their support none of what we have achieved would have been possible.
We would also like to thank Professor Anthony Watts for helping us with the financing of the project.
Oxford Biochemistry Department
The University of Oxford Biochemistry Department provided matching funds for our project, and provided us with lab space in which to work and many of the everyday reagents that we required. Financial contributions were also made  by the University of Oxford Departments of Engineering, Physics and Zoology for which we are very grateful. In addition, we were continually aided and guided by members of the Department, especially Drs George Wadhams and Chris Jones on a day-to-day basis, with Professor Judy Armitage, FRS giving her unending support and encouragement, as did all academic and administration members of the Department who hosted and encouraged us.
Vice Chancellor
The Oxford Vice Chancellor, Professor Louise Richardson, kindly provided stipend support from the Vice Chancellors fund, that primarily went towards funding our accommodation and living expenses throughout the summer.
Oxford Colleges
Balliol, Christ Church, Corpus Christi, New, St. Catherine's, St. Edmund Hall, St. Hugh's, St. Hilda's and University colleges assisted in the project through grants to individual team members, or provided discounted accommodation throughout the summer. We would also like to than our tutors for their support, especially when gaining these grants.
Oxford Alumni
Alumni from the Biochemistry Department have been very supportive over the last three years when Oxford has been represented at the iGEM Jamboree. Their input, in kind and financially, as well as listening to our presentations at various events and providing feedback, has been most generous and provided us with much encouragement.
The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, the Society for Experimental Biology, the Society for General Microbiology, the Biochemical Society and the Wellcome trust
In a combined grant, these organisations together funded 50% of the stipends of ten team members at a rate of £180 per week for a 10 week period throughout the project. This money was absolutely essential to the continuation of the iGEM project at Oxford.
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council
The organisation provided one of our team members, Iain Dunn, with a grant which was used to fund his costs, our DNA sequencing and the specialist reagents for our copper assay and chitosan beads.
Gilson UK
Gilson UK kindly provided us a set of P2, P10, P100L pipettes from the Pipetman L Micro Volume range to supplement the few we had access to. This made it so much easier for our team to perform concurrent experiments easily, accurately and efficiently.
Microscope services Ltd
Microscope services is an oxford based company with over 50 years of experience in the sales, service and repair of microscopes, cameras, software and accessories across the UK. The company generously provided financial assistance for our project.
IDT
IDT synthesised all our DNA parts for us and were very quick and helpful in answering all our questions about their DNA synthesis process.
Snapgene
Snapgene allows iGEM teams free access to their software we found invaluable in assembling, our parts in silico and well as explaining them to others.
New England Biolabs
New England Biolabs kindly provided the restriction, polymerase and ligase enzymes and buffers that we needed to assemble of DNA parts.
Crowdfunders
We raised money through crowdfunding which we used to buy our team jumpers for the Jamboree allowing us to look smart and professional.
Our amazing stash on display.
Made with gooood stuff.
