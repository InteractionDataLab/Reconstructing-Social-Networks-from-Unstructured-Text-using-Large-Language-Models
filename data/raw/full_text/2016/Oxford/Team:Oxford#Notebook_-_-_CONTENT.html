Preparation of Stock Solutions
</P><P>gBlocks</P><P>
3 of our gBlocks from IDT had arrived: pCopA MymT HH (pc), MymT sfGFP HH (mg) and TAT Csp1 HH (tc). These arrived in the form of a solid, white powder. We resuspended the gBlocks in different volumes of MilliQ, depending on the weight delivered, to give a stock solution of 10 ng/μl.
</P><P>
Primers. The forward and reverse primers from IDT came as 32.4 nmol and 23.8 nmol of solid respectively. Forward: 5’-CGACTTGATCACGTAGAATTC-3’. Reverse: 5’-ACACGATCGATATAACTGCAGC-3’. For our stock solutions, the primers were suspended in different volumes of MilliQ to give 100μM.
</P><P>
Preparation of reaction solutions. gBlocks: Following resuspension, 10μl of each DNA solution was added to 90μl MilliQ (1:10 dilution) in an Eppendorf to give a final concentration of 1 ng/μl and final solution volume of 100μl.
</P><P>
Primers: Following resuspension, 10μl of each primer solution was added to 90μl MilliQ (1:10 dilution) in an Eppendorf to give a final concentration of 10μM and final solution volume of 100μl.
</P></SECTION><SECTION id="1q2"><H3>Day 2</H3><P>
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). 25μl reactions were run according to the NEB Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix PCR protocol. * 98°C denaturation temperature used due to the high stability of the Q5 polymerase. ** 60°C annealing temperature used on Chris’s recommendation. *** 30s elongation time used as maximum DNA length was 936bp and a PCR takes approximately 20-30s to extend a DNA sequence by 1000bp.
</P><P>
Gel Electrophoresis of PCR-Amplified gBlocks
</P><P>
A 1% agarose gel was prepared according to the agarose gel preparation protocol. 
A DNA ladder mix was prepared in an eppendorf.
The 25μl solutions of PCR-Amplifed gBlocks were mixed with 5μl loading dye in order to visualise their migration. 20μl of this solution was then loaded into each gel well.
The gel was run with a potential difference of 100V applied across the electrodes for approx. 40 minutes.
Following separation, the gel was transferred to a bath of EtBr for staining. It was left shaking for 20 minutes.
Success! The bands produced corresponded to the expected DNA sizes. These were excised using a razor blade and placed in labelled eppendorfs for freezing overnight.
</P><FIGCAPTION>Our first agarose gel :0</FIGCAPTION></SECTION><SECTION id="1q3"><H3>Day 3</H3><P>
Gel extraction of PCR-Amplified gBlocks from agarose gel
</P><P>
The extraction was performed using the Qiagen QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit protocol. 540μl of Buffer QG was added to each tube in 2. In step 9, 30μl MilliQ was used rather than 50μl buffer EB on Chris’s recommendation. The tubes were spun with lids open, hence, they were spun with the lids positioned such that would not flip around during centrifugation, away from the direction of spinning.
</P><P>
Preparation of MymT HH Stock Solution. Another gBlock, MymT HH (m), arrived from IDT and was resuspended as described in Week 1: Day 1. 424ng was delivered, so 42.4μl MilliQ was added to give 10ng/μl.
</P><P>
Preparation of MymT HH reaction solution. Same procedure as Week 1: Day 1.
</P><P>
PCR of MymT. Same program as Week 1: Day 2 used, apart from using a 62°C annealing temperature. gBlocks from yesterday also run to see whether the higher annealing temperature eliminated the smears observed in the PCR from Day 2. 
</P><FIGCAPTION>Less smeary gels
</FIGCAPTION><P>
MymT sfGFP HH and TAT Csp1 ran slightly better under the new conditions. No result from pCopA MymT HH. No template controls run adjacent under same name as DNA produced no result, as expected. MymT HH produced a large smear. Will run again in future.
</P></SECTION><SECTION id="1q4"><H3>Day 4</H3><P>
PCR of MymT
</P><P>
Results: 1) produced a smear. 2) produced a smear. 3) produced nothing.
</P><P>
Restriction Digest of extracted PCR products. Digest of PCR-amplified pCopA MymT HH, MymT sfGFP HH, and TAT Csp1 HH performed using NEB EcoR1-HF and PstI-HF restriction enzymes. CutSmart buffer determined to be the best to use using NEB’s Double Digest Finder. Volume added to make reaction mixture up to 50μl. Incubation at 37°C for 2 hours in a ThermoMixer.
</P></SECTION><SECTION id="1q5"><H3>Day 5</H3><P>
Open day, no wet lab.
</P></SECTION><SECTION id="Suv2"><H2>Week 2 27/06</H2><SECTION id="2q1"><H3>Day 1</H3><P>
PCR of MymT. After no success last week, a new working reaction solution was made up in case the previous reaction solution had been contaminated. Run under new conditions but still a smear over most molecular weights. Carry out again.
</P><P>
PCR, gel extraction and restriction enzyme digest of shipping vector. Using shipping vector from the team last year for our plasmids. Ran a PCR using standard conditions to amplify amount of the vector. Gel Extraction of plasmid using the Qiagen QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit protocol. Restriction enzyme digest of extraction using same protocol as followed in Week 1: Day 4. 10μl of plasmid used instead of 25μl.
</P><P>
Gel extraction of restriction digest incubations. Upon completion of the restriction digest incubation, the gBlocks and the plasmid backbones were purified using the Qiagen QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit protocol. We quantified the amount of DNA using NanoDrop 1ul of water and tissue were initially used to clean the NanoDrop stage. A blank reading was made using 1μl of MilliQ. 1μl of each DNA sample was measured for concentration. The DNA was ligated with the shipping vector and left overnight at 16°C.
</P></SECTION><SECTION id="2q2"><H3>Day 2</H3><P>
Antibiotic stock made. Shipping plasmid contains gene conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, so chloramphenicol antibiotic stock made up. Reaction mixture composed of 300mg chloramphenicol, 0.5ml MilliQ, and 9.5ml ethanol (prevents freezing). After making solution, filter pipette tips used to produce 20 x 0.5ml aliquots of chloramphenicol solution for later use.
</P><P>
Set up agar plates. LB agar melted to produce a pourable liquid. After melting, chloramphenicol from stock solution added at 1:1000 dilution. Plating in flow cupboard. Plates left to set for 30 minutes.
</P><P>
Transformation of <I>E. coli</I> cells with ligated plasmid DNA. Competent <I>E. coli</I> cells removed from freezer at -80°C and thawed on ice. Transformation protocol followed. 2 plates for each DNA sample (MymT sfGFP HH, TAT Csp1 HH, pCopA MymT HH sample 1, and pCopA MymT HH sample 2). First plate produced by spreading 100μl of the cell solution onto one plate. Second plate produced after spinning down the remaining solution and resuspending in LB broth and plating, resulting in a more concentrated plate. Plates left to incubate overnight at 37°C.
</P><P>
Miniprep of CusC. Minipreparation: isolation of plasmid DNA from bacteria. Completed using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit protocol. Resulting solution placed in freezer at -20°C
</P></SECTION><SECTION id="2q3"><H3>Day 3</H3><P>
Growth and Culture of bacteria. Plates incubated overnight all contain colonies. More are present on the concentrated plates. 2 colonies from each plate are selected (not too large or too small) and incubated in test tubes with 5ml LB broth and chloramphenicol in 37°C shaker overnight. Aim of the procedure is to increase the number of plasmids containing our biobricks.
</P><P>
PCR of MymT HH was unsuccessful again.
</P><P>
Preparation of pCopA TAT Csp1 sfGFP HH (ptcg) Stock Solution. Another gBlock, pCopA TAT Csp1 sfGFP HH, arrived from IDT and was resuspended as described in Week 1: Day 1. 1000ng was delivered, so 100μl MilliQ was added to give 10ng/μl.

Miniprepped pg and fck, ran a gel and digested. pg had expected bands so both sent for sequencing but fck did not have the expected bands. Picked more pCusCRFP and fck colonies. Ligated some more fck colonies. SDS-PAGE of mg and cg and gfp.
</P></SECTION><SECTION id="15q2"><H3>Day 2</H3><P>
Both pg sequences unsuccessful. Miniprepped fck and pCusCRFP colonies, digested and ran a gel but none of them had the expected bands. Transformed the new fck ligations.
</P></SECTION><SECTION id="15q3"><H3>Day 3</H3><P>
Picked colonies from the transformed fck plates. Started fck and pCusCRFP from PCR again because past performance suggests it won’t work anyway.
</P></SECTION><SECTION id="15q4"><H3>Day 4</H3><P>
Miniprepped fck, digested and run on a gel, ONE OF THEM HAD THE RIGHT BAND! Sent this for sequencing. pCusCRFP colonies did not grow so pCusCRFP was transformed again. Denaturation Gel.
</P></SECTION><SECTION id="15q5"><H3>Day 5</H3><P>
SEQUENCING FOR FCK WAS (very nearly: Val to Ala point mutation) SUCCESSFUL AT LAST! pCusCRFP plates were moved to the cold room.
</P></SECTION><SECTION id="15q7"><H3>Day 7</H3><P>
Colonies were picked from pCusCRFP
</P></SECTION><SECTION id="Suv16"><H2>Week 16 3/10</H2><SECTION id="16q1"><H3>Day 1</H3><P>
pCusCRFP was miniprepped, digested and sent for sequencing.
</P></SECTION><SECTION id="16q2"><H3>Day 2</H3><P>
Sequencing for pCusCRFP came back successfully. Both fck and pCusCRFP were transformed into MG1655.
</P></SECTION><SECTION id="Interlab"><H2>Interlab</H2><H3>Day 1</H3><P>
Transformed the 5 interlab parts into DH5α as per the transformation protocol.	
</P><H3>Day 2</H3><P>
Transformations mostly unsuccessful.
Started making new competent cells.
</P><H3>Day 3</H3><P>
Second day of competent cell preparation, cells frozen and put in the freezer.
</P><H3>Day 4</H3><P>
LB media preparation and re-transformation of the interlab parts.
</P><H3>Day 5</H3><P>
Had colonies from all interlab parts except PC. Picked colonies from all successful plates. Retransformed PC.
</P><H3>Day 6</H3><P>
PC didn't transform again. After measuring the sample we were sent with nanodrop we found the sample has no DNA in it. Requested a second sample from iGEM HQ
Nevertheless we did a third transformation for PC.
NC and TD1-3 were miniprepped and sent for sequencing.
</P><H3>Day 7</H3><P>
TD1 sequencing successful, others had the wrong part in so retransformed these. PC colonies successful despite nanodrop so picked colonies for these.
</P><H3>Day 8</H3><P>
PC miniprepped, digested and sent for sequencing. Colonies picked for re-transformed TD2, TD3 and NC.
</P><H3>Day 9</H3><P>
PC sequencing unsuccessful. TD2, TD3 and NC miniprepped and sent for sequencing.
</P><H3>Day 10</H3><P>
TD2 sequencing successful, others not. PC, NC and TD3 transformed again
</P><H3>Day 11</H3><P>
PC, NC and TD3 colonies picked.
</P><H3>Day 12</H3><P>
PC, NC and TD3 miniprepped and sent for sequencing.
</P><H3>Day 13</H3><P>
NC and TD3 sequencing successful but PC wrong so retransformed again.
</P><H3>Day 14</H3><P>
Picked colonies for PC.
</P><H3>Day 15</H3><P>
PC was miniprepped and digested. Gel showed it contained the wrong part so we transformed the part from the distribution kit instead.
</P><H3>Day 16</H3><P>
Colonies picked for PC.
</P><H3>Day 17</H3><P>
PC miniprepped, digested and sent for sequencing.
Produced more competent cells.
</P><H3>Day 18</H3><P>
PC sequencing correct!
All 5 interlab parts were transformed into MG1655
</P><H3>Day 19</H3><P>
Made the calibration curves for the OD600 and the FITC standard curve
Colonies picked for all the interlab parts.
</P><H3>Day 20</H3><P>
Tested iGEM's protocol for the OD600 and the fluorescence. Picked more colonies for all 5 parts.
</P><H3>Day 21</H3><P>
Repeated iGEM's protocol and started Oxford iGEM's protocol.
</P><H3>Day 22</H3><P>
Finished Oxford iGEM's protocol and submitted the data obtained using iGEM's method to iGEM
