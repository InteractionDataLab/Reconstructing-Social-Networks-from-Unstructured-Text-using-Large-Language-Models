Composite Parts
Here is a list of all our composite parts. For our project they consist of our copper chelators under control of the divergent CueR-pCopA copper sensitive promoter system.  More details are provided on our main parts page.
pCopA TAT Csp1 sfGFP with divergent expressed CueR ( BBa_K1980010 )
pCopA MymT with plasmid divergent expressed CueR ( BBa_K1980011 )
pCopA MymT sfGFP with divergent expressed CueR ( BBa_K1980012 )
Made with gooood stuff.
