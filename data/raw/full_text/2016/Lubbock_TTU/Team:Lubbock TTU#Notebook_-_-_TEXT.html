JANUARY - JUNE
Start of iGEM!
 January 2016 - May 2016
The TTU Raider Research Team began member recruitment and team selection for the 2016 iGEM competition. Members began discussions on synthetic biology literature and identified a potential project to pursue. Full time and part time researchers were identified. Start of fundraising.
iGEM Bootcamp - Day 1
 June 3rd, 2016
On the first day of iGEM Bootcamp, team members were given commitment forms, discussed individual schedules, and were assigned teaching roles for the following day. Members began to design a fundraising brochure, created a timeline of our goals, sent out thank you letters to sponsors, and brainstormed ideas for fundraising, human practices, and future discussions with actors and regulators. Members who were assigned a teaching role began to work on their powerpoint presentations.
iGEM Bootcamp - Day 2
 June 4th, 2016
On the second day of iGEM Bootcamp, an "Introduction to Biology" presentation was given by iGEM members Ellen Wilson and Cody Fell; DNA structure, DNA replication, information flow (central dogma), the genetic code, mutations, proteins, transcriptional control, translational control, RNA regulation, Bio-engineering, and more were reviewed to accommodate members studying other STEM fields. An "Introduction to Model Organisms and Microbial Interactions" presentation was given by members Zachary Nguyen and Alejandra Duran; history strains, growth and maintenance, plasmids, transformations, and etc were covered. Following lunch, an "Introduction to Synthetic Biology and iGEM" presentation was given by members Holden Fried and Brandon Palomo; history, DNA parts and assembly, circuits, standard registry, BioBrick design, methods, and technology were covered. The last presentation of the day, "Research and Basic Lab Review", was given by members Marilyn Mathew and Gregory Knox, which covered how to search and read a scientific paper, keep a notebook, and stay organized; assignments, required safety training, BLAST and Ape, and other programs algorithms and programs we covered. Wrap up discussions completed the second day of iGEM training.
iGEM Bootcamp - Day 3
 June 5th, 2016
On the final day of iGEM Bootcamp, team members Aric Denton, Gregory Knox, and Marilyn Mathew led an "Introduction to Lab Techniques" for the other members. Restriction digest-ligation, cloning and PCR, primer design, and flow cytometry were discussed. Members received a hands-on lesson over mini prepping, inoculation, transformation recap, gel electrophoresis, how to pour plates, and DNA assembly methods.
ULabs Outreach
 June 17th, 2016
The Lubbock_TTU team met up at ULabs Makerspace for the "Fun Day of Science" outreach event to teach young students about synthetic biology. Several experiments were conducted.

Week One
 June 20th - June 26th, 2016
Wet Lab team obtained access badges to the Department of Cell Physiology and Molecular Biophysics. Members identified sequences for PDGF-BB and other cytokines and began to learn how to clone in the lab. Protocols associated with construction of the genetic design were identified and discussed with an instructor. Dry Lab team finished refining sponsorship packet and assigned members departments and companies to contact. Members began engineering a scaffold design: literature sources and components to make or buy for scaffold were discussed. Design of bioreactor began: literature sources and components to make or buy for bioreactor designs also discussed.
Dry Lab Meeting
 June 27th, 2016
Dry Lab team met to discuss design of scaffold and bioreactor. Members brainstormed materials needed for "Hackerspace" outreach and possible themes for Lubbock_TTU wiki page.
