Proof of Concept
By partnering a bioreactor with our Kil protein secretion method, we will be able to purify large quantities of DsbA tagged therapeutic protein from the supernatant in a continuous flow through process. This efficient protein purification protocol is essential for producing the amount of protein needed for testing. In addition, the western blot helped us to confirm the identity of our purified PDGF-B protein. View our data here.
