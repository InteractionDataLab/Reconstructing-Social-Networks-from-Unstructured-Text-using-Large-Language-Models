About Us
The Lubbock_TTU Team is part of a student organization at Texas Tech University known as iGEM Raiders. Our mission is to expose the university and community to synthetic biology through undergraduate initiative and involvement in the International Genetically Engineering Machine (iGEM) Competition. This year, the iGEM Raiders team is composed of 12 dedicated undergraduate and graduate students with backgrounds in microbiology, animal science, cell and molecular biology, biochemistry, mathematics, physics, and chemical, mechanical, and electrical engineering. The diversity within our team enables the iGEM Raiders to tackle novel project ideas.
