Medal Criteria
We're very proud of all of our accomplishments during this project!
Bronze
We registered for iGEM, worked throughout the winter and spring here in South Africa, and will present our work at the Giant Jamboree in Boston!
We have established a comprehensive wiki of our project. Check out our Parts and Safety pages among others.
Check out our Attributions page for information on all those involved in the progress on our project.
We documented a number of new BioBricks, among them BBa_K2037002 encoding a laccase gene from Eucalyptus grandis. Check out our Parts page to read more about our parts!
Silver
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
We collaborated with three different teams in the 2016 iGEM season - Macquarie, Aix-Marseille, and Heidelberg. Check out our Collaborations page for more information.
We took the opportunity to engage with a number of industrial partners in the energy sector, and developed synthetic biology skills at our university, among other things. Check out our Human Practices - Silver page for more information.
Gold
During our project we gained valuable knowledge from experts in the field who alerted us to ways in which we can better apply synthetic biology in our project to avoid the release of genetically modified organisms. Check out our Human Practices - Gold page to read more about how we adjusted our project to address these issues.
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry.
