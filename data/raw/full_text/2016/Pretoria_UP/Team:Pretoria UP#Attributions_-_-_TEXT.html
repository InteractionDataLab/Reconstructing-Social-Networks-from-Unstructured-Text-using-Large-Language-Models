The Pretoria_UP team would like to extend special thanks to the numerous people and organizations that supported us throughout this project. We could not have done this without you.
Team members
Brad: Lab: Extraction and isolation of thylakoids, visualisation of thylakoid binding. Helped with work on laccases. Human Practices: Interview with Dr. Karen Surridge-Talbot, presented at the synthetic biology symposium.
Simon: Designed and assembled graphene electrodes and measuring PBEC cell performance in terms of current per surface area.
Thabang: Human practices: Arranged interview with Dr Karen Surridge-Talbot, attended synthetic biology workshop, presented at synthetic biology symposium, women in energy business summit, UP with science, presented at SANEDI. Lab work: worked on laccases, SP6 and T7. Collaborations: helped with documentary for iGEM  Aix Marseille University. Contributed to wiki content.
Ricu: Performed preliminary  graphene wash and elution experiments. Involved in creating and cloning several biobricks. Helped activate the PEM. Entered parts into the registry and involved with characterizing the biobricks. Helped in demonstrating that a prototype of our project works. Presented at the UP with science presentation. Helped with Wiki content.
Vaughn: Came up with the PBEC project idea. Performed SELEX experiments for graphene including asymmetric PCR optimization, graphene wash and elution optimization, as well as running the actual experiment to identify graphene specific aptamers. Identified appropriate target site in photosystem II for aptamer binding, and worked with team Heidelberg 2015 to design the aptamer for this target site using MAWS. Helped in creating the laccase BioBricks. Helped activate the PEM. Helped make and characterize the laccase biobricks and improving the characterisation of a previous device. Helped in demonstrating that a prototype of our project works. Organised the UP with science presentation for our team. Presented at the synthetic biology symposium. Helped with Wiki content.
Maryn: Created the simulation model of the PBEC using AnyLogic software. Made a GoPro video of our project using Adobe Premiere Elements. Human Practices: UP with science presentation. Presented at the synthetic biology symposium.
Stephan: Human Practices: Tuks FM interview, SANEDI interview, Interview with Dr Karen, SANEDI Presentation and UP with science presentation. Designed, manufactured and assembled PBEC containment unit. Help with collaboration with Macquarie. Helped activate PEM.
Nomakula: Human practices: TuksFM interview, SANEDI presentation, Women in Energy Summit Interview with Dr. Karen Surridge-Talbot, organised synthetic biology symposium presented at the synthetic biology symposium and #FeesMustFall article. Collaboration: All survey collaborations and Aix Marseille University documentary. Lab: worked on laccases, T7 and SP6. Helped on Wiki content
Modjadji: Human practices: TuksFM interview, SANEDI presentation, Women in Energy Summit, Interview with Dr. Karen Surridge-Talbot, presented at the synthetic biology symposium. Collaboration: Helped with the Aix Marseille University documentary. Lab: worked on laccases  and SP6. Helped on Wiki content
Bernard: Worked on the collaboration with the Macquarie team and helped with the UP with Science presentation. Helped in the lab with plasmid extractions and other protocols involved with the laccases. I also helped with the initial graphene washings and microcopy of thylakoid binding. Helped with the Wiki.
Pieter: Wiki design, development, and coordination. Presentation design. Logo design. Branding representative. Project description video director and editor. Aix Marseille University documentary videography.
