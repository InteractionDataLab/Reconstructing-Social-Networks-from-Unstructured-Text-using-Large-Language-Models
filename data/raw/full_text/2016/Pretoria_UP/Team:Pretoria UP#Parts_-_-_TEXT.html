Basic Parts
We added 5 new basic parts. An SP6 promoter which can be used for in vitro expression of genes, as well as 4 eukaryotic Laccase proteins from Eucalyptus grandis.
K2037000 : An promoter from bacteriophage SP6 that is recognised by an SP6 RNA Polymerase. This part can aid in in vitro expression of various genes.
K2037001 : Laccase 'EucgrA01282' protein from Eucalyptus grandis with a His (x6) tag after the start codon.
K2037002 : Laccase 'EucgrB02797' protein from Eucalyptus grandis with His(x6) tag after start codon.
K2037003 : Laccase 'EucgrG03098' protein from Eucalyptus grandis with His (x6) tag after start codon.
K2037004 : Laccase 'EucgrF02641' protein from Eucalyptus grandis with His (x6) tag after start codon.
Composite Parts
We designed and added 12 new composite parts to the registry. Four eukaryotic laccase genes from Eucalyptus grandis, as well eight prokaryotic laccase genes, all of which has an SP6 promoter and a His(x6) tag at the 5’ end and a T7 terminator at the 3’ end.
K2037005 : SP6 promoter attached to Laccase 'EucgrA01282' protein sequence with a His (6x) tag after the start codon. T7 terminator at the end.
K2037006 : SP6 promoter attached to Laccase 'EucgrB02797' protein sequence with a His (6x) tag after the start codon. T7 terminator at the end.
K2037007 : SP6 promoter attached to Laccase 'EucgrG03098' protein sequence with a His (6x) tag after the start codon. T7 terminator at the end.
K2037008 : SP6 promoter attached to Laccase 'EucgrF02641' protein sequence with a His (6x) tag after the start codon. T7 terminator at the end.
K2037009 : SP6 promoter attached to Laccase from Bacillus pumilus with His(6x) tag. T7 terminator at the end.
K2037010 : SP6 promoter attached to Laccase from Bacillus pumilus with His(6x) tag. T7 terminator at the end.
K2037012 : Part K863005 with an SP6 promoter added as well as a T7 terminator.
K2037013 : Part K863006 with an SP6 promoter added as well as a T7 terminator.
K2037014 : SP6 promoter joined to a tthl laccase from Thermus thermophilus with T7 promoter, RBS and His-tag.
K2037015 : SP6 promoter Joined to tthl laccase from Thermus thermophiles and a T7 terminator.
K2037016 : SP6 promoter combined with bhal laccase from Bacillus halodurans with T7 promoter, RBS and His-tag and a T7 terminator.
K2037017 : SP6 promoter joined to bhal laccase from Bacillus halodurans joined to a T7 terminator.
Improved Characterization of a Part
Two parts were chosen to improve the characterization. Both of these parts code for laccase proteins and were lacking a thorough characterization in the registry.
BBa_K863010 : tthl (Laccase from Thermus thermophilus) with T7, RBS and HIS tag.
BBa_K863020 : bhal laccase from Bacillus halodurans with T7 and HIS.
