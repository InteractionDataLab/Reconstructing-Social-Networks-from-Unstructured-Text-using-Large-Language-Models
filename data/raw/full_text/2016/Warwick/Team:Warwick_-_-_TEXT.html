Application of CRISPR/Cas9 as a novel modular biosensor
CRISPR/Cas9
Biosensor.
Using a dCas9 protein and an RNA-binding protein (RBP) fused to an effector, transcription of a fluorescent reporter gene can be regulated, with a significant colour change indicating the presence of targeted RNA.
Leptospirosis Impact and Diagnosis.
Our project will enable diagnosis of the disease at an early stage, increasing the likelihood of successful treatment and reducing the risk of irreversible bodily damage.
Pollutant Detection: Heavy Metal Ions.
Our team has developed a system capable of detecting these ions in water sources, potentially improving the quality of human life on a global scale, in an inexpensive easily accessible manner.
