MEMBERS
Our team is made up of 9, below is a brief description of their roles, contributions to the project
Liam Carroll  
I'm a second year Bio-Med student at Warwick University and my interest in natural sciences and genomics, the mechanisms of the human body led me to believe thatthis would be the most dynamic and exciting project for me! I spend my spare time being constantly animated by pokemon, eating rice and abusing my team members.
Konstantina Koteva
I'm a fourth year Maths and Physics Student whose focus is on genetic alogorothmsfor modelling and optimisation, but my enjoyment of these fields in no way limits my passion for areas such as dancing and spending as much time as possible with my friends and family.
Hayden Tobin
As a 1st year Chemistry student Hayden is learning new and enhancing old skills byhelping in multiple aspects of the project. This ranges from working in the lab, advancing the content of the wiki and deriving some of the mathematics required for computational modelling.  He enjoys making puns and 'dad' jokes in the labs but in his spare time Hayden has a keen interest in shooting, flying and has the aim of travelling the world to see every country he can.
Chinwe Odili
I'm a second year Engineering student at Warwick Univerisity , 'to Engineer isHuman' and I thought why not delve into a field that I am completely new in and apply my technical skills , exploring modelling or even building a website in greater depth! My passions include listening to my vinyls, sketching , painting and writing.
Egheosa Ogbomo
I'm a second year Engineering student at Warwick University, I love Physics so nosurprises my role has been somewhat invested in solving equations based on the Physics of Biological Materials and looking at Modelling to some degree. Outside of the labs, I find myself fascinated in culture and exploration of archeological findings while travelling!
 Anjana Supamaniam
I'm a second year Biomed student, I thought why not be part of something thatrevolutionizes the way we think in a subject area that is a burning passion of mine functional genomics! I love to keep active whether its travelling , playing volleyball or aiming a petri dish at a team member.
Robert Richardson
I'm a third year Chemistry student , I found myself fully engaged in nearly allBiology modules on  my course by implication this seemed like a not only logical but exciting way to spend my Summer!Alongside eating salt.
 Isobel Holden
I'm a 3rd year Chemical biologist who is looking to improve my skills in wet anddry biology labs whilst gaining more experience on the human aspects of the applications of science. I am also very interested in History, Art and architecture  and I can't bear to be without Music so no silent labs when I'm around!
