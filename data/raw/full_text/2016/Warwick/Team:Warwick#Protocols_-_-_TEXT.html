DIGESTION
1. Prepare the following in separate PCR tubes for all samples requiring digestion:
The restriction enzyme used is dependent on the cut sites present on the template DNA and the purpose of the digestion. Triple digestions can be completed with an additional restriction enzyme if necessary. When used for diagnostic purposes, the solution is made up to 20 µl instead of 50 µL.
This is then incubated in a thermocycler at 37 °C for one hour (the samples can be incubated for longer depending on the star activity of the restriction enzymes).

GROWING COMPETENT CELLS
Main step 1: Growing electrocompetent cells
1. Add 200 ml LB media into a 1 l Erlenmeyer flask.
2. Add 200 µl antibiotic into the Erlenmeyer flask.
3. Measure the optical density (OD) of cells grown overnight in the 15 ml Falcon tube. OD of 1 for E. coli means 108 number of cells.
4. We want to have OD of 0.01 in the Erlenmeyer flask at the start of the experiment.
5. Place the Erlenmeyer flask in the incubator at 37 °C with 300 RPM (cover the opening of the flask with foil).
6. Be very careful of the cells OD in the Erlenmeyer flask. The best OD range for the electrocompetent cell is 0.4 to 0.6. Therefore, at least 2 times sampling and measuring cells OD is necessary to monitor the exponential increase in the cells OD. It usually takes ~3 hours for electrocompetent cells growing at 37 °C to reach OD of 0.5.
Main step 2: Harvesting electrocompetent cells
1. Turn on the centrifuge and keep its temperature cool at 4 °C.
2. Take the cells out of the incubator when OD reaches 0.4-0.6 (caution needed).
3. Transfer the electrocompetent cells to 4 x 50 ml Falcon tubes while keeping the Falcon tubes in ice water.
4. Place the Falcon tubes in the centrifuge and spin down (4000 RPM, 15 mins, 4 °C).
5. Pour out supernatant quickly and be careful of cell pellets.
6. While keeping the tubes in ice water, gently resuspend (DO NOT VORTEX) the cell pellets in each Falcon tube with 25 ml 10% glycerol.
7. Transfer the 4 x 25 ml of solution from the 4 x 50 ml Falcon tubes into 2 x 50 ml Falcon tubes (keep them cold).
8. Place the Falcon tubes in the centrifuge and spin down again (4000 RPM, 15 min, 4 °C).
9. Pour out supernatant quickly and be careful of cell pellets.
10. While keeping the tubes in ice water, gently resuspend the cell pellets in each Falcon tube using 25 ml 10% glycerol.
11. Transfer the 2 x 25 ml of solution from the 2 x 50 ml Falcon tubes into the 1 x 50 ml Falcon tube (keep it cold).
12. Place the Falcon tube in the centrifuge, along with a balance tube of water, and spin down again (4000 RPM, 15 min, 4 °C).
13. Pour out the supernatant quickly and be careful of cell pellets.
14. While keeping tubes in ice water, gently resuspend the cell pellets in the Falcon tube in 2 ml of 20% glycerol.
15. In the cold room, aliquot ~55 µl of cells into as many 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes as possible and as fast as possible.
