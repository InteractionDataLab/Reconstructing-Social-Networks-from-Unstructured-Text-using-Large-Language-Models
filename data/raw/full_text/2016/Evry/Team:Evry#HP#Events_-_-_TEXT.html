iGEM Events: meeting other participants
The European Experience
During this year's edition of iGEM, the team Évry has had the opportunity to co-organize a big European meet-up, with iGEM IONIS, and to attend to a regional Ile-de-France meet-up celebrated in Paris, organized by iGEM Pasteur and iGEM Paris Saclay.
The European Experience
On the 2nd and 3rd of July, our iGEM team coorganized the European Experience with iGEM IONIS team. This event allowed to gather more than 150 iGEMers with about 30 teams coming from 11 different countries in all Europe. All the teams were able to present their projecs, as well as share ideas and explore new possibilities for collaborations. We have dedicated a webpage to it here .
Ile de France meet-up
The 6th of August, we attended the Ile de France Meet-up. This fantastic meeting was performed at the Pasteur Institute and organized by iGEM Pasteur and iGEM Paris Saclay. Several Teams including ours presented their project in front of general public and judges, who gave feedback on it. Demonstration of a Drone was performed and garden picnic allowed to tighten the link between iGEMers in the Parisian area.
