</P><P>The drip chamber ensures that for each drop that goes out within the Reactor 3, one drop will be drawn into the drip chamber from an upper reservoir (not shown, see Figure 6). This allows a constant flow (see violet liquid in the bioprocess) that is going to be regulated by means of the Flow regulators 1 and 2, without the need to calculate exact values of height (H) (see section Testing flows), just by providing more-than-enough potential energy and using flow regulators (see Figure 2 and Figure 6). </P><P>Once a steady flow is obtained at the values of interest, the cells grown in the Bioreactor 1 and 2 can be grown in steady state, thus simplifying variant parameters for the engineered strain. The outflow out from the Bioreactor 2 will go straight to the Reactor 3, where a cell lysis agent can be provided and make this Reactor 3 as a vessel for enzymatic extension, although other chemical methods for extension of the polymeric chain can be considered as well here. According to the flow of interest, this Reactor 3 is not run in continuous, but is run in a fed-batch fashion. Here, the time required to fill this vessel, according to the flows stated in the Table 3 is around 4 days. This way, reactions within this vessel can be held during this time before further clean up and processing. </P><P>Finally, if successful, the plastic product could be purified and it could be melted and extruded in the DIY-PLA-extruder designed for such purpose, with the help of a heater. This heater should be used at a specific distance from the extruder to ensure that the melting temperatures are optimal. At the end, by using the piston to push the melted material in the extruder, a filament of raw plastic should be able to be ejected from the extruder and stored in the roller (see Figure 4).

In this type of bioreactor, once steady state has been reached, the <I>specific growth rate</I> (µ) of microorganisms can be controlled, as demonstrated in the following mass balance of eq.1, by varying the speed with which substrate enters the tank.</P><P>The steady flow (F) allows a system of a fixed volume (V) to achieve an steady state where accumulation or leakage of biomass in the system over time is null, that is dM/dt = 0; thus allowing cells to grow at a fixed specific growth rate (μ) for the achievement of a fixed value of biomass concentration (x) over time (t) that will be regulated according to the dilution time (D = F/V), following the behaviour presented in the biomass balance described in eq.2.</P><P>As explained above, in a continuous system, if steady state, dM/dt= 0; then, </P><P>Together with the consideration of a sterile supply of LB media from the bag, and considering no bacterial cell growth in the tubes that go from the <I>chemostat</I> to the <I>cellstat</I>.

This siphoning can be theoretically described using Bernoulli’s equation (eq.4):</P><P>Where P is pressure, ρ is density of the fluid, g is gravitational acceleration, h is height difference between input and output, and V is velocity of the fluid. </P></DIV><DIV><P>In the drip chamber, fluid flow is basically driven by pressure difference; therefore, the surface of both the upper reservoir and lower end of the tube were considered as atmospheric pressure. Therefore, neglecting the values regarding pressure to measure the velocity of fluid it can be rearranged as follows:</P><P>Here, the fluid velocity is completely determined by the height (H), which is calculated by the difference in the height between the surface of the upper reservoir (the level of LB media liquid in the IV perfusion chambers) and the lower end of the output tube in the bioreactor. By using eq.5, and taking into account the area (A) of the tube, the flow rate (F) can be calculated by using the eq.6 below:</P><P>Therefore, is demonstrated the principle by which this flow rate was adjustable through alteration of the the height (H) between the upper chamber (LB reservoir) and the output (the bioreactor), only by the height of bioreactor respective to the fixed liquid level of the IV perfusion chambers. If not for the drip chamber the flow would be decreasing over time as soon as the volume level of the LB reservoir (the bag) drops.</P><P>Following these principles, the pump was settled to pump a the first two chemostats in series in order to operate the two first steps of the system presented in the Figure 2.</P><P>Nevertheless, following practical application of these principles, and to ease the use of the bioreactor for ensuring that the rate is steady and durable over time, a “safe and sure” approach was used, taking into account the laws described above where it is stated that only height (H) in the drip chamber is affecting flow rate (F). </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="grid-2"><DIV><P> This “safe and sure” approach relies in the Flow regulators (tube closures/screws) that were provided with the IV perfusion sets (see Figure 2 and Figure 6) and the chemostats/bioreactors.  These flow taps/screws can regulate the flow by being lidded, and by using a value of height (H) much higher than the minimum required for the system to have enough potential energy to be pumped at the velocity of interest. This secured height threshold (H<SUB>threshold</SUB> = H<SUB>min</SUB> + <I>security threshold</I>) between the reservoir out of the LB media bag  and the chemostat, can thus be regulated exclusively by screwing partially the taps and counting the output flow. For instance, also without the need of comparing experimental and theoretical values for the online regulation of the flow.</P><P>Since a flow of ~0.42 mL/min is the one used for the experiments, a flow rate of &gt; 1mL / min was considered safe to ensure that potential energy necessary for pumping (by means of height H) was more than enough so that it can be regulated by screwing the taps. For testing this, with the taps completely open (i.e. without narrowing the taps) a secure height of H = 66 cm for the perfusion set respective to the output tube was ensured, and flow rates regulated by only screwing the taps, flow rates were tested by using a test tube of 100 mL (H0 = 21 cm) and counting the time it does take to fill a particular volume. Time was recorded every 10-20 mL and a mean value was taken as a flow rate. </P></DIV><DIV><P>Here a particular example:</P><P>
