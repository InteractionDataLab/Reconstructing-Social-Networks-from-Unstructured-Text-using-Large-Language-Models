Preparation of competent E. coli bacteria for heat shock
WORK UNDER STERILE CONDITIONS
Launch a pre-culture of the strain in LB at 37 °C
Inoculate 25 mL of LB 1/50 with the pre-culture
Let it rise to 37 °C with stirring until DO = 0.5-0.7
In the spectrophotometer use LB medium as blank
Cool the cells 10 min on ice
Centrifuge the culture 6 min at 4000 rpm at 4 °C
Throw away the flow-through
Take the pellet in 1/2 volume of cold CaCl2 0.1 M
Cool the cells 20 min on ice
Centrifuge the culture 6 min at 4000 rpm at 4 °C
Throw away the flow-through
Resuspend the pellet in 1/50e volume of cold CaCl2 + 10 % glycerol
Aliquote 50 µL in Eppendorf 1.5 mL tubes
Store samples on ice for immediate use or freeze 50 µl aliquots in -80 °C
 
Transformation by heat shock (E. coli)
Thaw 50 µL bacteria (E. coli DH5-alpha) chemo-competent
Add 2 µL DNA (mix ligation)
Incubation 20 min on ice
Heat shock: 45 s at 42 °C
Incubation 3 min on ice
Add 450 µL LB
Incubation 1 h at 37 °C with shaking
Centrifugation 2 min at 7000 rpm
Throw away supernatant
Resuspension with 100 µL LB medium
Spread on plates LB-agar with appropriate concentration of antibiotic(s)
Preparation of competent P. putida bacteria for electroporation
Set a 5 mL preculture of putida KT2440 in LB
Incubate overnight at 30 °C with shaking
Inoculate 60 mL of LB with 1 mL of preculture
Incubate at 30 °C with stirring until OD(600nm)=0.6-0.8
Divide the culture into proper sized tubes
Harvest cells by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 6 min, 4 °C). Discard the supernatant
Resuspended the pellet in ice-cold 5 mL HEPES (1 mM)/10 mL culture.
Centrifugation 4000 rpm, 6 min, 4 °C
Discard the supernatant.
Resuspended the pellet in ice-cold 5 mL HEPES (1 mM)/10 mL of culture.
Centrifugation 4000 rpm, 6 min, 4 °C
Discard the supernatant.
Resuspended the pellet in 100 µL HEPES 1 mM, 10 % glycerol (20 µL glycerol 66 % per 100 µL of HEPES)/10 mL of culture
Store the cells at -80 °C.
Transformation by electroporation (P. putida)
Electroporate 50 µL of cells with 100 ng DNA at 1800V
Add 1 mL of LB
Incubate 1 h at 30 °C with shaking (for putida for other species use optimal growth temperature)
Plate on selective LB-agar

Digestion and ligation were performed by using NEB enzymes with their corresponding protocols. For more information, refer to the official NEB website ( digestion or ligation )
 
Gibson assembly
The NEB protocol was followed to performed Gibson assembly.

GenElute Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Sigma, PLN350-1KT) was used to perform miniprep of plasmid DNA from precultures of bacteria (E. coli).
DNA clean & concentrator-5 kit (#D4003S Zymo Research) or DNA PCR clean-up kit (NEB) were used to purified the DNA fragment or vectors after digestion.
 
DNA Gel extraction kit (#T1020G NEB) or Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (D4001S ZymoResearch) were used to extract DNA from agarose gel after migration.
