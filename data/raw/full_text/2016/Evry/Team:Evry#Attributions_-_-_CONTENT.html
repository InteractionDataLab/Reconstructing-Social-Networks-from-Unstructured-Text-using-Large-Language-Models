By getting motivation and advices from ex-iGEMers, the team quickly started doing weekly Journal Clubs - to speak about science and share synthetic biology knowledge. Later, it expanded to third-year students in Life Sciences and Bioinformatics, and a student in Law. On January, the Brainstorming session started, organized solely by the students. In late March, and after several project discussions, the &quot;Let's PLAy&quot; idea was presented to researchers on the Institute of Systems &amp; Synthetic Biology (iSSB) in Evry, and was finally chosen. From that point on, we kept designing the project and the real wet-lab work started at the beginning of July. </P><P>Ideas development, lab work, modeling and human practices have all been conceived and done by the team members, with the help of two advisors.</P><DIV id="attributions"><H2 class="yellow">Project task distribution</H2><DIV class="grid-2"><DIV><H4> Wet Lab</H4><P><UL><LI> Cloning experiments for <I>E. coli</I> were performed by <B>Charlotte</B>, <B>Delphine</B>, <B>Jonathan</B>, <B>Mounia</B>, supervised by <B>Cécile</B>. </LI><LI> Cloning experiments for <I>P. putida</I> were performed by <B>Robert</B> and <B>Vincent</B>. </LI><LI> The Interlab study was done by <B>Vincent</B> supervised by <B>Cécile</B>. </LI><LI> BioBricks were constructed by <B>Amir</B> and supervised by <B>Cécile</B>. <B>Toky</B> and <B>Jonathan</B> participated on the design.
