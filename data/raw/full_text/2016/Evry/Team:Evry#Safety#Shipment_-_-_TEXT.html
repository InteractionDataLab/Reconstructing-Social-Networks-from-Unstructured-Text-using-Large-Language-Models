Shipment safety
When doing the Parts submission, we followed the instructions indicated on the Help Submission site: http://parts.igem.org/Help:Submission
We took care of labelling the samples as DNA (non-hazardous, non-regulated, non-infectious, for research purposes only), and we used prepared box for shippment as container. There was a short delay during the shipment procedure, but BioBricks arrived to the USA.
A part from DNA parts submission, we also had to do shipment when sequencing. For that, we used also a system of prepared labelling of samples and its primers, together with special boxes from the provider.
