Institute of Systems and Synthetic Biology (iSSB)
iSSB was created in 2008 on the foundations of the Epigenomics Project, a Genopole network with a nation-wide reach, dedicated to systems biology since 1999, and to synthetic biology (SynBio) since 2005. iSSB was the first laboratory dedicated to SynBio in Europe, together with IoSSB at Imperial College London. Today, it is still the sole French laboratory entirely dedicated to SynBio.
iSSB is the FRE3561 mixed research unit of Genopole, University of Évry-Val-d'Essonne, University Paris-Saclay and CNRS.
It includes four teams active in the fields of xeno-nucleic acids and synthetic genomics, and of synthetic biochemical circuits. Their acronyms are Xenome, MEGA, Synth-Bio and Bio-Retrosynth.
