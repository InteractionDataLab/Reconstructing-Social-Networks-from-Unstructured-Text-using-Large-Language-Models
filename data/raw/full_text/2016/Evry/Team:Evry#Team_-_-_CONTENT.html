I started on the lab bench during my degree in Human Biology, but now computers have become my hands for doing science. In my near future, I plan to become a theoretical biologist working on dynamics of populations. Hobbies? Music as the key piece of the puzzle.</P><P>I barely knew about iGEM before coming to Évry, but motivation of ex-participants was contagious. Constructing an own project on Synthetic biology in an interdisciplinary context sounds too appealing for refusing the opportunity. 
In the team, I have taken care of the modeling part and helped on the wet-lab, but my main role has been coordinating tasks and solving flux bottlenecks in team communication. </P><A target="_blank" class="team_linkedin paraleft" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-bargu%C3%A9s-ribera-a15026bb/en"> LinkedIn</A></DIV></DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="grid-2"><DIV class="one-third"><SPAN class="team_name">Jean Debédat</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="two-thirds"><SPAN class="team_age"> 24 years old</SPAN><SPAN class="team_formation"> M2 mSSB</SPAN><P>Born and raised in Bordeaux, I moved to Paris when I joined the mSSB, as I’ve always been interested in new technologies and new approaches regarding Sciences. In parallel, I was finishing my industrial pharmacy curriculum.</P><P>I decided to join iGEM very early last year, as it seemed really fun and a great opportunity to come together as students to carry out till the end an interdisciplinary project. As part of the team, I was mainly in charge of taking care of the Wiki and most of the infographics.</P><P>After the Jamboree, I’ll head right back to the lab in Paris, as I am now doing a PhD on the implications of the human gut microbiota in cardiometabolic diseases!</P><A target="_blank" class="team_linkedin paraleft" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-debédat-32623887"> LinkedIn</A></DIV></DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="grid-2"><DIV class="one-third"><SPAN class="team_name">Delphine Dessaux</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="two-thirds"><SPAN class="team_age"> 25 years old</SPAN><SPAN class="team_formation">M2 mSSB</SPAN><P>During iGEM, I was carrying out a master in Synthetic and Systems Biology in Evry, but I had a background mainly in biochemistry, more precisely in the proteins study. I learnt about iGEM during my Bachelor degree and I have always wanted to participate since then, but I couldn’t make it before this year. </P><P>My motivations? I wanted to discover lots of new interesting things in biology (wet lab as well as computer science) and share a great adventure with students from various fields. My hobbies? I enjoy reading novels and watching movies. A fun fact about me? I have no sense of direction, to the point that I lost my way in the lab several times during the first month of experiments. </P><P>My ideal synthetic biology project would have an environmental angle with, for example, bioremediation or pollutant detection involved. After the Jamboree, I will start a  PhD about DNA transport through nanopores.

I surely loved the concept of iGEM, of making some good and efficient fun from interesting ideas, and eventually spreading the whole story all around. And as the French philosopher Auguste Comte (almost) said, you can’t entirely know the science when you don’t know the story. So there, was the why.</P><P>The how, now. After a technical degree in industrial biology, a BSc in population biology and a MSc in microbiology, I signed to join the thrilling army of mSSBers, discovering, let’s say, the motivating, cosmopolitan, environment of Evry and the associated bunch of brilliant new friends. 
As for my role in the team, I was mainly present at the beginning of the project to coordinate the mess, to launch the administrative part, and to trigger brainstorming sessions at the pub. Then most of my tasks consisted in investigating on how Maria felt on late Friday nights. I also, c’est vrai, enjoyed the organization of The European Experience, and I took part in our search for sponsors.</P><P>On a more personal point of view, talking about passions: I have been working in science mediation for more than three years now. Because, you know, you can’t entirely know the science when blablabla… And now I will be back to Brest and to my first love (the ocean), to try to get myself a PhD by applying metabolic engineering to a marine extremophilic microbe.</P><A target="_blank" class="team_linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-hartunians-24284a99"> LinkedIn</A></DIV></DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="grid-2"><DIV class="one-third"><SPAN class="team_name">Taman Mhoumadi</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="two-thirds"><SPAN class="team_age"> 21 years old</SPAN><SPAN class="team_formation">M1 Health Law</SPAN><P>Hi, I am Taman !
