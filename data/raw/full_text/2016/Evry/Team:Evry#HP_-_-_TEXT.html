Banning Plastics
To degrade or not

For Human Practices, we started with investigation on issues related to plastic and bioplastic consumption by two approaches: a public survey and a report on plastic legislation. This investigation made emerge questions and necessities, which led us to perform a practical part to cover them, consisting on a MOOC. We also did a degradation experiment given some controversies. They also made us rethink about our project and give further insights, on the scaling perspective, taking them into account.
Initial investigation
By getting involved on the PLA idea, we got to know more about bioplastics and we felt more involved on the plastic waste problem. We aimed to discover how much other people knew about the topic and we conducted a survey.
Besides, we noted that globally, public policies tend to gradually ban plastic consumptions. We wondered bioplastic industry could be affected by restrictive legislations directed at petroleum-based plastics.
On the need of public awareness
After conducting a survey on our project, it appeared that people would prefer resorting to bioplastics in their daily life rather than petroleum-based equivalents. Yet the consumption of bioplastics remains lower. Therefore, we decided to focus on solutions to tackle this paradox.
We first noted that people don’t know much about PLA, and even less about synthetic biology. Thus, the first step required is to carry out a pedagogic communicative approach to arise interest on synthetic biology, and then on PLA. That is why we decided to focus on MOOCs as an effective tool to spread knowledge on this topic.
Controversy around biodegradation
While reading about PLA, we noticed there was diversity of opinions on its biodegradability. We decided to take an skeptical point of view and we performed a little experiment to empirically observe what happens in daily conditions.
Project insights
We carried out our PLA system development and its experiments before and during the human practices procedure, which made it difficult to apply on the wet-lab investigated issues. However, we stopped to think about how could we help on bioplastic society impact.
High prices of PLA products compared with petroleum-based equivalents hinders the consumption of this bioplastic. As those prices are related with low yields of PLA production, we decided to work on efficient ways of production through conceiving a DIY efficient bioreactor.
