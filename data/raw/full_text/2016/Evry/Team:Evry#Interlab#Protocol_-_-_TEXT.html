Protocol
Interlab protocol
The majority of the protocols for the Interlab study were provided by the iGEM HQ.
(see https://2016.igem.org/Tracks/Measurement/Interlab_study/Plate_Reader_Overview ).
Preparation of phosphate buffered saline 1X solution
8g NaCl for final concentration [137 mM]
0.2 KCl [2.7 mM]
1.44g Na2HPO4 [1 mM]
0.24g KH2PO4 [1.8 mM]
Add 800µL dH20 and mix. Then, adjust pH= 7.4 (7.2 if necessary) with HCl.
When the pH is good, qs 1 L. Sterilize by autoclaving.
Preparation of 1x TB “Step1”
Deionized H2O, to 900 mL
Tryptone, 12 g
Yeast extract, 24 g
Glycerol, 4 mL
Shake until the solutes have dissolved and then sterilize by autoclaving for 20 min at 15 psi (1.05 kg/cm2) on liquid cycle.
Preparation of 1x TB “Ready to use”
Add 100 mL of a sterile potassium phosphate solution in one liter of  1x TB “Step1”.
Preparation of potassium phosphate solution
It is a solution of 0.17 M KH2PO4, 0.72 M K2HPO4.
Dissolving 2.31 g of KH2PO4 and 12.54 g of K2HPO4 in 90 mL of H2O.
After the salts have dissolved, adjust the volume of the solution to 100 mL with H2O and sterilize by autoclaving for 20 min at 15 psi [1.05 kg/cm2] on liquid cycle.
Preparation of TB medium with betaine + sorbitol
 
for 12 mL
TB + RhoPhosphate
