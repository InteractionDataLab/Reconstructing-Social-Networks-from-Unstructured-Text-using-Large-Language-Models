Advisors
Asst. Prof Tan Meng How
Prof is a smart guy and he likes smart guys. He holds a spectrum of degrees from Economics (Berkeley) to Aeronautics (Caltech) to Biology (Stanford), making him literally a walking encyclopaedia. Also he usually replies messages so early in the morning that we ponder if he lives in California Time Zone.
Dr. yuan ming
Yuan Ming speaks very softly but his words carries weight! He's a very patient mentor and is very helpful to provide help when needed.
