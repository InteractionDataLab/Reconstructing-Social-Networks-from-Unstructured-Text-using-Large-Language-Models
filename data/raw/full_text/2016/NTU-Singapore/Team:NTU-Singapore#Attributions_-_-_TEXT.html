Thanks for the help and guidance!
We are very gratefull that we have these super helpful labmates that are willing to spend time teaching us! They are the key to our success! :)
Advisors
Asst. Prof Tan Meng How
Assembled the team and met with all the team members every week to provide guidance and set research directions. Designed gRNAs for project Evaluation and primers for genomic PCR.
Dr. Teh Min Yan
Mentored Fanxiang and Huanwen for Project Evolution. Taught us mammalian tissue culture
Dr. Yuan Ming
In-charge of Project Evaluation
Liu Kaiwen Ivy
Mentored us on Project Evaluation, taught us experiments involved in T7E assay.
Adventurers
Ooi Kean Hean
Student leader of the team. Designed the wiki, Cas9 models and exhibition items. In charge on Project Truncation, analysed crystal structure of Sp-dCas9 for determination of truncations, Gibson cloning of truncation regions, maintanence of HEK293FT cells and preparation for transfection, did flow cytometry and analysis of the results for Project Truncation.
Yong Jing Yen
Responsible for submission of parts and experiments involved in collaboration. Designed Cas9 models, poster and exhibition items. Cloned constructs for Project Evaluation and carried out T7E assay, transfection of HEK293 cells, FACS preparation and genomic PCR
Liu Zhehui
Designed the brochure for our exhibition. Designed the wiki. Photographer of our team. Helped out in Project Truncation, i.e. Gibson cloning of truncation regions, preparation of HEK293FT cells for transfection, flow cytometry, and derived truncation regions in the PI domain.
