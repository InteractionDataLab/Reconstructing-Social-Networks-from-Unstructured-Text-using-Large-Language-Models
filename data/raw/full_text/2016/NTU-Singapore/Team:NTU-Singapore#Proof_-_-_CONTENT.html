Another plasmids is used for gRNA expression and OFP marker for transfected cells. The cells are then passed through the flow cytometry to measure the Mean Fluorescent Intensity(MFI) of transfected cells.

On Recognition(REC) lobe, the REC2 domain has been shown to be deletable, despite with a reduced expression. Regions that we started on are as shown:</P><DIV style="margin: auto; width: 800px;"><P style="font-size:18px; text-align: center;">Schematic depicting the truncations of individual whole domains of SpCas9 that were evaluated.

We were very excited when we found out that the HNH domain can be deleted. The HNH and RuvC domains are known for their function as a helicase. Studies for specificity enhancement have shown that excess energy is provided for the separation of the non-targeted strand. We could only hypothesize that with HNH domain deleted, strand separation can still be aided by the RuvC domains.

</P></DIV><DIV class="page-header"><H2>Truncations of RuvCIII subdomains</H2></DIV><DIV class="well"><P>Next, we asked whether we might be able to delete smaller pieces of RuvCIII and still be able to activate gene expression using dSpCas9-VPR. It has been showed that the Cas9-RNA-DNA ternary complex exists in two different states, before and after the non-targeted strand(NTS) cleavage.</P><DIV style="margin: auto; width: 900px;"><P style="font-size:18px; text-align: center;">Conformations of RuvCIII in state A, before NTS cleavage and state B, after NTS cleavage</P></DIV><P>As shown above, when Cas9 transits from state A to state B, the loop connected to the HNH domain switches from an unstructures loop to an alpha helix(red) and is pulled towards the blue-white helix(in RuvCIII-2). This forces the white region within the blue helix to bend in order to accommodate the red helix. Also, the loop regions hightlighted in purple were not resolved in state B meaning that they may be flexible and not essential for binding interactions. As we know that the HNH can be deleted, this region involved in the movement of HNH might not be essential as well.</P><P>On the other hand, the cyan-highlighted(RuvCIII-1) helixes also has minimal interaction with non-targeted strand of DNA. Hence, we chose these two regions within RuvCIII as candidates for truncation.

As specificity studies have shown that mismatches at the PAM-distal sites, 3' end of target sequence, can be tolerated(refer below), we hypothesized that protein-DNA interaction is weaker at PAM-distal regions and hence, may be redundant for binding. </P><DIV style="margin: auto; width: 576px;"><P style="font-size:18px; text-align: center;">Tolerance of PAM-distal mismatches.

As a result, we realized it may not be easily achievable by deleting the whole PI region. Yet we believed PI domain has potential to be truncated because that is where the main difference is found between SpCas9 (370aa) and the much more compact SaCas9 (144aa). Thus, we have made a structural comparison of the PI domain between SpCas9 and SaCas9.  SpCas9 was found to have extra 5 alpha helices from 1225E – 1318G.

We then labeled it as PI2-all for potential target to be truncated. Hence, we have identified two target regions PI1 and PI2 for the truncation test.</P><P>We also made smaller truncations within PI1-all(PI1-1 to PI1-3) and PI2-all(PI-4) as we worry that large truncation may affect the structural integrity of the protein, as in the case of the RuvCIII truncation. </P><DIV style="margin: auto; width: 700px;"><P style="font-size:18px; text-align: center;">Truncations made within PI domain</P></DIV><DIV style="margin: auto; width: 706px;"><P style="font-size:18px; text-align: center;">Mean Fluorescence Intensity of each truncated PI structure</P></DIV><P> From the plot above, we know that unfortunately all the truncated dCas9 structures at PI domain do not exhibit similarly high activity as what we have obtained from Rec 1 and HNH truncations. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="page-header"><H2>Conclusion </H2></DIV><DIV class="well"><P>We then made a comparison among all the truncation combinations to see how the truncations compare among each other.</P><DIV align="center"><TABLE id="mutatoins" style="border: 0px"><TBODY><TR><TH>Size deleted</TH><TH>Mutant</TH><TH>Size </TH></TR><TR><TD style="text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing:3px;">Single Truncation</TD></TR><TR><TD>145</TD><TD>∆ REC1-1</TD><TD>1223</TD></TR><TR><TD>48</TD><TD>∆ REC1-3</TD><TD>1320</TD></TR><TR><TD>128</TD><TD>∆ REC2</TD><TD>1240</TD></TR><TR><TD>134</TD><TD>∆ HNH</TD><TD>1234</TD></TR><TR><TD>72</TD><TD>∆ RuvCIII-2</TD><TD>1296</TD></TR><TR><TD style="text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing:3px; padding-top: 10px">Double Truncations</TD></TR><TR><TD>182</TD><TD>∆ REC1-3 ∆ HNH</TD><TD>1186</TD></TR><TR><TD>262</TD><TD>∆ REC2 ∆ HNH</TD><TD>1106</TD></TR><TR><TD>206</TD><TD>∆ RuvCIII-2 ∆ HNH</TD><TD>1162</TD></TR><TR><TD style="text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing:3px; padding-top: 10px">Triple Truncations</TD></TR><TR><TD>334</TD><TD>∆ REC2 ∆ RUVCIII-2 ∆ HNH</TD><TD>1034</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><DIV style="margin: auto; width: 1000px;"><P style="font-size:18px; text-align: center;">MFI for truncations mutants that worked.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="exhibition" class="page-header"><H2>Evaluation</H2></DIV><DIV class="well"><P>The overall flow of doing a T7E experiment is as such:</P><P>We cloned plasmids containing various guide RNA sequences into the Cas9/Cpf1 vector with a -P2A-OFP reporter.

3.SaCas9, LbCpf1 and AsCpf1 works well with 19-13nt spacer but not reliable with 17-18nt spacers.</P><P>Due to the scarcity of target sites with PAM binding site for both Cas9 and Cpf1, most target sites are within intronic regions of the gene.

This selection plasmid encodes the toxin CcdB gene under the inducible BAD promoter.

While on the other hand, cells that carry a non-functional EZ SpCas9 variant, will not cleave the CcdB-Ampicillin plasmid.

The colony PCR results showed approximately 50% of the colonies contained the EZ plasmid and the other 50% contained the SpCas9WT::M13F plasmid. As we perform iterative rounds of competition assays, the ratio of EZ plasmid to SpCas9WT::M13F plasmid gradually increased, and eventually, all the tested cells contained only the EZ plasmid and none of them contained the SpCas9WT::M13F plasmid. The theory is that if the EZ SpCas9 variants are more efficient than SpCas9WT::M13F, cells that carry the EZ SpCas9 variants will replicate faster and their plasmid concentrations will increase as the rounds of competition assays increase.</P><DIV style="margin: auto; width: 800px;"><P style="font-size:18px; text-align: center;">Screen for WT colonies after each round of competition assay.</P></DIV><P>Upon completing the competition assay, a few colonies were sequenced to determine their Cas9 mutations.
