This project would not have taken firm shape had it not been for our instructors,
Asst. Prof. Deepak K. Saini
Prof. Umesh Varshney
Dr. Srinath Thiruneelkantan
Dr. Narmada Khare

The lab attendants of the UG Biology labs, Sai, Reena, Amrita, and Vinod, took time out of their schedule to let us perform our experiments. Vignesh and Krishna from the lab of Prof. Deepak Saini helped us out with gel extraction and fluorimeter readings. Sai Padma Priya a second year UG, designed our T-shirt and poster.

Message from the team
We, the members of the IISc iGEM team are extremely grateful for the support we have received everyone who came to our aid. From "Let's participate in iGEM" to finally reaching the Giant Jamboree was long journey, and we received advice and help from different people in our path. Chaitra and Sachit attended our brainstorming sessions and actively aided our coming up with our idea, and also getting our grants. The undergraduate department payed for our registration, and allowed us unhindered access to all the UG biology labs and the reagents in them. Dr. Deepak Saini (MRDG, IISc) and Prof. Umesh Varshney (MCB, IISc) were kind enough to mentor us and lend our team their deep insight in molecular biology. Our lab instructors, Dr. Srinath and Dr. Narmada, helped us out in our lab work and troubleshooting. Finally, we would like to thank Career Support Group - a group of IISc alumni, who helped us raise money through crowd funding, to pay for the apartment we rented for our stay in Boston.
