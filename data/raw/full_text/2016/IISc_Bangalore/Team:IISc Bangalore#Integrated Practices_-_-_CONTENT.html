We wanted to understand the facilities available in these parks to see if there existed a need for improvement and gauge the feasibility of implementing our project in these parks. We found that the bioreactors in these parks had no sensors, centrifuges or any level of automation. These bioreactors were currently used only to grow cultures that were sold without further processing.</P><P>We input information learned from our visit into our project by developing biobricks and a protocol to perform functions usually done by machines, which were not available in these parks like centrifugation, automatic induction and cell density monitoring. This would enable more complicated protocols required for the biosynthesis of most useful products to be undertaken at these facilities.</P><P>Thus, we integrated information gleaned from the visit in the processes targeted by cellfifuge.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="content-middle wthree"><DIV class="container" id="refer"><DIV class="mid-content fadeInRight wow  animated" data-wow-delay=".5s"><H3>Biotech Park Visit</H3></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="refer col-md-6"><B>Visit to Biotechnology Park</B><P>As stated in the introduction, our project is an attempt to modify <I>E. coli</I> to lower capital and running costs for rDNA bioreactor systems, by automating protein over-expression induction and separation of cell from growth media.

The intent was to convince our government representatives of the need for enhancing the current government biotechnology facilities and a possible option of doing so.</P><P>The novelty of using Ag43 for clarification of cell cultures and using this to replace or supplement energy and capital expensive centrifuges and its application in conjunction with auto-induction using quorum sensing made our idea patent worthy in their opinion and hence, to continue our research, the GoK’s biotechnology department granted us ~$9,000 towards consumables for our project.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="footer"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="footer-grids"><DIV class="col-md-4 footer-grid animated wow fadeInDown animated animated" data-wow-duration="1200ms" data-wow-delay="500ms"><H3>Sponsors</H3></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4 footer-grid animated wow fadeInUp animated animated" data-wow-duration="1200ms" data-wow-delay="500ms"><H3>Social</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
