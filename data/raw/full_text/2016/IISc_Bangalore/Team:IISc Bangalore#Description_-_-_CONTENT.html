         As stated in the introduction, our project is an attempt to modify E coli to lower capital and running costs for rDNA bioreactor systems, by automating protein over-expression induction and separation of cell from growth media. 
To learn more about the existing biotech infrastructure in India, we decided to visit some biotech parks in India and explore the feasibility and applicability of our idea.

					With the advent of rDNA technology in the late 1970s, medicine, agriculture and several other areas underwent a quantum leap and from that point, progress only hastened, from one only one recombinant pharmaceutical  approved for human use (insulin) in 1982 to one hundred and fifty-one FDA approved protein based recombinant pharmaceuticals by 2009<A href="#refer" onclick="closeTab()">[1]</A>.
Despite being in high demand (due to the fact that most recombinant products produced on an industrial scale are therapies for chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes), recombinant products are expensive due to several factors like long and expensive development time, high failure rate (~80%) of the products developed, manufacturing costs requiring expensive technologies and processes (bioreactors, column chromatography, sterile conditions, etc) and the involvement of skilled labor on both the manufacturing and the healthcare provider’s side<A href="#refer" onclick="closeTab()">[2]</A>. Treatments with these pharmaceuticals can cost from around 10,000 to 100,000 € per year for a single patient[2]. As scientists and engineers, it seems obvious that our contribution can be most easily and effectively be made at the level of manufacturing costs; to try to bring down the cost of these life-saving products.

We realized that we would not be able to work on the whole idea this summer so, we focussed on two modules of our design: the Protein production module and the auto-aggregation module leaving the arresting of cell growth for future iGEM teams as a seed for their ideas.
