Missouri S&T iGEM Team
Missouri S&T iGEM began in 2007 with a handful of members, but has grown rapidly in recent years. We are a proud member of the Student Design and Experiential Learning Center , and participation in student-led design teams is a respected tradition on campus. Members from all majors are welcome with any level of experience. Our team is almost entirely student-directed with our advisors using a hands-off approach. Projects are designed, selected, and performed by undergraduates with advice from our wonderful mentors. An extensive lab training program ensures safety and productivity from all lab workers while allowing new members to learn the necessary skills and concepts for work in synthetic biology. Members also have opportunities to contribute to vital fundraising, public relations, and publication functions.
