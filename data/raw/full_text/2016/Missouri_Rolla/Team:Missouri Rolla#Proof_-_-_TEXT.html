iGEM teams are great at making things work! We value teams not only doing an incredible job with theoretical models and experiments, but also in taking the first steps to make their project real.
What should we do for our proof of concept?
You can assemble a device from BioBricks and show it works. You could build some equipment if you're competing for the hardware award. You can create a working model of your software for the software award. Please note that this not an exhaustive list of activities you can do to fulfill the gold medal criterion. As always, your aim is to impress the judges!
