These last iGEM-months have not only been marked by a lot of research and labwork, but also by a lot of fun and teamspirit. At this point we want to thank everybody who helped us to realize this project. May it be with help to get started, organisational hints or scientific background information.  In the following we want to give special thanks and credit to the people, without whom it would not have been possible to establish our project.
Laboratory and Expertise
Institute of Synthetic Biology
Prof. Dr. Matias Zurbriggen, one of our PIs, supported us with technical and theoretical input. Furthermore he offered us space in his laboratory to work on our project and has always been willing to help us with problems or questions. Prof. Dr. Matias Zurbriggen will also accompany us in Boston.
Tim Blomeier who showed us how to work with cell cultures and assisted us during our work in their laboratory.
Institute of Plant Biochemistry
Prof. Dr. Andreas Weber, who is also our PI, was the one who brought up iGem in the first place. He informed us about the competition in one of his lectures and encouraged us to participate. After we formed our team and project idea Prof. Dr. Weber provided us with space in his Lab and also financial aid.
Samantha Kurz who spent a lot of her time with us in the lab to help us with techniques and general know-how about the work in laboratories.
Institute of Microbiology
Prof. Dr. Michael Feldbrügge supported our team with a laboratory and also with one of his technical assistants, Ute Gengenbacher, to assist us during our work in the lab.
Ute Gengenbacher, our Instructor, accompanied us during our project and helped us with basics as much as with difficult techniques. She spent a lot time with us during our lab work and lend us a hand wherever she could, even though it was her freetime.  Ute Gengenbacher will come with us to Boston to finish the project.
Expertise
Nicolas Krink-Koutsoubelis, our iGEM Mentor, assisted us during several video conferences, meet ups and written conversations with a lots of details about iGEM and his personal experiences in the competition as well as professional knowledge about synthetic biology.
Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Wolfgang Schulz who gave us useful input regarding possible application in cancer cells and which cancer cell lines might be appropriate to use.
Barbara Di Ventura of the DKFZ helped us by discussing relevant questions about our project.
Beate Kaufmann of Team Freiburg 2010, who gave as insight on the topic of viral vectors, especially AAVs.
STED Microscope
For the documentation of our results we needed help with microscoping. Dr. Thomas Zobel from the Center for Advanced Imaging was so kind to support us with his expertise so we were able to take and edit our pictures. Furthermore he gave us lot of material for preparing the cell cultivation for the microscope.
Design
Tobias Lorenz designed our beautiful logo and iGEM banner and has been really patient with us and our ideas.
Niklas Banowski, a semi-professional photographer , who took the photos of our team-page .
Hardware
Prof. Dr. Oliver Ebenhoeh, Prof. Dr. Dieter Schumacher and Philipp Norf who helped us tremendously with designing our light boxes.
Organisational Matters
Brigitte Haumann provided us with assistance regarding the organization of our project including all kinds of aspects and has been very helpful right from the beginning of the project until the very end.
Dr. Christian Dumpitak helped us a lot with the survey and gave us a professional presentation training
Georg Pretzler who assisted us with organizational help of our presentations and experiments in the “Haus der Universitaet” during the celebration of the 70th birthday of Northrhine- Westfalia  in Duesseldorf.
Kenan Hadzihamzic, Dimitri Tzourmbakis and Branko Beljak teached us a lot about team building and self-presentation.
Financial Management
Karin Schmelzer and Daria Biercher who helped us with the organization of financial issues.
BfArM & PEI
Gudula Müller whose organisation made it possible for us to visit the BfArM.
Roland Frötschl and Bodo Haas who were so kind to meet us at the BfArM and besides showing us around they went through the whole process of the development of a medicament with us and gave us relevant contact information to the Paul- Ehrlich- Institute.
Dr. Brigitte Anliker and Priv.- Doz. Dr. Matthias Renner of the Paul- Ehrlich- Institute who gave us relevant information about gene therapeutics to discuss special aspects.
Personal Business Contact
Julia Goetsch, an employee of the company Promega, visited us at our university to demonstrate basic lab procedures and to provide us with scientific knowledge as well as with laboratory equipment.
Brian Caudill from IDT who explained the most important aspects of using the synthesis sponsored by IDT to us.
Last, but not least many thanks to our sponsors who made it possible for us to realize our project and attend the Giant Jamboree as a team.
