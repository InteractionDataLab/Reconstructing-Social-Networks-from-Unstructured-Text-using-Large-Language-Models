Imagine you turn the switch on and the cancer is gone…
Cancer is the second most common cause of death killing about 8.2 million people annually, which equals the total population of New York City.  The global increase of cancer cases and the lack of highly specific therapies for various types of cancer states a clear message:
New approaches have to be found, which allow a level of precision in cancer treatment that has been long-awaited.
Our approach aims at achieving high spatiotemporal control of apoptosis in tumor cells by applying an optogenetic double-killswitch. This system combines clean removal of cancer cells through apoptosis with the accuracy of light-controlled optogenetics. We utilize two optogenetic proteins, to create the desperately needed holy grail of cancer therapy.
This is the goal of OPTOPTOSIS.
Our Achievements
Bronze
Register And Attend
Our team was successfully registered and had the greatest summer ever
Attribution
We created our own Wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of our project
Deliverables
The judging form and safety form was completed with great care
We are very excited to present our poster and project talk at the Giant Jamboree
We attributed and acknowledged all of the work done for our project on our Wiki page
We documented and created Part pages for our Parts and submitted the DNA samples of our new Parts to the Registry
Part/Contribution
We are proud of our new standard Biobrick Part and submitted BBa_K1936000 to the iGEM Registry
Silver
Collaboration
We had great collaborations with other teams and are really happy about our common success
Validated Part / Validated Contribution
We characterized BBa_K1936001
This part was submitted to the iGEM registry and is experimentally validated
Human Practices
Of course, we shared our project and knowledge with the public and talked about the ethical aspects . We had a lot of fun at our different human practice activities.
Gold
Integrated Human Practices
Additionally to our Human Practice work we visited the BfArM (the german equivalent of the FDA) and telephoned with the Paul Ehrlich Institute , which is responsible for admission of genetherapeutics, to consult professional critics concerning future applications of our project
Proof of concept
We are really happy that we are able to show a functional proof of concept of our project with one of our newly created BioBricks
Demonstrate your work
We were able to show our functional proof of concept under real world conditions with experiments in human cancer cell culture

Results and engineered constructs of OPTOPTOSIS
Our red switch operates as desired
we were able to show that our apoptosis protein is expressed
our testing cells are still alive
Our blue switch operates as desired when constitutively expressed
we were able to show that our construct is expressed
we assume that our construct binds to the outer mitochondrial membrane but are still testing it
The double transfection of our two constructs worked as desired
we were able to detect gene expression of both constructs in transfected cells
we were able to determine the expression of the red- switch
we have seen indications of induced apoptosis but will further validate it
