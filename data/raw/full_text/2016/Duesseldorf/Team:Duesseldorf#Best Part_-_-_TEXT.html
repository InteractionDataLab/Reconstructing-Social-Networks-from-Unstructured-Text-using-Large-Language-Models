Mitochondrial Marriage - LOV is all you need
There is a huge variety of molecules which interact with the mitochondria as they are of high importance considering metabolic pathways. A controlled localization is invaluable when characterizing these molecules. But as eucaryotic cells are large there is a lot of room for interference. At this very point our blue- light switch is there to help you out!
Its ability to bind whatever you want to the mitochondria allows future researchers to have full control over the localization of their protein with the help of  just one simple construct. It is as simple as brilliant. But you are not only able to recurit any protein of interest to the outer mitochondrial membrane, it also gives you the opportunity to see it as it is marked with GFP.
