Parts
For the construction of our parts, we made use of the IDT synthesis offer. This way we were able to                             generate our required parts in a fast and efficient way. All of the parts were designed containing the coding                             sequence, RBS, promoter and terminators, if applicable. Therefore, all of the parts we used are composite .                             The different basic parts comprising the composite parts are documented seperately, although they do not exist induvidually.                             In the case of a constitutive expression, the promoter is included in the biobrick itself.                             For the inducible expression, however, we made use of a plasmid backbone containing a Lac-promoter                             and the LacI gene, which encodes for the Lac repressor. Consequently, these parts themselves do                             not contain a promoter. Additionally, using PCR rather than synthesis, we constructed a small collection of GFP expression devices with different promoter strengths, based on an existing biobrick. Thereby improving both the function and characterization of the original part

Part Collection
We provided a small collection of GFP expression devices with different promoter                         strengths, which we used to study the effect of different levels of constitutive expression. These parts are                         ready-to-go expression units for green fluorescence, which can be useful for future teams. By constructing these parts, we improved both the function and the characterization of the original part BBa_E0840 .
