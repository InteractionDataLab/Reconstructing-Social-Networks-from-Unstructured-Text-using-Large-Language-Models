changes the optical properties of bacteria in order to make them into biological lasers and lenses at length scales close to the wavelength of light itself. Modeling was required to explain and predict the possibilities within the physical limits. We modeled the various components of our system from scratch, using ray and wave optics as well as kinetic and dynamic models solved by analytical and numerical simulation techniques. Our models helped the lab-team by predicting the largest obstacles of turning <I>E. coli</I> into a lens or laser. <STRONG> We found that making lasing <I>E. coli</I> is physically impossible since either the cell size or the fluorophore concentration has to be increased by a factor 10. </STRONG>This result directed the project more towards biolens development.</P><P>A series of studies were performed to determine if there is any focusing effect from the polysilicate covered <I>E. coli</I> cells. Secondly, the optical properties of various shapes of the cell and various thicknesses of the polysilicate layer are characterized on how they influence the performance of the microlenses. Our models predict that microbial biolenses can focus light and scatter most of it forwards. Therefore, our biolenses are promising for microlens applications. <STRONG> Finally we concluded that the best shape is the round cells as it is orientation independent and advised the lab team to pursue this design.</STRONG> Therefore the labteam investigated the possibilities to making <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:TU_Delft/Project#collapseEen" target="_blank"> spherical <I>E. coli</I> cells</A>. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><H2 class="title-style-1">Biolasers</H2><DIV class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><P>We investigated the physics behind the possibilities of using <I>E. coli</I> as a laser cavity.

Using our models, we predicted the physical limitations of using <I>E. coli</I> as a laser cavity. 
In order to understand what lasing cells are and how to achieve them, we need to get some background knowledge on conventional lasers first. We will give a short introduction to lasers below, you can find a more detailed description of lasers <B><A href="/Team:TU_Delft/Model/Theory#lasers" target="_blank">here</A></B>. </P><P> ‘Laser’ stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. In conventional lasers light resonates in an

For most conventional lasers this is accomplished by placing two mirrors directly opposite each other. The gain medium is located in between the mirrors. </SPAN></A>, which is a space between two mirrors filled with a gain medium (figure 1A). The molecules in the gain medium get excited (in a higher-energy state) by an excitation source, for example an electric pulse or another laser. When a light particle, a photon, collides with a molecule that is in the excited state, this molecule will release a copy of the incident photon. This process is called stimulated emission and results in light getting amplified every time it passes through the gain medium.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 1:</B> (A) Conventional laser. In a conventional laser an optical cavity is the space between two mirrors opposite to each other. The optical cavity is filled with a gain medium  composed of molecules that can get excited by an external excitation source, such as light or electric current. (B) For biolasers we use a reflective surface instead of mirrors. As an excitation source we use a laser that can excite the gain medium. The gain medium we use is composed of fluorescent proteins. 
</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>To make biological lasers we constructed an optical cavity inside a bacterium. As explained above, to get a laser, an optical cavity spaced between mirrors and a gain medium is required. To create the optical cavity between mirrors in the biolaser, we engineered the bacteria to form a reflective layer. We investigated two options for making a reflective layer inside <I>E. coli</I>.</P><P> First we investigated the possibility of making an optical cavity from the entire cell. Therefore we encapsulated the cell in a reflective surface (figure 1B). To make a reflective surface, we engineered bacteria to grow a polysilicate or tin dioxide layer on its outer membrane using the enzyme silicatein <A href="#references">(André <I>et al.,</I> 2011, Müller <I>et al.,</I>, 2008)</A>. When silicic acid or tin dioxide monomers are present in the extracellular surroundings, silicatein can polymerize these monomers. Silicatein can then produce a layer on the outside membrane when it is expressed and transported to the outside membrane. Silicatein can produce such a layer form silicic acid as a substrate but also from tin dioxide. Using modeling we will investigate what the effects are of using these two substrates. The labteam was only able to use silicic acid as a substrate but since tin dioxide has a hihger refractive index than polysilicate, it is an interesting alternative for further research. </P><P>As an alternative, we investigated the possibility to make an optical cavity from part of the cell. To this end we would have to engineer <I>E. coli</I> to produce PHB granules, in which the light can resonate; the boundary of the granule then acts as a mirror when total internal reflection takes place.</P><P>The materials polysilica, tin dioxide and PHB can act as a reflective layer since they have a higher refractive index compared to the cytoplasm. To get amplification of photons (i.e. produce a gain medium inside the cell) we express the fluorescent proteins GFP, mVenus, and mCerulean, which we excite with an external (pumping) laser.</P><P>Below you can find several models we made to investigate the limitations and opportunities of turning <I>E. coli</I> into a laser. The first aim of our modeling work was to predict and explain how light can resonate in our biological laser cavities. The first question we addressed was what the minimal size of a cell is for light to resonate inside as in a biolaser <B><A href="#Qs">(Q1)</A></B>.

Here we determine what the minimal size of the bacteria should be to fit light inside the encapsulated <I>E. coli</I>, using ray optics.  We found that a polysilicate covered cell should have a minimal diameter of 1-1.3 µm depending on the fluorescent proteins used.

In a similar method as for the encapsulated <I>E. coli</I>, the minimal size of the PHB granules was determined by ray optics. We found that the minimal diameter of the PHB granules is about 1.7 µm, which is larger than the small axis of <I>E. coli</I>.

Since concentrations an order of magnitude higher is impossible to reach within the cell, lasing is physically not possible in our cells. Due to the small size of our cells, the mirror losses are much higher than in a large laser cavity since the photons will bounce more often to the mirrors while traveling the same distance.

This mode has the eigenfrequency of \(\omega = 6.028\times10^{14} + i\times2.3 \times 10^{11} \) Hz and results in a Q factor of \(Q=1.3109\times10^3\). </P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-12"><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 4: </B>Eigenmode of the tin dioxide covered cell, omega is: \(\omega = 6.028\times10^{14} + i\times2.3 \times 10^{11} \).</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV></DIV><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:TU_Delft/Model/Q4" class="btn btn-info" role="button" style="text-decoration:none; color:#f3f4f4; float:left;">Complete model</A><A href="#Qs" class="btn btn-info" role="button" onclick="$('html,body').animate({scrollTop: $('#Qs').offset().top}, 'slow');" style="text-decoration:none; color:#f3f4f4; float:right;">Back to Top</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><H2 class="title-style-1">Biolenses</H2><DIV class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-12"><P>We modeled <I>E. coli</I> cells covered with a polysilicate layer to investigate whether they can act as a biological micro lenses. The interaction of the cells covered in polysilicate can be calculated from <I>Gustav Mie’s</I> solution of the Maxwell equations, usually referred to as the<A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:TU_Delft/Model/Theory#mie" target="_blank"><B>Mie Theory</B></A>. In this project we used COMSOL Multiphysics and CST suit to model the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:TU_Delft/Model/Theory#light" target="_blank"><B>electromagnetic field</B></A> interacting  with our structures. In both COMSOL and CST we are using the RF modules which solve the Maxwell equations and can be used for Mie scattering problems. </P><P>It is important here to note that the reason that Maxwell’s equations were used and not the simpler ray optics is that the size of the cells is around \(1\mu m\) which is in the same scale as the wavelength used (in the visible spectrum, usually 500 nm), which means that the wave nature of light has to be taken into account and not the particle nature used in the ray optics. Figure 1 demonstrates an example of a beam of light passing through our structure. This simulation was made using the CST Studio Suit, it is in the time domain, meaning that we have an electromagnetic field and we see how it propagates in time and how interacts with the cell All of this happens in the time span of femto seconds. This kind of simulations, even though they are impressive, are very computationally expensive and we used a server to run them. For this reason, all the other simulations shown in the studies below were performed in the frequency domain, meaning that we assumed steady state and modeled for one instance instead of a series of steps.

In this question there were two main parts. Firstly, we investigated if the polysilicate covered cells are actually able to focus light. Secondly, we modeled how the rod shaped structure behaves compared to the more symmetrical spherical cells.</P><P>In order to determine how light scatters on the bacterial microlenses we created models that simulate the interaction of electromagnetic waves (light) with our structure. We concluded that focusing is possible both for the rod shaped and for the spherical cell. Figure 1 demonstrates a time domain investigation of the light scattering. It is important to note that there is not a traditional well defined focal point, as we see in the ray optics, but rather a broader focal area where the intensity of the field is higher. Even though this is not a focal point we can still clearly see focusing of the light which is useful for our application.</P><P>After we saw that indeed we can have focusing we wanted to see how the two different shapes behave. First was the simpler spherical model and second the better representation of a cell, the rod shaped model. The conclusion was that, although all types were able to focus light, the rod shaped models are orientation dependent and thus they are not the best option compared to the spherical ones that are orientation independent. This led the lab team to investigate ways to <A href=" https://2016.igem.org/Team:TU_Delft/Project " target="_blank"><B>change the shape of the cells to spherical cells </B></A> to improve their behavior.</P><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:TU_Delft/Model/Q5" class="btn btn-info" role="button" style="text-decoration:none; color:#f3f4f4; float:left;">Complete model</A><A href="#Qs" class="btn btn-info" role="button" onclick="$('html,body').animate({scrollTop: $('#Qs').offset().top}, 'slow');" style="text-decoration:none; color:#f3f4f4; float:right;">Back to Top</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="panel panel-default"><A class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2" href="#Q6" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="Q6"><DIV class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingQ6"><H4 class="panel-title">Q6.
