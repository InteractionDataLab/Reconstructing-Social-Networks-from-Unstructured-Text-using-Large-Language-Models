Statistics
We are lucky that over the years a lot of people became interested in our iGEM projects. We already started out with a lot of likes on Facebook, but as can be seen in figure 1 we were able to boost this number of likes up even higher! With almost 900 likes on facebook we were able to reach a lot of people (figure 2) and we were able to promote our project and boost awareness to synthetic biology.
Figure 1: The number of likes of our facebook page
Figure 2: The number of people reached through our facebook page
Our likers are mostly people in their twenties, probably students. (figure 3)
