We all worked really hard on our project and credits go to our entire team.
Carmen
Policy and Practice Manager
As Policy and Practice manger it was my task to “connect” our product to the real world. I was responsible for finding applications for our project. One of those applications, the micro lens arrays as encapsulation layer for solar panels, appeared to be commercially very interesting and I have written a business plan about this application therefore. Furthermore, I have been in contact with multiple researchers, managers and scientists to discuss and improve our project.  Together with Lara, I have worked on a report about iGEM and I think we found some interesting ways to improve iGEM even further. Furthermore, I really enjoyed working with Iris on the Safety tool we have developed in collaboration with the RIVM. Eventually, I have presented the tool during the RIVM and Rathneau event. Next to this event we contributed to multiple other events and it was my responsibility to organize this. Additionally, I have supported Liza with the modeling and I also made the final presentation together with Charlotte.
Célina
Public Relations Manager
As PR manager my function was managing contact with the community. Therefore I placed weekly updates on the Facebook and started a LinkedIn page for the team. I went a few times to our communication advisors of the TU Delft, Wendy Dallinga and Lenny Bakker. They helped me with creating a press release. I also managed to get articles on different websites, magazines and newspapers. For policy and practice I made a little start in looking into how to optimize teamwork within a team. For the wet lab, I helped a few times, such as doing colony PCR, ligation and transformation.
Charlotte
Hardware, Graphics and Safety Manager
My first task was being the hardware manager. For this task I have approached a great amount of optics and photonics companies and requested sponsoring, discounts or borrowing equipment that was required for building the optical setup. Once all equipment was collected I was responsible for building the optical setup and testing our cells in it. Furthermore, I was responsible for conducting all wide field and confocal microscopy experiments, together with Liza. My second responsibility was being graphics manager. Here my main task was designing and making the posters and presentations. Furthermore, this task included designing and making the logo, figures and all outreach materials for the team, as well as making sure that all data from our experiments is represented in a clear and professional way. Lastly, I was the safety manager of the team. This means I wrote the research proposal for our project including all safety considerations and handed in all the iGEM safety forms. It was my responsibility that all ML-1 safety measures were met. Besides my managing functions, I also made and did the final presentation, helped out in the lab, did a little modeling and arranged some conversations with experts for policy & practice.
Giannis
Team Leader
As a team leader I was responsible for the organizational aspects of the project. This means I had to find places for the team to stay and dine in Boston, arrange the registration of the team members and mentors for the Jamboree, communicate with headquarters with problems we had, but also more day-to-day chores such as chairing the weekly meetings and reminding the team about deadlines, and creating weekly updates for the advisors. Additionally, I was involved in the modeling part of the project with Liza. As a modeler I firstly created scattering models for thin films to define the reflectivity depending from the refractive indices, thickness, wavelength and angle, and later, models of electromagnetic waves interaction with the biological microlenses to determine the scattering pattern and any focusing and Eigenmodes model for the laser part of the project.
Iris
Safety Tool Manager
I contributed to various subtopics of the iGEM project. I have mainly been involved in the safety and risk management related topics, a part of policy and practice. I am largely responsible for the implementation of general safe-by-design strategies in the shape of a safety tool. Carmen, our policy and practice manager, and I designed and created the software for this tool. In addition, I have contributed to the lab work, especially in the first phases of the project.
Lara
Finance Manager
As the finance manager I was first of all responsible for the external collaborations and communications. Getting in touch with companies and other stakeholders to receive funds and enthuse them about our project. Besides taking care of all funding, I also was the treasurer of our team, tracking our budget closely. Furthermore, as part of the core labteam, I have spent a lot of time in the wetlab making our constructs and characterizing them. At last, I also made a significant contribution to the policy and practice by co-writing our strategy report and the organization of several outreach events.
Liza
Modeling Manager
As a modeling manager I was responsible for making models underlying the work of the lab team. In order to create these models a good understanding of the physics was required and therefore I also have studied a lot of physics concepts. Therefore I also talked with experts. With my knowledge of the underlying physics I also assisted and advised the lab team. Furthermore I have helped Charlotte with building the optical setup. I also was involved in characterizing the lasing in both the optical setup we build as the microscope of the university. Furthermore I made Transmission microscopy images of the vesicles of the Wageningen team and of our silica  covered cells.
Lycka
Science Manager
As science manager I closely collaborated with the lab manager, María. Our first task was to design all of the biobricks, which we did after a period of literature research. Subsequently, we were the ones spending most time in the lab, working on the cloning and helping out less experienced team members. It was my responsibility to troubleshoot together with María and the advisors, when experiments did not work out as expected. Furthermore, I designed experiments to characterize our biobricks according to literature. When I was not working in the lab, I helped Liza modelling the laser threshold.
María
Lab Manager
My role as a lab manager was to make sure that everything in the lab was ready (equipment, protocols...). Also, I have worked together with Lycka in the science and experimental design of the wet lab part of the project. At the beginning it would be us two in charge of figuring out everything we needed and how it worked and then passed it on to the rest of the core lab team members to be able to work as fast and efficiently as possible.
Tessa
Wiki Manager
As Wiki Manager my first and foremost responsibility was the design and content of the wiki. I designed our wiki according to our house style, created by Charlotte, and I uploaded most of the files. I also reminded others to write pieces for on the wiki, so I could create a page around it. What I really enjoined about being the Wiki Manger is the fact that it was my responsibility to make all the pages both clear and look nice. Therefore, I discussed with every Manger extensively how their page should look like and in that way I was always partly involved in all the parts of our project. Besides this I also spend a lot of time in the lab helping with the cloning of our biobricks and I worked on the InterLab study. I also went to modeling meetings and I helped Carmen with the policy & practice when I had the time.

Sigma and Aldrich were founded separately in 1935 and 1951, respectively, to supply biochemicals and chemicals to research scientists in the U.S. Both companies started with the production and distribution of a single proprietary chemical: Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by Sigma and 1-methyl-3- nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) by Aldrich. For many years, the two companies grew independently, Sigma serving primarily biochemists and Aldrich serving organic chemists. When changing trends in chemical research confirmed the synergy to be realized from their complementary product offerings, Aldrich Chemical Co. merged with Sigma International, Ltd., in 1975 forming Sigma-Aldrich Corporation. With this marriage of broad capabilities and resources, annual double-digit sales growth became the standard in the 1980s and 1990s, with significant expansion in facilities, acquisitions and ventures into new market sectors.
