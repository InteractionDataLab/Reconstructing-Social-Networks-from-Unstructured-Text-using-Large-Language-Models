Model
The mathematical model presented is based on the a relationship between temperatures of the State of Chihuahua throughout the year (2015 data) to determine the rate of growth of Myxobacteria in local soils. From this data, the population of bacteria in the soil it is determined and knowing the protein production of each cell we can determine an estimated antifungal expression. This way, we can determine if there exists any harmful effect in the environment due to the effects of Myxobacteriaâ€™s protein expression.
