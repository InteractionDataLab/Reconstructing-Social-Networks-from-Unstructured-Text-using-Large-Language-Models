Science is not only about laboratory work or projects, but also context in social, geographical and global aspects. Synthetic Biology as a multidisciplinary science gathers different persons, scientists, and individuals. Therefore, it is essential to                     evaluate the circumstances at which every scientific project is developed, having in mind the responsibility that it carries.
The implications of Synthetic Biology (hereinafter also referred to as SB)                     have repercussions from the Ethical, Economical and Legal perspectives. Our team analyzed said perspectives with a focus on the Latin-American dimension, for the diffusion of SB in the light of a responsible progress.
On the 18th of October we held an event at the facilities of our college called “Café Con Ciencia: Myxobacteria as biological control method for phytopathogenic fungi in crops”. This day we were finally able to expose to our mates, families, professors, alumni and public in general what we have been doing for the last ten months. It was a very special moment because as a team we realized that everything was coming to an end plus it was useful as we received some feedback from our mentors and PhDs to improve our presentation in Boston.
The ethical approach focuses on the openness issue: the paradigms of exclusivity and attributions, its relation to the intellectual property (IP) system; the democratic and modular nature of SB; advancement and                         its implications concerning security.

From an Economic point of view, we discuss some of the effects that SB could cause, mainly in the context of developing economies and agriculture. SB could tend to increase the risk of displacement of individuals                         employed in the agricultural sector. Some of the Latin American economies could be at risk of being affected by the advancements of SB.

The arrival of Synthetic Biology
The Legal analysis focuses on the persistent need for an effective regulation of SB at international, regional and local level. The main legal aspects concerning SB regard the application of the IPR system, the                         effects of the possible application of contractual provisions as an alternative to IPR, and the issues concerning safety and security.

Involuntary Effects of Synthetic Biology
The diffusion of SB is an important element of Human Practices. We applied it firstly by contacting local farmers and stakeholders from the agricultural sector in order to learn about their positions, targeting their main necessities, as well as knowing how would our project be perceived.
Synthetic Biology: A look through the Lens of Latin America
The second part of diffusion in our project is a document where you can see on detail the analysis made by our team in the Ethical, Economical and Legal aspects of Synthetic Biology in Latin America. We analyzed the above mentioned problems, in order                         to propose possible solutions that aim to be incorporated at regulamentary level. Our guidelines can be employed by companies, associations and governments to develop provisions regulating quality, management of bioparts, safety,                         as well as reconcile the main economic, ethical and legal issues surrounding SB.

Openness
Individuals can contribute to a common source of knowledge that is accessible for everyone and can benefit the community

Inclusivity
Discourse ethics defends a morality of equal respect and solidaristic responsibility

Exclusiveness and the IP conflict
The patent system is based in the principle that incentives are needed to have more creations and progress. SB involves biotechnology and software, opposite sciences concerning IP (the first one with patents, the second one with openness); therefore suggesting difficulties on the definition of Intellectual property for SB.

Progress
Progress is reached by advancements, but advancements not necessarily result in progress. Exclusiveness creates advancements, but do they create progress? Is the actual system (exclusiveness) democratic?

Democracy
Dialogue and participation are essential for SB, both to prevent harm and to ensure science is matter of every person (since it affects everyone equally).

The arrival of Synthetic Biology.
New technologies impact population, economic sectors, and industries. SB could have a great impact, both positive or negative, depending crucially on how the particular government of a country reacts to SB’s arrival.

Biotechnology Industry
The advancements in scientific techniques, such as genetic manipulation has lead to advancements that have affected the existing economies.

Security risks and Bioterrorism
SB might provide “non-experts” with easier tools that could be used for negative purposes. Lowering the complexity of a science means also making it accessible to perpetrators with motivations distant from science. This is why awareness must be ensured, the strategy of diffusion must be enhanced.

Law for Synthetic Biology
The limits of IP could mine SB’s development. So, what kind of property regime would best suit SB: patents, copyrights or trademarks? It is also important to have in mind that an excess of property claims in science would make impossible for other people to use it.

Involuntary Effects of Synthetic Biology
Not every negative consequence from SB is intentional. Biocontainment is an effective alternative to prevent undesired repercussions of SB on the environment.
