Our team worked diligently to fulfill the requirements for bronze and silver medals.
Bronze
1.- Register and attend: iGEM Tec-Chihuahua is signed up, as an undergraduate team, for the                 collegiate division of the iGEM competition.
2.- Deliverables:
Team wiki: We have made a fully-responsive, user friendly wiki viewable in                 almost any modern device.
Poster: We are looking forward to and planning for a visit to the Giant Jamboree                 to present our poster for other teams.
Presentation: We are looking forward to presenting our project to the iGEM                 community at the Giant Jamboree.
Project attribution: We have created a page on our wiki with the attributions                 of each aspect of the project. Click here to view it.
Registry part pages: Our registry of parts was completed. Click here to view it.
Sample submission: Our submission of samples was made. You can see the submitted parts on the 4th requirement below: Part/Contribution Safety forms: Our safety form was completed
Judging form: Our judging form was completed
3.- Attribution: We created a page to attribute work done by students, advisors, host labs,                 instructors, web designers and translators. Please see our attribution page for more information.
4.- Part/contribution: One of our goals is to relate the amount of protein expression with quantity                 of reflectin expressed in the outer layer of our cells. We had to use BBa_K2069000 and BBa_K2069001 as intermediate parts to achieve our                 objetives in our chassis. The promoter used was T7, there was no information prior to our research in which                 this promoter was used to express a protein on M. xanthus, the host cell that we are introducing as a chasis.                 The parts were submitted on the pSB1C3 backbone. More details can be found on our iGEM parts registry page.
Silver
1.- Validated part/validated contribution: We have validated the biobrick part BBa_K2069007 through our experiments carried out with a sensor that allowed us to measure light reflection on a very sensitive                 level, developing data that was implemented in a mathematical model used to make a direct relationship with                 the expression of an anti-fungal protein in myxobacteria, which is the cell used as chassis for the experiments.                 In this way, we could make predictions and adjustments based on the risk level that protein over expression                 could lead to. Please see our page for more information .
2.- Collaboration: See our collaboration page to know more about the teams we had the opportunity to collaborate with .
3.- Human practices: Our team is really excited and proud of what we have accomplished in the                 Human Practices area. We started by developing an analysis where synthetic biology was studied in three aspects:                 economic, legal and ethical. From every approach, we encountered several issues like openness, democracy,                 IP conflict, winner takes all economy, social responsibility, biosecurity and involuntary risks. Each of                 these problematics was addressed with a possible solution or explanation and was considered in the creation                 of nine guidelines that should be implemented when regulating or even working with synthetic biology. Nevertheless                 we did not stop there, the team decided to develop activities that served as practical solutions to some                 of the issues as well as a confirmation to what had already been researched and analyzed.
Some of the                 problems we addressed were: the lack of information and diffusion, the farmers’ feeling of exclusion towards                 biotechnology/synthetic biology and the limited visualization of the impact of our project. Here we have                 enlisted the activities that helped us:
We created an event at the facilities of our college called “Café Con Ciencia: Myxobacteria as biological                         control method for phytopathogenic fungi in crops” where we exposed to alumni, professors and general                         public what our project was about.
With the objective of increasing dialogue, diffusion and public discussion we interviewed and exchanged                         information with several farmers in our region. We explained what biotechnology and synthetic biology                         are about and what we intended to do with our project, while the farmers gave us data of their crops,                         taught us about the problems they normally face at agriculture and their personal points of view                         of our project.
The team decided to address the farmer´s feeling of exclusion by organizing several visits to their farms.                         This helped us realize their problems in flesh and visualize a broader picture of what we could do                         in a future with our project and synthetic biology. For more information, please see our HP page .
As part of our intent to increase our diffusion we participated and collaborated in the Guanajuato Meet-up. This event consisted in the gathering of several Mexican iGem teams, where we had the chance to spread the word about our project, reaching people out of our region.
