I am a 5th semester student of Biotechnology Engineering . Although I have  participated in other competitions,  iGEM is the first scientific competition in which I participated since I began studying at Tec. I am violinist and I have many other hobbies but I enjoy them even more when I can share them with people I love as my boyfriend, family, friends and of course the iGEM team :)  I'm excited to be part of such an amazing team!

I love doing labwork and everything that's involved with it.
