Productora 206 took pictures of us in some events and they are simply gorgeous. They would be the perfect paparazzis.

Agricultors provided us with knowledge and contacts but most important, they took the time to listen                             about our project. To every person that agreed to be interviewed and taught us so much about                             the agricultural sector: Thanks for all your support and availability!
SnapGene software was available for Tec-Chihuahua to model our project. Thanks to Snap Gene Team!

Our Work
Every team member has done great things to aid in the development of each project, we strive to properly credit each             with what they did the most, but simple words are never enough to represent the inmense help they have done for             every area.
