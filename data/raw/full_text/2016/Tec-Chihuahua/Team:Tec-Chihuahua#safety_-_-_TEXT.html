Safety
Personal Protective Equipment
In the lab we use lab coats, masks and nitrile gloves in order to prevent contact with aerosols, droplets and splashes that might be generated during the experiments.
Personal belongings are kept separate from where the potentially infectious materials are being handled.
PPE is removed when leaving the lab
We have always disinfected our hands with 70% ethanol before and after putting the nitrile gloves on as well as wash our hands when we enter the lab.
Biological Safety Cabinets
In the lab we use biological safety cabinets in order to prevent us to get in contact with the samples that are being analyzed as well as protecting them from getting contaminated.  Every time we make use of the biological safety cabinets, we first sterilize it by leaving the UV light on for 15 minutes with the material that's going to be used in the protocols, we also disinfect our hands with 70% ethanol before getting them into the cabinet, and clean it every time we finish using it.
Open Bench: Using Burners to create a sterile zone
When working in open bench, we first have to sterilize the area with 70% ethanol and use of burners to create a sterile zone specially while managing microorganisms.

Wet Lab: Decontamination and Waste Management
Waste must be managed in different ways depending on what is going to be disposed. Sharp objects must be disposed in a red thick plastic bottle, biological wastes such as fluids must be disposed in a yellow hermetic bottle, solid biological wastes in a yellow bag, and objects that have been in contact with bacteria or other infectious agents should be disposed in a red bag.
We worked on a Containment Level 2 Laboratory, with lockable doors and previous training to handle materials, equipments and biosafety. Benches are covered in varnish (non-absorbent material). The access to the laboratory is restricted to Biotechnology alumni and our Faculty teachers.
Safety
Safety must be of great importance while working in the laboratory, thatâ€™s why we made sure to be informed about safety in the laboratory before starting to work with the experimental protocols and manipulate the microorganisms that were going to be used throughout our project because we knew that this involved certain risks if managed incorrectly.
Biosafety (organisms)
Our project involves the use of these organisms:
Bacteria
Myxobacteria
Fungus
Rhizoctonia solani
Fusaruim sp.
Rhizopus sp.
We knew that the management of this microorganisms involved certain risks for us if they weren't handled and disposed in the correct way, that's why we took some security measures such as using gloves, facemasks, and lab coats while working with these microorganisms. Another safety measure was to make sure that our area was sterile before and after their manipulation, and disposing them in the correct way (sealing petri dishes, chlorinating broth and used sterile micropipette tips, and eppendorf tubes).
