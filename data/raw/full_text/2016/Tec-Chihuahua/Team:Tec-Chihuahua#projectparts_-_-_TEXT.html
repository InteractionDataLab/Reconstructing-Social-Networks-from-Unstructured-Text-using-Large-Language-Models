BBa_K541506:  Reflectin 1A from cephalopod
This part is the Coding Sequence of a self-assembling protein that has the capacity to reflect sunlight, depending on the thickness of the protein layer, it is expressed on the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria. This protein will be used to measure protein expression.

BBa_K525998: T7 promoter + RBS
This part contains the phage T7 promoter along with the BBa_B0034 Ribosome Binding Site. This specific promoter was chosen for overexpression and capacity of the Myxobateria RNA polymerase to read phage promoters, such as T7.

BBa_K1364007: RBS + Antifungal GAFP-1 + Double terminator
This part encodes a translational unit that contains the BBa_K780002 RBS, which is a strong promoter on Bacillus subtilis, but works with a strength of 10.13% relative to the BBa_B0032 RBS on E. coli; and the CDS of Gastrodia anti-fungal protein, which is a mannose and chitin binding lectin originating from the Asiatic orchid Gastrodia elata that is able to inhibit the growth of multiples species of plant pathogenic fungi. This part also includes two terminators, B0010 and B0012.

BBa_K2069005: sem2
This intermediate part also allows the easy assembly for expression of chaperonin 60 (along with chaperonin 10 provides resistance to high temperatures), CspC (it provides resistance to low temperatures) and GAFP-1 (antifungal protein from Gastrodia elata)

BBa_K2069006: Biobrick
This part consists of a Cpn10/Cpn60 system of proteins and a CspC protein to provide resistance to temperature. It also expresses an antifungic gene, GAFP-1 from Gastrodia, cephalopod Reflectin 1A and expression is regulated by a T7 promoter.
