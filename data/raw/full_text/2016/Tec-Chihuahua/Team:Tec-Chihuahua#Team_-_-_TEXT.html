Team
Our team consists of students from third to seventh semester, we're all hard-working classmates inside the lab and great friends outside the lab, always united via our common love for science and technology.
Abraham
I'm 20 years old, I study the 5th semester of my biotechnology major and I'm currently the leader of this amazing team. Some of the things that I love are: the lab life, bodybuilding, skating, hip-hop, eating, sports, gaming and success.
Ana Vic
I am a 5th semester student of Biotechnology Engineering. Although I have participated in other competitions,  iGEM is the first scientific competition in which I participate since I began studying at Tec. I am violinist and I have many other hobbies, but I enjoy them even more when I can share them with people I love. I'm excited to be part of such an amazing team!
Andrea
I am an 18 year old student, right now on my 3rd semester of Biotechnology Engineering. Besides science I’m into music, I like to play different instruments in my free time. My family and friends are the most important thing to me, so I try to spend the short time I’m not in the lab with them.
Armando
I'm a 19 year old 3rd semester student of biotechnology engineering. A lot of people consider me an intriguing and random person and I consider this a key aspect of my personality. When I have free time some of the things I enjoy doing are going to the gym, reading everything that I find interesting, watching series, and listening to dope music. I love doing labwork and everything that's involved with it.

Some of my hobbies are dancing, listening to music, riding horses and enjoying nature, that’s why I would like to focus my career on agricultural or veterinary aspects.
