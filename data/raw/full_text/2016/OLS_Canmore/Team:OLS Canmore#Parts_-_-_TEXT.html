PARTS
This year we did not add any new parts to the registry since we created parts pages for all of them while working on the same project last year.  However, we did expand on the characterization of these parts and add to the documentation for all of them.
Last year, only the sequences were added to the registry as we were unable to create the actual biobrick.  This year we successfully created the actual composite biobrick parts in the lab but as we are writing this (Oct. 19th) they have not yet been submitted.  However, we plan to ship them for the October 21st deadline.
