GOLD MEDAL REQUIREMENTS
In addition to the bronze and gold requirements we met we also met two gold metal requirements:
We achieved the goal standard of integrated human practice; by connecting with different industries that could be affected by our construct and using their input to positively affect our project and help us to develop. For example we spoke with wastewater treatment facilities and this is how we originally came up with the idea for out bioreactor implementation. For more information visit our integrated human practices page.
Over the past two years we have improved upon the work of two other teams for our two constructs; KERA and KERUS. Keratinase A (KERA), an enzyme optimized to degrade hair was originally developed by the university of Sheffield in 2014, and the second Keratinase US (KERUS) which specialized and was originally developed in 2013 by the University of Chicago. We improved upon both of these projects by optimizing each part (see design and biobrick pages) in order to avoid encountering the same problems as the two other teams had in the past.
