We submitted one part to the registry. However, we designed four total plasmids, three of which we were unable to prepare samples of by the submission deadline.
BBa_K2176002
This plasmid contains KaiC fused to a Gal4 activation domain, with a self-cleaving peptide linker, P2A, fusing it to KaiB. P2A cleaves itself during translation, causing the KaiC-Gal4AD and the KaiB to separate. We did this to allow us to control the exact ratio of KaiC, KaiB, and KaiA, and make sure it is constant and equal in every cell.
