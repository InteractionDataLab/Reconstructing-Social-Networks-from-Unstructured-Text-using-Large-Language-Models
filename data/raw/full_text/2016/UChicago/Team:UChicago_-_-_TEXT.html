OUR PROJECT
KaiABC
Disrupted circadian timing plays a role in many human diseases, yet designing interventions that specifically target circadian malfunction remains a challenge. It may be possible to restore circadian timing in animals transgenically using an oscillator network based on the KaiABC system, which consists of three core proteins that generate a 24-hour circadian clock endogenous to the cyanobacterium Synechocococcus elongatus. Successfully transplanting this dynamic system from prokaryotes to eukaryotes would represent an important step towards potential therapeutic treatment. Our project focused on expressing this system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
