We were able to demonstrate that cyanobacterial KaiA and cyanobacterial KaiC express in yeast by cloning the KaiA and KaiC genes directly out of cyanobacteria, transforming them into yeast, and running the Western blots shown below.
Due to manufacturing issues beyond our teamâ€™s control, we were not able to generate more results before the Wikifreeze deadline. See our presentation at the Jamboree for more results!
