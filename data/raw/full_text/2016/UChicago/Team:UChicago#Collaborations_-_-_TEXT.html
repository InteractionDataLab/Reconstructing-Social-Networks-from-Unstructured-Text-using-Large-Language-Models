As one of the only teams working with yeast, we had difficulty finding another iGEM team with whom to troubleshoot research and/or design issues. However, one of our goals this summer was to assess and expand public knowledge about synthetic biology through education and outreach, and in order to achieve this it is important that scientists be equally aware and up-to-date in their understanding of the field. To this effect, we have participated in two surveys assessing our understanding of various aspects of synthetic biology work.
We participated in the outreach efforts of the following teams:
Virginia
University of Virginia iGEM created a survey about biocontainment practices and knowledge, titled "Virginia iGEM Biocontainment Survey," which our team participated in.
Munich United
Munich United created a survey on entrepreneurship in iGEM entitled "Enabling Factors in Biotech." Our team participated in this survey as well.
