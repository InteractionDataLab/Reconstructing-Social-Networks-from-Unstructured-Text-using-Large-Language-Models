Human Practice
As our human practice works are dynamic in term of activity and diverse in term of targetted participants, we design our programs not only to fulfill the goals we tried to achieve but also to integrate each program by connecting one to another.  By connecting one to another, it ease us to see how our program benefit not only one targetted group or participants only. It also does ease us in term of getting findings and feedback for our social study.
