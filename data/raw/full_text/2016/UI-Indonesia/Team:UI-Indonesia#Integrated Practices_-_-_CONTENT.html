Thus, to answer that our human practice works are integrated from social study, education to public engagement program. We designed media such as flyer and handbook to support our human practice works. The result is proposing HIV-related education helps to leverage the awareness and to correct the misconception regarding HIV/AIDS, thus it can be a powerful tool to deprive the stigma about PLWHA and it will make the innovation in HIV treatment becoming easier because people will not stigmatize HIV/AIDS and people who suffer HIV/AIDS. We successfully delivered our human practice works to people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and non-PLWHA from community level (Public Discussion Forum in Pekayon, East Jakarta) to national level (Education Fair held by Ministry of Education Republic of Indonesia, and a national seminar ‘Synbio Day’ held by our team).</P><H2 class="text-center">Education</H2><P>---</P><H3 class="text-center">National Education Day</H3><P>Coinciding with the celebration of National Education of Indonesia, the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia in cooperation with 112 social organization, education activists, and public figures organized an event called &quot;Pesta Pendidikan (Education Fair) 2016&quot;. This national-scaled events was held in March, 1st 2016 at FX Sudirman, Jakarta. The main theme of the event is “Everyone is Learner Everyone is Teacher” (Semua murid semu guru). The fair consisted of minor events. Minor events are consisted of Gallery Walk, Talkshow, Fun Run, Music Concert, Games, and many more. This events was not only attended by people from many different interests people and students, but also attended by public figures and Indonesian Minister of education and Culture, Mr. Anies Baswedan. This events also covered by some national TV station, like Kompas TV, Metro TV, Indosiar, and many more.</P><P>As our social engagement and education contribution, UI-Indonesia team contributed in this events. We participated in gallery walk. Gallery walk is an information show and an interesting education tool for attenders. We made a Gallery Walk which contains interactive information boards about synthetic biology, HIV, and Hi-Vax as our project. The aim of the Gallery walk is to introduce and attract people’s interest about synthetic biology, and also to introduce about our research project. We also made interesting display and figure about how synthetic biology works. The intensities of the audiences was high, they were really interested to learn further about synthetic biology. Even almost all of them were wanted to be informed more about advanced synthetic biology. They also gave us support</P><P class="kuvateksti text-center">

We see this as a chance for us to introduce them not only to the amazing world of biology but also to the cool progress of synthetic biology. We successfully delivered the material about basic synthetic biology and its latest cool and fun application that easily took the students’s attention, i.e. glowing plants. We provided the students with the guidebook to our presentation and group discussions. Group discussion was brought by the method of storytelling to make the students can grasp the concept of basic synthetic biology in simple but fun way. </P><P class="kuvateksti text-center">

			</P><H3 class="text-center"> Website Synbio.id </H3><P> Indonesia is the fourth largest country in the world. It has more than 250 million people, and about 50 % of total population is student. For a country that has that numerous student in population, Indonesia should have a good education system that can facilitate everyone to learn every subject they interested in.  One example is synthetic biology. We know that synthetic biology is an interesting subject, but it isn’t yet concluded in Indonesian curriculum system, even in biology subject. Moreover, Indonesia doesn’t have any website or learning tools that provide complete and comprehensive information about synthetic biology. </P><P>Based on that condition, as part of our contribution to education, we, UI-Indonesia team are trying to build a website which contains everything about synthetic biology. This website is expected to be a pioneer in synthetic biology education. We named the website “synbio-id”, which is the abbreviation of “synthetic biology Indonesia”. The website is available in url www.synbio-id.com.  With the tagline “synthetizing Indonesian scientist”, this website will provide articles, posters, pictures, videos, and other interesting facts and informations about synthetic biology. </P><P> Our website has some menus, </P><P class="kuvateksti text-center">

To expand our target of education, Synbio Day 2016 was assembled in four different sessions. Each was wrapped up in four different youth-friendly ways to spark interest among university students and academics from various discipline backgrounds. Rather than just conducting sessions with bored-mediocre scientific topics, we mainly discussed about Indonesia’s social and culture perception that linked to technology development regarding to the perspective towards people with HIV/AIDS and HIV/AIDS vaccine.</P><P>University students are flexible and have the power to reach out all levels of society, from the government to the needy. That is why we are certain that they are essensial target to reach. With empathy and the quality of critical thinking, uni students and academics can determine which suitable way to approach the people and to make recommendations for the government.</P><P>Attended by people from Jakarta to Sumbawa, Synbio Day 2016 was a big success which was independently run by only 14 iGEM members.

In Pekayon, East Jakarta, we successfully delivered a public discussion in a small group discussion model which benefit the participants in term of understanding the material being given and discussed. Furthermore, the discussion forum that we held got the good response from the citizens who participated in the forum. The “Jumantik” (peer health counselor) asked us to do the similar discussion model to the their each represented neighbourhood.</P><P class="kuvateksti text-center"> Public Discussion in Pekayon
