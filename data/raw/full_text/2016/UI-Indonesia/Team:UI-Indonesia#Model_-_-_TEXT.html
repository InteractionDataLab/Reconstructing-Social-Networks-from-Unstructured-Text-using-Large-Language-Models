MODELLING
Mathematical modelling and simulation division working on how to visualized what happened in laboratory by creating the mathematical equation that shows a correlation between all components in this research. Through learning the previous research on modelling the kinetics in HIV/AIDS, we collect found parameters to form the complete equation. This equation consist of the rate of white-blood cells forming, CD4, and rate of virus clearance and rate of the change of infected T celss into healthy cells
HERE is the complete equation in our mathematical modelling and simulation
