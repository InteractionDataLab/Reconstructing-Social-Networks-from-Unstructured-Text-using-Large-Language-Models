Their project idea is about producing biobutanol from empty palm fruit bunch (EPFB). Their team consist of various universities in Indonesia; University of Indonesia (UI – Depok, West Java), University of Gadjah Mada (UGM - Jogjakarta), University of Airlangga (Unair – Surabaya, East Java), University of Brawijaya (UB – Malang, East Java), and Sepuluh November Institute of Technology (ITS – Surabaya, East Java). </P><P>Because of the team’s uniqueness that comes from the collaboration within various universities and also their project track in energy, we believe it is important to give mentorship in the topic of fundraising and human practice. As for fundraising, our experiences for the past 8 months showed us that a early readiness in preparation of fundraising activity had ease our way to finish our ‘first’ challenge in iGEM which is paying the registration fee on time while we only had 4 months to prepare and do the fundraising activities. The struggle regarding the funding is that the amount we have to pay quite huge in our currency to be converted to US dollar. That’s why we came up with this topic to figure out what kind of fundraising activity that might suit them since their team is consisted of various universities’ member. We explained it by giving an example of our team sponsorship’s proposal, how-to-do fundraising presentation to future sponsor company, and how we can make several human practice activities, i.e. Synbio Day, Public Discussion Forum, etc., beneficial to our sponsor company too.</P><P>Mentoring New iGEM Team &amp; Future ITS Synthetic Biology Community

                </P><P>As for human practice, we believe it is important to discuss the strategic field of their social studies. We explained about how to specify the social study within iGEM project that deals in various sectors. Because of their team’s project runs in the energy track and energy, especially renewable energy, itself is a heated issue in Indonesia, we believe it’s necessary for them to specify which area of topics that brings their project into a highlight as Indonesia itself is very heterogenous in structure of society and very dynamic in term of political and economical condition. </P><P>Mentoring New iGEM Team: Fundraising and How to Integrate It in HP Works

One of iGEM IGN team member, Evan from ITS, stated that he comes from university which has no study club that focus in synthetic biology, thus he’s interested in our synthetic biology community, Universitas Indonesia Synthetic Biology Club (www.uisynbio.com). Our synthetic biology community has consistently spread awareness and has educated through synthetic biology class not only for students in our campus, but also other campus to learn and discuss about topics related to synthetic biology. Our iGEM teams for the past four years are born within this community, so it’s very exciting for us to also explain how our community started and run independently by students. Luckily, one of our iGEM team member, Aulia (Human Practice member), was once a treasurer for a second year UI Synbio Club founded, so we believe her hands-on experiences in dealing with funding and managing synthetic biology community would help Evan and his friends to start their own synthetic biology community in their campus.</P><P> iGEM IGN Bioscience 2017 team member: </P><UL><LI>Team Leader: Sahal Sabilil Muttaqin (UGM)
