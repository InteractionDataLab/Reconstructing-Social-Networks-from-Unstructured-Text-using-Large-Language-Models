Proof of Concept
We spent the entire Summer in the lab, and such hard work resulted in some achievements.      We have submitted parts to the registry, experimentally validated our new BioBrick devices and demonstrated the assembly of our design and fulfilled the criteria for a gold medal.

Featured Parts
BBa_K2054000 - ssDNAs of our nanostructure
Forwarding our all submitted parts, we agree that it would be better if there is mighty single biobrick that encodes the all components of our desired structure.                    And here we have it – putting all together .
BBa_K2054006 - ssDNAs of our simplified nanostructure
Oligos 1 and 5 are in a single plasmid to encode for the simplified version of our nanostructure.

For Gold Medal
✓
Inspired from an integrated Human Practice
The concept DNA nanostructure assembly and miRNA detection were integrated into our public exhibition at The 49th Joint School Science Exhibition.                  Feedbacks from visitors offered us great inspiration the future application of our constructs and the potential social impacts of our project.                 The creation of the Facebook video  "Biosafety and Research Ethics- Conversation with Profession Danny Chan" inspired us to conduct a thorough risk assessment on E. coli DH10beta, which is a crucial component of our project.
✓
Demostrate the proof of concept
We used our nanostructure to test on the RNA inputs and mutants and our nanostructure worked as expected.
✓
Demonstrate
Our nanostructure passed tests on RNA inputs to fulfill real life condition.
