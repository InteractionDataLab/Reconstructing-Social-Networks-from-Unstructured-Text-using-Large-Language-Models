Working with Rice University
This year we are pleased to work with Rice University (yes, again!)
We helped Rice iGEM team characterized two promoters. Dose and temporal responses of 2 variants of T7-promoters were investigated. The data gathered provided insights on the use of promoters that could lead to higher yield of the gene product.
Figure 1. Dose and temporal responses of T7-promoter variants, G6 and H10. Error bars represent SD of 3 independent experiments.
G6 varient allow detectable gene expression faster and stonger than that of H10 varient. The results indicated that the G6 varient is a stronger promoter compare with H10 vairent. These information provide insight on the selection of promoters that will be used in Rice's iGEM team experiment.
Please visit the protocol to get more information on the experiment.
