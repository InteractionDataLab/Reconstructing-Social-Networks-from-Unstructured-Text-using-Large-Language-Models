Modelling
In addition to the collaboration with NUS, we are grateful to work with IIT Madras on modelling and simulation of our project. IIT Madras performed a mathematical analysis on the tristable system model, and revealed a surprising behaviour of the switch – Oscillation occurs under certain conditions.
The analysis commences with a Boolean model and proved the existence of oscillation performed by the tristable system. A more elaborated model based on ODE was formulated to further characterise the oscillatory behaviour of the system. This further confines the conditions at which oscillation occurs, as well as identifying the parameters controlling the magnitude of the oscillation.
Their findings on these additional behaviours of the switch further our understanding on the system; and hence, allowing us to fine tune if no further functions are added to the circuit design.

Human Practices
IIT Madras iGEM team creates a game, Codonut, to teach the players about the codon optimization phenomena which boosts the protein expression during protein synthesis by means of the ribosomal machinery in the cells so that the translational efficiency of the gene of interest can be elevated. Our team tried the game and found that it is really educational and informative. To help them optimize the game, we gave some comments and solutions towards several problems, like technical issues and tactics for attracting more players.
This game is highly recommended for diving into the molecular world in biology. If you are interested, please go to:
