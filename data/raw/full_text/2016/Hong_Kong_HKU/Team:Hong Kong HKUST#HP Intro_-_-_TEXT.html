Human Practices - Introduction
Our team this year focused on designing a synbio product – a useful application based on the Tristable Switch for the public. We researched and consulted the experts in the synbio field to polish up our design.
Other areas that we worked on include, education through teaching secondary school students, exploring intellectual property right policies, and assisting other iGEM teams in planning.
