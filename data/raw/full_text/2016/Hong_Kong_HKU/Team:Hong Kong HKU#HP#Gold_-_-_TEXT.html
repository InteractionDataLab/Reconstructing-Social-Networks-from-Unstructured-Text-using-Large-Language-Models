We conducted an interview with Professor Danny Chan upon biosafety in September, 2016.     Professor Chan is the Assistant Dean (Research Postgraduate Studies) of the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong.
The interview focused mainly on the biological research laboratory safety, related regulations and research ethics.     He emphasized the importance of educating incoming students on lab safety.      For instance, there is an orientation talk hosted by the safety office for all new postgraduates.      The postgraduates are required to pass a safety test before entering the laboratories.      In addition, he gave his opinion on the impact of current Hong Kong regulations towards scientific research development.      He does not think that the regulations hinder scientific research as the purpose of the regulations is to protect the general public from any laboratory accidents.      This following is a complete recording of our conversation with Professor Danny Chan.

After the filming of the interview, the representatives had a conversation upon E. coli, which we are using as part of our project.      He suggested us doing a risk assessment against the strain that we are using.      Therefore, here we present the risk assessment of the mentioned strain, relating to our project.
Epilogue by Prof. Chan:
“Well, I hope you love your project. Get HKU a Gold Medal and something special this year”.
And this is what we are striving for.
