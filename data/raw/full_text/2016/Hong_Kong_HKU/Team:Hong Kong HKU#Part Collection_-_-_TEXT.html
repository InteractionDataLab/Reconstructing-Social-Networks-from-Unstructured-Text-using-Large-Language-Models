Proof of Concept
We were prounded to present a part collection consists of 7 parts, of 2 composite parts in addition to 5 basic parts.
These are all you need to have your tetrahedron nanostructure so we included all as a package.
All of the mentioned parts were submitted to the registry and they are listed below.
They characteristics could be found on the links on their part numbers respectively.
