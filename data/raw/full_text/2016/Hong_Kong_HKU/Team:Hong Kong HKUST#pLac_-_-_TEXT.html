lacp Module
The lacp module consists of a Lac repressible promoter upstream of the CDSs of TetR and PhlF, which are then followed by the reporter gene, sfGFP. When lacp is activated, the two repressor proteins, TetR and PhlF will be expressed along with the reporter gene, sfGFP. This results in the repression of the two other modules in our system, phlFp and tetp.

Promoter, Repressor and Inducer Specification
Promoter name: lacp (Lac repressible promoter)
Length: 200 base pairs
Strength with:
Weak RBS (BBa_B0032): 290.27-195.5 (+17.7) RPU
Medium RBS (BBa_B0030): 11.347-9456(+487) RPU
Strong RBS (BBa_B0034): 1.126-7648 (+152) RPU
In gram negative bacteria, LacI represses lacp which regulates the binding of RNA polymerase and inhibits transcription by binding to the lac operon.
Repressor name: LacI (LacI repressor)
Part Length: 1153 base pairs
Structure: Homo-tetramer
Binding affinity: To lacp, very tight, 60.145M
The LacI repressor is an allosteric protein exists in 2 states: silent and active. In the absence of inducers, the active state of LacI binds to the lac operator sites of the lacp promoter and interferes the binding the RNA polymerase, thus inhibiting transcription. In the presence of inducers, however, LacI undergoes allosteric rearrangement and switches to its silent state, resulting in its release from the promoter, thus allowing transcription to take place.
Inducer name: IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside)
Effective Concentration : 20 ng/ml
In our project,  Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was used to induce lacp driven expressions. IPTG is a lactose metabolite, lacp’s native inducer, which has shown stronger binding affinity to LacI. On top of that, it cannot be metabolized by Escherichia coli so it concentration remains constant during the experiment, making it a more suitable inducer for our Tristable Switch system.
Mechanism of lacp - LacI - IPTG Interaction
Figure 2. Behaviour of LacI in the presence/absence of IPTG
In the absence of IPTG, LacI would bind to lacp, inhibiting transcription and thus bringing sfGFP expression to a halt. In the presence of IPTG, however, LacI would lose the ability to bind to lacp, allowing transcription to proceed, resulting sfGFP expression.
