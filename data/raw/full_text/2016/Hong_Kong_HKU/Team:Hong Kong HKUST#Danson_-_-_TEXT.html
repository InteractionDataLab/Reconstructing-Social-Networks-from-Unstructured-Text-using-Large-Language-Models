Abstract
The Tristable switch was derived from advanced studies of other synthetic networks like toggle switches and oscillators. We think it would be helpful to create a synthetic network which produces distinct signals under specific induction. We hope to create a biological device that could perform three discrete, but alternating, steady states driven by three different repressible promoters. The presence of a transient pulse of inducer allows effective state shifting, while preventing signal interference. During data-mining, we noticed that iGEM Team Brown University has tried to build tristable switches in 2006 and 2007 but had low outputs. Therefore, we troubleshot and investigated improvements that can be applied to their design.
