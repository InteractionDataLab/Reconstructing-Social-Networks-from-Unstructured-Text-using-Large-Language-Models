Safety
Mainly focusing on the investigation of the properties and the future usages of the Tristable Switch, we did not have to release the bacterial chassis to the field. In the meantime, prioritizing safety of our project, we strictly followed all the instructions from the iGEM Headquarter and our school to avoid causing any potential risks.

UNIVERSITY SAFETY
Health, Safety & Environment Office (HSEO) is responsible for safety regulations at our institution, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HKUST. All of the team members absolutely complied with the guidelines from the HSEO so as to ensure the safety inside and outside the laboratory.
The biosafety guideline of our institution can be directed to here .
The regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories in Hong Kong can be directed to here .
SAFETY TRAINING
This year's HKUST iGEM team members received safety training before the start of our project. Topics that we learned about in the safety training are as follows:
1. Biological Safety
2. Chemical Safety I/ Chemical Safety for Laboratory Users
3. Chemical Safety II/ Hazardous Waste Management
The link to the laboratory safety training requirements of our institution (The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HKUST) can be directed to here .
