Mentoring Local High School Team
United Christian College (Kowloon East) in Hong Kong is the first high school in Hong Kong to participate in iGEM.            Since its establishment, HKU Team has been mentoring this new team which we believe will be the role model for future high school iGEM teams in Hong Kong.            We provided this team of budding synthetic biologists administrative guidance through regular joint-team meetings,            helped them with their ideas developing stage and offered them technical support in later stages of their project.            It was our pleasure to share our 7 years of iGEM experience with the UCCKE team.
We were impressed by the fascinating new ideas from UCCKE team in the brainstorm session held in March at HKU.            Our team members gave UCCKE team some advices on iGEM and commented on their project designs.             Another meeting was held in August, in which we focused on troubleshooting and laboratory collaboration.
We have delivered a sharing session at their school as well to provide another perspective in synthetic biology to more high school students.
Global Collaborations
In emphasizing the ‘I’ in the iGEM, we have been very active in seeking collaborations between local institutes as well as international ones.              We approached teams from several universities worldwide to seek possible inter-institute collaborations, these includes Dundee University, Imperial College London, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich) and National University of Singapore.
At the end of the day, we helped NUS to distribute over 100 questionnaires on the issue of cancer treatment at HKU.              This act helps NUS to collect data oversea and obtain an alternative perspective.
