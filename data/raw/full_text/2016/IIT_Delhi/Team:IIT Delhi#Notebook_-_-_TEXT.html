30th may to 7th june
Discussion on our project and the proposal sent to iBEC (Indian biological engineering competition).
31/05/16
Transformation of 4 plasmids using electroporation (Only 2microL of each part was used):
2H6 - BBa_R0062 - PLux
5D7 - BBa_K1399002 - RFP
2L4 - BBa_C0062 - LuxR
2J4 - BBa_C0061 - LuxI
Due to insufficient cell growth on 2 of the 4 plates transformed only 2 will be inoculated and the other 2 have to be redone.
This implies inadequate amount of plasmids were transformed. For further processes amount of plasmid used would be around 5-6 microL
Computation: Modelling of the Danino oscillator for a single cell.
02/06/16
Plasmid isolation of the 2 cell cultures.
04/06/16
Transformation using TSS protocol of '2 new plasmids' and '2 earlier used plasmids (insufficient cell growth)' respectively:
2L4 - BBa_C0062 - LuxR
2J4 - BBa_C0061 - LuxI
2H4 - BBa_C0060 - aiiA with degradation tag
2B4 - BBa_C0051 - lambda cI
05/06/16
Computation: Discussion on Second order partial derivatives in delay differential equations.
Lab: All 4 plates show colonies, although on one of the plates (aiiA with degradation tag part), one of the colonies does not look like a typical E.coli colony, and is transparent instead of being opaque. Anyway, we inoculated colonies from all 4 plates into LB containing tubes.  Hopefully all 4 will show growth tomorrow. That would be confirmation enough whether the colony is proper or not. Also, we found the P+RBS (constitutive) from last year. We’ll transform that tomorrow to save it and then use it for cloning in our project. We have also isolated a transcriptional terminator for our parts, which we will pick up from the kits tomorrow and use.
06/06/16
Transformation of 4 new plasmids: 1.
2L6 - BBa_R0065 - lambda cI and luxR
2.
3F3 - Bba_B0015 - Terminator
3.
P+RBS - J23119 and RBS
4.
5H1 - BBa_B0030 - RBS
5.
From 8th june to 15th june
08/06/16
Inoculation of 3 cell colonies having the following gene plasmids:
2L6 - BBa_R0065 - lambda cI and luxR promotor
3F3 - Bba_B0015 - Terminator
P+RBS - J23119 and RBS
The culture with the 4th plasmid didn't have sufficient growth. It has to be redone.
09/06/16
Plasmid isolation of the following genes:
2L6 - BBa_R0065 - λcI and luxR promotor
3F3 - Bba_B0015 - Terminator
P+RBS - J23119 and RBS

Gel run-
1% gel (Agarose in TAE)
Ethidium Bromide as staining dye for UV visibility
3 uL plasmid + 0.6 uL loading buffer (glycerol)
Plasmid + Backbone = Total size 1st row:                                                    Ladder (1kb)
5D7 - BBa_K1399002 - RFP
714 bp + 2070 bp   =  2784 bp
2B4 - BBa_C0051 - lambda cI
775 bp + 2070 bp   =  2845 bp
3F3 - Bba_B0015 - Terminator
129 bp + 2070 bp   =  2199 bp
2H6 - BBa_R0062 - PLuxR
55 bp + 2070 bp   =  2125 bp
2H4 - BBa_C0060 - aiiA
814 bp + 2070 bp   =  2884 bp
2L6 - BBa_R0065 - P lux-λ
97 bp + 2070 bp   =  2167 bp
2J4 - BBa_C0061 - LuxI
643 bp + 2070 bp   =  2713 bp
2nd row:
2L4 - BBa_C0062 - LuxR
781 bp + 2070 bp   =  2851 bp
Bba_K880005 - J23119 and RBS
55 bp + 2070 bp   =  2125 bp
PSB1C3 (Backbone) size:  2070 bp
All the plasmids except double terminator and LuxI showed results. This maybe because the colonies obtained of the double terminator were of green colour and the concentration of LuxI plasmid was too low.
Digestion of all the plasmids was done except the double terminator.

Strong RBS:             1000 colonies (lawn)
5O4  LuxR(2013):    No growth as expected (Ampicillin resistance)
2L4   LuxR(2105):    20 colonies
3F3  Double Term: 100 colonies, slightly better than last time (not green)
3F3  Double Term: Colonies there but medium ruptured
20/06/16
Important discussion on the project.
The process of producing a cloned gene in a cell culture starting from the kit plates provided by iGEM was discussed in detail. Every possible limitation and benefit of the processes came up during the discussion. This gave us a clearer view of how and why theses steps were performed and also how to overcome a limitation or problem that was encountered in them.
Then we discussed our progress till now and planned our tasks for the next few days.

• 1st time with gblocks.
• LuxI and LuxR were verified on gel.
• Problem with desalting possible.
• Enzymes are not working properly on DNA.

Preparing LA plates by putting 2 flasks of 300ml failed  Somehow heat was not enough for their boiling but enough for the charring.  It took much longer to boil them and in one them because of improper mixing and late boiling (which ultimately helps in mixing) led to charring of chunk of mass.

Single digestion of same plasmids  with pst1 of LIR - 1 and 4 - to verify
Digestion of false clones to check what they really are.

There is turbidity in our buffer2.1.
All this time problems might be because of bufffer2.1
Digestion = 20ul 0f 1C3 and 1K3
5.Digestion of LIR = 40ul
There was no smear in the gel.
While eluting 1C3 some of the ladder was also taken
6.Digestion of PL-PR = 40ul
7.Digestion of psb3t5 -E/P= 50ul
