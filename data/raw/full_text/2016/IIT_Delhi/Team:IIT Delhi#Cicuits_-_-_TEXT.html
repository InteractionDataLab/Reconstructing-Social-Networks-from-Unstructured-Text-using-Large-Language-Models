Oscillator Circuits
The aim of synthetic biology is to design and synthesize biological networks that  perform desired funtions in a predictable manner. A significant chunk of workin synthetic biology has focused on the construction of two important type of  networks: switches and oscillators. Synthetic biology is at the intersection of  biology, engineering and computational mathematics. Consequently, there are two  distinct aspects to the design, analysis and implementation of a synthetic circuit:  in-silico and in-vivo validation. Under the in-silico paradigm, we forego the specific  implementational details, rather we are focused on the abstract mathematical  model and the dynamical behavior such a model allows. While for in-vivo analysis,  we work on identyfing the specific biological components that can be used to  implement the identified topology for the synthetic network. Here, we look at  both these aspects for the Danino Oscillator [4].

We’ll give a very brief overview of the Goodwin and the Amplified negative feed- back oscillators . The Danino Oscillator is essentially a quorum sensing version of the Amplified negative feedback oscillator.
Goodwin Oscillator - This was the first synthetic genetic oscillator to be  studied. It consists of a single gene with negative autoregulation. Models  suggest that oscillations occur in the goodwin oscillator if repression is mod- elled by a nonlinear Hill function with a high cooperativity coefficient [3].  Further, this oscillator has been shown to have a robust time period.
Amplified negative feedback oscillator Leaving aside the biological im- plementation, this abstract topology is the one used in the Danino Oscillator.Under this architecture, the activator gene A activates it’s own repressor gene  B. In the Daanino oscillator there is a latent phase when both the activator  and repressor accumulate, thus allowing large amplitudes to be achived for  this configuration.The qualitative behavior of this oscillator is discussed in  the modelling section using the mathematical model suggested in [4]. One  crucial benefit that the Danino oscillator has over this topology is the prop- erty of quorum sensing; the AHL molecule can diffuse across the cell mem- brane and be exchange with neighbouring cells. This offers a mechanism to  synchronize the oscillators.
