Mathematical Modelling
Increasingly mathematical modelling is becoming a crucial part of synthetic biology. Mathematical modelling and simulations implementing those models play a  pivotal role between the concept and realization of a biological circuit. Specifically, mathematical modeling can serve two distinct tasks: offering a detailed  understanding of the dynamics of a biological circuit and/or the design of a novel  circuit. Figure M1 shows one possible way to outline the modelling procedure.  Generally, we begin with a mathematical model that captures the dynamics of the  biological circuit in question. For instance, this biological circuit could be a gene  regulatory network; we could model such a system by a graph structure capturing the pattern of connections between the genes in the network. The topology of  connection is only of limited used with regards to a complete understanding such  a system; thus, we could impose a dynamical system over this graphical model.  Now, the nature of this dynamical model would depend on the task at a hand; depending on our need we might be looking at a deterministic model or a stochastic  model. Once we have a model, it is imperative to decide upon the values for the  associated parameters. For an explanatory task, we would estimate them from experimental data; and for circuit design these values would be driven by biological  constraints and/or a sweeping of the parameter space to identify values for which  the system exhibits the desired behavior.  Realizing the significance of the assistance modelling offers in circuit design, in  this section we provide details for the various in-silico experiments conducted  by our team. The basic circuit that team iGem IIT Delhi has worked with is the quorum sensing version of the Amplified Negative Feedback Oscillator.  This particular configuration has been implemented in as has been discussed  earlier. We start with the original model of the Danino oscillator; discuss it's implications and suggest modifications to this model so as to incorporate the idea  of reconfigurability.
Danino Oscillator: Synchronized quorum of Gene oscillatory Networks
For the sake of completeness, the model for Danino is replicated here as well from  equations 1.1 - 1.4. This is a deterministic model for intracellular concentrations  of LuxI(I), AiiA(A), internal AHL(Hi) and external AHL(He)
In equations 1.1 and 1.2
describes the delayed production of corresponding proteins, it depends on the past concentration of the internal AHL, Hτ(t) = Hi(t-τ). Description for the various parameters in these equations can be found in. The two parameters of immediate concern to us are the prefactor [1-(d/d0)4] and the flow rate μ. The prefactor[1-(d/d0)4] describes slowing down of protein synthesis at high cell density d due to lower nutrient supply and high waste concentration; thus, to ensure proper functioning we maintained a constant cell density of 0.6 (od 600). A sufficient flow rate is necessary to ensure diffusion of AHL to ensure oscillations in the system. If we look at equation 1.1 qualitatively, it tells us that AiiA is activated by the past concentration of internal AHL in the cell; thus, capturing the causal nature of AiiA’s activation by the AHL produced by LuxI. Similarly, equation 1.2 shows this process for LuxI, capturing that fact LuxI is a self activator here. For internal AHL in 1.3, we can see that it is being activated by LuxI as well as it is positively affected by the difference with external AHL concentration. In equation 1.4 the last term is quite interesting. This is the term that captures the synchronized nature of the oscillators; the movement of AHL across the cell membranes allows the cells to communicate with their neighbors regarding the state of oscillations.To study the quantitative solutions of the Danino model1, we look at two broad scenarios: 1. First, we analyze the bulk scenario, where we ignore the diffusion term (D1=0) 2. Second, we include the diffusion term and observe the cells as synchronization takes place.
