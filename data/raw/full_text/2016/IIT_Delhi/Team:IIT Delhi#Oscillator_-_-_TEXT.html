Motivation
Remember ’Mystique’ from the X-men franchise? Albeit prone to a little villainy,  she is that amazing character with the blue skin; and possessed the uncanny ability  to effortlessly transform into anyone at will. Quite an intriguing capability; her  cells had the potency to reconfigure into any individual of choice as per necessity.  Now, that may be a far fetched dream, but we can take a lesson or two from  Mystique’s biological gifts. For instance, reconfigurable electronic circuits may not  be far out of reach [? ];these systems would be the ideal multitaskers, switching  between functionalities as the need arises. Synthetic Biology also seems to be  vying for a place in this domain; from reconfigurable logic gate systems [2, 4] to  systems with switchable dynamical behavior [1, 2, 6].  On an abstract level, the idea of reconfigurablity resonates with Team iGem IIT  Delhi. Works like [1, 6] that propose a novel synthetic circuit, which can act both  as an oscillator and a toggle switch have been a major influence on our work. The projet is divided into two parts; and at the heart of it all lies a ”Sychnronized  Quorum of Genetic Clocks” [3]. First, we develop a reconfigurable circuit that  can switch between an oscillator and a toggle switch. We realize this circuit  using the oscillator of [3]. In order to achieve a toggle switch behavior, we add  the lambda repressor; which is susceptible to thermal denaturation. Thus, at  temperatures of around 30 deg. celsius the system acts as a toggle switch, since  the lambda repressor is constitutively produced and represses AiiA. However, as  the temperature is raised to 37 deg. celsius, the lambda repressor undergoes  thermal denaturation and thus the system starts acting an oscillator. The second  part ofour project focuses on modifying the oscillator in [3] such that we are able  to tune the frequency response. The frequency tuning is under the control of  light. Addition of an optogenetic component to the system affords us control over  the frequency by simpling shining light on the system; thus, we call the second  system ”Highly Optogenetically Tuned Frequency Modulator” or as we like to  call it, HOT-FM. We desgined the purported optogenetic system using the Ccas-  Ccar system. Simulations support the hypothesis for frequency modulation. The  Biological realization for this part of our project is still under work. Throughout  the wiki, we explain the different stages of implementation for the two systems.  We begin with a very brief review of the work done of oscillators, followed by a  detailed description of the synchronized oscillators of [3]. An increasingly crucial  component of synthetic circuit design is the use of computational resources. In  this regard, first we replicate the results of [3]; and we build on this computational  model to study the effects of our proposed modifiations. Simulations support our  hypotheses regarding the two systems that we have proposed.
Oscillator Circuits
The aim of synthetic biology is to design and synthesize biological networks that  perform desired funtions in a predictable manner. A significant chunk of workin synthetic biology has focused on the construction of two important type of  networks: switches and oscillators. Synthetic biology is at the intersection of  biology, engineering and computational mathematics. Consequently, there are two  distinct aspects to the design, analysis and implementation of a synthetic circuit:  in-silico and in-vivo validation. Under the in-silico paradigm, we forego the specific  implementational details, rather we are focused on the abstract mathematical  model and the dynamical behavior such a model allows. While for in-vivo analysis,  we work on identyfing the specific biological components that can be used to  implement the identified topology for the synthetic network. Here, we look at  both these aspects for the Danino Oscillator [4].
Figure (number intro1) shows some topologies which are known to show oscillatory  behavior [8]:
Goodwin Oscillator
Repressilator
Amplified negative feedback oscillator
Fussenegger Oscillator
We’ll give a very brief overview of the Goodwin and the Amplified negative feed- back oscillators . The Danino Oscillator is essentially a quorum sensing version of the Amplified negative feedback oscillator.
Goodwin Oscillator - This was the first synthetic genetic oscillator to be  studied. It consists of a single gene with negative autoregulation. Models  suggest that oscillations occur in the goodwin oscillator if repression is mod- elled by a nonlinear Hill function with a high cooperativity coefficient [3].  Further, this oscillator has been shown to have a robust time period.
Amplified negative feedback oscillator Leaving aside the biological im- plementation, this abstract topology is the one used in the Danino Oscillator.Under this architecture, the activator gene A activates it’s own repressor gene  B. In the Daanino oscillator there is a latent phase when both the activator  and repressor accumulate, thus allowing large amplitudes to be achived for  this configuration.The qualitative behavior of this oscillator is discussed in  the modelling section using the mathematical model suggested in [4]. One  crucial benefit that the Danino oscillator has over this topology is the prop- erty of quorum sensing; the AHL molecule can diffuse across the cell mem- brane and be exchange with neighbouring cells. This offers a mechanism to  synchronize the oscillators.
Project
The main focus of team iGem IIT Delhi has been ’reconfigurability’. Keeping this  in mind, we have divided the project into two modules; each centred around the  idea of reconfigurability. Module I is a tunable oscillator where we can change the  frequency of oscillation. Our proposed design focuses on using an optogentic mod- ule to achieve control over frequency. While Module I would switch the frequency  of oscillation between two non-zero values, Module II implements a toggle switch  over an oscillator. Thus, the idea is to be able to kill the oscillations in a manner  that the concentration of one of the components stays at a low value, while that  for another component stably stays high.
Module I - HOTFM
We call this module ’Highly Optimized tunable Frequency Modulator (HOTFM)’.  The idea is to modify the Danino Oscillator so that we can tune the frequency of os- cillations. Further, we wish to use optogenetics to control this tuning. Oscillators  can be used as clock references, and thus, controlling the frequency of oscillation  would offer certain advantages. For instance, increasing the frequency might allow  faster execution of a process and vice versa. In this regard, one possible medicalapplication could be time-controlled drug delivery. If a drug is known to function  optimally if delivered at distinct regular intervals, an oscillator handling the de- livery of the drug would be an attractive option. Further, if under circumstances  quie stark from the ordinary, the rate delivery needs to be increased (decreased),  our approach could be a viable option.
We require two additions to an oscillator to realize HOTFM. A mechanism to  modulate the frequency of oscillation and an optogenetic module to act as a switch  for this mechanism.
Frequency Modulation
The Danino oscillator has a latency period where both the activator (LuxI) and  the repressor (AiiA) grow in concentration. One possible way to reduce the time  period of oscillations would be to reduce this latency period. For the Danino os- cillator, it is known that the time period and amplitude have a linear relationship  [4]; thus, we could, in principle, reduce the amplitude to reduce the latency pe- riod and increase the frequency of oscillation. We propose to do this by adding  negative autoregulation on AiiA. This transforms the amplified negative feedback  oscillator into a smolen oscillator [8]. There are additional benefits of adding  negative autoregulaation on AiiA; this makes the oscillator robust to parameter  variability [8]. If there is a sudden variation in AiiA’s concentration the negative  auto-regulation would automatically bring the concentration back down. Thus, we  expect HOTFM to have lesser peak to peak variability compared to the original  Danino oscillator. In-silico simulations confirm our intuition about HOTFM (refer  to the modelling section for a detailed analysis).
Optogenetic Module
In order to have a tunable frequency modulator, we need to have a switch that  controls the negative auto-regulaation (self-repression) on AiiA. To achieve this  end, we use optogentics as a flexible and easy mechanism. The Self-repression pathway is put under the control of lambda repressor; and this lambda repressor  controlled by the Ccas-Ccar system, which is an optogenetic module. So, whenever  the oscillator is required to change it’s frequency of operation, we can, in principle,  shine light on the cells and the self-repression pathway (mediated by the lambda  repressor) would be activated.
