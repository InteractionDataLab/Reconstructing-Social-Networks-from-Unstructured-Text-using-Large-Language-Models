Collaboration
This year, we collaborate with three different universities on different perspectives of our project. They are the Rice University , with whom we collaborated last year, the Indian Institute of Technology Madras , and the National University of Singapore . The exchange of ideas enables us to get inspired, and allow us to understand that collaboration is, in fact, a fruitful learning experience on either end.
