Insights from Tristable Switch
After analysing the problems that iGEM teams usually encounter, we probe into our Tristable Switch to see how it can be applied to solve these existing problems. In the end, we think of some ways to assist the other iGEM teams. Although only some of them could be carried out at the time being, Tristable Switch could at least provide us with some ideas to resolve part of the current difficulties.
