Achievements - Parts submitted
We acutely realise that our project idea is possible only with the efforts and contribution of iGEM predecessors, our team inherits and upholds such spirit by devising new biological parts and devices in hopes of sustaining the iGEM community in the future.
Below is the table documenting the parts we submitted to the iGEM registry this year:
