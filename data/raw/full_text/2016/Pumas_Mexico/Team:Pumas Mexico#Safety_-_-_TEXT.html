Safety
C.vulgaris is a common organism that does not impose safety risks for lab or for the environment. In the project our safety was focused on the cross contamination of the algae and how would it dwell if it were to be accidentally released to the environment.
First we need to understand that our algae is designed to work on bioreactors and controlled situations on closed ponds, this way we can control the algae and how it grows, in the eventuality of it escaping it has the following details that made the biosafety part of the system:
>The algae has the stress metabolism active all the time, while this would allow it to survive in bad conditions under normal conditions it will be at a severe disadvantage towards its non-modified brethren.
>If the algae were to be released under stressful conditions, since the lipids are released to the environment it  will not have them to protect itself and will die.
Our project will benefit farmers and people who are entering the industry of biofuels using Jatropha by being a cheapest and more efficient alternative to it, in this way we can benefit poorer parts of the country while helping reduce the environmental impact of airplanes.
