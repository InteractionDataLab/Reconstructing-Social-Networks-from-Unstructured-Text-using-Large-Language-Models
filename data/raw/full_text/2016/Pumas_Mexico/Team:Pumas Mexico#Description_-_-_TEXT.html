The synthetic Biology team, Pumas Synbio, seeks to develop an organism capable of carrying out useful functions for industry and society. According to airports and auxiliary services of Mexico (ASA), only in the in 2011, the aviation industry issued 675 million tons of CO2, which represents 2% of total global CO2 emissions.  In Mexico we consume 3.200 million of liters of aviation fuel annually, while we share the same conditions for innovation than other countries in terms of fuel. Pumas Synbio aims to improve the process of obtaining Pumas Synbio aims to improve the process of obtaining biofuel aircraft to improve the way competing in the market, we talk about investment of resources to find the  efficientest chain production and increased income-producing states, and help to curb climate change.
Our proposal
The Syner-G project, seeks to improve a third generation biofuel that exceeding the current proposals. With the modification of beta oxidation of the green algae Chlorella vulgaris, from silencing genes related to Acyl-CoA synthetase, by siRNA and lipid optimization with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genes.
Chlorella vulgaris
It is a green algae, phototroph oxygen, of spherical cellsof 5-10 micrometres.Has a chloroplast parietal in shape of cup, with or whitouth a pyrenoid in the part axial of the chloroplast with two or five granules of starch.
Their cells Wall is thin. Multiplied by two to eight autospores. It is a kind planctik, soil and piphyte of wide distribution in Mexico. Its biochemical composition in percentages are as floows: total nitrogen 7.13,crude protein: 44.56; true protein: 32.25; carbohydrates: 16.0; crude fiber: 8.20; lipids: 0.29; ashes: 8.90 and nucleic acids: 5.69. In the current field of the production of buofuels from biomass of algae or cyanobateria, this is used as an indicator of the potential production of biofuel(Chisti, 208). Extraction of lipids of these microorganisms processes require large quantitaties of biomass cultivation fot its subsequent drying and treatment with solvents to obtain the celular lipid content, this entails an enormous energy expediture amounting to 70 or 80% f the total energy equired for the production of biofuel (Molina Grima et. al.,2003). The search for a means of obtainig of lipids that does not involve the sacrifice of biomass would ideal advance in the production of biofuels based on algae or microalgae.
