Students
Alejandro Guzmán Vendrell
He is a Biology student at the UNAM, and is one the team leaders  as such he was responsible for the communication with the advisors, getting the lab, money, sponsors, getting stressed in behalf of the team, and worked on the biohackademy collaboration, outreach talks  and on modeling. Alejandro got interested in the Undergraduate Biology program because of the complexity and beauty of life, coupled with that “it is the career where he could find the integration of all what he likes”; he would like to develop biotechnology and to take his startup to the future.  He is one the students who where part of the team last year and uses that experience on this year problems.
Ilia Xrysw Hernandez Mejia
Xrysw, is  the head of the Human Practices area of the project and student career of Chemical pharmaceutichal and biology of the UNAM, career that she joined because she was always very curious and loved reading about science. She worked on the entrepenour part of the project and  wetlab .  In the future, Xrysw wants to engage in genomic medicine, or pharmacogenomics studies on the prevention of genetic diseases or linked to genes, as some cases of predisposition to cancer, as she has always liked being able to help people. She was fundamental in the cleantech contest.  She is one the students who where part of the team last year and uses that experience on this year problems.
Carlos Andres  Gil Gomez
He is a Biology student at the UNAM. Andrés was interested in biomathematics as it was a way to work on both his favourinte areas and to have further understanding in the living world. He is one the students who where part of the team last year, where he also worked in the modeling section
Laura Elena Figueroa Bravo
Laura is the head of the PR and financing  area of the project and is a student of the Physician Undergraduate program at the UNAM; she was fundamental for the money for the project and manage to get many outreach talks.
Franklin Cruz Villegas
Bright and enthusiast biologist. Great and hard working guy. He invested a whole amount of his time in the lab during the summer. He worked passionately and was fundamental on the experimental part of the project at Wetlab.
Enrique Zeferino Barrera Vargas
He is an undergraduate student in Mathematics. He is an active student in the Drylab section and proposed many valuable ideas for the modelling part of the project. Enrique loves learning about nonlinear dynamics and enjoys thinking on very diverse things such as complexity, synthetic biology, solutions to waste production and more. His favourite authors are Alexander von Humboldt, Göethe and Hemingway. He says one of the things he can do best is to contemplate. "I love to see the complex relationship between living systems and its environment. For instance, it is marvellous to just imagine all the interactions between the living organisms inside old forests/rainforests, etc. or to wonder about the transition from organic chemical compounds into life".
Zabdiel Díaz Morales
Zabdiel is a biologist who worked on the cleantech challenge and some of the outreach talks he also colaborated with Evelio with diffusion of science
Carolina Guadalupe Cruz Núñez
Head of wetlab, she coordinated everyone on the lab and worked on the caractherization of the biobricks.
Alán Fernando Muñoz González
He is a fifth semester student from the Undergraduate Program in Genomic Sciences, he is interested in the population dynamics studied with an integrative focus, such as systems or synthetic biology. He worked on the Flux Balance Analysis modeling part of the project.
Anastasia Hernandez-Koutoucheva
Genomic science student, she worked on the FBA modeling part of the project.
Rodrigo Hernández Velázquez
Genomic science student, he worked on the FBA modeling part of the project.
Ilse Citlalli Alonso-Anaya
Biologist, she worked on the outreach talks.
Evelyn Alejandra Polaco Mendoza
Biologist she worked on the wetlab part of the project.
Itzel Paola Benítez Trejo
Biolgist, she worked on the modeling part of the project and gave talks at Cetiem and cleantech.
Evelio Joaquin Espinoza
My name is Evelio, I am a happy, Valuable and loving man. Mechatronics Engineering student in the Faculty of Engineering, divugacion generate scientific content, I take photographs during the team events, advertising for different events, Support in the generating video content and , exhibitor at Campus Party Mex Guadalajara..
Alejandro Alarcon del Carmen
Biologist he was the designer of the biobricks and worked on wetlab.
Advisors
M in B. Jose Antonio Alonso Pavon.
Human practices advisor, he worked on the development of the workshops for the university, on how to give the outreach talks and general help for the team.
Dr  Jose Utrilla Carreri
The interests of Jose are centered around complex and adaptative systems, especially in biology.  He is the modeling advisor of the FBA section of the  project.
Dr. José Eduardo Rodríguez Bustamante
Eduardo is very interested in different areas such as: synthetic biology, molecular biology, evolution,  biotechnology and chemistry. He is interested in applying biotechnology knowledge to solve different kind of problems.. He is the main advisor in the wetlab part of the project.
Dr. Roberto Arreguín Espinosa de los Monteros
Our main advisor and PI; Head of the Lab in the Chemistry institute, he offered insight for the wetlab area, space in the lab and helped solve almost every problem we encountered like the sending  and customs.
Pablo Padilla Longoría
Secondary  PI of the project he worked in the modeling part of it and helping get the funds when needed.
