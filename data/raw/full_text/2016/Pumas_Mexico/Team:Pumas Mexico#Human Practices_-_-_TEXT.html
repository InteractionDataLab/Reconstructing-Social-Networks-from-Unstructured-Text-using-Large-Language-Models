Human Practices
Description
When we do science, we often forget that science should serve society, to make positive impact and change. Human practices, is the way we help and approach as scientists to the society in which we lived. Is to test our models, protocols and knowledge in a real plane to solve real problems, the contribution that we as scientists to the rest of society, the way we found to bridge the gap and allow everyone to experience the thrill we feel to do science.
Our human practices is divided in 3 sections  > Education and engagement: were we worked on getting science to more people as well as making an impact in university students not limited to scientific areas.  > Integrated Human practices: were we talked to people in the industry about the economic potential and its current problems of the technology  > Entrepreneurship: were we looked into the possibility of making a company from the project and its implications.
