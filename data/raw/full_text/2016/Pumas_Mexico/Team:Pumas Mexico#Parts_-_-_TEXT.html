Las biopartes que se presentan a continuación fueron diseñadas a partir de genes en otras organismos. En este caso, homólogos de Saccharomyces cerevisiae en Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, para su aplicación en Chlorella vulgaris, y de C. reinhardtii a C. vulgaris.
Offer an alternative of viable energy for our current social dynamics was our main ímpetus to carry out our first objective: desig a strain of C. vulgaris with the ability to secrete lipid to the medium and that it has a superior in comparison to storage of wild type (WT).
DGTT1 Is a gene present in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, is responsible for the production of lipids. De facto, Chlorella vulgaris already has a regulation of production, however, with this is obtained a great improvement with regard to quality. The lipid profile is mediated by the medium wich is.
To avoid the formation of bodies that sweeps the replication of DNA in Chlorella use a vector, plasmid pCAMBIA 1301, constituting, with a strong promoter.In this case, incerted in the GUS section, after enzymatic digestión of both (GUS of pCAMBIA and puCIDT-Kan GATA:6 in DGTT1). Synthesis of our part of interest was conducted by the Integrated DNA Technologies.
