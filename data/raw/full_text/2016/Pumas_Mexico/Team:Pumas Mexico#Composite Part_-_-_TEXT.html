Exocytosis.  There are three genes for lipid activation to β-oxidación reported in Saccharomyces cerevisiae wich, to be silenced, show a phenotype of lipid secretion. There also are homologous genes in C. reinhardtii.To silence the by iRNA it is possible and likely thhat we get similar results.
Retrived on: synthesis by IDT Technologies. Desired phenotype: lipid excretion in the middle. Without sacrificing biomass.
