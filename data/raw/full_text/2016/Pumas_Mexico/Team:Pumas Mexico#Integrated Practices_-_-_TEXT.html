When designing this kind of projects is important to take into consideration the economic part and how do our project can affect the people in the areas we are trying to implement it. The current projects in Morelos for the production of biofuels are based on Jatropha for it.
Thinking on how to solve this issue we talked to people at the IER (Institute of renewable energy for its initials in Spanish), they helped us analyses the economic situation and how we could approach this.
Jatropha produces good amount of lipids but it has a slow growth rate
If there’s an alternative, if would needed to be capable of surviving tropical weather.
The lipids extraction can only be done once on the seed.
The country has a plan to move airplane fuel to biofuels in the coming years.
With this information we design the project taking into account the limitations that Jatropha has so we had in mind that it has to be a fast growing organism that could be utilized several times.  After this we continue to develop the project eventually participating at Cleantech Challenge 2016 at Mexico city where we were given feedback on the economy and entrepreneur part of the project.
We needed to align to the government programs for biofuels
Our target market would be to develop alternatives and not the biofuel in itself.
We needed to focus on make it grow in a reliable manner.
This feedback helped us do the final touches and worked on the modifications on the biobrick it was at this step that we designed the biobrick for exociting the lipids to the medium. This all helped us get selected to present the project at “ Vive Conciencia” as a young innovators project and CNER ( National congress of renewable energy) we hope to continue extending the outreach of the project.   In conclusion during the project we continue to extend and get feedback from people who are directly involved in the developments of renewable energy and we are grateful for their help.
