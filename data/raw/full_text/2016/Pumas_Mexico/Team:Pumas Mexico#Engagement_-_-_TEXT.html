As part of our Human practices area we give several talks and work on the outreach of Synbio to people we achieve this by radio interviews, presentations, Science fairs, and talks around the country. We try to raise awarness about the biofuels issue, how we need to look for local alternatives and for teaching younger generations
Cetiem talk.
Place:Mexico City, Mexico.
Name: Young day UNAM edition
Expositor: Benitez Trejo Itzel Paola
We were invited by CETIEM ( Student chapter for technology innovation and entrepreneurship for its initials in Spanish) to give a talk in "Young day UNAM edition" to people of engineering majors about synthetic biology and their applications in the industry.
This events helps us teach how entrepreneurship and synthetic biology are an  option for young biologists and how is and interdisciplinary field.

Pumas synbio y taller de bio sintetica.
Our biggest accomplishment is making the transition from the official “ Workshop in Synthetic biology” to “Pumas Synbio”. Pumas synbio is the name of the student research group that focuses on solving problems in our country by using synthetic biology, we are now officially recognized by the university and we have expanded from the Faculty of Science to the Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine and Center for Genomic Science. We have already participated in Cleantech challenge and we are working on vive conciencia y CNER project.   This group is working with the grad students of biohackademy  trying to expand to public knowledge what we do and working with more official institutions.
Our total outreach was of aroun 3700 persons reached directly and posible many more by repetitions of the programs and the youtube videos of the talks.
