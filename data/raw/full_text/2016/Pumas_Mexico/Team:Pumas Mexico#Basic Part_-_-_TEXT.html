DGTT1 is a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii gen, of this in charge of the síntesis of fatty acids. The about expression of this in the seaweed Scenedesmus obliquus reported more lipid production. Being both phylogenetically near Chlorella vulgaris, we hope similar results.
Obtained:Location molecular and by weight in the do, too PCR in C. reinhardtii, and extraction. Synthetis by IDT Technologies.
Extensión: 996bp in pUCIDT-Kan: GATA 6.
Obtained phenotype: on production and storage lipid, at rates of 14C to 18C, mainly myristic acid (14:1), palmitic acid (16:1),stearic (18:0), oleic (18:1),linoleic (18:2).
Mobile phase for CF used: ether petroleum: ethyl ether: acetic acid 80:10:10
Vector used: pCAMBIA 1301, promoter strong 35S, stablising.
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
