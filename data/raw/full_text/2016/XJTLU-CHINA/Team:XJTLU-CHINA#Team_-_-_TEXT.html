Wenbo Xu (James): Wenbo is a rising senior at Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University and also the team leader of XJTLU iGem. His ‘American’ bio-clock in China makes it possible that all members enjoyed the next-day sun rise together. Wenbo participated in the first XJTLU’s iGem team and this year manages all the stuff in XJTLU-CHINA. Biology should be his lifelong persuing and he is so attracted by biological sciences.
Yuwei Han:Yuwei Han is a rising senior in Year 4, Department of Biological Sciences. She is the vice team leader in the team. During her journey at XJTLU-CHINA, she is coordinating all the experiments with the team leader. Besides, she is famous for her hardworking engagement and strict with the experimental procedures. Members in XJTLU-CHINA consider her as a nice sister. She always help us with the obstacles in the process.
Hongyu Duan (Amber): Hongyu is a rising sophomore in XJTLU. She is responsible for the intron laboratory construction and retrohoming of target. She is attracted by detective novels and movies. Journey Under the Midnight Sun is her favorite. A shinny and sensitive heart is covered by her quiet appearance. Hongyu is also a carefully observer either for people or work.
Kaitong Lu (Carol): Kaitong is a rising junior in XJTLU and manages the team charges and other money matters. She also participates in some lab work and data collected. Kaitong loves simple styles, not only for clothing, but also for furniture and housing design. She fancies the series of Lost in Space and Paulo Coelho’s novel: The Alchemist.
Mulei Gong (Marie): Mulei is a rising sophomore in XJTLU and co-leads the experiment this year, especially in the construction of functional factors in Qβ replicase. She is a fan of Nirvana, so of grunge rock.
Yuntao Wang (Wendy): Yuntao is a rising junior in XJTLU. She works in poster design for presentation and the experimental construction of Qβ replicase in XJTLU-CHINA. She is good at cooking and could prepare good soup for members. Her shinny character always relaxed the whole team. Yuntao is talkative and therefore actively communicate with instructors for experiment details.
Mengjia Li: Mengjia is a sophomore in XJTLU and studies Genetics since 2016. He is responsible for the function test in BL21 of subunits in Qβ replicase. He is a crazy collector of earphone and a fan of electric device like ps4. Mengjia compares different brands of earphone through from the aspects of sound quality and comfort degree. Stax 007 is his recommendation.
Zhiming Mao: Zhiming is a rising junior in Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool university. He almost manages all human practice and video producing. Zhiming is good at communicating and negotiating, which has greatly promoted the connection of XJTLU-CHINA with the university and the public. The plot and design of the video is also from him.
Qing Zhang: Qing is a rising junior in XJTLU. She was in charge of the solubility detection of Qβ replicase and leaded the iGEM interlab experiment as well as the collaboration with ZJU. She is a strict doer and explorer with a high aim. Her reputation is fairly good among her friends due to her generosity and sense of humour, and it is under her encouraged two important members from fields other than pure biology to this magic journey of iGEM.
Xiaoyu Li: Xiaoyu is a year 2 undergraduate in Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. She mainly focuses on the experimental construction of Qβ replicase and treats every detail in experiment carefully. Her self-portrait on blackboard promoted other members’ interests in self-drawing and created a zone of paintings. She tries to discover more about nature especially plants and looks forward to observing creatures in a jungle one day.
Fengshuo Liu (Jack): Fengshuo is a rising sophomore in XJTLU and participates the genome splicing and reconstitution of Qβ. He is always tracking the update of US TV series like revenge and prison break. Green day is the band he admires. Fengshuo is also a fan of Harry Potter movie series. He likes to create some funny gestures or actions to amuse teammates and sometimes make it a video.
ChengYang Nie(Young）： Young, a rising senior at Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, is a low-key and elegant laboratory technician in XJTLU igem. Just as his name say, Young is also an energetic adolescent with talented in all sport field.  Ripped figure, splendid basketball skills, Young is the one surrounded by girl's scream and admiration. However, that’s not his lifestyle in the laboratory. Steady, deliberate, he just like a gentleman when handling and designing the experiment contents. He is young, a young but matured man support the XJTLU-china toward a superior team.
Kaifu Wang: Handsome mathematician from applied mathematics. Thanks to his participation we repeated the intron algorithm and established a model to predict the performance of MUTA INVIVO project. We biologist are impressed by his intelligence and willingness to explore new things. Let us expect what he will bring to future biostatistics or other multidisplinary studies.
Yuming Xu: Yuming is a rising junior in XJTLU and co-leads the experiments in this year project mainly in intron construction practical group. He is also responsible for poster design and many visual works. Relatively strict living routine sometimes leads to the imagination of a picture that he is playing tai chi under a tree with a  group of retired Chinese old gentleman. Yuming has a sense of responsibility. He is really hardworking and has everything well-planned.
Ziheng Chen (Calvin): Ziheng is a rising sophomore and predominantly responsible for the design of intron part in 2016 XJTLU-CHINA. Sherlock Holms acted by Benedict Cumberbatch is his favorite and that is the reason why he tried to have the similar curly haircut of this version of Sherlock. Since September 2016 he started studying biochemistry in University of Liverpool.
Kunqi Chen:  Kunqi is  a Year 4 student in Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University, and surely, majors in Biology which is his favorite. He thinks biology now is the most popular field in the world. It is just like a bridge, leading people to explore the secret of life. IGEM is a competition that allows students to better practice their current biology knowledge. He strongly believes that he will see numerous innovative thoughts.
Tiancheng Li:Tiancheng is a rising sophomore in XJTLU. He participates in team wiki and desion plasmid recombination. The former school debate team member has been immerseed in learning Geerman and Japanese. He enjoys online communication with foreign peers, sometimes argument though.
Lei Zhang: Lei Zhang is a Year 3 student in department of biological sciences. During the journey of XJTLU-CHINA, he made posters for propaganda as well as participating the video demonstration.
Yizhe Mao: Yizhe is a rising sophomore in XJTLU and is a co-leader of genome group. He also participates the design of genome reconstitution. Exercising-loving Yizhe fancies to build muscle to obtain good muscle shape and body line.
