BBa-K1906003
Function
One of Qβphage proteins, a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase named Qβreplicase has an ability to induce substitution of base pairing with no significant preference at a high mutation rate (~7 × 10-2). The two parts as cofactors Tu and Ts (BBa-K1906001, BBa-K1906002) could improve the expression of Qβreplicase (BBa-K1906003) to generate our RNA random mutation pool

BBa-K1906007
Function
Since the mutant product of Qβreplicase is in RNA form which is not stable enough so the combination of intron a (BBa-k1906004), intron b (BBa-k1906005) as well as the selective marker Kanamycin gene could store the mutant product as cDNA by reverse transcription. Once maturase (BBa-k1906000) is induced, antibiotic resistance gene Kanamycin in intron A-Kan- Intron B (BBa-k1906007 ) will be inserted into the mutant DNA for selection purpose to achieve the goal of DNA mutagenesis library construction
