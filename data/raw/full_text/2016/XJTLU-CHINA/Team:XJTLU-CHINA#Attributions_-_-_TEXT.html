Overview
Members in XJTLU-CHINA are responsible for the project in 2016 and handled almost all issues. However, there are also great supports from the surroundings. We started our brainstorming about this year project in November, 2015 and started the wet experiments in March, 2016. The lab experiment lasted for about 7 months. We would like to say many thanks to instructors, sponsors, practical consultants (including students), the public in human practice, etc.
Attribution
Management: Wenbo Xu
Wenbo Xu almost managed all the events in XJTLU-CHINA and participated in both dry and wet experiments.
Overall idea: Wenbo Xu, Ziheng Chen
The idea of Qβ replicase was firstly put forward by Wenbo Xu and the idea of intron by Ziheng Chen. Other members developed their ideas and had brainstorming together to design the specific outline of this project in the later processing.
Wet Experiments
Almost all members in XJTLU-CHINA were involved in wet experiments. The main members in each group are listed below and they had also been involved in dry experiment to some degree for the specific design of each part.
1. Ts Tu Rep construction: Mulei Gong, Xiaoyu Li, Yuntao Wang, Zhiming Mao, Kunqi Chen
2. Intron construction: Yuming Xu, Hongyu Duan, Kaitong Lu, Fengshuo Liu, Ziheng Chen, Zhiming Mao
3. Protein detection and characterization: Qing Zhang, Mengjia Li
4. Qβ Genome deletion and reconstitution: Yizhe Mao, Chengyang Nie, Fengshuo Liu
5. Retrohoming: Fengshuo Liu, Hongyu Duan, Kaitong Lu, Yizhe Mao
6. Improvement of last year project: Hongyu Duan, Kaitong Lu, Chengyang Nie
Mathematical modeling
Kaifu Wang established all mathematical models for the whole project and he helped process the data of DNA sequences and understand the mathematical part in references.

Human Practice
Undergraduate student research and novel Biology
All members participated in public speeches.
Presenter: Zhiming Mao Mulei Gong, Wenbo Xu
Invited Professor: Dr. Jia Meng & Dr. Tatsuhiko Kadowaki
2016 International STEM Festival
Almost all members participated in STEM Festival as narrators to introduce our 2016 project and the previous project to the public.
Public speech presenters: Yuntao Wang, Mulei Gong, Hongyu Duan
Road show in Shanghai Technology Museum:
Zhiming Mao, Kaitong Lu, Fengshuo Liu, Ziheng Chen
Collaboration
Liaison With other iGEM teams seeking for collaboration: Yuntao Wang, Qing Zhang, Zhiming Mao
·With ZJU iGEM team: Qing Zhang
Qing Zhang helped ZJU to improve their hardware and characterize a part. She worked with infoCo club of XJTLU to construct a programmable red-green lighting system suitable for 96-well plate, which enables them to remotely control the on-off setting and light intensity for each sample space. This extendable design may accelerate their experiment and it shows a connection between how arduino (electric engineering) can help to characterize bioengineering process.
·Interlab: Qing Zhang, Mengjia Li
Qing Zhang and Mengjia Li measured the relative fluorescence of GFP of 5 devices, which is aimed to characterize the measurement of fluorescence.
·STEM Festival: Wenbo Xu
In STEM Festival, XJTLU-CHINA was collaborated with ZJU and NYU-Shanghai and did a group presentation towards the public.
· Demonstration in Shanghai Technology Museum: Zhiming Mao
XJTLU-CHINA was collaborated with SJTU-Shanghai, Tongji University, NYU-Shanghai for a road show.
