Activity 1: Road show at Shanghai Science and Technology Museum
What we identified and investigated:
Since the aim of our project is to build a mutagenesis library, we considered current application and the public ideas on mutation and gene modification.  Firstly, we investigated the trials and related products in recent years online. For example, space radiation is used to obtain mutants of green pepper. Wheat is treated with gene editing to stop the common wheat diseases. Furthermore, an online investigation was conducted to search for data and information about the general opinion of the public in China towards mutation and gene modified product. From a research of Zhang &Wang (2013), we found the general attitudes of the public towards gene modified food. We managed valuable information and generate a pie chart to briefly state the findings.
It shows that 44.90% of the public have a vague perception about mutation and gene modification and over 40% think gene modified food is harmful for health (Zhang &Wang，2013).
How we addressed:
According to the results we investigated, we try to address bioethics and safety about mutation and gene modification to the public to relief their worries on gene modified food. On April 16th, 2016, we planned a part in the Road show at Shanghai Science and Technology Museum to deliver related basic knowledge to promote the perception of the public. Four iGEM teams (SJTU-Shanghai, Tongji University, NYU-Shanghai and XJTLU-CHINA) made collaboration.
During the whole day, about 800 teenagers from 5 years old to 16 years old visited to the museum. We prepared lectures related to mutation and health based on teenagers’ level to broad their horizons and clear the public perception related to mutation and bioethics, such as genetically modified food. Extensive applications for mutagenesis library are elucidated on our team poster in Chinese, which attract public attention. Some people commented on the feasibility and practical application of mutagenesis library.
This road show is also aiming at educating teenagers with scientific knowledge in biological sciences and inspiring them to explore the areas of interest. We used software to illustrate the complicated cell mechanisms under VR, which attracted most students’ attention and even the concentration of their parents and relatives. They are all highly prized our team to inspire their children with vivid illustration.

Activity 2: Campus talk at Guangya Middle School in Guangzhou
Since some of our team members are student lectures at Guangya High school in Guangzhou, we take this opportunity to contact the leaders the school. They prepared popular science lectures related to iGEM and novel Biology topics in genetics.
We kindly introduced the history and philosophy of iGEM competition and encouraged students in Guangya to actively explore the scientific areas of their interest. Furthermore, we are expected to provide technical help for their high school iGEM team construction. Hot biological topics are prepared by the student lecturers aiming at facilitating high school learning in guiding students to think deeply and jump outside the textbooks.
Activity 3: Seminar: Undergraduate student research and novel Biology
This public speech is held on campus by XJTLU-CHINA team on April 6th, 2016. Students from all different departments are encouraged to participate in this seminar. The aim for this public speech is spreading the idea that undergraduates should actively participate in research activities so that they can effectively integrate their theory into real life, thereby facilitating their academic performance and scientific career in the future.
