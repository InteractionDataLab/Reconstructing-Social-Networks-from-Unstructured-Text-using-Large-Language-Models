Human Practice
Overview
The human practice part of XJTLU-CHINA team for 2016 is significantly highlighted throughout the whole process of running the project. Based on the theme of “Youth Research” this year, lots of activities such as seminars, public speeches and road show are held aiming at providing public education not only for university students, but also for children, teenagers, and old people. The content of those public activities is adapted from the project and effectively integrated with knowledge which different ages of people are thirsty for gaining. Through those activities, the public perception is promoted as well with our scientific knowledge and detailed examples. Furthermore, our human practice activities aim at a deeper understanding about how biologists help the achievement of long-term sustainability with the knowledge equipped with, how scientists deal with the ethics issues, how biologists can facilitate policy-making and how intellectual products can be transferred into real life.
Summary
