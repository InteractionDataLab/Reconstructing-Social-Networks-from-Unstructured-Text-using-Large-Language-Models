In particular, throughout this festival, hundreds of students and their parents are attracted to see the latest science and technology innovations. 
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-6"><P style="line-height:1.8;">
With the demonstration of our team project, we set up an interaction activity with the surrounding guests in order to discuss the ethic issues about genetically modified food. It attracted a lot of people putting forward the idea on the given topic: Your attitude and potential consequences if genetically modified animal leave the lab and into practical use. During the interaction, we help the public to develop a more holistic and deeper insight towards the ethic issues in genetically modified food.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-6"><P style="line-height:1.8;">
During the festival, we delivered a specific lecture on the practical application of mutagenesis and how biological sciences can provide help for achieving sustainability of the whole society. The Q&amp;A session had effectively cleared public perception.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-6"><P style="line-height:1.8;">
Our demonstration of the team project for 2016 attracted much attention from business leaders, young adults and even the senior citizens. The picture below showed the curiosity to our project. They told us that they care more about how our mutagenesis can help cure severe diseases and wonder how the project could be applied into practical use. This type of information inspired us to work hard and consider more about how our project can help the society to achieve sustainability.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-12"><P style="line-height:1.8;">
On the last day, head of the Elementary Education Division at the Jiangsu provincial Department of Education as well as leaders from Ministry of Education, P.R. China accompanied by president of our university spoke highly of XJTLU-CHINA team members on independently conducting undergraduate student research project. We had shared ideas with them on public policy issues for current scientific subjects as well as the promotion of STEM subjects in China from undergraduate perspective.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-12"><P style="line-height:1.8;">
Also, we are also involved in the discussion of cultivating studentsâ€™ scientific and rational thinking, especially focusing on equipping young people with the knowledge and skills to solve tough problems with practical experiences.

In September, student research groups at Xiâ€™an Jiaotong-Liverpool University get together to share the experiences and detailed program to other research groups throughout the whole process of conducting research program. Other student groups come from electronic and engineering as well as computer programs.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-12"><P style="line-height:1.8;">
We introduced synthetic biology to them by highlighting the multi-disciplinary requirements and the relative relationship with the association with knowledge in electronic or engineering. 
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-12"><P style="line-height:1.8;">
Jo Johnson MP, The United Kingdom Minister for Universities and Science, showed great interest and commented our project on fascinating innovation and inspiration.

whether your project can help with the treatment of disease?</SPAN></P><P class="MsoNormal"><SPAN lang="EN-US"><O:P>Â </O:P></SPAN></P><P class="MsoNormal"><SPAN lang="EN-US">2. Residents in Shanghai: I wonder whether
genetically modified organisms can pose negative impact on human life. Although
it can facilitate the food production in China, what are the consequences for people
if they had this type of food for decades?</SPAN></P><P class="MsoNormal"><SPAN lang="EN-US"><O:P>Â </O:P></SPAN></P><P class="MsoNormal"><SPAN lang="EN-US">3. From children at the age of 6: I was
heard that the cell was negligible, but I could not imagine how complicated is
the cell mechanism under my observation of VR. It is not easy for a little cell
to conduct such sophisticated process!! It is amazing!!</SPAN></P><P class="MsoNormal"><SPAN lang="EN-US"><O:P>Â </O:P></SPAN></P><P class="MsoNormal"><SPAN lang="EN-US">4. From parents: Thank you so much for
inspiring our children with so fascinating tools, actually it is quite nice
with vivid animation. I hope the teachers can use more active teaching tools

During the activity, we have mentioned about the mutation breeding during the development of spaceflight. Through the UV light in space, the mutation can be randomly generated. Some of the benefit mutations are applied into agriculture to solve the food problem. The random mutation is similar to our mutagenesis project. Some local citizens showed worried to the mutations that may pose negative consequences in our daily life. They tend to be afraid of the super-bacteria that will be difficult to be treated. Stimulated by this comment, we paid much attention in particular doing the experiments. After working with the bacteria, we auto-cleaved them instead of simply flowing into water tank to avoid the mutation generated. When working in the lab, harsh rules were made including always wearing gloves in the lab to avoid being infected by bacteria accidentally.</SPAN></P><P class="MsoNormal"><SPAN lang="EN-US"><O:P>Â </O:P></SPAN></P><P class="MsoNormal"><SPAN lang="EN-US">Furthermore, since they are worried about the super-bacteria, we educate the public with scientific knowledge to clear their misunderstanding. The high frequency of antibiotic resistance has currently become an enormous threat to human being. The increasing number of multi-drug resistance bacteria has made current antibiotics hard to cope with because of the abuse of antibiotics by individual and hospitals. Thus, we strongly emphasize the significance of antibiotics use in daily life properly. In our project, we desire to generate more benefit mutations through our in vivo process. To modify our project, we can identify more possible mutations that can fight against the antibiotic resistance problem. </SPAN></P><P class="MsoNormal"><SPAN lang="EN-US"><O:P>Â </O:P></SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class="text-center"><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:XJTLU-CHINA/HP/overview" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Overview</A><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:XJTLU-CHINA/HP/Silver" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Silver</A><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:XJTLU-CHINA/Engagement" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Engagement</A></DIV></IPG></DIV><DIV class="footer-above"><DIV class="container-fluid"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="footer-col col-4"><H3>Location</H3><P style="text-align: center;">Rm 363, Science Building
