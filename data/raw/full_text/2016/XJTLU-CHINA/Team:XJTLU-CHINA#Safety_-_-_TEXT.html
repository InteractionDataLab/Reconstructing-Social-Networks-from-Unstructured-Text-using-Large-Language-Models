General principles
1. Food and drink are forbidden taking into laboratory.
2. Team members must wear experiment coat in the laboratory.
3. Lab gloves should be worn all the times. Gloves should be changed and dumped at regular intervals. It is forbidden to touch others with gloves on. Wash hands when leave the lab.
4. Personal stuff which are unrelated to experiment, such as school bags and cell phones, are forbidden in the lab.
5. We should observe the timing for conducting experiment. Team members are not allowed to play along in the lab.
Experiment part
Overview:
1. Each group should prepare their own reagents and put them onto their specified bench.
2. Reagents and equipments should be placed back to their original position. Electronic devices should be cut off, pipette should be at the maximum range. At the end of each experiment, bench should be cleaned and electricity should be cut off. It is not permitted to alter the arrangement of devices and equipments in the lab, no foreign devices should be brought into the lab.
3. Liquid waste should not be dumped into the trough directly. Bleaching is required for disposal.
4. X-ray room should be closed at all times, team member should close the door when they leave.
5. When finishing operation on clean bench, the ventilation should be turned off and the UV should be turned on for 20 minutes to avoid contamination. Similar rules applies when team member start to work in clean bench.
6. Autoclave the lab waste regularly.
7. Gloves should only be used when conducting experiments. Do not touch door knob.
Experiment details
Experiments related with DNA/RNA:
1. Follow the protocol.
2. Place regents and devices at their original positions.
3. Prepare protocol beforehand, take notes when necessary and save the results after experiments.  Experiments related with proteins:
1. It is only permitted to make SDS gel in fume hood. Gloves should be dumped after gel making and running. Wash hands after each experiments.
2. SDS gel should be preserved as soon as destaining finished. Gel should be discarded.
3. SDS running buffer should be changed once every three days. If not used frequently, running buffer should be discarded after single use.
