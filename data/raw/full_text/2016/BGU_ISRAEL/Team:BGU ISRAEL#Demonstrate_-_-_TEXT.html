Demonstrate
A big part our goals was to demonstrate our working product- a PET degrading biofuel cell. Our working method was to                             divide the system into small, attainable parts that we can demonstrate separately, before we build the final product.                             For example, we demonstrated a working biofuel cell with P. putida, and a working dialysis bag with E. coli.                              These tests prove that each of the parts can separately work in conditions similar to those existing in a working fuel cell.                             More info in our Results page.
