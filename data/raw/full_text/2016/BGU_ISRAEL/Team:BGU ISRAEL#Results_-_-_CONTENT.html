                            The bacterium <I>Rhodococcus ruber</I><I>R. ruber</I>, known to utilize polyethylene (PE) as a carbon source, was grown in various liquid growth
                            media with and without amino-acids and containing PE or PET pellets for a period of 30 days. 
                        </P><P>
                            For control we used a SM liquid growth medium with glucose, glucose and amino-acids and a SM medium with no carbon
                            source (for detailed instructions on preparation of the media see <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:BGU_ISRAEL/Protocols">Protocols</A> ).
                        </P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-6"><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><P><B>Figure 1:</B><I>R. ruber</I> grown on SM liquid media with various carbon sources for a period of 30 days. Positive control is glucose and negative control is SM medium with no carbon source.

                            As expected the results show that growth on glucose media was substantially faster and yielded high O.D<SUB>600</SUB> measurements throughout the experiment. 
                            We have observed similar results when the bacterium was grown on media containing amino acids (AA), suggesting the bacteria can utilize the AA as a carbon source. 
                            The media containing plastic as the sole carbon source (PET, PE), reached higher O.D<SUB>600</SUB> values from that of a medium with no carbon source (SM medium) but lower O.D<SUB>600</SUB> than on glucose media or plastic enriched with AA media. 
                            All samples have shown a steep rise in the absorbance on the first few hours of the experiment. We can assume that these results are due to the trace of rich medium that was left from the starter that was used prior to the begining of the experiment. 
                            This might also explain the increase in O.D<SUB>600</SUB> values in the SM medium. Lack of values of certain samples is due to contaminations or broken equipment.
                        </P><P>
                            After 30 days we ceased measuring O.D<SUB>600</SUB> values, but continued monitoring our samples for bacterial growth. 
                            Samples were left to incubate unopened for 3 months to test for the formation of biofilms.
                        </P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-6"><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><P><B>Figure 2:</B><I>R. ruber</I> biofilm formation on a PE pellet.

                            As seen in the picture (fig. 2), after 3 months <I>R. ruber</I> developed a biofilm surrounding the pellet (in this case â€“ PE). The orange color is a unique property of <I>R. ruber</I>. 
                            We have witnessed similar results with PET pellets, suggesting <I>R. ruber</I> can also utilize PET as a sole carbon source.
                        </P><P>
                            We took samples from both PET and PE media (with pellets) and examined them with a Phase-contrast microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM):

                            First, we could see that <I>R. ruber</I> was present in its planktonic form in the media.
                        </P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-6"><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><P><B>Figure 4:</B> An image taken with a Phase-contrast microscope from SM media with PET after incubation with <I>R. ruber</I>. In the center we notice a large vacuole we bacteria inside.
                                        </P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV></DIV><P>
                            After further examining the images we noticed the formation of vacuoles close to aggregates of bacteria. 
                            We assumed the vacuoles are made up of Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) that was secreted by the bacteria into the media. 
                            We speculated that in this case the EPS is used for the absorption of the PET micro particles and allows the accumulation of secreted enzymes. 
                            The enzymes are used to catalyze the initial cleavage of the polymer and allow absorption of nutrients (Laspidou et al 2002). 
                            These images suggest a mechanism to improve degradation by increasing the extracellular degrading enzyme concentrations.
                        </P><P>
                            More samples from the same experiment were analyzed using SEM:
                        </P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-6"><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><P><B>Figure 5:</B> A scanning electron microscope image of an untreated PE pellet in a X1000 magnification.

                            As seen from the images above, there is a substantial difference between the surfaces textures. The control's (fig. 5) surface is rough while the treated one is smoother (fig. 6). 
                            It can be explained by the ability of bacteria, i.e. its enzymes, to degrade exposed and less dense polymers with more ease, smoothening the outer layer.
                        </P><P>
                            We performed SEM on the PET samples in order to examine if the same effect on the polymer's surface is observed:

                            Contrary to our expectations, the untreated PET surface is smooth while the treated sampleâ€™s surface seemed to have gone through degradation (fig. 8).  
                        </P><P>
                            Furthermore, we have come to notice the appearance of crystalline rods near bacteria aggregation sites. 
                            That can be explained by the preferential degradation of the amorphous material exposing the better defined (higher crystallinity) material that goes through a slower degradation (Shah et al 2008).

                            Our results suggest that <I>R. ruber</I> is able to degrade PET, having presented substantial changes before and after incubation with PET. It should be mentioned that it is not yet established that <I>R. ruber</I> is able to utilize PET as a carbon source. 
                            In order to verify this possibility, more tests are needed. 
                            After identifying <I>R. ruber</I>'s mechanisms of plastic degradation such as secretion of polymer degrading enzymes and forming vacuoles from EPS to increase the extracellular enzyme concentration, 
                            we decided to concentrate our efforts on improving a PET degrading enzyme.

                            One method to assess the activity of our designed mutants was using the pNP-butyrate (pNP-B) degradation assay
                            (see <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:BGU_ISRAEL/Protocols">Protocols</A>).
                            
                            We ran the tests on all 5 variants of the LC-Cutinase protein with different concentrations of the substrate:

                                        </P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV></DIV><P>
                            As seen from these results, all of our variants, including the codon-optimized Cutinase, have shown increased pNP-B degradation activity compared to the W.T. LC-Cutinase in all concentrations tested. 
                            We can also see that the highest activity is displayed by the codon-optimized(CO) Cutinase, followed by the F4 mutant.
                        </P><P>
                            These test were preformed by incubating the substrate with a supernatant from LC-Cutinase expressing bacteria and not taking into consideration the different expression levels of each variant. 
                            Even though later tests with <I>R. ruber</I> show that the concentration of enzyme is an important part in efficiency of degradation, 
                            we still decided to run these tests again, with equal enzyme concentrations on our 2 fastest variants - CO and F4:
                        </P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-6"><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><P><B>Figure 15:</B> pNP-Butyrate degradation activity of 3 LC-Cutinase variants - CO, F4 and the W.T., at a substrate concentration of 125Î¼M. 
                                            Enzyme concentration is 0.11mg/ml.
                                        </P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV></DIV><P>
                            Again, we can see that the CO and F4 variants have higher activity in regards to pNP-B degradation than the W.T. Cutinase. The CO Cutinase is once again with the highest activity, suggesting that expression levels are not a major determinant in its pNP-B degradation activity.
                        </P><P>
                            To calculate the amount of improvement in activity of our variants we constructed a Lineweaver-burk plot using the following protocol: 
                            A pNP-Butyrate stock were prepared with 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and pNP-Butyrate in concentrations ranging from 50 Î¼M to 2000 Î¼M.
                            Enzymatic activity was determined at 26.8<SUP>o</SUP>C:

                            As seen from the results, the K<SUB>m</SUB> values of our variants compared to the W.T. is of the same magnitude, so we conclude that there is no significant change in affinity.

                            That being said, more experiments are required in order to confirm our hypothesis and determine the proper concentrations of the protocatechuic acid and characterize the mechanisms with which it mediates <I>P. putida</I>'s electron transfer. 
                            It should be mentioned that protocatechuic acid polymerizes in the presence of amine groups, a reaction that could interfere with the electron transfer, hence other more potent mediators will be explored including the operation of the biofuel cell without mediators, since <I>P. putida</I> are reported to produce their endogenous electron transfer mediators.

We have demonstrated that creating a biofilm on a graphite anode can be easily done, making this part of our system applicable.

                            In this experiment we grew <I>E. coli</I> strain BL-21 transformed with the pACYC vector containing the LC-Cutinase W.T. gene and induced with IPTG in a liquid M9 medium with PET.

                            As seen from the results, our <I>E. coli</I> was able to grow with only PET as a sole carbon source, suggesting it utilized PET's degradation product, ethylene glycol, as a carbon source.

                            Moreover, we see that <I>E. coli</I> remained viable throughout the experiment, verifying our hypothesis that it can grow inside a dialysis bag, and suggesting that our symbiotic design using a dialysis bag is plausible.

We consider that result as an important step and a proof-of-concept of our final goal.

                        Our two dialysis bag experiments clearly demonstrate the plausibility of our designs.

                        Detection of TPA in plates containing PET and E. coli using fluorescence
                    </DIV><P>
After seeing bacterial growth on our PET plates, we wanted to combine our protocols of PET utilization and to detect the presence of TPA in our plates. If our speculation was correct, the LC-Cutinase was supposed to be expressed from the <I>E. coli</I>, degrade the PET, and the bacterium could consume ethylene glycol from the degradation products. If that was the case, TPA would be present in the plate. 
</P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-10"><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><P>
                                        Figure 44: PET plates (prepared as previously described in the PET Utilization experiment (<A href=" https://2016.igem.org/Team:BGU_ISRAEL/Experiments">Experiments Page</A>), after colony growth, were exposed to UV light (as described in the Terephthalic acid detection assay (<A href=" https://2016.igem.org/Team:BGU_ISRAEL/Experiments">Experiments Page</A>)), then tested in a fluorescence gel imager to detect TPA presence by excitation in 314nm end detecting emission at 426nm. For control, TPA presence was detected in plates containing <I>E. coli</I> transformed with an empty vector plasmid (the same vector used for expression of LC-Cutinase), and no bacteria at all.

                        As shown, plates containing <I>E. coli</I> expressing LC-Cutinase showed higher emission levels, which indicates of higher presence of TPA in the plates in question. The control plates still have certain background emission, but it can be due to background emission from the polystyrene plates. This experiment, although it cannot quantify the degradation efficiency, is another indication of the existence and activity of the LC-Cutinase enzyme, and the ability of <I>E. coli</I> expressing our LC-Cutinase to utilize its degradation product- ethylene glycole.
