Plastic Art
Many artists and organizations use plastic in their art works to get across a very important lesson to the public about plastic pollution. The art helps relay a strong visual message to the viewer that at times, is more intense than an article in a newspaper.
Making the project and learning about the colossal impact of plastic pollution we made it one of our goals to raise awareness and expend recycling habits of our community. We saw in the art we found a wonderful way to convey this important massage. Here we present some artists and organizations from around the world; we thought created beautiful pieces that we think had very strong statements and will make you think twice before buying your next plastic bottle.
Washed Ashore organization
"Angela Haseltine Pozzi is an artist and educator who founded the Washed Ashore Project. The project is aimed at educating people about the huge amount of plastic debris that’s found within our ocean and waterways. SeaWorld Parks uses the sculptures of sea life such as fishes and turtles, made out of recycled marine debris, to create public awareness".

"In my current body of work, Plastic Classics, Old Masters are given a contemporary twist. I use anything of the right size, shape or colour: toys, shells, buttons, beads, jewellery, curtain hooks, springs etc. No colour is added - everything is used exactly 'as found'."
"Impressionist paintings are the perfect inspiration for my work. It needs to be viewed in two ways (as in Impressionism) - from a distance to make sense of the whole image, and close up to identify the materials used (the brush strokes). Similarly, the 3D nature of Van Gogh's thickly applied paint which he squirted straight from the tube, lends itself to interpretation using found materials. Van Gogh painted 17 different versions of his Sunflowers in varying compositions and with different coloured backgrounds. I have made several versions of Sunflowers and Mona Lisa - each one is unique, according to the materials found at the time."
