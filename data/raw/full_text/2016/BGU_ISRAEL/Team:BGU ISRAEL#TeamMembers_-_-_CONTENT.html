                            Participating in competition is a unique opportunity to get experienced in the field of synthetic biology. We learn how to plan experiments, collaborate and manage a laboratory. In addition to the lab work, we get to work with students from other departments and learn of other projects from around the world.

                            I've joined the project after I learned about the projects subject and its agenda. I come from a Moshav in the north of Israel. As a child I used to hike and spend a lot of time outdoors with my family and friends. Preserving and keeping the environment clean always been a great part of my life, so I was happy to participate and contribute to such an important subject.

                            I joined iGEM because the project sounds very interesting. It's a good opportunity for me to be exposed to the research field and to be a part of a unique experience. Personally, I care about keeping our environment clean and that is why I get a lot of satisfaction from our work. For me, the most exciting thing is that we inspire to achieve something innovative which will have a wide influence.
