                                &quot;Synthetic biology is a relatively new science with tremendous potential to change how we view and know the life science, 
                                but like many developing technologies, it has provoked ethical concerns from the scientific community and the public and

                                Synthetic biology promises significant advances in areas such as biofuels, specialty chemicals, agriculture, and medicine 
                                but also poses some potential risks.

                                Many concerns might stem from the field of synthetic biology. For example modifying an organism for medical purposes or 
                                environmental care is still a debate in our culture. The lack of knowledge and the complexity of this field arise many 
                                questions and concerns among the general public. Furthermore, similar concerns are expressed by scientists who specialized
                                in other fields of research. We thought that as we modify organisms in our lab enabling them to preform new functions, 
                                we should learn our limitations and the complexities are involved in synthetic biology. We aimed to study the bioethical
                                issues that may arise from our project to  ensure no harm can be caused by our product.

                                Shimon Glick describes several ethical issues related to Synthetic Biology from a 
                                Jewish aspect in a paper he published a few years ago:” Synthetic Biology: A Jewish View” (1):
                                Ethics raises many issues and controversy in science. According to Judaism philosophy, man is
                                considered as a collaborator with God; his motives to research are pure.
                                His goal is to improve mankind and its surroundings. However, there are many risks
                                when we deal with science, like deliberate abuse or dangerous miscalculations.

                                During the summer, we met several experts from the bioethics field, who gave us general new ethical insights that might be
                                relevant for our project.
                            </P><P>
                                First, we met with Prof. Ute Deichmann, an expert in History and Philosophy of Science. Prof.  Deichmann gave us an initial
                                overview of bioethical issues in research. We learned that ethics issues are reviewed and examined as soon as a new 
                                scientific method or technology is being developed and becoming useful for different applications. Furthermore, ethic 
                                issues might arise during the research process. For instance,  researchers confronts ethical questions regarding integrity,
                                objectivity and authenticity during the research process. Therefore, researchers should ask  themselves what the motivation
                                that fuels my research is. The researcher's desire for knowledge and achievements should not overcome the obligation for 
                                ethical values such as dignity, integrity and candor. Thus, we learned that ethical issues need to be considered in many 
                                aspects.  
                            </P><P>
                                Second, we learned that our designed product is encountered with a relativity new term called genetically modified organism 
                                (GMO). GMO is an organism whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques. GMO became wildly 
                                used to produce genetically modified crops, medications, medical devices and nano-technology. Furthermore, GMOs is widely 
                                used in many aspects of scientific research. 
                            </P><P>
                                We also learned that there are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, when a marked difference can be 
                                found between the United states that favor for GMO products while Europe union is basically against. 
                            </P><P>
                                Third, we asked ourselves what is the potentially harmful consequences that may emerge when implementing new technology.
                                Does a genetically modified organism can have a negatively effects on the environment or on human being? Such concerns 
                                are also considered a biosafety matter as creating a GMO is accompanied with lots of uncertainties regarding its future
                                effects on the environment. Apart from biosafety, synthetic biology raises also biosecurity concerns, as products of 
                                synthetic biology could potentially be used for malicious intentions.  
                            </P><P class="medHeader">The regulation of bioethical issue in Israel</P><P>
                                In recent years, effective biosafety laws and regulations have been adapted by several countries to prevent terrorists and 
                                other hostile powers from obtaining dangerous biological agents, technologies, or information that would allow them to 
                                develop and manufacture biological weapons. 
                            </P><P>
                                In 2008, the Israeli parliament (&quot;Kenesset&quot;) decided to tighten biosecurity measures and legislated the regulation of 
                                research into biological disease agents law, which provides a legislative framework to conduct research involved biological 
                                disease agents. The law calls for the establishment of a council to regulate and monitor research on select infectious 
                                disease agents. It also prescribes institutional committees with defined responsibilities and identifies means of control,
                                including penalties and liabilities.

                                Until the beginning of the 50's there were no clear guide lines or standards for ethical behavior in conducting a research.
                                World-wide governments, including the federal regime in the USA, had a minor role in regulating and enforcing ethical 
                                standards.

                                enforce these regulations, government instructed the establishment of the Institutional Review Board (IRB). IRB is an

                                Learning about bioethical issues, we continued to explore the history of bioethics. We met with Prof. Shimon Glick from the 
                                Faculty of Health Sciences (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er-Sheva, Israel), an expert in the field of Jewish
                                medical ethics. In the meeting Prof. Glick thought us about Jewish views of bioethics. We discussed ethical issues 
                                concerning new technology, including synthetic biology.
                            </P><P>
                                In his paper, &quot;Synthetic Biology: A Jewish View”, Prof. Glick describes the Jewish approach towards scientific progress as
                                well rounded and aware to the problems it presents: &quot;Judaism traditionally looks favorably on man as a co-creator with God
                                and encourages research for the benefit of humankind. Thus, the Jewish tradition would haves a positive attitude towards
                                the current goals of synthetic biology. But, in the Jewish tradition man is also charged with stewardship over nature and 
                                is admonished to preserve and nurture, not just to exploit and destroy&quot;.
                            </P><P>
                                The Book of Genesis indicates that God gave people control over the animals and earth, while Genesis emphasizes that the 
                                role of people is to maintain and take care of the world. The Talmud which is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism, teaches 
                                a basic ethical principle in Jewish law, the 'Bal Tashchit' (&quot;do not destroy&quot;) commend. The commend orders men not to waste
                                or destroy our earth, the commend is invoked only for destruction that is deemed unnecessary. Many hold the view that 
                                pollution is an insult to the creation of the world, and it is considered immoral to put commercial concerns before care 
                                for God's creation. However, humans are regarded as having a special place in the created order, and their well-being is 
                                paramount. Humans are not seen as just another part of the ecosystem, so moral decisions about environmental issues have 
                                to take account of their well-being.

                                After meeting Prof. Glick, we were eager to learn more about how Judaism deals ethical issues regarding scientific research
                                and progress. We found a quote from Rabi Moshe Ben Maimon (Maimonidas), a philosopher, scientist, polymath and one of the 
                                most important adjudicators in the Jewish religion that lived in the Middle Ages :&quot;If men possessed wisdom, which stands 
                                in the same relation to the form of man as the sight to the eye, they would not cause any injury to themselves or to others,
                                for the knowledge of the truth removes hatred and quarrels, and prevents mutual injuries&quot;. Maimonidas didn’t see any future
                                harm in the search for wisdom as he derived that the search and common goal cancels any violent notion.
                            </P><P>
                                Judaism holds an ambivalent opinion regarding genetic engineering and technologic innovation. It indicates the need of
                                finding a balance between the human's wellbeing and preserving the creation. These principals are much alike some aspects 
                                in the modern approach towards bioethics.

                                Familiarizing with the GMO concept, we discovered that there is a discrepancy between the way the public perceive bioethics

                                Our final goal as the BGU iGEM team is to create an operating biofuel cell, which will break down polyethylene
                                terephthalate (PET) using <I>E. coli</I> and <I>P. putida</I>. We chose to work with these bacteria, as they 
                                are known chassis organisms, are easy to manipulate, and are risk group 1 (<I>P. Putida</I> - DSMZ) – they
                                do not cause diseases in human. Moreover, we use the <I>P. putida</I> KT2440 strain, which is the first 
                                Gram-negative soil bacterium to be certified as a safety strain by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee 
                                (Federal Register, 1982(3)) and is the preferred host for cloning and gene expression for Gram-negative soil 
                                bacteria (Nelson, K. E., et al. 2002(4)).

                                With the safety of the environment in mind, we designed a metabolic cascade to degrade the toxic intermediates
                                in the PET degradation pathway, to non-toxic compounds that can be used by the bacterium for energy in the TCA cycle.
                                This way, the degradation process does not release any pollutants or toxins to the environment other than the 
                                carbon dioxide and water bacteria produce in their own metabolic processes.
                            </P><P>
                                In order to ensure the safety of our product, we integrated into our design the self-destruct mechanism developed
                                by the <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:BGU_Israel"> 2013 Ben Gurion University iGEM team</A>. With this mechanism, not only the expression of our genes will be dependent
                                on an IPTG inducer, but it will also force our <I>E. coli</I> to be fully dependent on an unnatural amino acid (UAA).
                                Without supplying it to the bacteria medium, or in case of release to the environment (which will only happen by
                                accident since we do not intend to release our bacteria), our <I>E. coli</I> bacteria will not survive. Our second bacterium,
                                <I>P. putida</I>, which is design to consume TPA (one of the PET degradation products), would not be able to consume
                                PET as it is dependent on LC-Cutinase (the enzyme which breaks the initial bond in the PET polymer into TPA and EG),
                                since LC-Cutinase is expressed and secreted from <I>E. coli</I>. Therefore, the genetic modification done on this 
                                bacterium will be useless, since it is responsible for degrading TPA, which is a commodity chemical that usually 
                                does not exist abundantly in nature.
