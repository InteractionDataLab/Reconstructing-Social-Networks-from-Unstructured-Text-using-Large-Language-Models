Come And Meet Our University
Ben Gurion University of the Negev
Ben-Gurion University was established in 1969 as the University of the Negev with the aim of promoting the development of the Negev desert that comprises more than sixty percent of Israel. The University was later renamed after Israel's founder and first prime minister David Ben-Gurion, who believed that the future of the country lay in this region.
Be'er-Sheva
The largest city in the Negev desert of southern Israel. Often referred to as the "Capital of the Negev", it is the center of the fourth most populous metropolitan area in Israel. Beersheba is located on the northern edge of the Negev desert 115 kilometres (71 mi) south-east of Tel Aviv and 120 kilometres (75 mi) south-west of Jerusalem. The city is located on the main route from the center and north of the country to Eilat in the far south. The Beersheba Valley has been populated for thousands of years, as it has available water, which flows from the Hebron hills in the winter and is stored underground in vast quantities

Collaborations
Collaboration between scientists is essential in order to excel and to achieve fast progress. In our day and age people from other countries, and even continents, can communicate easily and exchange information in various ways. We feel privileged to have met and communicated with people from so many different countries and cultures. We got help from teams who assisted us in improving our system offering to incorporate their own projects and previous knowledge. In exchange we ventured to help them, using our own experience and resources available to us.
