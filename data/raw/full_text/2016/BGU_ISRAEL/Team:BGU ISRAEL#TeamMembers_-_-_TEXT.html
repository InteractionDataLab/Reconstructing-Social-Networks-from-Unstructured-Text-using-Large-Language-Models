Tomer Shary
Study:
In the 3rd year of my Bachelor's Degree in Biology-Psychology.
Position:
Head of the group, Research team.
Why Did You Join The Project?
Participating in competition is a unique opportunity to get experienced in the field of synthetic biology. We learn how to plan experiments, collaborate and manage a laboratory. In addition to the lab work, we get to work with students from other departments and learn of other projects from around the world.

Why Did You Join The Project?
I joined the iGEM team because of my wide curiosity about anything related to science, and the idea of independently run a research seemed magical to me.                             The project topic, biodegradation of plastic is a great cause to follow.
Inbar Bariah
Study:
In the 3rd year of my Bachelor’s Degree in life sciences.
Position
Research team.
Why Did You Join The Project?
I joined the team to acquire additional lab experience and, more specifically, to experience the interpersonal dynamics of a large laboratory. Also, I saw this as an opportunity to broaden my horizon with a new field of research.
