Be'er Sheva
History
Be'er-Sheva has an extensive history, covering over 6,000 years. The modern city was built by immigrants who came to                             Israel from some 70 countries throughout the world, and to this day it is populated by a broad variety of different                             communities. Be'er-Sheva was first declared a city in 1906, and in 1977 it was granted its municipal status.
Metropolitan Be'er-Sheva - A Quality Metropolis
Be'er-Sheva, the Negev's capital, is the fourth metropolis in Israel.                             Be'er-Sheva has about 214,500 residents and provides services to approximately 600,000 residents living in the metropolitan                             area as a whole.  City residents benefit from a thriving and developing university, with roughly 30,000 students, including                             8,000 undergraduates in the fields of engineering, the highest rate of students study engineering in the entire country.
Be'er-Sheva is the seventh city in Israel in terms of population size, but is the second largest in terms of its territory.                             The area of the city is 117.5 square kilometers (~45.5 square miles), 2.25 times the area of the city of Tel Aviv. In fact,                             Be'er-Sheva and the Negev make up about 60% the total land area of entire State of Israel, and are therefore the most                             significant resource in terms of available land reserves, making the city a potential gold mine for investors and entrepreneurs.
Demographics
The age distribution of the city's population is unique, and the city is considered one of the youngest cities in Israel,                              with ~50% of the residents under the age of 40.  On the other end of the curve, 13.7% of city residents are aged 65+.
Education
The total number of K-12 students in Be'er-Sheva is about 32,000, of whom over half - ~16,974 are elementary school students.                             The City of Be'er-Sheva is home to approximately 300 kindergartens, 51 elementary schools and 31 junior and senior high                              schools.  In recent years, the city has made a significant leap forward in the percentage of its students who are eligible                             to take full matriculation exams, while at the same time, maintaining one of the lowest urban dropout rates in the country.
