Education
We took part in various events both in and out campus to spread the knowledge of synthetic biology and iGEM to the public.
Komaba Festival
2015 Nov. 21st ,22nd ,23rd
Location: UTokyo, Komaba campus
Komaba Festival: a school festival at UTokyo
We introduced synthetic biology as an academic field, and explained our research result and the prize we received from last year.
Result: We were able to introduce synthetic biology and iGEM to a number of people who did not know about them. 130,000 visitors came to the festival.

May Festival
2016 May. 14th, 15th
Location: UTokyo, Hongo Campus
May Festival: a school festival at UTokyo
We introduced synthetic biology as an academic field, and explained our research result and the prize we received from last year, like we did in Komaba Festival. In addition, we invited iGEM teams from other universities in Japan (Kyoto,Gifu,KAIT_Japan,Tokyo-NoKoGen, Tokyo_Tech), and presented respectively.
Result: We were able to introduce synthetic biology and iGEM to a number of people who did not know about them. 145,000 visitors came to the festival.

Techno Edge
2016 Aug. 9th, 10th
Location: UTokyo, Hongo Campus
Techno Edge: an event for primary and senior school students to experience engineering.
We explained the basic concept of genetic engineering, using simple examples to make every participant, including primary school students, understand.
What’s more, we explained BioBrick, iGEM, and our activities as well.
Result: We were able to deepen participants’ understanding of genetics and molecular biology, since most of them were unfamiliar with heredity, DNA or E. Coli, let alone genetic engineering.
The Genetic Society of Japan
2016 Sep. 7th ,8th ,9th ,10th
Location: Department of International Relations, Nihon University, Mishima Campus
The Genetic Society of Japan: an academic meeting which researchers from all over Japan gather to, presenting and listening to each other’s research.
Several presenting topics were set in the Genetic Society of Japan, among which we presented as the iGEM team of Japan. Participants include Gifu,Nagahama,Kyoto,Tokyo_Tech,UT-Tokyo,HokkaidoU, and professors from Hokkaido University and Tokyo Institute of Technology.
We made a 15 minutes presentation aboout our projec at Symposium Workshop WS10-6 (18:15-18:30)
Symposium Workshop title:Genetics, Synthetic Biology and iGEM（International Genetically Engineered Machine）Activities by Undergraduate Students
We also listened to words from not only iGEM related people, but also professors in genetics, and received valuable advices.WS10-6 18:15-18:30
