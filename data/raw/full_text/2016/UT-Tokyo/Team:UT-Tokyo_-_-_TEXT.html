Gene expression changes after each cell division
Our project would be able to exhibit, in E. coli,               that despite carrying the same genetic information, different phenotypes can               be expressed across generations.               Moreover, this technology could potentially be applied in field to carry out               certain tasks automatically without the need of external input eg. to make               engineered cells automatically carry programmed cell death after a certain number               of divisions.
