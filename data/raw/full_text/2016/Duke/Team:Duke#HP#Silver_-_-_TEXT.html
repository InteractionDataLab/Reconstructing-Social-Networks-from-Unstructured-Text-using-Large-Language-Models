To brainstorm a path for the marketability of Duke IGEM’s invention, we looked at the potential patentability of genetically-modified bacteria capable of Taxol production. This is an essential step, because the ability to earn future funding and to incentivize a pharmaceutical manufacturer to use our product in the market is contingent upon the company having an exclusive right to the invention. Having argued a case for why IGEM’s invention is patentable, the next step should be to work with Duke University patent attorneys to get the application and licensing processes started.
