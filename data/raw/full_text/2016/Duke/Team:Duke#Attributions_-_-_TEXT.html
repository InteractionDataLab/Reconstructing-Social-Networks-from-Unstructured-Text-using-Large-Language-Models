Organizations
The research was funded by generous grants through the Duke University Bass Connections program and Lord Foundation of North Carolina. Additional funding and materials was provided by New England Biolabs, GenScript, IDT, and BioBasic. We would also like to acknowledge material and equipment contributions from both the Buchler Lab and the Lynch Lab of Duke University.
Faculty and Advisors
We would like to especially thank the following people for their commitment to the Duke iGEM team.
Mike Lynch
We would also like to acknowledge the assistance of Michael Lynch from the Duke Biomedical Engineering Department for administrative duties, protocol development, project planning, and troubleshooting.
Adim Moreb
Finally, we would like to recognize the efforts of Eirik Adim Moreb of the Lynch Lab for for troubleshooting protocols, ordering of supplies, and experimental design.
Maggie Mbugua
(not pictured) We would also like to thank Maggie Mbugua of the Duke Biomedical Engineering Department for demonstrating use of lab equipment including the sonication device, the spectrophotometer, and the plate reader.
Anthony Ciesla
(not pictured) We would also like to thank Anthony "TJ" Ciesla, a graduate of the Duke Biomedical Engineering Department and former iGEM president, for laying out the design groundwork and preliminary research for creating the necessary sequences for the taxol enzyme pathway.
Our entire project’s conceptualization and realization was completed entirely by our undergrad team. Our graduate student and faculty mentors helped us by teaching how to use advanced lab equipment and perform advanced techniques. When our undergrad team ran into problems, mentors were available to help guide us through troubleshooting but any new direction taken was entirely of the students’ creation.
