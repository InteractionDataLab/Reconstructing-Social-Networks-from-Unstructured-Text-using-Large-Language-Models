This is his second year as a member of iGEM. Outside of lab, Adam enjoys watching films, anime, and reading novels. His favorite film is Oldboy (the original Korean film, not the disgrace that was the American remake), his favorite anime is Neon Genesis Evangelion and his favorite novel is Notes from the Underground.  He is most interested in metabolic engineering and CRISPR mediated recombineering and hopes to pursue a Ph.D in bioengineering.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD align="center"><H4>Ben Hoover</H4><P>Ben is a senior at Duke University majoring in Biomedical Engineering and pursuing a focus in electrophysiology and medical instrumentation. As a second year returner to iGEM, he has matured slightly from the middle school excitement and naiveté of last year’s research experience (see bio in Duke iGEM 2015). In addition to working with the iGEM team on campus, he works as an RA and TA for ECE and enjoys teaching and interacting with children. It was only a year ago since he was one, after all.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD align="center"><H4>Emma Miles</H4><P>Emma is a junior at Duke University majoring in Biomedical Engineering. This is her first year on the iGEM team. In addition to working on the team, she also works as a laboratory assistant for the Tobin Zebrafish Lab. Future plans include focusing in tissue engineering with special regard to women's issues. She is from Pueblo, Colorado and loves to visit with family, friends, and her pet. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD align="center"><H4>Jaydeep Sambangi</H4><P>Jaydeep is a junior at Duke University majoring in Biomedical Engineering, specialty currently undecided. This is his first year as a member of an iGEM team, and he is largely interested in learning various laboratory techniques. He plans to study medicine and one day pair that study with an engineering degree to do something exciting and new. Jaydeep enjoys reading and watching TV in his spare time and above all likes to learn new things.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD align="center"><H4>Nisakorn Valysasevi</H4><P>Nisakorn is a senior at Duke University majoring in Biology and Computer Science from Bangkok, Thailand. This is her first year on the iGEM team and is passionate about computational biology (protein modelling and genetics) and the biomedical applications of computer science. She plans on getting a job in the biotech industry or joining a startup after graduation. Her other interests include film, EDM, Japanese, and cooking/eating meat that’s somewhat raw on the inside (real stomach of steel). &quot;All composite things must pass away.

However, he is a senior exec among iGEM members with a whopping 5 years of iGEM competitions under his belt. This is his second year on the Duke iGEM team after co-leading the Gaston Day School iGEM team for three years. He has a love for Anime/Manga like no other and listens to a variety of music, from Jpop and Bollywood to rap and heavy metal.
