        A project like this is not feasible without the kind support of a lot of different people and companies. This page is only for all of those who helped us with all kinds of advice, material and financial support, and of course also mental support in the phase of teambuilding. ;) The first members started meeting at the end of march, kindly supported by Jun. Prof. Maximilian Ulbrich and Dr. Nicole Gensch who have been working with the last two iGEM-team as well. As the project had settled and the first experiments were done we were really glad to welcome Prof. Wolfgang Schamel in the instructor team. </DIV></DIV><DIV class="color3"><DIV class="flippanel_group"><DIV class="outer_flippanel"><DIV class="flippanel"><DIV class="back card"><DIV class="back_content"><DIV class="profile-name">Wolfgang</DIV><DIV class="degree">Immunologist and Protein Biochemist - Professor at BIOSS</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="outer_flippanel"><DIV class="flippanel"><DIV class="back card"><DIV class="back_content"><DIV class="profile-name">Max</DIV><DIV class="degree">Doctoral degree in Biophysics - Research Group Leader at BIOSS</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="outer_flippanel"><DIV class="flippanel"><DIV class="back card"><DIV class="back_content"><DIV class="profile-name">Nicole</DIV><DIV class="degree">Doctoral degree in biology - Head of Toolbox at BIOSS</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="color6"><DIV class="para_center_20">The process of finding a suitable project can be really time consuming and frustrating since every project has their limiting aspect and the overall bounding time factor. After countless discarded ideas we started discussing the work of previous iGEM teams.
         “Beadzillus” by LMU Munich from 2012 caught our attention and interest. To get some inside into working with Bacillus subtilis, we were in contact with Julia Bartels from Munich who was part of said team from 2012. She has contributed a lot of material and gave us valuable advice to get started. She has helped us immensely which we are very grateful for.
         Once we had agreed on a project we could finally start working in our lab at BIOSS. The BIOSS institute is the reason we were able to take part at this year’s iGEM competition. Without its generous funding and access to its conference rooms, labs and hardware, we couldn’t have done it. A big thank you to the BIOSS.
         To cope with the work we separated the team in 5 “special forces” groups. Cloning - Spore production - Protein cleaning - Adhesion - Enzyme activity. You can see more about this on the Team page.
         On all parts of lab and experiments we get help from Adrian and Luisa. Not sure how to plan your controls? Ask Adrian and Luisa! They both participated in iGEM before and help us with protocols from their teams and general lab challanges. </DIV></DIV><DIV class="color3"><DIV class="flippanel_group"><DIV class="outer_flippanel"><DIV class="flippanel"><DIV class="back card"><DIV class="back_content"><DIV class="profile-name">Adrian</DIV><DIV class="degree">Beside working on his doctor thesis, Adrian was always there to support us.
