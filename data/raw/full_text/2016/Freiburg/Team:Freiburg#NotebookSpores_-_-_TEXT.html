Sporulation
Induced Sporulation according to protocol Sporulation
5 samples were inoculated to grow over night
diluted them to an OD= 0.1 (around), incubate them till an OD of 0.8 (so that they are in the exponential growth phase, probably takes around 3 hours)
Put an equal amount of DSM Culture medium and the sample in a reaction tube and were inoculated for 24 hours to from spores

Competent WT b. subtilis
Antibiotic plates for test transformation
–> the test transformation: there is a clear growth to see on the plate, but it was a wrong concentration of Cm (too low, that is probably why the WT grew so extreme)
2 samples of WT168 were diluted to an OD of 0,1 and put in 9ml Medium A to grow
Wait till they are past their exponential growth. That is you point t0. Now you let the samples stay in the incubator for another 90 minutes. You put 0,45ml of pre-heated medium B in eppis and add 0,05ml of the samples to it –> put in the incubator again for 90 minutes. Afterwards you should have very competent cells

starch plates for screening of the transformation
Plated 5 pbs1c single colonies on starch plate.
Prepared Lysozyme solution (30mg in 2ml ultra pure H2O) for Lysozyme purification. B46 and Wt168 Spores as well as their vegative cells were treated with Lysozyme solution (66µL solution in 400µL liquid culture) and incubated for one hour at 22°C. The cultures were centrifuged for 2 minutes at 13.000xg and 25°C. The pellet was resuspended in 500µL PBS. This was done twice. Afterwards the cultures were washed four times at 11700xg and after the last cycle the pellet was resuspended in 1mL PBS and send to FACS.
400µL of B46 and Wt168 spores and B46 and Wt168 vegetative cells were heat shocked for 50 minutes at 100°C. The cultures were centrifuged for 2 minutes at 11.700xg and 25°C. The pellets were resuspended in 1ml PBS and send to FACS.
WT168, cotZ,cotB, cotG, cgeA, B44, B49, B46 and B47 were inoculated in 3ml Lb and B52-56 in 3ml Lb for growth curves.
B46 and WT168 were inoculated in 6ml LB for sporulation.
8.08.2016
Growth curves
WT168, cotZ,cotB, cotG, cgeA, B44, B49, B46 and B47 were diluted to an OD of 0,17 and 200µL of each were filled into a ELISA plate with solid plastic lid. Growth curves were mesured.
aAmylase test was performed with 100µL Lugols'iodit per colony. Everything turned a dark shade of purple. (Note: Next time less Lugol's iodite and diluted and make a control).
Diluted overnight cultures of B46 and Wt168 to OD 0,1 and incubated them till OD 0,8. Centrifuge the cells at 13.000 rpm for 1 minute. Wash the pellet with bidestilled water. Resuspend the pellet in DSM (2,5ml for B46 and 4,5ml for Wt168) and let them grow over night.
Plated pbs1c single colonies on starch plate along with Wt168 colonies.
9.08.2016
aAmylase test
Did aAmylase test with pbs1c and Wt168 colonies (circa 100ul , but 2 to 1 diluted so the colour is not that saturated. The Lugol's iodite coloured the plate around the pbs1c a dark shade of purple and the colouring around the Wt168 was lighter than with pbs1c. This might mean that the transformation was succesful. Wt is capable of degrading starch, which showes itself in the lighter coloring. pbs1c is no longer capable of degrading starch and therefore showes normal colouring.
Let plate with pbs1c an Wt168 incubate further for increased starch degradation.
spore counting
Spores were counted and diluted in PBS to 200million spores per ml:
WT168: 512.000.000 and diluted in 6,24 ml PBS
B46: 588.800.000 and diluted in 3,888 ml PBS
–> made 10x B46 and 20x WT aliquots
Spore purification with lysozymes was induced (2samples from WT and B46): 1 to 6 dilution (83,3ml lysozyme and 416,66 ml samples) and in a heat block at RT for 1hour
the samples were washed with PBS for 6x and then diluted in 1ml PBS to freeze
WT, B53, B54 were inoculated in 3ml LB
10.08.2016
test with Lugol's iodine
pbs1c single colonies + WT colonies put on starch plate
add Lugol’s iodine on the colonies to see if the transformation worked
→ WT is able to reduce the starch, so there is no staining/colouring around the colonies (functionable α-Amylase)
→ the construct is not able to reduce the starch anymore so there is staining around the colonies
→ proves that the backbone got inserted in the right locus (amyE)
analysed growth curves
The growth curves were analysed:
CotG

Competent b.s. cells from cotB, cotG , cotZ and cgeA
Competent cells were made from WT, cgeA, cotB, cotG and cotZ
–> inoculate the strains in LB so they have an OD600 from 0,1-0,2 and let them grow for around 4hours (till they leave the exponential growth and then an additional 90minutes
After that you add 0.05mL of the culture into 0.45mL of pre-warmed Medium B in an Eppendorf tube and incubate it for another 90 minutes at 37°C
–> you should have highly competent cells (highly motile), to make glycerol stocks, centrifuge them for 3 minutes at 13.000prm and remove supernatant
–> you have to freeze them in 60% glycerol
CotZ: 15x
CotB: 15x
CotB: 15x
CgeA: 15x
WT: 6x
Plated cotZ , cotB, cotG and cgeA
18.08.2016
Sporulation did not work –> no spores. Maybe the concentration of DSM was too high and they didn't get a chance to sporulate
Purified aliquots from WT, B53 and B46
–> (diluted 1 to 6 (1,2ml PBS and 0,2ml Lysozyme) in lysozyme and incubated them at room temperature for an hour, wash 6x with PBS)–> still chunks in there maybe from the lysozyme

–> 2 Glycerol stocks were zenfrifuged for 20 minutes at 13rpm to remove supernatant and add 100ul of pre-warmed Medium B
–> add DNA and incubate it at 37°C for 30 minutes /1hour + plate it on the selection medium
WT168, B53,B54 and B46 were inoculated in 3ml LB
21.08.2016
test trafo (neu)
the test transformation did not work, the antibiotic concentration was probably not right since the WT control did grow and the transformed strain did not
–> concentration of spec was too low ( standard for e.coli) we need to double it
–> try it again today and check the antibiotic dilution (this time 50ul on 400ul on each plate)
trafo:
competent b. subtilis centrifuged for 20 minutes and remove all the supernatant and add 100ul of pre-warmed medium B
add the DNA (1ng and 50ng ) and incubate it for an hour
–> plate it in selective agar

Sporulation was induced with the strains WT,B53, B54 and B46 at 8pm
FACS
FACS with the purified spores from 19.08.2016 + 18.08.2016 and none treatet spores
22.08.2016
The induced spores were diluted with 1,2ml 1xPBS and 200ul Lysozyme to incubate for 1 hour at RT
–> afterwards they were washed in PBS one and the out in the freezer
test transformation
–> trip from Julia : spec 100ul (200ug/ml) on the plates
three competent cells were centrifuged at 13000prps for 20 minutes and the put in 100ul pre-warmed Medium B
DNA was added : 100ng DNA and in the other one 10ng
samples were incubated at 37°C for one hour and then plated in the selective agar
23.08.2016
Results from the trafo :
the plates were too highly concentrated but there was still a single colony growing on each of the plate (not the control)
24.08.2016
10 Starch plates were made according to protocol (note: add 1,5% agar) Culture medium
Transformation with the first constructs
first constructs are ready:
pBS1C pIG16_045 cgeA in cgeA k.o.
pBS1C pIG16_063 cgeA in cgeA k.o.
pBS1C pIG16_064 cotG in cotG k.o.
pBS1C pIG16_062 aGFPnano in cgeA k.o.
pBS1C pIG16_101 GST –> tomorrow
Glycerol stocks: 3x cgeA, 1x cotG and 1x WT –> centrifuge for 20 minutes at 13.000 rpm, remove supernatant and add 200 ml of pre-heated Medium B + mix thoroughly
DNA was added: 200ng DNA to each sample (not the WT168 since it is the negative control )
pBS1C pIG16_045 = 70ng/ul –> took 2,85ul for 200ng DNA
pBS1C pIG16_063 = 27ng/ul –> took 7,4ul for 200ng DNA
pBS1C pIG16_064 = 35ng/ul –> took 5,71ul for 200ng DNA
pBS1C pIG16_062 = 17ng/ul –> took 11,76ul for 200ng DNA
the samples were incubated for 1 hour and then plated on selective plates to grow (Chloramphenicol plates 1 to 5000 dilution)
25.08.2016
There is growth on each one of the plates (even the control) but it looks like e.coli (under the microscope you can see it is b. subtilis). Maybe the cm plates were too old. New plates were made and the colonies from the transformation were added to see if they grow
note : you have to autoclave the glycerol before you use it !!!
inoculated cgeA, cotB, cotG, cotZ and WT, B54 and B43 to grow in 2ml LB
26.08.2016
competent B. subtilis cells
The strains cgeA, cotB, cotG, cotZ and WT were grown over night and diluted to an OD of 0,1 to grow in Medium A (2ml) till they leave their exponential growth phase. After that there are incubated for another 90 minutes
Transfer 0.05mL of the samples into 0.45mL of pre-warmed Medium B in a tube and let them grow for another 90 minutes. Each tube resembles one transformation
WT: 16x
cgeA: 14x
cotB: 14x

the glycerol samples were centrifuged for 20minutes at 15000 rpm, the pallets were put in 100ul pre-warmed medium B and the DNA was added
samples were put in the shaker to grow for one hour and then were plated in selective agar (LB+Cm (1 to 5000)
The strains B53,B54 and WT were diluted to an OD of 0,1 and then grown till they reach their exponential phase (around an OD from 0,8)
The samples were washed with PBS once and then put in DSM for 24 hours to sporulate
27.08.2016
transformation
the trafo from this morning did not work (the Cml was probably too long on the plates without beeing spread –> So the concentration is wrong and the normal WT (control) can growth

I) preparation of the colony + controls
1. pick a colony
2. dilute in 10ul of Tris-HCL
3. 5min. on ice
4. 1min. microwave (at full power, gloves (!) + open the samples)
5. 30 seconds on ice
6. repeat step 3 and 4 twice (so that the samples were 3 times in the microwave in the end)
7. 5min on ice
For PCR each sample gets distributed into 3 samples: the 1st one has the primers 61 + 62
the 2nd one has the primers 63 + 64
the 3rd one has the primers 57 + 58
For one sample for PCR you use:
2×0,5MM 12,5ul (Aliquots)
Primer 1 1,25ul
Primer 2 1,25ul
ddh2o 9ul
