“This is my lab. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My lab is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my lab is useless. Without my lab, I am useless. I must work at my bench true. I must work harder than my fellow student who is trying to outdo me. I must leave after he leaves.  My lab and I know that what counts in science is not the sweat, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know that it is the result that counts. My lab is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its content. I will keep my lab clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other.“
Without a lab, there is no iGEM!! Luckily we  had  the opportunity to work in the lab of our main sponsor, the BIOSS. They didn't just provide the lab but also a lot of their professional equipment like the FACS, the fluorescence microscope and personal support. They kindly taught us the handling of the equipment. Without the BIOSS our great project would not have been possible. Fortunately, they also provided us access to the kitchen of the institute. Otherwise, possibly the half of our team members would have been starving or dying of  caffeine lack :).
