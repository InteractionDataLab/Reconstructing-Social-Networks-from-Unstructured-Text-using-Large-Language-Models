Group 3 - Expression analysis
Verification of the expression of the constructs is important to confirm the successful transformation into Bacillus subtilis. The used methods include SDS-PAGEs, Western Blots and flow cytometry analyses. Besides the confirmation of expression, flow cytometry is also used to confirm the binding of GFP to the aGFP-nanobody that is shown on the spores.
