Group 5 - Enzymatic activity and Sporeshampoo
The focus of this group lays on the confirmation of the enzymatic activity of our spores. To show that the GST is correctly expressed by the spores a GST-assay is adjusted to the use in a plate reader. Another application of the spores would be for a (anti-dandruff) shampoo, so this is tested by washing a GFP-coated surface with different detergents and our construct and measuring the fluorescence.
