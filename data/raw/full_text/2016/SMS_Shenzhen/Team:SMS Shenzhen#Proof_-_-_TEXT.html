Design:
Our bacteria express two fusion proteins: antimicrobial peptide LL-37 fused to motor protein yebf through a linker, and stromal-derived factor SDF fused with elastin-like-protein composed of pentapeptides repeated for 20 times ELP(20). We first designed the sequence of each using Snapgene. Then to ensure the function of each protein, we used Phyre 2 to predict the proteins’ three-dimensional structure.

We construct the plasmids: J04500 + yebf-LL-37 + B0015 and J04500 + SDF-ELP(20) + B0015. Then we synthesize them from GenScript. The electrophoresis results of these plasmids are as followings:
