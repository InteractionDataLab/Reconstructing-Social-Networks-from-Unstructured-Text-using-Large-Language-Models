Safety
General Safety
As our project focuses on biosafety, investigating whether kill switches can be reliably used as biosafety devices, general safety was something we regarded as very important. Our project poses minimal threat to individuals or to the environment upon accidental release, due to us only using Risk Group 1 microorganisms. However, we will still be taking all precautions to ensure no release of biomaterials into the environment occur.
Prior to beginning the laboratory work for our project, we all received a laboratory induction with Dagmara Kolak, the Mezzanine laboratory manager. As in standard with Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) laboratories, we signed the relevant lab safety paperwork and were guided through standard safety procedures. We were shown around the laboratory and introduced to the academics working in the laboratory, shown the locations of equipment and how to safely use it, and informed of the standard safety procedures for the Mezzanine laboratory.
All the appropriate COSHH forms were read and signed according to best laboratory practises and university policies.
Laboratory Safety
The Mezzanine laboratory is, as mentioned earlier, a Category 2 laboratory. By definition, a BSL-2 laboratory “is suitable for work involving agents that pose moderate hazards to personnel and the environment” (Gla.ac.uk). A BSL-2 laboratory builds upon the pre-existing safety procedures for a BSL-1 laboratory, but has some key differences:
Laboratory personnel have training in handling in pathogenic agents, and are supervised by scientists competent in handling infectious agents.
Access to the laboratory is restricted when work is being conducted.
All procedures involving infectious aerosols or splashes must be conducted in a biosafety cabinet (BSC) or other physical containment.
In the Mezzanine laboratory, we worked alongside Biosciences researchers from different backgrounds, and were given our own bench, storage areas in the freezers and cold room. We were also given full access to the equipment in the laboratory. As the Mezzanine laboratory is a BSL-2 laboratory, we had to follow strict safety procedures to prevent release of biomaterials and/or microorganisms into the environment.
During our project, we used E. coli strains BL21 DE3 and DH5α - They are classified as Risk Group 1 microorganisms (eur-lex.europa.eu, 2000). Risk Group 1 microorganisms do not cause disease in healthy adult humans, and can be used in a BSL-1 laboratory (2016.igem.uk, 2016).
To ensure we worked safely, and to prevent the possible release of biomaterials into the environment, we followed the procedures below:
When in the laboratory, lab coats were worn at all times. In the event of a spillage, normal clothing therefore isn’t contaminated and doesn’t risk biomaterial release.
When in the laboratory, nitrile gloves were worn at all times.
When leaving the laboratory, hands were always thoroughly washed.
For a sterile environment, we always used the flow hood to reduce risk of contamination. Before items or hands were placed inside the hood, they were sanitised and wiped down with ethanol spray.
For waste biomaterials and chemicals, all were disposed of accordingly to Mezzanine laboratory procedures to prevent contamination.
Certain items of equipment, such as the Autoclave, were to only be used by experienced members of staff who had been trained on how to use it.
