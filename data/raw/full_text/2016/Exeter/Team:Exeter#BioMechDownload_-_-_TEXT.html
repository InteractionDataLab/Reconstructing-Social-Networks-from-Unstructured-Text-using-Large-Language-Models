BioMech - Download
In an effort to make BioMech accessible to everyone, we have allowed the game to be open source and therefore it can be downloaded for free. Below you will find instructions    that will aid you in downloading and constructing your own version of the game. The materials required are as follows:
A4 Printer and paper (A3 recommended)
Guillotine or scissors
Glue such as pritt stick
Tape
A die
Pen and paper for score keeping
Software that allows printing (We will use Google Chrome)
Game Board
BioMech has its own game board allowing players to place their BioBricks    in to a plasmid.
Open the board game PDF files. If you have access to an A3 printer      click here , otherwise       for an A4 printers click here .      Both links open in a new tab.
If printing an A4 version of the game it is reccommended that you tape the two sheets      together. For a better experience the board can then be attatched to a cardboard box      to maintain its shape.
BioBrick Cards
In a complete deck there are 100 double sided BioBrick cards,    split in to four groups: Promoters, Ribosome binding sites,    Protein coding regions, and Terminators. The cards can be printed back to back,    on single sheets and stuck together, or single sided in order to save ink. It should    be noted that despite our best efforts the double sided printing option    may not always be correctly aligned.
Open the correct BioBrick PDF file. If you have access to a double sided printer      click here , and       for single sided printers click here .      Both links open in a new tab.
Press "print" and locate the printing properties for your browser and ensure      portrait printing is selected. For single sided      prints, do not change any options. For double sided prints select "flip on short side".      If you wish to save paper and ink here by printing only the fonts of the cards      only print odd pages (1,3,5...19), this is only recommended for single side printing.
If printing double sided use scissors or a guillotine to separate the cards.      If printing printing single sided stick pairs of pages back to back (5 and 6 for example)      before cutting.
Cards with can now be downloaded with the option of changing the text (using gimp software).     We hope this will allow people to translate the bulk of the text in to other languages.     Unfortunetely the names and card type titles can not be edited.
The files (.xcf) are the     file type gimp uses to save images, this program was chosen as it is free.     Links will download on click:
Promoter
RBS
PCR
Terminator
