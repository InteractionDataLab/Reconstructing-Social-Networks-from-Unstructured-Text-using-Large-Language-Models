The intensity of our light source.
A breif outline of the use of the light source:
Our project involved prodution of light dependant kill switches. These mechanisms are most active at  certain wavelengths. KillerRed is excited by green/yellow light (540-580 nm). KillerOrange excited by blue light (460-490 nm). To efficiently activiate these kill switches  we needed to provide light at these wavelengths at a reasonable intensity. We chose a light source consisting of a 4x8 LED array. With help from Ryan Edgington , we used an Ocean Optics spectrometer (USB2000+VIS-NIR-ES spectrometer, connected to a CC3 cosine corrector with a 3.9 mm collection diameter attached to a 0.55 mm diameter optical fibre) to measure relative spectra and intensity. We constructed a box around the light to prevent ambient light entering. Access to inside the box was gained through an opening cut in the front.
