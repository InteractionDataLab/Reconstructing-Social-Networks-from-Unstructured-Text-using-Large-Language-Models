					We discussed the idea of a killswitch in the pathogen responsible for Rice Blast disease and realised that we would need to spray an entire rice field for it to be effective. To overcome this issue we came up with the idea of using a genetic clock to construct a “time bomb kill switch” in which the killswitch was triggered by the build up of a specific protein.
				</P><P id="pp" style="padding-left:0;padding-right:0;padding-top:0;">
					We are very excited about the idea of creating a board game targeted at secondary school children. Some potential concepts included a set cards that have basic questions, a build-a-cell game where the first to obtain all necessary parts wins or a combination of the two.

					Today we had a meeting with Dr Nick Harmer who suggested we look at secretion systems in regards to the PAF idea. This would allow PAF to pass through the outer membrane of E.coli. He also put forward the idea of using a gram positive bacteria to get around the problem of the double membrane of the gram-negative <I>E. coli</I>.
				</P><P id="pp" style="padding-left:0;padding-right:0;padding-top:0;">
					There was a new idea created involving a novel method of spreading a killswitch throughout a population of fungi: a virus would act as a vector for a killswitch which would pass throughout a population of fungi via its natural sexual reproduction.. The virus could have the genes that codes for the production of PAF so when the viral genetic information is inserted into the fungus PAF would be expressed, killing the fungus. However our main concern thus far is how the public would perceive an idea like this.

					Following this we carried out research into current education on synthetic biology and unfortunately found there was very little education prior to postgraduate level, despite there being a fair amount of funding going into the field. In 2015, £40M was invested into synthetic biology research in the UK (see link) <SUP>1</SUP>. This has encouraged our team to want to look at potential ways to close that gap between funding and education, and introduce the synthetic biology earlier on. One way of doing this is developing a new module for the university.

					The work experience student worked through iGEM Labster and his feedback was that he thinks it needs better prompts to be more accessible. We spoke with him about his current GCSE syllabus, and found that synthetic biology could be taught alongside genetic modification and cloning. However, some students are confused between the differences of cloning and genetic modification. He also gave us his thoughts on the board game and overall he said it looks fun. 
				</P><P id="pp" style="padding-left:0;padding-right:0;padding-top:0;">
					Peter Reader, a past Exeter iGEM team member, spoke with us about potential problems to be careful of. He advised us to be wary of parts which haven’t been used much, as it tends to mean they haven’t been characterised well meaning more room for error. He also advised meeting multiple lecturers to have them pull our ideas apart, point out potential flaws and make suggestions to amend these problems. 

				</P><P id="pp" style="padding-left:0;padding-right:0;padding-top:0;">
					We also spoke with Ryan Edginton, a former iGEM member, about the wiki and the presentation. He gave us basic facts about the wiki, for example what happens on the day of the wiki freeze and required content.

				</P><P id="pp" style="padding-left:0;padding-right:0;padding-top:0;">
					He also gave us some more detailed advice about developing a brand for the project, including a logo and colour scheme, establishing a team leader for each section, fully defining the meaning of all equations used and explain the symbols and constants involved, and constantly keep testing on all internet browsers to ensure the wiki works on all browsers.

					A lot of today was spent working through past team’s projects to see what could be relevant to our project ideas, what couldn’t be completed in the past, what will be difficult, and what we could expand on for our own idea. There was a suggestion of using a delivery system, or developing a way to stick E. coli to the fungal cell wall to ensure delivery of PAF is direct.

					We made some slight changes to the board game cards today so we can incorporate the concept of scenarios, where the cards played by a team have to be justified. This makes the game a lot more interactive and encourages students to actually think about what cards they play, as opposed to simply playing cards to earn points.
				</P></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-12 div_log"><P id="pp" style="padding-left:0;padding-right:0;padding-top:0;">
					There was a lot of looking at past wikis so we could start forming an idea of what we wanted the layout of our wiki to look like.
				</P><P id="pp" style="padding-left:0;padding-right:0;">
					We discussed the PAF further. We did some research into the use of a secretion system to get PAF out of E. coli and noted how the mode of action of PAF is currently not well understood. We looked at how our project can tackle this problem, for example attatching GFP to the signal peptide known on PAF would allow us to “follow” it.

					Today was the first day with the majority of the team back together, so the key focus today was sitting down and re-brainstorming ideas before we settle on one. As can be seen in the mind map below, the PAF idea was fleshed out and developed in more detail.
				</P><P id="pp" style="padding-left:0;padding-right:0;">
					We wrote an improved proposal for both of the measurement projects about killswitches and genome integration.
				</P></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-12 div_log"><P id="pp" style="padding-left:0;padding-right:0;padding-top:0;">
					Some of the team spoke to Dr Mark Ramsdale, a fungal cell biologist. He gave feedback on the PAF dea, raising the question as to why we wanted to express PAF in E. coli as opposed to a fungus. Dr Ramsdale pointed out that due to how small PAF was as a protein, using GFP as a tag could affect how it is transported around the cell, and therefore skew the results. He told us about fungi specific promoters in Neurospora crassa which acts as a Circadian Clock using light and heat as inducers.
				</P><P id="pp" style="padding-left:0;padding-right:0;padding-top:0;">
					This prompted a discussion about using a viral vector that contains a killswitch that. The viral vector will insert its genetic information in the host, a strain of Magnaportha oryzae. The  Magnaportha oryzae would breed and the population would be infected with the virus containing the killswitch. The possibility of this being a heat activated killswitch was considered, so during the warmer months when plants grow the killswitch fungi is active to produce PAF.
				</P><P id="pp" style="padding-left:0;padding-right:0;padding-top:0;">
					Some of the team also met with Dr Nicky King, who is going to get us a stand at the Big Bang Science Fair for the South West (29.06.16) and the Britain Needs Scientists fair (06.07.16). She also discussed with us the possibility of writing an undergraduate Synthetic Biology module to be taken up by either Natural Sciences or Biosciences, and seemed very keen on the possibility of this.
				</P><P id="pp" style="padding-left:0;padding-right:0;padding-top:0;">
					We also met with Professor Rob Beardmore to discuss the genome integration idea. He said it sounds interesting but raised concerns about if it would even be possible to mathematically model it. He also liked the killswitch idea and said testing KillerRed and KillerOrange under a gradient of slowly increasing light intensity could be the strongest selector for resistance.
				</P><P id="pp" style="padding-left:0;padding-right:0;padding-top:0;">
					We also experimented with the vlog format, testing out the dynamics of using three people instead of two which we felt it worked a lot better.

					Today we have been preparing for the Big Bang Science Fair. We finished and printed off a poster showing how biology, chemistry, engineering and maths are all important in synthetic biology, a Synthetic Biology leaflet and an iGEM leaflet, the front and back of which are pictured below.

				</P></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-12 div_log"><P id="pp" style="padding-left:0;padding-right:0;padding-top:0;">
					Also, we completed two presentations on Synthetic Biology and iGEM which we intend to run on a loop on two iPads for the duration of the fair.

					The abstract for our project was written up and a basic form was uploaded to the Wiki. It focuses on how we can improve killswitches, as opposed to the initial killswitch idea of characterising the parts extensively. We intend to submit KillerOrange as our new part, and compare its functionality against that of KillerRed with a continuous culture. We also want to test if it is beneficial to have two killswitches in a system as opposed to one and look at the difference in stability of the killswitch if we integrate into into the chromosome.

They prepared cultures of Killer Red and Killer Orange for an upcoming experiment, and cleaned the mini stat chambers so they can be autoclaved and then used again.</P><P id="pp">They transformed DNAse1 and sent samples of the miniprep off for sequencing. They also prepared overnights of Killer Red and Killer Orange for repeat experiments, and performed overnights for the Interlab Study.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-12 div_content"><DIV id="contentTitle">

Whilst it will be a lot of work to develop a whole second module in such short time, it will be incredible if they are actually implemented. Pablo and Leanne began working on infographic designs to go up on the wiki, looking predominantly on visually explaining the mechanism of action of Killer Red/Orange, Lysozyme and DNAse1.</P><P id="pp">We sent off our Interlab Study data today to iGEM, in anticipation for the deadline tomorrow. We had decided to do the Interlab from the start as it would be a good way to introduce non-bio team members to the lab procedures, but when we chose Measurement track it also became a compulsory requirement.</P><P id="pp">Dan, Emily and Joel worked in the lab today. Killer Red and Killer Orange samples were diluted, exposed to light for 6 hours and spread plated. The construct overnights were grown from a starting OD of 0.02 for 6 hours then put through the FACS machine.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-12 div_content"><DIV id="contentTitle">

Leanne began to look at potential schools we can contact for distributing our board game, BioMech, as most schools as starting back within a week. </P><P id="pp">Andy worked on writing up what he had done so far for modelling, so that was ready to be put up on the wiki. Emily continued to work on developing ideas for the prospective third year module and trying to find ways that the third year module could build upon the second year one.</P><P id="pp">Emily and Pablo worked in the lab today - they did CFU counts on plates. Two of the spread plates - RFP 10<SUP>-3</SUP> in the dark and KO 10<SUP>-5</SUP> not induced - were found to be anomalous due to an issue with the spread plates used.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-12 div_content"><DIV id="contentTitle">

Dan uploaded and started to analyse the Killer Red and Killer Orange data from the last few weeks, and typed up the latest few lab book entries. </P><P id="pp">Emily had a meeting with Dr John Love and Dr Paul James about the second and third year modules we are developing - the meeting was very positive, with them giving advice on how to improve on the current module ideas. She also worked on the wiki home page, improving on what is currently written.</P><P id="pp">Leanne worked on writing up sections for the Human Practises page on the wiki - she typed up about the science fairs (Big Bang Science Fair and Britain Needs Scientists Fair), the work experience students who have joined us through the summer (Barnaby, Juliet and Jorge) and the data analysis on the BioMech survey we conducted at Colyton Grammar School.</P><P id="pp">Today’s lab team - Emily and Dan - prepared and autoclaved the ministat chambers so they are now ready for use, and set up a new configuration using 1L Duran bottles to deal with previous effluent problems. They also prepared overnights of Killer Red, Killer Orange, Lysozyme, RFP and the wild type.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
