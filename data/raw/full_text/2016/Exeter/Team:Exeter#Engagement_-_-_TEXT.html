Initially, we had the idea to create an educational synthetic biology board game called BioMech because we discovered the shocking lack of synthetic biology education in the United Kingdom. When we tried to address this lack of education, we spoke to Edexcel and they responded by saying that unfortunately there was no scope to change the GCSE syllabus this year; if we could create a ‘stretch and challenge’ tool then we could influence students at this level via an alternative method. The aim of BioMech is to introduce secondary and sixth form students to this scientific field in a fun and interactive way. The game teaches students about plasmid construction, biological parts and other essential biological concepts like mutation.
Why did we decide to create a board game?
After researching synthetic biology education in the UK,  we discovered  that there is a limited number of cheap and nationally   available educational resources for biology, with many teachers needing  to create their own material to inspire students. Furthermore, there is  also no education in synthetic biology for secondary school or A level students.
In response to this we decided to get in contact with Edexcel,  a GCSE and A Level exam board, and enquired the possibility of introducing  synthetic biology in the syllabus. They responded with “iGEM could produce   support resources, for the existing A level, which introduced ideas of   synthetic biology and which could be used as ‘stretch and challenge’   materials by teachers”. At this point we focused our efforts on making   BioMech an easily accessible educational tool that can be used alongside   the current syllabus, building on the cellular biology and genetics that  are currently taught at GCSE and A-Level biology.
The aim of the game
The game teaches students about plasmid construction,  biological parts and other essential biological concepts like   mutation. The game starts with 10 BioBrick cards for each player  who places 5 cards on the board to construct their plasmid. The   winner of the round is the player that designed the plasmid that  will be most useful in a randomly chosen scenario, the most appropriate   plasmid is determined by card scores and player discussion. After a round,   5 more cards are dealt and the game continues, the winner is the person that  wins the most rounds.
Initial testing at The Judd School (July 2016)
Playing the game
After making an initial prototype the team took the game  to The Judd School, a secondary school in Tonbridge,   United Kingdom, to be tested by a group of GCSE students. We started  off the day by introducing the iGEM project as well as explaining   a few fundamental synthetic biology terms such as BioBricks and   plasmids. After forming two groups, the students began to play   the game under our supervision and quickly grasped the rules.   All of the students got involved with the game, often reacting   enthusiastically whenever a mutation occurred in a cell.
Interviews and Feedback
Even though the game was a hit with the students,   we still wanted to determine if the game was a viable option   as an educational resource; the game needed to be able to educate  and inspire students. After the session we conducted a number   of interviews with some of the students, with a few saying that   they were much more likely to study biology after playing the game.
I barely knew about any of this before today, I’m definitely  much more likely to take Biology for A-Level.
We interviewed two teachers at The Judd School to ask if they would  consider using a learning resource such as our own in their lessons   and if they thought the board game would prepare their students for   entering iGEM in the coming years. The head of key stage 3, Dr Courel,   thought that as the game enables students to consider real life applications   for genetically modified organism, and that this would aid the students when   thinking about their own iGEM project. The head of biology at Judd School,  Mrs Andrew’s thought our game would make a great intermediate step between  theory in the classroom, and introducing students to the wet lab.
Improvements
The Judd School visit was both a successful and productive,   as we got plenty of high quality feedback from both students and teachers   on how we could improve the game to educate more effectively and reach out  to more schools.
The students suggested a number of minor improvements to   the gameplay through a short survey, the results of this can be found here . The largest change to our game came after Mrs Andrew’s   asked if she could keep a copy of the game herself. We knew that we could not  afford to give board games out too everyone, so we came up with a new way to   distribute our game at no cost. Our board game BioMech is now online to download   for free on our wiki here , with full printing instructions.  This meant that our original target of making our game accessible to all UK   students was a lot more realistic.

Production
After testing the game at a couple of science conventions  such as the Big Bang Fair South West and Britain Needs  Scientists , we were give feedback to help us make some minor improvements. After this was complete, we began planning manufacturing the game. The problem with manufacturing the game was that we didn’t have the funds to do it ourselves. However, we were very fortunate in the fact that Dr Mark Ramsdale was willing to give us the necessary funds for us to print 16 copies of the board game, in order for us to distribute these to schools, in a widening participation activity for the university. We then started to look into schools to distribute the board game to, which became extremely difficult as term finished shortly after. Despite the fact that we have the ability to distribute the game at no cost, with the downloadable version of BioMech developed, we wanted to give local schools, schools that have helped us along the way and under-achieving schools physical copies of BioMech. This would act as a thank you to the schools that have helped us on the way, but also provide an accessible resource to schools who may not have access to high-quality, modern teaching resources like our board game.
This new version of the game was played by students from Colyton Grammar School. As part of our initiative  to make BioMech accessible to as many GCSE students as possible  we have began leaving copies of the game at schools free of charge,   in order to benefit the education of synthetic biology for GCSE and   A level students.
The Colyton Grammar School visit occurred on 18/07/16. Four of our team members – Alice, Andy, Joel and Jack – ran a one hour board game session with a class of 26 Year 9 students, falling at the lower end of of our target demographic (14-18). In an attempt to better understand how BioMech had been received, we conducted a survey with the students. The raw data (PDFs of surveys) and the full data analysis are available upon request.
Of the 23 responses to question 7 - “Did our board game change your perception of synthetic biology? If so, how?” - 78.3% were positive answers that indicated the respondent had enjoyed the game and had learned from the game. Answers included “It helped me remember most of the information because it was fun and engaging” and “It was a fun way for learning about synthetic biology”.
The criticisms however were that it was difficult for the students to understand how the game works without having had a demonstration done in front of them, first. Because of this feedback, we aim to create instructional demonstration videos to accompany the downloadable, online version of BioMech in an attempt to make BioMech more sustainably accessible without the need for our team to be there.
We demonstrated this in a year 9 physics lesson and in both the presentation and activities with the students, we were able to highlight the physics applications alongside the biology ones. It is interesting, therefore, how well received the game was to both the teacher and the students considering that prior to our lesson with them, they might have assumed that synthetic biology is a purely biology-based field. Consequently, we want to stress that BioMech is a board game that can be, and has been, used in non-biology based lessons and we think is a great resource for teachers and students to engage with the field.
Future
Having tested the board game in the Judd School, Colyton Grammar School and two separate science fairs, as well as making BioMech available to download for free, we are looking to the future, to what we can do next. We plan on making BioMech as accessible as possible, thus are looking to create a Braille overlay version of the game, so that those people with or without sight can play simultaneously, and it not affect the game. We are also looking to make versions of BioMech suitable for those suffering for colour-blindness and have instructions written in multiple languages. We don’t want to exclude anyone from playing and using BioMech in schools, as we want to encourage any and all students to take an interest in synthetic biology.
We have also sent copies of BioMech to a number of schools in the UK and even in the US. Copies were sent to The Judd School and Colyton Grammar school, as a thank you for helping us develop BioMech throughout the progress however copies were sent to St Peter’s school in Bournemouth and Bishop Wand C of E school. The teachers of these schools are going to give us feedback on how the game works and what improvements we can make to make it more accessible and engaging for students. It is our hope that we continue to improve and adapt BioMech so that it can be implemented in as many schools as possible and become an essential teaching resource for high schools wanting to learn more about synthetic biology.
Mrs Hayley Andrews of The Judd School recommended we get in touch with The Institute of Research in Schools as well as the National Science Learning Centre to give BioMech the best possible chance of becoming implemented in schools. As a ‘future use of the game’, Hayley Andrews suggested that we could use BioMech as starter educational tool for students at schools wanting to take part in iGEM. As it introduces students to the fundamental principles of synthetic biology: plasmid design, biobricks as well as essential, more complex principles of biology like mutation - it would act as an engaging resource for high schools. Consequently, after the iGEM jamboree, we hope to continue to work on BioMech in order to distribute it to as many schools that need it, and try to encourage more schools to take part in the iGEM competition. The Judd School are planning on taking part next year and we have already established good rapport and potential for collaboration in the future.
On 13th October 2016 we received some images of Year 12 students at The Judd School playing BioMech and explaining the gameplay to other students. Ms Hayley Andrews exhibited BioMech as  an educational tool that would help Judd’s iGEM bid in 2017. Alongside DNAvigate and the Rolls Royce Science Prize, iGEM is explained as how The Judd School are trying to integrate authentic, practical and real-world biology into their teaching to give students the best possible education of science. Our board game will be used to introduce students to synthetic biology teaching them about plasmid construction, BioBricks and mutations, as well as individual parts from previous iGEM projects. We hope to have this kind of impact on more schools across the country, encouraging involvement of British schools in the iGEM competition.
Higher Education
Module:
Synthetic Biology is an innovative, exciting scientific field with applications in a wide variety of areas including therapeutics, the environment and energy. As an interdisciplinary subject, combining Biology, Chemistry and Physics, with Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering, it uses the talents of the best academics working in each of these individual fields. There is much interest at both university and high school level in learning and working in Synthetic Biology, as shown by the ever growing iGEM competition. However, despite this, there is a severe lack of Synthetic Biology education, especially in the UK. Currently, there is no Synthetic Biology education available prior to university level, and no intention to introduce Synthetic Biology into the GCSE or A Level curriculum in the immediate future.
We targeted high school education with our board game BioMech, however we also wanted to look at the impact we could make with the students, who will most immediately work and study further Synthetic Biology. We spoke to academics at the University of Exeter about the possibility of introducing a second year module into the syllabus teaching students the fundamentals of Synthetic Biology as well as an introduction to the applications to the field. We received good interest from both Bioscience and Natural Science departments. Dr Nicky King worked closely with us initially, liaising with us about the possibility of this module being available to Natural Science students and Bioscience students. We spoke to the Director of Education Dr Mark Ramsdale and he informed us of the logistical problems with creating a module for Natural Scientists and Bioscientists and after further communications with our supervisors and other academics, we began to focus on the Synthetic Biology module being a sole Bioscience module.
Other than the iGEM competition, there is no education in Synthetic Biology at the University of Exeter and the fact that each year, the iGEM competition was getting more and more competitive, showed us there was a gap in the market. Upon communications with and advice from various academics in the Bioscience department, we have come up with this second year Synthetic Biology module:
BIO20XX - Synthetic Biology
Module Overview:
Synthetic Biology is a new and exciting scientific field, with applications within medicine, the environment and energy. It is an interdisciplinary subject, combining Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Maths, Engineering and Computer Science. In this module you will learn about the creation of new biological systems and how they can be used to advance current technologies, with a focus on biosafety and kill switches.
Upon completing the course you should be able to independently construct a biological system, such as a biosensor, from a list of parts available. You should also be able to deploy research skills, basic laboratory skills and analytical techniques required in Synthetic Biology.
This module is a Second Year, Bioscience only module of 15 credits.
Module Aims - Intentions of the module:
ILO - Intended Learning Outcomes:
ILO: Module-specific skills
At the end of this module the student will be expected to be able to:
Understand and outline the fundamentals and framework of Synthetic Biology, such as cloning strategies, plasmid design, gene regulation and BioBricks
Outline and discuss the importance of biosafety, kill switches and bioethics within Synthetic Biology
Show competence in basic laboratory skills required in Synthetic Biology.
ILO: Discipline-specific skills
Describe and evaluate approaches to our understanding of Synthetic Biology with reference to primary literature, reviews and research articles
Describe in some detail essential facts and theory across this sub-discipline of the Biosciences
Identify critical questions from the literature and synthesise research-informed examples from the literature into written work
With some guidance, deploy established techniques of analysis and enquiry within the Biosciences
ILO: Personal and key skills
On successfully completing the module you will be able to:
Communicate ideas, principles and theories fluently by written means in a manner appropriate to the intended audience
Conceive and execute Synthetic Biology experiments within a scientific framework
Collect and interpret appropriate data, drawing on a range of sources, with limited guidance
Develop, with some guidance, a logical and reasoned argument with valid conclusions
Work in a small team and deal proficiently with the issues that teamwork requires (i.e. communication, motivation, decision-making, awareness, responsibility, and management skills, including setting and working to deadlines)
Syllabus Plan:
Journal Club:
To help students develop their research skills and discover the frontiers of Synthetic Biology, a journal club will run at the beginning of the course. Groups of students will be given different scientific papers and told to study it over the week using questions given to them to answer about. In seminars, run by post doctoral researchers who want experience in teaching, students can discuss the paper and the answers to the set questions, helping to develop their skills involving the analysis primary literature in a critical way.
Students will need to analyse the paper critically and gauge whether it is a successful paper. To aid students with this, certain questions can be set and discussed in seminars with the supervisors, and meetings with other students. These questions might include:
What is the context and what are the current hypotheses in this field?
How relevant to the field of Synthetic Biology is the paper?
Has this paper been cited before? If so, how respectable is the journal?
What is the rationale for the study?
What is the aim of this study? Is it clearly represented/logical and well reasoned?
What are the methods used in this study?
What are the key results and how are they evaluated/analysed?
What conclusions are drawn?
What are the implications for this research? Are there any future challenges?
Does this paper provide the foundations for more pioneering future research into Synthetic Biology?
This exercise will aid the student with the other papers during this module.
Lectures:
There will be a lecture series running throughout the module which aims to give the students a more comprehensive understanding of the theory behind Synthetic Biology as well as opportunities to look further at outside reading around the subjects studied. The students will study:
The Fundamentals of Synthetic Biology
Genetics overview/recap e.g. central dogma, mutations, gene splicing, nucleic acids etc
Molecular Biology recap
Microbial growth
Fermentation, bioreactors and microbial biotechnology
Factors affecting gene regulation
Circuit design and logic gates
Plasmid design, construction and sequencing and vectors
Biosafety, kill switches and ethics
BioBricks
Cloning strategies
DNA constructs and genome integration
Overview of biological modelling and design of experiment
The students will also support this theory with understand of the analytical techniques and practical skills in Synthetic Biology - which will be looked into further with the practical element of the module.
Practicals - in the latter half of the module:
Students will be given a list of parts, a selection of BioBricks, which they will later be able to access and told to design a plasmid which includes the gene that codes for the production of a fluorescent protein or biosensor for example. The students will have to research methods of plasmid construction and design an experiment; this uses elements from the journal club and the lecture series. They will then be tasked with constructing this plasmid in small groups (of around 4) in labs and if successful, the protein will be expressed.
Formative Assessment:
Lecturer and demonstrator feedback during practicals - assessed orally.
Summative Assessment:
The summative assessment will take the form of a mini iGEM project wherein the students will be assessed on three skills:
Presentation skills
Written skills
Practical skills
The students will have to use all they learned through the module, in the journal club, practical and lecture series to help them complete the project. The students will write up the practical project in the form of a short research article, including: abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion, conclusions and references. They will have to justify why they chose the BioBricks they did as well as show the implications of their findings and relate it to recent studies in the field. Despite having completed the project in groups, this will need to be done individually to avoid collusion and cheating.
The students will then have to present their findings to the rest of the students, judged by academics and industry guests.
The students will also have to create scientific poster and present it at a mini-jamboree. The assessment will be broken up thus:
Presentation - 20%
Poster session - 20%
Research article - 60%
Future Aims:
We aim to implement this module in the September 2017 curriculum for second year Biosciences, however in order to do this we need to keep liaising with academics in the Bioscience department and the Director of Education, Dr Mark Ramsdale. We want this module to inspire students to study further synthetic biology in the future, and give those who will apply for the Exeter iGEM team some experience of the competition so there isn’t such a steep learning curve to begin with. We hope this will make the laboratory work more efficient and the Biosciences students will be able to teach the students of other disciplines more easily, having been taught themselves by post doctoral researchers and potentially previous iGEM team members.
Desert Island... Science?
Desert Island... Science? Podcasts
As another part of our human practices, we wanted to focus on engaging the general public with all sciences but significantly, with synthetic biology. In particular, we have created 'Desert Island...Science?' based on the format of the popular 'Desert Island Discs' radio show. This asks guests to choose two songs; one book; one luxury item; and a piece of lab equipment to take with them to a desert island. We also speak with them about their thoughts on a range of scientific topics, including the future of synthetic biology; the importance of collaboration between different scientific disciplines; and the promotion of STEM fields to all members of the public.
The guests we chose represent a range of areas of expertise, including Prof. Richard Kitney, Co-Director of the EPSRC National Centre for Synthetic Biology and Innovation; and prominent theoretical physicist Prof. Jim Al-Khalili.
Prof. Kitney is a biomedical systems engineering professor at Imperial College London and has been a pioneer of the field of synthetic biology for over a decade. During his episode of 'Desert Island... Science?', we spoke to him about using our human practices work in engaging young people with synthetic biology and our iGEM project and he has this to say:
We're just at the start of this revolution in engineering and biology, the sooner you can get young people interested in this field and, in my opinion, the whole of science and engineering, the better
It was really gratifying to hear a very prominent and important figure in synthetic biology confirm that our education and public engagement work is important and needed for furthering the field of synthetic biology. Prof. Kitney’s comments reflected a view that was shared by many parents and teachers at the science fairs and schools we visited: new, educational resources for aiding teachers and students in topics such as synthetic biology are necessary and these resources don’t have to be limited to GCSE-aged students and above. In the future, we could look into creating a version of our board game suitable for younger students, and a version suitable to older students, to improve the accessibility to a wider audience.
On the subject of engaging the general public, he said that:
enthusiasm is the most important thing
in learning more about this exciting new field of science; which is something we want to encourage in all outreach work.
Another figure we spoke to was Professor Jim Al-Khalili, who works in the field of quantum biology as well as promoting equality and diversity in science. We spoke with him about improving the interaction and collaboration between different scientific disciplines, to which he said:
Synthetic biology is a very good example of where a multidisciplinary approach is absolutely vital
Having a prominent public figure, like Prof. Al-Khalili, highlight the importance of synthetic biology for science and research, we hope would relieve some of the biases and stereotypes associated with the field. As
synthetic
is synonymous with
artificial
and
biology
is synonymous with
life
, we can understand why many people we have spoken to, especially shown in the visit to the Judd School, think that synthetic biology involves
designer life
. If more public figures can comment on the positive aspects of synthetic biology, then it is our hope that the public can begin to see what synthetic biology can do for each of the individual, core subjects that make up it.
On the subject of equality and diversity within science he said:
we still have a long way to go... If 1 in 5 undergraduate physics students are female then 1 in 5 physics professors should be female - that's where the problem is and it just gets worse and worse as you go up the career ladder
This was a view that was highlighted with many of the physics students interviewed in the equality and diversity work, as well as many of the academics. The Institute of Physics recognizes gender distribution in physics as a major problem from base to senior level and if more public figures, like Prof. Al-Khalili, and more students publicise the problem, then it could encourage more time and money to be spent on fixing the issue.
By posting the podcasts on both YouTube and Soundcloud , we opened a two-way dialogue with the public, allowing them to ask questions and learn more. As well as this, we wanted to help ‘humanize’ academics and researchers by helping members of the public to gain a deeper understanding of the scientific research being done today. By reaching out to prominent researchers of academia, prominent researchers of industry and prominent public figures, we hoped to engage the public with synthetic biology and science in general at all the key areas.
We hope that by framing these important questions in modern science in a relaxed and informal manner, the general public will be much more likely to engage with these issues and learn more about research in the field of synthetic biology and other scientific disciplines.
Meet-Ups
Westminister iGEM UK meet-up 2016
In August we travelled to Westminster for the    iGEM UK annual meet-up, an opportunity to meet other UK teams,    discuss our ideas and projects and have a chance to practise our    presentation in front of students and academics. Although our    presentation was well received we were also given very important    feedback, such as why we hadn’t incorporated biosafety into our    game and our module. Since then we have rectified these issues.
Furthermore, we were given talks about   the fundamentals of synthetic biology and also about    conducting reliable surveys for our outreach.    We also had the chance to set up collaborations with Glasgow and Edinburgh in addition to   helping Warwick by directing them to schools and teams that    they could collaborate with or mentor.
Student Engagement
Science fairs and work experience students
Big Bang South West
The Big Bang South West Science Fair was one of the first places we tested BioMech. Our stall at the fair focussed on introducing students and teachers to synthetic biology and gathering information on how people perceive the field. Students were aged between 8 and 18, and there were teachers from a large variety of schools from across the South West.
For the fair, we wanted to show visitors the interdisciplinary nature of synthetic biology. We discussed how physics, chemistry, biology and engineering make up synthetic biology and demonstrated multiple applications within each of the core sciences. We created two leaflets: one which explained the basics of synthetic biology, and one which explained the iGEM competition. We made two companion powerpoint presentations to the leaflets which went in more depth, and played them on loop on two iPads on the stand. As well as this, we premiered a very basic form of our educational synthetic biology board game, for students and teachers try out. One student told us:
BioMech is more fun than the card games I played at a  card game convention in Birmingham
BioMech was well received by children of all ages, with the younger ones particularly enjoying the simplicity of the game and the clean aesthetics, whilst the older ones took a great interest in the descriptions of all the components as well as the mechanics the game offers. The fair provided us with some honest feedback from the children on our board game that we then kept in mind when designing our final version of the now highly user friendly and interactive version of BioMech.
We also drew inspiration from the ‘Activities Booklet’ created by the William and Mary iGEM 2015 team. The sweetie DNA construction activity proved incredibly popular amongst the younger students and gave us an opportunity to talk to them about basic genetics as well as some synthetic biology ideas.

Britain Needs Scientists
The second science fair was Britain Needs Scientists, hosted at the University of Exeter. This fair was aimed at students aged 16-18 who were interested in STEM careers. Here we focused on tying the STEM subjects into Synthetic Biology and were able to discuss more complex aspects of synthetic biology.
Work experience students
Barnaby was a year 10 work experience student who joined the team from 06.06.16 to 13.06.16. As we hadn’t started working in the lab at this point, Barnaby helped with our Human Practises. Barnaby was in our target age range for BioMech, meaning his voice was invaluable in designing the game and writing out the rules - he told us from his view what would be engaging, what would be too complicated, and played a large role in shaping the game.
Juliet was a year 12 work experience student who joined the team from 18.07.16 to 29.07.16. Juliet worked predominantly with the lab team given her strong interest in Biology, and was incredibly helpful. She helped specifically with important duties like making plates and media for experiments done by the team, but was also a helping hand for early cloning strategies. Due to Juliet being with us for two weeks and joining us later in the project, she was able to integrate with the team more and engage with the project to a greater extent than Barnaby was able to. At the end of her work experience with us, she gave us a card which said:
The past two weeks have been without question the most enjoyable and useful work experience I have had!
Our time with Juliet was a reminder of the direct impact our work could have on school students and gave us the drive to work harder on improving education and public engagement with synthetic biology.
George was a year 12 work experience student who joined the team from 01.08.16 to 12.08.16. George, like Juliet, worked predominantly with the lab team as he had a strong interest in Biology and had A Level knowledge. George also integrated very well with the team as he was with us for two weeks, and developed a vested interest in following the project after he left us.
Our time with each work experience was very useful for both progress in the lab or human practices, and helping us better understand our target demographic. Barnaby was particularly useful, being a GCSE student himself, for feedback on early versions of the board game. His insight was supported by students at the Judd School and thus we were able to improve and better the board game from the criticism and feedback of those it might affect. Both Juliet’s and George’s help in the lab was invaluable, at a time where we were particularly busy, however their individual feedback of the human practices work, allowed us to improve and develop our work on public engagement. We therefore recommend that more iGEM teams take on work experience students as the experience itself is both mutually beneficial and very enjoyable.
Other
Panel Discussion
On 14th October 2016 we hosted a Panel discussion on the issues of gender inequality and lack of diversity in science, to conclude our integrated 'Equality and Diversity' work. This was advertised on a variety of different social media accounts as well as on a webpage created by marketing and communications officer Ben May on the University of Exeter website. We created two way communications with the public through a variety of different media: the panel discussion was shown to a live audience, who participated in questions at the end; it was live broadcasted on Xpression FM (campus radio); it was live streamed on XTV (campus TV/Youtube channel). The discussion involved a panel of student and academic representatives who are both held at high regard by students, and distinctly knowledgable about the issues raised. Consequently, the panel discussion informed the public and opened up the potential for future discussion and debate on the issue. It fittingly concluded the integrated work of the equality and diversity section as the issues discussed throughout the student and academic interviews were further analyse and debated, but is also a great example of a quality public engagement activity. Since it was streamed, there was a live chat on Youtube where people were commenting on issues, but it is also now available to watch on the XTV Online channel for future feedback and engagement. You can find more about this here
Richard Dawkins Interview
We were very fortunate, on the 31st July 2016, to meet Professor Richard Dawkins in Exeter and managed to ask him some questions on his research and how best to engage with the public on topics within science. We filmed the interview, which can be found here : Professor Dawkins was in Exeter as he was speaking at an behavioural ecology conference held at the university. Prof. Dawkins emphasised the importance of research in behavioural ecology as it is
the explanation for why we are all here
and described how he felt about the University of Exeter:
I am very impressed with the University of Exeter, I haven’t been here before, it’s a lovely campus and it does seem to be the most thriving university
Prof. Dawkins went on to talk about his role as the first Charles Simonyi Professor for Public Understanding of Science and how we can best engage with the public on science. He emphasised how we have to be careful about the language we use as talking down to the public and not being clear may hinder their understanding of the topic.
I tend to perhaps err on the side of just putting it out there
An important factor that he highlighted that we, and other iGEM teams may not have considered is that encouraging the public to engage with the field might not be such an active process and may be more passive. We need to
rely on the fact that the science itself is utterly fascinating
and the public will seek it out if they have any kind of interest in it.
This interview informed us greatly as to how to better engage with the public. The video itself (at the time of writing) has 338 views, which is the highest viewed video on our channel. We therefore believe that a good way of engaging more people with our work and with synthetic biology, is by engaging more public figures with the field. This is what we ended up doing with our Desert Island Science podcast series (shown above), by interviewing celebrity scientists like Professor Chris Lintott and Professor Jim Al-Khalili.
Furthermore, Prof. Dawkins also gave us some really brilliant advice on how best to approach the public with such a complex and diverse field like synthetic biology. Whilst encouraging us to be clear and concise with our wording was just reassuring for us in what we have already done, the fact that he highlighted that we can be more passive in engaging the public with our field was more of a revelation because it meant that we could spend less time trying to find new, unique ways of publicising our work and more time making good quality content.
