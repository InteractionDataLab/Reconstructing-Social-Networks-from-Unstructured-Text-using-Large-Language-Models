Leanne Stanfield
Course: Physics MphysAge: 19
Hi! My name's Leanne, and I'm a first year Physics student from Birmingham.           I'm super excited (and grateful) to be involved with iGEM,          and it's definitely making me rather interested in Biophysics!          I really really really love coffee and lemon cheesecakes,           and quite enjoy going for runs.

Age: 20
Hallo! My name’s is Jack. I live in Cornwall, though I am originally from Kent.            I enjoy doing impressions, playing football and listening to an eclectic mix of music.             I would love to live and study abroad, however this may be a little bit difficult considering England’s current situation.             I am excited to be a member of the Exeter iGEM team as it is a fantastic opportunity for me to meet a wide variety of people from different countries and industries across the globe.

Eloise Lloyd
Course:Biochemistry BscAge: 19
Hello, my name is Eloise!          I am a first year Biochemist on Team Science for Exeter’s iGEM 2016 team.           Science is a big part of my life considering the dream is to one day help cure cancer.          The iGEM competition is proving to be an amazing platform for widening my view of science and exposing me to how different scientific fields can be integrated. I am originally from Essex so exploring Exeter’s beautiful countryside and endless hills on my bicycle is an excellent way to spend my summer when outside of the lab.           My other interests include yoga,          elephants and Formula 1, Team Lewis all the way!

Course: Physics MphysAge: 20
Hey, I'm Alan. I'm really into science. I joined the iGEM team so I could put the skills I have learnt in my degree into practice.            It's been great so far and I'm really enjoying the experience. I enjoy programming thus I'm one of the wiki guys.             I'm a massive sports fan. Rugby and skateboarding are my favourites, although I do love to surf when I get the chance.

The Team
Hi! We are Exeter University’s 2016 iGEM team made up of first, second and third year students of a wide variety of disciplines. We aspire to further the iGEM legacy, but we will settle for just getting something to work! We also aim to change the public’s perception of the field, distinguishing synthetic biology as a positive tool that can be used to combat key problems from multiple disciplines.

Course: Biological Sciences BsScAge: 25
I’m a first year biological sciences student,          my background is in art and illustration but I decided to come back to university to try something I’m not terrible at!          iGEM is a really exciting opportunity for me because there's lots of scope for creativity.           I love fungi, climbing, painting and playing music.

Course: Biochemistry BScAge: 19
Hello! My name is Emily.           I am excited to be a part of the Exeter iGEM team of 2016 as it is a great opportunity to get a taster of the various disciplines that make up synthetic biology,           as well as the chance to meet people from around the world who share a similar interest in science.           Outside of my studies I like running, cycling and bad science puns.           I am also interested in learning about health and nutrition.

Alice Redgate
Course: Bioscience BscAge: 20
Hello! My name is Alice and over the summer I’ll be documenting the progress of our team. I love filming and it enables us to reach a wider audience with what we are doing. I have also been working on the human practices side, travelling to schools to introduce our synthetic biology board game. Besides iGEM, I like producing videos for XTV (our student television station) for which I am Head of Factual on committee next year. I also love scuba diving and spent my gap year working as an instructor on the Great Barrier Reef. If you've seen our YouTube channel, come and talk to me at the jamboree!

Hannah Osborne
Course: Physics with Astrophysics MphysAge: 20
Hi, I'm Hannah, a third year student passionate about space research,           finding exoplanets and encouraging a new generation into science and space exploration.          Last year I helped set up Exeter University Space Society and climbed Mt Kilimanjaro to raise money for the charity Hope for Children.           I have had experience in science outreach with UKSEDS (UK Students for the Exploration and Development of Space) and presenting at the National Student Space Conference but I hope iGEM will give me a whole new set of skills,           starting with how to light a Bunsen burner!

Hi, my name is Andy. I have a passion for learning new things,          it’s one of the aspects that attracted me to iGEM. Being a physicist,          an opportunity to experience a whole new field of science doesn’t occur too often,           so I jumped at the opportunity. Outside of science I have a great interest in fitness and general well-being, whilst still appreciating an evening in with mates.

HI! My name is Pablo. I speak three languages: English, Spanish and French.          I also love travelling and meeting people with different backgrounds, as I believe that it gives a better understanding of how the world works.           Similarly iGEM has given me a better understanding of how all the different sciences are related and how collaboration between them is now more important than ever in order to progress in all scientific fields.

Hi I’m Joel, my main area of interest within my studies is biophysics. This led me to join the iGEM team to expand my knowledge and develop my research skills.          Other than science I listen to a lot of music, mainly rock/metal and I attend as many concerts and festivals as possible.           As well as this i enjoy snowboarding, rugby, gaming the list goes on.

I am a third year PhD student, working in the Exeter Microbial Biofuels Group.          I am attempting to develop a set of thoroughly characterised, robust synthetic          promoters in a non-model organism using statistical models that link promoter           sequence and structure to function. This is my first year being involved with           iGEM, but I have enjoyed working with the team and am looking forward to being           a judge in Boston.

I am a Research Fellow in the Exeter Microbial Biofuels group under the direction of John Love. Within the group, my research uses a synthetic biology approach to develop a molecular toolkit that will allow us to engineer and control both synthetic and natural biological pathways within a non-model organism. Although this is my first year as an official member of the Exeter iGEM team, I have watched previous teams develop and test their ideas in our lab. Their enjoyment and enthusiasm for their projects has been an inspiration to all of us and I am proud to be an active adviser this year. Good luck Exeter iGEM 2016.

I am a Research Fellow working under Professor Love in the Exeter Microbial Biofuels group with our research focusing on using a synthetic biology approach to producing customisable petroleum replica fuel molecules. I have been involved with iGEM since 2013 and i continue to be amazed by the range and depth of projects that our brilliant students produce year in year out and i am looking forward to another fantastic year.

Hey there, I’m Ryan, a third year PhD candidate in Biomedical Physics studying under Dr. Francesca Palombo. I’m developing an understanding of the fundamental biomechanics and structure-function relationships that govern the physics and chemistry of the extracellular matrix. The iGEM experience persuaded me to crack on and do a PhD at the Physics-Biology interface; I was a student member of our very first iGEM team here at Exeter back in 2012, and am proud to have been an instructor to our guys ever since. I can’t wait to see what Exeter have in store for us this year! Exciting times!
