		Please write 150 words on why you think your team is eligible for this prize:</P><P class="response">Our integrated human practices focused on the ethics, effects, and benefits of our system in an industrial setting. Through an investigation of literature and environmental data, we could conclude that our system would be energy efficient and cost effective for a lab to implement. Current problems with bioreactors are that they are expensive and inefficient, partly because of the need for human adjustment of inputs, which are affected by human error. An autonomous system would save workers time while producing less waste than current systems.</P><H3>Education and Public Engagement</H3><P>Required link: <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Washington/Engagement" target="_blank">2016.igem.org/Team:Washington/Engagement</A>This team can be evaluated for this prize.

		Please write 150 words on why you think your team is eligible for this prize:</P><P class="response">In this project, we utilized the engineering design process to take knowledge of a specific need in industry and develop a workable solution, culminating in a functional prototype device. Culture management is a vital task in synthetic biology research labs and in industry, but constantly measuring and adjusting culture conditions is time consuming, tedious, and inefficient. We worked to develop a system using control theory that automates cell culture management by adding inducer molecules in response to RGB measurements made of a culture tube. First, we designed genetic parts using the violacein pathway, which can yield four different colored outputs in response to stimuli. Next, we designed and built a chemostat and Raspberry Pi control system that captures images of the culture tubes, computes the RGB value, and directs the gradual release of inducer chemicals in order to change or maintain a certain color value over time. Finally, we plan to use machine learning to optimize our system, collecting data to formulate relationships between the measured RGB value and metabolite concentration. We hope that this will be an affordable, easy-to-use system that allows for more efficient and precise control of cell cultures, leading to a reduction in cost and waste for labs and companies that put it to use.</P><H3>Hardware</H3><P>Required link: <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Washington/Hardware" target="_blank">2016.igem.org/Team:Washington/Hardware</A>This team can be evaluated for this prize.
		Please write 150 words on why you think your team is eligible for this prize:</P><P class="response">The hardware component of our project uses control theory to mediate the function of the violacein pathway by automating the addition of inducer molecules and creating a feedback loop for maintaining color levels. To do this, we built a chemostat, which is a bioreactor that keeps yeast in constant log phase by continually expelling the bulk solution while inputting new media. This allows the culture to be kept in steady-state. In addition to this culture management contraption, we also built a system for image processing and response. To control the products being made, a camera controlled by a Raspberry Pi computer will continuously take an image of our yeast cultures. Through processing RGB values, it will determine the amount of metabolite in solution and send feedback signals to the culture management system to change inducer concentration. Thus, our device measures, computes, compares, and corrects, fulfilling each step of control theory. The device also uses machine learning to formulate empirical formulas relating the RGB value of the culture to the inducer and metabolite concentrations.</P><H2>Team_Parts</H2>
