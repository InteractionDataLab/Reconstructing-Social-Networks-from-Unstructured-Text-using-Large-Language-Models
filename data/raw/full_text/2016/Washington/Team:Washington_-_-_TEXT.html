Viva la Violacein
We've developed an autonomous control system for yeast cultures.Colored signals produced via gene expression are visually processed by computer and inducer chemicals are released as needed.
Project Description
Proof of Concept
We've designed a system for autonomously controlling cell cultures by sensing color production in yeast expressing the violacein pathway.

Wet Lab
We've created a strain of yeast capable of producing various pigments to indicate cell culture status.

Dry Lab
We've engineered an autonomous computer-controlled instrument using inducer-filled syringe pumps triggered by color changes to modulate culture growth.

Human Practices
We are passionate about educating the public about synthetic biology and have considered the impact of our system in practical use.
