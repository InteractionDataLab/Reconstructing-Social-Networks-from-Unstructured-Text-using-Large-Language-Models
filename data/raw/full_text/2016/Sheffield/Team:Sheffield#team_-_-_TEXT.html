Brandon Ford
Molecular Biologist of House Glow-in-the-Dank
Brandon is a Molecular Biologist and our team’s very own Pun Generator. He is sometimes known as the Brandopedia for his approximate knowledge of many things. When asked about his “inner funk”, his answer was “I would say that my skin is very good at keeping my inner funk inside where it belongs, but when that fails, I use a plaster or bandage.”         Brandon is a dispenser of accurate and valuable information and in general, a complete know-it-all cool dude. Hey can we have this list in surname alphabetical order? I don't want to be first -BF
Wesley Ho
Economist and P+P Co-ordinator of House Dorito-Dog
Wesley is an Economist and describes himself as a noisy character that likes to make sure that we’re all awake at every point of team time. He is passionate about Economics and enjoys teaching everyone and anyone who shows interest (this includes times when we’re all tired at the end of the meetings). He is often overwhelmed by the level of science but always does his best to understand and has become our ‘simplicity seal of approval’ for the scientists. He forms one half of Hansley #WeShipHansley
Hannah Macfarlane
Biomedical Scientist and P+P Co-ordinator of House Hannzilla
Hannah is a part-time Biomedical Scientist, part-time Policy and Practices enthusiast. She is always full of ideas for how we can interview and talk to more patients or people and is also the other half of Hansley (see Wesley above for first half). #WeShipHansley
Wai Ching Lin
Bioengineer and Modelling Expert of House Wai-Ching-For-Love
Wai Ching is a Bioengineering student that loves to model systems and do basically anything and everything computer-related. She is of House Wai-Ching-For-Love because if you replace “Waiting” with “Wai Ching” in Avicii’s song “Waiting For Love”, it actually sounds better. Go on. Try it.
Oana Pelea
Geneticist and Microbiologist of House Flower Fairy
Miss Pelea of House Flower Fairy is our team hipster. She always has a smile on her face and is consistently enthusiastic even when everyone else gets down. Almost devout to the ways of veganism with an exception from our trips to Paris, London and that takeaway…           Being of House Flower Fairy, she loves all life and treats her experiments like her babies.         She can be very nice but has a fierce streak to be blunt and ask people to get straight to the point. Beating around the bush is NOT an option.
James “you-havin’-a-giggle-mate” Gratton
Control Systems and Robotics Engineer of House Lubricator
James is our Chief Graphics Designer, Wiki Builder and All-Round-Tech-Monkey. He’s the genius behind our logo and our-all-time-provider of British slang...that’s where his middle name comes from. “U wot mate?” He’ would like to think he artistic visionary and is never satisfied with anything artistic.         Of House Lubricator (don’t ask), James is one of the three engineers from our team who has also quite recently been known for his obsession with carrots. #JamesAndHisCarrot
Magdelana Dabrowska
Biochemist and Head Microbiologist of House Vodka
Magda is the mama of the Microbiology. Yes, you heard us.          She always seems to know exactly what she’s doing and can be seen dashing around the lab working on the team’s next bacterial monstrosity.           Due to her Polish heritage and her belonging to House Vodka, she has acquired a high tolerance of alcohol, in particular vodka. Magda is always keen on sharing this talent with the rest of the teams on socials, even if they cannot possibly take another shot! Note to self: Do NOT enter a drinking contest with her.
Jamie "Jaimito" Grimshaw
Molecular Biologist and Modeller of House Sly Fox
Jamie is the calm and collected kid of the group. Of House Sly Fox, Jamie likes to play the Devil's Advocate in team discussions. In the man’s own words, “I am innately boring, but not to the point where that is particularly interesting.”
Jake Edmans
Chemist of House Troll
Jake, of House Troll, is the chemistry expert of the group.  But, he'll frequently don a disguise and work alongside the biologists, "Day 33, and they still suspect nothing." Jake will happily eat his whole meal and then take ALL leftover food donations from everyone else in the group.
Saylee Jangam
Bioengineer and Device Expert of House Jennifer
The Social Media Queen of the group, Saylee, has an endless list of contacts that she can talk to about the project. She is always pushing the team to be lively and even more social (even if most of them want a quiet night in to themselves). In Paris, Saylee found her belonging to her long-lost House, House Jennifer. For those who don’t already know, Jen is her not-so-annoying alter ego. Don’t worry, you’ll come across her in Boston.
