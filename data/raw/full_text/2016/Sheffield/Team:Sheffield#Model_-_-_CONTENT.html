The goal of modelling binding reactions is to find out the equilibrium concentration of the bound and unbound molecules. The rate at which the molecules bind to each other does not affect the overall time taken by the reporter system, as the pseudo steady-state approximation is assumed. In other words, as the transcription and translation of genes happen at a much longer timescale, it is assumed that the binding reactions would have reached equilibrium in this timescale and there is no change in the concentration of the bound molecules.</P><P>
Given a general binding reaction shown below, where ligands A and B bind to form the complex AB, the dissociation constant K<SUB>d</SUB> is defined as the ratio of unbound ligands ([A][B]) to bound complexes ([AB]). The concentrations here reflect the concentrations at equilibrium and not the instantaneous intermediate concentrations. Each binding reaction in the block diagram is a variation of this general binding reaction. Their nuances and how it affects the equilibrium concentrations are explained below. The dissociation constants and initial concentrations used are displayed at the end of this section.
</P><H2>Prepare Stock</H2><P>Fe<SUP>3+</SUP>, Ent and Che solutions are mixed together to form the stock solution. Ent and Che both bind to Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> and the equations for their dissociation constants are shown below. This differs from the general binding reaction as there are two receptors binding to the same Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> ligand; the equilibrium concentration of Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> should be the same for both equations.</P><P>Che here is assumed to be EDTA, as it is the most common iron chelator used<SUP>1</SUP>. It is assumed that 1 EDTA molecule binds to 1 Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> molecule<SUP>2</SUP>). The dissociation constants for Ent and Che to Fe are 10<SUP>-52</SUP> M<SUP>-1</SUP> and 10<SUP>-25</SUP> M<SUP>-1</SUP> respectively. The working concentrations of Ent, Che and Fe are within micromolar (μM) concentrations. Since the dissociation constants are at least 19 orders of magnitude smaller than the working concentrations, it can be assumed that 99.9% of Ent will be bound to Fe and of the remaining Fe, 99.9% of it will be bound to Che<SUP>3</SUP>. This approximation holds true if the initial Fe concentration is in excess of Ent concentration and Che concentration is in excess of Fe concentration.</P><P>Following the assumptions above, the table below shows the initial concentrations of Ent, Fe and Che added and the equilibrium concentrations of the complexes FeEnt and FeChe.</P><P><CENTER><TABLE class="modeltable"><TBODY><TR><TH>Molecule</TH><TH>Initial Concentration / nM</TH><TH>Equilibrium Concentration / nM</TH></TR><TR><TD>Ent</TD><TD>200</TD><TD>0</TD></TR><TR><TD>FeEnt</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>200</TD></TR><TR><TD>Fe</TD><TD>1 000</TD><TD>0</TD></TR><TR><TD>FeChe</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>800</TD></TR><TR><TD>Che</TD><TD>3 000</TD><TD>2 200</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></P><P class="modelcaption"><STRONG>Figure 1.

The equation for the dissociation constant of Fur binding to Fe is shown below. The concentration of FeFur<SUB>2</SUB> can be calculated by halving equilibrium concentration of the FeFur complexes, since it is assumed that dimerisation of 2 FeFur monomers happens much faster than the binding of Fur to Fe.

From the graph, it can be seen that the saturating conditions is around 2 μM of FeEnt. In order to produce the FeEnt solution at such a concentration, the Prep.

Hfq proteins facilitate RyhB-mediated degradation by helping to bring together RyhB and GFP mRNA. However, because it has been shown that <BUTTON class="btn btn-lg btn-danger" data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" title="RNA interference (RNAi)" data-content="The process in which RNA inhibits protein production by binding to the mRNA of the gene forming double stranded RNA which induces degradation.">RNAi</BUTTON> is largely dependent on the stoichiometry between the sRNA (RyhB) and the target mRNA<SUP>11</SUP>, it can be assumed that the binding of Hfq proteins is not a limiting factor. Thus, only the key molecules RyhB, GFP mRNA and GFP are modelled. The differential equations for these are shown below, where <I>s, m</I> and <I>M</I> represent the concentrations of RyhB, GFP mRNA and GFP respectively. <I>α</I> and <I>β</I> represent the production and degradation rate respectively.</P><P>The term <I>β<SUB>ms</SUB>[s][m]</I> represents the higher degradation rate due to RNAi. This term implies that the proportion of mRNA and srRNA that are degraded by RNAi depend on their concentrations.</P><P><I>pInit</I> is the probability that sRNA transcription will be initiated. This variable is absent from mRNA transcription as it is assumed that transcription will be initiated at every time step. When there is a higher concentration of FeFur<SUB>2</SUB>, there is a higher chance that FeFur<SUB>2</SUB> will bind to the Fur box and a lower probability that srRNA is transcribed. The probability of transcription is dependent on the affinity of FeFur<SUB>2</SUB> for its DNA binding site and is calculated by the formula below.</P><P>By combining this formula with the model for Fur Binding, a graph can be produced showing how free Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> levels affect <I>pInit</I> (figure 4). It can be seen that RyhB transcription drops sharply with an increase in Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> and is reduced by 90% when the concentration of free Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> falls to 2 µM. This suggests that RyhB does not display a range of expression that is proportional to the levels of free Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> but rather, it acts more like a switch. The srRNA is switched on under low iron conditions and switched off under high iron conditions. When determining the optimum concentration of ferric enterobactin to use in our system, we should aim for a concentration that results in RyhB being switched off in the case of a bacterial infection and switched on in the case of a non-bacterial infection.</P><P class="modelcaption"><STRONG>Figure 4. Probability of RyhB transcription against intracellular Fe(II).</STRONG></P><P>The intracellular Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> levels in a cell are not only affected by the rate of iron uptake, but also the production of ironbound proteins, which remove Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> from the pool of free Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>. So the differential equation used to model Iron Uptake is modified to include this.</P><P>In the differential equation above, the first term represents the increase in intracellular Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> levels due to iron uptake. It contains the Hill equation for iron uptake (see Iron Uptake), multiplied by a variable, which takes into account the change in iron uptake machinery due to the levels of FeFur<SUB>2</SUB>. This is because under high levels of Fe, FeFur<SUB>2</SUB> negatively regulates iron transport proteins<SUP>7</SUP>. The second term represents the removal of free Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> due to the production of ironbound proteins. These proteins are down regulated when Fe levels are lower than K<SUB>cut</SUB>. <I>[m]</I> represents the mRNA that is regulated by RyhB and the constant <I>b</I> represents mRNA that is not. Through testing different values and checking if the resultant steady-state Fe levels matches the Fe levels of the wild type strain (found through our <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Sheffield/project/science/detectingiron">ICP measurements</A>), this constant is found to be 0.435×10<SUP>-3</SUP>.</P><P>As our mutant strain is unable to produce Ent, its rate of iron uptake would be reduced. V<SUB>max</SUB> should be lowered to compensate for this. By comparing Fe levels produced by the model to the Fe levels found in our mutant strain (found through our <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Sheffield/project/science/detectingiron">Ferene Assay</A>), V<SUB>max</SUB> is found to be reduced by 39.6%. It should be noted, however, that when an FeEnt solution is added, the mutant strain would really solely on the FepA transport mechanism and so, V<SUB>max</SUB> would not be reduced in this case.</P><P>Using this model of GFP expression, we have found the GFP concentration at steady-state (assumed to be 24 hours) was the same regardless of whether the bacteria were grown in high (100 mM) or low (10 µM) iron. This matches the experimental results found (see <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Sheffield/project/science/furreporter">Fur Reporter</A>). When the transcription rate for a strong promoter was used, the model showed a higher level of steady-state GFP concentration, which also matches our experimental results (see <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Sheffield/project/science/furreporter">Fur Reporter</A>). Comparing the model with experimental results serve as a nice way to validate our model and ensure that it is accurate before we use it as a tool for prediction.</P><P>After coding for these different parts of the model separately, it is now time to link all the blocks together to produce some results.

Thus, after adding the blood sample, there has to be an increase in GFP concentration of at least 0.1 nM.

The maximum difference between them is around 0.3 pM, which is not enough to be detected by a fluorometer.

However, the maximum difference of 3 pM is still too small to be detected by a fluoromter. Since a tenfold increase in mRNA transcription rate resulted in a tenfold increase in the maximum difference, what the mRNA transcription rate would have to be in order to produce a detectable difference in GFP concentration.</P><P>We found out that the mRNA promoter would have to be ×100 stronger than the RyhB promoter in order for a detectable difference in GFP concentration. The graph of the maximum difference between non-bacterial and bacterial infections for a range of initial Ent concentrations at this promoter strength is shown below.</P><P class="modelcaption"><STRONG>Figure 7. Maximum difference between non/- bacterial infections for different initial enterobactin concentration (Ent).</STRONG> A promoter, which had 100× the transcription rate of the <I>ryhB</I> promoter, was used.</P><P>This shows that a strong promoter is necessary for our system to work and that it is important that the mRNA promoter is around 100× stronger than the srRNA promoter. The <I>ryhB</I> promoter is already a strong promoter<SUP>7</SUP> and further experiments are necessary in order to see if our reporter system can be designed with the necessary promoter.</P><P>If such a promoter were to be designed, we would then use figure 7 to find the optimum Ent concentration. Ent concentrations of 1.5 µM and higher have a negligible difference in GFP concentration between bacterially infected and non-infected blood. This is not surprising as saturating conditions for iron uptake is occurs at 2 uM (see <STRONG>Iron Uptake</STRONG>) so it would result in maximal increase in GFP concentrations and negligible differences. The graph also shows high levels of fluctuations. This could be due to the complex interplay between the iron uptake mechanism, RyhB regulation and intracellular Fe levels. It could also be caused by precision errors since time is discretised, i.e. concentrations are calculated in 1sec time intervals. The maximum difference occurred at 280 nM. At this concentration of Ent, the difference between the infection types would vary over a 2-hour period. The graph of the differences is shown in figure 8 below.</P><P class="modelcaption"><STRONG>Figure 8. Graph of the difference between bacterial and non-bacterial infection over time for an initial enterobactin concentration of 280 nM.</STRONG></P><P>The difference increases until it reaches a maximum at 77 mins. It then decreases, possibly because the bacteria would be starting to reach its steady-state by this time. The minimum detectable difference is 0.1 nM and this occurs at 12 mins. Therefore, if the right construct with the right promoter strength can be designed, our system would be able to detect the difference between blood with viral and bacterial infection in around 12 mins, which is near the desired amount of time specified by the doctor(s) that we spoke to (see <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Sheffield/episode5">Policy &amp; Practices</A>).</P><P>A limitation of this model is that it only takes into account the sensitivity of the fluorometer that is available in labs and does not necessarily reflect the sensitivity of the <BUTTON class="btn btn-lg btn-danger" data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" title="Light Dependant Resistor (LDR)" data-content="Changes resistance through the component based on the light intensity it receives.">light-dependent resistor (LDR)</BUTTON> contained in our device (see <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Sheffield/project/device/final">Final Device</A>). An extension to modelling would be to have some experimental data that calibrates GFP concentration to changes in resistance of the LDR so that we are able to see how changing variables like enterobactin concentration affects the electrical signal produced. Another extension to modelling would be to test the noise of the system to see whether the changes in fluorescence can be detected over the potential noise that this system has.</P></DIV></DIV></OL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
