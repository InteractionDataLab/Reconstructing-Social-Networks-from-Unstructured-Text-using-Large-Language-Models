HP SILVER
On the Sheffield 2016 wiki you can find an interactive timeline that narrates the story of our Policy & Practises investigation, and how the different milestones have had an impact on the design and execution of our project.
While brainstorming, as most of the expertise of the team leaned towards Microbiology, this led the team to decide the antibiotic resistance project. The first chapter of our story begins with the quest to answer the question, with the help of Dr Wainwright, of how we ended up in a near post-antibiotic era. The next step was to gain a better understanding of how many stakeholders were involved in this complex matter of resistance with the help of a politics lecturer. Moreover, during the early steps of designing a device prototype, the different end users were explored by approaching hospitals, doctors, patients, and government bodies.
The team also organised two mini iGEM competitions for 17-year-old students in high schools. The students were invited to a fair where we presented posters of previous iGEM projects. They were then divided up in teams with 1-2 iGEMmers to guide their brainstorming. In the end, advisors acted as judges, and gave out the prizes.
