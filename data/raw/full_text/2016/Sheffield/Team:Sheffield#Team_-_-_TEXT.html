Wesley Ho
Economist and P+P Co-ordinator of House Dorito-Dog
Wesley is an Economist and describes himself as a noisy character that likes to make sure that we’re all awake at every point of team time. He is passionate about Economics and enjoys teaching everyone and anyone who shows interest (this includes times when we’re all tired at the end of the meetings). He is often overwhelmed by the level of science but always does his best to understand and has become our ‘simplicity seal of approval’ for the scientists. He forms one half of Hansley #WeShipHansley
Hannah Macfarlane
Biomedical Scientist and P+P Co-ordinator of House Hannzilla
Hannah is a part-time Biomedical Scientist, part-time Policy and Practices enthusiast. She is always full of ideas for how we can interview and talk to more patients or people and is also the other half of Hansley (see Wesley above for first half). #WeShipHansley
Wai Ching Lin
Bioengineer and Modelling Expert of House Wai-Ching-For-Love
Wai Ching is a Bioengineering student that loves to model systems and do basically anything and everything computer-related. She is of House Wai-Ching-For-Love because if you replace “Waiting” with “Wai Ching” in Avicii’s song “Waiting For Love”, it actually sounds better. Go on. Try it.
Oana Pelea
Geneticist and Microbiologist of House Flower Fairy
Miss Pelea of House Flower Fairy is our team hipster. She always has a smile on her face and is consistently enthusiastic even when everyone else gets down. Almost devout to the ways of veganism with an exception from our trips to Paris, London and that takeaway…           Being of House Flower Fairy, she loves all life and treats her experiments like her babies.         She can be very nice but has a fierce streak to be blunt and ask people to get straight to the point. Beating around the bush is NOT an option.
James “you-havin’-a-giggle-mate” Gratton
Control Systems and Robotics Engineer of House Lubricator
James is our Chief Graphics Designer, Wiki Builder and All-Round-Tech-Monkey. He’s the genius behind our logo and our-all-time-provider of British slang...that’s where his middle name comes from. “U wot mate?” He’ would like to think he artistic visionary and is never satisfied with anything artistic.         Of House Lubricator (don’t ask), James is one of the three engineers from our team who has also quite recently been known for his obsession with carrots. #JamesAndHisCarrot
Magdelana Dabrowska
Biochemist and Head Microbiologist of House Vodka
Magda is the mama of the Microbiology. Yes, you heard us.          She always seems to know exactly what she’s doing and can be seen dashing around the lab working on the team’s next bacterial monstrosity.           Due to her Polish heritage and her belonging to House Vodka, she has acquired a high tolerance of alcohol, in particular vodka. Magda is always keen on sharing this talent with the rest of the teams on socials, even if they cannot possibly take another shot! Note to self: Do NOT enter a drinking contest with her.
Jamie "Jaimito" Grimshaw
Molecular Biologist and Modeller of House Sly Fox
Jamie is the calm and collected kid of the group. Of House Sly Fox, Jamie likes to play the Devil's Advocate in team discussions. In the man’s own words, “I am innately boring, but not to the point where that is particularly interesting.”
Jake Edmans
Chemist of House Troll
Jake, of House Troll, is the chemistry expert of the group.  But, he'll frequently don a disguise and work alongside the biologists, "Day 33, and they still suspect nothing." Jake will happily eat his whole meal and then take ALL leftover food donations from everyone else in the group.
Saylee Jangam
Bioengineer and Device Expert of House Jennifer
The Social Media Queen of the group, Saylee, has an endless list of contacts that she can talk to about the project. She is always pushing the team to be lively and even more social (even if most of them want a quiet night in to themselves). In Paris, Saylee found her belonging to her long-lost House, House Jennifer. For those who don’t already know, Jen is her not-so-annoying alter ego. Don’t worry, you’ll come across her in Boston.
Brandon Ford
Molecular Biologist of House Glow-in-the-Dank
Brandon is a Molecular Biologist and our team’s very own Pun Generator. He is sometimes known as the Brandopedia for his approximate knowledge of many things. When asked about his “inner funk”, his answer was “I would say that my skin is very good at keeping my inner funk inside where it belongs, but when that fails, I use a plaster or bandage.”         Brandon is a dispenser of accurate and valuable information and in general, a complete know-it-all cool dude.
Dimitrios Michailidis
House of Broccoli
Dimitrios is a microbiologist, with a obsession to find out what inspires people. When asked how he got involved with iGEM, he said, "I was presented in front of a panel of 3 agents, they might have just been professors. Frank Sinatra – I mean Frank Sargent of the United Nations, I mean University of Dundee, was staring at me through his dark sunglasses. Cigar in mouth. Next to him, his wife Tracy aka Scarlet, fresh from a saloon performance, and Tywin Lannister. I mean Tywin (Dyce Davidson) is a really nice guy after getting past his scary-looking face. Give him a beer, and he will go crazy at an iGEM party from starting a conga line to throwing an inflatable donkey to the DJ (who was also an iGEM judge)." He got so addicted to iGEM after being in a team in 2014, that he helped out the next team in 2015 in Dundee. Even when he came down to Sheffield for his PhD, there was no stopping him! Since there was no ongoing iGEM team at Sheffield, he just made his own!
Guilherme Kundlatsch
House of Brazil
A 19-year-old Brazilian Biotechnology student on a year-long exchange programme studying Molecular Biology at the University of Sheffield, Guilherme is a former handball player, former chess player, former writer, former iGEMmer and a dreamer, still searching for his place on this pale blue dot. Guilherme is always looking for his next, big adventure. “Let’s climb that sea-cliff? I’m in! Let’s dive in that waterfall in the middle of a mountain lost in the jungle? Count me in! Let’s do some sea kayaking during a crazy storm? I’ll be there!”. He has traveled to around 19 countries in 4 different continents doing crazy stuff – and he’s still working on this list. In his free time, he likes to write and his first book (a science fiction adventure) was published last year. He is also the only adviser not currently doing his PhD at the University of Sheffield – impressive stuff at just 20!
Kyle Buchan
House of Freedom
Kyle is a Microbiologist, professional science enthusiast, and a general all-round nerd. He got into this line of work when he sat down one day (around the same time he was told that the mitochondria were the powerhouse of cells) and realised that wee stuff was cool, partly because it could kill you, partly because it’s invisible and partly because there’s more of it inside you than there have ever been humans! His iGEM story started three years ago, when he was a ne’er do well Microbiology undergrad in his third year at the University of Dundee. They designed and developed a project called ‘Toximop!’ which involved E. coli engineered to soak up a common toxin in water bodies – microcystin. “Since then I have helped to start the Sheffield iGEM team, who are going to blow your minds with Iron and Blood!” he adds.
Felix Weihs
House of Thesis Panic
Felix is a 3rd year PhD student in Sheffield working on round bacteria around their roundness (actually true). To be able to cover his travel plans (he has one continent left!), he needs money and time. He thinks there is no worse plan than doing science research and if he thinks about it, he is doing something wrong. “Time to get a real job…” When asked how he got involved with iGEM, his answer was “Every team needs a German. It just works better this way.”
John Howard
House of Jukebox
John is a 1st year PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Science and the Department of Chemical & Biological Engineering who works on chemically improving RNA interference in insects. John originally did his undergrad in Chemical Engineering with Biotechnology, but decided hi-vis vests and hard hats didn’t really suit him, so traded in his distillation column for a pipette. John was roped into iGEM by Kyle’s “please help out with iGEM” presentation, where he’s pretty sure that Kyle used Jedi mind tricks to convince him….John is a musical nutter who plays the piano, saxophone, organ, mouth organ, oboe, spoons, paper and comb, empty beer bottles and pretty much any other musical instrument that happens to be passing, and has a some say lovable (some say annoying) tendency to break into song at the slightest provocation.
Nicholas R Moody
House of literally anything else
Nick is the advisor chemist. He is fascinated by the interface between biology and chemistry; life evolved using a minute amount of specific chemicals in specific conditions. Living organisms built instructions in DNA and molecular machines to control its environment and keep the essentials processes working. Multicellular system can sometimes seem almost mind boggling.  Understanding how fundamental chemistry interacts with the madness of life is what drives his personal fascination with science.He got involved with iGEM through Kyle, one of the other advisers. “Kyle and I both play in the university brass band,” he says, “We were both in the pub after a concert when he ambushed me, the idea of looking at an interdisciplinary project seemed fascinating, I could hardly say no!”
Jonny Coates
House of Shark
“I love what I do. Being on the very edge of what is known and unknown and bring the first person to discover something that no previous person has ever known is amazing,” says Jonny, “the child-like curiosity with the world never went away, it just matured into asking more questions.”  He believes he is lucky enough to do a job where not only does he get to continue asking questions about the world but also gets to go out and find the answers. When asked about how he got involved with iGEM, he said, “Kyle. It was all his fault…”.  Jonny isn’t your stereotypical scientist. When he’s not in the lab, he can be found doing a range of somewhat dangerous activities (motorcycles, skydiving, climbing…anything at the more extreme end of things).
Carlos Luna
House of Salsa
Carlos shared with us that when he’s not eating tacos (not from Tacobell at least), he’s engineering super intelligent systems for automatic control. His high tech robots will one day rule the world – save – I mean save the world. It’s not like the ‘Grey Hats’ are using his surreal programming skills for their own gains. When asked how he got involved, Carlos shared with us “That guy called Leon – I mean Dimitrios – Leon is his shadow – friend! – I meant friend, got me all fired up about iGEM”. Carlos disclosed a few words about Dimitrios’ approach of recruiting him. “There was a lot of pestering, nagging, stalking, and whispering”. Many people try to scout him to recruit his inquisitive – if he says so himself – mind.
Dr. Dorian Florescu
House of Florescu
Dorian is a fresh postdoctoral researcher at the University of Sheffield in the department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering. He supports the team by giving advice on mathematical modelling. When asked about how he got involved with iGEM, he said “I heard about the competition from Dimitrios and it instantly caught my attention!"
