In his free time, he likes to write and his first book (a science fiction adventure) was published last year. He is also the only adviser not currently doing his PhD at the University of Sheffield – impressive stuff at just 20!

Kyle is a Microbiologist, professional science enthusiast, and a general all-round nerd. He got into this line of work when he sat down one day (around the same time he was told that the mitochondria were the powerhouse of cells) and realised that wee stuff was cool, partly because it could kill you, partly because it’s invisible and partly because there’s more of it inside you than there have ever been humans! His iGEM story started three years ago, when he was a ne’er do well Microbiology undergrad in his third year at the University of Dundee. They designed and developed a project called ‘Toximop!’ which involved <I>E. coli</I> engineered to soak up a common toxin in water bodies – microcystin. “Since then I have helped to start the Sheffield iGEM team, who are going to blow your minds with Iron and Blood!” he adds.

Living organisms built instructions in DNA and molecular machines to control its environment and keep the essentials processes working. Multicellular system can sometimes seem almost mind boggling.  Understanding how fundamental chemistry interacts with the madness of life is what drives his personal fascination with science.He got involved with iGEM through Kyle, one of the other advisers. “Kyle and I both play in the university brass band,” he says, “We were both in the pub after a concert when he ambushed me, the idea of looking at an interdisciplinary project seemed fascinating, I could hardly say no!”

He believes he is lucky enough to do a job where not only does he get to continue asking questions about the world but also gets to go out and find the answers. When asked about how he got involved with iGEM, he said, “Kyle. It was all his fault…”.

Jonny isn’t your stereotypical scientist. When he’s not in the lab, he can be found doing a range of somewhat dangerous activities (motorcycles, skydiving, climbing…anything at the more extreme end of things).
