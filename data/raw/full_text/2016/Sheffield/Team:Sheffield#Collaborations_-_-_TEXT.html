The European iGEM meet up
Evry & Ionis-Paris
The European Experience, a collaboration between Evry and Ionis, held in Paris over the 2nd and 3rd of July, was a massive success. It attracted 28 European teams from 11 countries, where each team presented their project informally through a poster.
We discovered some exciting project ideas including producing bio-plastics on Mars, and building a DIY 3D printer for tissues.
United Kingdom iGEM meet up
Westminster UoW
In August, we were invited to the UK Teamsâ€™ Meet-up at the University of Westminster. Almost the whole team decided to head to London to interact with local teams and gain feedback about our project. It was a really friendly atmosphere when we arrived and we even bumped into the UEA (University of East Anglia) iGEM team on our way to the University as we both tried to navigate our way around London.
The meet-up was a two-day engagement and both days consisting of a number of engaging talks in the morning with presentations from other iGEM teams about their projects in the afternoon.
