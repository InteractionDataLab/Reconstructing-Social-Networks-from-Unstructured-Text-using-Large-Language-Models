THE FUTURE
Introducing our device to the market
Misusing antibiotics and manufacturing a device incur costs. The costs of mass producing a device should be less than the costs involved in misusing antibiotics, for the device to have commercial viability in the real world. This could be modelled by taking into account the cost of materials and distribution of a device, and comparing this to the effect antibiotic resistance and misprescription has on a system such as the
NHS
.
If our device were to become a widespread diagnostic tool, it would require approval from regulatory authorities such as National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO). Further, we would need to wait for rulings from UK and EU government commissions concerning whether
GM
live bacteria could be safely distributed within a healthcare setting.
Public and private healthcare providers such as the National Health Service (NHS) and British United Provident Association (Bupa) should be consulted as these would be the end-users. We could further improve the device by conducting widespread trials in partnership with our end-users.
