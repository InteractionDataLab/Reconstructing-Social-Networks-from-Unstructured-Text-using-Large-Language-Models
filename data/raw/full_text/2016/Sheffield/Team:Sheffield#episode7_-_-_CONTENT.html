This is a patient panel with a focus on infectious diseases, and sets up a dialogue between patients and clinicians, with a view to gaining a more personal perspective of antibiotic usage. </P><P>When asked about typical experiences when meeting with a GP, one member of the panel said that generally patients want to leave with a prescription; especially if they feel ill and think that they need something to help them feel better. Another panel member said that her husband never finished a course of antibiotics - he would take them until he felt better and then he would stop. If he then got ill again he would start taking the rest of the antibiotics, this was because of a no-waste attitude towards the antibiotics.</P><P>From our discussions we perceived that the general public’s understanding of antibiotic use was lacking, and this has been a driving force for misuse of antibiotics. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="box2"><DIV class="jumbotron"><P>Antibiotic resistance is a major problem as it diminishes the effectiveness of antibiotics.
