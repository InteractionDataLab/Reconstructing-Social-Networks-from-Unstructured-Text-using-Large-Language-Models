Parts Specifications
We designed a device that houses the electronics used to detect fluorescence as well as the capsule containing the bacterial solution. The device has been designed to be flat-pack (think IKEA) and cut out cheaply on a laser cutter. In order to build this device, we have laid out the blueprints of all the parts and their respective dimensions (in millimeters) below. The 3D Model section shows how the parts are assembled.

Figure 2 Blueprint for the back plate.
Figure 3. Blueprint for the base.
Figure 4. Blueprint for the front plate.
Figure 5. Blueprint for the back frame of the left chamber. The left chamber houses the electronics.
Figure 6. Blueprint for the front frame of the left chamber. The left chamber houses the electronics.
Figure 7. Blueprint for the middle wall. The middle wall partitions the left electronics chamber and right capsule chamber.
