We would like to thank all these amazing people for helping us on our project and getting this far to make it to Boston!
Project Support
Project Conceptualisation
Our advisors Kyle and Jonny came up with the project idea. One of our team members, Brandon, redirected the project from detecting siderophores to detecting lipocalin.

Lab Space & Consumables
Our advisor Dimitrios managed to procure part of the Perak Teaching Laboratories as our lab space after contacting Professor Goldman, Head of the Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the University of Sheffield. The Perak Teaching Laboratories and Professor Simon Foster Lab have provided us with equipment and lab consumables to conduct our experiments. The lab technicians Mel, Anne, Tom, Hannah and Josh helped us with using the equipment. Dr. Mark Thomas' Lab provided advice and a supply of siderophore null bacterial strains for our experiments. The Centre for Chemical Instrumentation and Analytical Services (CCIAS) in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Sheffield provided us with the equipment to make our ICP-AES Measurements.

Human Practices
Hannah and Wesley did most of the work for Human Practices, with help from James Gratton and Oana Pelea. Our advisor Dimitrios advised us on the direction that Human Practices should take. The rest are a list of people and organisations that we have interviewed as part of our Humans Practices. They include economics, politics and microbiology lecturers from the University of Sheffield as well as patients and panels from the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

Device
James Gratton designed and built the electronic device. Saylee and Wai Ching designed, built and tested the microfluidics chips. The Insigneo Institute for in silico medicine allowed us access to the Cellular Mechanics and Microfluidics Lab and provided us with materials and equipment for making the microfluidics chips. Dr. Cecile Perrault gave us permission to use her lab and advised us on the initial ideas for the microfluidics design. Luke Boldock taught us how to manufacture microfluidics chips. Both he and Claudia Wittkowske advised us on the design of the microfluidics chips. Dr Sean R Anderson advised us on the design of the fluorometer and a larger mixing device. Dr. David Chau advised us on the freeze-drying of our bacterial cells. Martyn Aspinall helped with laser cutting a prototype of the device.
