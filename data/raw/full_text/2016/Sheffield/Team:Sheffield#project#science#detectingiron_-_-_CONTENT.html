Therefore, we needed to demonstrate that the presence of siderophores increases intracellular iron levels, and to confirm that our JC28 strain does not produce enterobactin.</P><H2>The Theory</H2><P>Ideally, we would use the enterobactin deficient, JC28 strain and add known concentrations of siderophores into the medium, to see how it affects intracellular iron concentration. Initially, we cultured JC28 and W3110 in LB, assuming enterobactin production was the only relevant factor differing between the two strains.</P><P>ICP-AES is a test for total iron concentration, and detects both free and protein associated iron. Ideally, we would use electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and measure free Fe(II) concentrations in living cells directly, which would be useful for the mathematical modelling of Fur activity. However, we did not have access to this technique. Although, a larger amount of total iron would signify a higher free iron concentration, as iron storage is triggered by Fur, which responds to free iron concentrations. </P><P><SMALL><B>Figure 1. The emission spectrum of iron.</B> Specific elements can by identified by analysing the unique frequencies of light emitted upon de-excitation.</SMALL></P><P>To measure the amount of intracellular iron, we used ICP-AES. This technique allows the measurement of very low metal concentrations. The solution, in this case a suspension of lysed cells in acid, is passed through a nebuliser, to create an evenly dispersed mist. The mist enters a plasma formed through the ionisation of argon gas by high power radio waves. At temperatures above 7000 K, Fe(II) and Fe(III) are both converted to free atoms in the plasma, so this technique is not specific to one oxidation state. In the plasma, iron atoms become excited. As they de-excite specific frequencies of light are emitted due to quantum-mechanical effects. These frequencies are separated by a spectrometer and the intensity of emission is compared against known standards to calculate iron concentrations.</P><P>The data was normalised to the number of cells, based on the approximation that optical density is proportional to the number of cells, and that an <BUTTON class="btn btn-lg btn-danger" data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" title="OD600" data-content="The optical density of a sample, which is indicative of the concentration of cells.

We used heat to denature the ferritin proteins, and ascorbic acid as a reducing agent, to solubilise the iron and convert it from Fe(III) to Fe(II) (Fig. 4).

Volumes and concentrations are shown in appendix 2. Ascorbic acid is in a large excess, and samples were left for approximately 1 hour, to give a constant absorption. Therefore, all the Fe(III) will have been reduced to Fe(II).</P><P><SMALL><B>Figure 5.

The Ferene concentration is approximately 200 µM, therefore this shows that Ferene should be at least 5 times in excess of iron, to ensure full complexation. Since unbound Ferene exhibits low absorption at 593 nm, we used higher Ferene concentrations in our assay. By taking the gradient of the linear region of this graph, we can determine the molar extinction coefficient of the iron-Ferene complex. </P><P>Error analysis on the gradient of the linear region (Fig. 5) shows that the molar extinction coefficient of the iron-Ferene complex is 26100 +/- 300 mol<SUP>-1</SUP> L cm<SUP>-1</SUP>.</P><H2>Ferene iron assay protocol</H2><OL><LI>Grow 5 x 10 ml cultures for each sample in the required medium overnight</LI><LI> Centrifuge all cultures and remove supernatant</LI><LI> Resuspend all 5 cultures in PBS and transfer to a single tube</LI><LI> Wash 3 times in 1 ml PBS and recovered by centrifugation.</LI><LI> Resuspend in 2 ml PBS</LI><LI> Take a 100 µl sample and dilute to take OD<SUB>600</SUB> measurement</LI><LI> Transfer 1 ml into a fresh tube, recovered by centrifugation.</LI><LI> Resuspend in 1 ml of 100 µM ascorbic acid solution</LI><LI> Lyse cells by sonicating and ice shocking 4 times</LI><LI> Heat sample to 90 °C for 1 hour</LI><LI> Transfer 700 µl to an Eppendorf tube</LI><LI> Add 300 uL of 10 µM Ferene solution, mix and incubate for 5 mins</LI><LI> If precipitate forms, centrifuge, and transfer supernatant into clean cuvette</LI><LI> Record absorbance at 593 nm</LI></OL><P>We initially tried performing the assay without the concentration steps (2-3), but we found that this gave absorption values approaching the lower limit of our spectrophotometer. We also tried using hydrochloric acid to improve the solubility and increase the rate of reduction of iron, but we found that low pHs decreased the absorption of iron-Ferene solutions. We performed this assay several times using LB (data in appendix 3) and tried using minimal media. We found that using minimal media, even with the concentration step, gave inconsistant results towards the lower limit of our spectrophotometer.</P><CENTER><P><SMALL><B>Figure 6.

</SMALL></P><P>See appendix 3 for full data. Intracellular iron concentrations were calculated using absorbance at 593nm measurements with the molar extinction coefficient obtained from the calibration curve (Fig. 4), and the approximation that OD<SUB>600</SUB> is proportional to number of cells with a constant of proportionality of 8x10<SUP>8</SUP>. The error bars on the graph represent the standard error of the mean.</P><P>Although there was a large difference between the measured amount of iron in W3110 and JC28, the amount of iron detected was less than the amount measured using ICP-AES (Fig. 7). This suggests that, using this technique, not all the iron present is being detected. This could be due to the cells not being fully lysed or the iron not being fully released from proteins. </P><P>Due to time constraints this method was not investigated any further, but perhaps it could be improved by trying other lysis methods, or by allowing the reduction to take place overnight. We would recommend using Ferene as a cheaper alternative to ICP-AES, to measure iron concentrations at the micro molar level. However, this option remains technically challenging and more work is required to construct the experimental framework.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="box3"><DIV class="jumbotron"><H2>References</H2><OL><LI>Hennessy DJ, Reid GR, Smith FE, Thompson SL. <I>Ferene — a new spectrophotometric reagent for iron.</I> Can J Chem.
