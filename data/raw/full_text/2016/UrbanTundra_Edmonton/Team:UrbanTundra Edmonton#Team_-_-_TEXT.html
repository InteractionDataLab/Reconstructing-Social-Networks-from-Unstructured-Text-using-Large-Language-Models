The Team
UrbanTundra is a dynamic mix of students from three different high schools in Edmonton, Canada: Archbishop Macdonald, Harry Ainlay and Old Scona. Coming from all walks of life and diverse backgrounds, our team was an interesting blend of individuals all joined together with our interest in Synthetic Biology. With the help of our eccentric mentors from the University of Alberta, each and every member made UrbanTundra the unique team it is.
