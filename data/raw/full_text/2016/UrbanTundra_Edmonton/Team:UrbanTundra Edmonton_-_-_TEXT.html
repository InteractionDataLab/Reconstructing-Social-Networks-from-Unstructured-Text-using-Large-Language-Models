Urban Tundra Edmonton
We are Team UrbanTundra Edmonton; a group of passionate high school students brought together by a shared desire to learn and challenge ourselves in the field of Synthetic Biology.
The Goal
By using the tools of Synthetic Biology, UrbanTundra plans to show as a proof of concept that toxins in Martian soil can be converted to produce oxygen using an engineered biological system
The Future
With manned Mars missions approaching in the near future, a system such as this will be invaluable for Martian exploration and colonization
Why?
Reaching Mars would be a feat that could inspire a generation and development towards that goal, including our research topic, could potentially inspire many solutions for issues on Earth
