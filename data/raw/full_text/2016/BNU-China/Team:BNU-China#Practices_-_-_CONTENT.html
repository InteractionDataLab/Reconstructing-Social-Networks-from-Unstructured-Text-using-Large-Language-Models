                    Morbidity and mortality raising continuously, cancer is becoming a primary death reason and a
                    significant public health problem. As is reported by Chinese Cancer Statistics 2015, there will be
                    more than 4 million new cancer cases and nearly 3 million deaths of cancer in 2015. It has become
                    one of the most serious problems facing by China, even globe, to treat cancer effectively. </P><P>Aiming at different kind of cancers, different medicines and treatments have been developed based on
                    different therapy principles. However, the detecting and screening of medicines now is conducted
                    based more on chemical methods, which is sometimes complex and time-consuming. Inspired by the
                    properties of microtubule-stabilizing agent taxol, we developed a method to screen medicines based
                    on the microtubule stabilization. If microtubule-stabilizing molecule exists, our engineered protein
                    will polymerize and show light which can be detected through microscope. We expect it to be a more
                    sensitive and effective system to screen anticancer agents. </P><P>Our Human Practice is based on the project and included interviews, investigations and games we
                    designed.</P><VIDEO controls="" poster="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2016/f/f5/T--BNU-China--HP_video_poster.png"><H2 id="prac-Mini">Preparing before begining</H2><H3>Mini-iGEM</H3><P>We organized the Mini-iGEM competition, which took a month, before our project began. As its name,
                    the competition is for small iGEM projects designed by ten groups. They worked as iGEM's pattern and
                    designed a project or solved a problem using principles of synthetic biology. Then we invited some
                    professors to score these projects and give their advice. Through this competition, we found some
                    inspiring ideas and on the other hand deepened students' understand of iGEM. </P><P>Here are some of posters of Mini-iGEM.</P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><FIGCAPTION>

                    <I>Taxus</I> trees. However, since the great performance in curing cancer was discovered, yew trees
                    in Yunnan have experienced a period of massacre, which caused a sharp decrease in yew population.
                    So, in these years, the government has taken measures to protect them. Then we are wondering whether
                    those measures truly work and how is everything going with yew trees now in Yunnan. So we spend
                    several days this summer in Yunnan investigating the yew trees there. We went to some places
                    including Yunnan Hande Biotechnology Corporation which is the first producing source of taxol in
                    China, Yunnan Acadamy of Forestry (YAF) and Kunming Institute of Botany (KIB), Chinese Academy of
                    Science. Besides, we carried on population survey in Heilongtan Park, Yunnan University and Kunming
                    Botanical Garden.</P><P>From our survey, we learned that there are more and more yew tree plant bases coming into being in
                    Yunnan and they are mainly allocated at sipsongpanna, Wenshan, Diqing, and so on. The distribution
                    of wild yew trees is separated and in small population, for both natural and human reasons. In the
                    YAF, Dr. Jinfeng Zhang and his fellow said that it's important to nurture artificial yew forests,
                    especially from the angle of economy and forestry. The yew trees and its wood are both valuable so
                    the artificial forest is a great protection of wild trees. He said that, the yew trees do have other
                    values in addition to anticancer. For example, it can be used to treat diabetes, skin diseases and
                    sore throat. Besides, its wood is also precious (Though we can't agree with some of what he
                    said.).</P><P>As to planting yew trees, the farmers should get united with enterprises, who can give guide to
                    farmers and ensure the quality of yews. Some farmers just noticed the great profits in planting yew,
                    but had little techniques in it, which caused large loss to them. Besides, these cases was also a
                    waste of soil and resources. As a consequence, governments and companies should actively guide
                    farmers to plant trees, and it’s a win-win choice. </P><P>The protection of wild yew trees goes well in Yunnan province. And the support to scientific research
                    and forestry study from government are strengthened these years. As Dr. Zhang said, government
                    should focus on protection, and leaves the yew market to itself. The public attribute to yew trees
                    and its protection changes a lot among different people. Here is an overview of the public research
                    result.</P><H3>Public research</H3><P>In order to learn about the public attitude and knowledge to yew protection, we carried on a public

                </FIGCAPTION><P>People living in Kunming and surrounding counties have a better knowledge than tourists from other
                    provinces. In Yunnan province, many folk prescriptions mentioned yew barks as a traditional Chinese
                    medicine, which may be one of the reasons why people know a lot about medical therapy.</P><FIGCAPTION>
                    Fig.5 Knowledge of application of yews change with age.

                    Fig.6 Are there markets selling yew handicrafts

                    yew products while tourists know little about this. And after we ask further we noticed that these
                    markets usually distribute in the aggregation place of wild yew trees such as Lijiang.</P><P>Besides, over 90% people thought that there are not many yew trees in the wild and they needed
                    enhanced protection. But when it comes to the present situation of yew protection, the understanding
                    of different people varies a lot.</P><FIGCAPTION>
                    Fig.7 How does people thinks about protection of yew.
                </FIGCAPTION><P>The most locals thought that the protecting condition of the yew is unfavorable while people from
                    other provinces argues the opposites. After further study, we learned that there have been cases in
                    Kunming Botany Garden that people skinned the yew for money. And a sizable part of the old took or
                    are taking yew medicines like yew wine and so on. There are also some people collecting yew wood
                    chopping block, cups, and tea table.</P><P>Besides, we learned that the knowledge of yew mainly spread through leisure chatting or learn from
                    families and friends. Some of its information comes from sellers, too. Among people from other
                    provinces, some learned yew from internet or books, and some learned from sellers. So many yew
                    production sellers play an important role in popularization of yew science and the information they
                    provided needs to be standardized.</P><H3>Interview with Hande company</H3><P>Hande Biotechnology Corporation is a mature company with long history. As the first company in China
                    to produce taxol, it drew our attention immediately. They focused more on the profit of taxol
                    products and they are also playing an important role in yew resources protection. They now mainly
                    use yew trees tissue as a resource of products. Once upon a time, they were drew into a dilemma for
                    they were accused of using wild yew trees. The protective law being more and more perfect, this kind
                    of problems will no longer cause a debate. They now have their own planting bases and will develop
                    chemical synthesize method to make the production more profitable.</P><FIGCAPTION>

                    to argue about exploitation and protection politics of yew. Dr. Zhang said that all the artificial
                    yew forest need professional direct from academics or companies. And the taxol content in yew should
                    reach a criterion, which need chemical methods nowadays to analysis, to ensure the subsequent
                    product rate and quality. Our project can also be used in these analysis and may be more convenient.
                    Dr. Zhang’s view about protecting yew is that artificial forest is so popular that we don’t need to
                    constrain the yew productions in the market. What we should do is protect wild trees and now this
                    work goes generally well. So this market should be left to market itself to be regulated.</P><FIGCAPTION>
                    Fig.9 We are talking with Dr.Liu in Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS.
                </FIGCAPTION><P id="VOICE-FROM-SOCIETY"> Dr. Liu ‘s talk is mainly about the systematic evolution of <I>Taxus </I>species.
                    He has no idea about why some of <I>Taxus</I> species can produce taxol and how the difference of
                    taxol content in different species evolved. But he gave the phylogenetic relationships among present
                    <I>Taxus </I>species. And this talk makes us more reasonable when think about yews. <I>Taxus </I>is
                    just a kind of the miscellaneous plants in the world and he thought that the natural effect is more
                    important than human activities for he thought about this problem in a further larger time scale. We
                    noticed that though these people are all studying about the same species, they think about it from
                    totally different dimensions. That’s truly inspiring.</P><H2>Voice from society</H2><H3>Went to Pecking Union Medical College Hospital for an interview</H3><P>Different anticancer medicines are clinically used in different cases, depending on the condition and
                    illness history of the patient. And taxol, a broad-spectrum medicine targeting on the microtubule,
                    is just a choice for cancer doctors. We wondered how these taxol-like medicine are used clinically
                    and what problems they are facing. We went to PUMCH and get Dr. Yingyi Wang for an interview. </P><P id="prac-CCiC">As he said, taxol is a widely used medicine for many kinds of cancers. But it is the
                    wide-ranging that limits its application. Nowadays, targeted medicines which are initiated with
                    precision medicine have great advantages in treating cancer. In the other hand, taxol treatment is a
                    relative affordable scheme in most cases. From medicine history in a broader scale, small medicine
                    agents like taxol would possibly fade out in several decades and be replaced by targeted medicines
                    like antigen medicine or micro-robot which would have less sife effects and safer. However, our
                    engineered device is still work whenever people want to screen microtubule-stabilizing agents. </P><P>He is very interested in our project. <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:BNU-China/Engagement-PUMCH">Click

                        and understood the main key of iGEM. We learned a lot today, and the high tech equipment really
                        impressed me! I feel I am getting close to the mysterious scientific research. I hope to become
                        a part of iGEM and helping others.</P><P id="feedback-p3">The combination of the cross-country and the iGEM experiment is full of fun. And
                        as a sophomore student, I am very curious to iGEM, and I want to know more about it. I have
                        learned the detailed introduction to the laboratory and the project from seniors and get the
                        third place prize. I am happy to participate in this activity! I always want to get a chance to
                        train my laboratory experiment skills and do the experiment in the lab but I didn't find the
                        opportunity to do that, and this is one of the reasons of my participation. Finally thanks for
                        taking the time to further our understanding of iGEM. Happy :)</P></DIV><FIGURE class="text-center"><FIGCAPTION>
