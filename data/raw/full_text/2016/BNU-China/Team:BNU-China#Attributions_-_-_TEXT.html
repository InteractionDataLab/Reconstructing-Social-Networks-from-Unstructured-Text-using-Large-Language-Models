Project Design and Wet Lab Experiments
Under the supervision of Prof. Zhu Xudong, Prof. Yang Dong, and Prof. Xiang Benqiong etc, nearly all team members have taken part in the project designing process, especially those of wet lab group. Jingyu Zhao, Xinyu Liu, Jingqiu Lan are responsible for designing the experimental patterns and guided different parts of the project.
Modeling
Zhiyao Chen is the leader of modeling group, who mainly enrolled in designing the modeling details and was responsible for the collaboration with FAFU-CHINA in modeling. Zebang Li, Yujing Gao and Zexue He also do a great many works in the modeling group, such as information searching, paper writing and equipment appilication.
Wiki Construction
Xin Lv, who has led the web design group to build the wiki, together with group members Zitan Chen and Chengfei Peng.
Graphic Design
Shiyu He and Caixuan Xiao really do a fantastic work in graphic and web design. They all make great efforts in designing our team logo, website, poster, souvenir, T-shirt and so on.
Human Practice
Jingyu Zhao, Fansen Ji, Ye Tian and Nan Rong have organized a series of activities for Policy and Practice, like Mini-iGEM competition, interview in Pecking Union Medical College Hospital and so on. Some group members as Xinyu Liu, Yuhong Zou and Liufeng Dai play a significant role in planning and organizing the activities. Nearly all of our group members took parts in different activities.
