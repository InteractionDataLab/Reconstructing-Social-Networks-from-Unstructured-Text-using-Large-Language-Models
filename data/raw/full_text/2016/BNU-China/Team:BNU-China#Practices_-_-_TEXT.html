Why we do this
In recent years, cancer has become one of the most serious killers threatening human health.                     Morbidity and mortality raising continuously, cancer is becoming a primary death reason and a                     significant public health problem. As is reported by Chinese Cancer Statistics 2015, there will be                     more than 4 million new cancer cases and nearly 3 million deaths of cancer in 2015. It has become                     one of the most serious problems facing by China, even globe, to treat cancer effectively.
Aiming at different kind of cancers, different medicines and treatments have been developed based on                     different therapy principles. However, the detecting and screening of medicines now is conducted                     based more on chemical methods, which is sometimes complex and time-consuming. Inspired by the                     properties of microtubule-stabilizing agent taxol, we developed a method to screen medicines based                     on the microtubule stabilization. If microtubule-stabilizing molecule exists, our engineered protein                     will polymerize and show light which can be detected through microscope. We expect it to be a more                     sensitive and effective system to screen anticancer agents.
Our Human Practice is based on the project and included interviews, investigations and games we                     designed.
Preparing before begining
Mini-iGEM
We organized the Mini-iGEM competition, which took a month, before our project began. As its name,                     the competition is for small iGEM projects designed by ten groups. They worked as iGEM's pattern and                     designed a project or solved a problem using principles of synthetic biology. Then we invited some                     professors to score these projects and give their advice. Through this competition, we found some                     inspiring ideas and on the other hand deepened students' understand of iGEM.
Here are some of posters of Mini-iGEM.

Seeing is believing
Investigation of Taxus yunnanensis
The most famous microtubule-stabilizing medicine is taxol, which comes from extraction of Taxus trees. However, since the great performance in curing cancer was discovered, yew trees                     in Yunnan have experienced a period of massacre, which caused a sharp decrease in yew population.                     So, in these years, the government has taken measures to protect them. Then we are wondering whether                     those measures truly work and how is everything going with yew trees now in Yunnan. So we spend                     several days this summer in Yunnan investigating the yew trees there. We went to some places                     including Yunnan Hande Biotechnology Corporation which is the first producing source of taxol in                     China, Yunnan Acadamy of Forestry (YAF) and Kunming Institute of Botany (KIB), Chinese Academy of                     Science. Besides, we carried on population survey in Heilongtan Park, Yunnan University and Kunming                     Botanical Garden.
From our survey, we learned that there are more and more yew tree plant bases coming into being in                     Yunnan and they are mainly allocated at sipsongpanna, Wenshan, Diqing, and so on. The distribution                     of wild yew trees is separated and in small population, for both natural and human reasons. In the                     YAF, Dr. Jinfeng Zhang and his fellow said that it's important to nurture artificial yew forests,                     especially from the angle of economy and forestry. The yew trees and its wood are both valuable so                     the artificial forest is a great protection of wild trees. He said that, the yew trees do have other                     values in addition to anticancer. For example, it can be used to treat diabetes, skin diseases and                     sore throat. Besides, its wood is also precious (Though we can't agree with some of what he                     said.).
As to planting yew trees, the farmers should get united with enterprises, who can give guide to                     farmers and ensure the quality of yews. Some farmers just noticed the great profits in planting yew,                     but had little techniques in it, which caused large loss to them. Besides, these cases was also a                     waste of soil and resources. As a consequence, governments and companies should actively guide                     farmers to plant trees, and itâ€™s a win-win choice.
The protection of wild yew trees goes well in Yunnan province. And the support to scientific research                     and forestry study from government are strengthened these years. As Dr. Zhang said, government                     should focus on protection, and leaves the yew market to itself. The public attribute to yew trees                     and its protection changes a lot among different people. Here is an overview of the public research                     result.
Public research
In order to learn about the public attitude and knowledge to yew protection, we carried on a public                     research in Heilongtan Park, Yunnan University and Kunming Botanical Garden, Kunming.Here is our                     result.

At the same time, the understand of yew trees varies a lot in different people.
Fig.4 How do people from different places know about the application of yew trees
People living in Kunming and surrounding counties have a better knowledge than tourists from other                     provinces. In Yunnan province, many folk prescriptions mentioned yew barks as a traditional Chinese                     medicine, which may be one of the reasons why people know a lot about medical therapy.
Fig.5 Knowledge of application of yews change with age.
Among these people, the teenagers have a more comprehensive knowledge about the application of yew                     trees, while the old know more about the medical value of yew.
Fig.6 Are there markets selling yew handicrafts
Through the random investigation we learned that almost half of residents know some markets selling                     yew products while tourists know little about this. And after we ask further we noticed that these                     markets usually distribute in the aggregation place of wild yew trees such as Lijiang.
Besides, over 90% people thought that there are not many yew trees in the wild and they needed                     enhanced protection. But when it comes to the present situation of yew protection, the understanding                     of different people varies a lot.
Fig.7 How does people thinks about protection of yew.
The most locals thought that the protecting condition of the yew is unfavorable while people from                     other provinces argues the opposites. After further study, we learned that there have been cases in                     Kunming Botany Garden that people skinned the yew for money. And a sizable part of the old took or                     are taking yew medicines like yew wine and so on. There are also some people collecting yew wood                     chopping block, cups, and tea table.
Besides, we learned that the knowledge of yew mainly spread through leisure chatting or learn from                     families and friends. Some of its information comes from sellers, too. Among people from other                     provinces, some learned yew from internet or books, and some learned from sellers. So many yew                     production sellers play an important role in popularization of yew science and the information they                     provided needs to be standardized.
Interview with Hande company
Hande Biotechnology Corporation is a mature company with long history. As the first company in China                     to produce taxol, it drew our attention immediately. They focused more on the profit of taxol                     products and they are also playing an important role in yew resources protection. They now mainly                     use yew trees tissue as a resource of products. Once upon a time, they were drew into a dilemma for                     they were accused of using wild yew trees. The protective law being more and more perfect, this kind                     of problems will no longer cause a debate. They now have their own planting bases and will develop                     chemical synthesize method to make the production more profitable.

Yunnan academic of forestry
The interviews to Dr. Jinfeng Zhang from YAF and Dr. Jie Liu from KIB is mainly from scientific view                     to argue about exploitation and protection politics of yew. Dr. Zhang said that all the artificial                     yew forest need professional direct from academics or companies. And the taxol content in yew should                     reach a criterion, which need chemical methods nowadays to analysis, to ensure the subsequent                     product rate and quality. Our project can also be used in these analysis and may be more convenient.                     Dr. Zhangâ€™s view about protecting yew is that artificial forest is so popular that we donâ€™t need to                     constrain the yew productions in the market. What we should do is protect wild trees and now this                     work goes generally well. So this market should be left to market itself to be regulated.
Fig.9 We are talking with Dr.Liu in Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS.
Dr. Liu â€˜s talk is mainly about the systematic evolution of Taxus species.                     He has no idea about why some of Taxus species can produce taxol and how the difference of                     taxol content in different species evolved. But he gave the phylogenetic relationships among present Taxus species. And this talk makes us more reasonable when think about yews. Taxus is                     just a kind of the miscellaneous plants in the world and he thought that the natural effect is more                     important than human activities for he thought about this problem in a further larger time scale. We                     noticed that though these people are all studying about the same species, they think about it from                     totally different dimensions. Thatâ€™s truly inspiring.
Voice from society
Went to Pecking Union Medical College Hospital for an interview
Different anticancer medicines are clinically used in different cases, depending on the condition and                     illness history of the patient. And taxol, a broad-spectrum medicine targeting on the microtubule,                     is just a choice for cancer doctors. We wondered how these taxol-like medicine are used clinically                     and what problems they are facing. We went to PUMCH and get Dr. Yingyi Wang for an interview.
As he said, taxol is a widely used medicine for many kinds of cancers. But it is the                     wide-ranging that limits its application. Nowadays, targeted medicines which are initiated with                     precision medicine have great advantages in treating cancer. In the other hand, taxol treatment is a                     relative affordable scheme in most cases. From medicine history in a broader scale, small medicine                     agents like taxol would possibly fade out in several decades and be replaced by targeted medicines                     like antigen medicine or micro-robot which would have less sife effects and safer. However, our                     engineered device is still work whenever people want to screen microtubule-stabilizing agents.
He is very interested in our project. Click                     here to see the interview record.
Communicate in community
CCiC conference
During September 1st â€“ September 3th, 2016, CCiC conference was organized and held by Sun Yet-sen                     university in Guangzhou, China. Our team, BNU-China, had the chance to attend to the conference.                     During the conference, we introduced our project to the other 26 teams.
In the conference, each team conducted in-depth communication and exchanged ideas on their own                     projects. The inspiring spark collided by thoughts and innovation among the teams made the attendees                     reap substantial benefits. After careful preparation, we showed our project roundly to the whole                     attendees from the aspects of background, project, design, modeling and human practice. In the                     meantime, we also held open attitude towards the sincere suggestions and comments from other teams.

In the conference, not only did we strengthen the relationship with                     FAFU-CHINA, but we made many new friends as well. And the communication and mutual learning among                     the teams provided us with the opportunity to broad our horizon and help us acquaint more people                     with our project.
Orienteering game
What's the game
In order to facilitate the communication between the students and to help students to get a deeper                     understanding of iGEM. We designed and organized an orienteering activity "running of biology" in                     the campus. The rules of the orienteering are designed to bring our ideas to more people. The                     destinations were set at several typical buildings in the campus and was named by some                     representative chemical compound we have used or produced in the experiment, such as alpha protein,                     beta protein, N terminal of luciferase, c terminal of luciferase and some other organic molecular.                     The students were divided into several teams to compete with each other. Each team should find their                     destination by the description written on the task card to get a chemical compound. And then the                     team will obtain the task card leading to the next destination. The team that uses the less time to                     collect all the chemical compound will win the game.
Feedback
The orienteering is entrusted but full of joy and meanings. To start with, as a                         freshman who has little impression to the campus, the orienteering makes me feel more familiar                         to the college. What's more, the seniors in our team is so cute and my teammates is so bright                         and cheerful. Yesterday, we were strangers passing by each other but today we become a group,                         running and laughing in the school. At last the seniors took us to visit the laboratory, showing                         the ideas of iGEM, and I found it is really fascinating. I wish I can join in this group next                         year.
How time files! The orienteering has already ended. In this lively morning, we                         walked through the campus. We visited the stela in BNU, made new friends, looked around the lab                         and understood the main key of iGEM. We learned a lot today, and the high tech equipment really                         impressed me! I feel I am getting close to the mysterious scientific research. I hope to become                         a part of iGEM and helping others.
The combination of the cross-country and the iGEM experiment is full of fun. And                         as a sophomore student, I am very curious to iGEM, and I want to know more about it. I have                         learned the detailed introduction to the laboratory and the project from seniors and get the third place prize. I am happy to participate in this activity! I always want to get a chance to                         train my laboratory experiment skills and do the experiment in the lab but I didn't find the                         opportunity to do that, and this is one of the reasons of my participation. Finally thanks for                         taking the time to further our understanding of iGEM. Happy :)
