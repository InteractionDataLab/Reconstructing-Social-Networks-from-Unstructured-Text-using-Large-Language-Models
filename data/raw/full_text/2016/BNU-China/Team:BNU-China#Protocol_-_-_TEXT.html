Protocol
The SDS polyacrylamide gels are prepared in the so-called PerfectBlue™ Twin Double Gel System.
After ensuring that the equipment is waterproof, the 12% (or 18%) running gel is mixed and filled                     into the chamber. Pipetting about 1 ml of H2O on top of the running gel to seal the gel.
After polymerization, the remaining H2O is removed and the 12% stacking gel is filled on                     top. Insert                     a comb to create sample pockets.
After the stacking gel also polymerized, 1 x running buffer is used to run the Double Gel System via                     the SDS gel.
After loading the generated pockets with the samples, the stacking gel is run at 100 V and then                     running gel at 120 V.

Collect sediment after ultrasonication, use washing buffer including 2, 3 mol/L urea to wash                             sediment in turn. Finally, use washing buffer including 8 mol/L urea to dissolve. Centrifuge and                             absorb supernatant, measure protein concentration and make it keep about 1 mg/mL. Dialyze these                             supernatant using binding buffer including concentration gradient urea(6,5,4,3,2,1,0.5 and                             0 mol/L).
Extracting tubulin from porcine brains
Pick up 20 porcine brains from Beijing No.5 Meat Processing. For tubulin extraction experiment, the brains should be as fresh as possible. Take an ice box to store the brains.                             Avoid contact between the brains.
While getting the brains, another student should stay in the lab and prepared the centrifuge                             (set one at 4℃ and another at 37℃, also pre-warm the rotor). Put electronic balance, grinder, a                             graduated cylinder in refrigerator and pre-warm the glycerol and PEM in 37℃. prepare the fresh                             ATP and GTP buffer in the morning.
Clean the brain by tearing off the meninges and blood clots using kim wipes or by hand.
After cleaning, weigh the brains, put the brains in the blender, then add the same volume buffer                             PEM(with 1 mM DTT) in it accordingly.
Homogenate the brain for 3s, 10 times, time interval between two homogenate is 5s, in order to                             avoid destroy the tubulin because of high thermos.
Pour the homogenate into a flask, incubate in 4℃ for 30 min to depolymerize microtubules.
Pour the homogenate into tubes for Type 45Ti rotor and balance each tube.

Put the pellets in the                             Dounce grinder, then add cold PEM in the tube to wash off residual pellets.
Re-suspend the pellets with grinder, keep the grinder on ice, and grinding occasionally. After                             30min, pour out the solution and rinse the grinder with cold PEM. Total re-suspended volume is                             5 mL.

Store the sample carefully. Observe by transmission electron microscopy in Beijing Normal                             University.
OD350 test
Take out the tubulin monomer solution after precision purification from -80℃, and melt on the ice.
Prepare 10 um tubulin monomer solution with the same concentration, and add isopyknic                             polymerization buffer (the formula is the same as the polymerization buffer used in precision                             purification). This step finished on the ice in order to avoid the influence of the                             Spontaneous tubulin polymerization because of the high room temperature.
Prepare a series concentration gradient of taxol solution and add the                             tubulin polymerization system.
