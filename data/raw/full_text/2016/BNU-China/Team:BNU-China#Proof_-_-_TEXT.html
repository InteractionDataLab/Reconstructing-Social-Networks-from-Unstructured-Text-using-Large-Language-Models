Vectors of α-tubulin, β-tubulin, n-luciferase, c-luciferase
Gene fragments of α-tubulin, β-tubulin, n-luciferase, c-luciferase were amplified via PCR and                     verified                     by electrophoresis(Fig.1). The theoretic gene size of α-tubulin is 1356bp, β-tubulin is 1335bp,                     n-luciferase is 1248bp, c-luciferase is 459bp, which matched our experimental results.

Gene fragments were ligated to E.coli expression plasmid pET30a(+), after transformation,                     colony PCR was done to verify the efficiency(Fig.2A and 2B). Meanwhile, the sequencing results                     further confirmed that we successfully cloned the α-tubulin, β-tubulin, n-luciferase, c-luciferase                     expression vectors.

Fusion Protein Vectors
By fusion PCR technology
α-tubulin-YNE, YNE-α-tubulin, α-tubulin-YCE, YCE-α-tubulin, β-tubulin-YNE, YNE-β-tubulin,                     β-tubulin-YCE, YCE-β-tubulin, α-tubulin-nluc, nluc-α-tubulin, α-tubulin-cluc and cluc-α-tubulin were                     cloned respectively via fusion PCR. After ligating these fusion gene fragments to pET30a(+) empty                     vectors, we transformed the target plasmids to Trans5α. When colony PCR was done for screening, we                     picked correct colonies shown in electrophoresis gel(Fig.3) for plasmid amplification.
Fig.3 Result of colony PCR
Arrows show the correct size of fusion gene fragments:                             α-tubulin-YNE is 1866 bp, α-tubulin-YCE is 1650bp, β-tubulin-YCE is 1629bp,                             α-tubulin-nluc is 2640bp, α-tubulin-cluc is 1857bp.
Sequencing results further confirmed that α-tubulin-YNE, YNE-α-tubulin, α-tubulin-YCE, YCE-α-tubulin,                     β-tubulin-YCE, YCE-β-tubulin, α-tubulin-nluc and cluc-α-tubulin expression vectors were constructed                     successfully.
By Gateway Technology
We also tried to construct fusion protein vectors by Gateway Large-scale Cloning technology. We used                     Invitrogen pENTR/D TOPO to clone β-tubulin into entry vector. Primers were designed based on                     β-tubulin sequence and PCR was done for verification. Electrophoresis result (Fig.4) showed that                     β-tubulin was successfully cloned into the entry vector.
Fig.4 PCR verification result of the constructed entry vectors
In order to do LR reaction, we used the restriction endonuclease Not I to digest the entry vector.                     Electrophoresis result (Fig.5) showed that single digestion was efficient.
Fig.5 Single endonuclease digestion result of entry vectors
Using Invitrogen Gateway LR Clonase II Enzyme Mix, the entry vectors were ligated with                     pCambia1300-nluc and pCambia1300-cluc respectively. Thus the destination vectors were complete.                     After transformation and running PCR with β-tubulins primers, electrophoresis result (Fig.6) showed                     high positive rates, indicating β-tubulins was successfully cloned into the vectors.
Fig.6 PCR verification result of the objective vectors
Also, signaling fragments were also needed to be tested. By using the reverse primer of β-tubulin and                     the forward primer of cluc for PCR verification, we found that cluc-β-tubulin fusion protein vector                     is successfully constructed. Electrophoresis result is shown in Fig.7.

Arrows show the correct bands
In conclusion, we successfully cloned nine fusion protein vectors. α-tubulin-YNE, YNE-α-tubulin,                     α-tubulin-YCE, YCE-α-tubulin, β-tubulin-YCE, YCE-β-tubulin, α-tubulin-nluc, and cluc-α-tubulin were                     ligated to pET30(+) . β-tubulin was cloned to pCambia-cluc plasmid as a form of cluc-β-tubulin                     fusion protein vector.
Protein Expression
In TransB(DE3) E.coli expression strain
Expression vectors were transformed into E.coli expression strain TransB(DE3). After                     culturing,                     we firstly tested the effect of IPTG inducement. β-tubulin was taken as an example. SDS-PAGE(Fig.8)                     showed that IPTG is very significant in the expressing process.
Fig.8 SDS-PAGE result of β-tubulin inducement test (left to right: non-induced group, induced                         group), arrow shows the correct molecular weight of target protein(55 kDa)
the molecular weight of target fusion protein is 74.6kDa.                             arrows show the correct bands.
Then we checked the protein expression predicted website http://www.biotech.ou.edu/. It showed                     that                     our fusion protein would probably expressed as inclusion bodies. We therefore renatured the                     inclusion bodies and verified through SDS-PAGE(Fig.9).

the molecular weight of target fusion protein is 74.6kDa.                             arrows show the correct bands.
Also, western-blot(Fig.10) were done to test the protein from supernatant, pellet and renatured                     inclusion body.

Arrows show the correct bands of target proteins, triangles show the homologous                             tubulin protein(FtsZ,43kDa) from the bacteria.
In Rossatta(DE3) E.coli expression strain
Rossatta(DE3) is a kind of E.coli strain that can express rare codons and improve the                     expression level of eukaryotic protein. Thus we applied this strain to optimize our protein                     expression.
SDS-PAGE were done to verify the expression results before(Fig.11) and after(Fig.12) breaking the                     bacteria, and Western blot(Fig.13) was also applied for the further confirmation.

B: left to right: negative control in pellet, β-tubulin in pellet(55 kDa),                             β-tubulin-YCE in pellet (66 kDa), protein marker, negative control in supernatant, β-tubulin                             in supernatant (55 kDa), β-tubulin-YCE in supernatant (66 kDa), extracted β-tubulin(55 kDa).
Based on the results above, we could confirm that α-tubulin, β-tubulin, α-tubulin-YNE, YNE-α-tubulin,                     α-tubulin-YCE, YCE-α-tubulin, β-tubulin-YCE, YCE-β-tubulin, cluc-α-tubulin fusion protein were                     successfully expressed in rossatta cell.
Particularly, according to figure 7B, the target proteins (β-tubulin and β-tubulin-YCE) can be tested                     out in the supernatant, indicating that they are soluble when expressed in rossatta strain.
We collaborated with Fujian Agriculture and Forest University and asked them to test the interaction                     between α and β-tubulin. Thus verified the activity of tubulin monomers.
Fluorescence detection
Protein functional test
In order to make sure the protein expressed from prokaryotic cells had their functions. We did a                     functional test at first. Concentrated supernatant of α-tubulin-YNE and α-tubulin-YCE were mixed                     equally and treated with twice as much as the supernatant of β-tubulin. 50μM GTP and 200μM taxol                     were also added for helping aggregation. After incubated in 37℃ for 1 hour，the mixture was tested by                     the absolute recording spectrofluorometer. The result(Fig.14) showed there was a significant                     emission peak in 525nm with the excitation in near 512nm wave length, indicating that YCE and YNE                     protein fragments were combined as a whole YFP and thus verifying their biological functions in                         vitro.
Also, equally mixed α-tubulin-YNE and β-tubulin-YCE treated with 50μM GTP and 200μM taxol indicated                     the existed α-β tubulin interaction and the YNE-YCE combination.

Taxol-concentration based assay
After protein functions were confirmed, we further tested the microtubule aggregation level by                     treating serial concentration of taxol samples. Since the excess amount of substrate proteins                     (α-tubulin-YNE, α-tubulin-YCE and β-tubulin) were treated. The aggregation level could be represented by the fluorescence intensity. The experimental results (Fig.15 Table 1) showed that                     there is an obvious positive correlation between taxol concentration and fluorescence intensity when                     the substrate proteins are abundant.

Further visualized experiment was also carried out. As the aggregated tubulins could be centrifuged                     in room temperature while the tubulin monomers could not. As enough protein substrates                     (α-tubulin-YNE, α-tubulin-YCE and β-tubulin) existed, we centrifuged each experimental group.                     Results(Fig.16) showed obvious difference between each group with serial taxol concentration, further                     indicating that the taxol concentration can be represented by the tubulin aggregation level.

Based on the statistics above, any random concentration of taxol could be figured out in the following Polynomial interpolation curve(Fig.17).

Results of tublin extraction in vitro
After successfully extracting tubulin from porcine brains, we tried to summarize the aggregation                     condition in vitro by using electron microscope.
Fig.18 Aggregated microtubule treated with 1μM taxol
From pictures taken under the electron microscope(Fig.18), we could see tublin (treated with 1 μM                     taxol) in aggregated form obviously, indicating we have achieved the aggregation process in                         vitro. However, due to the high concentration of our extracted sample, it was hard to tell                     the aggregated length and the quantity of microtubules. Thus we tried to use spectrophotometer to                     measure OD350 of our experimental samples.

From the results shown in table 2, we found that there was no obvious relationship between OD                     statistics and taxol concentration. The reason may be the machine issue. Due to the wave length for                     measuring OD is 350nm, which is between the ultraviolet light and visible light, there is a high                     requirement for instruments and always leads to a huge deviation. As the high technologic                     instruments could not be owned by every laboratory in different areas, our fusion proteins which can                     detect the relatively accurate concentration of anti-microtubule drugs will have a broad application                     prospect.
