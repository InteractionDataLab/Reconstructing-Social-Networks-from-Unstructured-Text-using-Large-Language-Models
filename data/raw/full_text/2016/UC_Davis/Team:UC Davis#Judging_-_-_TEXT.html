Part Contribution: Documentation that a new standard BioBrick Part was submitted to iGEM registry
Silver
Validated Part : Experimental Verification/Validation that at least one new BioBrick Part works as expected
Collaborations : Worked with UCSC closely on human practices and on B. subtilis research methods (see relevant documentation on the wiki)
Human Practices : Extensive probing performed to understand how our science and society synergistically shape one another
Gold
Human Practices : Extensive probing performed to understand how our science and society synergistically shape one another, with special focus on investigating issues within the human practices frontier and how this will impact design and execution of the project
Proof of Concept : Our project demonstrates that the GAF protein could be a viable natural alternative to artificial food dyes. In real-world applications our project would need to evaluated under color properties, protein properties, production capabilities, safety, environmental effects, and societal effects. Within our project we address at least one aspect of these major concerns to represent a broad proof-of-concept that GAF proteins could be brought into industry and further the human food system
