The Team
Samir Akre
I'm an incoming 3rd year at UC Davis studying Biomedical Engineering with a hopeful minor in Quantitative Biology and Bioinformatics. I currently do research at the Passerini lab studying atherosclerosis and the Mills lab studying infant gut microbiology. I'm a brother of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity (TKE), Tau Beta Pi engineering honors society (TBP), and the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES). I play the guitar, have a black belt in Tae Kwon Do, love making artisan coffee, and used to be on a competitive dance team!
Amanda Everitt
I’m a senior at UC Davis majoring in Biotechnology-Bioinformatics. I’m particularly interested in improving computational aspects of metagenome studies. Currently, I work in Jonathan Eisen’s Lab handling and refining microbiome data and the Vector Genetics Lab studying malaria transmitting Anopheles mosquitoes. When I’m not consumed in my computer, I focus my time on cooking and watching crummy 80s movies.
Jonathan Chen
I recently graduated with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, with a double emphasis in cell/tissue engineering and medical devices. I’ve worked in the TEAM MPBIL for the past year conducting research on characterizing synthetic oscillator designs in E. coli. I’m a member of three different national honors societies: Tau Beta Pi, Phi Kappa Phi, and the National Society of Leadership and Success, as well as the Biomedical Engineering Society. My post-grad goal is to make an impact in biotechnology, while still treating learning as a lifelong endeavor. I spend most of my free time on Netflix, watching anime, reading good books, writing novels, and occasionally working out (not all at once though).
Alexis Caligiuri
I am am a recent graduate from UC Davis with a B.A. in Science and Technology Studies and a first year law student at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall. I completed my thesis for highest honors on interactions between speculative fiction and national security, and presented it at the ICFA conference in Florida last Spring. I was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa, and I served as the Chief Justice for the ASUCD Court in 2015. When I'm not critically investigating the relationships between science and society, I enjoy exploring cheeses from around the world, hula hooping, and watching (and rewatching) Star Trek.
Brent Weyers
I am a 5th year undergraduate student in Biomedical Engineering, graduating with my Bachelor of Science degree at the end of Fall Quarter 2016. I currently perform UG research with Dr. Tingrui Pan's Lab Group on microfluidics and quantitative biological assessments, I am on the UC Davis iGEM team, and I am working on a start-up company attempting to carry my senior capstone project forward beyond academia. I thoroughly enjoy research and I am applying for Ph.D. programs this Fall in Biomedical Engineering. In my free time, I enjoy running (both competitively and non-competitively) and triathalon activities.
