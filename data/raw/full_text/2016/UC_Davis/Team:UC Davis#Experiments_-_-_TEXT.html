Make the Gel:
Measure 0.5 g of agarose.
Add 50 mL of 1X TAE (Tris Base, Acetic Acid, EDTA) Buffer.
Microwave for ~1 minute or until agarose is melted.
Cool to ~45°C, or warm to the touch.
Add 3 μL of SYBR Safe gel stain (this is an intercalating dye that fluoresces when DNA is present) and mix well without producing bubbles.
Pour melted agarose into a gel mold with a comb in place.
Pop any lingering bubbles with a pipette tip.
Cure agarose gel at room temperature.
Run the Gel:
Stretch the piece of parafilm across one end of the 80-well tube rack. Make wells in the parafilm by pushing gently into the parafilm.
Pipette out 1.5 μL of the 6X loading dye for each of your wells.
Add 5 μL of your PCR reaction to each well and mix by gently pipetting up and down. (Make sure to keep track of which sample is which)
Add 5 μL of each sample into the gel. Ensure that there is at least one lane with 5 μL of ladder/standard.
Run the Gel at 120 V for 30 minutes.

While gently swirling to mix, add 7.5 µL of transforming DNA into the small pool of competent cells on the bottom of each correspondingly labeled tube.
Incubate the cells on ice for 15 mins.
Bring samples to the 42°C water bath. Heat shock for exactly 45 seconds.

Protein Purification Protocol
Goal: Purify the CBCR protein from cells
Expression
37degC → Shake 2-6 hours
24degC → Shake 12 - 25 hours
18degC → 16 - 36 hours
Transfer cells to 50mL Falcon and spin for 20-40min at max speed
Decant supernatent and store cells in -20
Initiate cultures in 50mL TB + Antibiotic (i.e. rich and buffered media) using an inoculum from an overnight or a fresh colony and shake at 37degC
Measure OD every 0.5-2 hours (i.e. take 100uL and add to 1mL) until OD reaches 1 (for blue… maybe higher for red?) in the culture (so would read 0.1 in instrument since there was a 10x dilution).
Add inducing agent and shake at defined temperature
Harvest cells
Lysis
Vortexing is fine, once resuspended keep on ice
Save 10uL for gel analysis!
Sonicate the cell suspension with 10 short burst of 10 sec followed by intervals of 30 sec for cooling. Keep the suspension at all times in water-ice bath. (Avoid foaming)
Remove cell debris by ultracentrifugation at 4°C for 30 min at 45 000 rpm using a 45Ti rotor
Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube-- this is your crude protein extract
Save 10uL for gel analysis before next step
Resuspend cells in 0.5mL of lysis buffer
Sonication
Purification
For every 1mL of culture, add 200uL of bead slurry (ie 20mL for every 1L culture) ~ for example 50mL culture = 1mL bead slurry
In a fresh 2mL tube aliquot bead slurry of chitin binding resin
Spin down at 1000rpm for 1min and pippette off ethanol supernatent
Resuspend in wash buffer
Spin down at 1000rpm for 1min and pippette off supernatent
Add Supernatent from lysis
Incubate on rocker in cold room for 2 hours
Spin down at 1000rpm for 1min and pippette off supernatent
Save supernatent as this is your flow through and will want to analyze on a gel
Resuspend in 1mL wash buffer
Transfer to a 50mL Falcon tube with 10mL of wash buffer
Incubate on rocker in cold room for 0.5 hours
Spin down at 1000rpm for 5min and decant/pippette off supernatent
Add 10mL of wash buffer
Incubate on rocker in cold room for 0.5 hours
Spin down at 1000rpm for 5min and decant/pippette off supernatent
Add 1mL of cleavege buffer
Transfer to 2mL tube & incubate overnight (16-24 hours) at room temperature (or potentially cold room… depends on stability of protein) on rocker
Spin down at 1000rpm for 1min
Transfer supernatent to fresh tube, this should be your protein!
Transfer Chitin resin to “USED” tube that is in 50% Ethanol at 4deg. Save until significant amount of material and then regenerate as described below.
Analyze Purified protein (Spectrum and SDS Protein Gels)
OPTIONAL: May need to concentrate and/or buffer exchange using a concentrator.
***GIVEN THE LOW BINDING CAPACITY OF THE COLUMN IT IS LIKELY YOU WILL NEED TO CONCENTRATE FOR WHAT WE ARE DOING*** Make sure to talk a lot of Wilson, Katie, Youtian in the Siegel group who do protein production and purification on an almost daily basis (show em this protocol as we generally use his beads with his tagged proteins which have a ~10x higher binding capacity).

Chitin binding resin re-use
Goal: clean bead of any previous protein so it can be used again
Take empty column and add10mL 0.3NaOH, 5 times at room temp.
Neutralize flow through NaOH with HCl
Allow to soak for 30 minutes
Repeat with 10mL water, 20 times
Repeat with 10mL wash buffer, 5 times
Continue to step 4 of above protocol
Storing the purified protein:
In the form straight from purification with 10% glycerol you need to freeze it using liquid nitrogen so that ice crystals don’t form and break the protein
Otherwise, you need to make it ⅔ glycerol/ volume so that you can store it in a -20C

Measuring Absorbance
Goal: Find dark state and photoproduct state absorbance
Turn on, and allow spectrometer to warm up for ~15min
Calibrate spectrometer with control solution of 50ul dialysis buffer
Put 50ul purified protein into plate well (3 reps each protein)
Take an absorbance spectrum ( 250-750nm - maybe try to narrow for more exact measurement once we know where it is)
Take a laser pointer and shine light on sample for at least 1 minute or until the entire sample changes color
Measure absorbance again (x3)
Wait until color is back to dark state, shine light on it again until all changed, start timer, and record how long it takes to revert back to dark state for a ~rough~ dark reversion time.
