iGEMMatch.org
We developed a website, iGEMmatch.org, which promotes collaborations between iGEM teams and makes contacting teams effortless. The website allowed users to sign-up, select which track their project fits in, give a short description and designate sortable keywords about their project. It not only allowed users to see what teams may have a compatible project, it provides the contact information so that teams no longer have to sort through university directories or relying on teams Wikis like other tools available. iGEMmatch had over 50 teams registered, 6 of which have official collaborations at the Jamboree, and promoted international collaborations that may have otherwise been unfeasible.
