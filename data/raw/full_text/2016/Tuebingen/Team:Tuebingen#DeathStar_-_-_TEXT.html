Idea and plan
iGEM has a lot of wet lab work concerning cloning of plasmids into bacteria. Therefore, our team decided to design a cloning robot, which gives significant reduction in time and manpower.
The robot is designed to perform a cloning cycle. Design thoughts included different possibilities in the movement of the pipetting head and an easy mobility of the whole device. The modular design of our robot secures the mobility of the device. A solution for the realisation of the pipetting heads was found in the new forms of 3D-printer heads.  We could make a concept model for our pipet robot, as you can see above. Unfortunately, due to difficulties in finding an appropriate working place we were not able to go on with our project and we could not realize our pipet robot.
