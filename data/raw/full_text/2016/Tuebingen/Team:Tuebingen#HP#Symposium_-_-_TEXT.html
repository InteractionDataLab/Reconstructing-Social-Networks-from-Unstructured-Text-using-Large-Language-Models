Sharing knowledge and receiving feedback
At the beginning of july the deanery and student association of molecular medicine in Tuebingen cooperated to hold a symposium titled "Degeneration and Regeneration - Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Concepts" in the university hospital Tuebingen. Invited were students of life sciences, molecular medicine and, thanks to our efforts, iGEM teams from all over Germany.
Because of its futuristic yet approachable nature iGEM is able to gather lots of attention
Master courses and PhD programs in several German cities were advertised and the iGEM teams presented their past or present projects with a focus upon projects with a possible medicinal application. We as iGEM Tuebingen used the opportunity to showcase iGEM in general and our 2014 and 2015 projects to the gathering. In discussions with the attendees we talked about our this year project and received a lot of valuable input concerning, for example legal matters of a genetically engineered probiotic, from attending professionals.
Intellectual exchange and receiving feedback is crucial in optimizing ones project
