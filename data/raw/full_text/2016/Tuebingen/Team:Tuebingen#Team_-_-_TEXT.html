This is our team consisting of 18 Bachelor and Master students from study subjects like Biochemistry, Biology, Bioinformatics, Molecular Medicine and Pharmacy. The wide range of study fields gives us the possibility to combine our expertise and the forming of expert groups. There was a weekly meeting of all expert groups to share experience with the team. The completion of skills lead to a good working atmosphere in the lab. Together we made the idea of our project come true.
