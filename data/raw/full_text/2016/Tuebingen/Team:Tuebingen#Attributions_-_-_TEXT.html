Every iGEM project is a team effort. Without anyone in the following list, this project would not have gotten to where it is now.
General Organisation
Brian Weidensee, Nikolas Layer, Daniela Nguyen and Katharina Sporbeck were responsible for the general organisation, starting by organising the weekly meetings to communicate with other teams and institutions.
Fruitforce
The idea for the this yearâ€™s main project was initiated by Mirjam Gneiting. The final project was then developed together with Brian Weidensee, Lukas Fuhs, Maximilian Bunz, Nikolas Layer and Yana Parfyonova. For the lab work, Stefan Petschak, Pascal Wang, Milena Krach and Simon Christmann reinforced the team.
Clone Wars
The Clone Wars project was developed and planned by Nicolai von Kuegelgen, Daniela Nguyen and Katharina Sporbeck.  The practical work in the wet lab was done by Stefan Petschak, supported by Milena Krach, Mirjam Gneiting, Pascal Wang and Stefanie Holz.
Death Star
The concept for our Death Star was developed by Mirjam Gneiting and Kevin Sabath.
Human Practices
Our human practices team consists of Jens Reich, Lucas Muehling and Sarah Roffeis. They organised participation at the meet-ups, organised our presentation in the Science Slam, and helped our high school intern to find around our lab.
Modelling/Wiki
All of the modelling was done by Adrian Geissler with the help of Alexander Roehl. The wiki design was done by Mirjam Gneiting, and Adrian Geissler transformed this into the code for the wiki.
Fundraising
Daniela Nguyen and Katharina Sporbeck were responsible for fundraising, building up and maintaining contact to companies.
