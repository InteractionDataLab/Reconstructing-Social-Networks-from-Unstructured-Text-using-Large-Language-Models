A composite part is a functional unit of DNA consisting of two or more basic parts assembled together. BBa_I13507 is an example of a composite part, consisting of an RBS, a protein coding region for a red fluorescent protein, and a terminator.
New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts (like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators, Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on).
Note
This page should list all the composite parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page.
