expand to 500ml and grow until OD600nm = 0.35
transfer into 50ml Falcon tubes
refrigerate centrifuge at 4°C, chill 2x 25mL 0.1M CaCl2 (Falcon tubes) and 5ml 0.1M CaCl2 with 10% Glycerol
spin down cells at 2,000g for 10min at 4°C
resuspend 5 Falcon cell pellets in 25mL ice cold 0.1M CaCl2
spin down at 2,000g for 10Min at 4°C
resuspend pellet in 2x5mL (=10mL) ice cold 0.1M CaCl2 with 10% Glycerol

DoubleDigest Restriction of gBlocks and BioBricks
2μl 10x buffer (corresponding to enzymes)
0,5μl restriction enzyme 1
0,5μl restriction enzyme 2
1μg DNA
fill up to 20μl with H2O
Method:
mix all components
incubate at 37°C for 2h
heatinactivate enzymes at 80°C for 10min or use for gel purification
Gelpurification
This is a modified protocol for the Wizard SV Gel and PCR CleanUp System Kit from Promega
Following electrophoresis, excise DNA band from gel and place gel slice in a 1,5ml microcentrifuge tube
Add 10μl Membrane Binding Solution per 10mg of gel slice. Vortex and incubate at 50-60°C until gel slice is completely dissolved
Insert SV Minicolumn into Collection Tube
Transfer dissolved gel mixture to the Minicolumn assembly. Incubate at room temp. for 1min
Centrifuge at 16,000xg for 1min. Discard flowthrough and reinsert Minicolumn into Collection tube
Add 700μl Membrane Wash Solution (ethanol added). Centrifuge at 16,000xg for 1min
Discard flowthrough and reinsert Minicolumn into Collection tube
Repeat this step with 500μl Membrane Wash Solution. Centrifuge at 16,000xg for 5min
Empty the Collection Tube and centrifuge the column assembly for 1,5min
Leave the tubes open for 10min (to let any rest of ethanol evaporate)
Carefully transfer the Minicolumn to a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube
Add 30μl of NucleaseFreeWater (65°C) to the Minicolumn. Incubate at room temperature for 10min
Centrifuge at 16,000xg for 1min.
Incubate sample at 65°C for 5min
Discard Minicolumn and store DNA at 4°C or 20°C
Ligation
1μl 10x ligase buffer
0,5μl ligase
1μl ATP
0,5μl linearised vector
7μl insert
Method:
Mix all components
Incubate overnight at 4°C
Purify using agarose gels
Smallscale plasmid preparation
Preparation was done using the PureYield™ Plasmid Miniprep System by Promega
Pick colonies for overnight cultures in 23ml LB medium with antibiotic grow overnight
Spin down 1,5ml bacteria at maximum speed for 30min, discard supernatant and add further 1.5ml, spin again and discard supernatant
Resuspend the bacteria pellet in 600μl H2O
Add 100 μl Cell Lysis Buffer, invert six times
Add 350 μl cold Neutralization Solution, mix thoroughly by inverting
Centrifuge 30s at maximum speed
Transfer supernatant to PureYield Minicolumn in collection tube
Centrifuge for 30s, discard the flow-through
Add 200 μl Endotoxin Removal Wash(ERB), centrifuge for 30s, discard the flow-through.
Add 400 μl Column Wash Solution(CWC), centrifuge for 30s, discard the flow-through.
Place column in eppendorf tube, add 30 μl Elution Buffer to minicolumn matrix, incubate for 1min
Centrifuge column for 30s at maximum speed, flow-through contains plasmid DNA
Measure the DNA concentration using a Nanodrop
