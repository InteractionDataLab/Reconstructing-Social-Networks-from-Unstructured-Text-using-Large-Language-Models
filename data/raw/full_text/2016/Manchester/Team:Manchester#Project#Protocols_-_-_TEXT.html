LB agar (Luria-Bertani agar)
If not using pre-mixed LB agar powder, prepare the materials as below:
In a 1L Erlenmeyer flask, swirl and mix the solution.
Cover the top of the flask with a lid/aluminum foil and label with autoclave tape.
Autoclave the liquid setting for 20 minutes or according to your autoclave's specifications.
After removing the solution from the autoclave, allow the agar solution to cool to 55°C in an oven or water bath.
When pouring the LB agar into plates, keep the bench area sterile by working near a flame or Bunsen burner.  Alternatively, prepare the plates in a vacuum hood.

Pour approximately 20mL of LB agar per 10cm polystyrene Petri dish.
Place the lids on the plates and allow them to cool for until the agar is solidified.
Label the bottom of plates with antibiotic and date before storing in plastic bags or sealed with Parafilm at 4°C.

Electrocompetent cells
Ingredients:
LB media
50% (w/v) glycerol solution
Before starting the procedure, be sure to:
Pre-chill centrifuge and cool rotor to 4°C
Pre-chill 1L of 10% (w/v) glycerol solution on ice
Pre-chill 500mL/1000mL Falcon tubes on ice
During the procedure:
Work under flame at all times.
Grow a 5mL overnight culture of cells in LB media.
In the morning, dilute this culture by at least 1/100 into a 50mL of fresh LB media in a 200mL conical flask.
Incubate them at 37°C.
Monitor growth of the cells every 30 minutes by measuring OD at 600nm (OD600) by filling up 750 µL of culture into cuvette.  Use LB medium as blank.
Once the cells are ready at OD600 = 0.4-0.6, harvest the cells to prepare for electroporation.
Place cultures on ice for 15 minutes.
All subsequent steps should be carried out at 4°C.
Cells should be kept on ice wherever possible.
Pour each 250mL culture into pre-chilled 500mL (or 1000mL) Falcon tubes.
Centrifuge at 5000rpm for 10 minutes.
Pour off the supernatant and aspirate any residual broth.
Add 250 mL of pre-chilled 10% (w/v) glycerol to each of the centrifuge bottles and completely suspend the cells by pipetting the solution up and down.
Centrifuge at 5000rpm for 10 minutes.
Pour off the supernatant.
Completely suspend the cells in 250mL glycerol and re-centrifuge at 5000rpm for 10 minutes.
Pour off the supernatant and suspend the cells in the residual glycerol by pipetting up and down.
At this point you can electroporate or freeze the cells away.  To freeze, add 100µL of the culture to microcentrifuge tubes on ice.
Once you have used all of the culture, transfer the tubes to dry ice for 10 minutes.
Once the cultures are frozen, transfer them to a -80°C freezer. The cultures should be good for more than 6 months.
Electroporation
Ingredients:
SOC medium
LB agar plates
Before starting the procedure, be sure to:
warm SOC medium to 37°C
Add 50µL of competent cells + 1 µL of DNA.  Mix well and place on ice for 5 minutes.
Transfer mix to 0.1cm electroporation cuvette (BioRad, #1652083)
Perform electroporation in a MicroPulse Electroporator (BioRad) using one pulse of 1.80 kV (EC1).
Measure the time constant (~5ms).
Add 950µL of pre-warmed SOC medium (37°C) to the cuvette immediately after electroporation.
Transfer to a fresh sterile 2mL tubes.
Incubate at 37°C for 2 hours.
Plate 50, 100, 200 µL (appropriate dilutions) and the rest of the cells (by centrifuging for 1 sec then decanting the liquid and resuspending with what is left in the tube) into LB agar plates using a plastic spreader.
Incubate at 37°C overnight (approximately 16-18 hours).
Look for transformants the next morning.
Take note of the dilutions made to use for colony calculations next day.

Chemical competent cells
Ingredients:
LB media
TSS buffer
Before starting the procedure, be sure to:
Pre-chill 1mL Eppendorf tubes
Pre-chill TSS buffer
Pre-chill Falcon tubes
During the procedure:
Work under flame at all times.
Grow a 5mL overnight culture of cells in LB media.
In the morning, dilute this culture by at least 1/100 into a 50mL of fresh LB media in a 200mL conical flask.
Incubate them at 37°C.
Monitor growth of the cells every 30 minutes by measuring OD at 600nm (OD600) by filling up 750 µL of culture into cuvette.  Use LB medium as blank.
Once the cells are ready at OD600 = 0.2-0.5, harvest the cells to prepare for chemical transformation.
Split the culture into 50mL Falcon tubes and incubate on ice for 10 minutes.
All subsequent steps should be carried out at 4°C.
Cells should be kept on ice wherever possible.
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm and 4°C.
Remove the supernatant. Pipette out any remaining media.
Re-suspend in pre-chilled TSS buffer. The volume of TSS to use is 10% of the culture volume (i.e 25mL culture = 2.5mL of TSS to be added) that you spun down.
You may need to vortex gently to fully re-suspend the culture, keep an eye out for small cell aggregates even after the pellet is completely off the wall.
Add 100µL aliquots to your chilled 1mL Eppendorf tubes and store at -80°C.

Tips and tricks for good gel electrophoresis results
Always have your gloves on and dispose ethidium bromide/SYBR Safe contaminated consumables accordingly - Safety first!
Choose the right gel buffer
Choose the right type of agarose (depending on desired gel strength, gel melting temperature and electroendosmosis)
Choose the right % of agarose
Ensure that the thickness of agarose gel does not exceed 5mm (recommended thickness = 3-4mm)
Ensure that sufficient DNA sample is added (3-100ng)
Choose the running voltage and time for agarose gel electrophoresis
Ensure that the DNA samples run in the right direction (-ve black end to +ve red end)
Choosing the right gel buffer
Choosing the right % of agarose
Amount of agarose to use depends on the DNA fragment size that you are expecting.

Casting a 1% agarose gel
Dissolve agarose with the desired gel buffer in a conical flask. Warm in the microwave for 1 min at maximum power.  Avoid bubble formation.
Swirl gently to cool it down.
Once cool, add SYBR Safe.
Prepare a casting tray with suitable comb depending on purposes and number of samples (wide for gel extraction or narrow for restriction digest).
Pour the mixture into the casting tray with a comb.

2-log ladder for 0.1-10kb samples; low MW ladder for 25-766bp samples
Run the gel at 100V for approximately 45 minutes.  Ensure that the gel is run from –ve (black) to +ve (red) end.
Fill the box with the same buffer used to dissolve the agarose powder.
Visualize an agarose gel containing DNA using a transilluminator.
While in the UV room:
Ensure that the door is locked.
Always wear gloves.
Adjust the sharpness and brightness to get a distinct image of the bands.
Save images using the pen drive without using gloves to prevent ethidium bromide/SYBR Safe contamination.
If the bands appear to be faint, soak the gel in ethidium bromide for approximately 30 minutes.
Re-visualize gel.

Mix thoroughly and incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature (or 20-30 minutes on ice).
The ligation reaction mixture can be used directly for the transformation or can be stored at -15°C to -25°C for later transformation.
For transformation, use no more than 1/10 of the ligation reaction mixture with the competent cells. Additional notes:
