Human Practices and Lab Integration
Any good model should not be an end in itself, but should be motivated by real questions and solve real problems. In our project, the questions we addressed were directly derived from our Human Practices work and our models helped to direct the experimental work in several important ways. The questions brought to us guided the construction of the model and the analysis of the results. The major areas of integration between modelling and the rest of the project were:
Question raised
Modelling Contribution
"What would be the best ratio of enzymes to obtain a robust response for the lowest possible cost?" (Raised in discussion with the Police and at the Microbiology Society Conference
Cost Analysis , examining predicted costs for a range  of different system designs with variations in the amount of enzymes based on experimental data
"How important are the specific parameters on the system?" (asked by the experimentalists)
Parameter Relationship Analysis , assessing the importance of specific parameters and combinations of parameters on the outcomes of the system
"Is the system we have assembled really functioning in the way we think it does?" (asked by the experimentalists)
Network Mechanism Analysis , comparing model predictions and experimental data for different potential circuit topologies
