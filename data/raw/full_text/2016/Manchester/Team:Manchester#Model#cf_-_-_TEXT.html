n some situations there are constraints that can be applied to the parameters to further improve your data set. One such example is the haldane relationship which relates kinetic parameters to equilibrium.
For our system we noticed the Kcat/Km ratio was reported so this was used.
A new pdf was generated, this time with all kinetic parameters consistent with the ratio.
Below you will find a figure showing the difference to the simulation using a filtered data set and a unfiltered data set.
In doing this kind of step you not only save computer time but also can provide a tighter prediction on what you would expect to observe if the model is accurate. <>
