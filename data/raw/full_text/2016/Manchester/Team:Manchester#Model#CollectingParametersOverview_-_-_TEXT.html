Collecting the Data
A short overview of the process involved in collecting the data required for Ensemble modelling.

All models are only ever as good as the quality of the initial data provided. Garbage In, Garbage Out applies heavily. Unfortunately there is much uncertainty in parameters measured in literature. Which parameter do you use? Which should you ignore?
GIGO DIAGRAM PALCEHOLDER
Uncertainty modelling can help account for this. 10 experimentally sourced parameters for 10 different papers will be much more representative that just a one. In an ideal world these would all be in the same conditions that your system will be however this is highly unlikely Our approach allows you to collect as much data as you can find on the system and accounts for all of it. Rather than picking a single value, or using the mean value from a few slightly different systems you instead should collect all relevant this data, regardless of temperature, pH, expression organism etc. The processing step will deal with the uncertainty, that the varied conditions introduces!
