Description
Part Type
BBa_K2092000
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2092000
AOx (without RBS)
This part encodes for the  AOx1 protein from Pichia pastoris. This enzyme oxidises primary alcohols to produce aldehydes and hydrogen peroxide. It is designed with an NdeI restriction site between the prefix and the start of the AOx gene.
Basic
BBa_K2092001
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2092001
alcR (without RBS/scar)
This part encodes for AlcR protein, an ethanol-activated transcriptional factor. It binds to alcA promoter and aldA promoter to induce expression of proteins in the presence of ethanol or threonine.
Basic
BBa_K2092002
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2092002
PalcA
This part contains the ethanol/alcR regulated  alcA promoter, the native variant of alcA promoter from Aspergillus nidulans which tightly regulates gene expression. It is an improved BioBrick from iGEM DTU-Denmark 2011
Basic
BBa_K2092003
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2092003
PalcA(var)
This part contains the ethanol/alcR regulated alcA promoter, an engineered variant of the alcA promoter from Aspergillus nidulans which tightly regulates gene expression.  The lack of one binding site on this promoter is suggested to have 70% decrease in promoter strength in comparison to the native PalcA .
Basic
BBa_K2092004
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2092004
alcR (incl. RBS)
This part is a twin of BBa_K2092001 with an additional RBS upstream of the start codon.  This part encodes for AlcR protein, an ethanol-activated transcriptional factor from Aspergillus nidulans. It binds to alcA and aldA promoters to induce expression of proteins in the presence of ethanol or threonine.

BBa_K2092006
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2092006
Pcon+RBS+amilCP
This part consists of a constitutive promoter , RBS and blue chromoprotein amilCP .  Suitable to be used as a reporter.
Composite
BBa_K2092008
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2092008
Pcon+RBS+alcR
This part consists of a constitutive promoter , RBS and alcR .  Suitable to be used to measure the promoter strengths of alcA /aldA.
Composite
BBa_K2092009
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2092009
PalcA(var)+RBS+amilCP
This part consists of PalcA(var) tagged with blue chromoprotein amilCP , which makes it capable to produce blue colour upon the binding of its ethanol-activated transcription factor AlcR .
