Hope to see all of you at our poster and project presentation at the Giant Jamboree 2016!
Experimentally validated and showed success on our key BioBricks: BBa_K2092003 , BBa_K2092004 , BBa_K2092008 and BBa_K2092009 .
Without the collaboration with other iGEM teams, our project would not have been successful. Thank you!
Reached out to various stakeholders, charities, public services and many others to make sure our device addresses real-world needs in a responsible and efficient way.
Integrated the investigated issues into the design of your project by modelling the cost analysis of the AlcoPatch and finding suitable alternatives for risk-posing substances used in this project.
Improved an existing BioBrick by adding two missing restriction sites â€“ XbaI and SpeI making assembly process easier.
Characterised previously existing BioBricks BBa_K1033930 and BBa_K1033925 .
Demonstrated a functional proof of concept of our project.
