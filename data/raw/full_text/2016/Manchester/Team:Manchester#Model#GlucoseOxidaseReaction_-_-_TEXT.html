Glucose Oxidase Reaction
Oxidation of glucose to Glucono-δ-lactone and Hydrogen Peroxide using Glucose Oxidase (EC 1.1.3.4)
Chemical Equation
$${Glucose} + {Oxygen} \rightleftharpoons {Glucano-} \delta {-lactone} + {Hydrogen} \ {Peroxide}$$
Rate Equation
$$\nu = \frac{K_{cat}[GOx] \frac{[Glucose]}{K_{m,Glucose}}\left({ 1- \frac{[Glucose]}{[H_2 O_2][{GDL}]} \frac{1}{K_{eq}}} \right)}{1+\frac{[Glucose]}{K_{m,Glucose}}+\frac{[H_2 O_2]}{K_{m,H_2 O_2}}+\frac{[H_2 O_2][GDL]}{K_{m,GDL}K_{m,H_2 O_2}}+\frac{[GLD]}{K_{m,GDL}}} $$

Parameter Sourcing
Kcat and Km parameters were collected from BRENDA
Keq was calculated using the Van’t Hoff equation using the Gibbs free energy sourced from MetaCyc
$$ K_{eq} = e^{\frac{-\Delta G} {RT}}$$
