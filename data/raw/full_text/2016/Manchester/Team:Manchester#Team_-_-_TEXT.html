Our team is very interdisciplinary: some of us are undergraduate students studying biology-related degrees and will lead the experimental research of this project. Others are studying engineering, physics and maths, and will be in-charge of the mathematical modelling that guides our experimental work in the lab. Our linguistics undergraduate on the team excels in outreach and human practice collaborations, making sure that our project meets real-world needs. The diversity of nationalities in the team is a unique characteristics of Manchester iGEM 2016!
Meet the team!!

Supervisors
Ross Kent
In 2015 Ross began a PhD at the University of Manchester in the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, where he works on post-transcriptional control of gene expression in bacteria. He is also interested in biosensing and multivariate Design of Experiments for the optimisation of synthetic metabolic pathways.
Ross graduated from the University of Exeter with a B.Sc. Hons in Biology in 2012, during which he gained work experience at Rothamsted Research. Following this he worked in the Exeter Microbial Biofuels Group, before beginning a M.Sc. by Research at the Shell Technology Centre in Houston, Texas in collaboration with Royal Dutch Shell. Here he worked on consolidated bioprocessing of waste material for biofuel production. Ross is an avid rock climber with a passion for the outdoors and travel.
Nick Weise
Nick gained a B.Sc. (Hons) Molecular Biology from The University of Manchester before completing a Ph.D. in Chemistry & Biochemistry at the University’s Centre of Excellence in Biocatalysis. He currently works at the Manchester of Institute of Biotechnology where he researches the discovery and engineering of enzymes for use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical synthesis. He is involved in teaching courses introductory and organic chemistry as well as in industrial biotechnology, whilst also coordinating the engagement and outreach initiatives of the institute. In his spare time he enjoys trampolining, gymnastics coaching and playing clarinet in the Manchester Wind Orchestra.
Marc Biarnes Carrera
Marc Biarnes Carrera studied at Universitat Ramon Llull (Institut Quimic de Sarria). He aquired his Degree in chemistry (speciality in organic synthesis). Marc worked at G.E.M. (Grup d'Enginyerina Molecular). He attained his Masters at the university of York (MRes in Post Genomic Biology). His Masters projects include work with Prof. Christof Baumann in the characterisation of HiGam proteins, and an industrial placement in GBL which involved improving bio fuel production through strain engineering. Marc is working towards his PHD, under the supervision of Prof. Eriko Takano, in the regulation of antibiotic production in Streptomyces. His project involves work with gamma butyrolactone, regulators of secondary metabolite production. He has currently begun his 3rd year of research. In the future he is considering research into synthetic biology as he finds the subject very appealing.
