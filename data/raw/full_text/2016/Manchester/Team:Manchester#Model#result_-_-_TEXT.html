Results
We had 3 main aims for our model: to introduce Ensemble Modelling to iGEM, to improve our understanding of our system, and hence the model, and to answer key questions that arose during the Human Practices. Below you can find the results of the latter two aims:
Network Mechanism Analysis
Parameter Relationship Analysis
Cost Analysis
Comparing model predictions with experimental data for different potential circuit topologies. read more
Assessing the interlinking nature of specific parameter pairings on the outcomes of the system. read more
Predicting the costs for a range of different system specifications by varying the amount of enzymes based on experimental data. read more
We found great inspiration from our human practices and guidance working both ways with the experiments. Click here to see a summary.
