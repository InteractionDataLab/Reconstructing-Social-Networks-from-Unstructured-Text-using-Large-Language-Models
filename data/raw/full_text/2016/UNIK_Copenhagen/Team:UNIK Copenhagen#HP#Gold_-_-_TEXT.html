As the prime example of how our investigations touched and affected our project, we have antibiotics. From an economic standpoint, our vision of space exploration is unlikely to be achieveable unless the cost and mass of our co-culture can be heavily reduced. Thus we chose to avoid the usual use of antibiotics, even though it would have made it more efficient.
This we know, amongst other sources, from Associate Professor Ole Nybroe that was also kind enough to supply us with the relevant strains of Bacillus Subtilis.
Likewise, from an ethical standpoint, the matter of resistance to antibiotics is embroiled in controversy. We sought to avoid it then, which was no easy task, to ensure viability and practical use of our co-culture both on Earth and the intended target of Mars and space.
Our presentation in Boston and our efforts to educate the public and initiate the developing dialogue has been greatly influenced, mostly by our training in public speaking, but also by all the experiences we achieved by going to Stockholm, Paris and Athens for the Nordic iGEM Conference, the European iGEM Meet-Up, and the AbGradE Symposium on Astrobiology. This is by far the least tangible way our project has been influenced, but suffice to say we have ended up with articles in more than 7 languages and have been invited to give a talk at the Giant Jamboree on how to host such events.
Another equally as important but somewhat cynical aspect is the matter of intellectual property rights. Before investigating the legislation, we did not consider what we did and didn’t say during presentations and published on papers and articles.
Our work with the Mars One Round 3 Candidate, Christian Ohlendorff Knudsen, has resulted in a “Manifest of Space Exploration” which has supplied us with streamlined arguments for our vision of going into space.
This is a fusion of both our practical, scientific arguments and his more emotional and ideological arguments. That we came together and formed this has strengthened the dedication of both parties, and has certainly helped us entice the public on this issue afterwards.
