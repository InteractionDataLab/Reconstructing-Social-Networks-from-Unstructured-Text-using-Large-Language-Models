Part collection
 
This part collection contain the BioBricks we have designed to produce the bioplastic P(LA-co-3HB) in the sporulating microorganism Bacillus subtilis. Besides, this collection also contain the genes that are necessary to produce the bioplastic polyhydroxybutyrate, simply do not add Lactate polymerizing enzyme to the organism of choice.
All of these BioBricks are optimized for usage in B. subtilis, and they can be used if a promoter is added in front of it. We can recommend using an inducible promoter such as Pgrac100 promoter that is induced by IPTG. Also, the operon will need a terminator - here we will recommend the α-amylase terminator from B. licheniformis.
