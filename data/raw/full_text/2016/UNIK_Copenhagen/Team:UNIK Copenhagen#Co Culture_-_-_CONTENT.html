They act a lot like roommates actually. When living together, you communicate, you interact, and you regularly affect the mood of your mate, for better and for worse.</P><P> </P><P>You cooperate with your roommate too, which is also the goal of our co-culture system; to make Synechococcus elongatus (henceforth “synechococcus”) produce the needed carbon source for a culture of Bacillus subtilis (henceforth “bacillus”) to grow, facilitating the production of a target compound by bacillus through cooperation.</P><P> </P><P>The target compound could potentially be anything in the biobrick registry, however, we have chosen to focus on usable compounds for space exploration and settlement. For this project specifically, we sought to facilitate the production of the bioplastic, poly-lactic-co-3-hydroxybutyrate acid (PLA), using novel biobricks within bacillus.</P><P> </P><P>-------------Figure 1: ”The provider: Synechococcus elongatus”----------------</P><P>In nature, Synechococcus is often found in well-lit marine environments. For CosmoCrops 2016 the strain PCC7942 of Synechococcus elongatus was used.

The strain used in CosmoCrops 2016 is B.subtillis 168.</P><P> </P><P>Why co-cultures suit space exploration better than monocultures.</P><P>Bioproduction generally offers a much needed method of production in space that could lower the requirements to spacecraft cargo, both in terms of diversity and volume, allowing for longer and more elaborate space mission. Basically, the more you can produce in space from extraterrestrial resources, the less you have to bring with you. For instance, bioproduction and synthetic biology could be used to produce fuel, medicine, plastic, food and nutritional supplements from very scarce or simple resources like sunlight and CO2. However, bioproduction comes with a cost, modern production facilities utilizing monocultures often require large and costly equipments which are simply impractical to bring along with you in space. Furthermore, one would have to bring several bioreactors to allow for continuous production.</P><P> </P><P>By utilizing two organisms instead of one, we envision that astronauts can use a single bioreactor to produce a plethora of useful end products, either in parallel or one after the other. The ultimate goal being to reduce the amount of tools a space pioneer would need to bring along with him or her to facilitate biological based production, and, at the same time, enabling space pioneers to produce any goods needed, when needed. We envision, a cartridge-based system where astronauts use a closed system of containers with the described compartments inside (Fig. 4), the compartments are made switchable to allow for easy extraction and change of manufacturer-strain.</P><P>----------”Cartridges”-----------</P><P>Figure 4: Closed system of two compartments for co-culturing in space.</P><P> </P><P>Providing a feedstock for bacillus - Making of the provider strain.</P><P>In principle, our co-culture design (fig. 3) relies on there being a “provider”, and a “manufacturer” that thrives in the feedstock/environment supplemented by biproducts of the provider’s metabolic activity. We utilized Synechococcus of the cyanobacteria phylum as a provider, because of its photosynthetic ability and tendency to accumulate sucrose in its intracellular environment in response to osmotic stress (REF 1).</P><P> </P><P>However, the bacteria lacks a way to export the sucrose to the surrounding media. To fully utilize the accumulated sucrose we therefore relied on previous research in rerouting metabolic carbon fluxes to the extracellular space. This work was done by Daniel Ducat at Harvard Medical school in the lab of Pamela Silver where PCC7942 was transformed with  the cscB sucrose/proton symporter from E.coli (REF 2). To accelerate our mission we utilized the original cscB-transformed PCC7942 strain with permission from the original authors.</P><P> </P><P>To validate the sucrose-exporting capabilities of transformed synechococcus and characterize a previously made biobrick inspired from Dr. Ducat’s research (BBa_K656011), the cscB-transformed PCC7942 was grown and induced to export sucrose by 150 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) with and without chloramphenicol (CAM) as measured by High-Throughput-Liquid-Chromatography (HPLC). Sucrose accumulated to maximum concentrations of … (Go to experiment).</P><P> </P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Validation / Characterization of BBa_K656011</P></TD><TD><P>Results</P></TD><TD><P>Link</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>Does the cscB transformed PCC7942 export sucrose?

An inner compartment made from a repurposed dialysis bag (2 kDa, Spectra/Por ® 6 dialysis membrane, 132633) contains bacillus producing a product. The outer compartment contain synechococcus secreting producing a carbon source for bacillus to live on. The dialysis bag serves both as mechanical separation and easy extraction of the product without cross contamination. Edited and reprinted with permission of Gert Gram and Jyllands-Posten.</P><P> </P><P>Enabling production from a common feedstock.</P><P>The choice of bacillus as “manufacturer” strain, was made taking into account its general resistance to extraterrestrial environments (ref - der var nogen der nævnte en artikel) and its ability to form hazard-resistant endospores (REF 5, ref 1). Endospores, at least theoretically, could be utilized to create a library of transformed  hibernating bacteria that upon addition of growth media can resurrect through germination, growing, and producing a wanted compound. We believe that such a system would make transportation less expensive, avoiding the need of cryogenic storage, and maybe more importantly, enabling the possibility of a closed system where astronauts could avoid contact with the bacterial cultures directly because all initial protocols are prepared on earth. Such closed system would be highly relevant to avoid contamination of the recycled atmosphere in extraterrestrial environments such as space stations, where opportunistic bacteria have been observed to thrive at the risk of the astronauts’ wellbeing (REF 2).</P><P> </P><P>Productive cooperation</P><P>Cooperation between roommates can sometimes be challenging, and for natural enemies such as two different bacterial species, it can seem almost impossible. Microorganisms are often involved in a battle of dominance fighting for space and nutrients in the confined space where they live. To reduce such competition, we repurposed a dialysis-bag to create two compartments mechanically separating the subcultures. Mind that the final goal would be to design cartridges to separate provider and manufacturer strains by dialysis membranes, but due to time constraints, device validation was based on a simpler model using a growth flask and an immediately available dialysis-membrane from Spectrum Labs (2 kDa, Spectra/Por ® 6 dialysis membrane, 132633)(fig 3). We utilized dextran blue, a polymer-based dye with a molecular weight of approximately 2 million Da, to characterize the integrity of our membranes. The membranes did not leak the dextran blue solution, and the dialysis-bag was therefore regarded as leak-proof (experiment 1). Furthermore, we tested our inoculation protocol in rich-medium(LB-medium) to characterize and optimize our sterilization steps. Our sterilization steps were successful, enabling us to isolate the inner compartment (inoculated with bacillus) from the outer compartment (not inoculated) (experiment 2).</P><P> </P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Validation</P></TD><TD><P>Results</P></TD><TD><P>Link</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>1) Was it possible to create a semi-permeable compartment by using a dialysis membrane?</P></TD><TD><P>Positive</P></TD><TD><P>Go to experiment</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>2) Was it possible to sterilize properly?</P></TD><TD><P>Positive</P></TD><TD><P>Go to experiment</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P> </P><P>Finding the right media composition</P><P>--- See protocol(LINK) tap for all media recipes ---</P><P>The first phase of the project was to determine a suitable media composition for bacillus growth. For that purpose, BG-11 was initially tested with or without added sucrose (experiment 1). BG-11 is a common minimal media for synechococcus and used in Ducat. et al. 2012 (REF 2). No growth was observed across all groups, which lead us to try other minimal media too. ATCC minimal medium, used for bacillus cultivation, was therefore tested as a suitable medium for bacillus growth, with or without 30 mM sucrose. From this we conclude that bacillus grows in sucrose-supplemented ATCC medium, and furthermore, undergo sporulation when sucrose is absent (experiment 2).</P><P> </P><P>A detail worth noticing is the fact, that Ducat. et al. 2012 (REF 2). Used 150 mM NaCl to induce sucrose accumulation in synechococcus. To investigate whether such osmotic stress would be harmful to bacillus in our co-culture, growth assays with 50, 100, 150, 200, and 500 mM supplemented NaCl were made to investigate whether the environment necessary for sucrose accumulation would inhibit bacillus growth. This suggested minor growth inhibition at 500 mM NaCl, but without major consequences at 200 mM and below (experiment 4). A similar growth experiment with synechococcus at different concentrations of NaCl was also undertaken, which indicated a lower growth rate at 200 mM and above (experiment 5).</P><P> </P><P>Because BG-11 media, which synechococcus is dependent on, could not be used for cultivating bacillus and given the positive results from ATCC grow measurements, we hypothesize that a mixture of ATCC and BG-11 in a 1:1 ratio could enable cultivation of both in a co-culture setting. To test this, bacillus and synechococcus growth on mixed media was investigated. The results suggested that bacillus could survive and grow in mixed media, however, the grow rate was slower compared to pure ATCC  (experiment 3), which is to be expected taking into account the negative results from experiments 1. Synechococcus was able to survive and grow as well, however, when IPTG was included to induce expression of cscB, a consistent and ponderous(HELP JOSEPH! I want to say significant, but I didn’t use statistics!)  drop in growth rate was observed across the cscB-transformed group, suggesting that sucrose export is growth limiting (which makes sense, if you take into account that cscB is rerouting carbon flux to the extracellular matrix) (experiment 6). For future research, it would be important to design a synechococcus strain that can sustainably export a carbon source and sustain its own population simultanously.  </P><P> </P><P>Device validation - Using spend media to simulate the co-culture environment</P><P>Finally, to make a convincing device validation we had to not only characterize our media, but also test whether it could work as a co-culture. We knew from previously described sucrose measurements, that cscB-transformed synechococcus were indeed able to increase the concentration of sucrose in the media, the spend BG-11 media would thus have a carbon source for bacillus to use, hence, we expect it to grow more. To validate, whether bacillus could grow in the final environment of our co-culture, spend medium (BG-11 + sucrose) was mixed with ATCC at a 1:1 ratio, 10 ug/ul chloramphenicol (CAM) was supplemented, and CAM-resistant bacillus was inoculated into the suspension culture. The growth measured in OD(600) was compared between spend medium from WT and cscB-transformed synechococcus (experiment 7). The results were positive, showing a clear increase in growth between uninduced transformed bacillus, IPTG induced transformed bacillus and WT. This implicates that our co-culture can be better than a monoculture under the same conditions, however, our project still lack an ability to measure an output/product, without which a direct estimation of cost-benefit between monocultures and co-cultures in space, is near impossible.  </P><P> </P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Experiment</P></TD><TD><P>Results</P></TD><TD><P>Link</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>1) Can bacillus grow in BG-11 media with and without sucrose supplement?

Furthermore, it enables the design of a sustainable and modular system of bioprocessing consisting of a producer (synechococcus) and a manufacturer (bacillus) that can be extended to produce multiple end-products in parallel with each other. We tested the ability of these specific bacteria, due to their photosynthetic capabilities and endospore formation of synechococcus and bacillus respectively. Bacillus could be grown in supplemented ATCC:BG-11 mixed medium, but at lower growth rates than supplemented ATCC media, and was very resistant to osmotic stress. Synechococcus could also be grown in mixed medium, however, did not tolerate high osmotic stresses and cscB-sucrose export as well as bacillus showing loss of growth rate in presence of IPTG and 150 nM NaCl. To validate our co-culture model, we used spend media of cscB-transformed and induced synechococcus to simulate the environment of the co-culture. From validation, we conclude that bacillus grow with higher rates in spend media - which should allow for a more productive bacillus culture compared to a monoculture in the same media without additional supplements.</P><P>References:</P><OL><LI>Martin Hagemann.
