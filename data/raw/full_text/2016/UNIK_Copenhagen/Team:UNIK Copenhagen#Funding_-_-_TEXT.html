Department of Plant and Environmental Scienes
The mission of the new department is to stimulate fundamental research and the synergy between basic and applied research in biology and environmental science. The focus is on plants, microorganisms, animals and the environment as a basis for sustainable production of food and other biological products. Research and teaching cover natural resources, agriculture, biotechnology and synthetic biology from the molecular level to the ecosystem scale.
University of Copenhagen, Common Foundation: To better the position of the University of Copenhagen as a institution of research and education.
With its more than 530 years, the University of Copenhagen is one of the oldest universities in Northern Europe. Being the largest institution of education and research in Denmark, the University has gone through numerous changes through the ages.
CPSC is a research centre at the University of Copenhagen. Research and education is conducted in the fields of plant biology and plant biotechnology.
The Center for Synthetic Biology is an crossdisciplinary research center at University of Copenhagen. Having pioneered synthetic biology as a major research focus in a European context, the Center today creates a framework for several major research initiatives that has sprung from the orginal UNIK Synthetic Biology initiative.
Lundbeckfonden is an active industrial foundation established in 1954. Its main objective is to maintain and expand the activities of the Lundbeck Group, and to provide funding for scientific research of the highest quality.
 
Additionally, the scholarship of Frederikke Lørup Mindelegat for students of physics at University of Copenhagen is entitled to our gratitude as well, for helping us making our interdisciplinary project possible.
