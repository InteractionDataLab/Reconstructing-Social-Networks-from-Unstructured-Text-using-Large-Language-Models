Proof of concept
Ultimately, no P(LA-co-3HB) was produced by our system.  However, the extensive media growth and sucrose secretion experiments demonstrated that the use of a shared medium was possible for both species and that the Synechococcus could be made to secrete the desired sucrose under correct salt and IPTG stimulation.
Furthermore, the design of the actual co-culture was demonstrated through experiments using dyes and live cultures to ensure no mixing of co-culture compartments occurred.  This eventually progressed to a live culture, though using wild-type Bacillus.
The gene PhaA was successfully integrated into B. subtilis, and have been deposited under the BioBrick identifiers: BBa_K1975002 .  The presence has been demonstrated with genotyping only. However, next step will check for the fluorescence tag and make an activity test to make sure that the protein is active.
