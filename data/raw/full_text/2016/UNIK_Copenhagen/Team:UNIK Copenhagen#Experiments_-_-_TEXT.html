Growth experiments
Materials needed
Liquid medium (In our case: LB, ATCC or BG11)
Inoculation loops
Plates with the respective organism (In our case: Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis or Synechococcus elongatus)
Falcon tubes or baffled flasks
Sterile bench
Spectrophotometer
Incubator (In our case: 37°C or 30°C)
 
Procedure
Step 1-3 and 5 is carried out in a sterile bench.
Pour medium into either a falcon tube or baffled flask, so it is one-third from its maximum volume
Inoculate the respective organism into the tube or flask using an inoculation loop that contains cells from the plate
Take 1mL out for OD measurements at 600nm or 730nm (The latter: only if it is S. elongatus) to find the cell density at time point zero
Incubate the tube or the baffled flask in the tested conditions. If falcon tubes are used, loosen the lid before incubation
Each day until satisfactory measure OD by taking 1mL out of the incubated tubes or flasks and measure OD at 600nm or 730nm (The  latter: only if it is S. elongatus).
Record the growth curve
