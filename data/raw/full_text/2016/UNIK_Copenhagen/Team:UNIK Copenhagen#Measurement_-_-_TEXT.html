Introduction
We are an interdisciplinary team fortunate enough to be able to borrow the Jens Martin Mars Chamber at the Niels Bohr Institute for Astrophysics, University of Copenhagen. This opportunity has created some pretty interesting setups characterizing our organisms for bioprocessing in outer space - which we of course had to find a way to measure.
 
Additionally, we used HPLC to characterize and validate sucrose export from cscB transformed PCC7942 exists as a BioBrick in the iGEM registry made by Stanford-Brown 2011 ( Bba_K65011 ).

Measuring sucrose with HPAEC-PAD
Sucrose is a disaccharide made from up of a unit of glucose and fructose with a glycosyl bond between them. To accurately measure it, we have applied Dionex- High-performance anion exchange chromatography - pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD). The amount of sucrose secreted in the media was determined using Dionex- High-performance anion exchange chromatography - pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) by using CarboPac SA10 (Thermo Scientific) column for fast separation of sugars.  HPAEC-PAD is an analytical device to detect and characterise simple to complex carbohydrates in the sample based on their electrocatalytic activity at high pH-level using NaOH. 200 µL of inoculated spinned media containing secreted sucrose was collected twice a day from the first day of induction for 7 days. The spent media was transferred to a HPAEC-PAD Vial (and septra) and the running program was consisted by a constant flow rate of 0,35 mL/min with the injection volume of 20 µL. More information can be found here , on the dedicated results page.
