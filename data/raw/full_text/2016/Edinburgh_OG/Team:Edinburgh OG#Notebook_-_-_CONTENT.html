                                    The team met with Jane Calvert to discuss the stakeholders in the project, including industry, research teams, other iGEM team and the public. The consideration of safety issues surrounding the use of heterologous parts in uncharacterised hosts and potentially unseen hazardous consequences sprang from this meeting and was expanded on throughout our project.</P></DIV></DIV></LI><LI class="timeline-inverted"><DIV class="timeline-panel"><DIV class="timeline-heading"><H4>May 9th-20th</H4><H4 class="subheading">First Weeks In The Lab</H4></DIV><DIV class="timeline-body"><P class="text-muted">Our first day in the lab, where we found our beloved starter kit. The following 2 weeks were focused on literature research, ordering of reagents and kits, lab preparation and finding sponsors for our project. The team also received an introduction to MoClo and training in Benchling, which we relied on heavily over the next few months. After receiving our safety forms the rhodococcus team started growing Rhodoccocus jostii on plates. The synechocystis team received the pPMQAK1 plasmid to be used for cloning in E. coli before transformation into Synechocystis. The team Fungi made initial cultures from a freeze dried sample and observed growth. Also the P444 plasmid arrived! Team MoClo received CIDAR MoClo plasmids from Laura Tuck.</P></DIV></DIV></LI><LI class="timeline-panel"><DIV class="timeline-panel"><DIV class="timeline-heading"><H4>May 23rd - June 3rd</H4><H4 class="subheading">Let The Experiments Begin</H4></DIV><DIV class="timeline-body"><P class="text-muted"> After much deliberation, we finally decided to use the Bba_ P10500 Phytobrick Universal Acceptor Vector as our destination vector for all (level 0) MoClo compatible DNA parts. The order for the synthesis of DNA gBlocks for our parts was placed through IDT.  The MoClo team finished their primer design for mutagenesis and began cloning plasmids for template. The fungi team designed and ordered primers to clone parts from the P444 plasmid with the new PhytoBrick standard by PCR.</P></DIV></DIV></LI><LI class="timeline-inverted"><DIV class="timeline-panel"><DIV class="timeline-heading"><H4>June 6th - June 17th</H4><H4 class="subheading">In The Swing of Things</H4></DIV><DIV class="timeline-body"><P class="text-muted"> Our first MoClo assembly was finally performed using DNA parts found in the CIDAR MoClo kit. However, very few colonies were obtained and therefore our MoClo reaction mixture and conditions were adapted.  Mutagenesis was conducted to remove illegal sites from the Rhodococcus vectors. Mut2 and Mut3 showed a good result. Our fungi team worked on their MoClo protocols in order to start assembling devices with our the designed PhytoBricks and achieved great efficiency at LV0. We also worked on optimisation of transformation protocol in P. roqueforti. Jane Calvert and Deborah Scott helped the group to delve deeper in to the social dimensions of the project and human practices, with discussion focused on new questions of patents, GMOs and ethics that powerful and enabling genetic technologies such as CRISPR/Cas have brought up. The first microorganisms for the CARE tool were chosen and its secondary metabolites retrieved. </P></DIV></DIV></LI><LI class="timeline-panel"><DIV class="timeline-panel"><DIV class="timeline-heading"><H4>June 20th - July 1st</H4><H4 class="subheading">Halfway There!</H4></DIV><DIV class="timeline-body"><P class="text-muted"> All of our designed parts were shipped to the lab and were then cloned into the PhytoBrick Universal Acceptor Vector.
                                       The fungi team designed multiple gBlocks fragments for synthesis of the AMA1 sequence that was to be assembled using a Gibson strategy.  Problems were encountered both with the transformation of P. roqueforti and the assembly of LV1 parts. The data mining for the CARE tool database began. </P></DIV></DIV></LI><LI class="timeline-inverted"><DIV class="timeline-panel"><DIV class="timeline-heading"><H4>July 7th - July 12th</H4><H4 class="subheading">Hotting Up In The Lab</H4></DIV><DIV class="timeline-body"><P class="text-muted"> We attended Synbiobeta Activate, a great and informative event that celebrated the official opening of the BBSRC-funded Edinburgh Genome Foundry - the first fully automated DNA assembly platform in the UK!
  Later in this week we also went to the Design Meets Synthetic Biology workshop at the Genome Foundry, where the limits of synthetic biology were discussed in reference to the the capability of the host organism or chassis. The MoClo team used Gibson assembly to successfully generate the level 1 MoClo vector for Rhodococcus.
                                       Meanwhile the fungi team faced troubles with initial attempts to assemble the AMA1 gBlock fragments. On a positive note, all other LV0 parts fungi parts were confirmed by sequencing.
                                       On a more positive note, Scotland experienced it’s one and only sunny day of the year!</P></DIV></DIV></LI><LI class="timeline-panel"><DIV class="timeline-panel"><DIV class="timeline-heading"><H4>July 18th - July 30th</H4><H4 class="subheading">Northern Meet-up</H4></DIV><DIV class="timeline-body"><P class="text-muted"> This week we co-hosted the iGEM Scotland and Northern England meet-up!

                                       LTeam MoClo demonstrated combinatorial assembly using parts library to show that our vectors are functional. Successful transformation of Rhodococcus was also demonstrated.
      During the last days in the lab the fungi team were busy adjusting several protocols to achieve a successful transformation of P. roqueforti and MoClo assembly of LV1 and LV2 devices.
