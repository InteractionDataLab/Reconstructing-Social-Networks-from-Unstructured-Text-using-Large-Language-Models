Results
Plate Reader
Figure 1 shows the standard curve for serial dilutions of FITC in the plate reader under the same conditions used to measure fluorescence in cells. The graphs was used to calibrated the equipment and convert from Fluorescence Intensity to molecules of GFP per cell.
Fig 1: Standard Curve of Fluorescence for serial dilutions of FITC
Conclusion
Results from the Plate Reader and Flow cytometer are consistent. Device 2 exhibits a larger number of cells but lower Fluorescence Intensity after 6 hour, in constrast, Device 1, which shows slow growth, has the highest Fluorescence Intensity. The lowest Intensity was detected in Device 3 using the plate reader, no fluorescence was detected in the flow cytometer.
Devices with stronger expression, exhibit a high degree of variation between treatments and replicates.
This study comfirms the promoter strength reported by Anderson Promoter Collection. Promoter J23101 is a strong promoter, J23106 is a medium strength promoter and J23117 is a weak promoter when they are expressed in E. coli
