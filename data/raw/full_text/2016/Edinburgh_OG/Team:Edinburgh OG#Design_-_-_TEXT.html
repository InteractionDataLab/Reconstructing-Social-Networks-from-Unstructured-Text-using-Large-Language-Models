Design of the Golden Gate Destination Vectors for Transformation in R. jostii
We designed a set of Golden Gate destination vectors based on the MoClo standard to enable quick and easy way to create constructs and transformed it to our new Chassis, Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. We chose to use pSRKBB vector (Schmidt-dannert, 2014), which was derived from pSRK21 (Vesely et al., 2003) as the base of these destination vectors. This plasmid contains Corynebacterium replicon (pSR1) and has been successfully transformed to R. erythropolis, a closely related species of R. jostii (Knoppová et al., 2007; Vesely et al., 2003; Archer & Sinskey, 1993). It has also been refined by the removal of illegal sites incompatible with BioBrick standard (Schmidt-dannert, 2014). We removed the illegal sites (BsaI and BbsI) and replace the cloning site of the plasmid with a standard BioBrick cloning site flanked by two verification primer binding site (VF2 and VR), enabling colony PCR for quick screening of insert, derived from pSB1C3. The resulting vector (pSRKM_Empty) can be used as the template to make Level-1 destination vectors by digestion and ligation of standardized LacZα reporter flanked by fusion sites as described in Iverson et al. (2016).
Fig1. (A) Physical map of pSRKBB-Empty showing pSR1 replicon as a black band. The replicon contains per (a positive effector of replication) and rep (replicase) gene. pK19 backbone (white band) contains pBR322 ORI and Kanamycin resistance gene (KmR) regulated by the P45 promoter. Mutagenic primer binding sites are shown as red arrows (mut1, mut2, mut3, and mut4). The region in the red box was replaced by (B) a BioBrick cloning site flanked by standard verification primer binding sites, VF2 and VR, derived from Iverson et al. (2016), creating pSRKM_Empty. Destination vectors can be made by digestion and ligation with SpeI to insert standardized LacZα flanked by the designated Type IIs restriction enzyme (recognition sites shown as bold) and four base overhangs for Level-1 (C) or Level-2 (D) assembly. (E) Schematic map of the level-1 destination vector pSRKM_NN and (F) the level-2 destination vector pSRCM_NN with chloramphenicol resistance (CmR). X refers to the fusion sites and NNNN to its four base overhangs: A (GGAG), B (TACT), C (AATG), D (AGGT), E (GCTT), F (CGCT), G (TGCC), and H (ACTA).

By talking about your design work on this page, there is one medal criterion that you can attempt to meet, and one award that you can apply for. If your team is going for a gold medal by building a functional prototype, you should tell us what you did on this page.
This is a prize for the team that has developed a synthetic biology product to solve a real world problem in the most elegant way. The students will have considered how well the product addresses the problem versus other potential solutions, how the product integrates or disrupts other products and processes, and how its lifecycle can more broadly impact our lives and environments in positive and negative ways.
If you are working on art and design as your main project, please join the art and design track. If you are integrating art and design into the core of your main project, please apply for the award by completing this page.
Teams who want to focus on art and design should be in the art and design special track. If you want to have a sub-project in this area, you should compete for this award.
