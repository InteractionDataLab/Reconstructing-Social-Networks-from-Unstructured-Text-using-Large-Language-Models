Human Practices
Summary
Our project encompasses the characterisation of standardized biological parts that facilitate the use of non-model microorganisms as novel chassis. The domestication of non-model strains with high potential for industrial applications could accelerate their understanding and increase the list of strains that are suitable for bioproduction of relevant products (Check out the team’s essay “Masses of Chassis” for more information).
Essay
However, we recognise that the integration of uncommon or new strains into the laboratory raises both biosafety and biosecurity questions (e.g. unknown pathogenicity and toxicity), which are heightened by the fast development of SynBIo and DIYBio fields. Such issues, if not properly addressed, can constitute a risk for both users and their surroundings  (i.e. unwanted health and environmental problems).
In order to contribute to current risk assessment procedures, and as a precautionary step for both experienced and non-experienced users, the Edinburgh OG team has worked on an accessible, easy-to-use program to evaluate the toxicity of curated secondary metabolites of both model and non-model organisms.
In the Silver section, the biosafety and biosecurity issues regarding our project are exposed along the description of current risk assessment practice.
In the Gold section, our “CARE” program is presented  along with its characteristics, feedback from other iGEM teams, limitations and further improvements.
Finally, in the Integrated Human Practices section, the main characteristics of the human practices’ of our project are highlighted.
