Synechocystis sp.
Cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 is one of the most extensively studied cyanobacterial species. Cyanobacteria constitute a unique class of microorganisms that are able to fix and metabolize carbon dioxide using the energy derived from sunlight. Nevertheless, the use of Synechocystis as a synthetic biology chassis awaits further investigation.Click on the icon above to find out more!
Rhodococcus jostii RHA1
The Gram positive bacterium Rhodococcus jostii are a metabolic marvels! They could degrade a wide range of toxic materials. They can even degrade polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)! These organism is very robust due to its unique genome content and its ability to create micro compartments. They are potential chassis for synthetic applications in bioremediation.

Penicillium roqueforti
The filamentous fungus Penicillium roqueforti is commonly used to make blue cheese. Fungi play an important role in the ecosystem due to their ability to degrade a wide range of organic matter. They are biotechnologically important for biotechnology industry to produce enzymes and complex secondary metabolites. The vast majority of fungal secondary metabolites await discovery, and the pool of fungal secondary metabolites is potential reservoir of drug leads and beneficial food additives.
