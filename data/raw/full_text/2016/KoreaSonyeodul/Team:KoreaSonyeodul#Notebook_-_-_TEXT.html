1st Experiment
4g of Styrofoam, three sub-experiments each have a control and experimental containers with 20 mealworms each:
Cool vs. Warm
Light vs. No Light
With other food vs. Just plastic

Team Meeting
Revise Plans, and further specify plans, but couldn’t work with DNA synthesis because the kit had not arrived.
Realizing our significant shortness of genetic knowledge. decided to host a mini-bio forum where we would read the Bio-tech chapter of the Campbell textbook and present

Meeting with Professor Cho
Before this official meeting, we only had communications throughout e-mails with our instructor, who is a synthetic biology professor in Korea University. In this meeting in the Korea University, we specified the experiments that we will conduct. Then, we planned the specific dates of experiment

Planning the experiment
Seunghee Han and Yemi Shin visited the Korea University to discuss about how we are going to further the experiment. At first our team put the main focus on enhancing the speed of degradation. However, after talking with professor Choi, we’ve decided to recombine the mealworm’s gut dna, DH5+alpha and PUC 19. We also scheduled our experiments

Chemical Transformation
We transfomed  E-coli, DH5-alpha using PUC19 in Korea University

Mealworm Related Measurements
After feeding 40 mealworms with only plastic for 5 weeks, we measured the length and the weight of the 20 samples. The average weight is 0.177g per worm and the original length is about 3+- 0.4cm. Compared to the original length 2+-0.2cm, it is noticeable that mealworms are possible to continue their lives with plastics as their only source of nutrient

Visited the Korea University to practice E-coli cell streaking. Did the three sector T streak. Organisms are streaked through the first sector using either a disposable loop or needle, or a reusable loop, usually with nichrome or platinum wire, and then passed through a Bunsen burner for sterilization
