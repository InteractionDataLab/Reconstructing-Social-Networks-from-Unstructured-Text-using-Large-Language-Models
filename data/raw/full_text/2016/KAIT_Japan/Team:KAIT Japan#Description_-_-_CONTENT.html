-Soil Conservation by Bacteria Cellulose-

A. xylinum is known as a type of bacteria which produces Bacteria Cellulose(BC).

Acetobacter intake glucose as sources of nutrient and produces Bacteria Cellulose by Cellulose Synthesis Pathway of Acetobacter.

Synthesis Pathway of Acetobacter

The pathway above is not only used to produce cellulose, but also used for other functions by glucose. Which causes the production of cellulose to be not so effective. So, we planned to diminish the amount of the enzymes G6PD and PGI. And to diminish the amount of the enzymes G6PD and PGI, we are using the method of antisense which will lead to deactivate of both the enzymes G6PD and PGI.

When antisense genes are expressed, an mRNA molecule is produced that is a mirror image of the targeted gene. The two, opposite mRNAs bind to one another, disrupting their function and making protein synthesis impossible. In effect, the targeted gene is blocked and transcription is prevented. Therefore, glucose will efficiently uses this pathway to produce cellulose which leads to increment of Bacteria Cellulose. And we think that, by using this modified gene, we can protect our environment as we can guarantee the humidity of soil to prevent desertification and soil erosion. 


-Suicide System-

We design this system with the goal to limit the prevalence of genetically modified organisms in nature as this genetically modified organism system is designed to scatter in nature. 

Suicide system designed

This system works when lactose is present, as placI works when lactose is present. And when placI works, it produce repressor that will binds with pλ. Therefore, K592024, I14044 and B0015 cannot be transcript. But, when lactose is absent, placI will be malfunctioned which leads to transcription failure of C0051 and B0015. And, pλwill works and transcript K592024, I14044, B0015. lacI will be produced and binds with placI.

However, as K592024 is a reporter gene, if it is not being reform, it cannot works as a suicide system. To let K592024 works as a suicide system, K592024 is changed to ccdB gene. If ccdB gene is being expressed, it proves that CcdB protein is being produced. CcdB protein works to inhibit DNA gyrase. That will leads to the commit suicide of bacteria.
