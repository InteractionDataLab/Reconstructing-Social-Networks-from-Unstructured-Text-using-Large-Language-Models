Experiment
To make this suicide system, we binds K592024, I14044 and J04450, and binds B0015, R0010 and J04450 together, and C0051, B0015 and J04450 together by using 3A Assembly.
However, we failed at the phase of ligation or transformation. Therefore, we change our plan to binding those parts one by one rather than using the method of 3A Assembly.
