Stop the desertification
The soil erosion and also the desertification which caused by the soil erosion have been an environmental issue, which attention is paid throughout the world. June 17 had been declared “World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought” to promote the awareness of this issue. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification had been implemented in those countries which are experiencing serious drought or desertification or both of it, especially in Africa. Hence, trying to solve this problem of desertification, our project focused on the Bacteria Cellulose produced by acetic acid bacteria, and we think that it can help to prevent the soil erosion.
