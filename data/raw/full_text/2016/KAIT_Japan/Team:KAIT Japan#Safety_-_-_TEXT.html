Q1.  What is our chassis organism?
A1．E.coli （DH-5α） and Acetobacter xylinum.
We use DH-5α for DNA cloning and we also use the E.coli as a model microorganisms to check the function of cloned DNA. We were going to transform A. xylinum. A. xylinum was used in an industry field and is normally present in the environment.
Q2.  What risks does our project pose at the laboratory stage? What actions are we takinｇ to reduce those  risks?
A2. ・We wear a lab coat and gloves when we use microorganisms.
・We have sterilized our used materials by autoclave, ethanol.
・We have experimented in clean bench to prevent our organism from escaping from lab.
・We sterilized all waste before we throw away.
・We have a P2 level laboratory and we use the room.
Q3. How would our project be used in the real world?
A3. Below is places that our project would be used in.
・Only in the lab
・In agriculture / on a farm
・In the natural environment
In this project, we don’t use our microorganisms in real world but in our lab. And, we try to give microorganisms the function that they commit suicide by sunlight.
Q4. What risks might our project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use? What future work might we do to reduce those risks?
A4. We try to give microorganisms the function that they commit suicide under the sunlight, but if the microorganisms doesn’t get sunlight, they may not die. So, in order to use this modified organism in the real world, we should find a better solution to improve this suicide system other than using sunlight.
