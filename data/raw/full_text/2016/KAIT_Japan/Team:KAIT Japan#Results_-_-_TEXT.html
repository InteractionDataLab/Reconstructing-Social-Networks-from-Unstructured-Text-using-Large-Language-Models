-Ability to produce Bacteria Cellulose -
Fig.1 Bacteria Cellulose (wet)
The figure above shows Bacteria Cellulose produced by Acetobacter. It is rich in water.
Fig.2 Bacteria Cellulose (dry)
To get the figure above, it is washed to rinse off the bacteria and nutrient medium. Then it is dried off as figure shown.
Fig.3 Sem image of Bacteria Cellulose
The dried off Bacteria Cellulose is then observed using Scanning Electron Microscope(SEM). The picture of Bacteria Cellulose taken during observation under (SEM) is shown above.
Three cultivation had been made, and the weight of the dried off Bacteria Cellulose is 0.0324g, 0.0327g and 0.0359g. therefore we get the average weight 0.0337g. Based on the results shown, if the enzymes G6PD and PGI can be deactivate by using the antisense method, we will get more than the amount of Bacteria Cellulose above.
-Suicide System-
To make this suicide system, we binds K592024, I14044 and J04450, and binds B0015, R0010 and J04450 together, and C0051, B0015 and J04450 together by using 3A Assembly.
However, we failed at the phase of ligation or transformation. Therefore, we change our plan to binding those parts one by one rather than using the method of 3A Assembly.
We succeeded in binding the parts K592024, I14044, B0015 and R0010. However, we failed at the phase of ligation or transformation which uses up most of our time. This causes lack of time to continue our experiment.
