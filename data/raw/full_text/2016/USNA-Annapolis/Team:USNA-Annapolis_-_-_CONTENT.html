Our goal of this project has two components. The first is to create a program to mathematically model both normal and conotoxin-affected intracellular ion concentrations. The second is to develop a signaling and responding pathway to detect changes in membrane potential and eliminate the conotoxins. </P></DIV><DIV class="team"><H2 style="text-align:center;">The USNA Team </H2><DIV style="width: 800px; height: 300px; margin-top: 40px;" class="bio"><P style="width: 800px; font-size: 1.2em; padding-top: 1em; position: relative; color: black;" class="bio-content"><B>Brian Pate</B></P><P style="float: right;">Dr. Pate is a Science &amp; Technology Manager at the Joint Science &amp; Technology Office for Chemical &amp; Biological Defense, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, serving as the agency’s lead for synthetic biology. He manages a portfolio focused on (1) interactions relevant to human effects of advanced and emerging weapons threats and (2) identifying and controlling new phenomena to enable breakthrough countermeasures to chemical and biological weapons. He is an adjunct faculty member at the University of Maryland and has recently served as an instructor in biochemistry and in weapons chemistry at Northern Virginia Community College and the U.S. Naval Academy, respectively. Dr. Pate earned a Ph.D. in Chemistry from Indiana University, followed by postdoctoral training at MIT in Materials Science &amp; Engineering. Prior to his current role, Dr. Pate was employed as a Visiting Scientist at the Air Force Research Laboratory, as a Senior Chemistry Specialist at Dow Chemical, and as a Lecturer in Physics, Chemistry, and Materials Science at Central Michigan University. Dr. Pate recently served as Deputy Director for Technology Watch and Horizon Scanning at the Office of Technical Intelligence, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and he maintains an active interest in using data-driven analytics to improve S&amp;T understanding, investments, and outcomes.
