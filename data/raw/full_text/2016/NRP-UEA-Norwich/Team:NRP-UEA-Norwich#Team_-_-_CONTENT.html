As well as being a science fanboy he has outside interests in mental health and philosophy. Working within the rapidly developing field of molecular biology has left him undecided on what he’d  specifically like to focus on, yet determined that he’ll find a worthwhile path to follow through further study. </DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="name">Jessica Meades</DIV><DIV class="position">BSc Biochemistry</DIV><DIV class="description">Jessica is a student at UEA studying Biochemistry. Since she started, she has always expressed an interest in both aspects of chemistry and biology. In particular, she has taken an interest in medical research, specifically cancer research. When Jessica is not in the lab, she enjoys painting, playing korfball and reading.</DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="name">Justinas Druskis</DIV><DIV class="position">BEng Computer Systems Engineering</DIV><DIV class="description">Justinas has been the go to guy when it came to technology. He is currently studying Computer Systems Engineering in the hopes of easing the struggles of day-to-day life. Justinas enjoys building new things, which is why programming is his outlet. Due to the fast-paced development in technology, Justinas is still unsure of his true interest. One of Justinas’ aspirations is to create an automated house which attunes itself to the tenants needs based upon their behaviour.</DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="name">Katie Stevens</DIV><DIV class="position">MSc Natural Sciences</DIV><DIV class="description">Katie is doing a MSc in Natural Sciences because she couldn’t narrow down her choices in the field of science. Natural sciences has given her flexibility to choose from all the nearly science modules at UEA making it the perfect compromise. Katie’s friends consider her a music snob, but she likes to contradict that statement as she just has amazing taste in music. </DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="name">Nancy Teng</DIV><DIV class="position">BSc Biomedical Science</DIV><DIV class="description">
Nancy is currently studying Biomedical Sciences at UEA. Originally, her plan was to study medicine but realised she is more interested in the why as opposed to what. The immune system is a particular interest and what Nancy hopes to focus on in the future. Outside of the lab she enjoys a game of volleyball and snapping some photos while out and about travelling.				</DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="name">Peter Frazer</DIV><DIV class="position">MSc Chemistry</DIV><DIV class="description">Peter is a student at the University of Leicester, however he lives in Norwich and kindly volunteered his summer to come help the NRP-UEA team. Peter studies chemistry, and expresses a particular interest in synthetic chemistry which includes organic and inorganic chemistry. When not in a lab coat, Peter enjoys playing volleyball and various other games.

Her interests range from biotechnology, genetics and science communication making this course and iGEM the perfect compromise to satisfy her never-ending curiosity. Outside the world of science she enjoys fundraising, watching movies, playing the piano, painting and travelling. 
				</DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="name">Sam Prudence</DIV><DIV class="position">BSc Molecular Biology &amp; Genetics</DIV><DIV class="description">Sam currently studies Molecular Biology and Genetics at UEA. His interest in molecular biology stems from the fact that it is one of the newest frontiers for modern biology, with vast amounts left to discover. Synthetic biology is a particular interest for him alongside evolutionary medicine, science communication and astrobiology to name a few. After graduating from UEA Sam intends to get his PhD. Additionally, he would do absolutely anything to get sent into space.				</DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="name">Tom Stirrop</DIV><DIV class="position">BSc Biological Sciences</DIV><DIV class="description">Tom is currently studying Biological Sciences at UEA. He has taken a particular interest in microbiology, genetics and science communication. His motive behind studying biology was to keep his interest broad, and in doing so keeping his options open in terms of a future career. A fun fact about Tom, someone once mistook him as Ed Sheeran on the train. Unfortunately, that is not one of his future aspirations. Instead, he hopes to go into the business side of the science industry.

His project focuses on developing new ways to transform solar energy into hydrogen and other valuable chemicals using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Outside of labs, Sam enjoys reading, playing piano and travelling whenever he can find the time. You can find Sam on twitter @samfrowe</DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="name">Jon Davis</DIV><DIV class="position">Electrochemistry Advisor</DIV><DIV class="description">Jon is a fourth year PhD student working on microbial electro-synthesis. He’s particularly interested in the production of simple metabolites like formate in Shewanlla oneidensis MR1. Jon is a qualified biochemist and focusses on proteins and enzyme kinetics. However, he does dabble a bit in molecular biology and electrochemistry when called upon. This leads to his project, which focuses on the potential sequestering of atmospheric carbon dioxide to provide a renewable energy source. When not in the lab, Jon enjoys learning various languages, reading and painting.</DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="name">Mike Norman</DIV><DIV class="position">Protein Expression Advisor</DIV><DIV class="description">Mike is currently going into his fourth year of his PhD. It’s centered around the topic of extracellular electron transport through the MtrCAB complex in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Mike considers himself a “RAF” brat, as he was born in Hong Kong. He enjoys travelling in order complete his scratch map. In his spare time, Mike likes to go for runs. Mike and Amy run an Instagram account (@TeaTimeSci) which focuses on the ‘fun’ side of a research project.
