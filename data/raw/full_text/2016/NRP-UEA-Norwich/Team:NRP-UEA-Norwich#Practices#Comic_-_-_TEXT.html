Comic Book
The comic book was created to make the science behind our project more understandable for a younger audience. We then used this at various events, such as open days and are planning to put the comic on display at the science festival in Norwich, which is more centred around children and families to help spark their interest in science. The idea of creating a short comic stems from the children that took park in the summer schools we helped, who didnâ€™t know what bacteria looked like or had a very limited understanding of why we needed to find renewable fuel sources, as well as the basic ideas behind our project. The prompted us to find a way of making this clearer to children, as well as fun, and we came to the conclusion that a Comic would be the best idea.     Our comic is available for download for free in PDF format by clicking on the link provided.
