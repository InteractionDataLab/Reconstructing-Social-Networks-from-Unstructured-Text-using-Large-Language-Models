Students
David Bryant
BSc Biology
David is a Biological Sciences student at UEA. As well as being a science fanboy he has outside interests in mental health and philosophy. Working within the rapidly developing field of molecular biology has left him undecided on what he’d  specifically like to focus on, yet determined that he’ll find a worthwhile path to follow through further study.
Jessica Meades
BSc Biochemistry
Jessica is a student at UEA studying Biochemistry. Since she started, she has always expressed an interest in both aspects of chemistry and biology. In particular, she has taken an interest in medical research, specifically cancer research. When Jessica is not in the lab, she enjoys painting, playing korfball and reading.
Justinas Druskis
BEng Computer Systems Engineering
Justinas has been the go to guy when it came to technology. He is currently studying Computer Systems Engineering in the hopes of easing the struggles of day-to-day life. Justinas enjoys building new things, which is why programming is his outlet. Due to the fast-paced development in technology, Justinas is still unsure of his true interest. One of Justinas’ aspirations is to create an automated house which attunes itself to the tenants needs based upon their behaviour.
Katie Stevens
MSc Natural Sciences
Katie is doing a MSc in Natural Sciences because she couldn’t narrow down her choices in the field of science. Natural sciences has given her flexibility to choose from all the nearly science modules at UEA making it the perfect compromise. Katie’s friends consider her a music snob, but she likes to contradict that statement as she just has amazing taste in music.
Nancy Teng
BSc Biomedical Science
Nancy is currently studying Biomedical Sciences at UEA. Originally, her plan was to study medicine but realised she is more interested in the why as opposed to what. The immune system is a particular interest and what Nancy hopes to focus on in the future. Outside of the lab she enjoys a game of volleyball and snapping some photos while out and about travelling.
Peter Frazer
MSc Chemistry
Peter is a student at the University of Leicester, however he lives in Norwich and kindly volunteered his summer to come help the NRP-UEA team. Peter studies chemistry, and expresses a particular interest in synthetic chemistry which includes organic and inorganic chemistry. When not in a lab coat, Peter enjoys playing volleyball and various other games.
Prarthna Barot
BSc Biological Sciences
Prarthna is currently taking Biological Sciences at UEA. Her interests range from biotechnology, genetics and science communication making this course and iGEM the perfect compromise to satisfy her never-ending curiosity. Outside the world of science she enjoys fundraising, watching movies, playing the piano, painting and travelling.
Sam Prudence
BSc Molecular Biology & Genetics
Sam currently studies Molecular Biology and Genetics at UEA. His interest in molecular biology stems from the fact that it is one of the newest frontiers for modern biology, with vast amounts left to discover. Synthetic biology is a particular interest for him alongside evolutionary medicine, science communication and astrobiology to name a few. After graduating from UEA Sam intends to get his PhD. Additionally, he would do absolutely anything to get sent into space.
Tom Stirrop
BSc Biological Sciences
Tom is currently studying Biological Sciences at UEA. He has taken a particular interest in microbiology, genetics and science communication. His motive behind studying biology was to keep his interest broad, and in doing so keeping his options open in terms of a future career. A fun fact about Tom, someone once mistook him as Ed Sheeran on the train. Unfortunately, that is not one of his future aspirations. Instead, he hopes to go into the business side of the science industry.
PhD Advisors
Sam Rowe
Chemistry Advisor
Sam is a third year PhD student in the Chemistry department at UEA. His project focuses on developing new ways to transform solar energy into hydrogen and other valuable chemicals using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Outside of labs, Sam enjoys reading, playing piano and travelling whenever he can find the time. You can find Sam on twitter @samfrowe
Jon Davis
Electrochemistry Advisor
Jon is a fourth year PhD student working on microbial electro-synthesis. He’s particularly interested in the production of simple metabolites like formate in Shewanlla oneidensis MR1. Jon is a qualified biochemist and focusses on proteins and enzyme kinetics. However, he does dabble a bit in molecular biology and electrochemistry when called upon. This leads to his project, which focuses on the potential sequestering of atmospheric carbon dioxide to provide a renewable energy source. When not in the lab, Jon enjoys learning various languages, reading and painting.
Mike Norman
Protein Expression Advisor
Mike is currently going into his fourth year of his PhD. It’s centered around the topic of extracellular electron transport through the MtrCAB complex in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Mike considers himself a “RAF” brat, as he was born in Hong Kong. He enjoys travelling in order complete his scratch map. In his spare time, Mike likes to go for runs. Mike and Amy run an Instagram account (@TeaTimeSci) which focuses on the ‘fun’ side of a research project. You can find Mike on LinkedIn: https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michaelnormanbiotech.
Amy Easey
Cloning Advisor
Amy is a third year PhD student, her focus is molecular biology with emphasis on synthetic biology and RNA ligases. Her interest in synthetic biology was sparked by her dissertation, which centered on Salmonella genes and carrying out DNA analysis of similar serovars. Amy is a registered biomedical scientist after completing her BSc at the University of Hertfordshire. Outside of labs, Amy enjoys going to festivals, on holidays and to the gym. Mike and Amy occasionally go on Pokémon hunts alongside managing their Instagram account @TeaTimeSci which aims to help with outreach and science communication.
