As part of the human outreach aspect of this project we designed an interactive website which was designed to target the general public and provide them with online lessons on synthetic biology. The lessons ranged from synthetic biology techniques, to applications and myths surrounding synthetic biology. The aim of this project was to get the public interested in synthetic biology and to increase understanding biology as a whole amongst the public. This project received interest and is currently being developed for use in secondary schools across the country.
