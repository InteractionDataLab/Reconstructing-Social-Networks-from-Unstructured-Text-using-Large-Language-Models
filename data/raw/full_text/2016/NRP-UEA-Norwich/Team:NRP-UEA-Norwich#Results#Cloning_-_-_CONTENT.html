			Cloning the FeFe and NiFe hydrogenase genes individually into pSB1C3, which can then be cloned into pBAD vector using Golden Gate Cloning (GGC).
		</P><DIV class="subTitle">Method</DIV>
			Basic cloning techniques were followed see respective protocols: PCR amplification, restriction digests and ligation into the BioBrick vectors i.e. pSB1C3. After successful ligations colonies were mini prepped and sent off for sequencing to confirm the sequence.  Individual genes (see table 1) were ligated into pSB1C3, BBa_J04450. Consequently, the genes were ligated together into our expression vector: pBAD via Golden Gate cloning.

			By analysing figure 1, it was confirmed that the genes were incorporated into the BioBrick backbone. <I>HydB</I> N-terminal was not subjected to colony PCR analysis. However, sequencing data confirmed correct ligation into pSB1C3, which was then used in Golden Gate cloning.

			The primers for golden gate sequencing were designed to ensure the correct order of parts when ligating into the pBAD vector. The reaction was set up using the corresponding protocol and the thermocycler used to cycle at the correct temperatures. The product was then immediately transformed into <I>α-select E.coli</I> competent cells purchased from Bioline. 

<A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich/GoldenGate">Golden Gate cloning </A> utilises type <I>IIS</I> instead of type <I>IIP</I> restriction enzymes. Type <I>IIS</I> restriction enzymes are those that recognise a DNA sequence outside of the cut site. This can be customised to be non-specific, allowing for custom overhangs. This means that during ligation between the inserts and their vector, the recognition site for these enzymes will be removed, eliminating the scarring that occurs during cloning with conventional restriction enzymes. These overhangs can be made to ligate consecutive inserts together. A primer was also designed that would guide the correct ligation of the inserts. The primer would be complementary to the consecutive gene inserts, restriction site and their <I>BsaI</I> cut-sites (Kirchmaier and Wittbrodt, 2013). For our experiment we needed the inserts to ligate as: <I>Fdh/HydC, HydA,</I> and <I>HydB</I> C-terminus or <I>Fdh/HydC, HydA</I> and <I>HydB</I> N-terminus. When ordering the gene inserts, the BioBrick pre- and suffix were included, as well as the Golden Gate sequences that would allow for scarless ligation.

Total size of both 8A5 and 9A5 is 7022bp, this includes the pBAD vector which is 4500bp. Gel electrophoresis with 1% agarose run at 110V for an hour. Ladder used was HyperLadder Kb. 
		</P><P>Successful transformations were observed. These were then used to  inoculate 10ml LB with kanamycin. Following overnight incubation, the samples were mini-prepped as described in the protocol, and sent for Sanger sequencing . An agarose gel was run with the successful constructs and the pBAD vector as a control, as there should be a difference in size if the ligations were successful (see Fig. 2)
