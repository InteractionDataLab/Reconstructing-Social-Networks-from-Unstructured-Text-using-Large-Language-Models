HUMAN PRACTICES
Forum Event â€“ The Norwich Science Festival
As part as our human practices we have obtained our own display area to promote IGEM and our project to a more general audience. This will take place at the Norwich science festival which will be held in the main atrium of the Forum in central Norwich. We will be explaining to the public the science behind our project and the pressing issue of renewable energy challenges that face the world today as well as the hot topic of the ethics that surround synthetic biology research.
One of the main attractions for our stall during the Norwich science festival will be our virtual reality experience to better engage the public in the world of synthetic biology. The VR experience will be available to anyone who wants to visualise what our bacteria, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, looks like as well a brief introduction on the protein complexes involved in our project. Anyone using the VR headset will be transported to the microscopic world of bacteria and gain a much clearer understanding of the science behind our project, such as following the path of an electron between the cell and its environment through the protein complex mtrCAB.

Additionally, we will be presenting our own comic book, designed by the BioWire team, to help our younger audiences see the bigger picture behind our project, being the global issue of climate change and our hunt for more efficient renewable fuels. The comic will also illustrate how bacteria can be engineered to do good and that not all bacteria is bad, as most children might believe.
