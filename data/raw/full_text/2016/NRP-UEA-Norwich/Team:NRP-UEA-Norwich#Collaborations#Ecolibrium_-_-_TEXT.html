Imperial iGEM 2016 are developing a piece of software to aid biologists in engineering co-cultures. For this they need optical density growth curves for as many different species of bacteria possible. As we are working with a different species of bacteria to most iGEM teams, Shewanella oneidensis, we are uniquely positioned to provide Imperial iGEM with some data to help them develop this ‘Ecolibrium’ co-culture engineering tool. Outside of this collaboration Imperial would not have the capability to add S. oneidensis growth curve data to their co-culture optimisation software.
To do this we ran 96 well plate OD readings of S. oneidensis growing in LB media and M72 media. These were incubated at 30°C, our bacteria’s optimum temperature, 33.5°C and 37°C (see figure 1 for an example of the data we produced). This way we can provide imperial with growth curve data on S. oneidensis at a range of temperatures between the optimum for S. oneidensis and the optimum for Escherichia coli, in two different kinds of growth media. LB being best for growth of S. oneidensis and E. coli in aerobic conditions and M72 being an optimised media for growth in anoxic conditions.
Figure 1: Growth of Shewanella oneidensis in a co-culture with E.coli. S.oneidensis and E.coli were co-cultured at temperatures at the optimum temperatures for the respective bacterias. The growths were also done in different medias that conferred optimum growth for the respective bacteria.
