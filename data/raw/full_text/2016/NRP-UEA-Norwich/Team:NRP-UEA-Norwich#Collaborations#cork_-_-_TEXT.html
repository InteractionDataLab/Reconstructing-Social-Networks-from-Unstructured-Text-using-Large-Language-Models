We collaborated with the UCC iGEM team to produce a video protocol to help other iGEM teams and high school teams to be able to use the biobricks to create paintings with bacteria, and run their own painting with bacteria summer schools. Both our teams had used Biobricks expressing different chromoproteins and fluorescent proteins in outreach activities as individual teams, but we had found it hard to find a protocol online. The recording was shared between UEA and UCC and organized over Skype meetings.  See below for the "what is cloning" molecular biology theory video we created for this project.
