All BioBricks consist of coding sequences for hydABC and hyaABC subunits for the FeFe & NiFe hydrogenase enzymes from Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. These were ligated into the pSB1C3 iGEM vector. All BioBricks samples have been tested for accuracy by DNA sequencing. All gene parts in these BioBricks originated from the organism Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and were submitted to the iGEM registry on the 19th of October.
