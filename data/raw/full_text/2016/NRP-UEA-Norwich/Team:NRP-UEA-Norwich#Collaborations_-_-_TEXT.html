Imperial College London- Ecolibrium
We were approached by ICL because our project chose to focus on S.oneidensis MR-1, instead of E.coli. ICL asked us to explore the effect of temperature on co-culturing two different species of bacteria. To read more about our co-culturing of S.oneidensis MR-1 and E.coli, please click on the image.

We wanted to explore the possibility of various anode materials, were our project to be applied on an industrial scale. One material worth exploring was graphite. After getting into contact we UKC, we travelled to their campus to use their state-of-the-art Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). In return, we proposed structures of their native vs. cleaved proteins.

While preparing for the Summer School we discovered that it was difficult to obtain adequate information about preparing for ‘painting with bacteria’. UCC faced the same obstacle and we decided to develop a fun collaborative video. This video would encompass how, we believe, would be the best way to prepare for a ‘painting’ with bacteria activity.

UK Meetup- Westminster iGEM
In August 2016 we attended the UK-iGEM meetup hosted by the 2016 Westminster team ‘BioLincs’. We presented a poster, gave a talk about our project and discussed iGEM and collaborations with the other British teams. We are grateful to the Westminster team for hosting this event and mediating collaborations with other teams.
