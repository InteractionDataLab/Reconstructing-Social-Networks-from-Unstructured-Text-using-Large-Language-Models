Virtual reality
During our discussions with companies in the energy industry we noticed it can be difficult to convey the concepts of molecular biology in an accurate and engaging way. To remedy this we developed a molecular VR experience, which places you inside the S. oneidensis bacterial cell and demonstrates a model of the system we have been working on in an immersive and exciting way. We displayed this at the Norwich science festival, UEA open day & at the iGEM Jamboree in Boston. Click the image for more details and a preview video.

Captain Shewanella a Comic
The comic book was created to make the science behind our project more accessible for a younger audience. We learned at the summer school that most kids have a very negative perception of bacteria. We created Captain Shewanella to show bacteria can be a force for good. This was displayed this at the UEA open day and at the Norwich science festival. Click to the image to read the comic.

Synthetic Biology Blog
Alongside our other projects involved with getting members of the public involved in science, we created a blog aimed more towards secondary school and sixth form students to try and encourage them to take on synthetic biology as their field of study. Click here to find more information and maybe a lesson or two on molecular biology.

Sainsbury Centre of the Visual Arts
We ran a practical session for kids ages 8-12 as a part of the ‘Exploring the Invisible’ theme of the SCVA Summer school. Amongst other activities we ran a painting with bacteria practical, a germ glow kit experiment and discussed the ethics of experimenting with bacteria. For more information click on the image.
