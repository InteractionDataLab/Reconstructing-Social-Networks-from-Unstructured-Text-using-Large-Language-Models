2016 iGEM Asia-Pacific  Conference
Time:2016.8.7-2016.8.17 Personnel: WANG XU, CHEN MINZE,LUO CHENGFENG, CHENG YINLIN,LI ANYI
In August, we joined the 2016 Asia Pacific Conference held by NCKU, which attracted almost 30 different iGEM teams from Chinese mainland and Taiwan. The whole conference simulated the process of iGEM Giant Jamboree which including presentation, poster time, discussing and other parts. Each team would do the presentation about their project in an independent classroom, and answered the questions that were put forward from both students and teachers. We made a communication with USTC, NYMU-Taipei, SUST and NCU. During the discussion, we made great relationship with them, especially with USTC.

After that both teachers and students asked some questions and showed their opinions about the project. During the conference, BIT had a chance to discuss with NUDT(National University of Defense Technology) because they had done some relevant experiment like our project before and we also exchanged the posters with SUST(Southern University of Science and Technology). Thanks a lot for the advice of teacher ZHANG HAOQIAN.
