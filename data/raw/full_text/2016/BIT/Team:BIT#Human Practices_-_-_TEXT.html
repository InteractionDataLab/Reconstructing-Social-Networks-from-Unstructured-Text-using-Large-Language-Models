Abstract
This year our project is about the early detection of breast cancer based on the factors miRNA155 and miRNA21. In the last six months, things we have done were as follow: make a questionnaire aimed at surveying the public perceptions for breast cancer; make a survey to get the information about the diagnosis condition of breast cancer; introduce iGEM and the project of our team in a college and a high school. Besides, we have built relationship with five teams and had a interactive communication with other two teams, and also joined two different communication meetings during the summer vacation, which we had got many appreciation and comments.
Questionnaire
This year we issued the questionnaire through the Internet, with both Chinese and English versions and got information after collecting them. The questions were centered on the personal health, physical examination, the understanding of breast cancer and the team’s products. It was distributed online in January and ended in March and we received 299 valid feedbacks.

Survey in Hospital
Time:2016.10.12
Personnel: Yang Wei, Xiao Wenrui, Chen Daoying, Li Rui, Chen Minze, Li Anyi
In the preliminary design work of practical part, team members communicated the ideas of project with Doctor. Cao Tianyu who has 20 years’ experience of clinical treatment of breast cancer. First he gave highly appreciation of the project and agreed with the fields of quickly and accurately detection of diseases. Then he explained the breast cancer through pathogenesis, treatment method and incidence trend and put forward the constructive suggestion to the market application of the project. In general, he thought the project would have great application prospect.
In October five members had a face-to-face communication with Dr. Cao in the office. The five members showed the project to Dr. Cao and introduce the method of determination in detail. After the communication he gave some useful advice not only in biological part but also for the hardware and software. In part of biology, the accuracy of detection should be improved and whether can the public accept the method of biological detection or not still remains a question. For part of hardware, the hardware needs to find its strengths and improve it in order to complete with the existing instruments like Microplate Reader. In addition, there will be a long time for the hardware to apply in the clinic field. As for part of software: the interface of application need to be more friendly to doctors who use it to communicate with patients.

On September 22, we had a preach in high school affiliated to BIT. The main content was to introduce Synthetic biology, let students know more about the emerging field of biological, present biological technology and also introduce something about iGEM. During the Q&A time the students asked many questions about the biological and synthetic biology and we believed that most of them had interests in this subject.

On September 23 we, together with BIT-CHINA held a session for the class of 2016 undergraduates in Beijing Institute of Technology. Because most of the students’ knowledge of biology was just stayed at the stage of high school, the whole session was on the basis of synthetic biology knowledge and then extended to the projects of two IGEM teams. Before the beginning of session, we distributed the leaflets which included brief introduction of our project to the students. The whole session lasted almost two hours and had great feedback.

The two sessions in different schools we not only introduced of our team’s project, but also the concept of synthetic biology to more people. We aimed to let more people who are full of ideas and innovation consciousness dare to fight with themselves and take part in this competition with their energy. During the Q&A time the students put forward many questions which help two teams to improve their project. Thanks for the support of teachers and students.
