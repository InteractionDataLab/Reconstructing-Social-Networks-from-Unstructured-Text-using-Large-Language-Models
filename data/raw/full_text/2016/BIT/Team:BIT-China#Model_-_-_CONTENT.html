                        Our system can work if we can prove the &quot;in-promoter&quot; will have different activities under different concentrations of inhibitor and the inhibitor can be used as a signal to sense the plasmid numbers. So we need to do two things to prove that our system could work. Our modeling part is aim at solving the two main problems to model the situation in the experiment and application.

At before, we think when the concentration of inhibitor is above 24.42 units, the in-promoter will be repressed fully. And then from this curve, we can see that when the concentration of inhibitor is 23.95 units are so similar with 24.42 units, the threshold of the plasmids number we calculate is 210 copies.

                                Here goes our conclusion: The number of the plasmids will determine the intensity of RFP. When the plasmids number is above the threshold 210 copies, <SPAN class="italic">rfp</SPAN> (stands for killer gene) will be just repressed, and the cells with enough plasmids number will be saved.

                                ①	The number of plasmids will have a positive influence on the corresponding inhibitor’s concentration.
                                ②	Since &quot;in-promoter&quot; will respond to the inhibitor with different concentrations differently, we can decide whether the killer gene express or not by changing the concentration of inhibitor.

                                To make a long story short, we successfully prove that the number of plasmids will affect the &quot;in-promoter's&quot; activity. By rudimentary calculation, we can say when the number of plasmid is above the threshold (210 copies), the inhibitor can just repress the expression of killer gene and the cell can survive. Once the plasmid number gets smaller, the inhibitor won’t work anymore, our P-SLACKiller time starts!
