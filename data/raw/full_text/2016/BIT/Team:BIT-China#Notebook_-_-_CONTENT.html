We use the 3A assembly to connect the gene circuits because the result of OE-PCR was always negative. The primer sequence was got from iGEM. But the design of restriction sites was not considered the protection base so that the restriction enzyme can not work efficiently. So we design the new primer with the consideration of the protection base and build our all gene circuit again. Luckily we get a positive gel result and we send the sample for DNA sequencing.
                                            But the result of sequencing shows that the device, araC-pBad-B0034-CI-B0015, has a base mutation in B0015. And the device, araC-pBad-B0034-tetR-b0015, has a base mutation in tetR so that it becomes termination codon. But the adviser suggests we continue to do the further test because there was something mistake in it probable. The LacIq was completely wrong. We have to build the gene circuit araC-pBad-B0034-LacIq-b0015 again. The results of pTac-B0032-RFP-B0015 and pR-B0032-RFP-B0015.

So we added a Chloramphenicol resistance Expression Cassettes into donor DNA, so after recombination, the right recon will have Chloramphenicol resistance and red look.But before we carry out a new plan, we plan to check competent cell, and make sure pkd46 was transferred into it. We extract plasmid from competent, the result of electrophoresis showed that no pkd46 in it, we decided to use new competent cell.

                                            We colon Chloramphenicol resistance Expression Cassettes from pkd3 and linked it with mRFP Expression Cassettes vie OEPCR,and recover the product of OEPCR;

                                            1. Now we were confused. Why always can't successfully transfer into the TOP 10 cell? Why did it grow up in the B plate but doesn’t have positive results?
                                           2. We thought about the above wassues, the only way to make it have Chl gene was transfer the PKD3 plasmids into the cell by mistake. In order to get the Chl gene, we use PCR technology to get it from PKD3 plasmids. So we make a verification experiment.
                                            3. We extract the plasmid from B plate, use it to be the complete for cat gene, and we succeed. And we also do electrophoresis to compare with PKD3 plasmid, we get the same stripe. It shows that the Chl gene was brought by PKD3. To solve this problem, we nitrify after we copy the whole snippet. It will eliminate plasmids.
