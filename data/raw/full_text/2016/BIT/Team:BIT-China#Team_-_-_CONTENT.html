                                        mystery and fun of biology, and I really enjoy the process of
                                        scientific research .The most amazing part of iGEM which attracts
                                        me is to use knowledge and experience I have by doing the things
                                        I love to create things that can make the world a better place.
                                        Besides experiments, I have a real passion for traveling around the world and
                                        tasting delicious food, because i believe either your body or soul must be on the way.

                                                        Major in biological. I feel honored to participate in the iGEM. I’m freshman for iGEM, I’m so happy to be an iGEMer. I love rising to the challenge, IGEM is a challenge for me. But I believe I can do it very well. Success calls for hard work and perseverance. I believe I can grow up and become a strong person in the future.

                                                        Hello everyone, my name is Yan Tai, who is the member of BIT-china. I come from Information and Electronic college and take charge of the management of alliance this year. Firstly, I so glad to get involved in the iGEM competition, this work gave me more deeply impression than itself, but in the communication with my team or the other team, which might have a big influence in my future. Besides, by this experience, I also made many new friends who were major on the different areas. They taught me a lot about my part, and I was so grateful of all the things.

                                                        My grandmother has said: “You will change the world in the future, my dear grandson.” So today, I am here and join the iGEM 2016 in order to make my grandmother’s dream come true. Save the world and protect all the human beings!
                                                        My Chinese name is Hu Pengjing; also, you can call my English name Beaz. I come from China. I like biology and soccer. If you also have the same dream, I will be together with you!
                                                        Synthetic biology gives us a chance to create all kinds of fungus with different superpowers. I don’t have the superpowers but I can give it to bacteria. So I believe that my super bacteria will help the human being one day.

                                                        Hello, everyone. I’m Pengcheng Zhang. It is my second year for IGEM. This year, as the leader of BIT-CHINA, I hope I can have a different experience. My major work are the wet and dry experiment.
                                                        IGEM is really a good chance to exercise ourselves, I do hope we could enjoy the special trip together. Also I want to do works more independently rather than just rely on team members like last year.

I am Jianfang Ren, a junior student from Yan’an University and major in bioscience. I haven’t learned about iGEM at all. This is my first year for iGEM. I am not the origin member and I join this big family in July. I have learned a lot from this project, and spent a good time in Beijing this summer vacation. I’m an active and friendly girl. Hope be your friend in Boston.

                                                        Hey, buddies, look here, the story told by Ziyin Zhang is about begin, from the mysterious ancient oriental country, China. With biological engineering professional skills, I crossed thousands of miles to the iGEM in order to create new energy and protect the world. I carried what I have and what you want. What I wish to emphasize here is that my story has unique plots of ups and downs and the enthralling end. If we're lucky to meet each other, I think you'll like it.

                                                        你好, I am Zeyan Li, enchantée！Hablo chino, inglés, español y un poco de francés. Haha~ you can call me Hamster because friends said I am really a hamster when eating biscuits. Two years of involvement in BIT-China iGEM team makes me a “housekeeper”, not only developing the research project with experiments but also doing design work to show the public our team. In my free time, I enjoy seeking all kinds of new food experience, except drinks with sugar:( By the way, the protein my favorite is our Killer Group’s hokD!

                                                        I’m Yiru Yang. I’m an undergraduate student from Beijing Institute of Technology, and my major is biology engineering. In order to achieve some useful purposes, I think that designing and constructing biological machines with synthetic biology knowledge is really very important and amazing. So this year I take part in iGEM to realize this idea, as a team member of BIT-China. I gain a lot in this process, for example, I learned how to design and how to do experiment well.
                                                        In a word, I’m so happy and grateful to be an iGEMer!

My motto is: All things we done will be paid off. Yes, in many situations, some things that seems to be unnecessary but may turn out to be useful and important one day.
