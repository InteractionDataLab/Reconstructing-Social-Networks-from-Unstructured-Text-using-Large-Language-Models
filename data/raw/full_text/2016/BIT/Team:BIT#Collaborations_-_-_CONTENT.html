1 USTC (Track: New Application)
</B></DIV><P>
During the communication meetings USTC and us got much advice from each other about the projects. After the communication USTC helped us to build the modeling, which let us solve the problems about the modeling. For more details please look at the part of modeling.

2 Toulouse_France (Track: Environment)
</B></DIV><P>
Team Toulouse from France aimed to promote IGEM and synthetic biology and filmed the video about the experiment of synthetic biology and also dubbing in different language for different countries all over the world. After receiving the cooperation request, our team member ZHOU CHUANGUI introduced three experiments with mandarin which helped Toulouse University completed the Chinese dubbing and promote the progress of their project.

3 SDSZ-China (Track: High School)
</B></DIV><P>
In April, iGEM Team of High School Affiliated Beijing Normal university, along with SDSZ_China’s members MA XINYI and SU HETIAN had a communication with team BIT in Beijing institute of technology school and visited the laboratory. Their team joined the competition for the first time this year and their project is about the detection of antibiotic which was relative to the project of BIT in 2013. The purpose of this communication was to explore the problems existing in the detection with the synthetic biology and exchange the views. A member of BIT, ZENG QINGQUAN detailed introduced the project and the captain YANG WEI answered the questions for SDSZ_China and was willing to try his best to help them in the experiment, captain YANG YUANZHAN also shared the experience about the iGEM. Wish them get a great success this year.

4 SCUT-China_B (Track: Therapeutics)
</B></DIV><P>
IGEM team of South China University of Technology, SCUT-CHINA_B gave a lot of help in the modeling. And member of BIT, YANG HAOKUN wrote a PC program for them because they always meet some calculation problems when they were doing the related experiments of cell infection. It gave them more convenience in biological experiments with the program and accelerated the progress of the experiment.
