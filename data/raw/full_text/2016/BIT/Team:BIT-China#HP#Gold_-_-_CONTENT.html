                                After the 2015 Giant Jamboree, team members of BIT-China cannot wait to share
                                their experience of participating in iGEM. With the coming of the cold winter,
                                <B>we came up with an idea to start a winter camp and light the fire</B>. Students
                                of different majors including life science and technology, electronic engineering, software,
                                art design and so on came to our publicity.

                                We invited our instructor Prof. Chun Li to give a general introduction about synthetic

                                biology and they wanted to know more
                                about the logic design and skills required to start a project.

                                Many of them wished to take systematic courses to have better understanding of the core concept about synthetic biology including “design, build and test”. They would like to not only gain more besides biology knowledge, but also extend to how to give a good presentation and how to integrate the mathematical equations into the iGEM project. Based on their needs, we prepared several lectures for eveyone may be interested in the skills required for iGEM competition, the speakers were our instructors and team members. Here are the topics:

                                We got many positive feedback from students. The overview of synthetic biology
                                let them know how broad the field is. And the training of software such as
                                Photoshop and Matlab shall facilitate their use of tools. It’s the beginning
                                of studying, not the end. They showed great interest in the concept of
                                standardization and the idea of engineering design. And we also invited
                                them to visit our labs. From preparation to implementation, the whole winter
                                camp lasted for <B>two months</B>. Then, we welcomed students
                                who showed great passion to iGEM to <B>take part in the brainstorm activity</B>.

                                What's more, our teacher, <SPAN class="italic">Prof</SPAN>. Chun Li,
                                introduced iGEM to students at Yan'an University. They wanted to set up
                                a team to participate in the iGEM, but they had never established any iGEM team and had no experience.

                                Therefore, we <B>invited three students from Yan'an University to be our team members</B> to design and
                                implement our project together. In this process, they not only expanded their knowledge of synthetic

                                biology and improve their experimental skills,
                                but also learned how to build an iGEM team.All those will help
                                them to establish an iGEM team next year on their own.

                                More importantly, we are closer to the idea of iGEM and spread synthetic
                                biology to more people.
                                We look forward to their outstanding performance next year.

                                    conference</B>held by team NCKU-Tainan. About 20 teams participated in the conference. All of them made splendid speeches to present their own projects and discuss with each other. During the special journey we got to know plenty of exciting ideas and got many useful help.

                                We also presented our project, and received lots of feedback to improve our

                                under hot discussion. The questions raised referred not only to the
                                project design, but also extended to considerations about safety issues.
                                However, since the logic order of our presentation was not clear enough,
                                the audience misunderstood the core concept of our project.

With this union, we also introduce the idea of iGEM competition, and what we gained in the challenging process to attract more people to participat in iGEM competition.

                                    practical problems</B>. For example, they talked about whether we can give an
                                artificial signal to indicate the plasmid lost and kill the bacteria.
                                In this way, they can reduce the cost of heat treatment to eliminate the
                                bacteria before the emission to the environment. Besides, they raised a
                                question about the distribution of inhibitor proteins as well as the plasmids.
                                The random distribution may also lead to the signal delay, which inspire hot
                                discussion among our team members. These considerations give us
