What makes our project a great one is                         not only the project itself, but also the engagement with public issues.
See our story.
Winter Camp
After the Giant Jamboree, team members of BIT-China cannot wait to share their experience                                 of participating in iGEM. With the coming                                 of the cold winter, we came up with an idea to start a winter camp and light the fire.
To promote the concept of synthetic biology, we invited our instructor Prof.                                 Chun Li to give a general introduction about synthetic biology and iGEM competition.                                 Students participated were very eager to ask some questions and share their ideas.                                 Some of them also showed their interest in participating in iGEM next year.
Communication & improvements
In August, 2016, BIT-China was invited to take part in the Asia-Pacific conference held by                                 team NCKU Tainan. About 20 teams participated in the conference, and all of them made splendid                                 speeches to present their own projects, from which we got to know plenty of exciting ideas.
In addition to this, we held and took part in several exchange                                 meetings with other three teams: Peking, Jilin_China , UCAS. Through these exchange meetings,                                 we got many useful suggestions to shape our project step by step.
HP Union
In the Asia-Pacific conference, we shared ideas with other teams.                                 Through this process, we all enlarged our horizons and improved our project greatly.                                 At the same time, we realized the importance of communication,                                 which facilitated the beginning of our HP union.
The main goal was that we could not only communicate with other teams more conveniently but also interacted with and got feedback from public easily.
To achieve our goal, we tried to build a Wechat official account to communicate with other teams and introduce teams’ project to the public.
We led the HP union and started the union with other five teams: BIT, CGU-Taiwan, Jilin_China , Peking, TJU. So far, more teams up to 10 are members of the union.
Communication with COFCO
In the end, we hope that our project can be applied and the target end users are companies focusing on fermentation industry. To get some suggestions for applying our project in industry production, we visited COFCO Nutrition and Health Research Institute.
The company’s manager said that plasmid instability was really a troublesome problem and affirmed our potential use in large-scale production.
What’s more, COFCO provided us with some financial help. They encouraged us                                 to polish our project and reminded                                 us of considering more about connecting our work with the realistic needs.
It’s not the end of our project
From winter camp, we firstly invited our instructor                                 to draw a map of synthetic biology and all of us shared our personal views about how we engaged ourselves into the competition and community. Younger students in our school from                                 different majors raised several questions and discussed with us.
At the brainstorming stage, team members proposed several ideas. We hold weekly meetings to discuss these ideas and assess the                                 feasibility as well as some design details. The miniature of our project was gradually formed.
Through communicating with other iGEM teams in Asia-Pacific conference                                 held by team NCKU Tainan, we shared our                                 ideas to more people and received some kind advice on how to improve our project.
During the talk with other iGEMers, many teams have the some confusion about how to start a human practice project and how to build the collaboration relationship with other teams.                                 That’s why we started the HP union and tried to gather teams which have same needs.
The visit to our end users opens a new door. We can just know the problem on                                 the paper from the literature research, while the dialogue with COFCO staff and their managers let us know how the problem we focused on will affect the fermentation production.
