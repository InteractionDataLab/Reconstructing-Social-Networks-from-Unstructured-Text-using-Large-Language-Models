Abstract
This year the project of BIT is about the alarm of breast cancer, based on early detection of the factors, miRNA155 and miRNA21. In the last six months, the work of human practice based on the project, made different kinds of activities. The activities about the practice including:
1.Making a questionnaire aims at surveying the public perceptions for breast cancer;
2.In the hospital we have a survey in order to get the information about the diagnosis condition of breast cancer;
3.Introducing IGEM and the project of our team in a conference held in the college and a high school.
Besides,Team BIT builds relationship with 5 teams and has a interactive communication with other 2 teams, and joined two different communication meetings during the summer vacation, getting many appreciation and comments.
Questionnaire
In order to make more people know team’s project, the meaning of iGEM and get some feedback from different persons about their opinions to breast caner. This year Team BIT issues an questionnaire through the Internet, with both Chinese and English versions and gets information after collecting the questionnaire. The questions are centered on the personal health, physical examination, the understanding of breast cancer and the team’s products. The questionnaire was distributed online in March 2016, ended in October 2016 and received 299 valid feedback which are very helpful for the progress of project.
Because the questionnaire was spread to the public and more than half of persons investigated have not heard about iGEM and synthetic biology before. It’s a normal phenomenon existing in the public and it’s important to make more people know iGEM and synthetic biology.
-Q29.Do you know about Synthetic biology?*
A.YES
B.NO
Promote iGEM and synthetic biology in Schools
Place:The affiliated high school of Beijing Institute of technology

On September 22, team BIT had a preach in the affiliated high school of Beijing Institute of technology. The main content was the introduction of Synthetic biology which was in order to let students know more about the emerging field of biological and the present biological technology and also introduced something of IGEM. During the Q&A time the classmates asked many questions about the biological and synthetic biology and believed that most of them had interests in this subject.

On September 23 Team BIT together with BIT-CHINA held a session for the class of 2016 undergraduates in Beijing Institute of Technology. Because most of the students’ knowledge of biology was just stayed in the stage of high school, the whole session was on the basis of synthetic biology knowledge and then extended to the projects of two IGEM teams. Before the beginning of session, Team BIT had distributed the leaflets which included brief introduction of our project to the students. The whole session lasted almost two hours and had great feedback.
Promote iGEM and synthetic biology in Schools
The two sessions in different school for high school students and undergraduates are not only an introduction of team’s project, but also introduce the concept of synthetic biology to more people, make more persons who are full of ideas and innovation consciousness, dare to fight with themselves and take part in this competition with their energy. During the Q&A time the classmates put forward many questions which help two teams to improve their project, Thanks for the support of teachers and classmates.

In August, Team BIT joined the 2016 Asia Pacific Conference held by NCKU, which attracted almost 30 different IGEM teams from The Chinese mainland and Taiwan. The whole conference simulated the process of iGEM Giant Jamboree which including Presentation, Poster, Discussing and other parts. Each team would do the presentation about their project in an independent classroom, and answered the questions that were put forward from both students and teachers. BIT made a communication with USTC,NYMU-Taipei,SUSTech and NCU.Because the discussing with each other, BIT made great relationship with them, especially had a cooperation with USTC.
This conference provides a platform to share ideas with different teams and promote iGEM to more and more people. At the last day the NCKU prepared testimonials and souvenirs for all the teams that attend the conference. The participants got not only precious advice, but also the friendship with each other. After the conference, members of BIT also joined the trip of Taiwan, enjoyed many famous sights. Thanks for the careful arrangement from NCKU!

SYSU Central China iGEM Consortium
Time:2016.9.3-2016.9.7
Personnel:YANG WEI,CHEN DAOYING,LUO CHENGFENG,YANG HAOKUN, ZHOU MUGEN, ZENG QINGQUAN,LI ANYI
With the improved project, BIT took part in the CCiC (Central China iGEM Consortium) held by SYSU, aimed at advertising different projects through the presentation and poster-time. After that both teachers and students would ask some questions and show their opinions about the project. During the conference, BIT had a chance to discuss with NUDT(National University of Defense Technology) because they had done some relevant experiment like our project before and BIT also exchanged the posters with SUSTech_Shenzhen. Thanks a lot for the Teacher ZHANG HAOQIAN’s advice.
