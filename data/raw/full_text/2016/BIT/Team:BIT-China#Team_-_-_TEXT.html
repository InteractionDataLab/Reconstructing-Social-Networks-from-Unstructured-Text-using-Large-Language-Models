Hi, I am Xiaopeng Gao from Beijing Institute of Technology. As an advisor                                                 of BIT-China, I have given a lot of proposals to our program which is just                                                 like our baby. What’s more, I have devoted myself to this                                                 program and pinned great hope on it.
My major is biochemical engineering and the field of my research is                                                 metabolic engineering and synthetic biology,                                                 so iGEM is a rare chance for me to use my major strength to solve practical problems.
After year-long preparation, I have been head over                                                 heels in love with our program and harvested a lot. I really appreciate iGEM.

Hi. It's my first year to be an iGEMer. I am so honor to join this team and gain a lot of precious experience in this project. To be honest, this is the most amazing summer that I ever have.
I am that kind of people who adore drawing and handcraft, because it can make me like an awesome person. If you also a big fan of drawing and handcraft, we can talk more about it.
Let us enjoin this giant jamboree.
Hui Luo
Hi~ I’m Hui Luo. This is my second year to attend IGEM competition. A lot of challenges and funny things come together to my life. I’m fascinated about science and technology. IGEM gives me a great opportunity to touch my dream science and have a unique experience to intensively work on a project with my lovely teammates.
Actually, I’d love to become a well-rounded person, which means I can not only understand the scientific books but also know how to arrange my daily life. I’m not good at these kinds of things, but I’m trying to make efforts.
Lianjie Ma
Hi, dear. I’m Lianjie Ma. It’s my first year for iGEM. I do hope we can be good friends.
I belong to very typical slow person, but that won’t be the blocks between you and me. If you are interested in Korean teleplay or losing weight (smile bitterly), come to find me at BIT-China.
I can hardly wait to see you in Boston!
Kang Ma
Kang is named by my father, which in Chinese, means never give up and stay positive.
This is my first year to be an IGEMer. Changing the DNA of bacterial and making them work for us is the coolest thing I have ever done.
In my spare time, I play ping-pong and basketball, I like songs of Birdy and Ed sheeran. But now, more than anything, I want to go home and have dinner with my families.
Lirong Zhao
I major in chemical industry. Loving science, loving nature, loving biology, loving international technology, and loving iGEM, these features combine into me.
In our team, I am a new member and responsible for experiment and wiki, also learn a lot through the whole process.
People can only see the outward gorgeousness but the inward rough. Chasing dream is doomed to be a lonely journey, there will always be challenge and ridicule throughout the way. Even covered with wounds and cuts, we still should live beautiful for our own. Be chillax, and be graceful, remember we finally speak for ourselves.
