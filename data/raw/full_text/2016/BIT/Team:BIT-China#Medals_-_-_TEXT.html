Document at least one new standard BioBrick part or device. For example, [BBa_K2120008]. click here to view our all parts.
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device works as expected.
For example, We have validated [BBa_K2120002], [BBa_K2120003], [BBa_K2120004], [BBa_K2120005], [BBa_K2120006], [BBa_K2120302], [BBa_K2120309], [BBa_K2120310], [BBa_K2120311], and the other 8 parts                                 For more details, click here.
Helped any registered iGEM team in a significant way.
We have been mentoring a high school team CIEI-BJ and collaborated with team Jilin. See our collaboration page.
Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of social issues in the context of your project.
See our human practice page for communication details with COFCO company.
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
See our HP/gold page for feedback and advice from COFCO company to our project.
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry.
We have mutated the promoter pTet and improve the function of [BBa_R0040] by creating promoters with different responsive strengths.Also, we've completed the verification results of [BBa_K302033] and [BBa_K1497008] .
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project.
See our proof page for measuring the lethal efficiency of toxin proteins mazF and hokD.
Show your project work under real-world condition.
See our results page for successful simulation of plasmid concentration with inducers added. The functional device consists of the expression cassette of inhibitor proteins and RFP.
