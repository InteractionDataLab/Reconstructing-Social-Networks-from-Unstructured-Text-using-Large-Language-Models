Programmable and open-source Next Generation Bio-Chip (NGBC) based on cell-free system
READ MORE â†“
Programmable
Give bio-chip different functions by re-construct immobilized genetic circuits.
Cell-Free
Bio-safety, low noise and more possibilities.
Open-Source
Distribute technology around the world.
Short Prototyping Time
Build a new bio-chip just with in a week.
One-Step & High-Throughput
Complete all the reactions on one bio-chip and test for multiple samples together.
Ultra-High Expression
U-HEC (Utra-High Expression Cassette) enables high protein expression on the bio-chip.
Unlimited Potentials
It is possible to testing for everything by construct proper genetic circuits.
Project Abstract
NGBC --- Next Generation Bio-Chip, is what we are going to create. This will be the first bio-chip ever that allows user with knowledge in synthetic biology to easily re-program and re-construct it in order to make new bio-chips with different functions.
NGBC use genetic circuits to process the input signals and given output results. In order to minimize the disruptions and limitations of biochemical reactions inside a living-cell, the reaction center of NGBC will use S30 cell-free system which is produced from cell extracts and could provide all the conditions required for biochemical reactions like that inside a real living-cell. What is most amazing is that the complete genetic circuits and cell-free system is just carried by simple filter paper and no other expensive materials required to construct it. We are also developing a hardware and a software which can be integrated with NGBC to provide a more accurate data readout and a more interactive user environment.
In future, we intended to develop a completely open-source NGBC kit which contains all the necessary materials, protocols and genetic components required to re-program the BioChip, and the kit will be distributed to labs around the world so there will be more new BioChips with different functions be developed. We will also create an NGBC clinical database that includes all the verified BioChips which are able to measure the concentration of target clinical molecules such as glucose, nitrate and fatty-acids in the clinical sample with in a certain range.

Project description
We are going to design the first programmable BioChip ever by using genetic boolean logic gates(Piro et al, 2013) which enable the BioChip to achieve complex tasks. Several other amazing features like cell-free expression system and ultra-high expression cassette(U-HEC) are also introduced...

Proof of concept
In order to prove the feasibility of our idea, we constructed a simple plasmid with a pH inducible promoter with EGFP coding sequence in the downstream of the promoter. We immobilized this plasmid onto our bio-chip system and tested for the RFU value in comparison with a standard constitutive J23119 promoter ...

Collaborations
We got a lot through our iGEM journey, and one of the best and most valuable among them was our cooperation with other iGEM team. In this win-win process, we exchanged our ideas, inspired creativity, and even helped each other to run experiments...
