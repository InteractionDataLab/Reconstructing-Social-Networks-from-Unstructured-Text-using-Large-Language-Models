Joseph had contributed his tremendously sophisticated skills in arts by designing the team’s T-shirt and a large variety of artistic tasks.
Philip Huang 黄秋霖 Huang Qiulin
Hi, I was an A2 student of Shenzhen College of International Education when I participated in iGEM BGIC team. My job involves project designing, plasmids engineering, wet lab, wiki construction and 3D-model building. I mainly interested in synthetic biology and genomics.
Lillian 王雨枫 Wang Yufeng
Lillian（Wang Yufeng) is one of our lab work team members. She is involved in the production of plasmids and data collection.
Eloise Qiu 邱彦慈 QiuYanci
She is Eloise she is 16 years-old she is a current A1 student in SCIE
“From spending my entire summer living next door to our lab and working more than 12 hours a day (╯°□°）╯i realised that i still have a lot more to learn in order to explore the great potential of synthetic biology and Its a lot more difficult in practice than it is in theory. !!!! iGEM allowed me to meet some amazing people I never would have otherwise. ”
Flame Yenution熊寅宇 Xiong Yinyu
Hi, I am Xiong Yinyu. You can also call me Flame, which is my English name. I must note that it is my first time to take part in iGem. Even though I am good in my biology studying, it quite surprisesme by this competition. After then, I know more about the real scientific research.
In our team, I usually work for designing primer and plasmids as well as making these plasmids. I don't think I did it well this time. However, next year will be better!
The optimistic and hard work character pump me to continue to work in the iGem competition after facing much more faults.
Absolutely, I love it and will join iGem again in the future.

She is a student form Shenzhen Middle School. By accident, she got a chance to join in the BGI group. The aim she came to this group is just for interest, and in fact, sometimes she doesn’t know what she will do in the future. Since the students don’t have much time to do modern biological experiments in school if they do not get extra application, most of her parts in team are in the laboratory, for the plasmid.
Although there is not so much time besides study, she did as much as time permits.
