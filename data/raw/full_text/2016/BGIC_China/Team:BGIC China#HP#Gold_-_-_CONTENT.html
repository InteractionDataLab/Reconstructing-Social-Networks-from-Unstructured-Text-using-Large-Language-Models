This is our iGEM group project and we have work on this for a few month. The idea is to produce a test paper system that can be used to detect and measure the concentration of small biological molecules i.e glucose, that can be then used in further analysis. Where the innovation is we are trying to build a re-programmable and open-sourcing systems, that simply every biologist can get use to it quickly.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="s-block-item s-repeatable-item s-block-sortable-item " data-reactid="93"><SPAN data-reactid="94"><DIV data-reactid="95"><DIV class="s-block-item-inner clearfix" style="position:relative;" data-reactid="96"><DIV class=" columns sixteen" data-reactid="97"><DIV class="s-component s-text" data-reactid="98"><DIV class="s-component-content s-font-body" data-reactid="99"><P style="font-size: 130%;">I am so glad to be a participant in LIYSF 2016 Science Bazaar, where different, innovative and exciting ideas get opportunities to be spread and exchanged. I met a guy from University of Oxford who brought his group’s iGEM project to the bazaar, where we get a chance to communicate and know each other. Now we are friends on Facebook and we do talk synthetic biology a lot. There are also many other brilliant projects that not necessarily related to synthetic biology. One I remembered was about ‘sewage treatment’, the participants from Indonesia were trying to design an algae that had been modified to purify sewage. Another one is about ‘reinvented fans’. It is absolutely fabulous to see peers from 75 different countries bringing their projects, and some of them might be the ‘sleeping dragon’ that one day will wake up and change the world!</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="s-block-item s-repeatable-item s-block-sortable-item " data-reactid="168"><SPAN data-reactid="169"><DIV data-reactid="170"><DIV class="s-block-item-inner clearfix" style="position:relative;" data-reactid="171"><DIV class=" columns sixteen" data-reactid="172"><DIV class="s-component s-text" data-reactid="173"><DIV class="s-component-content s-font-body" data-reactid="174"><P style="font-size: 130%;"><EM><STRONG>The BGIC Summer camp</STRONG></EM></P><P style="font-size: 130%;">Starting from late May, we, the BGIC, had set ﬁve summer camp sessions on Synthetic Biology, each of length one week during which the basis of Synthetic Biology was taught to high school students of moderate knowledge in this ﬁeld. Apart from theory, wet lab training was also in the session, including basic laboratory skills in terms of super clean bench operations and all the other basic techniques in a Synthetic Biology laboratory. During this process, the attenders of the camp were given a basic knowledge of Synthetic Biology as a whole, and were taught basic wet lab techniques. These invoked their interest in the subject and one of them, Michael Lu, out of outstanding performance, was invited into our team and contributed immensely afterwards.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="s-block-item s-repeatable-item s-block-sortable-item " data-reactid="175"><SPAN data-reactid="176"><DIV data-reactid="177"><DIV class="s-block-item-inner clearfix" style="position:relative;" data-reactid="178"><DIV class=" columns sixteen" data-reactid="179"><DIV class="s-component s-text" data-reactid="180"><DIV class="s-component-content s-font-body" data-reactid="181"><P style="font-size: 130%;"><EM><STRONG>Collaboration with Shenzhen University and Shenzhen Middle School</STRONG></EM></P><P style="font-size: 130%;">Joint hands with the Shenzhen Middle school, we had accomplished—— The Fab 12 Fair During the prestigious Fab 12 Fair in August 2016, we had the privilege of encountering an inspiring model, the Foldscope.

This inspired us in a ways that once our biological chip is into the market, we could propose a batch-selling with the fold scope and have users observe the results of the test papers through the foldscope.
