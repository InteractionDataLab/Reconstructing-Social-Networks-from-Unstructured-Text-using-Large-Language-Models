Applied design  Having acknowledged that any authorized personnel is able to re-design our Next Generation Biology Chip by assembling the promoter targeting at the intended molecule of onto our sensor plasmid backbone. That is, this open-source platform can virtually sense the presence of any molecule should the promoter that can be activated by such molecule is able to be found. The portability of the biology chip gives it immense storage convenience, and, maintained temperature of four degrees Celsius, it could be stored with upmost convenience and remains functionable for 360 days. This user-friendliness also gives rise to the number of aspects that the chi- can be utilized. For example, the water sample testing in covert area in the presence of advanced equipments
