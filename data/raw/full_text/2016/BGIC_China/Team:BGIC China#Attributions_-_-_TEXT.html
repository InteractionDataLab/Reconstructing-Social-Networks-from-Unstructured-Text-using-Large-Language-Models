iGEM Crowd Funding, August 2016
In an attempt to improve the status of our cash flow, a crowdfunding program was put into action in August 2016, lasting a one-week period. The program was issued on an online platform in Beijing. In informative overview of the project and an introduction of the competition were produced. Well- organised repaying scheme was drawn whereas gifts represented by team postcards, T-shirts and sequencing service were emailed to donors in a gesture of gratitude. Just on the second day, a surprising amount of finance, 19,000 RMB were collected, an equivalence of $2,819, meeting the goal. The support from the wide range of individuals represented by friends, families teachers and schoolmates of the team members reflected, to an extent of significance, the public awareness built up by our endeavours of human practice over the months.
