COMPOSITE PART

Basic Part →
One essential part in designing new BioBricks is the characterization and thus the estimation of the resources consumed by that BioBrick. For that reason, we wanted to genomically integrate a GFP coding gene into the genome of E.coli For the measurement of the metabolic burden caused by a BioBrick one can transform the cells with that BioBrick. After inducing said BioBrick one can estimate the metabolic Burden by the decrease in constitutively expressed GFP. To make this kind of measurement possible we assembled this BioBrick, which is composed of the λ‑attp‑Site, a J23101 Promoter from the Anderson Promoter Series, a RBS and a coded GFP with an added LVA‑Tag and two bidirectional terminators. The two key parts of this Brick are the λ‑attp‑Site, which is necessary for the genomic integration of the Plasmid. The integration follows the λ‑bacteriophage integration mechanism combining the attachment site plasmid (attP) with the attachment site bacteria (attB). The second part is the constitutively expressed GFP with an LVA‑Tag which makes the measurement of the metabolic burden possible and easily achievable. For introducing an easy and reliable method for measuring the metabolic burden caused by different BioBricks we think that this part is worthy of being awarded the price for the Best Composite Part.
