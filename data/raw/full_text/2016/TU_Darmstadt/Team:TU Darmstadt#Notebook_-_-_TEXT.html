For half a year we were working in the wet lab  
  , developed a pipetting robot  
and simulated the molecular dynamics of our proteins  
  . As well we would like to highlight certain social events  
which helped us to further improve our team spirit.
Our iGEM year started with weekly team meetings on tuesdays in January.
On February 27 and  28 we officially iniated the project with our Kickoff-Event in which teams have been formed and weekly teamleader meetings were set.
To teach the new members all the needed basics for working in the lab and genetic engineering in general, the experienced students offered classes like a snapgene workshop (March 4), how to use scifinder (March 12) and a cloning strategies  workshop (March 17).
