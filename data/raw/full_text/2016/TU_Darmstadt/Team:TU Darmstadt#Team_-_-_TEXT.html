It’s a pleasure to see your local iGEM team grow over the years. As a former student member, I try to pass gathered experiences in the competition on to the next generations of iGEM’ers. This year’s project uses the best of this competition’s ideas: expanding and improving the toolbox of iGEM, using new ideas, based on well-characterized old parts. But not only the scientific processes of researching and creating are exciting for me, the challenge of forming a functioning team out of students who rarely know each other beforehand is one of my favourite parts of the iGEM project.

Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 4
So far I am studying biology in the fourth semster and still I am very satisfied with my decision. As I covered the basics now, I have the chance to follow my interests to gather experiences in the laboratory. This is what I expect from the iGEM-Project.  Working in a team as well as having the ability to develop my own ideas is what motivates me to enhance my knowledge in addition to my regular studies.
Thomas Dohmen

Semester: 2
It is the second time I am taking part in the iGEM competition and I am looking forward to learn and work with a bunch of exciting people. Unlike last time, my main task will be the work in our modelling department and therefore I will unfortunately just have a small amount of time for laboratory work. I am also hoping to pass on the knowledge I gathered in 2014 to our new team members.

I’m partaking in iGEM this year because I want to expand my knowledge about gene editing and molecular biology as well as practical work in the lab. Independant working and sense of responsibility are my priorities fort he project. It is the first year of iGEM for me and I'm looking forward to learning from the old and new members.
Katharina Geißler
Studies: M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 1
Hey, I study Biomolecular Engineering in my first Master semester. I am new to iGEM, but highly motivated to carry out our very own synthetic biology project with students from our and other disciplines. I am very happy that I joined this year’s team since we already had a great time together and probably will have during the rest of the iGEM year!
Alana Stephanie Gouveia
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 4
When I first heard of iGEM I knew I had to be part of it, I've got flattered about the idea on learning and working with student colleagues in a whole independent way which students are used to in the college routine. I'm very optimistic and excited about our project, the whole team is in syntony and ready to help each other. So far I had only good experiences. I know how much knowledge this project will bring us all and this is for me the biggest reason to dedicate and push myself to the most professional I can get.
Franziska Hameister
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering

Semester: 4
This year I am joining the iGEM Team of the TU Darmstadt for the first time. I look forward to gain many new experiences and getting to know people from different places. The most interesting part about iGEM is the work in a team without anybody, who tells you what to do. Therefore we have to deal with upcoming problems and the right solutions on our own. By this way of “Learning by doing” I am convinced to remember the methods and processes easier. Moreover I am happy about the iGEM community, meetings with different iGEM team and some travels, because next to the working periods should always be some free time for socializing.
Claudia Kreher
Studies: M.Sc. Biology
Semester: 3
My motivation to join the iGEM team is to learn how to plan and perform a project by my own or in a group with other students. I also hope to learn how to analyse problems in the lab work and find alternative solution approaches. Furthermore I hope to find new friends and have a nice time with them besides the work in the lab.
Milana Kremenovic
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 4
I´m fascinated by the iGem-Team`s performances of the last years and thus I´m glad to learn from the more experienced team-members.  The learning effect is my biggest motivation. It´s amazing how big the learning progress can be, when you have to make concepts, search for solutions and work in the lab on your own.
Yannick Kristiansen
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 4
Working together in a group, having fun and achieving a mutual set goal is what fascinates me about the iGEM Project. And in addition to that, there are many new things to learn, especially laboratoric techniques which are another major point for joining the team. Overall I hope for much fun and new experiences during the project.

My participation at iGEM last year has been the most educational and enjoyable experience of my entire study years. That’s why, naturally, I would love to participate a second time. I’m looking forward to the lab work and a great time!
Tim Maier
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 4.
This is my first time, that I am in the iGEM-Team. Last year I was fascinated by the ideas and their realizations of the ‚iGEM-Students’. Already back then I was sure, I wanted to participate this year.  Within the iGEM-project everybody has the opportunity to develop not only in terms of scientific practice but also by realizing ones creativity.
Patrick Müller
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 4
This year I’m participating the iGEM competition for the first time. By working on a topic of my own interest and throughout various tasks which exceed my university’s curriculum, I’m expecting to improve my own abilities and hope to be able to broaden my horizon.
Steven Pilger
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 6
After all the positive experiences i made last year and all the knowledge i was able to take from the project it was clear to me, that i wanted to be a part of the iGEM team in 2016. This year as a project coordinator i try to make sure that we run on schedule and reach our milestones in time.
Bianca Reisinger
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 6
Last year, I participated in iGEM for the first time. I had a lot of fun and I was able to gather many experiences.  This time I am hoping to pass on the experiences to the new members so that they have a great time, too.  I am looking forward to this years' project and to the challenges waiting for us.
Sabine Schäfer
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 4
I heard from iGEM by a chance, but it indeed impressed me so that I'm taking part of the project this year for the first time. I am always interested in new challenges and this project is in contrast to the university everyday life a possibility to work independently or in the group and to do research. I am glad to collect valuable experiences and I am curious about how our project develops during the next months.
Maik Schork
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 4
This is the first time I participated in the iGem-Project, which I heard about by fluke and since the first open meeting, I could not get off. The concept of introducing my own ideas in an open project during my early studies fascinated me and I don't regret my participation. It's the first time I can be part of open research, which starts at the recrutation of financiers to the coordination of the project, ending in laboratory work and I'm really looking forward to the next steps of the project. I hope we can tie in with the achievements of the last years.
Inka Schröter
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 4
I am studying biology in the 4th semester and am participating the first time in iGEM. I was so fascinated by the older projects that i wanted to take part in one too. Moreover i am enthusiastic about the idea to work independently in a lab and about what i am gonna learn.
Viktoria Schuster
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 4
In the course of this year's project I have developed new skills beyond my expectations concerning not only synthetic biology but also scientific presenting and webdesign. Developing a joint research project frow scratch and working independently to this extent is a special and scarce opportunity amongst students for which I am really grateful. Additionally I am very much looking forward to changing experiences with and getting to know iGEM members from all around the world at the Giant Jamboree in October.
Jannik Schwitte
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 4
I am glad to support our iGEM-team this year with my skills and to optimize my own efficiency. I want to gain new working experience and improve my competence in team working, problem solving and working in self responsibility.
Jonas Sindlinger
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 6
Hi, my name is Jonas,  I'm 22 years old and this is my second time participating in iGEM. Why do I do this? I believe that iGEM represents the optimal platform to work freely and to learn at ones own pace. The amount of topics in the context of synthetic biology one can experiment here end at the borders of ones own fantasy... or at the boundaries of the labs funds. Although creativity seems to only be heightened if these are low.  In the course of last years project, I had lots of fun and gained a bit of experience. This year I hope to pass some of this experience down to our new generation.
Daniel Stumpf
Studies: M.Sc. Biology
Hey Hey, my name is Daniel, I am 22 years old and currently studying the master degree course "Technical Biology", here at TU Darmstadt. This year is my 2nd iGEM  year, but now I have a different requirement profile than in 2015. In 2015 the main focus for me as a rookie was on dealing with the lab work, but in 2016  I concentrate on the support and accompaniment of our (again) very big team. In conjunction with Max and Chris I am responsible for the concept and execution of trainings and seminars for our team members, as well as to support the project design of the project coordination. And of course we organize fun events  (brewery tour, hiking days, barbecuing), because our hard working and cool team deserves these events for being for so long in the labs.
Christian Sürder
Studies: M.Sc. Physics
Semester: 15
It's my third year that I participate in iGEM and it seems that I'm the old guy, literally. The challange for me over the last two years was to build up a team structure, develope concepts to save our knowledge and pass it to the next generation of students. This task is nearly completed and this year I like to focus on winning more students from other disciplines, besides biology. In 2014 we had a great project with a good balance of synthetic biology and mechanical engineering.  The challange for this year will be to get into touch with the other disciplines and show them the possibilities within iGEM and in the field of synthetic biology. Therefor we like to creat opportunities for students to get to know the project and the various challanges biology is faceing. For me iGEM is the most interdisciplinary project in the whole TU Darmstadt and the best chance to work in a motivated and colored project group.
Markus Susenburger
Studies: M.Sc. Physics
Semester: 8
It is easy to describe my motivation behind participating at iGEM. At first, it is quite a technical challenge, and secondly I can learn more about complex biological processes.  During my bachelor thesis, I was involved in automatisation, and I would like to share my experience with the team. As it is my first iGEM competition, I can only imagine, but I think it's also a lot of fun.
Thomas Georg Wagner
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 2
My attention for iGEM was called by a former member of the project and my interest was immediately woken. I´m looking forward to the chance to work practical in the early academic years. I want to work besides planned internships in a dedicated team which finds own ideas and solutions.
In addition it is exciting to handle other parts of the project like finances, PR and organisation in the team. Those softskills are essential for our career but not learned in the regular academic studies.
Maximilian Zander
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 6
Gude, My name is Maximilian Zander and I am studying Biomolecular Engineering at the TU Darmstadt in my 6th semester. I already participated on last years´s iGEM team and gathered a lot of positive experience (not only in the laboratory) as well as networking with a lot of young, motivated students. That’s why I want to be a part of iGEM TU Darmstadt 2016. I am very excited to work on this huge team on own ideas and generate an extraordinary project.
Stefan Zens
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 6
This year I am participating at the iGEM competition for the second time and I am looking forward to the challenges of the new project. Last year I had a great time conducting research on a concrete scientific issue together in a huge team which was an instructive relief from every day studies. This year I would like to share my experiences especially my acquired practical skills with the new team members. I am looking forward to an exciting and hopefully successful project!
Yannik Zobus
Studies: M.Sc. Physics
Semester: 8
Heyho, my name is Yannik Zobus and I am currently studying physics in the 8. semester at TU-Darmstadt. This year it is the first time, that I am taking part at the iGEM-project and I am pretty excited about the collaboration with other students coming from different departments. I am especially fond of the independence, that one has to display in this project  as well as of the interdisciplinarity of this project. Moreover, I am happy to be a part of iGEM-2016 at TU-Darmstadt and I hope to learn a lot of new things outside  the framework of my studies of physics.
Michelle Zöller
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 6
Last year, I participated in iGEM for the first time. During this time I learned a lot about lab work.  As a team leader of a small lab group I was also able to gather some first experiences in how to organize a project like iGEM.  This year I decided to participate once again. But this time I will part of the project coordination.  I am hoping to learn a lot about organizing and coordinating a project like this.
Fabian Drywa
Studies: B.A. Soziologie
When a member of this year’s iGEM Team TU Darmstadt told me about iGEM and asked me to help with their Human Practices project I wanted to be part of this right away. As I am a trained chemical technical assistant as well, I am very interested in biological projects like this one and was very happy to be part of this team. My main motivation was to generate a Human Practices project with the best possible scientific standards.
