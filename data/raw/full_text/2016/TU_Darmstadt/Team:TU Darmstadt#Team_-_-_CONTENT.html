As I covered the basics now, I have the chance to follow my interests to gather experiences in the laboratory. This is what I expect from the iGEM-Project.

I am also hoping to pass on the knowledge I gathered in 2014 to our new team members.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="memberlember"><DIV class="memText"><H6>

When I first heard of iGEM I knew I had to be part of it, I've got flattered about the idea on learning and working with student colleagues in a whole independent way which students are used to in the college routine. I'm very optimistic and excited about our project, the whole team is in syntony and ready to help each other.
So far I had only good experiences. I know how much knowledge this project will bring us all and this is for me the biggest reason to dedicate and push myself to the most professional I can get.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="memberlember"><DIV class="memText"><H6>Franziska Hameister</H6><P>

This year I am joining the iGEM Team of the TU Darmstadt for the first time. I look forward to gain many new experiences and getting to know people from different places. The most interesting part about iGEM is the work in a team without anybody, who tells you what to do. Therefore we have to deal with upcoming problems and the right solutions on our own. By this way of “Learning by doing” I am convinced to remember the methods and processes easier. Moreover I am happy about the iGEM community, meetings with different iGEM team and some travels, because next to the working periods should always be some free time for socializing.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="memberlember"><DIV class="memText"><H6>Claudia Kreher</H6><P>Studies: M.Sc.

Furthermore I hope to find new friends and have a nice time with them besides the work in the lab.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="memberlember"><DIV class="memText"><H6>Milana Kremenovic</H6><P>

since the first open meeting, I could not get off.
The concept of introducing my own ideas in an open project during my early studies fascinated me and I don't regret my participation.
It's the first time I can be part of open research, which starts at the recrutation of financiers to the coordination of the project, ending in laboratory work and I'm really looking forward

Hi, my name is Jonas,  I'm 22 years old and this is my second time participating in iGEM. Why do I do this? I believe that iGEM represents the optimal platform to work freely and to learn at ones own pace. The amount of topics in the context of synthetic biology one can experiment here end at the borders of ones own fantasy... or at the boundaries of the labs funds. Although creativity seems to only be heightened if these are low. 
In the course of last years project, I had lots of fun and gained a bit of experience. This year I hope to pass some of this experience down to our new generation.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="memberlember"><DIV class="memText"><H6> Daniel Stumpf</H6><P>

my name is Daniel, I am 22 years old and currently studying the master degree course &quot;Technical Biology&quot;, here at TU Darmstadt. This year is my 2nd iGEM 
year, but now I have a different requirement profile than in 2015. In 2015 the main focus for me as a rookie was on dealing with the lab work, but in 2016 
I concentrate on the support and accompaniment of our (again) very big team. In conjunction with Max and Chris I am responsible for the concept and execution
of trainings and seminars for our team members, as well as to support the project design of the project coordination. And of course we organize fun events 
(brewery tour, hiking days, barbecuing), because our hard working and cool team deserves these events for being for so long in the labs.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="memberlember"><DIV class="memText"><H6>Christian Sürder

Semester: 15
It's my third year that I participate in iGEM and it seems that I'm the old guy, literally. The challange for me over the last two years was to build up a team structure, develope concepts to save our knowledge and pass it to the next generation of students. This task is nearly completed and this year I like to focus on winning more students from other disciplines, besides biology. In 2014 we had a great project with a good balance of synthetic biology and mechanical engineering. 
The challange for this year will be to get into touch with the other disciplines and show them the possibilities within iGEM and in the field of synthetic biology. Therefor we like to creat opportunities for students to get to know the project and the various challanges biology is faceing.
For me iGEM is the most interdisciplinary project in the whole TU Darmstadt and the best chance to work in a motivated and colored project group.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="memberlember"><DIV class="memText"><H6>Markus Susenburger</H6><P>
