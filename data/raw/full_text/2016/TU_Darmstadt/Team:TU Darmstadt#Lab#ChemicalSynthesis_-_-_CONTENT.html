When chemically altering an amino acid to a non‑naftural derivate the higher reactivity of the amino and carboxyl groups in comparison to the desired reactive group has to be considered. For this reason, amino and carboxyl groups need to be protected before carrying out the desired synthesis.
For the protection of the amino group an acetylation reaction was performed to form <I>N</I>‑acetyl‑L‑tyrosine, which was then methylated at the carboxyl group and the hydroxyl group using dimethyl sulfate in a Williamson ether synthesis. In order to finally form the non‑natural amino acid, an acidic hydrolysis using hydrochloric acid was performed.</P></DIV><DIV class="content"><H5>Theoretical Background</H5><P>In order to methylate the <I>p</I>‑hydroxy group at the benzene ring of tyrosine, the amino group which is more reactive needs to be protected. Acetic anhydride is used to acetylate the amino group for creating a prospective group (see figure 1) [1].</P><DIV class="bild"><CENTER><B>Figure 1</B>: Reaction mechanismn of an acetylation of the amino group to protect the site from unwanted side reactions in later synthesis steps.</CENTER></DIV><P>The second step was a Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is added in order to deprotonate both hydroxyl groups of the amino acid. Dimethyl sulfate (DMS) transfers its methyl group to the deprotonated hydroxyl group at the benzene ring of tyrosine. Simultaneously, the other methyl group is added to the carboxyl group as a methoxyl group (see figure 2) [1].</P><DIV class="bild"><CENTER><B>Figure 2</B>: Reaction mechanism of a Williamson ether synthesis to add a methyl groups to both hydroxy functions of the amino acid.

The solution was heated up to 65 °C before acetic anhydride was added to the solution. After a second heating step for 2 hours, the heating process was stopped and a milky white precipitation was visible.
		The pH value was adjusted to pH 12 by the addition of NaOH. The solution was heated up to reach 42 °C and then 5.22 ml DMS was added. Afterwards, the solution was heated up to 100 °C for 30 min and set to cool down. The solution was used for a thin-layer chromatography (TLC) in order to prove, if primary amino groups were present (see results).</P><H6>Sample B</H6><P>5 g tyrosine were dissolved in 100 ml H<SUB>2</SUB>O and the solution was heated up to 65 °C. Acetic anhydrite and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were added simultaneously to the solution to ensure a constant pH value between slightly acidic and neutral. The pH value needs to be neutral for the reaction of tyrosine and acetic anhydrite because of the weak solubility of tyrosine in H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Acetic anhydride works as a protective group at the amino group of tyrosine. The solution was heated up for 2 hours. As soon as the solution turned into a clear green colored solution, the heating process was stopped.

		The organic phase was set into a rotary evaporator with the help of negative pressure to distillate the solution in order to acquire the intermediate product (step 3; scheme). The product which was left in the evaporator was added to a three-necked flask with H<SUB>2</SUB>O and a small amount of hydrochloric acid (pH 1) and then heated up to 100 °C for 30 min. In order to increase the yield of the product, NaOH was added so that the solution was saponified shifting the equilibrium towards the product. During the reaction a yellow colored substance appeared on the surface of the solution, which was aspirated. The by-product was dried and the melting point was determined to 92 °C.
			
		Further hydrochloric acid was added to the solution and heated up for 30 min. While cooling off, NaOH was added to the solution to adjust the pH value to 5.66 which is the isoelectric point of tyrosine.
			
		Subsequently the solution was recrystallized with the help of activated carbon and cooled down in an ice bath in order to precipitate the product. The sediment was filtered and dried to measure the melting point.</P><H6>Sample B2</H6><P>After cooling MTBE (Methyl <I>tert</I>‑butyl ether) was added to the solution which was filled into a separating funnel for the extraction.

To ensure that the target molecule was synthesized, further analysis of the samples should be performed. Analytical methods like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gas chromatography (GC), IR spectroscopy or mass spectrometry (MS) are capable to identify the structure of the molecules represented by sample B1 and B2. Due to temporal restrictions the successful synthesis of <I>O</I>‑methyl‑<SPAN style="font-variant:small-caps">l</SPAN>‑tyrosine and the final analyses could not be perforemed. 

However, it is a great success to have achieved positive results after running the very first experiment. In retrospect, we can proudly display our exertions as a co-working team that has learned a lot especially concerning preparative organic chemistry. In coming iGEM projects, more in‑depth cooperations with the chemistry department are conceivable and projects with a greater chemistry part are of potential future interest, so the established connections could be of high value to the next generations of iGEM teams in Darmstadt.</P><H5>Methods</H5><H6>Recrystallization</H6><P>Recrystallization is a process for purifying a solid or crystalline substance.
			
		The substance is dissolved and filtered to remove impurities and to regain the crystallized product. Recrystallization depends on temperature and solubility of the purified substance and its impurities. The substance is required to be soluble under high temperatures and less soluble if the temperature is lowered. 
		Solvent and substance should have similar polarities and the solvent should be inert towards the recrystallized substance. Expected impurities should be highly or unremarkably soluble in the chosen solvent. The optimal solvent and its volume is usually determined in several experiments before the recrystallization process can be started.
			
		During the conduction the isoelectric point of tyrosine was used for precipitation. The isoelectric point of tyrosine is 5.66 [3], the pH value where tyrosine possess the lowest solubility in H<SUB>2</SUB>O.</P><H6>Thin-layer Chromatography (TLC)</H6><P>Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is based on two principles called adsorption and distribution. Adsorption means dissolved substances in leveling agents adsorb on stationary phase (e.g. silica gel) and distribution describes different solubility of substances in different and non-mixed liquid phases. For separation, both effects play a role.
			
		The stationary phase has three characteristics: Chemical structure (cellulose, silica gel, poly amide, etc.), grain size (smaller and more uniform grains for higher separating efficiency) and film thickness (100‑250 μm).
		Leveling agents in the mobile phase also have influence on separation, they allow polar groups of the substance to be separated. Often a mixture of different leveling agents is used.
			
		The main concepts of thin-layer chromatography (TLC) are separating efficiency, selectivity and saturation of the separating chamber.
		Separating efficiency can be observed by spot widening with increasing separation height. The general spot widening decreases when separating efficiency increases.
		Separating efficiency is influenced by selectivity, how well two similar substances can be separated from each other. In the separating chamber, the movement has to be vertical, the saturation with fumes in the separating chamber should be optimal for best results.
		Leveling agents flow across the stationary phase due capillary forces. The solvent front must not reach the upper edge of the thin layer. After removing the thin layer, the solvent front has to be marked and dried in a horizontal position.</P><B>Implementation and Development of TLC</B><P><OL><LI><B>Sample preparation</B></LI>
			The sample has to be a homogeneous liquid. Typically purified samples are used. Comparative solutions of known concentrations are used as control samples.
			<LI><B>Sample apply</B></LI>
			The samples should be placed on a line 1 cm from the edge. The distance between the samples should be about 1 cm as well. Typical sample volume ranges between 1-10 μl. 
			<LI><B>Chromatogram development</B></LI>
		The liquid level in the chamber must not touch the applied samples at any time. Furthermore, the TLC plate must not stand towards the wall with its coated surface because of capillary effects. The mobile phase moves across the TLC plate. The solvent front may not reach the end of the TLC plate.
		</OL></P><P>After development, the solvent front is immediately marked by a pencil.
		The chamber should not be put into the air stream of the fume hood.
		For detection mostly either fluorescence or fluorescence-discharge is used. Fluorescence can help to visualize the sample via UV‑light, fluorescence‑discharge has a fluorescing layer integrated into the TLC plate. Some substances prevent fluorescence and do not appear under UV light. In addition, coloring chemicals (<I>e.g.</I> ninhydrin) may be sprayed on the TLC plates after chromatography.</P><P><B>Quantitative analysis</B></P><P>
		The amount of the substances can be estimated by the size of the spot. TLC-scanners (densitometric evaluation) measure the intensity of reflected light with a certain wavelength. </P><H6>Development of a TLC with the ninhydrin‑test</H6><P>Ninhydrin targets primary amino groups. These amino groups are colored yellow on the TLC with the reaction in the scheme below.</P><DIV class="class"><CENTER><B>Figure 6</B>: Reaction scheme of the ninhydrin test for coloring primary amino groups after chromatography.
</CENTER></DIV><H6>Melting point determination</H6><P>Melting point determination is a standard identification method in chemistry for solid products. The melting point of a substance depends on its crystal construction. If there is a contamination, the melting point decreases.
		Deviations from literature values up to 1-2 centigrade are tolerable. The substance is placed in a capillary tube and heated up until the substance starts to melt. </P></DIV><DIV class="references"><H6>References</H6><UL><LI>[1]Wiley-VCH, Organikum, 24. Edition, ISBN:978‑3‑527‑33968‑6</LI><LI>[2]<A href="http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.2006112.html">http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.2006112.html</A> 10/12/2016</LI><LI>[3]<A href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/L-tyrosine#section=LogS">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/L-tyrosine#section=LogS</A>10/12/2016</LI></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV class="rechts"><DIV class="scrollbox"><BUTTON class="see_other_full"><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/Lab">Back to the Lab</A></BUTTON><DIV class="highlights"><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/Lab/OrthogonalPair">Incorporation of a nnAA</A><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/Lab/Reporter">Reporter</A><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/Lab/KILLswitch">KILL(switch)</A><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/Lab/MetabolicBurden">Metabolic Burden</A><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/Lab/ChemicalSynthesis">Chemical Synthesis</A></DIV><BUTTON class="back_top_full"><A href="#mainHeader">Back to the Top</A></BUTTON></DIV></DIV><DIV class="footer" style="text-decoration: none;"><CENTER><DIV id="igemTUDA"><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt" style="color:white">iGEM Technische Universität Darmstadt</A></DIV></CENTER><CENTER><DIV id="footer_linear">
