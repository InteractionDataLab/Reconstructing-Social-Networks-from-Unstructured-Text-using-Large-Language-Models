Team
We are a student led, start-up iGEM team, attempting to establish a recurring iGEM team based at the University of Auckland, NZ. We are the first iGEM team in NZ, meaning key challenges we faced were gathering a team, getting PIs and advisors on board, securing funding and lab space to work in, establishing protocols to use, and, of course, getting the science to work.
