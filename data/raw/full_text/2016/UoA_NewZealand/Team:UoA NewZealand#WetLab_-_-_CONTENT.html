Couldn’t tell using the iGEM competency test (which added a plasmid with chloramphenicol resistance) how competent our cells were, as those transformed with the iGEM plasmid would have been selected against. Switched to DH5 alpha cells for further transformations.

Kan backbone + PETase End colonies grew on plates
1) Kan plate and competent cells - no growth
2) + 3) - PETase end + kanamycin backbone - many small colonies
4) negative control - kan plate and no cells - no growth
5) plain agar plate with cells ‘transformed’ with PETase end (to see growth of cells after transformation) - lawn of cells

Protocol: Maggie’s miniprep
* Tried different miniprep protocol of PETase end colonies grown previous day
* Left the streaked colonies from previous day in incubation room to grow more.
* Carried out miniprep
 * DNA concentration of plasmid via nanodrop non-existent
 * (~–7.5 ng/uL to –0.5 ng/uL)
* Decided to up concentration of antibiotic to put more selective pressure on bacteria with plasmid
* Made up 6 liquid cultures with 80ug/mL kanamycin (up from previous plates/liquid cultures - 50ug/mL)
* Left in incubation room overnight for miniprep next day </P><H4>Date: 30/09/16</H4><P>People: David (???)
* Miniprepped the PETase end liquid cultures that were grown with higher kanamycin concentration
 * Again, no results, no plasmid DNA
* The start of Troubleshooting™ v 2.0
 * Want to transform with:
 * Empty IGEM plasmid
 * New plasmid + Construct
 * Transformation with Kyle’s plasmid - peroxiredoxin
 * Plate transformed cells onto plates with Kyle’s kanamycin
* Plated up cells onto Kyle’s kanamycin plates:
 * 4 PETase end on kyle’s kan plates
 * 1 DH5αα alpha (no transformation) plated on kyle’s kan
 * 1 control of plain agar, spread with DH5αα alpha (no transformation) </P><H4>Date: 1/10/16</H4><P>People: May, David &amp; Grace
* Created new digestion mixtures
* Realised all PETase constructs except start have second EcoRI site (and Not 1 sites)
 * Only transform PETase start with EcoRI - will have to use XbaI for other constructs
* Decided to do transformations with kanamycin backbone and chloramphenicol backbone (pSB1C3) (kan was running low on stock and why tf not at this point in time lmao)
* pSB1c3 - has chloramphenicol resistance, same RE sites, and pUC19 derived ori
* Digest:
 * Mastermix - may have extra BSA
 * Excess NEB in tube after adding to master mix - not sure why
 * Created three digests:
 * 1 - 6 uL water / 2 uL kan backbone / 4 uL MM
 * 2 - 6 uL PETase start (PCR) / 2uL chlor backbone / 4 uL MM
 * B - 4 uL MM / 4 uL water
* Ligation:
 * Created 3 ligation products: - note, forgot to add ATP again like idiots :P
 * 1 - 4uL digest 1 / 1 uL T4 DNA ligase buffer / 0.5 uL T4 ligase / 4.5 uL water
 * 2 - 4uL digest 2 / 1 uL T4 DNA ligase buffer / 0.5 uL T4 ligase / 4.5 uL water
 * B - 4 uL digest B / 1 uL T4 DNA ligase buffer / 0.5 uL T4 ligase / 6.5 uL water
 * Incubated - 16C/30 mins + 80C/20 mins
* Prepped plates for spreading on transformants
 * 3 x kanamycin plates
 * Kanamycin backbone only transformants (1)
 * 3 x chloramphenicol plates
 * Chloramphenicol backbone + PETase start transformants (2)
 * 3 x ampicillin plates
 * Peroxiredoxin plasmid transformation (Kyle’s)
 * Agar had started to set when we were plating - ampicillin will be at a slightly lower concentration
 * 4 x plain agar plates
 * 1 x each for each transformant + 1 for control
* Electrotransformation
 * (Grace had to leave, David remained behind after brief walk through transformation protocol)
 * Used Shaun’s electrotransformation protocol
 * Transformations:
 * Kanamycin backbone only:
 * 40 uL our cells + 1 uL ligation 1
 * kV = 1.82 / T = 6.10 ms
 * Peroxiredoxin:
 * 40 uL our cells + 0.5 uL plasmid (to conserve)
 * kV = 1.80 / t = 6.10 ms
 * PETase (diluted- how dilute?) ( to try and prevent arcing):
 * 40 uL our cells + 1 uL ligation product 2
 * kV + t not taken
 * Incubated for 1 hour in 37 C
* Plated for overnight culture:
 * Ampicillin agar x 3:
 * 2 x original concentration of peroxiredoxin plasmids
 * 1 x spun and resuspended cells
 * Expect: colonies, if not = cells/transformation not viable
 * Kanamycin agar x 3:
 * 2 x original concentration of kanamycin backbone transformants
 * 1 x spun and resuspended cells
 * Expect: no colonies, if not = backbone can be expressed without an insert
 * Plain Agar + Kan backbone:
 * 2 x original concentration of kanamycin backbone transformants
 * 1 x spun and resuspended cells
 * Expect: colonies, if no colonies are present, then the cells/transformation is not viable
 * Col Agar + PETase Start x3 : Col Agar + Diluted PETase Start
 * If colonies are present : Successful transformation of Col resistance at least. Complete mini-prep to extract the plasmid. Colonies should be white.
 * If no colonies are present : Cells, transformation or ligation are erroneous
 * Any red colonies have the Col backbone but no insert. Any white colonies have an insert disrupting the RFP.
 * Plain Agar + PETase Start + Dilution x1
 * Expect: colonies, if no colonies are present, then recheck everything!</P><H4>Date : 2/10/2016</H4><P>People : David and Grace</P><P>To do today :

Prepped liquid cultures with ampicilin for protein expression 
Innoculated single colonies from BL21(DE3) transformants 4, 6, 8, 9 &amp; 10 as they all showed bands in previous night where PETase would be expected, also innoculated colony 11 as it shared a band with pET-DUET and could act as a control 
Once cells reach OD600 of 0.5 - will induce protein expression in half
Colony #.1 = cells grown without IPTG || Colony #.2 = cells innoculated with 1mM IPTG
Grew cells for just over 3 hours before adding IPTG to the #.2 colonies.

Mix well and incubate on ice for approx 1 min</P><P>Turn the MicroPulser on and set for your cuvette size (Ec2)
Transfer this mixture of cells and DNA to the cold electroporation cuvette and tap the mixture to the bottom
Place the cuvette in the chamber, pulse once</P><P>Remove the cuvette from the chamber and immediately add 1 ml of LB to the cuvette.
Quickly but gently resuspend the cells.
Transfer this cell suspension to a 13 ml sterile tube and incubate at 37oC for 1 hour, shaking at 225 rpm.</P><P>Check and record the pulse parameters on the MicroPulser. The time constant should be close to 5 milliseconds. The field strength can be calculated as actual volts (kV) / cuvette gap (cm).</P><P>After 1 hour incubation, spread 100 μl of the transformation onto an LB + antibiotic plate (1/10th). Spin the remainder of the transformation down and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 100 μl LB and spread on another LB + antibiotic plate (9/10th). Put both plates in the 37oC room overnight.</P><H3>Making Chemically-competent Cells</H3><P>Pick a single bacterial colony of your strain and transfer into 10 ml LB (5 ml aliquots) in a sterile falcon tube
Incubate overnight at 37 °C, 180 rpm</P><P>Inoculate 50 ml LB in 250 ml sterile flask with 500 μl seed overnight culture
Incubate culture at 37 °C for 1.5 – 3 h, 180 rpm until OD600 = 0.4 – 0.6
Remove cells when growth has reached appropriate OD and place flask on ice to cool cells
Cells MUST be kept on ice at all times to achieve maximum efficiency of transformation</P><P>Transfer of bacterial cells to icecold falcon tubes and centrifuge at ~3000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C
Carefully decant supernatant, then discard. Stand inverted tubes on paper towel for 1 min to drain
last traces of media
Take care that the pellet does not fall out of the falcon tube</P><P>Resuspend pellet in 25 ml ice cold 0.1 M CaCl 2 by pipetting up and down with 10 ml pipette
Incubate on ice for 1 h</P><P>Centrifuge at 4000 xg for 8 min at 4 °C
Carefully remove supernatant
Resuspend cell pellet (pipette up and down) in 3 ml of ice-cold 0.1 M CaCl 2 , 15% (v/v) glycerol
Aliquot 100 μl into autoclaved eppendorf tubes and snap freeze using liquid Nitrogen and store at 80
°C</P><H3>Transformation (Chemically competent cells)</H3><P>Thaw an aliquot of chemically competent cells on ice.
Add DNA (approx. 0.5 ng DNA) to the cells and gently mix with the pipette tip.
Incubate on ice for 30 min.
Heat-shock for 2 min at 42oC.
Add 1 ml LB (no antibiotic).
Incubate for 1 hour at 37oC.</P><P>After this incubation, spread 100 μl of the transformation onto an LB + antibiotic plate (1/10th). Spin the remainder of the transformation down and discard the supernatant.
Resuspend the pellet in 100 μl LB and spread on another LB + antibiotic plate (9/10th). Put both plates in the 37oC room overnight.</P></DIV><DIV class="link"><CENTER><A href="https://www.facebook.com/iGEMUoA"><H3>Like us on Facebook</H3></A><H3>Our Partners</H3></CENTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
