Our Part BBa_K2024000
Our part encodes for a protein derived from Idonella sakaiensis first discovered by Yoshida et al. This protein contains 3 domains. The first, a functional domain, has the ability to cleave polyethylene terephthalanie, the main plastic used in bottles world-wide, into a monomer ethylene terephthalate. The second is a linker domain which is able to be selectively cleaved the TEV protease. The third and final domain is a polyhistadine domain allowing for easy purification of the protein by affinity chromatography.
This part was expressed using the T7 promoter (part BBa_1719005) under the control of the lac operator sequence (unpublished).
