These teams emphasised raising  awareness for the implementation of safe biotechnology into daily use, to elevate the quality of human lives , and the environment. The NTCU Formosa team kindly presented their work to us, as well as sharing details of their past iGEM projects and meet-ups, to give us more of an idea how the iGEM competition works. They elaborated on their human practise projects, which included working closely  with the Ministry of Agriculture in Taiwan, and showed their dedication on making the agriculture sector a more biotech/engineering- friendly place. We shared with them the different policies and regulations of New Zealand regarding to GMO products as New Zealand turn out to have stricter regulations on this matter. </P><H3>NYMU iGEM Team</H3><P>It was lovely meeting up with NYMU iGEM Team team leaders. The team showed absolute dedication and passion on both the lab and human practise. Finding that both teams shared the same vision of bringing positivity into our communities by utilising our bioengineering knowledge, it was not hard at all to fit into this passionate team. The team leaders showed us around their lab area and kindly shared their detailed and well planned perspective on their human practice project which most definitely broaden our horizon as a start-up team on how extensively an iGEM can affect and influence the community. We exchanged with them our experience as a start-up team on what challenge we faced just to get the team together as we are all interested to know what would be the different kind of administrative barriers from a team that have a developed system and a newly set-up. We concluded that the main difference would be the focus that shifted from the system development of the sub-teams and relationship building with the University to inter-team communication and interaction within team members. This is discovery will assist with both teams sustainability in iGEM competition in the future to come.</P><H3>Sydney University Team</H3><P>In true ANZAC spirit, iGEM UoA collaborated with the iGEM team from the University of Sydney. An initial introductory skype session allowed us to meet, give one another a run down on our respective projects, and to figure out how we might be able to assist each other.</P><P>We found that the best way the UoA iGEM team could help the Sydney team would be to liaise with large New Zealand horticulture companies on their behalf. This was done, and a relationship was established with Turner’s and Grower’s NZ who were able to provide the team from Sydney with valuable information regarding the influence of fruit ripening on the produce storage and transportation industry. </P><P>Members of iGEM UoA were also able to fill out a survey provided by the iGEM Sydney, and distribute this survey to other people in order to assist them in their data collection.

To help us at iGEM UoA, the team at the University of Sydney provided their laboratory protocols for His-Tag purification and IPTG Induction. These proved useful as resources in iGEM UoA’s own experimental design. Our Sydney colleagues also liaise with Australian Waste Management Firms on our behalf.</P></DIV><FOOTER><DIV class="link"><CENTER><A href="https://www.facebook.com/iGEMUoA"><H3>Like us on Facebook</H3></A><H3>Our Partners</H3></CENTER></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
