Overview and Results
11/8 First Result ever: Found that the DE3 E. coli cells we were using already had a plasmid with chloramphenicol resistance. Couldn’t tell using the iGEM competency test (which added a plasmid with chloramphenicol resistance) how competent our cells were, as those transformed with the iGEM plasmid would have been selected against. Switched to DH5 alpha cells for further transformations.

Do we have any results of competency of our DH5 alpha cells?
Were they chemically competent?
They were, calculations to the competency on page 12 of lab book 06/09
Also other competent cells - 09/09
gels/photos would be gr9
Optional: mention the fricking RE sites in the middle of the construct?
16/08 (labbook) - Optional: talk about issues with ligation/understanding provided igem protocol
Gel - 31/08
03/09 - 04/09 - made new chemically competent cells
Gained PCR skills 07/09, 08/09
Cells passed competency test, but we weren't seeing any colonies following transformation, switched to electroporation as recommended by our PI, as it would remove more steps that could go wrong in chemical transformation.
23/09 Kan backbone + PETase End colonies grew on plates 1) Kan plate and competent cells - no growth 2) + 3) - PETase end + kanamycin backbone - many small colonies 4) negative control - kan plate and no cells - no growth 5) plain agar plate with cells ‘transformed’ with PETase end (to see growth of cells after transformation) - lawn of cells

Miniprep of kan backbone + PETase end -> 27/09, gel page 20, used another miniprep protocol 29/09 - still no DNA
Could be due to overgrowing colonies
Unlikely, cells displayed kanamycin resistance when innoculated in higher concentration (80ng/ul vs 50ng/ul) and when grown on fresh plates
Grew cells on agar poured with kanamycin stocks from Kyle for elimination of bad antibiotic stock as a variable- still grew
Could be due to fault in construct - EcoRI site that would have cut up the PETase end
Self-ligation of the backbone?
Backbone insertion into the DNA?
WHY
Decided to use fresh DH5 alpha cells and to ditch the faulty construct
03/10 Third Result: electroporation results Decided to use another backbone (pSB1C3) as gel (page 34 - 04/10) showed that PCR of kan backbone not entirely pure and was worried with the previous results of the plasmid being able to insert into the genome/being low copy number/self-ligating. Successfully transformed cells with plasmid given by one of our advisors & confirmed with miniprep page 44 - therefore transformation is not the problem
1 = ampicilin plate with cells transformed with peroxyredoxin plasmid (A positive control, Plasmid from Kyles stocks)- many big colonies
2 = kan backbone (no insert) transformants - no growth
3 = col backbone with PETase start -no growth
Did some transformations with cells provided by our PI - as they were known to be electrocompetent. Also used a plasmid with a multiple cloning site we could use for our construct, pET-DUET to see whether that would take up our construct any easier.
4 = chloramphenicol plate with col backbone digest at 9/10 dilution (no insert) - lawn of plates - issue with antibiotic plating/spreading
5 = ampicilin plate + petduet + PETase - no growth
6 = canvas

Transformed cells :
Shaun’s DH5α, Stats unknown, Incubation began at 5:45 CP PP C Prx
iGEM DH5ααα
CP (2.49 kV, 6.10 ms) PP (2.49 V, 5.80 ms) C (2.49 V, 6 ms) Prx (Unknown)
Have all been plated up: Shaun’s on 1/10 & 9/10 plates, our iGEM cells just 100% on a plate. Restreak of peroxyredoxin cells (Kyle)
Date: 05/10/2016 People : Grace (morning)
Checked transformants Small colonies on peroxyredoxin plates (yay) Lawn of cells on chloramphenicol backbone only plates (chloramphenicol was diluted with water, this may have affected its growth) Other plates = no colonies Use Shaun’s cells from now on, our DH5ααα are probably too dilute to use
Results : Col backbone (negative control) = lawns of cells Col backbone + PETase = N/A PETDUET + PETase = N/A Peroxiredoxin (positive control) = ~100 colonies
Col has been plated on agar with water to dilute instead of ethanol, BUT no biggies .. cuz Col backbone + PETase has nothing growing on it….
Need to miniprep peroxidoxin to figure out whether the steps after ligation have been right
Why are stuffs growing on negative control? Hell knows Shaun can’t figure it out either
Improvement for next digestion :  Separate backbone and insert in different tubes for digestion
New protocol :  Day plans not used anymore but updates Standard protocol folder set up
To do :
Run minipreps of colonies on plates  - Peroxiredoxin cells  - Col backbone LB inoculated 4x Col, 2x Prx Do digest of stocks Col backbone Col + Insert Kan Kan + Insert pET DUET pET DUET + Insert Buffer
Master Mix has been made
Date : 06/10/2016 People : Jess, Grace, Irene
Following Digestion / Ligation protocol 06/10 Digesting insert + backbones separately  3x PETase Start - “PET”  1 x each backbone  K = Kanamycin C = chloramphenicol D = pET Duet
Diluted PETase start PCT tube 1 as for digestion concentration needs to be ~20 ng/uL Original = 290.42 ng/uL 1/10 dilution = 29.04 ng/uL 8mL left
Kan backbone (iGEM) PCR Nanodrop
332.95 ng/uL 333.15 ng/uL 332.70 ng/uL  Diluted 1/10 to give ~ 33.2 ng /uL → 16 uL left
Miniprep liquid cultures haven’t grown - left in incubation room. Make up 3x new preparations of our peroxi transformants with 1% amp in LB Make up 3x Kyle’s peroxi transformants with 1% amp in LB 15 uL amp -> 15mL LB Kyle’s amp is already diluted - don’t use our diluted stock.

Grace’s miniprep liquid cultures of KYle’s and our peroxiredoxin transformants has grown - ready for miniprep
Miniprep time - Grace & David Started miniprep with liquid stock of Kyle’s successful peroxiredoxin + our transformed peroxiredoxin (Shaun’s cells) Mainly to check MAggie’s protocol works + to see that we can miniprep Miniprep of iGEM 1 + 2 are mixed. Should be fine, all from same colony. Miniprep protocol - no visible DNA pellet - continued on anyway

Date: 15/10
PEOPLE: Jess Checking transformation result from previous day Growth on positive control, pET DUET (1 colony) and pET-DUET (double digest) + PETase insert (2 colonies) Innoculated colonies from pET-DUET (double digest) / insert for miniprep Chemically transformed cells provided by Maggie L1, L2 and L3 from previous day (pET-DUET = purified triple digest) following John Taylor’s standard protocol (link)  Heat shocked at 47C instead of 37C - technical error Plated cells at 1/10th dilution (100uL of broth) and at 9/10th dilution (centrifuged cells, removed supernatant and resuspended into 100uL for plating)
Date: 16/10
PEOPLE: David, Grace & Maggie Minipreped pET-DUET (double digest) + PETase transformants from 14/10 - using Super Easy Plasmid Purification protocol (link)  Nanodrop showed that there was successful DNA extraction (2 samples were run, one had concentration of 241.15 ng/uL, other had concentration of 201.62 ng/uL)  Ran gel of plasmids, digested with XbaI, EcoRI + Hind3 (seperately) - but showed a smear with no definitive results.
Date: 17/10
PEOPLE:  Irene, Jess, David & Grace Ran miniprep following Super Easy Plasmid Purification for pET-DUET (triple digest) + PETase transformants from 15/10  All colonies had some absorbance spectra in range of DNA Transformed BL21(DE3) cells using miniprep plasmids from 16/10 pET-DUET (double digest) + PETase
Date: 18/10
PEOPLE: David, Irene, Jess & Grace BL21(DE3) cells transformed on 17/10 were unsuccessful - pET-DUET (double digest) + PETase were unsuccessful - further transformants will refer solely to the pET-DUET (triple digest) and PETase from 15/10  Run digest of miniprep products from previous day using EcoRI and Hind3 (separately) to run on gel  Wasn’t very easy to see which plasmids on gels had the insert in plasmid as pET-DUET wouldn’t show and some plasmids didn’t show up on gel at all.  Transformed all plasmids from 17/10 miniprep into BL21(DE3) strain for next day using Frankie’s protocol (link)
Date: 19/10
PEOPLE: Jess, Grace & David Transformed plates from previous day all showed growth on ampicilin plates = successful transformation into expression strain  As gels of plasmids were widely inconclusive, decided to try and PCR out the insert in the plasmids to see which colonies had the insert. 1 = 1 kb+ ladder  2 = PETase  3 = pET DUET 4 - 14 = Miniprep of colonies 3-13 15 = PCR mixture (negative control) - might be contaminated Colonies 4, 6, 8, 9 + 10 had bands at same level as PETase - most likely to have correct insert
Date: 20/10
PEOPLE: Grace Prepped liquid cultures with ampicilin for protein expression  Innoculated single colonies from BL21(DE3) transformants 4, 6, 8, 9 & 10 as they all showed bands in previous night where PETase would be expected, also innoculated colony 11 as it shared a band with pET-DUET and could act as a control  Once cells reach OD600 of 0.5 - will induce protein expression in half Colony #.1 = cells grown without IPTG || Colony #.2 = cells innoculated with 1mM IPTG Grew cells for just over 3 hours before adding IPTG to the #.2 colonies.   Final OD600 Readings 4.1: 0.486 | 4.2: 0.622 | 6.1: 0.390 | 6.2: 0.706 | 8.1: 0.432 | 8.2: 0.433 | 9.1: 0.395 | 9.2: 0.533 | 10.1: 0.560 | 10.2: 0.637 | 11.1: 0.456 | 11.2: 0.555 |

For two plates : 1. In a 50mL Falcon tube, add 40mL of liquid agar and pipette in 40uL of antibiotic solution. 2. Mix gently. 3. Pour 20mL into both plates.
DNA Gel
Note: Ethidium bromide is dangerous, gloves must be worn in preparation of DNA gel.
Mix 0.3g of DNA gel powder and 30mL of liquid buffer in a conical flask
Microwave at medium power for 2x 30 seconds. Swirl in between.
Microwave for another 15 seconds at medium power. The solution should have no cloudiness / be completely clear.
Pour into set. Pipette in 2uL of ethidium bromide (stored in a light-sensitive Eppendorf tube) and swirl with your (gloved) finger,
Throw glove out.
Put in the cast to set the wells and leave to harden.

Making Electrocompetent Cells
Make up 500ml LB. Make 1L of 10% glycerol Pick a colony from cell streak and add to 5ml of LB - Put in shaker at 37oC overnight
Add the 5ml culture to the 500ml LB Shake at 37oC - grow cells until OD600 = 0.5 - 0.7 (takes a few hours) Put cells, the 10% glycerol solution and all centrifuge bottles and tubes on ice
Transfer cell culture to a cold centrifuge bottle and spin at 4000 × g for 15 min at 4oC. Carefully pour off and discard the supernatant Gently resuspend the pellet in 500ml ice-cold 10% glycerol
Centrifuge at 4000 × g for 15 min at 4oC. Carefully pour off and discard the supernatant. Gently resuspend the pellet in 250ml of ice-cold 10% glycerol
Centrifuge at 4000 × g for 15 min at 4oC. Carefully pour off and discard the supernatant Resuspend the pellet in approx. 20ml of ice-cold 10% glycerol
Centrifuge at 4000 × g for 15 min at 4oC Carefully pour off and discard the supernatant Resuspend the cells in 1 – 2 ml of ice-cold 10% glycerol ( (Cell concentration should be about 1 – 3 × 1010 cells/ml, so if you harvested the cells at OD600=0.5 resuspend in 1ml, if at OD600=0.7 resuspend in 2ml).
Aliquot out this cell suspension (50μl per aliquot) into 1.5ml microcentrifuge tubes and snap freeze in liquid nitrogen. Store in –80oC freezer.
Transformation (Electrocompetent cells)
For each sample to be transformed: place a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and an electroporation cuvette (0.1 cm) on ice. Thaw an aliquot of competent cells on ice In the cold 1.5 ml tube, mix 40 μl of competent cells with at least 100ng of DNA (2ul of 50ng/ul) Mix well and incubate on ice for approx 1 min
Turn the MicroPulser on and set for your cuvette size (Ec2) Transfer this mixture of cells and DNA to the cold electroporation cuvette and tap the mixture to the bottom Place the cuvette in the chamber, pulse once
Remove the cuvette from the chamber and immediately add 1 ml of LB to the cuvette. Quickly but gently resuspend the cells. Transfer this cell suspension to a 13 ml sterile tube and incubate at 37oC for 1 hour, shaking at 225 rpm.
Check and record the pulse parameters on the MicroPulser. The time constant should be close to 5 milliseconds. The field strength can be calculated as actual volts (kV) / cuvette gap (cm).
After 1 hour incubation, spread 100 μl of the transformation onto an LB + antibiotic plate (1/10th). Spin the remainder of the transformation down and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 100 μl LB and spread on another LB + antibiotic plate (9/10th). Put both plates in the 37oC room overnight.
Making Chemically-competent Cells
Pick a single bacterial colony of your strain and transfer into 10 ml LB (5 ml aliquots) in a sterile falcon tube Incubate overnight at 37 °C, 180 rpm
Inoculate 50 ml LB in 250 ml sterile flask with 500 μl seed overnight culture Incubate culture at 37 °C for 1.5 – 3 h, 180 rpm until OD600 = 0.4 – 0.6 Remove cells when growth has reached appropriate OD and place flask on ice to cool cells Cells MUST be kept on ice at all times to achieve maximum efficiency of transformation
Transfer of bacterial cells to icecold falcon tubes and centrifuge at ~3000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C Carefully decant supernatant, then discard. Stand inverted tubes on paper towel for 1 min to drain last traces of media Take care that the pellet does not fall out of the falcon tube
Resuspend pellet in 25 ml ice cold 0.1 M CaCl 2 by pipetting up and down with 10 ml pipette Incubate on ice for 1 h
Centrifuge at 4000 xg for 8 min at 4 °C Carefully remove supernatant Resuspend cell pellet (pipette up and down) in 3 ml of ice-cold 0.1 M CaCl 2 , 15% (v/v) glycerol Aliquot 100 μl into autoclaved eppendorf tubes and snap freeze using liquid Nitrogen and store at 80 °C
Transformation (Chemically competent cells)
Thaw an aliquot of chemically competent cells on ice. Add DNA (approx. 0.5 ng DNA) to the cells and gently mix with the pipette tip. Incubate on ice for 30 min. Heat-shock for 2 min at 42oC. Add 1 ml LB (no antibiotic). Incubate for 1 hour at 37oC.
After this incubation, spread 100 μl of the transformation onto an LB + antibiotic plate (1/10th). Spin the remainder of the transformation down and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 100 μl LB and spread on another LB + antibiotic plate (9/10th). Put both plates in the 37oC room overnight.
