Our Solution
The bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis uses two enzymes to break PET down into Terephthatlic Acid (TPA) and Ethylene Glycol (EG);: PETase and MHETase respectively (Yoshida et al., 2016). It is here that we took inspiration for our project;Thus our project was born: to create biobricks for PETase and MHETase that, when inserted into an E. coli vector, could produce viable, purifiable proteins, that are secreted from the cell, or can be obtained through lysing the E. coli.either through lysis or by secretion. Given time, effort, and perhaps a little luck, we could purify and find will attempt finding the 3D structure of these PET degrading enzymes, which would allow us to characterise them, and potentially refine and improve the mechanism of PET degradation for commercial use. allowing for greater classification, and potential refinement of the mechanism.
