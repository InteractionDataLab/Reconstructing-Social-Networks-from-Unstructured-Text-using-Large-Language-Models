Date: 12/09/16
People: ???? (Jess?) Goals: Check transformation * Checked colonies: * Competency worked - colourless colonies {little did we know……. They were already chloramphenicol resistant} * Transformed Bacteria (PETases) - no colonies  * Incubated overnight to see if would get new growth

People: Thai & Jess Protocol : 02/09 protocol The day things fucked up :’< * Didn’t make up chemically competent cells - ran out of time everything had to be chucked out

Date: 09/09/16
People: David * DH5ααalpha competency - chemically competent cells?  * Measured OD600 of 0.3 - returned to incubation room to bring to OD600 of 1 * PCR products:  * Made new buffer to blank nanodrop with (what was it)??  * Machine gave warning that absorbance too high in blank  * Measured concentrations in book - page 15 * Prepared to run gel - 8 lanes but ran out of time

People: Maggie: * Checked transformed plates * No growth on negative controls * Small colonies on kan + PETase end plate - incubated a little longer to try and grow colonies a little longer
26/09/16
People: Maggie, Jess, David + Grace * PETase end grew (yay) * Maggie and Jess started miniprep following kit instructions * Miniprep yielded no results - appears to be no Plasmid present in PETase end cells
28/09/16
People: Jess, Grace + Irene - morning * Streaked out 4 colonies from PETase end transformation onto kan plates * Afternoon: Maggie + Jess * Made liquid broth cultures of 4 colonies for miniprep  * Previous miniprep DNA too low to show up on gel  * Gel on page 20
Date: 29/09
People: Maggie + Grace (morning) Protocol: Maggie’s miniprep * Tried different miniprep protocol of PETase end colonies grown previous day * Left the streaked colonies from previous day in incubation room to grow more. * Carried out miniprep  * DNA concentration of plasmid via nanodrop non-existent  * (~–7.5 ng/uL to –0.5 ng/uL) * Decided to up concentration of antibiotic to put more selective pressure on bacteria with plasmid * Made up 6 liquid cultures with 80ug/mL kanamycin (up from previous plates/liquid cultures - 50ug/mL) * Left in incubation room overnight for miniprep next day

Date: 1/10/16
People: May, David & Grace * Created new digestion mixtures * Realised all PETase constructs except start have second EcoRI site (and Not 1 sites)  * Only transform PETase start with EcoRI - will have to use XbaI for other constructs * Decided to do transformations with kanamycin backbone and chloramphenicol backbone (pSB1C3) (kan was running low on stock and why tf not at this point in time lmao) * pSB1c3 - has chloramphenicol resistance, same RE sites, and pUC19 derived ori * Digest:  * Mastermix - may have extra BSA  * Excess NEB in tube after adding to master mix - not sure why  * Created three digests:  * 1 - 6uL water / 2 uL kan backbone / 4 uL MM  * 2 - 6uL PETase start (PCR) / 2uL chlor backbone / 4 uL MM  * B - 4 uL MM / 4 uL water * Ligation:  * Created 3 ligation products: - note, forgot to add ATP again like idiots :P  * 1 - 4uL digest 1 / 1 uL T4 DNA ligase buffer / 0.5 uL T4 ligase / 4.5 uL water  * 2 - 4uL digest 2 / 1 uL T4 DNA ligase buffer / 0.5 uL T4 ligase / 4.5 uL water  * B - 4 uL digest B / 1 uL T4 DNA ligase buffer / 0.5 uL T4 ligase / 6.5 uL water  * Incubated - 16C/30 mins + 80C/20 mins * Prepped plates for spreading on transformants  * 3 x kanamycin plates  * Kanamycin backbone only transformants (1)  * 3 x chloramphenicol plates  * Chloramphenicol backbone + PETase start transformants (2)  * 3 x ampicillin plates  * Peroxiredoxin plasmid transformation (kyle’s)  * Agar had started to set when we were plating - ampicillin will be at a slightly lower concentration  * 4 x plain agar plates  * 1 x each for each transformant + 1 for control * Electrotransformation  * (Grace had to leave, David remained behind after brief walk through transformation protocol)  * Used Shaun’s electrotransformation protocol  * Transformations:  * Kanamycin backbone only:  * 40uL our cells + 1uL ligation 1  * kV = 1.82 / T = 6.10 ms  * Peroxiredoxin:  * 40uL our cells + 0.5uL plasmid (to conserve)  * kV = 1.80 / t = 6.10 ms  * PETase (diluted- how dilute?) ( to try and prevent arcing):  * 40uL our cells + 1uL ligation product 2  * kV + t not taken  * Incubated for 1 hour in 37C * Plated for overnight culture:  * Ampicillin agar x 3:  * 2 x original concentration of peroxiredoxin plasmids  * 1 x spun and resuspended cells  * Expect: colonies, if not = cells/transformation not viable  * Kanamycin agar x 3:  * 2 x original concentration of kanamycin backbone transformants  * 1 x spun and resuspended cells  * Expect: no colonies, if not = backbone can be expressed without an insert  * Plain Agar + Kan backbone:  * 2 x original concentration of kanamycin backbone transformants  * 1 x spun and resuspended cells  * Expect: colonies, if no colonies are present, then the cells/transformation is not viable  * Col Agar + PETase Start x3 : Col Agar + Diluted PETase Start  * If colonies are present : Successful transformation of Col resistance at least. Complete mini-prep to extract the plasmid. Colonies should be white.  * If no colonies are present : Cells, transformation or ligation are erroneous  * Any red colonies have the Col backbone but no insert. Any white colonies have an insert disrupting the RFP.  * Plain Agar + PETase Start + Dilution x1  * Expect: colonies, if no colonies are present, then recheck everything!

Transformation:  1. Col backbone + PETase (ECP)  2. PET DUET + PETase (EPP)  3. Col backbone (EC)  4. Peroxidoxin (Prx) (in tube of conc. 1ng/uL labelled PRX)
Transformed cells :
Shaun’s DH5α, Stats unknown, Incubation began at 5:45 CP PP C Prx
iGEM DH5ααα
CP (2.49 kV, 6.10 ms) PP (2.49 V, 5.80 ms) C (2.49 V, 6 ms) Prx (Unknown)
Have all been plated up: Shaun’s on 1/10 & 9/10 plates, our iGEM cells just 100% on a plate. Restreak of peroxyredoxin cells (Kyle)
Date: 05/10/2016 People : Grace (morning)
Checked transformants Small colonies on peroxyredoxin plates (yay) Lawn of cells on chloramphenicol backbone only plates (chloramphenicol was diluted with water, this may have affected its growth) Other plates = no colonies Use Shaun’s cells from now on, our DH5ααα are probably too dilute to use
Results : Col backbone (negative control) = lawns of cells Col backbone + PETase = N/A PETDUET + PETase = N/A Peroxiredoxin (positive control) = ~100 colonies
Col has been plated on agar with water to dilute instead of ethanol, BUT no biggies .. cuz Col backbone + PETase has nothing growing on it….
Need to miniprep peroxidoxin to figure out whether the steps after ligation have been right
Why are stuffs growing on negative control?  Hell knows Shaun can’t figure it out either
Improvement for next digestion :  Separate backbone and insert in different tubes for digestion
New protocol :  Day plans not used anymore but updates Standard protocol folder set up
To do :
Run minipreps of colonies on plates  - Peroxiredoxin cells  - Col backbone LB inoculated 4x Col, 2x Prx Do digest of stocks Col backbone Col + Insert Kan Kan + Insert pET DUET pET DUET + Insert Buffer
Master Mix has been made
Date : 06/10/2016 People : Jess, Grace, Irene
Following Digestion / Ligation protocol 06/10 Digesting insert + backbones separately  3x PETase Start - “PET”  1 x each backbone  K = Kanamycin C = chloramphenicol D = pET Duet
Diluted PETase start PCT tube 1 as for digestion concentration needs to be ~20 ng/uL Original = 290.42 ng/uL 1/10 dilution = 29.04 ng/uL 8mL left
Kan backbone (iGEM) PCR Nanodrop
332.95 ng/uL 333.15 ng/uL 332.70 ng/uL  Diluted 1/10 to give ~ 33.2 ng /uL → 16 uL left
Miniprep liquid cultures haven’t grown - left in incubation room. Make up 3x new preparations of our peroxi transformants with 1% amp in LB Make up 3x Kyle’s peroxi transformants with 1% amp in LB 15 uL amp -> 15mL LB Kyle’s amp is already diluted - don’t use our diluted stock. Started incubation at 11:00 a.m
Creating 6 Ligation Products
LPD 1 uL of digest pET DUET 3 uL of PETase Start digest I uL ligation buffer, 0.5 uL ligase 3.5 uL of MQ Water , 1uL ATP

Grace’s miniprep liquid cultures of KYle’s and our peroxiredoxin transformants has grown - ready for miniprep
Miniprep time - Grace & David Started miniprep with liquid stock of Kyle’s successful peroxiredoxin + our transformed peroxiredoxin (Shaun’s cells) Mainly to check MAggie’s protocol works + to see that we can miniprep Miniprep of iGEM 1 + 2 are mixed. Should be fine, all from same colony. Miniprep protocol - no visible DNA pellet - continued on anyway
