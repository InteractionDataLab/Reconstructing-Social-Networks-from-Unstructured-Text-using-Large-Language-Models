 Auxotrophy of PACO strain 
The aim of this test was to assess the behaviour of the auxotroph strain PACO at different levels of polyamines being 10mM of Putrescine and 5 mM of spermidine and 0.0195 mM of Putrescine and 0.00975mM of spermidine the highest and the lowest concentration of polyamines respectively. As a control DH5alfa strain was used.
