Part BBa_K2118000: atoC is a promoter whose activation is induced by polyamines. It is taken from Escherica Coli.
BBa_K2118001:
Putrescine aminotransferase gene, also called PATase or PatA, is an original gene from Escherichia Coli. It encodes for a protein which is involved in polyamine degradation, specifically putrescine. It catalyses the first step in one of two pathways for the degradation of this polyamine. It carries out the aminotransferase aminotransferase reaction from putrescine to 2-oxoglutarate which leads to glutamate and 4-aminobutanal. This last compound spontaneously cyclizes to form 1-pyrroline.
BBa_K2118002:
Polyamine oxidase FMS1 gene is original from Saccharomyces Cerevisae. It encodes for a protein which is involved in polyamine degradation, specifically spermine and spermidine. It catalyses the oxidation of both polyamines and it yields to lower chain amines (spermidine and putrescine respectively) and other compounds: 3-aminopropanal and hydrogen peroxide.
BBa_K2118004:
It is a device which allows the expression of FMS1 and PatA genes regulated by the constitutive promoter J23119 taken from the iGEM Parts Registry.
