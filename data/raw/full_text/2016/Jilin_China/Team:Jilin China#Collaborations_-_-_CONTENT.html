On the one hand, by responding to other teams’ questionnaires, we could extend our advantages and help other teams in completing their projects. On the other hand, we are able to learn and get helps from other teams so that we can improve our abilities to complete our own projects.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="section section-1"><DIV class="title active"><P class="tit">1.With BIT-China</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="section section-1"><DIV class="title active"><P class="tit">1.With BIT-China</P><DIV class="content"><P>We’ve constructed a good collaboration with BIT-China since last year, and this year we further improved it. We have collaborated in two aspects. First, the two teams worked together on modeling building for BIT-China, and the whole process lasted for nearly two months. In this case, our team mainly finished the job to optimize the model and tried our best to solve the equations. The detailed information of the model could be seen in the wiki of <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:BIT-China/Collaborations">BIT-China.</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="section section-1"><DIV class="title active"><P class="tit">1.With BIT-China</P><DIV class="content Rcontent"><P>In addition to building model, we also cooperated in experiments. We need to insure that our constructs could express apoptin in Bifidobacterium longum. But the apoptin will be digested by restriction enzymes in Biofidobacterium longum, we need to transfer the device into E.coli to make the apoptin methylated. So our constructs were sent to BIT-China for the confirmatory experiments in E.coli. BIT-China helped us transform the plasmids into cells, and the cells were digested and centrifuged to collect the expression products of the bacteria, and the proteins of the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. The result was shown in the figure. The construct, J23117, which was used in the InterLab experiments, was also sent from BIT-China as a gift to us, and we used it to finish our experiments. And in this summer, one of our members visited BIT-China in Beijing, and discussed a lot about our project with them.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="section section-2"><DIV class="title active"><P class="tit">2.With UESTC_China</P><DIV class="content Rcontent"><P>This year, we initiated the collaboration with <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:UESTC-China/Collaborations">UESTC_China</A>. Our team assisted UESTC_China to confirm the function of their constructs in a new laboratory environment. We use the plate reader to detect the product of the reaction, pNP under 405 nm catalyzed by the expression protein, PETase and the results are as followed (Fig.1) and the enzyme activity was calculated (Fig.2).The results were proved to be good. Besides, we wanted to transform the Rfp part with our HU promoter to up-regulate the expression of Rfp in bifidobacterium so that we could detected the anaerobic environment in vivo by observing the fluorescent light. UESTC_China provided us with the Rfp part and linked HU, following the molecular cloning protocol.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="section section-2"><DIV class="title active"><P class="tit">3.With Tianjin</P><DIV class="content"><P>We communicated with <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Tianjin/Collaborations">Tianjin</A> team about some questions on experiments.
