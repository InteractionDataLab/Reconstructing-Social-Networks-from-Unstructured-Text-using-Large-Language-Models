At the same time, we transfect the plasmid into the MCF-7 cell to prove that apoptin can be harmful to solid tumor cells. We also did the MTT experiment and wound scratch healing assay to prove the function of apoptin. The results were very good. Because of the final examinations, we paused our experiments for 2 weeks.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="section section-4"><DIV class="title"><P class="tit">Notebook</P><DIV class="content"><P><SPAN>Week 10 (July 10-July17)</SPAN></P><P>We read many articles to improve our project.

So, we decided to change something. We made some new competent Bifi cells again. We also modified the condition of the electro transformation (changed the voltage from 1800V to 1250V,1500V and 2000V). The result showed the electro transformation was successful, there were some colonies on the plates. We picked the monoclonal colonies into the PYG medium to culture them. We treated them in centrifuge (8000rmp, 10 minutes) and collected the supernatant to make the sample for SDS-PAGE. The pellet was sonicated with 7 second work and 30 second pulse in ice for 20 minutes. After centrifugation (4℃,12000rmp,20min) , the supernatant was collected into 1.5ml EP tubes to make samples for SDS-PAGE. The pellet was used to make samples for SDS-PAGE and marked.
