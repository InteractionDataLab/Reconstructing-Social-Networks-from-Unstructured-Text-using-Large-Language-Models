Basic Parts
We have cloned 5 basic parts in total.
HU ( BBa_K1932000 ) is the promoter of our devices, which could regulate the expression of the downstream gene in Bifidobacterium. The sequence of RBS was also added into this basic part.
To improve the stability of the devices in Bifidobacterium, the part of PMB1 ( BBa_K1932001 ), is also included.
Sec2 ( BBa_K1932002 ) and Tmp1 ( BBa_K1932003 ) encode signal peptides that direct the secretion process specifically in Bifidobacterium.
The fifth part encodes TAT-Apoptin ( BBa_K1932004 ). This part was originally introduced by the TecMonterrey team in 2013, which could selectively kill the tumor cells.
