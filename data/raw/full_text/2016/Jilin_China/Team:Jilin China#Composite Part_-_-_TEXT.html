Composite Parts
We have 3 composite parts, BBa_K1932005 , BBa_K1932006 and BBa_K1932007 .
BBa_K1932005 consists of BBa_K1932000, BBa_K1932001 and BBa_K1932004. The lack of signal peptide sequences indicates that the therapeutic protein expressed in the Bifidobacterium would not secrete out of the cell, so this device was constructed as a negative control of our project.
BBa_K1932006 consists of BBa_K1932000, BBa_K1932001,BBa_K1932004, and BBa_K1932002.BBa_K1932002 encodes signal peptide Sec2.
BBa_K1932007 consists of BBa_K1932000, BBa_K1932001, BBa_K1932004, and BBa_K1932003. BBa_K1932003 encodes signal peptide Tmp1.
