Huang Luwei was the team leader for Jilin_China in 2016. She was in charge of all the experiments and participated in many human practice activities. She kept track of the deadlines for all the items and managed the whole group so that all the members could work in order. She also finished the confirmatory experiments for UESTC-China. Last but not least, she also illustrated the experimental part in wiki.
