Two orf and one ori , which were selected from PMB-1 and related to gene duplication, were constructed into the plasmid. And then, a HU promoter was constructed to promote the expression of the gene encoding a histone-like protein. At last, vP3 was added into the plasmid. The construction of the plasmid was outsourced to the company. We improve it by adding the signal peptide (Tmp1 and Sec2) to help the secretion of apoptin protein and TAT to help the entering of apoptin into the cells. We added a linker between TAT and apoptin. We designed three plasmids (Tmp1-TAT-Linker-apoptin,Sec2-TAT-Linker-apoptin,TAT-Linker-apoptin) and have them synthesized by company.</P></DIV><P class="tit" style="margin-top:3%;">Plasmid was transformed into E.coil</P><DIV class="content"><P>The competence DH5α and plasmid were kept on ice. 2 μl plasmid was put into 50 μl DH5α and kept on ice for 30min.

Place the short plate on top of a spacer plate. Insert both plates into the casting frame on a flat surface. Be sure that the &quot;legs&quot; of the casting frame are down. Clamp the casting frame and check that the plates were level on the bottom. Then put the casting frame into the casting stand.Combine all reagents except the TEMED for the 15% separating gel. When ready to pour the gel, quickly add the TEMED and mix them and transfer the separating gel solution between the glass plates in the casting chamber to about 3/4 inch below the short plate. Some dH2O was added on top of the gel prior to polymerization to straighten the level of the gel and remove unwanted air bubbles that may be present. After the gel polymerized, the dH2O was removed by absorption with filter paper. Combine all reagents except the TEMED for the 5% stacking gel. When ready to pour the gel, quickly add the TEMED and mix them and transfer the stacking gel solution between the glass plates in the casting chamber. Then insert the well forming comb into the stacking gel quickly. After the the stacking gel polymerized, remove the gel from the casting stand and place it in the electrode assembly with the short plate on the inside.Pour some 1X electrophoresis buffer into the opening of the casting frame between the gel cassettes. Add enough buffer to fill the wells of the gel.Then the comb was gently removed. The polymerized gel between the short plate and spacer plate forms the &quot;gel cassette&quot;. Then pipette 5μl marker or sample into the gel well.Then Cover the tank with the lid aligning the electrodes (black or red) appropriately.Connect the electrophoresis tank to the power supply.The sample run at 60mv until the loading reaches the bottom of the stacking gel then changed the voltage to 80mv until the loading reaches the bottom of the separating gel.Turn off the power supply.Put the gel in a box and add some dH2O to boil for 3 times.Then outwell the dH20 and add some dye liquor to the box and boil for 3 times.Following that,outwell the dye liquor and add some dH2O to the box and boil for 3 times.Finally,outwell the dH20 and add some new dH2O to shake overnight.
