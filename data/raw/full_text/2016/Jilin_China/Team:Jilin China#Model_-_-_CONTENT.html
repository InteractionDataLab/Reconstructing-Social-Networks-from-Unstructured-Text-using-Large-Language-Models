According to the results from TMpred analysis, Tmp1 and Sec2 both have possible transmembrane helixes. For Tmp1, the possible transmembrane helix is from amino acid 18 to 36. For Sec2, the possible transmembrane helix is from amino acid 12 to 28.

While normal somatic cells of the tissue can be viewed as the original species of the ecosystem, tumor cells can be treated as an invasive species. Based on the Lotka-Volterra Model, we can apply an ecology model to analyze the competition relation between tumor cells and somatic cells, and show the curve of population change with time. Based on the Holling Ⅱ Type Functional Reacting Model, we can apply an ecology model to study the predation relation between tumor cells and bifidobacteria, and show the curve of population change with time. Combining all of the relations among tumor cells, bifidobacteria and somatic cells, we can establish an ecological model to estimate the curves of population change of tumor cells and somatic cells when bifidobacteria are introduced into the tissue.
