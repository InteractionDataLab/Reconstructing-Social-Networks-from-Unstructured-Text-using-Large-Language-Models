1.HUST-Cheering Meeting
We always wanted to have a chance to communicate with iGEMers from other teams. During July 7th. – July 9th. , we attended a HUST-Cheering meeting in Wuhan. We were glad to have an opportunity to change our thinking about iGEM with other brilliant iGEMers in China.
The HUST-China team gave an excellent presentation. Their project focused on a new type of biological filter. They designed two ingenious plasmids that can work in prokaryote and eukaryon. This excellent team is also the sponsor of the meeting. They also held many other meetings to introduce the ideas of iGEM.
NCTU-iGEM team talked about a new protein they produced. They named it Pantide and it could be used as an alternative option as an insecticide by decreasing the efficacy of ion channels in lepidopterous larvae. Their presentation was really flawless, and they also talked about two biobricks they made.
NJU-iGEM team mainly introduced a plasmid that could produce hydrogen in prokaryote. The team members were very experienced researchers and we consulted a lot from them.
We also presented our project and many iGEMers gave us advices. They think our project is really interesting, and our modeling is really good. They gave us some advices on improving our experiment, and we are very grateful about that.
