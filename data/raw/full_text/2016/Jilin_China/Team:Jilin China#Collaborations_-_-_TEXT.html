Collaborations
Our team believes that collaboration makes a better project, so we have taken every opportunity to communicate with other teams. On the one hand, by responding to other teams’ questionnaires, we could extend our advantages and help other teams in completing their projects. On the other hand, we are able to learn and get helps from other teams so that we can improve our abilities to complete our own projects.
1.With BIT-China
1.With BIT-China
We’ve constructed a good collaboration with BIT-China since last year, and this year we further improved it. We have collaborated in two aspects. First, the two teams worked together on modeling building for BIT-China, and the whole process lasted for nearly two months. In this case, our team mainly finished the job to optimize the model and tried our best to solve the equations. The detailed information of the model could be seen in the wiki of BIT-China.
1.With BIT-China
In addition to building model, we also cooperated in experiments. We need to insure that our constructs could express apoptin in Bifidobacterium longum. But the apoptin will be digested by restriction enzymes in Biofidobacterium longum, we need to transfer the device into E.coli to make the apoptin methylated. So our constructs were sent to BIT-China for the confirmatory experiments in E.coli. BIT-China helped us transform the plasmids into cells, and the cells were digested and centrifuged to collect the expression products of the bacteria, and the proteins of the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. The result was shown in the figure. The construct, J23117, which was used in the InterLab experiments, was also sent from BIT-China as a gift to us, and we used it to finish our experiments. And in this summer, one of our members visited BIT-China in Beijing, and discussed a lot about our project with them.
2.With UESTC_China
This year, we initiated the collaboration with UESTC_China . Our team assisted UESTC_China to confirm the function of their constructs in a new laboratory environment. We use the plate reader to detect the product of the reaction, pNP under 405 nm catalyzed by the expression protein, PETase and the results are as followed (Fig.1) and the enzyme activity was calculated (Fig.2).The results were proved to be good. Besides, we wanted to transform the Rfp part with our HU promoter to up-regulate the expression of Rfp in bifidobacterium so that we could detected the anaerobic environment in vivo by observing the fluorescent light. UESTC_China provided us with the Rfp part and linked HU, following the molecular cloning protocol.
3.With Tianjin
We communicated with Tianjin team about some questions on experiments. We helped them with the constructing of molecular model so that they could complete their project.
4.With HUST-China
In July of 2016, we attended the iGEM cheering meeting held by Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, and established good relationship with HUST-China. HUST-China also shared the J23117 device with us.
5.With NEU
We gave them information about how to apply for the visa and they shared us their J23117.
6.With Peking
We communicated many details about the InterLab experiments with Peking. They helped us with the amplification of the device J23117 from BIT-China so that we could finish the InterLab experiments.
