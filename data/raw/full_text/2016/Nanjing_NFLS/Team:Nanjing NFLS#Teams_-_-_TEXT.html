Our team made up of 17 middle school students from Nanjing Foreign Language School in Jiangsu, China. Though we may diverse in grades and classes, we are all fanatics about synthetic biology and its future application on environmental science.
We are a team of biology and chemistry lovers and a team of future researchers. We studied, discussed and worked together and are looking forward to show our projects on iGEM stages. Inside schools, we took elective classes in STEM subjects and attended Olympiad competitions together. As the only high school team in southeast China, we are determined to bring all our knowledge together and make our own “steps” in the realm of synthetic biology.
