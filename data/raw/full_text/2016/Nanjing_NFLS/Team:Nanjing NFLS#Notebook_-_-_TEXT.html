Protocol
1) DNA extraction of microcystis
Use PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit（#12888-50，MOBIO）
2) Mutation PCR
Thaw Taq, dNTP, primers, template DNA on ice.
To a new PCR tube, add:
Mix solution well.
Place tube in PCR thermocycler. Set thermocycler program:
Inititial denaturation: 5 min at 95℃;
Loop (35 cycles), Denaturation: 30s at 95℃,Annealing: 30s at 60℃,Elongation: 1min at 72℃;
Final elongation: 10min at 72℃;
Store: 10℃.
We use 5μL of the PCR product for electrophoresis and 45μL for purification.
3) Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
Weigh agarose powder and TAE buffer according to a proper portion, and add them to a 100ml conical flask (we usually make 1.5% Agarose Gel).
Melt the mixture in a microwave until the solution becomes clear (don’t leave the microwave).
Let the solution cool down to about 40-50℃ and add DNA gel stain (usually we use EB), pour the solution into the gel casting tray with appropriate comb.
Let the gel cool until it becomes solid.
PμLl out the comb carefμLly.
Place the gel in the electrophoresis chamber.
Add enough TAE Buffer so that there is about 2-3mm of buffer over the gel.
Pipette DNA samples mixed with appropriate amount of DNA loading buffer (the dye/GeneFinder is in the loading buffer) into wells on the gel.
Run the gel at 135V for about twenty minutes.
4) PCR products cleanup and fragment recovery from gel using QIAGEN kit according to manual.
Qiagen MinElute® Reaction Cleanup kit
Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR reaction and mix. It is not necessary to remove mineral oil or kerosene. For example, add 250 μl of Buffer PB to 50 μl PCR reaction (not including oil).
If pH indicator I has been added to Buffer PB, check that the color of the mixture is yellow. If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 μl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The color of the mixture will turn to yellow.
Place a MinElute column in a provided 2 ml collection tube in a suitable rack.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the MinElute column and centrifuge for 1 min. For maximum recovery, transfer all traces of sample to the column.
Discard flow-through. Place the MinElute column back into the same tube.
To wash, add 750 μl Buffer PE to the MinElute column and centrifuge for 1 min.
Discard flow-through and place the MinElute column back in the same tube. Centrifuge the column for an additional 1 min at maximum speed.
Place the MinElute column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 10 μl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of the membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min.
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.
QIAGEN MinElute® Gel Extraction Kit
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel. Minimize the size of the gel slice by removing extra agarose.
Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg or approximately 100 μl). For example, add 300 μl of Buffer QG to each 100 mg of gel. For >2% agarose gels, add 6 volumes of Buffer QG. The maximum amount of gel slice per spin column is 400 mg; for gel slices >400 mg use more than one MinElute column.
Incubate at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). To help dissolve gel, mix by vortexing the tube every 2–3 min during the incubation. IMPORTANT: Solubilize agarose completely. For >2% gels, increase incubation time.
After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). Note: If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 μl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The color of the mixture will turn to yellow. The adsorption of DNA to the membrane is efficient only at pH ≤7.5. Buffer QG contains a pH indicator which is yellow at pH ≤7.5 and orange or violet at higher pH, allowing easy determination of the optimal pH for DNA binding.
Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix by inverting the tube several times. For example, if the agarose gel slice is 100 mg, add 100 μl isopropanol. Do not centrifuge the sample at this stage.
Place a MinElute column in a provided 2 ml collection tube in a suitable rack.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the MinElute column, and centrifuge for 1 min. For maximum recovery, transfer all traces of sample to the column. The maximum volume of the column reservoir is 800 μl. For sample volumes of more than 800 μl, simply load and spin again.
Discard the flow-through and place the MinElute column back in the same collection tube.
Add 500 μl of Buffer QG to the spin column and centrifuge for 1 min.
Discard the flow-through and place the MinElute column back in the same collection tube.
To wash, add 750 μl of Buffer PE to the MinElute column and centrifuge for 1 min.
Discard the flow-through and centrifuge the MinElute column for an additional 1 min at ≥10,000 x g.
Place the MinElute column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 10 μl of Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of the membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min.
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.

7) Determination of the basic resistance of kanamycin
Kanamycin was prepared in water at 0µg/mL、5µg/mL、10µg/mL、15µg/mL、20µg/mL and stored at -20℃ in 10-µL aliquots. An aliquot was thawed as needed and used once without refreezing.
Equivalently draw the cyanobacterium at logarithmic growth stage and inoculate in BG-11 liquid medium containing kanamycin with all above concentration respectively, the cyanobacterium solution was cultured under the optimum conditions for one week and observation of growth status was carried out.
It is determined that the cell of cyanobacterium cannot resist certain concentration of kanamycin if no algae community were found after one week of culture. Basic kanamycin resistance test of Microcystis aeruginosa shows that the algae cannot resist concentration of 5μg/mL and above on BG11. Therefore, we choose 10-15μg/mL kanamycin for screening after shuttle plasmid pPKE2 containing modified GvpA1 gene is transformed into microcysitis aeruginosa.
8) Transformation of microcysis
Microcysis (FACHB-854) was cμLtured in BG-11 medium until OD730 reached 0.25-0.35 which is measured with a spectrophotometer.
