Despite this, the potential of chloroplast transformation is currently underexplored, due to it being time-consuming and costly. It is further hindered by the lack of standardised genetic parts available. We are developing biological methods and open-source hardware to remove these bottlenecks and building a library of modular genetic components for Chlamydomonas chloroplast.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION style="background-color: rgba(120,168,127,0.7)"><DIV class="container" style:=""><H2 style="font-family:Montserrat ; text-align: center">Introduction</H2><P>The <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">traditional</SPAN> approach to <B>production of recombinant proteins</B> in bacteria is significantly <B>limited</B>, because bacteria lack most post-translational modifications, and are likely to produce proteins as insoluble aggregates. On the other hand, mammalian expression systems have poor expression yields, require complex media and growth conditions, and are very sensitive to contamination with pathogens.</P><P>The use of microalgae chloroplasts as an <B>alternative expression system</B> solves most of these issues and offers many other advantages. Microalgae chloroplasts have very efficient protein expression. They also have a range of post-translational modification pathways, and possess chaperones and disulfide isomerases, which allow for the correct folding of multi-component proteins. Unlike in higher plants, metabolic energy in microalgae is not directed towards maintaining complex differentiated structures, further enhancing transgene expression (which can total up to 30-50% of a cell’s dry biomass).</P><P>In addition to the outstanding transgene yields, microalgae are also very <B>amenable to farming</B> worldwide and outside of labs, as autotrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic growing conditions are all possible. They have a generally-acceptable-as-safe (GRAS) status and store well. Such properties render microalgae chloroplasts an interesting chassis for production of edible vaccines and virus-like particles. These can be used in developing countries, where classical vaccines are unaffordable and hard to store and apply safely.</P><P>On top of providing an attractive expression platform, chloroplasts are the target of a lot of <B>research</B>, aiming to increase yields of oils for biofuels, elucidate photosynthetic machinery and improve C fixation to combat the international food crisis. However, despite the advantages, <B>chloroplast engineering is currently underexplored</B>. One of the obstacles is the time it takes (2-3 months) to achieve homoplasmy (a state in which all the copies of chloroplast DNA have been transformed are therefore stable), which is required for analysis of colonies to be performed. A further challenge is the experimental cost - for example, chloroplasts can be reliably transformed almost exclusively by biolistic devices, and commercial biolistic devices are very expensive. Finally, the lack of modular chloroplast genetic parts available makes gene cloning significantly more time-consuming and cumbersome.</P><P>The goal of our project is to <B>remove some bottlenecks</B> from chloroplast engineering, and provide grounds for future work aimed at removing more. In particular, we want to use Cas9 to promote the spread of genetic modifications across copies of the chloroplast genome and thus homoplasmy. In parallel to this, we are developing a library of standardised chloroplast genetic parts, which would facilitate chloroplast transformation both for the iGEM and wider communities. We wish to further <B>democratise microalgae biotechnology</B> by building affordable open-source hardware: a gene gun and a Chlamydomonas growth facility. Both will be available at a fraction of the cost of commercially available equivalents.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION style="background-color:#fff; text-align: center"><DIV class="container" style="color:#000"><CENTER><H2 style="font-family:Montserrat ; line-height:1.295em">Promoting Homoplasmy</H2></CENTER><P>The ultimate goal of the project is to achieve homoplasmy in Chlamydomonas chloroplasts much more quickly than the <SPAN class="darkGreen">2-3 months</SPAN> of repeated antibiotic selection currently taken — ideally, over the span of a single generation.</P><P>Our method relies on double transformation of Chlamydomonas chloroplast with a cassette-of-interest (CoI) and the <SPAN class="darkGreen">highly customisable “driver” cassette</SPAN> that we are developing. The “driver” could be easily adapted to any cassette-of-interest by changing the 20 nucleotide gRNA space (plus, if needed, homology regions 1 and 2). The organisation of the two cassettes is shown in the figure below:</P><P>After transformation, <SPAN class="darkGreen">Cas9 would repeatedly cut chloroplast genome</SPAN> copies at the desired site of insertion, thereby promoting homologous recombination (HR). The cutting would continue until the gRNA homology in all of genome copies has been disrupted, which can only result when the cassette-of-interest is used as the template for HR. Non-homologous end-joining does not occur in chloroplasts, and so would not interfere. By the end of the process, all genome copies would have the cassette-of-interest, i.e. homoplasmy would be achieved.</P><P>We are taking <SPAN class="darkGreen">safety considerations</SPAN> very seriously. The “driver” cassette would not promote its own propagation, as Cas9 would only cut the genome between homologies 1 and 2. This means that the transformed algae would not pose any danger, even if accidentally released into the environment. Moreover, it may be possible (although further testing is still needing to confirm this) to get rid of the Cas9 gene altogether, by replating the cells onto antibiotic 1 only, once homoplasmy is confirmed. This would remove the selection pressure for the “driver”, which might then be lost.</P><P>This design has been the result of discussions with many scientists in the field, safety considerations resulting from our integrated human practices and theoretical work.

We have codon-optimised many of our parts (using the software developed by Saul Purton at UCL), and are checking their functionality. Limited by the 10-week duration of the iGEM project, we are unlikely to complete all the necessary experiments to verify our Cas9 strategy, but the library would also have a standalone value and enable future work in this area.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION style="background-color: rgba(120,168,127,0.7)"><DIV class="container" style:=""><H1 style="font-family:Montserrat ; text-align: center">HARDWARE</H1><P style="text-align:center">We are developing open-source hardware which could come at <SPAN class="darkWhite">a fraction of the cost of commercially available</SPAN> equivalents, extensively documenting assembly <SPAN class="darkWhite">protocols online</SPAN> to make them accessible to researchers with little or no electronic and mechanical experience.
