Dr. Fernan Federici and Mr. Bernardo Pollak, for their advice on the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and the general feedback on our homoplasmy strategy.
Other sources of help
Prof. Saul Purton, University College London, for continuous advice in working towards a homoplasmic chloroplast transformation in Chlamydomonas
Marco Larrea Alvarez, University College London (Purton lab), for advice on working with Chlamydomonas, as well as inviting us to UCL to work through some difficulties with the system and receive feedback on what parts would be useful to the research community
Dr. Nicola Patron, Earlham Institute, for helping us with define our Cas9 strategy, and practical advice on the using CRISPR-Cas9 safely
Dr. Sarah Richardson, Ignition Genomics, for discussing our project with us.
Dr. Jim Ajioka, University of Cambridge, Department of Pathology, for discussing our project with us.

University of Cambridge, Department of Plant Sciences
Dr. Susana Sauret-Gueto, for guidance in our experimental design, and great advice on how to manage and arrange a lab for maximum efficiency
Dr. Moritz Meyer, for teaching us how to make TAP growth medium, culture Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, amplify DNA plasmids in bacteria and extract them, and performing biolistics. Also for providing some consumables, especially for biolistics.
Dr Payam Mehrshahi and Mr. Aleix Gorchs-Rivera, for all the help and advice on the molecular cloning strategies and analysis of results.
Dr. Farhat Nazir, for laboratory supervision in the second half of our project, explaining how to use devices and what to be cautious about in lab procedures
Barbara Landamore, for giving a safety training, providing standard laboratory equipment and help with technical issues and organisation in the lab
Linda Silvestri, for donating her stocks of competent cells, and helping us manage our lab consumables, hardware part orders, and funding
Gabriela Doria, for helping us to run a few experiments
Dr. Katrin Geisler, helped us with the biolistics procedure
Other sources of help
Prof. Saul Purton, University College London, for providing us a series of chloroplast transformation vectors and the TN72 Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain, as well as help with protocols and analysis of molecular cloning with Chlamydomonas
