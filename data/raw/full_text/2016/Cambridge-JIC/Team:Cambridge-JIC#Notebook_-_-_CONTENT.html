The group has elaborated on it further but then we realised it would be hard to find supervisors for that and there might be issues with working with mammalian material.

No more tedious selection rounds for 2-3 months!
                </H3><H3> In the following days we discussed with the experts in the Plant Sciences Department and dived into the literature on chloroplast transformation.

Last week we aimed for sending all the sequences for synthesis today. And do everything at once. But over the time we realise that eating an elephant requires cutting it into smaller pieces. We need to test everything to know what went wrong, we plan controls for everything and design experiments which will teach us even if the result is negative.
                </H3><H3>But we are still thinking far ahead and considering actually introducing some gene of interest by our finished system, if it works. We spend a lot of time researching into edible vaccines and virus-like particles which could have an impact in the field and it's really exciting!

An opportunity not to be missed! We joined some keen designers as well as people with other backgrounds and together we were working in the lab, had an etnographic workshop, had interesting lectures and were looking for a common language. We got a lot of interesting inputs for our human practices and got to design a few human practices projects happening later. For example we want to make discussion workshops in between students interested in synthetic biology, philosophy and journalism to bring them together to share thoughts. Hopefully we'll also go to schools to educate about synthetic biology.

We have so far considered many different designs. Initially we planned to have two plasmids - one with the Cas9 regulated by a regulatable promoter which would be only transiently expressed. The second plasmid with the gRNA under one promoter and a separate one promoter for our markers and the gene of interest. We considered luciferase of fluorescent proteins as our markers. We were struggling to find a sharp promoter and terminator functional in chloroplasts so that our gRNA has the desired length and sequence in the end. We even considered ribozymes which are capable of self-splicing of the gRNA and used in mammals.

(PLASMID DESIGN UPDATE VOL. 2)</B></H3></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV class="description"><H3> Some had too high AT content and repeats to be synthesised (primers surprisingly :D ) but we will try to amplify them from the chloroplast genome. Our plasmid design had at least 10 major changes of direction and was evolving quicker than some of us were able to track! But planning is important, right? 
                </H3><H3>Some of us have spent the afternoon learning biolistics - transforming our cells with fluorescent proteins
                </H3><H2><B>PLASMID DESIGN UPDATE VOL.2:</B></H2><H3>MARKERS</H3><H3><UL><LI>First we have abandoned the idea of marking our genes with luciferase as that would not give us quick and easily detectable response. Fluorescent proteins should be more reliable although there are troubles with expressing them in Chlamydomonas chloroplasts - well, something for us to troubleshoot with trying our 18 possible FPs!
                  </LI></UL></H3><H3>SAFETY - CAS9 REGULATION AND WAYS OF EXPRESSION</H3><H3><UL><LI>We are very concerned with safety as our design may resemble a gene drive, we want to make sure we are definitely not making one. We were considering Lac regulatable promoters, light regulated ones and also Nac2. Nac2 is still a system we consider to try - we could switch off the expression of Cas9 when needed and regulate it in case it's toxic in higher amounts by concentration of thiamin. But it is actually in the UTR and regulated by a nuclear gene which regulates a photosynthetic gene. So we need to obtain a strain which has been designed to have these pathways independent, we'd need to optimise concentrations of thyamin and design more constructs.!
                  </LI><LI>We also considered another level of safety by introducing another gRNA which would make the Cas9 to cleave itself after homoplasmy has been achieved. However as NHEJ does not exist in chloroplasts, we would also need to supply the template. Still an option! But at the moment we plan to introduce Cas9 cassette either transiently or just into one copy of DNA, not homoplasmic (we plan to try both), let it drive the propagation of our genes of interest and then be lost when we remove the selection pressure of antibiotics. A semi-stable type of integration was decided as an alternative to transient because transient may not produce enough product and be list too quickly.                    
                  </LI><LI>We are also considering delivery of the preassembled complex of gRNA and Cas9 or its parts into chloroplast by biolistics, although it might be beyond our time-scope
                  </LI><LI>Because of safety our Cas9 and gRNA were initially separated either physically or one of them was outside the homology regions so that it won't be integrated. It was because we had only one insertion site and corresponding homologies. In the current design the Cas9 and gRNA are in one construct but gRNA is targeting another region on the chloroplast genome (so that it drives expression).
                  </LI><LI>Our polycistronic design of cassette might be simpler and produce shorter DNA fragments but maybe complicated for cell processing so we decided to put separate promoters for gRNA, antibiotic resistance and Cas9 fused with FP
                  </LI></UL></H3><H3>ACTIVITY OF CAS9</H3><H3><UL><LI>We had troubles with assessing that our Cas9 is active as one of the first steps. It would be very elegant to let it drive propagation of its own cassette with markers (or changing colours of algae already transformed with a fluorescent protein), making the strain less viable in field but the same in the lab (eg. by nutrient utilisation defficiency). The best solution would be restoring functionality of some mutant strain by the cassette. But we want to avoid a gene drive at all costs. We have also considered surveyor assay. So we are still looking for ideal solutions, probably by tracking Cas9 cuts by qPCR. (or do we have a solution?)
                  </LI><LI>Our Cas9 is now fused with the fluorescent protein. It means each molecule of the FP corresponds to a molecule of Cas9. And we can supply an interesting part into the registry
                  </LI></UL></H3><H3>TYPES OF CAS9</H3><H3><UL><LI>We were also considering different versions of Cas9 - from different bacteria, expressed from nucleus targeted to chloroplast (unluckily it is probably toxic in the cytoplasm), transiently or stably expressed, and for long we were considering using nickase (which makes just single-stranded breaks and so pair of gRNAs is used to reduce off target activity by around hundreds of folds). But then we learned the toxicity is more likely because of sucking RNAs rather than cutting off-target.
                  </LI></UL></H3><H3>WORKING SYSTEM</H3><H3><UL><LI>We considered prototyping experiments on isolated chloroplasts to speed them up but at the moment we plan to transform chloroplasts in the whole Chlamydomonas
                  </LI></UL></H3><H3>INSERTION SITES</H3><H3><UL><LI>This design also enables any researcher with a prepared cassette for insertion to work with our system just by changing the gRNA (20 nucleotides) to correspond to the desired site of insetrion. We have searched different sites of insertion (homologies) and in our default modular design we have settled for far on a using the sites tried out by Prof Purton's lab (trnE2-psbH) for the driver (see picture below) and also a site which in literature is reported as producing high yields (TrnI-TrnA) for our gene of interest. Right?
                  </LI></UL></H3><H3>MODULARITY AND COMPATIBILITY</H3><H3><UL><LI>We design the system highly modular and compatible with Golden Gate so that it can be easily used and changed, it should work with any standard strain of Chlamydomonas. We are looking into possibility of maintaining our system modular by using GoldenBraid technique.
                </LI></UL></H3><H3>Well done if you got up to here! Have a look at our current design:</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-9"><H1 style="font-family:Montserrat ; font-size:24px" id="test">2nd August</H1><H3>The day of meetings
