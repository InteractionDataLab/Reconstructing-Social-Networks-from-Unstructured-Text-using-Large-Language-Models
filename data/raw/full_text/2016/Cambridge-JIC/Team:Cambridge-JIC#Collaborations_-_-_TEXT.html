COLLABORATIONS
Imperial College London
We assisted by providing Imperial iGEM with growth data from Chlamydomonas, for their computer model A.L.I.C.E. This computer model is aimed at producing a platform with the growth conditions for various different species, and ultimately for identifying possible co-cultures. Find out more here
We hope that the data we provide is especially useful for Imperial iGEM, as chlamydomonas takes significantly longer to grow that bacterial species.
The image shows a 96 well plate, with various concentration and 2 levels of 'happiness' of the same algae culture. We took 2 OD750 absorption readings a day in order to provide data for growth analysis by A.L.I.C.E
Linköping University Sweden
The Linköping University Sweden Team
The Linköping University Sweden team were also working on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with the aim to transform the nuclear genome to introduce CRISPR/cas9 technology to disrupt the metabolism pathway and make the cells more efficient for biofuels. Due to the similarity in project goals we collaborated throughout the summer.
The nature of this collaboration has taken many formats: e-mails, skype meetings and weekly reports about the week experiments. Staying up-dated in this manner has allowed for the exchange  of questions of dealing with the organism, protocol sharing and advice on different strategies. Sharing knowledge in this way, both teams managed to get a “feel for the organism” over the summer.
ABOUT US
We are a team of Cambridge undergraduates, competing for the plant synthetic biology prize in iGEM 2016.
