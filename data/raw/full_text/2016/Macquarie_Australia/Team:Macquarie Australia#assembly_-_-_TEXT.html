Digest reactions were then run according to table below at 37oC for 30 minutes followed by 80℃ for 20 minutes.
Digest reaction Plasmid Backbone
Digest reaction Part A
Digest reaction Part B
4µl linerarized plasmid backbone (25ng/µl for 100ng total)
4µl Part A (25ng/µl for 100ng total)
4µl Part B (25ng/µl for 100ng total)
4µl of Plasmid Backbone Master Mix
4µl Part A Master Mix
4µl Part B Master Mix
Ligation
2µl of digested Plasmid Backbone an equimolar amount of digested Part A (< 3µl) and an equimolar amount of digested Part B (< 3µl) were added to 1µl T4 DNA ligase buffer and 0.5µl of T4 DNA ligase. Water was added to bring the total to 10µl. Ligation was performed for 30 minutes at 16oC followed by a further period of 20 minutes at 80oC.
Transformation
Obtain competent cells from -80oC.
Defrost gently on ice. 100µl is sufficient for 2 transformations.
Add 1-10µl of plasmid DNA/ ligation mix to each tube. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
Heat shock in 42oC water bath for 30 seconds, then back on ice for 2 minutes.
Add 200µl of SOC media to each tube, and incubate in the 37oC shaker for 1 hour.
For each tube of cells, spread 50µl onto one LB plate with appropriate antibiotic, and 100µl onto a second plate, using aseptic technique. Place your plate upside-down in the 37oC incubator.
