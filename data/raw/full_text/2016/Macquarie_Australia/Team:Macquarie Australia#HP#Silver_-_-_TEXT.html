Outreach
This year Team Macquarie Australia have worked tirelessly to make synthetic biology an interesting and accessible topic for members of the community. Through numerous outreach activities we have captured the interest of the community and have established a dialogue with the general public about synthetic biology. We have succeeded in engaging a number of different groups including farmers, high school students and undergraduates from both scientific and non-scientific backgrounds.
