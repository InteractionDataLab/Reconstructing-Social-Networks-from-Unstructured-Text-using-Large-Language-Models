Overview
The rapid progression of synthetic biology is providing novel solutions to challenges faced by humankind in a wide variety of fields. Despite this, both public understanding and engagement in this topic are largely neglected. Our goal at Macquarie University is to make synthetic biology available to everyone. To do this we have not only reached out to the community through various educational and engagement programs but we have also integrated their feedback into the design of a portable and renewable hydrogen-producing device.
