Steering away from the confines of the laboratory, the Macquarie University 2016 team headed out into regional NSW to interview various agri-business owners operating entirely off-the-grid. Our aim was to understand their needs and concerns, whilst integrating their feedback into the design of our very own sustainable energy producing system,“The Living Battery”. A system that imparts E. coli with the ability to synthesise hydrogen gas as a renewable energy source. Our conversations with the farmers and 4WD enthusiasts brought elements of portability, low maintenance and ease of use to the designs. We called upon advice from experts within the fields of biotechnology and microbiology to address biofilm formation and potential contamination issues caused by the E. coli cells.
