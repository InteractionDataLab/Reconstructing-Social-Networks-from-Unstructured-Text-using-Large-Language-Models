Macquarie iGEM 2016
We're building on the work of last year's Macquarie University iGEM team by transforming E. coli with the genes required to complete the Chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway and create Photosystem II in this bacterial species. These systems will allow for the use of solar energy to split water into positively-charged hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen. Our next goal is then to combine the hydrogen ions and electrons produced in this hydrolytic process in a hydrogenase enzyme complex in order to produce hydrogen gas.
