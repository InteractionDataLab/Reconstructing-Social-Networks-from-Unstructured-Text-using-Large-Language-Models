Undergraduate Research Student Poster Showcase
Members of the 2016 Macquarie iGEM team had chance to promote their research and the unique opportunity that is iGEM. We presented a preliminary version of our research poster at the undergraduate student poster showcase.
Explaining the concept and scientific principles behind synthetic biology, by no means a simplistic endeavour, to students and academics without a scientific background was an intriguing experience. It also carried a certain level of responsibility – telling the general public about manipulating living things can evoke a very strong response.
It was a great opportunity to put synthetic biology and the amazing possibilities it presents in the spotlight. We were able to promote iGEM as a driver of new ideas and a possibility for the scientists of tomorrow to get a real opportunity to be involved in new, exciting scientific research. We spoke to fellow science undergraduates about the possibility that they themselves could become a part of the Macquarie iGEM team in coming years – and they amazing opportunities that would be on offer if they did.
We were particularly excited to see that, when we drew a large crowd and were busy explaining concepts to some individuals, other individuals who had already spoken to us were explaining to others who came to have a look. It was extremely exciting to see people getting enthusiastic about our project and engaging in current science.
The undergraduate showcase was a fantastic opportunity for Team Macquarie to practice consolidating the diverse elements of the project into a coherent whole. Poster besides, we even got a chance to practice presenting our research, an invaluable experience we hope will come in handy for the International Giant Jamboree.
