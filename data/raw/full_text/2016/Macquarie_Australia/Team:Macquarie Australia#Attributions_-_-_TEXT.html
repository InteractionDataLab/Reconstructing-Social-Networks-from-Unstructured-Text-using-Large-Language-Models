The 2016 Macquarie University iGEM would like to thank Macquarie University as a whole, as well as all of our advisors and supporters from the Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences (CBMS) who have provided us with laboratory space, materials and our amazing technician. We would also like to thank the Macquarie University iGEM teams from 2013 through to 2015 for all that they have contributed to this project;
2013 Macquarie Australia:
Designed and built single gene parts of the Chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway
Characterized ChlD and Plastocyanin
2014 Macquarie Australia:
Built composite parts for the Chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway
Repaired the ChlD (missing 50bp, but still functional)
Characterized ChlI1 and ChlD (new) with purified ChlH from Prof. Willow’s group
Characterized GUN4 binding of PPIX
2015 Macquarie Australia:
Designed and built single gene parts (small composite parts) of Photosystem II
Built ChlH biobrick
Characterized ChlM
Improved the characterization of ChlD
Modelled the PPIX production from ALA
Modelled the production of hydrogen gas by photosystem II/hydrogenase combination
We have expanded on that work this year by furthering the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway and photosystem II assembly as well as adding the hydrogenase pathway.
Students
We had a large cohort this year who were divided between eight main teams. These teams included; The Chlorophyll Biosynthesis Team, who worked on constructing the ‘super operon’ and ‘mega operon’ and succeeded with proving function of the super operon; The Photosystem II Team, who worked tirelessly in the lab, ligating together parts to make up the five operons of photosystem II and then operons; The Hydrogenase Team, who have been working on designing and constructing biobrick parts for the hydrogenase pathway in our system; The Modelling Team, who modelled the chlorophyll production from ALA as well as building on last year’s model of protoporphyrin IX in a hemH mutant of E. coli; The Interlab Team, who worked with remarkable efficiency to provide results to iGEM to contribute to the international lab study (only 5 weeks after our team formed!); The Human Practices team, who organised not only our public outreach activities, but also all communications with Australian farmers and our integration practices; The lab support team, who provided the 4 lab teams with endless supplies of agar plates, gels, LB media, buffers and enthusiasm; and finally, the Wiki Team, without whom we would have no documentation of our results. We would like to give a special thanks to Aashray, Manruka and Prabhjot who have devoted countless hours to editing, coding and photo shopping the various write ups and diagrams for our wiki.
Instructors and Advisors
Our team would like to say a special thanks to our instructors and advisors:
Dr. Louise Brown for her constant guidance in the laboratory and her input towards all areas of our project.
Professor Robert Willows for his invaluable laboratory input and assistance with the modelling project.
Dr. Paul Jaschke for his invaluable input into our project, particularly his help redesigning faulty parts and input into our presentation.
Professor Nicki Packer for her help towards funding our project.
Dr. Jennifer Hallinan for her helpful input and continuous support.
Edward Moh for constantly pushing us towards success, for his endless hours spent in the lab and answering any and all of our questions about the project.
Michael Gibbs for supervising the Photosystem II Team and answering any question put forward by our team members.
Thi Huynh for her amazing dedication and her determination towards seeing our team succeed. She has worked tirelessly in the lab, as well as proving a never ending source of inspiration.
Elizabeth Daniel who has been a supporter of the whole iGEM project this year. In particular, her help with the hydrogenase sub project has been extremely valuable.
Additional Acknowledgements
Our team would additionally like to thank the following people and institutions for their support:
Professor Helena Nevalainen for her invaluable input towards our design of ‘The Living Battery’.
Mark Tran for the constant supervision in the labs and his encouragement towards our project.
Dominic Logel who has helped in all areas of the project. His help with modelling in particular was very much appreciated.
Dr. Liette Vending who grew colourful E. coli cells for our displays at the Macquarie University ‘Taster’ Day.
The Farmers involved in the integration project: Linda Ivey – Mimosa Eco Retreat, Allan Dixon – Clyde Berry River Farm, Tony James – 4WD Enthusiast, Shannon Husit and Amander Anderson – Rooster Rescue Clyde River.
Professor Ian Paulsen has helped our team this year by presenting our project and synthetic biology to the general public at the Sydney Powerhouse museum. This allowed our project to reach thousands of people from the general public as the exhibition continued for serval weeks. Dr Paulsen also helped our team this year by providing us with valuable tools to develop our skills on presenting scientific research.
Dr Natalie Curach who presented our project and synthetic biology to the general public at the Powerhouse Museum.
Our fellow iGEM teams who have been involved in collaborating with us; Singapore NTU, Paris Bettencourt and Pretoria UP South Africa.
Thomas Rose (a 2015 iGEM participant) for his help editing the 3D model of our design and providing the resources to 3D print it.
Natasha Delgado (also a member of the 2015 team) for her input and advice, particularly in the dry lab groups.
Lachlan Mccubbin (a 2015 iGEM participant) for his help with Human Practices endevaours.
Softwares including Photoshop CC 2015.5, was a program used to make raw diagrams and edit photos- no copyright images were used on this wiki. Specific commercial Brusheezy brushes were used to aid the creation of heading banner artworks.
