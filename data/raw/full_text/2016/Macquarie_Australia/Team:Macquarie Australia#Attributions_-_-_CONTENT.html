We would also like to thank the Macquarie University iGEM teams from 2013 through to 2015 for all that they have contributed to this project;
<UL>
2013 Macquarie Australia:

<LI>Designed and built single gene parts of the Chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway</LI><LI>Characterized ChlD and Plastocyanin</LI>
2014 Macquarie Australia:
<LI>Built composite parts for the Chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway</LI><LI>Repaired the ChlD (missing 50bp, but still functional)</LI><LI>Characterized ChlI1 and ChlD (new) with purified ChlH from Prof. Willow’s group</LI><LI>Characterized GUN4 binding of PPIX</LI>
2015 Macquarie Australia:
<LI>Designed and built single gene parts (small composite parts) of Photosystem II</LI><LI>Built ChlH biobrick</LI><LI>Characterized ChlM</LI><LI>Improved the characterization of ChlD</LI><LI>Modelled the PPIX production from ALA</LI><LI>Modelled the production of hydrogen gas by photosystem II/hydrogenase combination</LI></UL>

We have expanded on that work this year by furthering the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway and photosystem II assembly as well as adding the hydrogenase pathway.</FONT><H1><FONT face="Arial"><CENTER><SPAN style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 23pt">Students</SPAN></CENTER></FONT></H1><FONT face="Corbel" font="" style="line-height:1.5" font="" size="3" color="#404040">We had a large cohort this year who were divided between eight main teams. These teams included; The Chlorophyll Biosynthesis Team, who worked on constructing the ‘super operon’ and ‘mega operon’ and succeeded with proving function of the super operon; The Photosystem II Team, who worked tirelessly in the lab, ligating together parts to make up the five operons of photosystem II and then operons; The Hydrogenase Team, who have been working on designing and constructing biobrick parts for the hydrogenase pathway in our system; The Modelling Team, who modelled the chlorophyll production from ALA as well as building on last year’s model of protoporphyrin IX in a hemH mutant of <I>E. coli</I>; The Interlab Team, who worked with remarkable efficiency to provide results to iGEM to contribute to the international lab study (only 5 weeks after our team formed!); The Human Practices team, who organised not only our public outreach activities, but also all communications with Australian farmers and our integration practices; The lab support team, who provided the 4 lab teams with endless supplies of agar plates, gels, LB media, buffers and enthusiasm; and finally, the Wiki Team, without whom we would have no documentation of our results. We would like to give a special thanks to Aashray, Manruka and Prabhjot who have devoted countless hours to editing, coding and photo shopping the various write ups and diagrams for our wiki.</FONT><H1><FONT face="Arial"><CENTER><SPAN style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 23pt">Instructors and Advisors</SPAN></CENTER></FONT></H1><FONT face="Arial" font="" size="4" color="#808080"><CENTER>Our team would like to say a special thanks to our instructors and advisors:</CENTER></FONT><FONT face="Corbel" font="" style="line-height:1.5" font="" size="3" color="#404040"><B>Dr. Louise Brown</B> for her constant guidance in the laboratory and her input towards all areas of our project.<B>Professor Robert Willows</B> for his invaluable laboratory input and assistance with the modelling project.<B>Dr. Paul Jaschke</B> for his invaluable input into our project, particularly his help redesigning faulty parts and input into our presentation.<B>Professor Nicki Packer</B> for her help towards funding our project.<B>Dr. Jennifer Hallinan</B> for her helpful input and continuous support.<B>Edward Moh</B> for constantly pushing us towards success, for his endless hours spent in the lab and answering any and all of our questions about the project.<B>Michael Gibbs</B> for supervising the Photosystem II Team and answering any question put forward by our team members.<B>Thi Huynh</B> for her amazing dedication and her determination towards seeing our team succeed.
