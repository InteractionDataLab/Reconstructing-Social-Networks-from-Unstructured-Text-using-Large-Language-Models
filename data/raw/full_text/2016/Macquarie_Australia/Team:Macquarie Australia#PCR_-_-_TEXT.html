PCR
General mastermix recipe:
4 µL of 5x phusion buffer
0.4 µL dNTPs
0.6 µL of DMSO
0.2 µL of polymerase
11.8 µL of water
To this mixture, add:
1 µL of forward primer
1 µL of reverse primer
1 µL of template
Total volume = 20 µL
PCR settings:
A general program for PCR is as follows:
Initial denaturation at 98oC for 30 seconds
Followed by 30 repeats of:
Denaturation – 98oC for 10 seconds
Annealing – 60oC for 10 seconds
Extension – 72oC for 2 minutes
Final extension – 72oC for 10 minutes
