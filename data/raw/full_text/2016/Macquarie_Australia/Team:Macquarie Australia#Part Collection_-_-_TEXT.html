This year Macquarie Australia submits 14 parts as a collection. Together these collection of parts [BBa_K1998000 - BBa_K1998014] allows us to express the genes of the photosynthetic pathway within E.coli to produce hydrogen from sunlight. The collection is split into three parts.
The first collection of parts [BBa_K1998000 , BBa_K1998001 & BBa_K1998013] are those within the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway and lead to the production of chlorophyll a.
The second collection of parts [BBa_K1998002 - BBa_K1998008 & BBa_K1998014] are 17 genes that allow for  the assembly of Photosystem II in E.coli. Photosystem II generates oxygen and electrons via the oxidation of water molecules.
The last collection of parts [BBa_K1998009 - BBa_K1998012] allow for the generation of hydrogen gas using hydrogenase. This will enable the production of hydrogen gas in a clean and sustainable way which could be used as a future energy source.
