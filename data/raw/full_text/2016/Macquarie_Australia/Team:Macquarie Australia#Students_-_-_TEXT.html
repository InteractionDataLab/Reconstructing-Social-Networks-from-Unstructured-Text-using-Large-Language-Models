Team Macquarie Australia
We are a team of 33 students from Sydney NSW, Australia. As far as iGEM goes, we are a big group of students, and as a team we have had to work collectively together to deliver our project for 2016. Our team’s participation in the iGEM competition runs parallel to the coursework in the Biomolecular Capstone unit offered at Macquarie University, which limited the time available to us. The team’s work on the project began in August of 2016 and still continues whilst others have been working all year. As such, we are not your typical iGEM team.  Like the Macquarie Australia teams before us, we have found our own way of doing things to complete our project in time. We are excited and proud to deliver Team Macquarie_Australia’s 2016 iGEM Project.
