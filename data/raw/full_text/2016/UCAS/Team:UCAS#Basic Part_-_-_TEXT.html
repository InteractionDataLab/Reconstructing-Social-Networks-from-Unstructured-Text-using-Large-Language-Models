Best Basic Parts
As tetracycline (Tc) degrading enzymes lies in the core of our project, we tested various kinds of candidate enzyme. Through qualitative experiments, we found that the most effective enzyme to degrade Tc is TetX. We then further comprehensively characterized this enzyme, and documented it in our part registry page, and has its plasmid submitted. Our key achievements include measuring the Km and kcat value of this enzyme, getting its kinetic curve, calculating its turnover number.
The enzyme has neither been used nor submitted/used by a previous, so we believe this part is both a pioneer and model for antibiotic degradation and have the potential to compete for a Best Basic Part.
