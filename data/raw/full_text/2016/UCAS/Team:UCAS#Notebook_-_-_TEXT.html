Circuit Construction Group
14th August ‘pTet + RBS + GFP + DT’ was assembled on pSB1A3
16th August ‘pT7 + RBS+ GFP + DT’ was assembled on pSB1K3. We found the E.coli bearing this plasmid is green when excited
27th August ‘pTet + T7 RNAP’ was assembled on pSB1C3
29th August ‘tetX-GFP’ was constructed by overlapping PCR
30th August ‘tetX-GFP’ was assembled on pSB1C3, and was sent to be sequenced for DNA mutation
4th September We found the ‘pTet + T7 RNAP’ plasmids we extracted lost half of pTet, when cloning ‘pTet + T7 RNAP + DT’
11th September ‘pTet + RBS + tetX-GFP + DT’ and ‘pT7 + RBS + tetX-GFP + DT’ were assembled on pSB1C3
12th September ‘T7 RNAP + DT + pT7 + RBS + GFP + DT’ was assembled on pSB1C3
16th September ‘T7 RNAP + DT + pT7 + RBS + tetX-GFP + DT’ was assembled on pSB1C3
20th September We found that when amplified in the E.coli, the plasmids containing ‘T7 RNAP + DT+pT7 + RBS+GFP + DT’ and ‘T7 RNAP + DT + pT7 + RBS + tetX-GFP + DT’ would lose the parts between two DTs. The plasmids extracted from the E.coli were the mixture of plasmids carrying ‘T7 RNAP + DT + pT7 + RBS + GFP + DT’ and plasmids carrying ‘T7 RNAP + DT’ or the mixture of ‘T7 RNAP + DT + pT7 + RBS + tetX-GFP + DT’ plasmids and ‘T7 RNAP + DT’ plasmids. We thought it was because the recombination between two DTs. Thus, we decided to change the terminator of T7 RNAP.
22nd September ‘ptet + T7 RNAP’ was assembled on pSB1A3, and was sent to be sequenced for whether half of the pTet was lost
24th September ‘Ter(BBa_B0013) + pT7 + RBS + GFP + DT’ and ‘Ter(BBa_B0013) + pT7 + RBS + tetX-GFP + DT’ were assembled on pSB1C3.
26th September ‘pTet + RBS + GFP + DT’ and ‘pT7 + RBS + GFP + DT’ were cloned to pSB1C3
29th September ‘ptet + T7 RNAP + Ter + pT7 + RBS + GFP + DT’ and ‘ptet + T7 RNAP + Ter + pT7 + RBS + tetX-GFP + DT’ were assembled on pSB1C3
2nd October ‘pTet + RBS + GFP + DT’, ‘pTet + RBS + tetX-GFP + DT’, ‘ptet + T7 RNAP + Ter + pT7 + RBS + GFP + DT’ and ‘ptet + T7 RNAP + Ter + pT7 + RBS + tetX-GFP + DT’ were cotransformed with a low-copy plasmid expressing tetR
3rd October The fluorescence intensity data of ‘pTet + RBS + GFP + DT’, ‘pTet + RBS + tetX-GFP + DT’, ‘pT7 + RBS + GFP + DT’, ‘pT7 + RBS + tetX-GFP + DT’ was got
