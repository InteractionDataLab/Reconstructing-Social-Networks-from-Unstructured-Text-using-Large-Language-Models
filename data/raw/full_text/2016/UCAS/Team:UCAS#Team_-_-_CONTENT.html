In our project, I am in charge of finding the most effective antibiotic degrading enzymes. Besides academics, I am a music lover who enjoy singing and playing the clarinet, also active in Students' Union and Model UN.

                                    I am also a campus journalist, having interviewed university president, academicians as well as ordinary students with unique stories.
                                    I take the part of modeling and hardware designing and some lab work in our team, as a social role who push the teammates together and forward and prepare the laboratory consumables.

                                    Biologists aim to learn as much as possible about the secrets of life, and apply the knowledge to cure diseases, control pollution, develop new energy, etc.
                                    Among all the sub-disciplines of biology, I find molecular biology to be the most attractive one.
                                    It is the reactions between different biological molecular in cells that determine what we are.
                                    With the development of molecular biology, now we can partly regulate those reactions to achieve certain purposes using synthetic biology.
                                    The iGEM is a pioneer of this field.
                                    I hope I can create my own genetically engineered machines and have a good time here.

                                    Synthetic biology is a highly interdisciplinary field that allows individuals from a multitude of backgrounds to come together and produce novel systems, or reinvent preexisting ones, trying to make more or less contributions to the world.
