Overview
This summer, we constructed a number of parts, which include enzyme related parts and a collection of antitoxins and toxins. We also have 13 functional parts submitted.
Favorite Part
Among the parts we submitted, TetX is fully characterized and we believe it has the potential to compete for the Best Basic Part (See our wiki page: Best Basic Part ).
Toxin ParE is sufficiently toxic and can be effectively neutralized by antitoxin ParD. This Mycobacterium tuberculosis-originated TA module is also orthogonal to the TA modules in our chassis organism. We believe this composite part is competitive enough for a Best Composite Part (See our wiki page: Best Composite Part ).
Useful Pats
In our project, we also tested 11 pairs of toxins and antitoxins, most of them are functional. It is estimated that bacteria harbors thousands of TA modules both on their genomes and plasmids. The actual number may be more than that. What is more, TA modules are commonly used in iGEM Competition to build biocontainment systems or ‘kill-switch’. So our work shall provide an abundant pool for future teams. Based on these, we believe these parts are competitive for Best Part Collection (See our wiki page: Best Part Collection ).
