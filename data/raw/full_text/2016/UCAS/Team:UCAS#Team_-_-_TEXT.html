Student
Hey, guys! I am Mu Zepeng.                                     As a biology major, I was instantly hooked to synthetic biology when I first heard about such concepts as genetic circuits.                                     In the past year, I have been one of the student leaders of our team.                                     I am also in charge of the screening of toxin-antitoxin pairs of for our kill-switch.                                     I am also interested in Computer Programing.
I AM Zhuoning Zou, a junior majoring in Biology Science. I have been fascinated by natural and artificial design of life since learning synthetic biology. I dreamt about unlocking more mysteries of life at molecular level, like decoding genetic information or exploring the rule of genetic regulation. In our project, I am in charge of finding the most effective antibiotic degrading enzymes. Besides academics, I am a music lover who enjoy singing and playing the clarinet, also active in Students' Union and Model UN.
I am a current junior seeking to understand life as chemistry.                                     Experiences at labs focused on waste water treatment, nano materials, electrochemistry and synthetic biology give me a special vision and broad interest.                                     I am also a campus journalist, having interviewed university president, academicians as well as ordinary students with unique stories.                                     I take the part of modeling and hardware designing and some lab work in our team, as a social role who push the teammates together and forward and prepare the laboratory consumables.
My major is biology, which, I think, has the closest relationship to the human being among all subjects.                                     Biologists aim to learn as much as possible about the secrets of life, and apply the knowledge to cure diseases, control pollution, develop new energy, etc.                                     Among all the sub-disciplines of biology, I find molecular biology to be the most attractive one.                                     It is the reactions between different biological molecular in cells that determine what we are.                                     With the development of molecular biology, now we can partly regulate those reactions to achieve certain purposes using synthetic biology.                                     The iGEM is a pioneer of this field.                                     I hope I can create my own genetically engineered machines and have a good time here.
My name is HUANG Jianyi and I’m a sophomore at UCAS.                                     As a biology major, I’m curious about the structure of various proteins and the corresponding properties.                                     I’m obsessed with the precision and efficiency with which thousands of reactions perform in a cell.                                     The secrets of life appeal great to me, life in labs also seems attractive and interesting and I’m hoping to one day discover what I’m curious about.                                     Out of biology, I’m a helpless sports fanatic and a music lover.
Hi there.                                     I am Ruiling Cai , a biology major student in my second year at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.                                     iGEM is interesting to me since there is much room for creativity and diversity.                                     Synthetic biology is a highly interdisciplinary field that allows individuals from a multitude of backgrounds to come together and produce novel systems, or reinvent preexisting ones, trying to make more or less contributions to the world.
I am Walter, modeler and programmer in our team.                                     Majoring in chemistry, I am interested in interdisciplinary studies, therefore I participate in projects of many fields, including optics, applied mathematics, machine learning beside iGEM.                                     I was fascinated by the concept of synthetic biology and genetic circuit, it is like doing something as God does.
I am a sophomore at UCAS, majoring in Biology.                                     I have gotten into synthetic biology since a period of lab life in a molecular biology lab whose research projects are related to virus.                                     I hope to make the best of synthetic biology to create something crazy but can make a difference to people’s life, and I think iGEM seems like a perfect beginning.                                     In my free time, I like to make acquaintance with peers.                                     I am the president of the Undergraduate Student Union of UCAS.                                     Besides, I really enjoy breaking--- a kind of street dancing.
I am Xu Yue, junior student at UCAS.                                     I am majoring at Materials Science and Engineering and I am the only engineering student at team.                                     I love to read the blueprint and realize it.                                     What IGEM attracts me most is to collaborate with peer students.                                     No matter how crazy your idea might be, we can sit around the table, think it over and discuss thoroughly.                                     Aside from lab work, I try to cook.                                     After all, reading a recipe is not much different from reading an experiment protocol.

I am Liu Ye and I am a junior student in the school of life science.                                     I focused on the experiment to select the best degrading enzyme.                                     I also gained more confidence of myself while doing human practice.                                     It's wonderful to work with group of students sharing the same interests.                                     Thanks for all the team members working together.                                     In my spare time, I like reading literature and writing poems or novels.
My name is Yushan Liu, I am a sophomore in UCAS, who is responsible for helping with the selection of TA system.                                     iGEM has provided me with work portion and taught me to keep an open mind to different aspects of science and medicine, besides, it creates opportunities for me to meet other teams’ members, so I can learn to see issues from many new perspectives.                                     I am very interested in health care fields in biology filed, I hope to major in biology in the future and learn further on this aspect .                                     In my free time, I love playing piano and watching TV plays.
I’m Yueren Jiang, a sophomore major in Chemistry in UCAS.                                     I was drawn to iGEM because of the opportunity for allowing young students to work on synthetic biology experiments.                                     In some way, I’m bored with empty theories without experimental evidence, so I hope I can learn some real skills to broaden my vision and knowledge and make more friends.                                     This summer, I fully immersed myself in the TA module experiments, one of the most important parts of our project.                                     Through the process, I have learned a lot.                                     Instead of feeling content, I’m worried, because I know time is really limited and there are still some highlights need to be added to our project.                                     Anyway, I hope we get good achievements in this game.
My name is Li Yongming.                                     I am a junior student major in Chemistry in UCAS.                                     I am interested in Biology and have learned some biological courses.                                     Doing experiments and research is a good opportunity to make me have a better understanding of synthetic biology.                                     In the summer, I have been in charge of some experiments of selecting several potential enzymes which can degrade antibiotic.                                     I also did some human practice to make the public know more about antibiotic and its possible harm of misuse and overuse.                                     I have learned much since we began our project.                                     It is a great and unforgettable experience to work with my teammates.
