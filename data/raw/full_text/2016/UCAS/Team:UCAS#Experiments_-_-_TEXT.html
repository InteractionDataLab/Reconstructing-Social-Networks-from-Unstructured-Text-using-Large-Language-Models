Protocols
Below you can find two kinds of protocols available to download:
General Protocols entail protocols for routine molecular cloning experiments used by almost every iGEM team including transformation, co-transformation, colony PCR, Golden Gate, Gibson Assembly, agarose gel electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, induction of protein expression and quantification of protein.
Protocols Specifically Used in Our Project entail project-specific protocols used by us this year. Some of them are developed by our team, and some may be valuable for future team who want to repeat our experiments or who is to be performing similar experiments. Protocols include solid phase extraction for Tc, LC-MS analysis for Tc, kinetic analysis of enzymes, measurement of growth curve, SEM, protein separation and protein purification.
