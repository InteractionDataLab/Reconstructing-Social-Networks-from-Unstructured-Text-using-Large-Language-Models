Safety in Design
For cloning ease, we utilized the laboratory E. coli strain DH5ùõº as our chassis. The parts we built would then be tested primarily in our cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Both organisms are non-pathogenic and do not survive well outside of laboratory or highly maintained conditions. If we are able to upscale production, we plan to build a photobioreactor to grow our CyanoLogic cyanobacteria. Compared to traditional open ponds systems, this method provides a more contained system.
Safety in the lab
Prior to gaining entrance to our laboratory spaces, all members were required to become certified in the following online trainings through CSU‚Äôs Environmental and Health Services Department and CSU‚Äôs Research and Scholarly Ethics Department: Hazardous Waste Generator Training, BSL1 and BSL2 Training, and Institutional Responsible Conduct of Research Training.
We followed standard safety procedures required for Biosafety Level 1 facilities including wearing proper PPE equipment (gloves, safety glasses, and lab coats) for Biosafety Level 1 facilities. As for generated waste, we autoclave all biohazardous waste before it is placed in biohazardous waste bins to be disposed. Our lab work also adhered to CSU‚Äôs biosafety guidelines.
