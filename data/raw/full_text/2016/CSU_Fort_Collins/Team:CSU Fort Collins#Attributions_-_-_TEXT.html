Our advisors
We’d like to express our gratitude towards our advisors and their labs. Overall, they have all helped us gain a deeper understanding of synthetic biology and pushed us to be great scientists at the beginning of our careers.
Dr. Christie Peebles, professor in the College of Engineering at CSU, acted as our primary advisor with her expertise in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6808 and allowed us to utilize her laboratory space. She also helped us apply for the Building with Biology kit and arrange its usage at the Larimer County Farmer’s Market. Her PhD candidate students, Allison Zimont and Jacob Sebasta, assisted us with selecting potential light induced promoters for our logic gate, Ligase Cycling Reactions (LCR), and cyanobacteria transformation protocols.
Dr. Tom Santangelo, professor in the College of Natural Sciences at CSU, allowed us to utilize his laboratory space. His lab manager, Hallie Febvre, for her cloning advice.
Dr. Claudia Gentry-Weeks, Associate Biosafety Officer and professor in the College of Veterinary and Medical Biomedical Sciences at CSU, helped us navigate through biosafety concerns.
