Parafilm
Electrophoresis chamber and power source
SYBR Green
Loading Dye
DNA Ladder
PCR Samples
Procedure
Using a balance, mass out 0.5 gram of agarose (for 1% gel, for 2% mass out 1.0 gram). Mix this with 50 mL of TAE 1X Buffer.
Microwave the mixture, mixing by swirling intermittently, until all the agarose is dissolved and the mixture is homogeneous and clear (about 2 minutes).
Pour the mixture into a gel plate and insert a correctly-sized comb (8, 10, etc. lanes). Allow to cool and solidify on the benchtop.
Mix your samples on a piece of parafilm. Use 10 μL of the appropriate DNA Ladder (1 kb, 100 bp, 2 log, etc.) combined with 1 μL SYBR Green/DMSO in the first lane. For all samples, mix 10 μl of sample and 2 μL of SYBR Green/Dye Mixture.
Place gel in tray into the gel electrophoresis apparatus - wells should be close to the negative (conventionally black) end. Fill apparatus with 1X TAE until the gel is completely submerged. Do not overfill - there is a guide sticker on the apparatus which marks the max fill line.
Load 10 μL of each sample into the appropriate wells.
Connect wiring and run gel electrophoresis at 110 V for 1 hour.
Analyze gel in UV light and see if samples match the expected size using the ladder as a guide.

Agar
1 L glass bottle
Stir bar
3 M NaOH
1 M Tes-NaOH (pH 8.0)
Trace metals mix 1000X solution
Antibiotics (optional)
1 sleeve of plates (25)
Procedure
Dissolve 7 g of Agar powder in 700 mL of deionized water in a 1 L glass bottle with blue cap (will make enough for 1 sleeve of plates).
Place a piece of autoclave tape over the orange cap and onto the neck of the glass bottle.  Label the bottle (media, initials, date)
Autoclave the mixture in the bottle on the liquids cycle (3 or 4).  See Sterile Technique and Autoclaving Protocol for more details.  This procedure takes 45-60 minutes
While cooling, put the bottle on the stir plate and stir the agar to prevent it from hardening prematurely.  Allow the liquid agar to cool so that you can comfortably grab the bottle with a bare hand.
Once you are able to comfortably grab the bottle for >5 sec with your bare hand, add 7ml each of BG-11 components A, B, and C 100X. Then add 700μL of trace metals mix 1000X.
pH adjust the mixture to pH of 9.0 with 3 M NaOH (use pH meter in GL 122; add approximately 10μL at a time ). Once adjusted, lock in the pH by adding 7ml of 1M Tes-NaOH. Swirl the bottle periodically to ensure proper mixing of all components.
[Optional] Add antibiotics as needed (Kanamycin, refer to table below). Allow to stir on stir plate for 1 min to mix the antibiotic with the media and to reduce bubble formation.

700µL
Meanwhile, spray down a sleeve of plates with 70% ethanol and place in laminar flow hood.  Open the sleeve and remove plates.
Starting at the bottom of the stack, open each plate and pour in agar until the bottom of the plate is covered.  Typically, 18-20 mL of agar is used per plate.  Replace the stack on top of the poured plate.
Remove the next cover.  Repeat step until you have poured all the plates. Label the plates with the appropriate colored lines on the sides of each plate.
Once the plates have set (5-15 min), turn the plates over.  The plates should sit like this for around 1 hour until they have completely cooled.
Place the plates back into the plastic with the agar side on top (upside down), seal and label bag (media, initials, date), store at 4C

Centrifuge 10 ml cells at 4000 g for 6 min.  Discard supernatant.
Re-suspend cells in 100 microliters of BG-11 and move suspension to
14 ml conical falcon tube.
Add 1 microgram of target plasmid to the suspension
Also prepare 1 control tube with no DNA
Incubate cells for 5 hrs in light at 30+ C.
Tubes should be gently shaken at ~2.5 hrs to ensure proper mixing
Plate/spread 100 uL of the mixture onto the following plate
BG-11 (no-antibiotics)- Add 100ul cell and plasmid suspension directly to the agar.   To ensure complete spreading and full contact between the cells and agar, use a bacterial spreader.
After 48 hours use the bacterial loop spreader to collect a smear of cells from the BG-11 (no-antibiotics) plate.  Perform a triple streak procedure onto a BG-11+Kan50 plate
Cover plates with surgical tape and PLACE all plates in 30+ C lighted incubator.
Single colonies should be observed in 10-14 days.
After colonies have formed, Streak single colonies on a fresh BG-11 plate with antibiotics and place back into incubator to grow.  Most protocols do this once a week for 3-4 weeks to ensure segregation of the mutation.

Grow engineered cells to an O.D of 0.5 to 0.7.
Centrifuge 2x 10mL of cells at 4000x g for 6 minutes at room temperature. Discard supernatant.
Resuspend cells in 100µL of BG-11 and move suspension to 14ml falcon tube.
Add 1µg of plasmid to each culture to be transformed. Make sure one culture has no plasmid (as a control). Note: Try to achieve a mixture with 10ng/μL of DNA concentration.
Incubate cells for 5 hours in light at 30oC. Shake gently at 2.5 hrs to ensure proper mixing.
After 5 hours, spin down cells and resuspend in 10mL of BG-11. Transfer the culture to a shake flask. Leave to grow for 24 hours.
Plate 100µL of each culture on BG-11+Ni 5.3 (20μM Ni) plates.
Cover plates with surgical tape and leave it to grow under light at 30C
Colonies should appear in 5 to 7 days.
Once colonies form, streak single colonies on both BG-11+Ni5.3 and BG11+Kan50 plates. Note he colonies with the expected insert should survive on BG-11+Ni5.3 but NOT on BG-11+Kan50.
Transfer to liquid cultures
In a 14mL falcon tube, take a swab of cells from the BG-11+Ni5.3 plate and place it in 1mL of BG-11+20μM Ni. Let it grow for 2-3 days. Note: To achieve 20µM Ni, add 0.2µL of 100mM NiSO4 per 1mL BG-11.
Once cells reach a sufficient O.D in the tubes (about 2 days), pipette all of the cells into a 50mL BG-11+20μM Ni culture. Cells should be retransferred every 6 to 7 days. Note: To achieve 20μM Ni, add 10μL of 100mM Ni to 50mL of BG-11.
