What if the bacteria in this pond could be harnessed to create biofuels?
Lights, Quorum, Action! Boolean logic is used in computer processes by stipulating necessary inputs to  produce a desired outcome. We designed a logic gate in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to optimize product  production. Utilizing the Boolean operator AND, gene expression accommodates the organism’s natural  metabolic regulation combined with the quorum sensing mechanism from Vibrio fischeri to create an  autoinduction system. With the cost of large scale production in mind, our system eliminates the need for  expensive induction molecules, such as IPTG. Under the control of light and a quorum of cells, the T7  promoter, from T7 bacteriophage, drives production of a wide range of products from biofuels to  pharmaceuticals. CyanoLogic, coming soon to a lab near you!
