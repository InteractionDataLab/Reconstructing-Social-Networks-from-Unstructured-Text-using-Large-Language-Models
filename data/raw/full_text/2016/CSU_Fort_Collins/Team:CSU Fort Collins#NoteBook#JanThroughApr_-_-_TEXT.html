January Through April
1/4/16:
Ligated b0034 and c0061
Transformed Ligated mixture
Ran PCR results on a 2% gel
1/5/16:
Digested LuxR with EcoRI and SpeI
Performed Colony PCR on transformation from the 4th
1/11/16:
slr0435 Excision from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 with PCR using Phusion(size 276 bp).
Ran PCR results on a 2% gel
Digested I0462 and  E0030 with EcoRI and  SpeI, R0062 and B0015 with EcoRI and XbaI, B0034 with SPeI and PstI, and C0061 with XbaI and PstI.
1/12/16:
Digested slr0435 and resuspended pSB1C3 with EcoRI and PstI
Ligated pSB1C3 and slr0435
Transformed ligation mixture
1/13/16:
Colony PCR performed on slr0435+pSB1C3 transformed colonies
Ran PCR results on 1% gel
Digested I0462 and  E0030 with EcoRI and  SpeI, R0062 and B0015 with EcoRI and XbaI, B0034 with SPeI and PstI, and C0061 with XbaI and PstI.
Ran on 1% gel
1/21/16:
Digested I0462 and  E0030 with EcoRI and  SpeI,  and C0061 with XbaI and PstI.
Ran on 1% gel
Phosphatase treatment
Use Antarctic Phosphatase with 10x buffer. Need 1uL to treat 1ug of DNA
Add 1uL phosphatase and 5uL 10x buffer to bring total rxn volume to 50uL
Incubate at 37C for 1 hour, and heat inactivate at 70C for 5 minutes
1/25/16:
Overnight ligated R0062 and I0462, B0034 and C0061, B0015 and E0030 at 16 C
1/25/16:
Transformed the overnight ligation mixtures
2/6/16:
PCRed out BBA_J23106 out of glycerol stock 19 using Q5 master mix 19rxns
2/9/16:
Transformed Bba_K325909 from parts kit into DH5a cels
2/11/16:
To confirm that Bba_K325909 are functioning we tried to induce expression using L-arabinose
No luminescence was produced
2/16/16:
Decided to order two gBlocks for quorum portion of the project
3/24/16:
Set up O/N cultures of K1033929, K592009 and E1010 in 5 mL of LB with 5 uL of Cm34 antibiotic
3/29/16:
Ran promoters Sll027, and LrtA in a 1% gel
Sll0027
LrtA
4/6/16:
Ran Cpcg2 on 1% gel
4/12/16:
Prepare pSB1C3 vector for Infusion
gBlocks (Quorum 1 and Quorum 2) have 15 bp homology with each other along with prefix and suffix at the entire block’s ends
Digesting the vector with XbaI will leave 16 bp homology with Quorum 1
Digesting the vector with SpeI will leave 20 bp homology with Quorum 2
Digested c0061 with SPeI and XbaI
Ran on 1% gel
4/12/16:
Reaction: PSB1C3 3.06 uL,Q1 2.5ul,Q2 1.78ul, 5x Infusion Mix 2ul, H20 .66ul
Transformation
Add 1 uL Infusion rxn to 50 uL Stellar Cells
Incubate 30 min on ice, 45 sec at 42C, 2 min on ice
Add 250 uL SOC media
1 hour outgrowth at 37C
Plate 50 uL on LB+Cam plates
37C overnight
4/18/16:
Colony PCR on 5 Qblock transformed colonies
4/19/16:
Ran PCR products from the 18th on a 1% gel
4/20/16:
Quorum Colony PCR Phusion
4/22/16:
Ran the PCR product from the 20th on a 1% gel
