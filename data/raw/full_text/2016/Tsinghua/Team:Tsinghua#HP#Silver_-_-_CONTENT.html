          As a committed and supportive member of the iGEM community, we believe in the value of
          “go beyond the lab” and devote ourselves to interacting with peers in life sciences, as
          well as lay teenagers that are fascinated by the secret of life. Through lively presentations,
           exchange of ideas and even hot debates, we inspire and illuminate each other, with pure
           curiosity for science.
          <H2 class="contentPage">The voice within</H2>
          A priceless tradition for the Tsinghua iGEM community is that once you have become an iGEMer,
           you are integrated into a welcoming community, within which crazy ideas are freely allowed
           and team members are uncontionally supported. We therefore started the Human Practice section
           by incorporating voices from previous iGEM members from Tsinghua University, and named it &quot;The
           Voice Within&quot;, because we genuinely believe their opinions are truly reflective of who we are.
           Views below were collected from three iGEM team members in the past. We truly appreciate their
           insightful input.
          &quot;Detrimental gene mutation leading to cancer has been a problem that perplex human for a long time,
           and still not solved yet. While cancer immunotherapy become hotspot and achieved a lot of progress
           recent years, there are many restrictions in this field to deal with the solid tumor. So I was really
           interested in iGEM 2016 Tsinghua’s project when I knew that they wanted to design such a surveillance
           system. It can, to some degree, cut off the road from gene mutation to cancer. I consider it a quite
           innovative idea and feel hopeful that they decided to utilize the dCas9 as a core tool to manipulate it.
           With the advances in dCas9 function and manipulation, this surveillance system can be realized in cancer
           precaution with advantages like low-cost, effective, precisely controlled and convenient.
          As a member of iGEM 2015 Tsinghua team, I feel glad to see that this team has become more mature in the
          way of thinking and realizing their projects. Even though they went through several obstacles, they work
           together and solve them together, which made the whole team grow together. I wish you a good luck, iGEM
           2016 Tsinghua team!&quot;, Xiong Sihan, Team Tsinghua 2015.
          &quot;Finding ways to surveil and respond to genetic mutations is one of the most pivotal mission for all living
           creatures along the river of evolution, also for scientists today, who have been sparing no effort in
           seeking ways to prevent and treat cancer. In addressing this challenging question, Tsinghua Team raised a
           pioneering idea of using a RNA-targeting CRISPR/Cas9 system to detect critical genetic mutations and induce
           the suicide of the mutated cells. Creating Cas9 protein with GAL4 binding ability and precise discrimination
           of normal and mutated genes are two highlights of the project. Delicate control of the whole system is
           never easy, however, Tsinghua Team has successfully proved the concept in baking yeast. The next goal may
           be mammalian systems. From my perspectives, techniques like the suvCas9 have great potential in next
           generation of cancer therapy because they could work together with the hosts’ immune system to prevent
           malignancy at the first line.&quot;, Liu Yue, Team Tsinghua 2014.
          &quot;Congratulations that you have done a really cool job! I am fascinated by what you have brought to the iGEM
           society. Surveillance is a rather important idea, that you're treating a cellular system, or your genetic
           machine, less like a pool of interactions but more like a sophisticated and well-functioning system, with
           top-down self regulation. This, I believe, will be one of the foundations for future genetic machines, and
           your delecate work will provide huge help for future iGEMers and researchers. Look so much forward to your
           presentation this year!&quot;, Wang Jiawei, Team Tsinghua 2015.

          What is synthetic biology? What can we do with synthetic biology? From the GATC of DNA, we
           guided members of the YouthBiopark Summer Camp through their first voyage into synthetic biology.
          
          Collaborating with China International Education Institute, we made Tsinghua a highlight in
           the twelve-day summer camp. Members were middle school students, barely with any background
           in molecular biology, recruited throughout China, who took a genuine interest in life
           sciences. Starting from the basic principles of molecular cloning to the infinite possibilities
           of synthetic biology, the lecture we gave pictured this exciting branch of life sciences in a
           nutshell, which was received with widened eyes and dozens of questions.
          
          The ideas planted immediately sprouted, blossomed and fruited.
          What if we identify the sex-determining gene in mosquito, and by genetic modification, make
           the progenies all male?
          
          “I’m thinking about making a bacterial sensor for PM 2.5 or other common sources of pollution...
          perhaps, when it sensed the pollution it could give a clear indication of risk, like changing
           into different colors.”
          
          We were truly impressed by the ideas they came up with, just at a first glimpse into this world.
           We discussed each of them thoroughly, dissecting every step to examine its feasibility, demonstrating
           how we can convert a fancy idea to a practical project based on the principles of synthetic biology.
           Though some of them seemed far away from reality, there were intriguing perspectives in every
           suggestion. At the end of discussion, we gave a general summary of the fields that synthetic biology
           has already influenced or even shaped: pharmaceutics, pollution management, energy, diagnostic,
           nutrition...and many other aspects in basic research.
          
          Following the idea-to-project workshop was a lab tour to catch a glimpse of the “real world” where
           all those fantastic possibilities are realized. We briefly introduced the procedure, equipment
           and materials for molecular cloning in the lab, and showed examples of genetically engineered
          organisms.
          
          Though the journey didn’t last long, it was a fruitful and memorable one. We got really encouraging
           feedbacks: “This is so cool and I’d like to explore more about synthetic biology in the future!”
           Meanwhile, we were also inspired by the ideas and comments they gave. It was a privilege to bring
           the ideas of synthetic biology to the members of the summer camp, and to see that our efforts can
           indeed make a difference and attract more people to learn about, or even fall in love with this
           branch of science.
