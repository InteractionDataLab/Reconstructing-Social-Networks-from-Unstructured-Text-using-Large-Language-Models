International communication: Attending the 4th iGEM conference in Taiwan
Qiao JIN, Chenghao GE and Mingjie LUO, three of our team members, attended the 2016 iGEM conference
held by NCKU in Taiwan from August 8 ~ 14. The conference served as a “small jamboree” facing
to teams in Asia, and presentations and poster introductions were given according to different
project designs as well as experiment progress. We were grateful for this opportunity to communicate
and interact with fellow teams in iGEM community, exchanging ideas and comments, sharing experience,
making friends. We were impressed by many projects presented at the conference, and received a lot
of helpful advice.
