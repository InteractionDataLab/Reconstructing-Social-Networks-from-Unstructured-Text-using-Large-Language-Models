When information flows through gene-regulatory networks, noise is introduced, and fidelity suffers. A cell unable to correctly infer the environment signals from the noisy inputs may be hard to make right responses. But what if the network structure is altered? What if a “parallel circuit”, where independently transcribed monomers assemble into functional complexes for downstream regulation, is in place of a “series circuit”? Inspired by information theory, we scrutinize noise propagation in parallel information channels, and construct synthetic biology circuit using split florescent proteins and split dCas9 to quantitatively measure the capacity of these information channels. Computation and wet lab work are combined to optimize our understanding of such systems, and to interpret potential biological significance of reoccurring parallel designs in nature.
