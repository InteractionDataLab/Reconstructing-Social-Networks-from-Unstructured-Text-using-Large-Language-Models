Transformed 5uL of BBa_J04450 at a concentration of 20pg/uL into Stellar competent cells using the following protocol:
Remove competent cells from -80°C freezer and thaw on wet ice (10-15 minutes).
Add DNA (pre-chilled) to 100μL of cells on ice.  Stir briefly with a pipet tip – DO NOT pipet up and down to mix as this can heat up cells and introduce bubbles.
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
Heat-shock cells by placing tube in a 37°C heat block for 1 min.
Return cells to ice for 2 minutes.
Add 950μL of room temperature SOC to the cells in the culture tube.
Place tubes in a shaking incubator at 250 rpm for 1 hour at 37°C.
Centrifuge at 1,000g for 1 min, remove and discard 950μL of supernatant, resuspending cells gently in remaining SOC (~150μL).
Plate entire sample of transformed cells on LB agar plates with the chloramphenicol.
Incubate plates upside down overnight at 37°C.

Colonies from previous transformation were selected on the criteria of size and isolation for overnight culture.  The selected colonies were removed with a pipette tip.  The pipette tip was then placed into a 14mL culture tubes containing 10mL LB and 10uL 1000X Chloramphenicol.  The plates were incubated overnight at 37°C.
