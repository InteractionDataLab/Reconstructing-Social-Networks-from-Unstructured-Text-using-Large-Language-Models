Gel Purification
IX - Purify by Gel/PCR Column
 
NOTE: This follows the protocol for the Promega SV Gel and PCR cleanup kit and centrifuge step.
 
1.     Weigh gel slice.
2.     Place a SV Minicolumn into a collection tube.
3.     Add Membrane Binding Solution at a ratio of 10μl of solution per 10mg of agarose gel slice.
4.     Vortex (or invert) the mixture and incubate at 50–65°C for 10 minutes or until the gel slice is completely dissolved.
 
NOTE: The maximum capacity of the column is 350mg of gel mass dissolved in 350μl of Membrane Binding Solution per column pass. For gel slices >350mg, continue to pass additional sample through the SV Minicolumn until the entire sample has been processed. The maximal amount of agarose that can be processed through a single column is approximately 3.5g (10 × 350mg) total.  For DNA fragments > 5kb, mix by inversion rather than vortexing to avoid shearing DNA.
 
5.     Transfer up to 350μL dissolved gel sample to column and incubate 3 min at room temperature.
6.     Centrifuge 16,000g for 1 min and discard flowthrough.
7.     Add 700μL Membrane Wash solution, centrifuge 16,000g for 1 min and discard flowthrough.
8.     Perform second was with 500μL Membrane Wash solution, centrifuge 16,000g for 5 min and discard flowthrough.
9.     Dry membrane by centrifuging 16,000g for 1 min.
10. Transfer column to new, sterile 1.5mL tube and add 23.5μL Nuclease-free water.  Incubate at room temperature for 4 min.
11. Centrifuge at 16,000g for 1 min.
12. Determine DNA concentration by NanoDrop.
13. DNA can be stored at -20°C
 
Ligation
X – Ligation
 
NOTE: Ratios need to be calculated based on insert and vector lengths.  For a 5kb vector and 1kb insert, 50ng of vector corresponds to 10ng of insert.  For a 10:1 insert to vector ratio, the ligation would contain 50ng vector and 100ng insert.  Determine the limiting component and scale reaction accordingly to use maximum volume of correct 10:1 ratio.  Do not exceed a 50μL reaction volume.
 
1.     Assemble ligation reaction containing appropriate insert/vector DNA and buffer.
2.     Incubate at 45°C for 5 minutes to ensure nothing is pre-annealed.
3.     Add 1μL T4 DNA Ligase
4.     Incubate 16°C overnight.
5.     Incubate reaction at RT for 30 minutes
6.     Purify by column cleanup, eluting in 12μL nuclease-free H2O.
 
Transformation
XI - Transformation
 
NOTE:  Chemically competent cells are temperature sensitive, do not allow them to warm up, this will lower transformation efficiency.  
 
1.     Remove competent cells from -80°C freezer and thaw on wet ice (10-15 minutes).
2.     Add entire miniprep DNA (pre-chilled) to 100μL of cells on ice.  Stir briefly with a pipet tip – DO NOT pipet up and down to mix as this can heat up cells and introduce bubbles.
3.     Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
4.     Heat-shock cells by placing tube in a 37°C heat block for 1 min.
5.     Return cells to ice for 2 minutes.
6.     Add 950μL of room temperature SOC to the cells in the culture tube.
7.     Place tubes in a shaking incubator at 250 rpm for 1 hour at 37°C.
8.     Centrifuge at 1,000g for 1 min, remove and discard 950μL of supernatant, resuspending cells gently in remaining SOC (~150μL).
9.     Plate entire sample of transformed cells on LB agar plates with the appropriate antibiotic.
10. Incubate plates upside down overnight at 37°C.
