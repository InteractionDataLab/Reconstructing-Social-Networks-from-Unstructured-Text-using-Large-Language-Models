Consulting Doctors
</FONT></DIV><P><FONT style="line-height:1.5;" size="4">   
Because our project relates to virus, we should treat it with caution, and have more communication with doctors. We have been to four hospital surveying and asking doctors what they think of our project.

We first went to the Guangdong frontier Defence General Hospital and recorded a video in May 2nd. According to the doctor, we knew that although HCV is a type of infectious disease, just a few concern about it. That’s because the virus can incubate for a long time after the initial infection and keep damaging the liver of the patients. Only when the HCV virus causes enough damage to the body can it be discovered. So we realized that we should raise the public awareness of prevention of HCV.
   
Doctors also queried the validity of our project, because they doubted that whether the substrate, gingival crevicular fluid, has enough concentrations of the virus. And then we intended to use serum instead of gingival crevicular fluid, and improve the sensitivity of our paper.
   
From the communication with doctors, we learnt that to test whether a patient is HCV-positive needs a long time, usually for two hours. It means that our paper will obtain the result much faster than the testing technology at present.

On August 27th, SFLS-iGEM went to consult the doctors about our project and conduct a survey on HCV detection. We consulted Xiuqing Liu, the director of laboratory medicine, who introduced us to the current situation of the application of the HCV virus test paper. After the conversation, we realized that our idea of promoting our test paper to the blood bank was unrealistic, for they only examine the blood after they transport it to the blood centre. We also got to know other ways of detecting HCV virus.
   
After that, we surveyed over 100 medical workers from stomatology department and ICU with the questionnaire. The question included: the current situation of HCV detection, the pros and cons of paper testing, and the public awareness of HCV.
   
The result indicated the following points:

1.	Many patients didn’t receive timely treatment, for common people wouldn’t take HCV examination regularly.

2.	All of the current ways of detection has the disadvantages of inconvenience and time-consuming. On the contrary, our paper is quick    and convenient, and meets the demand of certain kinds of examination.
   
Based on this survey, we perfected our project in the following aspects:

1.	We added a “kill switch” on our paper in order to insure the safety of our device, as the doctor suggested.

2.	We reconsidered the possible application of our teat paper, and eventually decided to change our targeting market from the common    people to the hospitals.

3.	We realized that it’s vital to make the HCV more well-known to the public if we really want to promote our test paper. We should    also control the price in order to make it more acceptable for the public.

We went to The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital for a survey in August 28th. Doctor Xing and Docimaster Li entertained us patiently. We consulted about control line of the text paper, sample taking and evaluation of the outcome. The doctors drew some charts for in order to make the solution more accurate.
   
Through the discussion, we learnt the following points:

1.General design of the control;

2.The use of gingival crevicular fluid has not been standardized, and the HCV RNA in gingival crevicular fluid is not as much as the    same quality of (that in)serum.
   
Because of these points, we decide to Make a little change to our project. We finally decide to use serum as sample, and st different concentration ranges of HCV virus as the parameter of result.
