Referring to hospitals
</FONT><P><FONT style="line-height:1.5;" size="4">   Concerning about the practical usage of our project in reality, we continuously referred to four hospitals in Shenzhen city from the beginning of our project to now. They are Guangdong Frontier Defense General Hospital, the Second People’s Hospital of Shenzhen, the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital and the Third People’s Hospital of Shenzhen. We conducted a survey aimed at people there whose work involves with virus detection in the latter three hospitals, which mainly gave us advice on enlarging the scale of promotion about HCV towards the masses and reminding us to focus on enhancing speed and accuracy of our test paper method. Meanwhile, we also seek advice from Dr. Xing from the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital and Dr. Liu the Second People’s Hospital of Shenzhen, who respectively work in the department of Clinical Microbiology and Infection Control and the department of Detection. They both rang a bell in our mind while mentioning about the design of a quality control on the test paper. As the doctors being unanimous in advice about dissemination towards the public, we started to arrange an activity held in the Shenzhen Book City concerning this matter. </FONT></P><DIV class="text"><FONT size="7">
Discussing with stakeholders

After we gave a brief description of our project, they offered suggestions involving seech-delivering and product realeasing. According to their introduction, we knew that there are many processes to go through before the product go public. For example our paper should be tested by quality inspection department and should undergo clinical trials first. And the shelf life is important too. We also learnt that investigators lay great emphasis on the originality and an apparent advantage over competitive products of our project.
