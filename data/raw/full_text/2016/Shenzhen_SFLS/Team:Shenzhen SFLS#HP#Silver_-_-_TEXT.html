Planting interest in youngsters
    Our team found that teenagers, with responsibility of adulthood approaching, should be the best group to be educated and inspired by iGEM and our project. Therefore, we held two presentations at junior highs nearby in a roll on June 7th and 8th. Hundreds of students took part in our prasentation.
    To start off, we gave a brief introduction of iGEM and synthetic biology together with our bonus gifts for answering questions---antibiotic free mediums that were aimed to attract more attentive participation of the audience. And this really worked out! The video recorded before and a short clip we cut from Lucy was used to put forward our topic as well. After that, we laid emphasis on our project description. We felt responsible to let these students realize the serious current situation involving HCV accurately so that he or she and people close to them will be prevented from infecting the diseases. During the process, we implied role-play into our presentation to make it easier to understand and remember, which also won us warm applauses and a hall full of laughter.
    After the presentation, some audience huddled up around us and continued to raise lots of inspiring questions about our project and synthetic biology as well. We were so glad to witness the great interest being triggered from the youth and their critical thus creative way of thinking.
    To sum up, not only did we gain a valuable experience of spreading our ideas, but also the key to the splendid world of biology has given to our younger alumni.
Meetup
    Our team organized a meetup located in our campus on August 1st.
    We started sending out invitation in June, and almost all of the high school teams in the Southeast China were invited. However, just a week before the meetup, not as much teams showed up as we expected, mainly for financial issues. At last, Team_JFLS arrived in time as they promised and despite lots of difficulties we’ve been through, the result turns out to be satisfying.
    The meeting starts with each team drawing a picture illustrating about their experience during iGEM participation. Then, we demonstrated our project one by one. Our team surprisingly found that our project has many similarities with that of Jinan Foreign Languages School. We discussed the possibility of collaborating on our experiment and learned a lot from each other. In the afternoon, 3 post-doctoral scholars from CSMedLab delivered a very informative speech about transgenic plants and after that, answered our questions patiently. We have gained a lot of knowledge as well as some social skills in this activity.
Questionnarie about HCV Dectection
    We released an online questionnaire on September 1st   and received 1023 valid answers by the time we closed the website on September 22ed. Our sample of this survey came from all over the country as shown below. It’s worth mentioning that we also received 24 answers coming abroad, which encouraged our teammembers a lot.
                                                                  
    We selected some of the questions and will explain how the feedback helped us refine our project.
    The results of question2 and question4 indicate that the public only have a vague idea about Hepatitis C. Quite a high percentage of people don’t know what it is, and lots of people thought that HCV can transmit through saliva. The fact of this urged us to pay more efforts to popularize information concerning Hepatitis C to the public. We have learned that antiviral medicines can cure approximately 90% of persons with hepatitis C, but access to diagnosis and treatment is low. This firms our belief that HCV detection should be added into the annual physical examination, and question8 and 9 shows that the public are with us.
    According to the result of question5 and 6, though the interviewees are not so familiar with the term “Hepatitis C”, they actually did quite well answering questions about the incubation period and symptoms of Hepatitis C, which is a real comfort to us.
    We made significant changes after collecting the data. Question 12, specifically, inspired us to reconsider the places where we can apply our test paper. We refined our product positioning and decided to promote it mainly to the hospital instead of aiming at the household market.
    The results of question10 and 11 are particularly instructive. These two questions contraposed the problems we might encounter with while promoting our paper. Those advices people given are of great practical value, and will definitely help making our theory into actual product.
    After collecting the data, we did lots of public activities to popularize the idea of Hepatitis C, which will be mentioned later. Based on the result, we improved our project in various aspects, like the design of a quality control area, as we just listed. The SFLS_iGEMers are inspired and encouraged greatly. This is a really satisfying and informative investigation.
    Following is a part of outcomes of the qusetionnaire.
    2. How well do you know about Hepatitis C?   [Multiple choice]
    4.How do you think HCV spread?    [Can choose more than one answer]
    5.Which one do you consider as the most likely situations after infected by HCV?   [Multiple choice]
    6. How long do you think it takes to show obvious symptoms since infected by HCV?   [Multiple choice]
    8.Do you think it is necessary to increase the amount of HCV detection when doing blood donation and blood transfusion under the situation of having no vaccine?    [Multiple choice]
    9.Do you think it’s necessary to add HCV detection into the annual physical examination?   [Multiple choice]
    10.Which price could you accept for per test?   [Multiple choice]
    11.What do you think is the biggest challenge while extending our HCV test paper?   [More than one answer can be chosen]
    12.Where do you think our HCV test paper can apply to?   [Multiple choice]
    14. We used gingival crevicular fluid as the substrate for the test, so we need to insert a capillary into the gingival to collect substrate. The process is quick but may be painful. Your attitude towards this process is:   [Multiple choice]
