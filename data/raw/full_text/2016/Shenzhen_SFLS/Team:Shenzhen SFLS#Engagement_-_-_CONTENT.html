Since HCV is often ignored by the public,comparing to diseases causing similar extend of damage to human bodies, our team is eager to enhance the promotion of HCV and relating hepatitis facts.   
Our team organizes three presentations targeting on junior and senior high students. The presentations include a brief introduction of iGEM and synthetic biology together with the summary of our project. Applying antibiotic free mediums as bonus gifts to attract more attentive participation of the audience and to trigger their scientific curiosity into the biology world was a great success. The active input of our audience during the presentation and the flood of questions they raised after the presentation really surprised us and encouraged us.   
Besides, while we are conducting questionnaires respectively aimed at the masses and senior high students, we always offer a short introduction of facts about HCV. The results of the students group, most of which attended our former presentations, were better with questions concerning basic facts about HCV than the masses group.
   In order to enhance the promotion of hepatitis facts, we held an activity regarding dissemination towards the public in Shenzhen Book City, where is consider one of the most popular spots for weekends. Our team members send more than 200 flyers and bookmarks with information about hepatitis and detection methods with a banner summarizing our project setting up up to give further explanations. People who received the flyers were often interested and willing to raise some questions and listen to our explanation. It felt heart-warming to see the curving smiles on children’s faces when they got a free badge featured with our team icons or a bookmark that they immediately fold into their new books.    Our team’s wechat subscription updates tips and news involving with our project and synthetic biology from time to time.

Our team found that teenagers, with responsibility of adulthood approaching, should be the best group to be educated and inspired by iGEM and our project. Therefore, we held two presentations at junior highs and one in the senior high we are studying at. Hundreds of students took part in our presentation.
   
To start off, we gave a brief introduction of iGEM and synthetic biology together with our bonus gifts for answering questions---antibiotic free mediums that were aimed to attract more attentive participation of the audience. And this really worked out! The video recorded before and a short clip we cut from Lucy was used to put forward our topic as well. After that, we laid emphasis on our project description. We felt responsible to let these students realize the serious current situation involving HCV accurately so that he or she and people close to them will be prevented from being infected with the diseases. During the process, we implied role-play into our presentation to make it easier to understand and remember, which also won us warm applause and a hall full of laughter.
   
After the presentation, some audience huddled up around us and continued to raise lots of inspiring questions about our project and synthetic biology as well. We were so glad to witness the great interest being triggered from the youth and their surprising thus creative way of thinking.
   
To sum up, not only did we gain a valuable experience of spreading our ideas, but also the key to the splendid world of biology has given to our younger alum.
