General Cloning Workflow
a.PCR(Polymerase Chain Reaction) is often the first step of any cloning. Primers designed with overhangs containing specific restriction enzyme cutting site sequence are used in the reaction to clone out desired coding sequence. Set up the reaction according to manufacturer manuals. Here are the protocol of how we set up the reaction and our reaction cycle.
10*Buffer 10μl
dNTPs      8μl
primers     5μl*2
template   5μl
rTaq          1μl
ddH2O      66μl(the volume of reaction can be adjusted if needed)
Reaction Cycle
1.98℃ 30s
2.98℃ 10s*30
3.Annealing temperature 15s*30
4.72℃ 30s/kb*30
5.72℃ 1min
6.12℃ ∞(for preservation)
After the reaction, set up agarose gel electrophoresis to check the result; if correct, set up gel recovery as manufacturer manuals suggested. Here is the protocol we used.
1.2% Agarose Gel, 30ml
1. Mix 0.36g agarose with 30ml TAE Buffer
2. Heat up until agarose is thoroughly dissolved
3. Add 1.5μl of Goldview Nucleic Acid Gel Stain
4. Wait until it cools down to about 60℃, and pour it into a gel tray and let it solidify
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
1.Set gel tray into cuvette, filled with 1*TAE Buffer
2.Dye samples with 0.1* volume of loading buffer, mix thoroughly
3.Inoculate samples along with a DNA ladder for further reference of DNA sizes
4.Run gel at 120V at 30min
b.Digest DNA fragment recovered and vector backbone with desired restriction enzyme, set up reaction as manufacturer manuals suggested.Here is the protocol we used.
template            1μg
enzyme1           1μl(approximately 1U)
enzyme2           1μl(approximately 1U)
FD Buffer          3μl
ddH2O              add to 30μl
c.Recover digested fragment(through gel purification or column purification) and set up ligation reaction as manufacturer manuals suggested. Here is the protocol we used.
Ligation Reaction
10*T4 Buffer       3μl
Vector                 30ng
DNA fragment    30-50ng
T4 ligase            0.5μl
ddH2O                add to 30μl
d.Transform with the 30μl ligation reaction into DH5α
e.Pick 3 colonies on each plate for colony PCR and cultivate cultures with the correct colony PCR results
f.Carry out mini-preps. Here is the protocol we used.
TIANprep Miniplasmid Kit(4ml sample)
1.Transfer half the sample to a 2ml centrifuge tube
2.Centrifuge at 12000rpm for 1min
3.Discard supernatant, and transfer the other half to the same tube, centrifuge at 12000 for 1min,          discard supernatant
4.Add 250μl buffer P1 and vortex to resuspend cell pellet
5.Add 250μl buffer P2, and invert tubes 6-8 times, gently
6.Add 350μl buffer P3, invert tubes 6-8 times gently, shake tubes gently to disperse precipitate
7.Centrifuge at 12000rpm for 10min, compact precipitate
8.Transfer supernatant to mini-prep column
9.Centrifuge at 12000rpm for 1min, discard flow-through
10.Wash with 600μl PW Buffer, wait for 2min after adding, then centrifuge at 12000rpm for 1min,       discard flow-through
11.Repeat step 10
12.Centrifuge empty column at 12000rpm for 3min
13.Transfer columns to labeled eppendorfs, uncap the column and wait for 5min, let remaining       ethanol evaporate completely
14.Add 30μl ddH2O right to the silica gel and wait for 15min
15.Elute DNA by centrifuge at 12000rpm for 3min, discard the column
16.Nanodrop
g.Sequence the purified plasmids
Oligo Annealing Ligation
1.Set up the reaction as follows
T4PNK(Polynucleotide Kinase) Buffer 2.5μl
T4PNK                                                 1μl
oligo                                                    6.5*2
ddH2O                                                 add to 25μl
2.Cycle

94℃                       5min
room temperature  15min
For in vitro transcription reaction, we used MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit(Thermo Fisher Scientific).Set up reaction as its protocol suggested.
For RNA purification, we used Oligo Clean & Concentrator™(Zymo Research). Set up purification as its protocol suggested.
For cell-free reaction, we used E. coli S30 Extract System for Circular DNA(Promega). Set up reaction as protocol suggested.
tips for S30 system users:
1. add extra Luciferase Assay Reagent if the reaction can hardly be detected
2. if using enzyme b-galactosidase (LacZ) as reporter gene, add its substrates to a final concentration of 0.6g/L
3. if RNA trigger is introduced into the reaction, add RNase Inhibitor to the system as manufacturer instructions suggested
