Prototype
We came up with the idea of turning our detection method into a consumer product that can be conveniently and efficiently used. Our detection paper is named “HCV hunter”. By printing hydrophobic barriers on paper (Slomovic, 2015), we created hydrophilic channels, where the cell-free system and plasmids were placed. The paper is divided into three areas—two detection areas for HCV 1b and HCV 2a respectively, and a quality control area. Plasmids with toehold switches corresponding to short RNA sequences from HCV 1b and HCV 2a are separated so that the paper can distinguish between the two major genotypes of HCV prevalent in Asia, providing accurate information. Plasmids in the quality control area are positive controls, in which toehold switches aren’t inserted. When adding water to the paper, the quality control area should turn purple due to the expression of b-galactosidase under normal circumstances. Through observing whether the quality area turns purple, users can determine if the paper is damaged and whether the results are credible. The operation of the test paper is simple and concise. A specific amount of serum is used as detection substrate. Going through the process of dilution, boiling, and NASBA, it is ready to be added onto the paper, where the colorimetric reaction takes place. The resulting color in test areas, which can be distinguished by naked eye, qualitatively reveals whether the user carries HCV and discerns the genotype of HCV. For further analysis, devices such as electronic readers, or even cellphones with cameras, can provide a robust and quantitative measurements of sensor outputs at a relative low cost. On the basis of experimental data (Pardee, 2014), we built a mathematic model to correlate the color intensity with the concentration of HCV RNA in the samples, so as to provide semi-quantitative detection. We set intervals based on the concentration gradient. The highly approximate HCV RNA concentration calculated from color intensity falls into one of these intervals. The magnitude of the intervals is represented by different numbers of “+”s in the final result displayed, with more “+”s indicating higher concentration.
Application
Paper-based HCV detection has a wide range of application. In places where strict detection of blood borne viruses are required like drug rehab centers and blood centers, or places with high prevalence of HCV but low resources like some underdeveloped areas, our method offers not only a low-cost and efficient detection, for it isn’t as demanding in aspect of equipments and operating staff as other methods such as RT-PCR, but also guarantees the sensitivity, reducing the false-positive and false-negative rate greatly compared with other qualitative test paper. Since the diagnosis of HCV requires multiple parameters (virus load, liver function, etc.), our semi-quantitative detection results provides significant information for future treatment of HCV.
