8.1-8.7 Luciferase expression test: in liquid environment
8.8-8.14 Luciferase expression test: on test paper (liquid) GFP expression test: on test paper (liquid)
8.15-8.21 Luciferase expression test: in liquid environment Exploring variables of luciferase: 15ul, dilute into 50ul, then gradually added to the rest of the volume of the assay. And then gradually add 1/2 assay.
8. 23-8.31 Plasmid extraction, test sequence
9.18-9.25 Recovering PAAV-LACZ fragment by PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis Enzyme restricting and adding lacz to plasmid vector
9.25-9.31 Lacz expression test: in liquid environment
10.1-10.2  PCR, preparing for another cycle of plasmid(parts submission) construction
10.3 -10.4  analysing the reason why we get bad gel electrophoresis results
10.5-10.6 start another round of PCR
10.7-10.8 cut PCR product with restriction enzyme and start ligation reaction
10.9-10.10 transformed and failed due to the low quality of our competent cell
10.11-10.19 start a new round of plasmid construction
   
re-transform a former set of plasmids since we need them for our confirmatory experimen
mini-preps
test toehold switches
