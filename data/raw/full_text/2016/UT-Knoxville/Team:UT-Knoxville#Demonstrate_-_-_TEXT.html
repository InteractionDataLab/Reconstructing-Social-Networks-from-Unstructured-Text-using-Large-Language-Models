Bronze Medal
We registered our team and ready to go to the Jamboree in Boston.
All deliverable requirements have been met.
Our attributions are placed on the notebooks section of our wiki.
We added the following parts to the registry: BBa_K1966000 , BBa_K1966001 , BBa_K1966003 , BBa_K1966004 .
Silver Medal
We were able to characterize the function of following parts: BBa_K1966000 , BBa_K1966001 , BBa_K1966003 .
Collaboration:  We collaborated with the University of Georgia (UGA) iGEM team on their Formaldehyde Single Cell Project. Details of contribution can be found on our collaborations tab.
We worked with various institutions to organize multiple outreach events in the Knoxville area. Details can be found on the outreach tab of our wiki.
Gold Medal
Proof of Concept:  We were able to create a device capable of degrading toluene and converting it to benzylaldehyde using the xylA xylM holoenzyme to acquire a benzyl alcohol which is then converted to a benzylaldehyde using xylB. For further details on the group's proof of concept, please click here .
Demonstrate Your Work: In the laboratory we were able to show that our toluene degrading organism was capable of producing benzyl alcohol and benzylaldehyde from the real-world substrates of gasoline and a simulated form of BTX. Thus, we showed that our system was capable of functioning under the complex chemical stresses it would be exposed to in the field as a bioremediator and in industry as a production module.
