The UTK iGEM team collaborated with the UGA iGEM team to measure mcherry fluorescence of fixed Methanococcus maripaludis transformed with plasmids containing mcherry markers that allows the measurement of the strength of the RBS library. The UTK iGEM team took measurements of the L2C16, L1C18, and L1C12 mutants using a plate reader, and added these results to UGA's pool of plate reader measurements. Across the collaborated teams, L2C16 showed consistent results so L1C12 and L1C18 were measured against L2C16. The measurements taken by the teams, and the variability of these measurements are detailed below.
Figure 1: Measurements of L1C12 and L1C18 fluorescence as a percentage of L2C16 fluorescence for several teams using flow cytometers.
