After making our constructs, we transformed them into Keio Wild cells and inoculated from the successful transformation plates.

Colonies were chosen from the overnight plates and were diluted into 300 µL ultrapure water.  These dilutions were used to inoculate triplicates of 4 milliliter cultures and were grown at 170 rpm for 24 hours in 37C.  Each construct was treated to three different levels of IPTG induction(no IPTG, 10µM IPTG, and 100µM IPTG) to turn on the ClpXP degradation system and subsequently turn off GFP production.  Our initial results were promising. 

The constructs of the GFP with three different degradation tags were transformed into Keio Wild Type cells.  Colonies were chosen from the overnight plates and were diluted into 300uL ultrapure water.  These dilutions were used to inoculate triplicates of 4 milliliter cultures and were grown at 170 rpm for 24 hours in 37C.  Each construct was treated to three different levels of IPTG induction to turn on the ClpXP degradation system and subsequently turn off GFP production.  Our initial results were promising.  

The graph (below) shows significant differences between the levels of induction and the resulting degradation of GFP.  Of interest is the drop from 6000 GFP/OD for the GFP with no tag to the 2700 GFP/OD in the GFP LAA construct under 100uM IPTG induction.  Our next step is to complete this experiment in parallel in both Keio ClpX knock out and ClpP knock out strains.

We plated our constructs in all three cell types(DH10, Keio Wild, and Keio ClpP) on Kanamycin, Tetracycline, Chloramphenicol, and Ampicillin. We were testing to verify what backbones the plasmids were in.  As the image shows, our cells grew in most of the plates resistant to the specific antibiotics.  We are in the process of figuring out how we obtained these results, but we hypothesized that our cells contain constructs with all the vectors with backbones resistant to those antibiotics.

Since ClpXP can only degrade proteins that have been tagged, we expect our plates with the degrons to have a lower concentration of purple cells than the plates without the degrons. The following graph shows the relationship between time and expected concentration of purple cells for the Keio Wild strain; “T” represents the time at which the cells were induced by IPTG.
</LI><LI><U> Keio ClpX Knockout Strain:</U> In this strain, ClpX will be knocked out and ClpP will be allowed to function. ClpX is responsible for de-linearizing the target protein into its primary structure and then translocating it into a proteolytic cavity in ClpP. Since ClpX will not be expressed, the chromoprotein will not be de-linearized and hence prevent ClpP from degrading the primary structure of the protein. With this in mind, we expect our plates to remain purple in the Keio ClpX Knockout strain.

ClpP is responsible for degrading the primary structure of the protein itself; it does this by breaking the individual covalent bonds (polypeptide bonds) that exist between the amino acids in the polypeptide chain. Since ClpP will not be expressed, the chromoprotein will not be degraded into individual amino acids. However, despite this, the chromoprotein will still be degraded partially because it will be de-linearized by ClpX. In other words, although the protein will still be in its primary structure, it will still lack the hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ionic bonds, disulfide bridges, and R-Group interactions that exist in its tertiary (or in some cases, quaternary) structure; consequently, that will limit the chromoprotein’s ability to express its pigments. With this in mind, we expect our plates to have a smaller number of purple cells present in the Keio ClpP Knockout strain.
