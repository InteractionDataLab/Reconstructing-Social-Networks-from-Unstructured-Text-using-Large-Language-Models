Juliana Artavia
Industrial Design Engineering

Juliana Artavia
Juliana, 19, is the designer of the team, so she's the one who makes all the designs and drawings we post every time. She is a student of Industrial Design Engineering. Juliana loves searching for cool typographies on the web; her current love is “Poppins”, the one we use in this wiki. She says she doesn’t like romantic movies, but has a big love for chocolate.
Kevin Castro
Computing Engineering

Kevin Castro
Kevin is the Computer Engineer in charge of the wiki, but he is also helping us with some protein modelling, so we hope we can turn him into the dark side of bioinformatics. As he puts it: "This project has become the Kernel of my Linux, the html of my essence.com" When asked what he has learned about bacteria working with us, he replied: “they stink a lot”. He says he is a JavaScript lover, because it lets him do whatever he wants (just like programming bacteria).
Pablo Vargas
Biotechnology Engineering

Pablo Vargas
Pablo Vargas, 20, is the team´s community manager, he models (proteins, of course), and he loves when other people get interested in SynBio. He is a biotechnology engineer, who loves plants and bacteria, but also has time to work in the human health area. In the project, he has worked inprotein modelling and extraction. He also helped organize the SynBioThon 2016. He loves SciFi books, and his favorite author is Isaac Asimov.
Paula Thiel

Paula Thiel
Paula Thiel is the youngest member of the team (She´s 19). She was the one who started first at the SynBio world, she hadn´t even had her first class and she already was working in the lab. Apart from her love of biotechnology, she adores physics, so she studies both at the same time. In the project, she has worked with assembly, and also electrocompetent cells. She is also the link between the biology and the mathematics, in the modelling area.
Rafael Montenegro
Biotechnology Engineering

Rafael Montenegro
Rafael Montenegro, with 22 years, is the oldest member of our team, therefore, he is almost finishing his major. He is always reading papers and sharing them with us. He works in the Assembly section, both with 3A assembly and Golden Gate. He worked also as an assistant judge in SynBioThon, helping evaluate the projects other people generated.
Samantha García
Biotechnology Engineering

Samantha García
Samantha García was one of the first in the team to be part of the SynBio world, when she started to work in the biotech startup Cibus 3.0. Therefore, she holds a lot of experience in the lab. Besides from that, she also loves dancing, so she sometimes has to come back to the lab after her rehearsals. We don't only excel in science, it seems. Samantha works in the protein area, so she runs SDS-PAGEs and makes protein inductions several times a week. She also worked in SynBioThon getting medals, organizing the event, and helping the teams.
Sofía Vieto
Biotechnology Engineering

Sofía Vieto
Sofía Vieto is the most nice and kind member of our team; she always says hello with a smile and likes to keep peace in our un-slept souls. Yet, she also has great experience in SynBio, so she likes that everything goes well and according as planned. Apart from science, she loves tennis. Sofía works in the Assembly area, so she is usually seen by the side of a thermal cycler or growing transformed bacteria to extract their plasmids.Sofía is also the PR manager of the team, sending emails and setting up meetings.
Timothy Bustillos
Mechatronics Engineering

Timothy Bustillos
Timothy Bustillos is our Math Guy. He studies Mechatronic Engineering, but he also has had a great history on the Math Olympics, both national and international, he recently won a Medal in an Iberoamerican competition! What took kind of 6 months to biotech students to learn about bioprocesses, he learnt it in a few days! He works with the mathematical model of our project.
