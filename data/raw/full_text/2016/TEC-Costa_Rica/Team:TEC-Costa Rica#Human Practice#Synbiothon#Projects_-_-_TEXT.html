Projects
Here you can read about the 15 projects that were generated at SBT16.
AlumiGen3+
Design of a modified Pseudomonas capable of bioremediating aluminium saturated soils.
B-lytic
Design of a genetic circuit that allows the bioavailability of caffeic acid so it can be used as a nutritional supplement in drinks.
BetPro
Genetic modification of a yeast so it can produce Betaine from tyrosine.
BiKraglu
Over-production of n-acetyl polysaccharides to generate a natural glue inspired in the polysaccharides that bacteria produce to anchor different surfaces.
EctoCare
Production of Ectoine from orange peels (agroindustrial waste). Ectoine can be used as additive in sunblock formulations in order to diminish skin cancer incidence.
Fruit Endure
Solve the loss of climateric fruit due to ripening provoked by ethylene synthesis, stopping it by the suppression of essential genes at the adequate time.
GastroLac
Peptide secretion as a treatment for gastrointestinal infections generated by Helicobacter pylori.
Hemoalgae
Heparin (anticoagulant) synthesis in microalgae to provide a lower cost product.
Lug-AB
Synthesis of a new antibiotic.
MelAro
Biological synthesis of Melanin to supplant the chemical synthesis.
PAP-aleve
Production of a fosfatase with higher analgesic effect than morphine and no side effects.
Procelian
Probiotics production with a modified Lactobacillus with the capacity of synthesising an enzyme for gluten degradation.
ReCellutions
Nepidermin (Human Epidermal Growth Factor) production in yeast, for cicatrization.
Vegg
Synthesis of Phosphatidylcholine (main component of egg yolk) with the objective of producing vegan products.
VOCsmell
Biosensor of volatile compounds generated in the body as indicators of Cirrhosis.
