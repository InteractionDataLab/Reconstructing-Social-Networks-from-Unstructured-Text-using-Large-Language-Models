Evaluation & Winners
The evaluation consisted of two different rounds.
First Round
During first round the 15 teams were divided in three groups (five teams per group) and one judge was assigned per group. Every team gave an exposition of five minutes while the respective judge scored from 1 to 10 the following aspects:
Presentation
Impact and viability
Chassis
Bioinformatic design
Once every judge listened the five teams that corresponded, they checked quickly the scores assigned and selected the two teams with highest scores. In this way, every judge selected two finalists, having a total of six teams for the second round:
AlumiGen3+
GastroLac
Hemoalgae
PAP aleve
MelAro
BetPro
Second Round
At the second round the six finalists were asked to give a presentation of 10 minutes, with two minutes extra for questions from the judges. In this round the four judges (including Silver, who qualified Benchling during the first round) listened the six presentations, but every judge evaluated a different aspect:
30% - Bioinformatic design, by Silver Ceballos.
30% - Technical viability, by Raúl Trejos.
