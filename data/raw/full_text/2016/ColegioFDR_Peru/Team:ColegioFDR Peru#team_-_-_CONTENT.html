I was born in Lima, Peru in the year 1999, but I moved to New York at the age of 5, and I lived there for 8 years. Recently, I moved back to Lima about 3 years ago, and I am so grateful to have become a part of this new FDR school community. In terms of science, I have always had a passion for it ever since we did physics and biology in the 5th grade and it has been growing and accumulating ever since. I found it so fascinating how anyone could practice it, and, with a little critical thinking and dedication, could bring something new to the table, making us more knowledgeable about the world around us, and advance our society. However, personally I have always been at a crossroads between physics and biology. I love the perspective of physics and how it breaks everything down fundamentally to understand the world and its processes, and that’s what I chose as an IB subject. But I also love how biology deals with the details and blueprints of real, living things, and how it impacts me on a much more personal level (since it makes me more intellectual about my own body), and I didn’t want to miss out on not knowing what the biology road would have been like. So that’s why I joined iGEM. To help me make the decision about which career path I want to take by enriching me in some of the best genetic engineering work done at this school.</P></DIV></DIV></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="BioImage"><UL class="img-list"><LI><SPAN class="text-content"><SPAN>David Lin</SPAN></SPAN><DIV id="Lin" class="modalDialog"><DIV><A href="#close" title="Close" class="close">X</A><H2>David Lin</H2><P>My name is David Lin and I’m a 16 year old student at Colegio FDR. I was born in Jinanxi, China and have lived in Lima, Peru for more than 8 years. As a science enthusiast, I find the topic of genetic engineering and synthetic biology fascinating. I believe that through this area of science, mankind will undergo great progress and create countless innovative solutions. My passion for science has always been a defining feature of my academic career and personal philosophy. It has influenced my future career choices and helped me learn more about this amazing world. This is why I have joined iGEM, my goal is to learn more about these areas of science through experimentation and creation.</P><P>A fun fact about me is that I share a common interest in mechanical engineering, for I have constructed a functional motorcycle for the MYP Personal Project.</P></DIV></DIV></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="BioImage"><UL class="img-list"><LI><SPAN class="text-content"><SPAN>Daniel Sanchez</SPAN></SPAN><DIV id="sanchez" class="modalDialog"><DIV><A href="#close" title="Close" class="close">X</A><H2>Daniel Sanchez</H2><P>My name is Daniel Sanchez and I am 16 years old.

I was born in Lima, but lived in Chile for 6 years before coming back to Peru. Ever since I took an Anatomy and Physiology course in the summer of 8th grade I’ve had a very strong interest in science– specifically biology and chemistry. Last year for science class we had to conduct our own original lab, and I chose to research the effect of UVA exposure on planaria (flatworms). This project sparked my interest in scientific research, and in the future I hope to pursue this passion by studying biology in college. I joined iGEM because I find synthetic biology fascinating and with the hope of being able to make a difference in the world through science.</P></DIV></DIV></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="BioImage"><UL class="img-list"><LI><A href="#delatorre"><SPAN class="text-content"><SPAN>Guillermo de la Torre</SPAN></SPAN></A><A href="#close" title="Close" class="close">X</A><H2>Guillermo de la Torre</H2><P>I am a 15-year-old student at Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I was born in Lima, Perú. I am aware of the vast wanders in the world of science, hence why I enjoy biology so much. I am currently a sophomore at Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the American school of Lima. I am particularly passionate about biology as a whole and pharmaceuticals. Regarding my future, I hope to become a osteopathic surgeon or work in a pharmaceuticals company creating and developing medicine. My passion for science has always been around, and is key for when my professional endeavors take place.</P><P><B>Fun Fact:</B> I went to a summer program and the Johns Hopkins University and I enjoy playing Water Polo very much.</P></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="BioImage"><UL class="img-list"><LI><SPAN class="text-content"><SPAN>Janella Schwab</SPAN></SPAN><DIV id="schwab" class="modalDialog"><DIV><A href="#close" title="Close" class="close">X</A><H2>Janella Schwab</H2><P>
I am Janella Schwab, a 16-year old Junior at FDR. I have lived in Peru, Colorado en Ecuador. Ever since I can remember I have been interested in all sciences and in understanding the world around me. I will definitely pursue a career regarding the sciences, specifically veterinary medicine. I have visited veterinaries and been able to watch three operations, which has helped me confirm my interest in science. I believe that iGem will not only help me explore this passion but will also help me become more skilful and have more initiative. </P><P><B>Fun fact:</B> I had open-heart surgery in 2010 in Cleveland to cure a VSD (a hole in the wall separating the two lower chambers of the heart).</P></DIV></DIV></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="BioImage"><UL class="img-list"><LI><SPAN class="text-content"><SPAN>Jared Park</SPAN></SPAN><DIV id="park" class="modalDialog"><DIV><A href="#close" title="Close" class="close">X</A><H2>Hyunjun (Jared) Park</H2><P>My name is Hyunjun (Jared) Park and I’m a 17 year old student at Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

The concept of genetic engineering caught my attention as I wish to study biomedical engineering as my career. After joining the iGem team, I not have only learned the scientific knowledge but have also learned the hard process that the team had to undergo. I simply would like to thank everyone in the team for all the amazing experience and support.</P></DIV></DIV></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="BioImage"><UL class="img-list"><LI><SPAN class="text-content"><SPAN>Mikhail Lujan</SPAN></SPAN><DIV id="lujan" class="modalDialog"><DIV><A href="#close" title="Close" class="close">X</A><H2>Mikhail Lujan</H2><P>My name is Mikhail Lujan, and I am a 16 year old student at Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
