Fernando Zavala
Hello, my name is Fernando Zavala, I am 16 years old, and I am a student here at FDR, American school of Lima.  I was born in Lima, Peru in the year 1999, but I moved to New York at the age of 5, and I lived there for 8 years. Recently, I moved back to Lima about 3 years ago, and I am so grateful to have become a part of this new FDR school community. In terms of science, I have always had a passion for it ever since we did physics and biology in the 5th grade and it has been growing and accumulating ever since. I found it so fascinating how anyone could practice it, and, with a little critical thinking and dedication, could bring something new to the table, making us more knowledgeable about the world around us, and advance our society. However, personally I have always been at a crossroads between physics and biology. I love the perspective of physics and how it breaks everything down fundamentally to understand the world and its processes, and that’s what I chose as an IB subject. But I also love how biology deals with the details and blueprints of real, living things, and how it impacts me on a much more personal level (since it makes me more intellectual about my own body), and I didn’t want to miss out on not knowing what the biology road would have been like. So that’s why I joined iGEM. To help me make the decision about which career path I want to take by enriching me in some of the best genetic engineering work done at this school.

David Lin
My name is David Lin and I’m a 16 year old student at Colegio FDR. I was born in Jinanxi, China and have lived in Lima, Peru for more than 8 years. As a science enthusiast, I find the topic of genetic engineering and synthetic biology fascinating. I believe that through this area of science, mankind will undergo great progress and create countless innovative solutions. My passion for science has always been a defining feature of my academic career and personal philosophy. It has influenced my future career choices and helped me learn more about this amazing world. This is why I have joined iGEM, my goal is to learn more about these areas of science through experimentation and creation.
A fun fact about me is that I share a common interest in mechanical engineering, for I have constructed a functional motorcycle for the MYP Personal Project.

Daniel Sanchez
My name is Daniel Sanchez and I am 16 years old. I am Peruvian and American. I am a student Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt the American school of Lima. Biology has always interested me and I think that synthetic biology is an area where many breakthroughs are occurring. iGem seemed like a great way to explore my interests.
Fun Fact: I have played different sports throughout my life including lacrosse, soccer, and football. I have also been playing the trumpet for many years.

Sofia Gonzales
My name is Sofia Gonzalez, I’m 16 years old and currently a junior at Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt in Lima, Peru. I was born in Lima, but lived in Chile for 6 years before coming back to Peru. Ever since I took an Anatomy and Physiology course in the summer of 8th grade I’ve had a very strong interest in science– specifically biology and chemistry. Last year for science class we had to conduct our own original lab, and I chose to research the effect of UVA exposure on planaria (flatworms). This project sparked my interest in scientific research, and in the future I hope to pursue this passion by studying biology in college. I joined iGEM because I find synthetic biology fascinating and with the hope of being able to make a difference in the world through science.

Guillermo de la Torre
I am a 15-year-old student at Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I was born in Lima, Perú. I am aware of the vast wanders in the world of science, hence why I enjoy biology so much. I am currently a sophomore at Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the American school of Lima. I am particularly passionate about biology as a whole and pharmaceuticals. Regarding my future, I hope to become a osteopathic surgeon or work in a pharmaceuticals company creating and developing medicine. My passion for science has always been around, and is key for when my professional endeavors take place.
Fun Fact: I went to a summer program and the Johns Hopkins University and I enjoy playing Water Polo very much.

Janella Schwab
I am Janella Schwab, a 16-year old Junior at FDR. I have lived in Peru, Colorado en Ecuador. Ever since I can remember I have been interested in all sciences and in understanding the world around me. I will definitely pursue a career regarding the sciences, specifically veterinary medicine. I have visited veterinaries and been able to watch three operations, which has helped me confirm my interest in science. I believe that iGem will not only help me explore this passion but will also help me become more skilful and have more initiative.
Fun fact: I had open-heart surgery in 2010 in Cleveland to cure a VSD (a hole in the wall separating the two lower chambers of the heart).

Hyunjun (Jared) Park
My name is Hyunjun (Jared) Park and I’m a 17 year old student at Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I was born in South Korea and have lived in Lima, Peru for about 5 years. Ever since I studied biomedical science during the summer of 8th grade, I have acquired a strong interest for science. The concept of genetic engineering caught my attention as I wish to study biomedical engineering as my career. After joining the iGem team, I not have only learned the scientific knowledge but have also learned the hard process that the team had to undergo. I simply would like to thank everyone in the team for all the amazing experience and support.

My name is Mikhail Lujan, and I am a 16 year old student at Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I joined iGem because of my interest in synthetic biology and general chemistry. I hope that the skills I learn from iGem will help me later in life as I hope to pursue a career in synthetic biology. I believe that iGem is a challenging yet worthwhile group for those interested because of the freedom it gives students to create truly unique ideas for a better future.

Frances Fischman
My name is Frances Fischman, and I am currently a junior in Colegio Roosevelt. I was born here in Lima, Perú, 16 years ago, and have attended the school throughout my whole academic life. I have always been an avid learner and a curious student, but my passion for science-related careers started in high school when I came in contact with a surgeon. She let me into her operation room and allowed me to take notes and ask questions, I learned a lot from this experience. My main field of interest is biology and the neurosciences, but I am open and eager to learn much more.
Fun fact:I have attended to two open surgeries, a cerebral angioplasty and a liposuction and abdominoplasty. These operations lasted several hours, yet were of low risk to the patients. I was able to observe and learn from the doctors leading the surgeries.
