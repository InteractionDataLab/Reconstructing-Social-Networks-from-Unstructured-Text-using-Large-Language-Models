Because we work in a high school, we operate under biosafety level 1 across the board. We teach new members safety techniques through hands-on learning experiences. We continually operate in accordance with BSL 1. In addition to these, we utilize careful and continuing education in lab safety. We also work solely with the K1 strain of E. Coli to cut down on the risk associated with bacteriaBefore beginning our project, we all went through a training process to ensure that we were all safe during the time we spent in the lab. This training included:
                <UL><LI>yearly safety training for staff (in house)</LI><LI>safety training student</LI><LI>all new techniques demonstrated by teacher and then practiced by students with direct supervision.</LI><LI>all labs begin with safety lecture, reminders, considerations; all labs supervised by instructor</LI><LI>experiments designed by students must include safety considerations and protocols must be approved by teacher prior to conducting experiments.</LI></UL></H4></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
