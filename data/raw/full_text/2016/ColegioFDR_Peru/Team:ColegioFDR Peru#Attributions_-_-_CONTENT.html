We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.</P><P>
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.</P></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><H5> What should this page have?</H5><UL><LI>General Support</LI><LI>Project support and advice</LI><LI>Fundraising help and advice</LI><LI>Lab support</LI><LI>Difficult technique support</LI><LI>Project advisor support</LI><LI>Wiki support</LI><LI>Presentation coaching</LI><LI>Human Practices support</LI><LI> Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team</LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H5> Can we base our project on a previous one? </H5><P>Yes!
