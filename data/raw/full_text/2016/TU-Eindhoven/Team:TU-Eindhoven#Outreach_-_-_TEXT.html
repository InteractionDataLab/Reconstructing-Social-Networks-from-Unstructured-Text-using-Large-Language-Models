On the 14th of April, our team was invited by the Dutch Biotechnology Association (NBV) to attend their conference. We enjoyed the interesting talks about new developments in synthetic biology and also participated in a refreshing discussion about the ethical aspects of synthetic biology.

Dream and Dare
On the 24th of April, Eindhoven University of Technology celebrated its 60th anniversary with the Dream and Dare festival. A science tour for children was organized and we were very happy to be a part of this. We explained the iGEM competition and the basics of our research and synthetic biology to parents. Moreover, we cultured bacteria from smartphones, banisters, tables and a lot of other places on petri dishes to teach the children that bacteria are present everywhere and that they are not always bad.
Synenergene Forum
On the 24th of June, our team visited the SYNENERGENE forum in Amsterdam. SYNENERGENE is an European project which aims to open dialogue on responsible research and innovation (RRI). During this conference, we heard interesting talks about RRU. We also participated in an interesting discussion about the impact of religion on synthetic biology.(https://www.rathenau.nl/en/agenda/synenergene-forum-2016 )
Open Days
At the Open Days of our university, we presented the iGEM competition and the TU Eindhoven team to future students of our university. We explained the term synthetic biology and explained why the iGEM competition is important and interesting.  Moreover, we wanted them to get interested in the field of research and challenge them to get the most out of their studies.
