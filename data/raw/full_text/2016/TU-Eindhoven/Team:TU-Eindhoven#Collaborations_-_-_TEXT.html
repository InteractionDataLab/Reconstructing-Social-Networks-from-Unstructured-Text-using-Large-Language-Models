Rosetta beginner's guide
Together with iGEM team Technion Israel we have written a beginner's guide to Rosetta meant to help new iGEM teams in their protein design. This guide contains information on how to install and use Rosetta and other useful software for protein design, such as PyMol and Chimera. The guide also contains information on what protocols to use and how to use them, databases to find all the necessary files such as a protein database and chemical compound files, and the use of external sources. Besides all this useful information, the guide contains information on how to process your results and some helpful tips and tricks in general. The guide can be found here .
Secret Message
The iGEM team Groningen contacted us whether we would like to decode a secret message from their bacterial spores. This message is protected by computational encryption, while the secret key can only be accessed from the spores with the right growing conditions. Groningen sent us the spores and after some PCR programs, overnight culturing, and sequencing, we decrypted their message using their software . The message said: “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.”
Interview
On the 4th of August, iGEM EPFL interviewed our team for their iGEM news website. This website is created to bring iGEM teams from all over the world closer together with interviews, teams of the week and photos of the week. During the interview they asked us about the topic of our project, the worst thing that happened in the lab and what our secret is to get a good team spirit. Curious about the whole interview, you can read it here.
Translation of protocols
iGEM team METU HS Ankara invited us to work with them and other iGEM teams on translating protocols from English into different languages. This way, general protocols like making LB broth, transformation and plasmid isolation will become more easily accessible for people who do not have a great understanding of the English language. These protocols are available at their WIKI .  It was a nice collaboration and we hope we delivered a valuable contribution to their project. Thank you for inviting us for this collaboration!
Collaboration Badges
The iGEM team from Virginia asked us to fill out their survey regarding biocontainment, which we gladly did to help them with their research. For doing this Virginia has send us this collaboration badge as a token of appreciation. Check out the results of the survey on their WIKI . (Try hovering over the badge!)
The iGEM team from Evry made a survey about synthetic biology and asked us to fill this in. Moreover, if we could help them get more people to fill in the survey, we would earn a collaboration badge. And so we did, after asking our friends and families to help them out. Good luck with analysing the survey and we hope to hear the results !
