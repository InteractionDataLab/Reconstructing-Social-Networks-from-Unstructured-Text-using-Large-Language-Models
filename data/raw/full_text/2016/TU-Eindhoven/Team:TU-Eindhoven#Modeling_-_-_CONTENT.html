The Institute for Complex Molecular Systems provided us our own office in the Ceres building of the Eindhoven University of Technology. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="P_Header">Advisors</DIV><DIV class="Column"><P><SPAN class="Name">Prof.dr.ir. L. Brunsveld   </SPAN>,
<SPAN class="Name">Dr.ir. T.F.A. de Greef   </SPAN>,
<SPAN class="Name">Prof.dr. M. Merkx  </SPAN></P><P>
They helped us with brainstorming for a topic. During our project, they gave us helpful information about experiments and assays in the lab.
</P></DIV><DIV class="P_Header">Lab Support</DIV><DIV class="Column"><SPAN class="Name">Lenne Lemmens</SPAN><P> 
Lenne is a PhD student at our university whose research also involves the T14-3-3 protein. During the summer holidays she was our general supervisor in the lab and provided us answers to questions we had. </P><SPAN class="Name">Anniek den Hamer</SPAN><P> 
Anniek is a PhD student in the group of Luc Brunsveld. She helped us with designing the DNA sequences for our project and helped us during protein expression and performing assays with our proteins. She also provided the CT52-caspase-9 for our assays, since our variant could not be successfully synthesized in time. </P><SPAN class="Name">Peggy de Graaf-Heuvelmans</SPAN><P> 
Peggy gave us an introduction in the lab and taught us about lab safety. She also gave us access to the lab.  </P><SPAN class="Name">Moniek de Liefde </SPAN><P> 
Moniek is the safety officer from our lab. She helped us by verifying if everything we did in the lab was under the GMO permit from our university.  </P><SPAN class="Name">Stijn Aper </SPAN><P> 
Stijn Aper gave us an broad introduction how to work in the lab. He learned us all the basic lab skills we needed during our iGEM project. He also provided the DNA sequence for our scaffold, after Gibson Assembly of the T14-3-3 scaffold failed. </P><SPAN class="Name">Ardjan van der Linden &amp; Pascal Pieters </SPAN><P> 
Pascal and Ardjan provided us with the BsaI restriction enzyme.</P><SPAN class="Name">Cas van der Putten </SPAN><P> 
Cas was a member of the 2015 iGEM team from Eindhoven. He helped us by providing lab materials that were left over from their project. He also gave us helpful information to get us started in the lab. </P><SPAN class="Name">Remco Arts </SPAN><P> 
Remco gave us useful information about one of our assays. He knew a lot about furimazine, a component needed for our NanoLuc assays. </P><SPAN class="Name">Glenn Cremers   </SPAN><P> 
Glenn was a member of the 2014 iGEM team from Eindhoven. He gave us tips in the lab on how to improve our project. When we had questions, he was always able to help us. </P></DIV><DIV class="P_Header">Financial Support</DIV><DIV class="Column"><SPAN class="Name">Boukje van â€˜t Hof-Damhuis</SPAN><P> 
Boukje helped our team with solving structural problems that we faced during our project. </P><SPAN class="Name">Leon Luwijs </SPAN><P> 
Leon has been able to put up with all our questions and concerns about sponsoring, and helped taking care of these. </P><SPAN class="Name">Sagitta Peeters </SPAN><P> 
Sagitta visualized the financial aspects that are part of a project like ours, and helped us to face them. </P></DIV><DIV class="P_Header">Modeling Support</DIV><DIV class="Column"><SPAN class="Name">Tom de Greef  </SPAN><P> 
Dr.ir Tom de Greef has helped a lot during the modelling process, Thanks to him we had access to a supercomputer on our university, which has helped a lot during the design of our proteins. Furthermore he gave us advice on how to further improve and visualize our results, and provided tons of literature to base our project design on. </P><SPAN class="Name">Bart Markvoort </SPAN><P> 
Dr.ir. Bart Markvoort provided information and advice on how to properly use the supercomputer and gave us useful feedback on the orthogonal pair design protocol we developed. </P><SPAN class="Name">Minke Nijenhuis  </SPAN><P> 
Minke Nijenhuis is a Master's student at our university, she had previously written a protein-protein interaction model for a homodimeric T14-3-3 and CT52-caspase9, and thus provided the inspiration for the heterodimeric and homotetrameric T14-3-3 interaction model. She also answered some questions we had regarding our model and its optimization. </P><SPAN class="Name">Job Roodhuizen  </SPAN><P> 
Job Roodhuizen provided us with a Linux crash course and helped us out a lot during the analysis of the computational alanine scan results by providing us with his self-written visualization program. </P><SPAN class="Name">Anniek den Hamer  </SPAN><P> 
Anniek den Hamer is a PhD student at our university, she has a lot of knowledge about the T14-3-3/FC/CT52 complex and provided us with literature in which we could find vital parameters/constants to fill our model with. </P></DIV><DIV class="P_Header">Human Practices</DIV><DIV class="Column"><SPAN class="Name">Korienke Smit &amp; Cecile van der Vlugt  </SPAN><P> 
Korienke and Cecile helped our team with finding ways in which our project was related to safety or how it could contribute to safety. They also gave us the opportunity to present our findings at a meetup with several Dutch GMO policymakers.</P></DIV><DIV class="P_Header">Public Relations</DIV><DIV class="Column"><SPAN class="Name">Ivo Jongsma en Barry van der Meer </SPAN><P> 
Ivo and Barry gave us a media training, in which we gained some skills to also inform the society about our project.</P><SPAN class="Name">Lieke van Gorp </SPAN><P> 
Lieke knows all about the communication between universities and the media. She helped us with writing different parts and getting iGEM more famour on our university. Moreover, she gave us an opportunity to participate in a media training. With this media training we gained the ability to explain our project to the general public.  </P></DIV><DIV class="P_Header">WIKI and animations</DIV><DIV class="Column">
The WIKI and animations on the WIKI were designed and created by our team.
