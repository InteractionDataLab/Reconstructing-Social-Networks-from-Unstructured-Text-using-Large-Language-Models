Dear reader,
We are nine students from Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) that have been given the opportunity to be part of the iGEM competition this year. Not only do we participate because we all have a common interest in synthetic biology and are ambitious to learn more within this field, we also endeavor to take a prize back home, after the successes of the TU/e team from previous years.
We hope you enjoy reading about our project!
If you have any questions or comments whatsoever, feel free to contact us!
