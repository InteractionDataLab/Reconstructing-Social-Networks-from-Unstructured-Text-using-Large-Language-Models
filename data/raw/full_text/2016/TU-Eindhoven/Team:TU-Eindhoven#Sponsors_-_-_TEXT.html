ICMS
The Institute for Complex Molecular Systems (ICMS) aims to become the leading international multidisciplinary institute for research and education by combining the fields of mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and engineering to understand complex molecular systems. To achieve this goal, the ICMS does not only perform top research, but also trains young scientists, organizes interdisciplinary science activities and provides an advanced study center.  Not only has the ICMS provided us with funding for our project, she has also provided our team with an office to work in and has offered support from its staff. We are grateful towards the ICMS for making it possible for our team to attend the Giant Jamboree in Boston! For more information you can contact the ICMS Website.
