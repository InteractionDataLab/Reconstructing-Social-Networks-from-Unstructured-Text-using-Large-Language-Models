				In order to determine the properties of our designed protein pairs that cannot be directly measured, like the binding affinities/dissociation constants and cooperativity of our designed orthogonal pairs, we have developed a model based on mass-action and Michealis-Menten kinetics.
			</P><P>
				Our readouts will be done with our system in a quasi-steady state, so that is what our model will also be based on: It will be divided in 2 separate segments, the first will determine the quasi-steady state concentrations of all the proteins and protein-complexes in our system, the second will simulate the total activity based on the combined concentrations of the active complexes (both scaffold and non-scaffold mediated) in our system.
			</P></DIV><DIV class="P_Header"> Finding the equilibrium of our system</DIV><DIV class="Content_Row"><DIV class="Column_50"><P>
					In order to find the quasi-steady state approximation of the system we must analyze the enter cascade of complex-formations starting from the base proteins/ligands (see figure 1). The steady state assumption allows us to determine the mass-action kinetics between the proteins with dissociation constants. Dissociation constants present in our system are between T14-3-3 and Fusicoccin (K<SUB>D,Fc</SUB>)and between the T14-3-3-FC complex and the CT52s (K<SUB>D,C1</SUB> and K<SUB>D,C2</SUB>), The Dissociation constants must be separated since they are not identical and thus do not have the same binding affinity to their respective T14-3-3 monomers, and the Dissociation constant of the non scaffold mediated active complex (K<SUB>D,NoB</SUB>). 				Besides Dissociation constants, a cooperativity parameter σ is introduced to simulate the stimulating (σ &gt; 1) or inhibitory (σ &lt; 1) effects of the first CT52 on the scaffold on the binding of the second CT52. 

				</P></DIV><DIV class="Column_50"><DIV id="Equilibrium_Caption" class="Caption">Figure 1: A schematic representation of the complex-forming cascade of our heterodimeric T14-3-3 CT52 system.</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="P_Header">Formation of active complexes</DIV><DIV class="Column"><P>
				From figure 1 the mass-action equations can be derived. For the ease of notation the T14-3-3 scaffold will be represented as B, Fusicoccin as F, and CT52 by C, followed by a number (1 or 2) if necessary. The following equations can be derived:

				</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="Column"><P>
				Using the law of mass conservation we can setup equations for the total concentrations of the separate proteins and ligands in our system, which we can control during our assay:
			</P></DIV><DIR class="Column"><P>By substituting equations 1-13 in equations 14-17, we get (ridiculously lengthy) equations describing the free concentrations of the system:
			</P></DIR><DIV class="Column"><P>
				In order to solve equations 18 – 21 which contain multiple unknown variables, fixed point iteration is used using the initial conditions we use during our assays. Once equations 18-21 do not significantly change anymore we can assume the system is in a steady state and by using the results of the fixed point iteration we can calculate the concentrations of the complex species using equations 1-13, and finish the first segment of our model.
			</P></DIV><DIV class="P_Header">Activity</DIV><DIV class="Content_Row"><DIV class="Column_50"><P>
					In order to determine the activity of the active complexes, we first state that concentration of enzyme [E] is the sum concentrations of scaffold (BFFCC) and non-scaffold (CC) mediated complexes. Next we use Michaelis-Menten kinetics to determine the initial concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex:
				</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="Column"><P>
				Using this initial enzyme-substrate concentration and the catalytic rate (kcat) of the active enzyme, the initial reaction rate can be calculated. To convert this reaction rate (which is calculated in μM/s) into the activity which is measured in the assay and then calibrated using a substrate specific calibration curve, the following formula is used:

		Based on a previous research on the T14-3-3/Fusicoccin/CT52 complex by Würtele et al.1 we decide the binding affinities of Fusicoccin to the T14-3-3 and the wildtype CT-52 to the T14-3-3/Fusicoccin complex:

		The Kd,C1 parameter is based on CT52 on its own, without any proteins fused to it. This makes it an acceptable approximation for a CT52-smallBiT fusion, since smallBiT is only 11 amino acids long. Sadly this approximation is not accurate enough for CT52-Caspase9 fusion, since Caspase9 is much larger than CT52 and will likely cause steric hindrance, effectively decreasing the binding affinity. For this we use the dissociation constant for CT52-Caspase9 (Kd,C1 = 0.25 μM) and a

		The cooperativity represents the influence of the first CT52 in the T14-3-3/FC2/CT52 complex on the binding of the second CT52. This can be a positive influence (σ &gt; 1), negative (σ &lt; 1) or neutral (σ = 1)

		For all of our assays where we used NanoBiT to measure our protein activity concentrations of active complex were determined with the use of a calibration curve. However, the purpose of our caspase-9 assays is to determine the effect of the specific activity of the caspase-9 on our homotetrameric scaffold compared to the homodimer. To calculate this activity we also need the Michaelis-Menten constant (KM = 650 μM) 2, the catalytic rate (kcat = 0.2 s-1) 2 and an initial substrate concentration S0 which depends on the experimental parameters.

		When the model is executed, the program produces a graph that shows the concentration of the several complexes in our system as a function of the total scaffold concentration. Such a graph is shown in figure 1, containing the parameters mentioned above and some mock parameters.

		The graph above was produced using 2 different values for the CT52 binding affinity to the T14-3-3/FC complex, one (C1) has the value mentioned earlier, the other (C2) has the arbitrary value of 1μM, The binding affinity of NanoBiT was used for background activity (Kd,NoB). For now we simulate with both CT52 concentrations at 50 nM and FC concentration at 70 μM. Since FC binds weakly to T14-3-3 on its own, it needs to be in excess. Note that in the legend the scaffold is abbreviated as B, Fusicoccin as F, and the CT52 as C, with numbering if necessary.

		The biphasic effect is that when very little scaffold is present compared to the binding partners, there is little activity compared to its peak activity, which is to be expected, But the exceptional thing of scaffold proteins is that when there is very much scaffold present compared to the binding partners, activity will also decrease. This decrease happens because there are a lot of scaffolds that bind one of the binding partners, and cannot not bind a second because it is already bound to another scaffold.

		 that is inherent to scaffold proteins, it is slightly skewed towards higher concentrations due to the large positive cooperativity of the CT52 proteins and the peak is also at higher concentrations than the theoretical ideal ratio (2:1), instead it is at about 7:1. 
	</P><P>
		The Graph also shows that at these low concentrations the background activity (CC) is negligible. The effect of the difference in binding affinities of the CT52 is also clearly visible by the red and blue (C1) and the green and cyan (C2) lines.

		In order to determine the effectivity of a tetramer compared to that of a dimer, we will look at the specific activity of the CT52-proteins. For this purpose we have written a model for the formation of complexes in the homotetrameric system and for the homodimeric system. Developing a model for the heterotetrameric system has no added value compared to the heterodimeric system, as its purpose would be to determine the affinities of our mutated proteins, which our heterodimeric model can already do.
	</P><P>
		For the homodimeric and –tetrameric systems we use CT52-caspase-9 fused proteins, as these also form homodimers and thus are suitable for homoscaffolds. For this purpose we will use the alternative parameters discussed earlier.

	</DIV></DIV><DIV class="Column"><P>	
		As can be seen in figure 3, at smaller concentrations (left) higher order complexes like the 3 and 4 CT52 bound complexes are negligible, only at high concentrations (right) these become relevant. This hints that at low concentrations of binding partners the tetramer has no significant effect compared to the dimer.  The graphs also show that the total enzymatic activity (the dotted line) is dominated by the background activity for low scaffold concentrations. What is remarkable is that the ratio CT52:scaffold is lower than the theoretical ideal ratio (4:1), and that at this point the background activity barely contributes to it.

	</DIV></DIV><DIV class="Column"><P>
		Figure 4 shows us that at low concentrations of CT52-caspase9 the specific activity has a higher peak for the dimer than the tetramer, showing that the tetramer is a less efficient structure at these concentrations and thus maybe less preferable for an enzymatic reaction using homodimeric proteins, however It does show lower specific background activity, indicatingit is better able to suppress slight variations in concentrations.

</DIV></DIV><DIV class="Column"><P>
		As with low CT52 concentrations the specific activity of the CT52-caspase9 in the tetrameric system is lower than in the dimeric system, but what is very obvious is that it suppresses the background much better than de dimer, as the background activity of the dimer is far higher than the (just about visible) peak of the actual activity of the dimeric scaffold, where the tetramer stays somewhat stable for every concentration of CT52.

		Most of these models predict behavior similar to previously observed systems, showing naturally occurring effects such as the biphasic effect. Although these models alone are not enough to conclude any accurate values of the properties, such as binding affinity or cooperativity, of the proteins in question, they do provide a guideline for the design of our experiments and can be used to determine our protein properties from the data received with those experiments.
