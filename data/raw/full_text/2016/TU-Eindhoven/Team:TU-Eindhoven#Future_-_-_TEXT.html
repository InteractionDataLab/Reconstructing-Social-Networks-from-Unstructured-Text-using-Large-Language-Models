Future
The designed mutation sets were evaluated and the S71L mutation shows great potential. Even though the project has ended for us, our work will still be used. Staff members at our university have already taken great interest in our work and plan to incorporate it into their own PhD research.
Another part of this project was the tetramer, which was successfully synthesized at DNA level. It has not been expressed yet and no assays have been performed with it. Future research in the T14-3-3 tetramer offers many opportunities within the field of synthetic biology. It would be a universal scaffold that can regulate even more complex higher order protein dynamics than our heterodimer.
In the future our research can function as a basis for many applications in the field of synthetic biology and inspire other researchers and iGEM teams to create, improve or regulate their own systems with the help of our universal scaffold.
