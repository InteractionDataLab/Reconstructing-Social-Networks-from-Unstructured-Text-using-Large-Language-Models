My name is Stijn Hofstraat and I am a third year Biomedical Engineering student. Within the iGEM team I assist Marijn Kruit with the sponsoring and finances, I work a lot on the WIKI and I do a lot of the work that has to be done in the lab.  
</P><P>
I joined the iGEM team because I interested myself for the field of synthetic biology and wanted to increase my knowledge about this subject. Another reason to join the team was to experience working on a challenging research project and to develop my personal skills. I feel like joining the iGEM team was a great decision because I learned so much and I feel like we really accomplished something.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="P_Header"> Vera Koomen - Public Relations   </DIV><DIV id="H250" class="Content_Row"><DIV class="Column_60"><P>
I just started my third year of Medical Sciences and Technology at the Eindhoven University of Technology. In this year’s iGEM team, I am responsible for the PR and also part of the lab team. This means that I take care of the social media, I keep in touch with the iGEM Headquarters, and other contacts concerning our project.                      </P><P>
My interest for iGEM started during the course Molecular Cell Biology. I felt that participating in the iGEM competition would add something extra to my study: not only studying from books, but actually setting up our own project from scratch.                      </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="P_Header"> Carolien de Korte - Visual Identity  </DIV><DIV id="H250" class="Content_Row"><DIV class="Column_60"><P>
My name is Carolien de Korte. I am a third year Biomedical Engineering student. My responsibility in the iGEM team is “visual identity”. This means that I design all the visual objects we use for our wiki, clothing, posters, and presentations. I am also working in the lab.  

                    </P><P>
I joined the iGEM team because I wanted to experience what it would be like to be on a research team. With our team I am sure it will be a great experience!                      </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="P_Header"> Marijn Kruit - Treasurer/Sponsoring  </DIV><DIV id="H250" class="Content_Row"><DIV class="Column_60"><P>
Currently I am a third year Medical Sciences and Technology student at the Technical University of Eindhoven. I joined the iGEM team to gain more of insight in what I find most interesting within the field of Biomedical Engineering.                      </P><P>
With a bit of assistance from Stijn I take care of the financial aspect of our project. This includes searching for sponsors and maintaining a good relationship with them. Besides taking care of sponsoring and finances, I also help the team out in the lab.                      </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="P_Header"> Nynke de Leeuw - Team Captain    </DIV><DIV id="H250" class="Content_Row"><DIV class="Column_60"><P>
I am a student Medical Engineering and Technology at Eindhoven University of Technology and I just started the last year of my Bachelor’s degree. My team role is team captain and being part of the lab team.                       </P><P>
For me, joining the iGEM team this year was a big opportunity to improve my skills and broaden my knowledge about synthetic biology. In the future I definitely see myself working on similar projects as the project we are working on right now, so iGEM is a really nice first experience with starting up a research by ourselves.                     </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="P_Header"> Laura Rijns - Lab Captain </DIV><DIV id="H250" class="Content_Row"><DIV class="Column_60"><P>
My name is Laura Rijns and I am the lab captain of the team. This means that I am responsible for all the sequences we have designed and for the exciting experiments that we conduct. Currently, I am a third year undergraduate in Medical Sciences and Technology at the Technical University of Eindhoven.                      </P><P>
I joined the iGEM team because I was ready to face a challenging project and synthetic biology is a field that has my greatest interest. Furthermore, this is a great opportunity to learn some skills in the lab and to improve my role as a team member. I am also curious to discover the other areas that are involved in this project, like human practices, sponsoring and modelling. The final conference in Boston will make iGEM an unforgettable experience!                     </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="P_Header"> Tom van Sonsbeek - Policies and Practices    </DIV><DIV id="H250" class="Content_Row"><DIV class="Column_60"><P>
Currently I am a third year student Biomedical Engineering. I joined the iGEM team because it is a great opportunity to learn how to do scientific research in the very interesting field of synthetic biology. I also like that fact that we can design our project in the way we want to do it.                      </P><P>
I am responsible for the policy and practices part of this project and I am also part of the lab team. During this project I hope gain knowledge and experience about synthetic biology. After iGEM I want to do a master and PhD in the field of synthetic biology.                      </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="P_Header"> Bram van der Velden - WIKI Captain   </DIV><DIV id="H250" class="Content_Row"><DIV class="Column_60"><P>

I Joined the iGEM team because I want to put the skills I have gained so far to contribute to society. I see great potential in the field of synthetic biology, making the iGEM competition a perfect opportunity for doing so. Not only have I put my skills to the test, I have also expanded my knowledge more than I had imagined when starting this project.                      </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="Footer"><A href="#" class="back-to-top"> back to top</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
