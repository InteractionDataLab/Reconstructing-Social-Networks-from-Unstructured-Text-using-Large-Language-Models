Composite Part
A fully functioning Super Cell device
We created one composite part:
BBa_K2135003 - pTet-petF
Best Composite Part
This composite part is a combination of BBa_K2135001 and BBa_K2135002. This composite part allowed for the inducible production of ferredoxin when various concentrations of anhydrotetracycline (aTc) were added. We used this part to test at what concentration we got the most production of reduced ferredoxin. This part is our candidate for Best Composite Part.
