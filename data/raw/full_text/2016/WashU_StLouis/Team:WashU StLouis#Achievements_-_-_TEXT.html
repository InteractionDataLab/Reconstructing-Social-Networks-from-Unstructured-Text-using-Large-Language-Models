Medal Achievements
🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅
We believe that our iGEM project met the Gold Medal standards. See below how we met each medal requirement:
BRONZE
Register and attend
We registered for iGEM early in the spring, had an awesome and fun summer, and are very much looking forward to the Giant Jamboree in Boston!
Deliverables
We met all requirements!
Attribution
Our project would not have been possible without the help of our amazing mentors and advisors. Check out our attributions page to see how we all worked together.
Part
In addition to our silver medal part, we also submitted the following parts to the registry:
BBa_K2135000
BBa_K2135002
BBa_K2135003
SILVER
Validate new part
We validated a part that we created, BBa_K2135001 , showing that expressing petF in DH10B produced ferredoxin.
Collaboration
We mentored University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s first iGEM team. We guided them through iGEM requirements, provided them with funding and HP sources, and helped them any way we could! We had a blast working with them this summer and even got to meet each other at the iGEM Heartland Meetup! Check out our collaboration page to see who else we talked with this summer.
Human Practices
Throughout out the summer, we talked with important people in various fields related to our project. From farmers to environmentalists to industry researchers, our project grew and changed as we learned more from these people. Ultimately, they helped shape our project and move it towards its final state. Check out our Human Practices page to learn more!
GOLD
Improve a previous part or project
We improved the characterization of BBa_K873002 , an HSP promoter that had no previous data about its activity or activation temperature. We showed that it was only slightly activated at high temperatures and that its activity greatly decreased over time. Vilnius iGEM recreate our characterization protocol and got similar results.
Proof of concept
We conducted a proof of concept experiment to show that our Super Cells not only were able to overproduce reduced electron donors, but were also able to utilize them for a biological process. Our cells were able to overproduce biotin, a molecule that is synthesized in a reduced electron donor dependent pathway, when we overexpressed genes coding for ferredoxin, an electron donor, and pyruvate ferredoxin oxiodreductase, an enzyme that reduces the electron donor.
