Improving the registry one BioBrick at a time
The WashU-PSU iGEM team tested 2 genes of interest in order to overproduce ATP (pck and pgk) and 3 genes of interest in order to overproduce electron donors (fldA, petF, and pfo). This resulted in 6 total constructs: two for ATP and four for electron donors. From these constructs, pck produced the most ATP and petF (and petF-pfo) successfully produced reduced eletron donors. Because of this, we chose to turn these genes into BioBricks. Additionally, we decided to turn the inducible promoter from our electron donor constructs, pTet, into a BioBrick, which included its repressor protein, TetR. Previous parts had only the pTet promoter region, making it a constitutive promoter. Our part allows for pTet to be an inducible promoter, controlled by the addition of aTc. Finally, we created a composite part with petF and TetR-pTet, which was the relevant gene sequence in the petF construct.
Additionally, we characterized an HSP BioBrick that had no previous data for our Gold medal requirement.
