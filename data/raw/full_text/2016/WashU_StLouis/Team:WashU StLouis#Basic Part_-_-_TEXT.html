Basic Parts
The pieces needed to make a Super Cell
We created three basic parts:
BBa_K2135001 - petF
BBa_K2135000 - pck
BBa_K2135002 - TetR-pTet
Best Basic Part
The petF biobrick corresponds to the petF gene from Synechocystis. It codes for ferredoxin, an electron donor that is a reducing agent in many cellular reactions. We used this part to create an E. coli strain with increased reduced electron donors. petF was our best performing part and is our candidate for best Basic Part. Click on the parts link above to see why!
Additional BioBricks
The pck biobrick corresponds to the pck gene from E. coli MG1655. It codes for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, a kinase that works under gluconeogenic conditions to produce ATP. We used this part to create an E. coli strain with increased intracellular ATP.
The TetR-pTet biobrick is an inducible promoter. pTet is the promoter that is inhibited by TetR. When anhydrotetracycline (aTc) is added, TetR is removed and promoter activity ensues. We used this inducible promoter to fine tune our reduced electron donor activity.
