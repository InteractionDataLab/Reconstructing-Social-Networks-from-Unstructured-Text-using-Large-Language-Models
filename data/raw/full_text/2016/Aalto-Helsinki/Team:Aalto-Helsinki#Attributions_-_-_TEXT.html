Team
Emilia Broman - gathered funding for the team. She put her designing talents to use in the posters, webpage, wiki, CollabSeeker and project video. She was also part of the Interlab team.
Hele Haapaniemi - was mostly involved in the detection part and also did some construct design.
Saara Hiltunen - was responsible for funding and designed the posters, webpage, wiki, and CollabSeeker. She also carried out the Interlab experiments.
Rashad Ismayilzada - was involved in several aspects of the project, from Interlab to fundraising. He also took initiative in human practices.
Antti Koistinen - worked on the Venus yellow fluorescent protein, constructed the BioBricks and was also involved in modelling the detection mechanism.
Laura Laiho - was mainly involved in the degradation part, purifying the MlrA enzyme and analysing the toxin-enzyme reactions. She contributed to construct design and the stress response part of detection. She also made sketches for the video and worked on poster design.
Nidia Obscura - modelled the detection mechanism and did biochemical simulations.
Pihla Savola - carried out the detection part of the project and was involved in some of the degradation part, doing some enzyme purification. She was involved in designing and ordering the constructs.
Snehadri Sinha - worked on the degradation part of the project, producing the MlrA enzyme in E. coli and S. cerevisiae and then purifying it for downstream work. He narrated the project video.
Jami Valorinta -  was the computer science wizard - developing our webpage, wiki, CollabSeeker, WikiFire+, and also modelled the detection mechanism.
Other people
We would like to start with thanking Markus Linder, the primary PI of our project. He has been there for us right from the start, introducing us to the ways of iGEM and guiding us through the brainstorming and initial research stages. He helped us get in touch with experts and also arranged for some of our funding. We held weekly meetings with him almost during the whole project and got valuable advice on many matters. During different stages of the project we had several ideas on which direction to proceed in - he helped us recognize the more important things to focus on. He has also encouraged independent thinking amongst ourselves to maintain the student-driven aspect of the project. Lately, he has helped us a lot in preparing for the Giant Jamboree. His support has been invaluable in our iGEM journey.
Heli Viskari was our instructor and also there for us from the beginning. She answered all questions related to the lab and also arranged the lab space for us - so important for carrying out for our experiments! She helped with the FACS instrument and setup. She also regularly gave her input on our results and the progress of our project.
Merja Penttilä (VTT) encouraged us to think outside the box in our brainstorming sessions. As the secondary PI of our project, she gave us advice and direction when designing our project idea.
We had the opportunity to talk to Kaarina Sivonen and her cyanobacteria research group at the University of Helsinki. They really helped us by answering our questions, providing us with the cyanobacteria we used in our experiments and by analysing our enzyme activity samples. We were in contact especially with David Fewer, who is a researcher at the group. He helped us in planning the project and provided useful research articles. With his input we were able to design and carry out various laboratory experiments. Also, the group’s laboratory technician, Matti Wahlsten, helped us tremendously and we are very grateful to him for analysing all of our enzyme activity samples (there was a lot of them). He also gave us the safety training concerning working with the toxins and the cyanobacteria and how to handle and dispose of them. Without Matti’s help, we would have had to come up with some different way of analysing the enzyme activity in our samples, which most likely would have given us less time to spend on doing other things in the lab. As a gesture of thanks we decided to name the main character in our introduction video as Matti.
Jussi Jäntti (VTT) attended many of our brainstorming sessions and advised us, especially on the use yeast as a chassis. He also gave advice on designing transporters and the choice of fluorescent protein for the detection.
Alexander Frey (Aalto University) helped solve many of our problems related to yeast. He advised on signal sequences for our construct design. He also helped us with the choice of yeast strain and provided us with protocols for some of the yeast lab work.
Jorg de Ruijter (Aalto University, formerly) helped us tremendously with various everyday problems, especially with yeast-related work. He gave us yeast protocols and answered our questions about them, and advised on things to take into account in designing several of our yeast experiments. He also gave advice on yeast strains, plasmids, and designing the genome integration of the transporters.
Pezhman Mohammadi (Aalto University) was the go-to person whenever we faced problems with protein work, be it in the practical work or designing the experiment. He gave us useful advice on protein purification and helped choose parameters for FPLC. He advised us on homology modeling, codon optimization for the enzyme production, and also helped order the enzyme constructs.
Georg Schmidt (Aalto University) has answered our questions relating to DNA constructs design, and was the go-to person for any questions on cloning. He also helped us with PCR troubleshooting and advised on things to take into account with our microplate reader assay.
Dominik Mojzita (VTT) gave us advice related to stress reactions and yeast strain choices. He provided valuable input on yeast stress response, choice of linkers, enzyme activity controls, and also suggested the use of FACS.
Mari Piirainen (Aalto University) helped us with practical problems related to yeast, and also taught us how to use FACS.
Anssi Rantasalo (VTT) helped us with designing our transporter constructs and gave general advice on FACS and analyzing the results.
Anssi Rantasalo (VTT) helped us with designing our transporter constructs and gave general advice on FACS and analyzing the results.
Merja Oja (VTT) introduced us to the field of modelling and helped give direction to our modellers.
Ion Petre (Åbo Akademi) oriented us further into modelling and provided us with helpful example programs and models for our project.
Sami Havukainen (Aalto University) gave valuable advice us on choice of yeast strain and cloning, especially with Gibson assembly.
Filip Mollerup (Aalto University) gave input on ideas for scaling up enzyme production when we were developing our project idea, and later on in the project suggested ways to improve enzyme purification.
Salla Virtanen (Aalto University) showed how to use the microplate reader and gave advice on setting up our microplate reader fluorescence assay.
Martina Ikonen (Aalto University) also advised us on the setting up the microplate reader assay and  helped to develop and improve it.
Ekaterina Osmekhina (Aalto University) gave additional advice on parameters for the microplate reader, and informative ways to plot fluorescence measurement data.
Bart Rooijakkers (Aalto University) advised us on the choice of linkers and plasmids to use.
Sesilja Aranko (Aalto University) gave some general advice about designing and ordering DNA constructs.
Christopher Jonkergouw (Aalto University) helped us with sequencing.
The Aalto-Helsinki 2014 and 2015 teams gave us advice on how to start the project planning, how to acquire funding and on iGEM in general. Their help was really important, and we were able to turn to them when in doubt.
Our heartfelt thanks go to the aforementioned people and everyone else who supported us throughout our project. Whether you helped shape our project by sharing your thoughts with us, assisted with the everyday practicalities of our project, or gave moral support - we are immensely grateful to you all!
