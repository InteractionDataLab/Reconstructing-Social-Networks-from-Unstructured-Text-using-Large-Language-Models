Emilia Broman
Bioinformation Technology at Aalto University
In the beginning of the project I did a lot of fundraising and budgeting to make sure that the financial side of the project was taken care of. That followed by many hours spent on coding the CollabSeeker. I have also taken care of the visual part of our project, designing our wiki, posters etc. And finally, thanks to the InterLab study I did not have to spend the whole summer staring at my laptop!
I joined iGEM because I enjoy learning new things, and that's what iGEM is all about!
Hele Haapaniemi
Biosystems and Biomaterials Engineering at Aalto University
I have been doing mostly research and lab work related to the detection part of our project. Especially yeast transformations and catalase assays have become familiar during the summer. Besides this I have been presenting our project to many companies and tried to learn to code our wiki page.
I wanted to experience something new and learn more about synthetic biology. Work in a research project that is planned and realized by only ourselves sounded cool. And it was!
Saara Hiltunen
Bioinformation Technology at Aalto University
I was kind of a jack of all trades in the team. The beginning of the summer I mostly concentrated on funding and organizing our trips to Stockholm and Paris. Since then my responsibilities have also included coding wiki and Collabseeker, designing and some lab stuff.
I joined iGEM because it is a great opportunity to apply my interdisciplinary studies in the field of synthetic biology and learn loads of new things.
Rashad Ismayilzada
Bioinformatics at Aalto University
I joined iGEM to learn more about biology and lab work. I also wanted to participate in a project that incorporated in itself multifarious activities, such as fundraising, business development, research, lab work, modeling and programming.
My main contribution was helping to gather funds for the team and I can proudly say that we managed to do it well. Simultaneously, I was involved in human practices and public outreach. I also got to do some lab work and was in charge of the Interlab study. I would say in iGEM I learned to be more patient and rediscovered the meaning of perseverance.
Antti Koistinen
Biotechnology at Aalto University
I have mostly been working in lab with many projects including fluorescent protein testing in yeast and constructing our biobricks. I also did some modelling since somebody needs to teach biology to the mathematicians.
When I heard that you could be a part of research project where designing and execution is done by students I knew this is something I want to participate in. A little bit more researching about previous year's iGEM projects, and the opportunities of synthetic biology got me completely hooked.
Laura Laiho
Molecular Biosciences at the University of Helsinki
In the background research and lab I constituted one half of the degradation team. Outside the lab I, as our team captain, tried to keep everything on track and make sure that we were getting stuff done. I also held presentations to companies and drew the pictures for our introduction video.
I joined iGEM because I wanted to do something awesome, learn new stuff and see what a team full of students can achieve - a lot apparently! I came to iGEM knowing quite little about synthetic biology, but now I am confident that my future career will be in this field of science.
Nidia Obscura
Mathematics at the University of Helsinki
I worked on the modelling of the detecting mechanism of our project. I modelled mathematically the potential activity of our promoters and their mechanisms through a theoretical model and some simulations.
I joined IGEM to learn more about the state of the art in synthetic biology and how mathematics could be of help in a task -I thought- so distant. I was pretty excited of applying my knowledge in a very interdisciplinary team.
Pihla Savola
Biotechnology and Chemical Technology at Aalto University
My main responsibility has been to make sure everything is moving forward in the lab. This has meant lots of lab planning, background research and experiment design, as well as making sure lab work is distributed and everyone knows what to do. And of course, plenty of the actual lab work too!
I wanted to work on an independent, challenging research project where I could apply what I know and do lots of problem-solving, so a student-driven team project seemed like a good fit. And I wanted to learn more about synthetic biology, which made iGEM an even better match!
Snehadri Sinha
Molecular Biosciences at the University of Helsinki
I have been doing background research and working in the lab, focusing on the degradation part of the project. It has been a summer of growth media and Western blots for me. Other than that, I worked on presentations and the introduction video.
I joined iGEM because the opportunity to work in a trendy field like synthetic biology and that too in a student-led team seemed too good to miss! It’s one of the best decisions I have taken this year. During the hours spent in the lab I learnt much about time management and planning. After iGEM I have a newfound enthusiasm for facing challenges.
Jami Valorinta
Mathematics at the University of Helsinki
Spring 2016. I saw a poster in the hallways of Kumpula, advertising a synthetic biology competition I had never heard of. I was     a mathematician with only a vague idea of what synthetic biology even meant, so of course I immediately applied... and got chosen!
In the team I've mostly been doing everything related to computers. I'm the guy responsible for our website, the backend of the CollabSeeker,     and the WikiFire+ tool used by our wiki group. I also did modelling and helped with the numerical simulations, and the others even let me into     the lab a couple of times. It's really been a great summer!

Advisors
Markus Linder
Aalto University
Our mentor, Markus Linder, is a professor leading the Biomolecular materials group at Aalto University in the department of Biotechnology and Chemical technology. He has mentored the previous Aalto-Helsinki teams.
Heli Viskari
Aalto University
Our instructor, Heli Viskari, is a university lectuer in Aalto University. She has been helping us with various everyday problems throughout the summer. She was the instructor also for the previous Aalto-Helsinki team.
Acknowledgements
We would like to start with thanking Markus Linder , the primary PI of our project. He has been there for us right from the start, introducing us to the ways of iGEM and guiding us through the brainstorming and initial research stages. He helped us get in touch with experts and also arranged for some of our funding. We held weekly meetings with him almost during the whole project and got valuable advice on many matters. During different stages of the project we had several ideas on which direction to proceed in - he helped us recognize the more important things to focus on. He has also encouraged independent thinking amongst ourselves to maintain the student-driven aspect of the project. Lately, he has helped us a lot in preparing for the Giant Jamboree. His support has been invaluable in our iGEM journey.
Heli Viskari was our instructor and also there for us from the beginning. She answered all questions related to the lab and also arranged the lab space for us - important for carrying out for our experiments! She helped with the flow cytometer instrument and setup. She also regularly gave her input on our results and the progress of our project.
Merja Penttilä (VTT) encouraged us to think outside the box in our brainstorming sessions. As the secondary PI of our project, she gave us advice and direction when designing our project idea.
We had the opportunity to talk to Kaarina Sivonen and her cyanobacteria research group at the University of Helsinki. They really helped us by answering our questions, providing us with the cyanobacteria we used in our experiments and by analysing our enzyme activity samples. We were in contact especially with David Fewer , who is a researcher at the group. He helped us in planning the project and provided useful research articles. With his input we were able to design and carry out various laboratory experiments. Also, the group’s laboratory technician, Matti Wahlsten , helped us tremendously and we are very grateful to him for analysing all of our enzyme activity samples (there was a lot of them). He also gave us the safety training concerning working with the toxins and the cyanobacteria and how to handle and dispose of them. Without Matti’s help, we would have had to come up with some different way of analysing the enzyme activity in our samples, which most likely would have given us less time to spend on doing other things in the lab. As a gesture of thanks we decided to name the main character in our introduction video as Matti.
In addition to our official advisors and the cyanobacteria research group, we would like to acknowledge the following people for their contribution to our project:
Jussi Jäntti (VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland) attended many of our brainstorming sessions and advised us, especially on the use yeast as a chassis. He also gave advice on designing transporters and the choice of fluorescent protein for the detection.
Alexander Frey (Aalto University) helped solve many of our problems related to yeast. He advised on signal sequences for our construct design. He also helped us with the choice of yeast strain and provided us with protocols for some of the yeast lab work.
Jorg de Ruijter (Aalto University) helped us tremendously with various everyday problems, especially with yeast-related work. He gave us yeast protocols and answered our questions about them, and advised on things to take into account in designing several of our yeast experiments. He also gave advice on yeast strains, plasmids, and designing the genome integration of the transporters.
Pezhman Mohammadi (Aalto University) was the go-to person whenever we faced problems with protein work, be it in the practical work or designing the experiment. He gave us useful advice on protein purification and helped choose parameters for FPLC. He advised us on homology modeling, codon optimization for the enzyme production, and also helped order the enzyme constructs.
Georg Schmidt (Aalto University) has answered questions we had relating to DNA constructs design, and was the go-to person for any questions on cloning. He also helped us with PCR troubleshooting and advised on things to take into account with our microplate reader assay.
Dominik Mojzita (VTT) gave us advice related to stress reactions and yeast strain choices. He provided valuable input on yeast stress response, choice of linkers, enzyme activity controls, and also suggested the use of flow cytometry.
Mari Piirainen (Aalto University) helped us with practical problems related to yeast, and also taught us how to use a flow cytometer.
Anssi Rantasalo (VTT) helped us with designing our transporter constructs and gave general advice on flow cytometry and analyzing the results.
Merja Oja (VTT) introduced us to the field of modelling and helped give direction to our modellers.
