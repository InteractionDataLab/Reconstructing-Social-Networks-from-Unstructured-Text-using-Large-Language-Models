What is Cas-Find?
Cas-Find is a point-of-care diagnostic tool using the CRISPR-Cas9 system with the potential to radically change the speed of disease diagnosis, with a particular focus on the detection of sexually transmitted infections (STI’s).
Why STI's?
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including those caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, remain an important focus area for global public health. This is due to the high morbidity associated with STIs, such as the sequelae of reproductive tract infections, cervical cancer, congenital syphilis, ectopic pregnancy and infertility, as well as the morbidity of HIV-related illness and death from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
More than 30 bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens are transmissible sexually and constitute a group of infections referred to as sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Although some of the pathogens can be acquired through routes other than sexual transmission, epidemiologically, sexual contact is more important for their transmission from one person to another (See Table 1 for information on the main sexually transmitted pathogens).

What is point-of-care testing?
Point-of-care testing (POCT): ‘tests designed to be used at or near the site where the patient is located, that do not require permanent dedicated space, and that are performed outside the physical facilities of the clinical laboratories’ i.e. testing at the time and place of patient care (Santrach 2007).
What are the potential benefits of point-of-care tests?
With the aim of POCT to bring the test conveniently and immediately to the patient it increases the likelihood of the physician and patient receiving results more quickly and allowing immediate clinical management decisions to be made. Rapid decision making, reduced number of outpatient clinic visits, reduced number of hospital beds required and occupied, overall ensuring the optimal use of professional time.
When used for diagnosis, the time required for test results to become available to guide management should be considered when choosing which test to use, since infected persons may transmit infections to others, may suffer complications of infection, or may be lost to follow-up in the interval between testing and notification of test results
How do POCT’s compare to other laboratory tests?
Laboratory-based tests, such as culture or nucleic acid amplification testing, may require special methods of specimen transport and specialized equipment and procedures for optimal performance, thus delaying the availability of results for immediate management decisions. Therefore laboratory-based diagnosis of STIs tends to be expensive in terms of equipment, reagents, infrastructure, and maintenance. Even more importantly, particularly in resource- constrained settings, the levels where most patients with STIs are processed have no laboratory facilities. (Peeling et.al. 2006)
Where can POCT’s have the greatest impact?
In countries with a high burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), where laboratory services for STIs are either not available or limited services are available and patients may not be able to physically access or to pay for these services.
Currently in many high risk 3rd world countries the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends the use of syndromic management where patients are treated for all the major causes of a particular syndrome. Syndromic management of STIs works well for urethral discharge, pelvic pain, and genital ulcer disease, but evaluations of the WHO flowcharts have shown that the algorithm for vaginal discharge lacks both sensitivity and specificity for the identification of women with Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. Simple, affordable, rapid tests that can be performed at the point-of-care (POC) and enable treatment and case management decision to be made are urgently needed for these infections (Unemo 2013). Simple rapid POC tests are needed not only to increase the specificity of syndromic management, and reduce over-treatment of genital gonococcal and chlamydial infections but also to screen for asymptomatic STIs. A mathematical model estimated that a test for syphilis that requires no laboratory infrastructure could save more than 201,000 lives and avert 215,000 stillbirths per year worldwide. A similar test could save approximately 4 million disability- adjusted life years (DALYs), avert more than 16.5 million incident gonorrhoea and chlamydial infections and prevent more than 212,000 HIV infections per year (Unemo 2013).
What makes a good POCT?
The ideal rapid test - ASSURED criteria
A = Affordable
S = Sensitive
S = Specific
U = User-friendly (simple to perform in a few steps with minimal training)
R = Robust and rapid (can be stored at room temperature and results available in <30 minutes)
E = Equipment-free or minimal equipment that can be solar- or battery-powered
Are there any current POCT tests?
Yes! Many are in current circulation, some examples being:
Glucose
Blood gas analysis/electrolytes
Activated clotting time for high dose heparin monitoring
Urine dipsticks, including pregnancy
Occult blood
Haemoglobin
Rapid strep
Current Principles of rapid point-of-care test technologies for STI’s:
Agglutination reactions to detect antigen or antibody
Immunochromatographic tests (ICT’s)
Microfluidic assays
Rapid molecular assays
Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)
Helicase dependent amplification (HDA)
Cross priming amplification (CPA)
Rolling circle amplification (RCA)
Can I have an example of how Cas-Find would be useful?
Lets take one of the most common sexually transmitted infections in the UK affecting on average 200,000 people each year, chlamydia (PHE 2015). Currently to test for this infection you take either a urine sample or swab to determine if the chlamydia bacteria (Chlamydia trachomatis) is present. Analysing the samples involves using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) such as PCR or by growing a chlamydia culture. Cultures incur high costs, have varying sensitivity and limitations for widespread screening whilst both methods are laborious and often time consuming. Cas-Find aims to reduce the time to disease detection. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system specific sequences on the suspect bacteria can be immediately detected, emitting a measureable fluorescence if present. This point-of-care nature of our project can significantly advantage those where lab access if limited, expensive and the speed of diagnosis is crucial in making the appropriate clinical decisions.
