NOTEBOOK
Foreword
We were the first Cardiff University team to enter iGEM, and only 2 of our PIs had experience with synthetic biology, so there was a steep learning curve, hence we sought out assistance when required. From this project we will have gained valuable insight, and are well placed to mentor future Welsh teams.
As a smaller team than most, all members got dirty in the lab to some degree, as well as giving a hand in public engagement events. That said, there were still defined roles in the team.
