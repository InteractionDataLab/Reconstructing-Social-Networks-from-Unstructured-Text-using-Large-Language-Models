			commercial release of GMOs into the environment. When GMOs end up 
			in the environment, they can have unintended consequences for it. 
			Genetically modified micro-organisms are able to reproduce and 
			establish themselves as permanent populations and there can be 
			subtle and long-term effects on the biological communities and 
			ecosystems. Results of DNA modifications can’t be limited to the 
			replacement of the specific characteristics of its gene. Therefore, 
			it is important that when these organisms are released into nature, 
			they don’t harm the environment or form any risk to human health. 
			Such problems have led to a broader interest in the theme of risk 
			assessment in the release of GMOs.</P><P>Synthetic biology is a new field, which is different from 
			engineering genetics and working in the lab. We have to assume that 
			our target consumers are probably not all familiar with biology. 
			All in all, a cautious approach is needed. We need to assess the 
			environmental risks of our iGEM project that might arise from the 
			introduction of recombinant organisms.</P></DIV><DIV class="right flone"><FIGCAPTION> Of course we were wearing our labcoats at all times.

			it” – <STRONG>Craig Venter</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Synthetic biology is one of the most developing and emerging 
			technologies to date. <SUP id="ref-1"><A href="#cite-1">[1]</A></SUP> The field of synthetic biology is 
			continuously developing. As in iGEM, real-world applications are 
			constantly shifting ideas, more research becomes available. There 
			is only a pressing concern, especially with the microbial systems. 
			Genetically modified bacteria may produce undesired consequences if 
			they are released into the environment</P><P>In order to provide an idea of the risks possible of releasing 
			GMO in the environment, risk should be assessed. In this special 
			case of our project, we should not only assess the safety risks but 
			also the security risks </P><P>In general, there are two potential hazards considered 
			generally; successful competition against other natural strains and 
			horizontal gene transfer from engineered bacteria to natural 
			strains. <SUP id="ref-2"><A href="#cite-2">[2]</A></SUP> Natural strains have less changes compared with GMO’s 
			considered their fitness. For example, most designed bacteria 
			contain antibiotic resistance cassettes in their plasmid, which are 
			used for the cell forcing to keep an insert plasmid. In absence of 
			selection a plasmid can be discarded by its host. <SUP id="ref-3"><A href="#cite-3">[3]</A></SUP> Therefore, 
			due to horizontal gene transfer, some engineered genes might could 
			have been taken up by other bacteria, which also could lead to 
			competition with other strains. Both situations end up creating a 
			natural imbalance between species. </P><P>There are several regulations regarding genetically modified 
			bacteria. The one that applies to us are the ones about working 
			safely with GMO’s and the <A href="/ Team:Groningen/HP/Legal">sending of GMO’s</A>. Following these rules should be taken seriously. </P><P>Over time, the lack of evolutionary stability of synthetic DNA 
			might serve as safety itself. A synthetic bacteria could change to 
			a near wild-type state, thank to pseudo-restoration. <SUP id="ref-4"><A href="#cite-4">[4]</A></SUP> But there 
			is current consensus that multiple safety mechanisms are needed to 
			ensure that risks are lowered in case of component inactivation. 
			<SUP id="ref-5"><A href="#cite-5">[5]</A></SUP></P><P>We designed a kill-switch to prevent against the two potential 
			hazards. This kill-switch in under a constructive promotor which is 
			always on, unless suppressed. If the spores are released in nature 
			they will not germinate, because of tetracycline deficiency. Under 
			the control of PtetR, the nuclease is translated, which is capable 
			of digesting extracellular genetic material. This means that 
			horizontal gene transfer isn’t a possibility. </P><P>Looking at the security aspects, both applications in the 
			kill-switch are also to prevent that  unauthorized parties gain our 
			spores with the message or key. If the unauthorized receiver tries 
			to grow the spores without the right compounds, the kill-switch 
			will be activated and the message or key will be digested by the 
			NucA. This makes our system should be safe and secure. </P></SECTION><SECTION><H3>Safe by Design: RIVM</H3><DIV class="split"><DIV class="left flone"><P>The RIVM, The National Institute for Public Health and Environment, challenged us to go beyond the safety forms of iGEM. By inviting iGEM teams from the Netherlands to present an implementation of Safe-by-Design, they wish to improve safety. At the first meeting with the RIVM, we presented our plan for safety in our project, by which we implemented by the Safe-by-Design concept.</P><P>On Tuesday 21th of September we had a second gathering entitled  “Safely continue with synthetic biology” with all Dutch iGEM Teams, the RIVM and the Rathenau Institute. Here we presented our project and what our final implementations were of “Safe-by-Design”. The purpose of Safe-by-Design is to make sure that all the safety aspects have been considered during the design stage of your product. This made Safe-by-Design the topic of the day.</P></DIV><DIV class="right flone"><FIGCAPTION>Figure 1. Photo taken during the meeting on 21th of September.</FIGCAPTION></DIV></DIV><P>The afternoon was initiated by prof. Dr. Erik Lebret,  Risk Assessment researcher at the RIVM and Dr. ir. Melanie Peters, director of the Rathenau Institute. Erik Lebret gave the kick-off by stressing the importance of incorporating risk management from the beginning of the manufacturing process development. Whether Melanie Peters emphasized the responsibilities after fabricating, because safety isn’t only a matter of engineering.</P><P>This day we also spoke about the ethics side of safe by design in the application of biotechnology. According to Sabine Roeser, ethics professor at TU Delft, emotions and art are the sources of ethical in Safe-by-Design.</P><P>At the end of the day we had workshops about previous iGEM projects and discussed several important safety aspects of these projects. Perhaps we should sometimes consider whether biotechnology solutions are the best solutions.</P><P>This day highlighted a lot of safety aspects iGEM, and compelled us to consider safety and security while working on our project.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H6>References</H6><UL><LI id="cite-1"><A href="#ref-1">[1]</A> Synthetic biology has
