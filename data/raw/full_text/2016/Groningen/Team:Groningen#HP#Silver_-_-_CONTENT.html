				solution.</P><P>CryptoGErM is a system for the storing and safe-sending of 
				information. By making use of the first purpose, we could store the 
				whole current information contained in books, newspapers, articles and 
				other physical paper-based within bacteria to reduce the 
				space needed for the storing of such information. Bacteria, such 
				<EM>Bacillus subtilis</EM> is able to store up to 1.5 GB of

				space of 186,000 square meter. If this information is stored into DNA, 
				it would only occupy 0.0002 mm<SUP>3</SUP>.</P><P>Furthermore, storing int DNA is more eco-friendly, because it does 
				not require any specific medium to keep it functional, in contrast with 
				current magnetic and optical storage medium that requires energetic 
				supply to continue working. Just in 2015, 416.2 terawatt hours of

		According to this work, DNA storage has a higher
