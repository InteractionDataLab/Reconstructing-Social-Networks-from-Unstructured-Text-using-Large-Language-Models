Future Perspectives
CryptoGErM is a highly robust and versatile system for secure     storage and transfer of data which exploits two key properties of     DNA; very high storage density and durability [1] . The system can     be developed further to make it even more secure, practical and     easy to use. In this section, we will discuss several possible     improvements for the CryptoGErM system.
Additional Biological Security Layers
Whether our system is used as a storage medium for blueprints of     military facilities or the script for a new Star Wars movie,     reliable biological security layers must be in place to prevent     unauthorized access. Retrieval of information from a DNA-based     archive should also be restricted to avoid alteration or deletion     of data. There are a number of biological lock systems to choose     from, and these can be combined to obtain a customizable security     system. Here we give a brief overview of future possibilities.
Decoy strains
A small amount of key carrying spores are mixed with a large     amount of decoy spores that do not contain the key or a biological     lock system. If they are not treated correctly, the decoy strains     outcompete the key strain, making it nearly impossible to find the     DNA sequence containing the key. This system is meant to be     combined with other biological security precautions described     below.
Essential gene under inducible promoter
An essential gene, such as atpA (ATP synthase subunit alpha) or acsA (acetyl coenzyme A synthetase) can be placed under a     chemically regulated promoter, such as TetR. The constitutively     expressed copy of that gene must be deleted from the genome.     Addition of the inducer compound (in this case aTc) leads to     transcription of the essential gene, allowing the bacteria to grow. atpA is a good choice for this system because it is expressed early     on in the cell growth cycle [2] , and is required for the cell to     live [2] . acsA is also a good choice, since it plays a central role     in metabolism [3] and is expressed early in the growth cycle [3] .     Additionally, since some acetyl coenzyme A is already present in Bacillus subtilis spores [3] , the cells can be expected survive the     brief period after germination and before the induction of acsA transcription. In this scenario the correct inducer compound must     be known in order to culture the strain containing the key. Thus,     the data cannot be accessed without the addition of this compound     to the growth medium.
Competition system
The key strain is resistant to a particular antibiotic, while a     competing strain (mixed in with the key strain) is not. The     competing strain produces an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) against     the key strain. Addition of the correct antibiotic to the growth     medium prior to culturing kills the competing strain, allowing the     key strain to grow. If no antibiotic is present, the competing     strain grows, produces the AMP and kills the key strain. If the     wrong antibiotic is added both strains die. Either way, without the     correct antibiotic, the key strain will not grow.
Database of photoswitchable antibiotics and inducer compounds
Although the photoswitchable antibiotic used in our project     responds only to UV light, it is possible to make photoswitches     respond to other wavelengths via molecular engineering techniques.     For example, a red light responsive azobenzene switch has been     developed by Woolley and co-workers, who substituted the four     positions ortho to the azo group with bulky, electron-rich     substituents [4] .
Molecular photoswitches can be conjugated to a variety of other     compounds in addition to antibiotics [5] . We envision a wide     variety of antibiotics and inducer compounds that respond to a     range of wavelengths, which could be selected from a database to     fit the user’s purpose. A collection of such photoresponsive     compounds could serve as a simple but effective method to protect     data encoded in the DNA of a micro-organism from unauthorized     access.
To simplify the process, it may eventually be possible to embed     a dry mixture of spores, LB powder and the photoresponsive compound     in filter paper, so that the user only has to add the right volume     of water and expose the mixture to the right wavelength of light in     order to retrieve the stored information.
Biometric identification with toehold switches
Germination of key strain spores is controlled by a toehold     switch, designed to respond to a particular RNA unique to the     recipient [6] . The switch represses growth by preventing the     translation of an essential gene, such as acsA. When the RNA is     added to the culture, the toehold switch no longer represses the     essential gene, allowing the bacteria to grow. The RNA could be     introduced into the culture by adding the recipient’s blood, or it     could purified from the blood and then added to the medium. This     method is a form of molecular biometric identification, which     ensures that the key can only be accessed by the recipient.
Indexing for easy searching
Archives are vast collections of information. Any archive, be it     on paper or in DNA, needs an indexing system to help find and     retrieve specific parts of the stored information. Without such a     system, it could take months or even years to sift through all the     data and find the relevant part. Thus, indexing systems are     essential in any archive platform. In simple terms, indexing     generates metadata about each file, which is then organized in a     searchable database. The index database can be stored separately,     or together with the data in the archive. In a DNA-based archival     system, the indices are coupled to primers designed to amplify     specific sections of the DNA sequence [7] . A database of primers     with a brief description of the data they access would be     indispensable for such an archival system.
Naked DNA for greater storage capacity
Although DNA inside spores has a longer shelf-life than naked     DNA, it suffers from a notable disadvantage that is not presented     by naked DNA: it contains sequences necessary for the replication     and metabolism of the host organism, and as a result, leaves less     room for data. If the data does not need to be preserved for     millions of years, it may be more feasible to encode it in naked     DNA as the storage capacity is far greater. If packaged and     preserved correctly, the DNA containing the data can last for     millennia [8] .
Packaged DNA for greater durability
If our system is adapted for use as a timecapsule, the     information should not be encrypted. Therefore, a second strain     carrying the decryption key is not needed, simplifying the system.     The shelf-life of the timecapsule can be greatly increased by     encasing the spores in silica spheres [9] . Additionally, genes     encoding intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) can be introduced     into the host’s genome, in such a way that they are expressed     during sporulation. These proteins originate from highly resilient     microscopic animals called tardigrades, and form a glass-like     substance when dehydrated [10] . This ‘bioglass’ protects DNA and     membrane integrity, and has been demonstrated to increase tolerance     to dehydration by 100% - 200% when expressed in E. coli [10] .     Another interesting protein unique to tardigrades is the Damage     suppressor (Dsup) protein. This DNA-associating protein protects     DNA from ionizing radiation, and has been shown to increase     tolerance to X-rays by 40% when expressed in human cells [11] .     Addition of extra DNA repair systems in our host can further     increase the shelf-life by correcting any mutations that have     occurred [12] . If all of these measures are taken, the resulting silica-encased spores can be placed in a lead container and locked     in an underground vault (such as the Svalbard Global Seed Vault)     preserving the information for millions of years.
