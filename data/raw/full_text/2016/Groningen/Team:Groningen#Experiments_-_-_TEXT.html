Experiments
The biological realization of CryptoGErM consisted of four     subprojects: integration, characterization, key hiding and key     deletion. The encrypted message and the key were integrated into     the genome of B. subtilis. The location in the genomic DNA     makes it harder to retrieve the data, since whole genome sequencing     is required. The message is protected by a digital lock: the key,     and thus doesn’t need further biological protection. The key is not     encrypted and has to be protected by a biological lock. We followed     different approaches to design a multi-layered biological lock. We     followed two main ideas, namely hiding the key and deleting the key     when unauthorized parties handle it. This system is highly flexible     and biological layers can easily be added or modified to the wishes     of the user. An overview of all the protocols and plasmid construction can be found in the Lab journal .
Integration
The first subproject is the integration, the key and message       sequences were integrated into the genomic DNA of two separate Bacillus subtilis strains. In order to achieve this we had the key       and the message sequence synthesized by IDT. Then we cloned it in       pSB1C3 to amplify it from there and cloned it in the B. subtilis integration biobrick BBa_K823023 . This  vector can be used to       integrate sequences into the amyE locus of Bacillus subtilis. From       there we integrated it in the genome of B. subtilis 168 trp+. For       message and key transmission these B. subtilis strains were       sporulated. We were able to successfully retrieve and read out our message.

Characterization
The integration vector from team LMU Munich       BacillusBiobrickbox 2012 ( BBa_K823023 )       can be used to integrate an insert into the amyE locus of B. subtilis. In order to be able to efficiently       use this integration vector we characterized BBa_K823023 by       determining its transformation efficiency. This helped us       in our project and will hopefully help future iGEM teams as       well.

Key hiding
Decoy
Hiding the key became called the decoy approach.The key-containing spore will be send in a mixture       of different decoy spores. The recipient has to be aware of       the special treatment that is required to select the       correct spores from the decoy. We have been working on a photoswitchable ciprofloxacin compound.
Only the knowledge about the right wavelength allows the       recipient to activate the added ciprofloxacin and thus       start selection of the right spore strain.
Our design of the decoy approach included the biobricks       for ciprofloxacin resistance, a superfolder GFP and a pATP       promotor.

MIC and MBC values of ciprofloxacin
We determined the MIC and MBC of ciprofloxacin on       wild-type Bacillus subtilis 168 as well as the MIC       of E. coli Top 10 and B. subtilis 168       carrying the qnrS1 ciprofloxacin resistance gene.       We could observe  a significant improvement in antibiotic       tolerance when compared to the MIC values of the wild-type       strains. Additionally we obtained a B. subtilis 168 isolate by directed evolution which is even more       resistant to ciprofloxacin.

Key deletion
NucA key deletion
Another biological security layer is provided by our key       deletion system. This assures that only authorized parties       can access the key. We have been working on two different       approaches. The first is a nucA killswitch which is made       out of an assembly of different BioBricks. ATc or       tetracycline have to be added to inhibit the tetR promoter       to stop the expression of the nucA and digestion of the key       sequence.
CRISPR/Cas9 key deletion
The second approach makes use of a CRISPR/Cas9 system       which will delete the key from the genome if no special       treatment is applied. Addition of aTc or tetracycline will       stop the Cas9 expression.
