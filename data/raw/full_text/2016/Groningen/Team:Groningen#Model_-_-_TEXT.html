Modelling
During the CryptoGErM project we came across several problems and    questions that we could not solve in the lab. Therefore we made use of    several different modelling approaches. Using artificial intelligence,    mathematical models and protein-DNA interaction models we could draw    essential conclusions for our project.
Belief-Desire-Intention Model
We asked ourselves what happens if someone tries to hack our      system (see photo). How would this person behave? Using an      artificial intelligence (AI) model, we explored the behaviour      of the people who use, or try to abuse, the CryptoGErM system.      The people are modelled in a multi-agent simulation using      genetic algorithms. This model helps us to predict the and      intentions of the users and intruders of our system.

Random mutations in Bacillus subtilis
We realized a random mutation would be unpleasant (see      photo) in our CryptoGErM project. The data stored in the      CryptoGErM system might be endangered by random mutations in      the DNA. This article contains research of the literature on      known mutation rates of B. subtilis under the special      conditions and treatments that will be applied.

Random mutations modelling
After exploring the mutation rates in B. subtilis,      we asked how will they affected our encrypted message and key      in the genome. Therefore in this section, we computationally      modelled the probability of random mutation causing our message      in the DNA to be corrupted.
Read more about the random mutations modelling.
Decoding fidelity
Our sequence of the encrypted message is integrated in the      genome of B. subtilis, but how sure can we be that we      get the same sequence back using common techniques. In the      decoding fidelity section we explore how accurate the current      sequencing techniques are and how strong our decoy encryption      security layer is.
Read more about decoding fidelity.
Searching for an optimal strain
We plan to hide our key sequence in one B. subtilis strain, which is mixed with decoy B. subtilis spores.      To select the key strain we found the photoswitchable      antibiotic spirofloxacin as an interesting option. We modelled      the protein-DNA interactions in order to search for an optimal      strain for our photoswitchable antibiotic experiments.
