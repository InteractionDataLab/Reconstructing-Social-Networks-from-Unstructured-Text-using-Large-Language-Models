Encoding & Encryption
This page demonstrates the encoding and encryption part of    CryptoGErM. You can enter a message and a key to encrypt it with in the    two boxes below. Click the transform button to go through the steps    that the encoder takes to make the DNA sequence.
You can take the final message sequence over to the Decoding machine and decode & decrypt it with the same key you entered here. The inner workings of    this machine are explained in the Software article.
