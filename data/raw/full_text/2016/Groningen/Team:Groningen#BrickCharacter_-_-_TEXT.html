Transformation Efficiency of B.subtilis plasmid backbone    ( BBa_K823023 ) created by iGEM LMU Munich 2012
The integration vector from team LMU Munich BacillusBiobrickbox    2012 ( BBa_K823023 ) can be used to integrate an insert of interest    in B. subtilis. The cloned insert will be integrated within the    amyE locus in B. subtilis after transformation (see figure 1 for    the integration locus). The amyE gene encodes for the alpha-amylase    protein, which degrades starch. After transformation with BBa_K823023 , the AmyE locus will be interrupted by the insert. The    successful integration disrupts the  ability of the bacteria to    degrade starch.
Two strains of B. subtilis were chosen to test the    transformation efficiency - B. subtilis 168 trp+ and B. subtilis 168 trp-. Each strain was transformed with three different    concentrations of BBa_K823023 ; 1 µg/ml, 100 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml. This    experiment was  done in triplicate. The transformation was    performed as indicated in Transformation of B. subtilis and colonies    were selected on LB agar plates containing 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol.    Subsequently 9 colonies were screened for correct integration of    K823023 with the starch test Integration check: Starch test . They were grown on    agar plates containing starch. The amylase activity of amyE is    visible as a clear zone (halo) after addition of lugol’s iodine    suggests the amyE gene was still intact and functional, which leads    to the conclusion that the integration was unsuccessful. The    colonies not forming the distinctive halo suggests a successful    integration into amyE, disrupting its amylase activity which    degrades starch.
Results
From the transformed bacteria suspension 50 µl were plated on LB    agar plates with 5 µl/ml chloramphenicol. All the plates had colony    formation, as seen in figure 1 and 2.

After addition of lugol’s iodine, there were no clear zones    around any B. subtilis colonies, see figure 3. This result    demonstrated that the amyE locus in B. subtilis had been replaced    successfully. Apart from this transformation efficiency experiment,    our team has been using BBa_K823023 as a plasmid backbone for our    message and key for integration in B. subtilis.
Fig. 3 Addition of lugol’s iodine to colonies grown     on starch plates. There is only growth on the left plate 3,4     and 9. On the right plate there is only growth on 1,7 and 9.     The other colonies might died from a too heat inoculation loop.
In addition, the colonies in the plates were counted. Plates    which contain a lot of colonies were divided in 16 areas as seen in    figure 4. The area with the estimated average amount of colonies    were counted.
Fig. 4 counting colonies after transformation.
For the counted colonies the transformation efficiency is    calculated with the following formula:
(# Colonies on plate/ng of DNA plated) X 1000 ng/µg =    CFU/µg of DNA
The amount ng of DNA plated, could be calculated with the following:
Volume of plasmid used in µL x concentration of DNA in    ng/µl x (volume plated / total reaction volume)
The first calculation is given as example:
400 µl of bacteria suspension is transformed with 3,6 µl    plasmid. This plasmid had a concentration of 276 ng/µl. The plated    volume is 50 µl. The mean of the amount of colonies overnight was    1882,7 cfu.
The result of the calculation is:
(3,6 µl * 276) * (50 µl / 403,6 µl) ≈ 123 ng DNA    plated
(1882,7 colonies / 123 ng plated DNA) * 1000 ng/µg =    1,5E+04 CFU/µg of DNA.
The results are summarised in the  graphs below:
Fig. 5. Results of the transformation      efficiency. The mean amount of colonies has been used to      calculate the CFU/µg DNA.
Fig. 6 Results of the transformation      efficiency. The mean amount of colonies has been used to      calculate the CFU/µg DNA.
We can infer from the graphs that lower amount of DNA resulted    in higher colony forming units. The recommendation is not to use    1000 ng of DNA for transformation with BBa_K823023 . Using 100 ng or    10 ng DNA for transformation would be slightly better.
