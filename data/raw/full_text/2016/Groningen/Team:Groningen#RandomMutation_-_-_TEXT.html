Random Mutation
Special attention has been given during the modelling to the     issue of random mutations. This particular phenomenon is related to     the random modification of some of the ACTG components of the     genome. Even though the reasons why this happens are unknown, the     impact that these switches have on the DNA of Bacillus subtilis are very relevant in the CryptoGErM project. This is mainly related     to the computational reasons that govern the encryption process of     the data that is saved into the bacteria, in fact if even one     single DNA component mutates it will be impossible to decrypt the     message and get the original message back. The same is also true     for the key, if one bit doesn’t correspond to the original ones,     the key is not going to work on the encrypted message. In order to     be sure that the message that we have stored into the genome     wouldn’t have been affected by a random mutation we have ran some     computational simulations that reproduce this phenomenon.
The original length of Bacillus subtilis DNA corresponds to     4.215.619 base pairs, on the other side the length of the Sherlock     Holmes quote that we have stored in the bacteria has a total length     of 556 base pairs. The computational model simulates the random     mutation in the DNA by randomly changing 1% of the ACTG components     and checks if one of these mutations affects the inserted message.     We have ran 1000 different simulations where this process has been     computed iteratively and in none of these cases the random     mutations affected the message. From this we concluded that for our     specific case the impact of the random mutations influencing our     project was extremely low and that we could have safely saved     Arthur Conan Doyle’s quote.
We have also asked ourselves how many of these quotes we could     have theoretically been able to store safely into the bacteria, in     order to do so we have modified the computational model where we     recursively increased the size of the message at every simulation     according to the following equation:
\[     f(i) = 556 \prod_{i=1}^N i    \]
556 corresponds to the length of the original message which is     recursively increased according to the value of N, the simulations     show that the first 2 random mutations affecting the message occur     when N reaches a value of 6. This corresponds to a 400.320 base     pair long message. This result provides interesting insights to     future research that aims to store always bigger amounts of data     into the DNA of bacteria, more in detail it corresponds to the     maximum amount of base pairs that can be modified in Bacillus     subtilis.
A Python implementation of the model is available at dna_analysis.py .     The script requires Python 2.7 and the random, copy and numpy libraries. Also make sure     to download and place BacillusSubtilis.txt in the same directory.
