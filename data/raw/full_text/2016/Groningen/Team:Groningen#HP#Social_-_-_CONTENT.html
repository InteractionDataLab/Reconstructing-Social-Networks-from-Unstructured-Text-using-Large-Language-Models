The decoy is present in a much higher ratio than the key-spores. The key-spores have to be recovered using a specific selection mechanism. We have developed a ciprofloxacin resistance cassette that can be integrated into the <EM>B. subtilis genome.</EM> Only the knowledge of this specific selection antibiotic will allow the recovery.  To access the key not only general knowledge about molecular biology is required. The recipient has to know specific information about the exact biological procedure that has to be applied in order to access the key.</P><P> We believe that getting in contact with the National Institutions

                we have found out that most of the surveys

		method that they use to send sensitive information. As depicted in 
		Graph 1, 89% of the people send information through digital means 
		(Email, social media and instant messaging apps) Likely because of the 
		speed and accessibility that these communication means provide to the 
		user when compared towards physical sending (Regular Post).</P><P>In addition to that, 50% of the people who answered our survey trust 
		sending their information through regular post and email, while 33% 
		trust only one between the two mentioned methods. 17% of the population 
		does not trust sending information by any of the methods mentioned above.

		Survey respondents <STRONG>use</STRONG> and <STRONG>trust</STRONG> 
		digital and physical means for sending of information. </P><P> However, what would happen if they might need to send highly secure 
		information. Would they trust current and conventional methods such as a 
		letter in regular post or an email? 
		How would their initial conclusion change when the information that has to be 
		sent would change from hardly secret to highly secret?</P><P>The answers to these questions are the first point of interest of the 
		study: What is the current perception in the sending of sensitive 
		information?</P><P>We found out, by asking to our survey respondents if they would send 
		highly-secret information by regular mail or email (Graph 3), that  46% 
		of the population <STRONG>would not trust</STRONG> sending such 
		information through those conventional means (either by post or email) 
		39% commented that it would depend on the destination of the 
		information. Survey respondents commented that the locations where the post 
		service is efficient and reliable, could be considered as an option: 
		however, in places where such systems are not completely efficient, 
		they would not consider it as an option.</P><P>By analyzing deeply each individual responses we found out that 84% of the survey respondents that would not trust to send sensitive information through conventional means belong mostly to Latin American countries (taking only into account the nationality of the survey respondents: Mexico, Brazil, Guatemala and Costa Rica) In contrast, most of the percentage of the people who trust sending such information by both post and email correspond to European Countries. It might be that in Latin American countries the efficiency of the post is low compared with the European service. We truly believe that the improvement of the current post services in Latin American countries will lead to an enhancement of the current postal services, and also will open the market to our system in a near future.</P><BLOCKQUOTE> “89% of the survey respondents send information through 
		digital means, but 46% would not do it if it is highly-secure 
		information” </BLOCKQUOTE><P>But such a low trust is not limited only by the physical means of sending. 
		Actually it is more pronounced when it comes to the digital storing 
		and sending of information. From the total of our survey respondents, 
		76% does not feel that the information on the internet is safe from 
		digital espionage. (Graph 4)</P><DIV class="split"><FIGURE class="centrate left flone"><FIGCAPTION class="centrate"><STRONG> Graph 3.</STRONG> Survey

		use digital means to send information, but 76% consider that such 
		information is not safe from digital espionage”</BLOCKQUOTE><P> Actually, according to our surveys respondents, private companies 
		are the principal target from digital espionage (the aim of the digital 
		espionage is to obtain information) and consequently of the theft of 
		information (theft of information “occurs when attackers steal data 
		with the aim of selling these data for commercial gain, to publish them 
		or to abuse them for activist purposes”) As depicted in Graph 5, for 
		our survey respondents, governments are the next most popular target of 
		digital espionage, and citizens are the less popular sector affected 
		for digital espionage and theft of information.</P><FIGURE class="centrate"><FIGCAPTION class="centrate"><STRONG> Graph 5. </STRONG> Sectors 
			that are affected by digital espionage, according to our survey 
			respondents</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>However, the reality is a little bit different when we compare these 
		results with the data published by the Cyber Security Assessment 
		Netherlands CSAN 2015 from the National Cyber Security Centre from the 
		Ministry of Security and Justice from the Netherlands. For professional 
		criminals, as the source of the threat, “there are clear developments 
		which make the threat expedient” against private organisations and 
		citizens, making these two sectors the principal targets of digital 
		espionage and theft of information, In the case of Governments, either 
		phenomena of threats have been observed or there are sufficient 
		measures to remove the threat. </P><P> Since the aim of the digital espionage is to obtain and steal 
		information from digital sources, we asked our survey respondents how 
		they store their information. Surprisingly we found out that 57% of 
		them store sensitive information either physically or digitally while 
		the remaining 43% do not store it. Survey respondents commented 
		that they do not store them because they are afraid of being hacked. On the other side, 
                the physical storing is not used because of the possibility to be 
		stolen. (Graph 6)</P><DIV class="split"><FIGURE class="left flone centrate"><FIGCAPTION class="centrate"><STRONG> Graph 6. </STRONG> How do 
				you store your information? </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><FIGURE class="centrate right flone"><FIGCAPTION class="centrate"><STRONG> Graph 7. </STRONG> Survey respondents would trust storing information in bacteria</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><P>Now that we know that almost half percent of our survey respondents 
		do not store information because they are afraid of being hacked, we 
		asked them if they would trust storing their sensitive information in 
		bacteria. </P><P>As depicted in Graph 7, 43% of the survey respondents would trust to 
		store information within bacteria, which shows that CryptoGErM could be 
		used by citizens as a storing method. </P><P>However, an outstanding amount of 26% of the survey respondents answered that they did not 
		know what bacteria were. This result motivated us to reach as much people as possible by focusing our 
		Human Practices on the promotion of synthetic biology besides our project 
		itself.</P><P>As a consequence the actions of the educational and outreach sections 
		of CryptoGErM were focused to reduce the amount of people that do not 
		what bacteria are, by promoting the knowledge of synthetic biology, 
		the iGEM competition and of course our project. This has been done through media, conferences, invitation of 
		students to join our lab work and by receiving students from High Schools 
		for a lecture of Bio-ART: Painting with Bacteria!</P><P>Please consult our <A href="/Team:Groningen/HP/Education"> Educational</A> and <A href="/Team:Groningen/HP/Outreach"> Outreach</A> Section to discover our
