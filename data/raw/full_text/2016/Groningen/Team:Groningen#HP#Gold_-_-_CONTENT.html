		Graph 1, 89% of the people send information through digital means 
		(Email, social media and instant messaging apps) Likely because of the

		digital and physical means for sending of information. </P><P> However, what would happen if they might need to send highly secure 
		information. Would they trust current and conventional methods such as a 
		letter in regular post or an email? 
		How would their initial conclusion change when the information that has to be 
		sent would change from hardly secret to highly secret?</P><P>The answers to these questions are the first point of interest of the 
		study: What is the current perception in the sending of sensitive 
		information?</P><P>We found out, by asking to our survey respondents if they would send 
		highly-secret information by regular mail or email (Graph 3), that  46% 
		of the population <STRONG>would not trust</STRONG> sending such 
		information through those conventional means (either by post or email) 
		39% commented that it would depend on the destination of the 
		information. Survey respondents commented that the locations where the post 
		service is efficient and reliable, could be considered as an option: 
		however, in places where such systems are not completely efficient, 
		they would not consider it as an option.</P><P>By analyzing deeply each individual responses we found out that 84% of the survey respondents that would not trust to send sensitive information through conventional means belong mostly to Latin American countries (taking only into account the nationality of the survey respondents: Mexico, Brazil, Guatemala and Costa Rica) In contrast, most of the percentage of the people who trust sending such information by both post and email correspond to European Countries. It might be that in Latin American countries the efficiency of the post is low compared with the European service. We truly believe that the improvement of the current post services in Latin American countries will lead to an enhancement of the current postal services, and also will open the market to our system in a near future.</P><BLOCKQUOTE> “89% of the survey respondents send information through

		are the principal target from digital espionage (the aim of the digital 
		espionage is to obtain information) and consequently of the theft of 
		information (theft of information “occurs when attackers steal data 
		with the aim of selling these data for commercial gain, to publish them 
		or to abuse them for activist purposes”) As depicted in Graph 5, for 
		our survey respondents, governments are the next most popular target of 
		digital espionage, and citizens are the less popular sector affected 
		for digital espionage and theft of information.</P><FIGURE class="centrate"><FIGCAPTION class="centrate"><STRONG> Graph 5. </STRONG> Sectors

		results with the data published by the Cyber Security Assessment 
		Netherlands CSAN 2015 from the National Cyber Security Centre from the 
		Ministry of Security and Justice from the Netherlands. For professional 
		criminals, as the source of the threat, “there are clear developments 
		which make the threat expedient” against private organisations and 
		citizens, making these two sectors the principal targets of digital 
		espionage and theft of information, In the case of Governments, either 
		phenomena of threats have been observed or there are sufficient 
		measures to remove the threat. </P><P> Since the aim of the digital espionage is to obtain and steal 
		information from digital sources, we asked our survey respondents how 
		they store their information. Surprisingly we found out that 57% of 
		them store sensitive information either physically or digitally while 
		the remaining 43% do not store it. Survey respondents commented 
		that they do not store them because they are afraid of being hacked. On the other side, 
                the physical storing is not used because of the possibility to be 
		stolen. (Graph 6)</P><DIV class="split"><FIGURE class="left flone centrate"><FIGCAPTION class="centrate"><STRONG> Graph 6. </STRONG> How do

		bacteria. </P><P>As depicted in Graph 7, 43% of the survey respondents would trust to

It’s delving in”</EM> - <STRONG>Sally Ride</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE><P>In our survey we encountered some worrying results. Namely the 
			fact that 26% of the participants did not know what bacteria are. 
			This is something that alarmed us. It became clear that informing 
			people about synthetic biology was the key for making the world ready 
			for CryptoGErM.</P><P>The best way to do this, was through education. So, in 
			collaboration with ScienceLinX, we organized a day at the 
			betafaculty. On this day 115 high school students came to visit us 
			at the campus to learn about our project and about synthetic 
			biology. We did not only invite students with an affinity for 
			biology, but all kinds of students. We did this because we strongly 
			believe in the cooperation between fields to make projects stronger 
			and to provide a fresh view on problems.</P><P>The students and chaperoning teachers attended a lecture in 
			which they learned the basics of synthetic biology, followed by a 
			lecture about our own project. Herein we stressed the fact that we 
			are a very diverse team and that students with almost every 
			background can contribute to the iGEM competition. The discussions 
			following this lecture did not only prove the interest that the 
			students showed in the project, but were also very helpful to us. 
			These lectures pushed us to explain our project as clearly as 
			possible, while still including enough detail to stay true to the 
			complexity of the project.</P><P>In addition to the theoretical lectures, we gave the students some 
			experience in a real lab. Because we only had one hour in the lab, 
			we decided to do some bio-art. This would teach them how to 
			work with an inoculation loop and agar plate and to give them nice 
			visualisation of lab work with bacteria. Dr Jan Kiel kindly 
			provided us with different coloured micro organisms. Because we 
			worked with different strains that had no antibiotic resistance, we 
			taught the students how to work sterile, by using a flame.</P><P>Besides these general educational activities, we wanted to go a 
			little more in depth with some of the students. Therefore we 
			invited some high school students to do their practical work for 
			their high-school thesis, and learn some basic cloning techniques. 
			Because we only had a few days, we could not go through the entire 
			process of bio-encryption. But they had some interesting sub 
			questions we could answer. A few students were interested in which 
			organism to use. To investigate this we cloned sfGFP in both 
			<EM>Bacillus subtilis</EM> and <EM>Escherichia coli</EM>. We found that <EM>E. coli</EM> was 
			harder to work with, because it does not have natural competence. 
			Both <EM>E. coli</EM> and <EM>B. subtilis</EM> showed fluorescence, which means that 
			the students succeeded in their first cloning!</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>sfGFP in <EM>Bacillus subtilis</EM>&amp; sfGFP in <EM>Escherichia coli</EM></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>In the Netherlands, high school students choose a 
			specialisation when they are half way into their six year program. 
			This can be economical or focused more on technology and health. At 
			the end of their studies they work on an end project for about half 
			a year. Herein they demonstrate the knowledge and skills they 
			acquired over the years. For the more beta oriented students, this 
			includes experimental work.</P><H4>Student Celine about her experience: </H4><P>“I worked a week during the summer for my high school thesis at 
			the RuG. One of my questions in my thesis was which bacteria is 
			better for inserting a plasmid. To research my question I worked 
			with two students of the iGEM Team and cloned a plasmid with GFP in 
			both bacteria. We grew <EM>B. subtilis</EM> overnight and then transformed 
			it with the plasmid. With <EM>E. coli</EM> we first had to make competent 
			cells and after that we did a heat shock transformation.</P><P>My time in Groningen was very interesting. I saw and learned a 
			few new things, where I normally not get in touch with. The 
			students were very nice and answered all of my questions. It was a 
			successful week!”</P><H4>Students Mayra &amp; Robyn:</H4><P>Mayra and Robyn are doing their high school thesis on 
			cryptography in bacteria and they also followed a few days in our 
			lab to experience working with bacteria, especially inserting a 
			part in bacteria. </P><P>“Thanks to the iGEM Team we got further in our research for our 
			high school thesis. We learned a lot in these three days. It was 
			very nice to work in a lab.”</P><H4>Students Marco, Jarko &amp; Daniel </H4><P>Marco, Jarko and Daniel also did their project about 
			cryptography in bacteria. They already discovered that there are 
			several ways in order to leave a message in a bacterium. For 
			example, they have read that you can make a color-coded bacteria, 
			when they come in contact with a substance, such as an antibiotic. 
			By allowing bacteria to change color through a certain substance, 
			you can use the bacteria as a secret ink. They also found that  
			combinations in the DNA itself can give a meaning, such as a letter 
			or number. By then to put this combination in the DNA you get a 
			kind of secret language in the genome, which you can read by 
			mapping the DNA and translate. Marco, Jarko and Daniel came in our 
			lab to discover what it is like to change something in DNA of 
			bacteria. The same as the other students they cloned GFP inside <EM>E. 
			coli</EM> and<EM> B. subtilis.</EM></P><P>“The days were a few learn full days, but also fun. The 
			explanations were clear and we were helped good. In this 
			combination our experiment was a success!” </P><H4>Students Lieke, Anouk &amp; Imke</H4><P>Lieke, Anouk and Imke are currently busy with their high school 
			thesis about GFP in guppies. Since we, as iGEM Team, are not 
			allowed to work with animals, we invited them to clone GFP in 
			bacteria. </P><P>“During our days in the lab of Groningen we learned a lot, we 
			really liked to clone GFP in bacteria and the program was well 
			arranged. The help was good and kindly. We learned a lot of this 
			experience, it also was fun to do.” </P></SECTION></ARTICLE></ARTICLE></DIV><DIV id="page-footer" class="page-footer"><SECTION><H6>Team</H6><UL><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Team">Members</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Supervisors">Supervisors</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Collaborations">Collaborations</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Achievements">Achievements</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Contact">Contact</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Jamboree">Jamboree</A></LI></UL></SECTION><SECTION><H6>Project</H6><UL><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Tour">Tour</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Description">Description</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Design">Design</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Demonstrate">Demonstration</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Summary">Summary</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Applications">Applications</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Results">Results</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/FuturePerspectives">Future Perspectives</A></LI></UL></SECTION><SECTION class="double"><H6>Biology</H6><DIV class="split"><UL class="left flone"><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Experiments">Experiments</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Safety">Safety</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Decoy">Decoy experiment</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/PhotoswitchableAntibiotics">Photoswitchable antibiotics</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/BrickCharacter">BioBrick Characterization</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/KeyDeletion">Key deletion</A></LI></UL><UL class="right flone"><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Proof">Proof of concept</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Labjournal">Lab journal</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/PlasmidConstruction">Plasmid construction</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Protocols">Protocols</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Labjournal/PrimerList">Primer list</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Notebook">Notebook</A></LI></UL></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><H6>Modelling</H6><UL><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Model">Modelling</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/MutationRates">Mutation Rates</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/RandomMutation">Random Mutation</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/AIModel">AI Agent model</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/DecodingFidelity">Decoding Fidelity</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/SpiroModel">Optimal Strain</A></LI></UL></SECTION><SECTION><H6>Computing</H6><UL><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Software">Software</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Encoding">Encoder</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Decoding">Decoder</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/FullCoding">Full Coding</A></LI></UL></SECTION><SECTION class="double"><H6>Human Practices</H6><DIV class="split"><UL class="left flone"><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Human_Practices">Human Practices</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/HP/Outreach">Outreach</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/HP/Social">Social</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/HP/Legal">Legal</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/HP/FutureScenarios">Future Scenarios</A></LI></UL><UL class="right flone"><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/HP/Education">Education</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Integrated_Practices">Integrated Practices</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Engagement">Engagement</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/HP/Gold">Gold</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/HP/Silver">Silver</A></LI></UL></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><H6>Support</H6><UL><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Sponsors">Sponsors</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Attributions">Attributions</A></LI></UL></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
