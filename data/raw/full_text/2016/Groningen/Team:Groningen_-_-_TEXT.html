CryptoGE®M: Encode it, Keep it
The world's silicon supply won't be able to cover the demand      for flash data storage by 2040. However, nature has been encoding      enormous amounts of information in DNA for billions of years.      By introducing a sequence into DNA of bacterial spores, one of      the most durable and resilient forms of life,      "CryptoGE®M" tries to combine storing information and      transferring it in a safe way. The goal is to safely send a key      and an encrypted message in two separate spore systems of Bacillus subtilis. Digital and biological protection layers      will prevent this information from being captured by      unauthorized parties. The message is protected by computational      encryption, while the sensitive key can only be accessed from      the spores with the right growing conditions. For example,      light-switchable antibiotics have to be activated by the      correct frequency of light. If the recipient fails, the      sequence will be destroyed and the message is lost forever.
