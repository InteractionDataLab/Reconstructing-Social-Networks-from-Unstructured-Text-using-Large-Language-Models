Project summary
Protecting data through encryption and storage in bacterial spore DNA.
In 2002, the amount of information stored digitally had eclipsed     information stored in analog format for the first time [1] . Just five years later,     only 6% of the world’s data was still analog [1] . In 2015, an estimated     2,500,000,000,000 megabytes of new data were created every day, and     this number is growing at an increasing rate [1] . It is not surprising that data     breaches orchestrated by hackers are on the rise as well. Financial     and legal records, military and government documents, these are     examples of important information that must be preserved for a long     time, but could cause great damage in the wrong hands. We have     become a civilization dependent on information, and this     information must be stored somewhere. As a result, we are faced     with two problems: where do we store all of our data, and how do we     keep it safe?
Storage of data in DNA has been proposed as early as the 1960’s,     but has only recently become a hot topic [2] . This is in part due to the     ever-growing demand for data storage, as well as advancements in     DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies. Our goal is to create a     system for long-term data storage and data transfer which cannot be     hacked by digital means. Digital methods of encrypting information     and converting it into binary code are well established, and data     storage in DNA has already been demonstrated. Our project combines     these two approaches by first converting information into binary     code, encrypting it, and then storing it safely in DNA. Additional     measures based on molecular biology will prevent unauthorized     access, ensuring the safety of the stored information.
Our system will be useful for the kind of information that     should be stored and transferred in a very secure manner, but does     not have to be accessed quickly (within seconds). It will be     possible to obtain the message in about 24-48 hours, however, this     timeframe is likely to be reduced as new sequencing technologies     are developed. For example, this system could be used to store     patent and prototype information, genealogical records, legal and     financial records, banking account details, login data or even top     secret government documents. Given the stability and compactness of     DNA, our system could also be adapted to serve as a time capsule     for human knowledge.
Advantages of data storage in spore DNA
DNA is a far more stable data storage medium compared to      magnetic and optical media, remaining intact for at least      700,000 years at -4°C [4] . Even in harsh environments, DNA      has a half-life of over 500 years [5] . In contrast, current storage      technology lasts only up to 30 years [6] .
Spores are extremely resistant to aging, radiation, heat,      and chemical damage. A viable spore-forming Bacillus strain was      isolated from 250 million year old salt crystals [7] .
The densest data storage medium commercially available      today can hold up to 10 GB/mm3. DNA has a data      storage density of up to 109 GB/mm3, 8      orders of magnitude higher. [6]
Conservative estimates predict that based on global memory      demand, the amount of silicon (required for flash memory) is      expected to exceed silicon supply by 2040. [8] However, we will never run out of DNA!
DNA storage will soon become a cheaper alternative for data      storage as DNA synthesis and sequencing costs drop. It is      estimated to become a cost-effective method for long-term data      storage within approximately ten years [9] .
Data storage in DNA is more energy efficient (and environmentally friendly) than      currently used digital data storage. In 2015, 416.2 terawatt      hours of electricity were used by data centers worldwide. This      is higher than the annual power consumption of the entire      UK [10] , and is      responsible for approximately 2% of global greenhouse      emissions, rivalling the airline industry [11] .
Data stored in DNA cannot be hacked by digital means.
Data stored in the DNA of bacterial spores is easy to copy, simply by allowing the spores to germinate and grow.
DNA data storage is an apocalypse-proof technology because      DNA will be relevant to future civilizations. As long as      intelligent DNA-based life exists, there will be compelling      reasons to study and manipulate DNA.
Our approach
Security through layers.
We use a layered approach with a combination of digital and     biological security measures to ensure the information can only be     accessed by the intended recipient. The first layer is digital encryption. The information is encrypted with the Advanced     Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, converted into a DNA sequence     and integrated in the genomic DNA of Bacillus subtilis, a safe,     thoroughly categorized organism capable of sporulation. The binary     data obtained after encryption will be encoded into DNA according     to the following logic: since DNA consists of four nucleotides     namely A, C, T, and G, every nucleotide will represent a binary     pair (combination of a 0 and a 1). The A will be represented as 00,     C as 01, T as 10 and G as 11. The decryption key and the encrypted     message are integrated into two different Bacillus strains and are     protected from unauthorized access with additional security     layers.
Once the message and key are encoded in Bacillus DNA, the cells     are cultured in a sporulation-promoting medium. Bacterial spores     are among the most resistant biological entities currently known,     and thus represent an ideal substrate for long-term data storage.     The spores containing the encrypted message and key are     freeze-dried and embedded in separate filter papers (or any other     porous material) for storage and transfer, along with a     spiropyran-ciprofloxacin conjugate [3] . The biological activity of this     photoswitchable antibiotic is very low when the spiropyran     photoswitch is in its stable closed form, but increases     dramatically after irradiation with a specific wavelength of light     (in our case, 365 nm) which brings the photoswitch into a less     stable, open form. When the light source is removed, the compound     slowly reverts back to its biologically inactive state. Irradiation     with other wavelengths also results in deactivation. The strains     carrying the message and key (which possess resistance to the     antibiotic) are mixed with numerous decoy spores when brought onto     the carrier material. The decoy spores are not resistant, and do not contain any encrypted information.
When the intended recipients want to access the stored data,     they place the filter paper with key carrying spores and antibiotic     in a culture medium, and irradiate it with the activating     wavelength of light. This wavelength must be known by the recipient     beforehand. The activated antibiotic kills the decoys but not our     key carrying strain. After culturing, their DNA is sequenced and     the key is found. The key contains information necessary to culture     the message carrying strain, and to decrypt the message. Without     activation, all the spores germinate and grow, including the     decoys. This makes it impossible to find the key by sequencing.     Once the key is obtained, the message carrying strain can be     cultured. Their DNA is then sequenced and the message can be     decrypted.
