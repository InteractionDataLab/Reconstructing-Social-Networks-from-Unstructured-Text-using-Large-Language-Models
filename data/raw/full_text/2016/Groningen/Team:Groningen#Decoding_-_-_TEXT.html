Decoding & Decryption
This page demonstrates the decoding & decryption machine of the   CryptoGErM project. If you have extracted an encrypted message sequence   (created by our Encoding machine)   you can enter it and the appropriate key in the boxes below to get the   original message back.
You can also leave the Key box empty to decode a non-encrypted    sequence (such as a key sequence).
You can also try out the machine by creating a message with the Encoding machine and pasting it    here directly. The inner workings of this machine are explained in the Software article.
