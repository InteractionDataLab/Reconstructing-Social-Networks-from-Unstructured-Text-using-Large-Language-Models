			drawbacks when it comes to transfer of confidential data. Synthesis 
			of DNA carrying the encrypted data is expensive and time-consuming, 
			and is currently the biggest bottleneck in our process (although 
			this is bound to change with advances in  DNA synthesis 
			technology). Furthermore, people do not want to share their secret 
			data with a third party that synthesizes the DNA. Both of these 
			issues can easily be overcome by having the third party only 
			synthesize the key, which is far shorter than the encrypted 
			information. This way, the user sends the secret data via 
			conventional means, and the key inside spores. This method of 
			secure data transfer is faster, cheaper and simpler than encoding 
			all of the data in DNA, but does not benefit from DNA’s incredibly 
			long shelf-life.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H3>Data Archiving</H3><DIV class="split"><DIV class="left fltwo"><P>Data archiving refers to the transfer of data that is not 
			actively used onto a separate storage medium for long-term storage. 
			Such data may be important for future reference (old email 
			messages, scientific data, medical records), or needs to be 
			preserved to comply with regulations (records of legal proceedings, 
			phone records). Data archiving is of vital importance to many 
			organizations, such as IT companies and legal firms, as improper 
			archiving can result in fines and legal sanctions, not to mention 
			expensive and time-consuming data discovery searches. Furthermore, 
			scientific data generated by institutions like CERN must be 
			preserved for years in order to verify future discoveries.</P><P>Although data archiving is often mistaken for making backup 
			copies of data, there is a  notable difference between the two. 
			Data backups are copies of data which allow the recovery of 
			information that has been destroyed or corrupted. Data archives, on 
			the other hand, preserve older data that does not need to be 
			accessed regularly, in order to reduce the use of the primary form 
			of data storage. </P><P>There are several forms of data archives, each with their own 
			benefits and disadvantages. Cloud-based data archiving is becoming 
			more popular as online data transfer speeds increase, while storage 
			media costs drop. Although cloud storage is initially inexpensive, 
			it requires ongoing maintenance and consumes far more energy in the 
			long term than offline data storage. Offline archiving involves 
			writing the data onto removable media such as magnetic tape. 
			Tape-based archives do not consume power during storage, and are 
			therefore a cheaper alternative to cloud storage. </P></DIV></DIV><SECTION><P>Archives contain records that have been generated as a result of 
			administrative, commercial, legal or social activities. There are 
			several types of archives, based on the type of data being 
			preserved, including:</P><UL><LI>Government archives</LI><LI>Corporate archives </LI><LI>College and university archives</LI><LI>Historical archives </LI><LI>Religious archives </LI></UL><P>DNA is an incredibly dense and durable storage medium. When 
			encased in bacterial spores its durability becomes even greater. 
			For these reasons, in addition to safe storage and transfer of 
			data, our device is perfectly suited for data archiving. </P></SECTION><SECTION><H3>Time capsule</H3><P>Collins English Dictionary defines a time capsule as “a 
			container holding articles, documents, etc, representative of the 
			current age, … [meant] for discovery in the future”.  Essentially, 
			it is a historic collection of information and items placed in a 
			durable container and buried underground or interred in the 
			foundation of a new building. </P></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="split"><DIV class="left fltwo"><P>Time capsules are a way to communicate with civilization of the 
			future, particularly with future historians and anthropologists 
			<SUP id="ref-1"><A href="#cite-1">[1]</A></SUP>. For this reason, time capsules are typically assembled with 
			the intention that they will someday be opened. The Crypt of 
			Civilization, constructed a Oglethorpe University in 1936 is 
			considered to be the first modern time capsule, and is scheduled to 
			be opened in the year 8113 <SUP id="ref-2"><A href="#cite-2">[2]</A></SUP>. 6,000 years is quite a while, but 
			the Crypt has been designed to withstand the test of time. However, 
			the same cannot be said for many other time capsules. Several 
			preservation issues must be addressed when constructing a time 
			capsule. Many time capsules are destroyed by groundwater, or simply 
			lost because their location is forgotten. The choice of media used 
			to preserve time capsule information is crucial, if it is meant to 
			be retrieved in the future. Technology advances at a rapid pace, 
			quickly becoming obsolete, while electronic and magnetic storage 
			media suffer from deterioration after just a few decades, 
			illustrating some of the preservation issues that must be taken 
			into account. For instance, while disk drives capable of reading 5 
			1⁄4 inch floppy disks were commonly used before the turn of the 
			21st century, you would be hard pressed to find one today. In this 
			respect, DNA presents and excellent medium for storage of 
			information meant for the distant future; as long as there is 
			intelligent DNA-based life, there will be a reason to study DNA. As 
			such, technologies for manipulating DNA can be expected to exist in 
			the future.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="split"><DIV class="right fltwo"><P>A time capsule holding information encoded in DNA can serve as 
					more than just a message to the future. Given it’s density, 
					durability and low energy requirements, DNA-based time capsules can 
					be used to preserve human knowledge for future civilizations or 
					extraterrestrial visitors, in case of an Extinction Level Event 
					that wipes out our society. The KEO space time capsule, set to 
					launch some time in 2017, is meant to carry a compendium of current 
					human knowledge, and is designed to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere in 
					50,000 years. Although 50 millennia seems like a long time to us, 
					it is a blink of an eye from cosmological and evolutionary 
					perspectives. Information preserved in DNA can potentially last for 
					millions of years <SUP id="ref-3"><A href="#cite-3">[3]</A></SUP>, and therefore may someday be discovered by a 
					completely new humanoid species. The Voyager Golden Records, 
					launched aboard the Voyager space probes in 1977 are another 
					example of time capsules in space. These phonograph records contain 
					115 images and almost 1.5 hours of sounds chosen to portray life on 
					Earth. These records will never be seen by human eyes again, as 
					they are over 2.02×10<SUP>10</SUP> km away, and heading away from Earth at a 
					speed of about 62,100 km per hour. Instead, they are meant for an 
					extraterrestrial audience.  Although expected to last for millions 
					of years, these records represent a proverbial drop in an ocean of 
					human knowledge. A DNA-based archive included in such a time 
					capsule could represent a much more detailed snapshot of our 
					civilization.</P></DIV><DIV class="left flone"><FIGCAPTION>Voyager Golden Record</FIGCAPTION></DIV></DIV><BLOCKQUOTE>“This is a present from a small, distant world, a token

CryptoGErM is not a system that will replace a WhatsApp message or an email. It is meant for highly secure data which does not have to be accessed within a few seconds.
We assume the message will be synthesized by a company. The company IDT, which also supported us during our project, claims the synthesis of a gBlock including shipping takes 5-8 business days depending on the size of the fragment. Costs for gBlock synthesis are starting from ~ 0.17$ per base pair <SUP id="ref-4"><A href="#cite-4">[4]</A></SUP>. Our example message consists of 572 bps and would thus cost ~ 100$. The synthesized gene will include flanking regions for integration into <EM>Bacillus subtilis</EM>. The gBlock will be amplified to a high concentration via PCR, which takes a few hours. And can directly be transformed into <EM>B. subtilis</EM>. The transformation takes one day. After transformation, sporulation will be initiated, this takes about 10 hours <SUP id="ref-5"><A href="#cite-5">[5]</A></SUP>. 
From ordering of the gBlocks until the message or key containing spores are obtained a time span of maximum 10 days is needed. Many sequencing services offer an especially fast deal which would speed up the process by a few days.
The shipping of the GMO samples can be carried out within a day. The receiver of the message will allow the spores to germinate. After a few hours a sufficient DNA concentration will be obtained. The treatment to recover the key will take place during the germination and is a matter of minutes. New high-throughput sequencing methods have an efficiency of ~ 1 Gb/h <SUP id="ref-6"><A href="#cite-6">[6]</A></SUP>. The <EM>Bacillus subtilis</EM> genome consists of approximately 4 million base pairs. Sequencing will thus take less than an hour. Entering the sequence into the website and decoding is only a matter of seconds.
Decrypting the message after receiving it will thus take about 1 day.
From designing and encryption the message by the sender, to decryption by the recipient, a maximum timespan of 12 days will pass. We assume that all steps, except the synthesis, can be carried out in the laboratories of sender and receiver. With improving techniques this will get increasingly faster.
