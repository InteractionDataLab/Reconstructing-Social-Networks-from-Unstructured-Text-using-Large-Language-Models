Science is curiosity. We all have natural curiosity. Science is a process of investigating. It’s posing questions and coming up with a method. It’s delving in”</EM> - <STRONG>Sally Ride</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE><P>In our survey we encountered some worrying results. Namely the 
			fact that 26% of the participants did not know what bacteria are. 
			This is something that alarmed us. It became clear that informing 
			people about synthetic biology was the key for making the world ready 
			for CryptoGErM.</P><P>The best way to do this, was through education. So, in 
			collaboration with ScienceLinX, we organized a day at the 
			betafaculty. On this day 115 high school students came to visit us 
			at the campus to learn about our project and about synthetic 
			biology. We did not only invite students with an affinity for 
			biology, but all kinds of students. We did this because we strongly 
			believe in the cooperation between fields to make projects stronger 
			and to provide a fresh view on problems.</P><P>The students and chaperoning teachers attended a lecture in 
			which they learned the basics of synthetic biology, followed by a 
			lecture about our own project. Herein we stressed the fact that we 
			are a very diverse team and that students with almost every 
			background can contribute to the iGEM competition. The discussions 
			following this lecture did not only prove the interest that the 
			students showed in the project, but were also very helpful to us. 
			These lectures pushed us to explain our project as clearly as 
			possible, while still including enough detail to stay true to the 
			complexity of the project.</P><P>In addition to the theoretical lectures, we gave the students some 
			experience in a real lab. Because we only had one hour in the lab, 
			we decided to do some bio-art. This would teach them how to 
			work with an inoculation loop and agar plate and to give them nice 
			visualisation of lab work with bacteria. Dr Jan Kiel kindly 
			provided us with different coloured micro organisms. Because we 
			worked with different strains that had no antibiotic resistance, we 
			taught the students how to work sterile, by using a flame.</P><P>Besides these general educational activities, we wanted to go a 
			little more in depth with some of the students. Therefore we 
			invited some high school students to do their practical work for 
			their high-school thesis, and learn some basic cloning techniques. 
			Because we only had a few days, we could not go through the entire 
			process of bio-encryption. But they had some interesting sub 
			questions we could answer. A few students were interested in which 
			organism to use. To investigate this we cloned sfGFP in both 
			<EM>Bacillus subtilis</EM> and <EM>Escherichia coli</EM>. We found that <EM>E. coli</EM> was 
			harder to work with, because it does not have natural competence. 
			Both <EM>E. coli</EM> and <EM>B. subtilis</EM> showed fluorescence, which means that 
			the students succeeded in their first cloning!</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>sfGFP in <EM>Bacillus subtilis</EM>&amp; sfGFP in <EM>Escherichia coli</EM></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>In the Netherlands, high school students choose a 
			specialisation when they are half way into their six year program. 
			This can be economical or focused more on technology and health. At 
			the end of their studies they work on an end project for about half 
			a year. Herein they demonstrate the knowledge and skills they 
			acquired over the years. For the more beta oriented students, this 
			includes experimental work.</P><H4>Student Celine about her experience: </H4><P>“I worked a week during the summer for my high school thesis at 
			the RuG. One of my questions in my thesis was which bacteria is 
			better for inserting a plasmid. To research my question I worked 
			with two students of the iGEM Team and cloned a plasmid with GFP in 
			both bacteria. We grew <EM>B. subtilis</EM> overnight and then transformed 
			it with the plasmid. With <EM>E. coli</EM> we first had to make competent 
			cells and after that we did a heat shock transformation.</P><P>My time in Groningen was very interesting. I saw and learned a 
			few new things, where I normally not get in touch with. The 
			students were very nice and answered all of my questions. It was a 
			successful week!”</P><H4>Students Mayra &amp; Robyn:</H4><P>Mayra and Robyn are doing their high school thesis on 
			cryptography in bacteria and they also followed a few days in our 
			lab to experience working with bacteria, especially inserting a 
			part in bacteria. </P><P>“Thanks to the iGEM Team we got further in our research for our 
			high school thesis. We learned a lot in these three days. It was 
			very nice to work in a lab.”</P><H4>Students Marco, Jarko &amp; Daniel </H4><P>Marco, Jarko and Daniel also did their project about 
			cryptography in bacteria. They already discovered that there are 
			several ways in order to leave a message in a bacterium. For 
			example, they have read that you can make a color-coded bacteria, 
			when they come in contact with a substance, such as an antibiotic. 
			By allowing bacteria to change color through a certain substance, 
			you can use the bacteria as a secret ink. They also found that  
			combinations in the DNA itself can give a meaning, such as a letter 
			or number. By then to put this combination in the DNA you get a 
			kind of secret language in the genome, which you can read by 
			mapping the DNA and translate. Marco, Jarko and Daniel came in our 
			lab to discover what it is like to change something in DNA of 
			bacteria. The same as the other students they cloned GFP inside <EM>E. 
			coli</EM> and<EM> B. subtilis.</EM></P><P>“The days were a few learn full days, but also fun. The 
			explanations were clear and we were helped good. In this 
			combination our experiment was a success!” </P><H4>Students Lieke, Anouk &amp; Imke</H4><P>Lieke, Anouk and Imke are currently busy with their high school 
			thesis about GFP in guppies. Since we, as iGEM Team, are not 
			allowed to work with animals, we invited them to clone GFP in 
			bacteria. </P><P>“During our days in the lab of Groningen we learned a lot, we 
			really liked to clone GFP in bacteria and the program was well 
			arranged. The help was good and kindly. We learned a lot of this 
			experience, it also was fun to do.” </P></SECTION></ARTICLE></DIV><DIV id="page-footer" class="page-footer"><SECTION><H6>Team</H6><UL><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Team">Members</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Supervisors">Supervisors</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Collaborations">Collaborations</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Achievements">Achievements</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Contact">Contact</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Jamboree">Jamboree</A></LI></UL></SECTION><SECTION><H6>Project</H6><UL><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Tour">Tour</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Description">Description</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Design">Design</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Demonstrate">Demonstration</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Summary">Summary</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Applications">Applications</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Results">Results</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/FuturePerspectives">Future Perspectives</A></LI></UL></SECTION><SECTION class="double"><H6>Biology</H6><DIV class="split"><UL class="left flone"><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Experiments">Experiments</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Safety">Safety</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Decoy">Decoy experiment</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/PhotoswitchableAntibiotics">Photoswitchable antibiotics</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/BrickCharacter">BioBrick Characterization</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/KeyDeletion">Key deletion</A></LI></UL><UL class="right flone"><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Proof">Proof of concept</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Labjournal">Lab journal</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/PlasmidConstruction">Plasmid construction</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Protocols">Protocols</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Labjournal/PrimerList">Primer list</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Notebook">Notebook</A></LI></UL></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><H6>Modelling</H6><UL><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Model">Modelling</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/MutationRates">Mutation Rates</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/RandomMutation">Random Mutation</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/AIModel">AI Agent model</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/DecodingFidelity">Decoding Fidelity</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/SpiroModel">Optimal Strain</A></LI></UL></SECTION><SECTION><H6>Computing</H6><UL><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Software">Software</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Encoding">Encoder</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Decoding">Decoder</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/FullCoding">Full Coding</A></LI></UL></SECTION><SECTION class="double"><H6>Human Practices</H6><DIV class="split"><UL class="left flone"><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Human_Practices">Human Practices</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/HP/Outreach">Outreach</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/HP/Social">Social</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/HP/Legal">Legal</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/HP/FutureScenarios">Future Scenarios</A></LI></UL><UL class="right flone"><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/HP/Education">Education</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Integrated_Practices">Integrated Practices</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Engagement">Engagement</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/HP/Gold">Gold</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/HP/Silver">Silver</A></LI></UL></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><H6>Support</H6><UL><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Sponsors">Sponsors</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:Groningen/Attributions">Attributions</A></LI></UL></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
