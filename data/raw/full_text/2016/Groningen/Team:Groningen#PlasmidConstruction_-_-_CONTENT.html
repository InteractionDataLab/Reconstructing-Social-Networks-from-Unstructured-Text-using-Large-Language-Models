	subtilis</EM> integration plasmid, which can also be amplified by <EM>E. coli</EM>. 
	Therefore the first step was to clone the message sequence into the pDR111 in <EM>E. coli</EM>. pDR111 is an integration plasmid which can be integrated into the <EM>B. subtilis</EM> genome. 
	By double cross-over it replaces <EM>amyE</EM> gene, which is necessary for production of alpha-amylase 
	(see <A href="http://subtiwiki.uni-goettingen.de/bank/index.php?gene=amyE&amp;action=Go">Subtiwiki.uni-goettingen.de</A>)       with desired insert which is located between amyE front flanking region and amyE back flanking region. See the plasmid map below. We used this plasmid for integration of our message sequence into the <EM>B. subtilis</EM> 168 sub+.

		performed <A href="/Team:Groningen/Protocols#Mini-prep-QIA">(QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit)</A>. Firstly, concentration of the plasmids 
		obtained was measured on Nanodrop. Secondly, plasmids were sent for 
		sequencing and then stored at -20°C.</P><H5>Sequencing:</H5><P>Plasmids RBS+<EM>nucA</EM> in pSB1C3 from colonies 2, 5, and 7 were sent for 
		<A href="/Team:Groningen/Protocols#Sequencing">sequencing</A> with the sequencing primers VF2 and VR. (See 
		<A href="/Team:Groningen/Labjournal/PrimerList">primer list</A>).</P><H5>Conclusion:</H5><P>Sequencing results showed that the <EM>nucA</EM> was cloned in the pSB1C3 
		backbone but the RBS was missing and the suffix was also incorrect. See 
		Figure 4. The <EM>nucA</EM> (BBa_K729004) received from the iGEM headquarters was 
		sent for sequencing as well. It turned out that the part BBa_K729004 
		does have the <EM>nucA</EM> gene but the prefix and suffix are incorrect . See 
		sequencing results in Figure 5 to 7. </P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Figure 4. Sequencing result of the RBS+<EM>nucA</EM> in pSB1C3
