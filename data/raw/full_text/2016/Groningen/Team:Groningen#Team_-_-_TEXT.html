CryptoGErM was made by the following people. Our supervisors can    be found in Supervisors and we were also helped by the people and organisations mentioned    in Attributions .
Eike Mahlandt
I am Eike and I am the chairwoman of      this year’s iGEM team Groningen. My task is to keep the team happy      and make sure there are always cookies around. About me, I am from      the North of Germany and here in Groningen I am doing my Master in      Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. During the last weeks I      discovered that I enjoy running in the mud but I am also an      excellent popcorn cook and I knit my own socks.
Bente Hofstra
Hey there! I am Bente and I am in charge of our educational      work and coordinating public relations. I did my bachelors in      biomedical sciences and obtained my teaching degree during that      time. I am now doing a master in medical and pharmaceutical      drug innovation (MPDI). In my free time I like to chill inside      with a good book, some wine and my cat. To add some physical      activity I like to go skating and play volleyball.
Daniel Devlitsarov
I’m Daniel, lab manager for the iGEM      team of Groningen. My academic background is in biomedical lab      research and molecular biology, although now I am focused primarily      on synthetic biology. I am originally from Estonia, but I moved      around a lot. My main tasks for iGEM are      obtaining lab equipment and materials, helping plan the labwork and ensuring biological      safety. Besides that, I like to be involved in other aspects of      iGEM like proofreading emails and writing assignments,      contacting potential sponsors and helping with the artwork. When I am not in the lab, I’m out      taking photos (mostly landscapes and urban photography) or doing      stuff in my garden. I also like to go on hiking trips when I have      the time.
Sambit Das
I'm Sambit. I come from the city of      Pune in India (right next to Mumbai). My role in the team is mostly      centered around the wet lab. I like spicy food, and enjoy cooking      with friends. I am doing my masters in Behavioral & Cognitive      Neuroscience in Groningen. I am fascinated by the mechanisms      involved in making behavioral decisions, so apart from my mice in      the lab, I also like to observe animals in general.
Luis Suarez
My name is Luis Suarez - yes!!, like      the football player before somebody asks... I was born in Mexico      and I am a chemist. Since I like to plan almost everything, I am in      charge of the travel to Boston and am part of the Human Practices      of the team.
About me? Well, I am a simple Mexican...      Eurovision fan, cinephile (you can find me three or four times per      week at the local cinemas here in Groningen), failed writer and      party boy - BEST MEXICAN DANCER EVER!!!
Oh! I almost forgot      it, like a good Mexican I love Tequila, Fiesta and      Sombreros!
Matthia Sabatelli
I'm Matthia and I'm the Italian member      of the team (half Italian actually since my mother is Belgian).
If you search for me in the lab you won't find me, my role in      the project is in fact playing with numbers and computers. I'm an      Artificial Intelligence master student and I will try to compute      the mathematical models of what the guys will create in the      lab.
I like playing chess, make some noise with my electric      guitars and go out jogging when it rains.
My favorite color      is brown, not because I particularly like it, but since I'm      colorblind it's the color I see the most.
Mareike Schmidt
I am Mareike and I'm the sponsorship      manager of our team. My task is to convince companies and      institutes to support our project. I grew up in the north of      Germany and now I'm a master student in Molecular Biology and      Biotechnology, so during the summer you will mostly find me in the      lab.
If I'm not in the lab I like climbing rocks and cooking      dinner with my friends.
Bára Waclawiková
My name is Bára, I’m the lab manager of CryptoGE®M 2016. My      job is to make sure that everything in the lab is going      smoothly and according to the plan. I’m from Czech republic,      but not from Prague, more east, from Olomouc which is the      second most beautiful city of Czechia. I'm a master student in      Molecular Biology and       Biotechnology.
I really like      movies, sports, reading books and hanging out with friends.
Kathinka Frieswijk
My name is Kathinka and I'm the vice-chair of CryptoGErM (or      SpyGEM for close friends). Except for our logo, I made pretty      much all of the drawn images on the wiki. I'm also in charge of the design of the poster. I have bachelor      degrees in Medicine, Mathematics and Physics and am currently      following masters in Theoretical Physics and Operations      Research.
I absolutely love being outside, so I spend      most of my time studying on the grass in front of the faculty      building. When I'm forced to stay inside, you can always find      me near (or hanging out of) a window. Besides drawing, I like      playing beach volleyball and dancing. In my free time, I try to      trick random birds and forest animals into becoming my pets,      mostly without success.
Ilona Mager
My name is Ilona and I am the Secretary of this year’s iGEM      team. One of my duties as Secretary is to make notes during the      meetings. A little introduction about me: I am from ‘The Far      East of the Netherlands’ called Twente. Currently I am studying      Biology and Medical Research at the University of Applied      Sciences, Enschede.
One of my favorite things to do is watching cute animal      video's on the internet. In addition, I like reading very much.
Carlos Ramírez
My name is Carlos. I have a bachelor in      Pharmaceutical Engineering and I´m currently enrolled in the master      degree in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. I am a lab rat in iGEM.      Also doing some molecular dynamics and computational analysis. As such,      I like molecules and play video-games.
Peter-Jan van het Hof
My name is Peter-Jan and I’m the      treasurer of our team. Besides that, I help obtaining sponsors for      our project. I grew up in a lovely small village in the middle of      Drenthe. I have a bachelor’s degree in Applied Physics and I'm      currently enrolled in the master Applied Physics. In my free time I      love to take my bike out for a spin. I also like a BBQ and hanging      out with friends.
Marco Gunnink
I'm Marco, resident code-monkey. My      major is in Computing Science, hence my tasks in the iGEM team are      data management and the Wiki. I'm also responsible for the software part of our project.      In my spare time I like to play video      games, programming and reading. Sometimes all at the same      time.
