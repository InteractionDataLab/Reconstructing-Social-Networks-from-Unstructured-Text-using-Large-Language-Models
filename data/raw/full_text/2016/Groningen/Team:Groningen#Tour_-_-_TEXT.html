Tour
We want to combine computer science and biology to create a      hackproof encryption system, CryptoGErM. The purpose of CryptoGErM      is to create a system that allows authorized users to access data      like messages, files or passwords, only when they use the right      biological and digital keys. Therefore if someone intercepts our      system he/she is not able to obtain the information because he/she      is lacking the required keys. Without the keys it is impossible to      read the encrypted message. While current encryption methods only      use digital keys, we want to include a biological key as well to      enhance the security. Therefore CryptoGErM is a bio encryption      system. The system consists of the following 6 steps. Think of a      message and we can start!
Encryption
At this moment we have your message in plain text form and      totally unprotected. We are going to encrypt it digitally. First a      short introduction to encryption or cryptography: This term means      the encoding of a message so only an authorized person can read it.      The plain text is being converted to cipher text using an      encryption algorithm. In this state the message cannot be read. The      algorithm requires a key for the encryption process. This key can      be a word just like a password. In theory it is possible to decrypt      the message without the key but a lot of computing power, knowledge      and resources are required so practical it is almost impossible.      With the key the message can be easily decrypted. This makes the      key the sensitive part, which has to reach the receiver without      being intercepted. The key itself is not encrypted.

Conversion
You chose a message you would like to secure and created a      digital key to encrypt it. In order to apply our encryption      algorithm the message as well as the key has to be converted to      binary string. Therefore text is converted to ASCII code, which      gives every letter a number. In the next conversion step these      numbers are converted to binary code. In that state the encryption      algorithm is applied. The message is now cipher text but the      digital key remains unprotected. Therefore it is converted to DNA      code to be integrated into Bacillus subtilis to be protected by the      biological key. We are also converting the encrypted message to DNA      sequence because storing information in DNA has many advantages.      These two DNA sequences can be easily synthesized. Let's synthesize      the DNA and integrate it into the genome of Bacillus subtilis.

Integration
Now you have your message as a DNA sequence . Where      would be a good place to store this sequence? Hmmmm... What about      Bacillus subtilis? This bacterium can take good care of our key and      message. It can naturally take up these DNA sequences to its      genome. On top of that it can form spores and those are super      resistant. They will keep the key and message safe from the      environmental influences.

Transmission
Spores are stable at room temperature and do not need any      nutrients. They are fine to stay in a tube for weeks, therefore      there will enough time for them to travel to any spot on the Earth.      They are also very small and you cannot see them by eye. So who      would suspect you are sending a highly secure message in this empty      seeming tube. But let’s send the sensitive key first and make sure      your receiver got it before you send the valuable message.

Treatment
Your receiver obtained your key spores. It is time for the      receiver to grow the spores and get the final key DNA sequence. For      him, the receiver, it would be really easy, however for someone who      is not familiar with this system, it will not be easy at all. First      the biological lock has to be opened. You and your receiver agreed      on a biological key beforehand. This biological lock comprises the      proper germination conditions for the key spores. A wrong treatment      will cause the loss of the desired DNA sequence and therefore the      message cannot be read anymore. Only with the biological key, the      right treatment of the spores, the DNA of the Bacillus subtilis      culture can be harvested and the genome will be sequenced.      Congratulations! The biological lock has been unlocked! Now just      one final step has to be done to get the DNA key sequence.

Decoding
You are almost there. Your receiver can let you know that he or      she successfully obtained the digital key from the DNA sequence      stored in the Bacillus subtilis spores. Now you can send the      encrypted message either in spores as well or digitally because the      message is secured by encryption. Finally, when your receiver has      everything he needs, he can decrypt the message with the key in our      decryption program. Congratulations, you just used the CryptoGErM      system to send a super secure message.
