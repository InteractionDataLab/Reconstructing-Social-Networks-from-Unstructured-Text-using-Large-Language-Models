Prof. Dr. Oscar P. Kuipers
It's a great pleasure to work with      motivated and talented students interested in Synthetic Biology      during iGEM projects. This way of self-teaching is very effective      in my opinion: learning many different skills in experimentation,      modeling, presenting, organizing, collaborating, fund-raising and      human practices is an excellent experience if the student wants to      continue in science (or any other job as a matter of      fact).
Dr. Elrike Frenzel
I am Elrike and I obtained my PhD summa cum laude in 2011 at the Technical University of      Munich, Department of Microbiology. Since 2014, I am Postdoctoral      Fellow at the Department of Molecular Genetics at the Groningen      Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute. My research is      focused on phenotypic heterogeneity in bacteria, subpopulation      structures and on the optimization of reporter proteins for Bacillus species. In my free time, I enjoy yoga, running      and travelling. It is a pleasure to support our highly motivated      iGEM team. It is fascinating, how quickly students develop creative      concepts, implement the lab work and improve their soft skills in      this interdisciplinary, team-oriented competition.
Jhonatan Hernandez-Valdes, MSc
My name is Jhonatan and I participated      in iGEM 2012 with the CINVESTAV-Mexico team as a student member,      and now while doing my PhD in Groningen, I am happy to be back in      this competition and support the CryptoGErM team! This is a great      opportunity to learn how science works, from planning a project,      until give a presentation of results. Then, it is a pleasure to      help the team and enjoy the IGEM experience with them. Besides my      research interest in biosensors and synthetic biology, I love      chocolate and travelling.
Renske van Raaphorst
This year is fourth iGEM year and my third as a      supervisor. In 2012 I was a member of the team here in      Groningen and we won the big aluminium biobrick that year!      The replica is still standing in the hallway here. Being a      supervisor for this team is great: they are so good, I      hardly have to do anything! And apart from being lazy,      that's also very cool because it means that it is their      project, their creativity, cleverness and drive which makes      CryptoGErM a fantastic project.
