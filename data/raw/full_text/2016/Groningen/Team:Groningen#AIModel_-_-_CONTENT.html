			that aims to model the behaviour of some of the agents that could 
			make use of the CryptoGErM system. The model combines knowledge of 
			different research areas such as Epistemic Logic, Machine Learning 
			and Multi-Agent Systems. Two agents have been modelled, a possible 
			Sender and a relative Criminal. The goal of the first one is to 
			encrypt and send a top-secret message as safely as possible, while 
			the criminal’s goal is to avoid this possible scenario. The agents 
			have been modelled according to the BDI Architecture, a formal 
			model that defines how rational agents act and behave <SUP id="ref-1"><A href="#cite-1">[1]</A></SUP>, which 
			has been modified and expanded specifically for this simulation. 
			The individual parameters of this architecture have been estimated 
			through the use of a genetic algorithm in order to understand which 
			parts of the architecture turn out to be more significant in a 
			possible CryptoGErM scenario.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H3>Introduction</H3><DIV class="split"><DIV class="left flone"><P>Once the CryptoGErM project started, before moving our attention to 
			a broader perspective involving big data storage, we considered our 
			idea as a possible way of sending sensitive information in a very 
			secure way. Thanks to the combination of the Advanced Encryption 
			Standard algorithm and the biological security layers that make it 
			hard to get to the point in which it is possible to sequence the 
			DNA of a bacteria, CryptoGErM originally would have been the newest 
			method to use for sending highly reserved information. Most of the 
			research that has been done in the lab in order to make our system 
			as safe as possible, has been inspired by imagining possible 
			scenarios involving the potential users of CryptoGErM. &quot;What might 
			happen if the agents wouldn’t have enough knowledge to successfully 
			make CryptoGErM work?&quot; or &quot;What could happen if one agent would be in 
			possession of enough sensitive information in order to make the 
			whole procedure fail?&quot; are only two out of the multiple questions 
			that made it clear that in order to create an efficient product, 
			there was need to understand and imagine future scenarios involving 
			the possible users of the system. The two main agents that turned 
			out to be the most significant ones were a potential Sender agent, 
			that has as main goal hiding and sending as safely as possible a 
			top-secret message, and a potential Criminal, who wants to avoid 
			this scenario. Imagining all the possible interactions between 
			these two actors is of course impossible to achieve, however it is 
			possible to simulate part of their behaviours assuming they are 
			rational.
</P></DIV></DIV><P>In order to do so we have been inspired by work <SUP id="ref-1"><A href="#cite-1">[1]</A></SUP> where 
			an Artificial Intelligence architecture based on Epistemic Logic is 
			proposed for modelling rational agents. This gave us the 
			opportunity to simulate different type of Agents and through the 
			use of a genetic algorithm explore the different features that 
			characterize their rationality. By exploring and computing the 
			optimal features we have been able to identify the core points that 
			have to be considered when building CryptoGErM in the most efficient 
			way as possible. The following sections explain how the 
			computational model has been built and trained in order to identify 
			the most important aspects of the A.I. architecture, and how this 
			knowledge has guided the whole lab work.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H3>Architecture of the Model</H3><P>The Agents have been modelled according to the BDI Architecture, 
			an epistemic logic based system proposed in <SUP id="ref-1"><A href="#cite-1">[1]</A></SUP> in 1991. The paper 
			states how important Beliefs, Desires and Intentions are in 
			determining the behaviour of rational agents, more in detail the 
			authors assert how every rational action taken from an agent is 
			basically based on these three components. The combination of these 
			features have an impact on the agent’s future, in fact they have 
			the ability to produce different actions and as a consequence give 
			rise to different future scenarios. These possible scenarios, 
			called Worlds, are modelled according to a temporal structure and 
			are defined as Time Trees, every moment in the time tree is the 
			result of an action based on the three previously mentioned BDI 
			features and is defined as a Situation. One Agent can move between 
			different time situations until it achieves its goal. The three BDI 
			components have a different impact on the agent’s behaviour and are 
			defined as follows:</P><UL><LI>Beliefs: are defined as those worlds that the agent 
				believes to be possible, technically every Belief is considered 
				as a complete and independent Time Tree since there are no 
				restrictions that can avoid an Agent to believe in something. 
				This feature is formalized as follows: ∀ w ∈ W. Where w 
				corresponds to a single time tree and W as the entire set of 
				beliefs.</LI><LI>Desires: are those worlds that correspond to the optimal 
				future scenario an agent wants to achieve, an agent can be 
				happy with multiple outcomes but usually the main Desire is a 
				single one and can be expressed by the following formalism: ∃! 
				w ∈ W.</LI><LI>Intentions: are considered as sets of intention-accessible 
				worlds. These worlds are ones that the agent has committed to 
				attempt to realize. Differently from the Beliefs, where all 
				possible worlds are considered, the Intention feature is 
				characterized by a strong component of realism since the worlds 
				that are part of this feature are only the ones that the Agent 
				thinks can be a possible Desire.</LI></UL><P>In addition to the three BDI features some extra parameters have 
			been added in order to model the agents. The reason this has been 
			done is related to the genetic algorithm that has been used in 
			order to simulate their behaviour and is explained into more detail 
			in the next section. The parameters that have been added to the 
			architecture are different according to the type of agent that has 
			been modelled, however the general idea is the same one for both of 
			them. In order to represent a potential level of Beliefs, Desires 
			and Intentions in a CryptoGErM scenario some extra features related to 
			this architecture have been added that might have an impact on all 
			three BDI components and as a consequence on the Agents’ actions. 
			Regarding a potential Sender the three additional features that 
			have been added are the following:</P><UL><LI>γ: which corresponds to a particular level of riskiness the 
				agent will take into account in his actions. The impact of this 
				feature is different on the three BDI components, in fact a 
				high level of riskiness makes the agent have a smaller set of 
				total Beliefs since there is no reason to think about all those 
				worlds that involve highly safe scenarios. On the other side it 
				is possible that a high level of γ leads to the optimal desired 
				world and as a consequence to a world the agent thinks requires 
				commitment.</LI><LI>ψ: is a variable that is related to the level of efficiency 
				that the agent wants to pursue in its actions. In this case the 
				higher this value is, the higher the value of the three BDI 
				components will be.</LI><LI>α: corresponds to the time resources the agent is willing 
				to invest when creating its BDI features, the impact of this 
				variable is similar to the previous one. The more time that is 
				invested by an agent, the higher the set of Beliefs will be and 
				the overall commitment to the possible worlds towards the 
				optimal scenario.</LI></UL><P>Regarding the Criminal Agent the meaning of ψ and α has been 
			changed. The first value corresponds to the amount of knowledge the 
			agent has about the different Time Trees while the second one is 
			related to the amount of motivation and effort he is willing to put 
			while interfering with the Sender’s plan. </P><P>The idea of the model was to identify which of the three BDI 
			components is considered as more important by a potential Sender 
			agent who wants to hide and send an encrypted message as safely as 
			possible and by a Criminal who wants to avoid this scenario. In 
			order to find this out a genetic algorithm has been used on 
			different randomly generated agents and the level of the three BDI 
			features has been measured once the algorithm converged to the 
			optimal result. </P><P>Genetic algorithms are a very common machine learning technique 
			that is used in different Artificial Intelligence optimization 
			problems <SUP id="ref-2"><A href="#cite-2">[2]</A></SUP><SUP id="ref-3"><A href="#cite-3">[3]</A></SUP><SUP id="ref-4"><A href="#cite-4">[4]</A></SUP>, they are largely inspired by natural evolution 
			and work as follows: a random set of possible solutions is created, 
			each of these solutions goes through a fitness function which 
			measures how close these solutions perform to the optimal result 
			that wants to be achieved. It is important to notice that the 
			individual values that make it possible to converge to the optimal 
			result are not known beforehand, the only information that is known 
			is the final outcome, which can be achieved in multiple ways.</P><P>Once the agents are evaluated by the fitness function a 
			truncation process occurs, similarly as what happens in nature 
			where only the fittest animals survive, also in the simulation the 
			only agents that are allowed to be part and give rise to a new 
			generation are the ones with the higher fitness scores. How new 
			generations are created more into detail is presented in the next 
			subsection.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H4>The Sender</H4><P>An Agent is created as a string of binary bits and is 
			represented as a chromosome, each part of it represents the three 
			BDI features together with the three additional parameters 
			mentioned in the previous section. An example of a randomly 
			generated agent is the following:</P><DIV class="formula">\[
				Chromosome_1 = \underbrace{010010011010}_{Beliefs}\underbrace{011101110101}_{Intentions}\underbrace{010100101010}_{Desires}
			\]</DIV><DIV class="formula">\[
				Beliefs = \underbrace{0100}_{\gamma} \underbrace{1001}_{\psi} \underbrace{1010}_{\alpha} 
			\]</DIV><P>Every binary pair corresponds to a decimal number that if 
			converted properly and summed together establishes the total 
			fitness value of the chromosome. For the sender Agent an optimal 
			value of 60 has been set, this turned out in the following fitness 
			function, where n is the total length of the chromosome and the 
			main aim is to find the optimal set of bits that satisfy it:</P><DIV class="formula">\[
				f(x) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{n} x[i] = 60
			\]</DIV><P>For our Sender simulation the following parameters turned out to 
			be the most suitable ones while considering optimal convergence 
			performance and training time:</P><UL><LI>20 Simulations: a total number of twenty different 
				simulations have been ran in order to check if the results 
				where coherent between each other.</LI><LI>20 Pools of 100 Chromosomes: the simulation starts with 20 
				randomly generated chromosome pools with 100 agents each. This 
				is the first set of agents that is evaluated by the fitness 
				function and according to the fitness scores the breeding 
				process starts.</LI><LI>Truncation Method: is the approach that has been used in 
				order to keep the fittest agents allowed to reproduce 
				themselves, in order to avoid overfitting issues the top 70% of 
				the agents has been kept while the rest 30% has been 
				discarded.</LI><LI>One point single crossover: is the breeding method that has 
				been used. Once two chromosomes are chosen as parents they give 
				birth to two new children by exchanging 3 of their bits. This 
				technique is shown hereafter:
				
				<DIV class="formula">\[
					Parent_1 = \underbrace{\textbf{010}}_{Crossover Bits}{010011010011101110101010100101010}
				\]</DIV><DIV class="formula">\[
					Parent_2 = \underbrace{\textbf{011}}_{Crossover Bits}{010000010011101111001010111101000}
				\]</DIV><DIV class="formula">\[
					Child_1 = \underbrace{010}_{Parent 1 Bits} \underbrace{010000010011101111001010111101000}_{Parent 2 Bits}
				\]</DIV><DIV class="formula">\[
					Child_2 = \underbrace{011}_{Parent 2 Bits}\underbrace{010011010011101110101010100101010}_{Parent 2 Bits}
				\]</DIV></LI><LI>1% mutation rate: some randomness has to be added to the 
				newest generation in order to make the pool more varied and 
				avoid local minima, in our case a 1% mutation rate has been set 
				which means that one bit of one chromosome is randomly changed 
				from 0 to 1 or vice-versa.</LI></UL><P>Figures 1 and 2 show the performance of the genetic algorithm 
			and the analysis of the three different BDI features. These results 
			are explained more into detail in the Results section.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="split"><FIGURE class="left flone"><FIGCAPTION>Figure 1: The graph shows how after 20 generations 
				of breeding the pool of chromosomes representing the Sender

			features have been changed while modelling the Criminal, however 
			this doesn’t have any influence on how the Agent is represented 
			which still corresponds to a string of binary bits. In order to 
			make the computational simulation more varied some changes have 
			been made to the genetic algorithm starting from the fitness 
			function which in this case has as optimal result a value of 65 as 
			shown by the following equation:</P><DIV class="formula">\[
				f(x) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{n} x[i] = 65
			\]</DIV><P>Also in this case while training the Agents 20 different 
			simulations have been ran that started with 20 pools of 100 
			chromosomes each, however the truncation method kept the top 80% of 
			the Agents and not 70% as in the previous case and the breeding 
			technique that has been used was the n double crossover method. It 
			consists in exchanging not only one single set of bits but two of 
			them of 3 bits each as explained hereafter, the mutation rate has 
			been kept to 1%.</P><DIV class="formula">\[
				Parent_1 = \underbrace{\textbf{010}}_{Crossover Bits_1}{010011010011101110101010100101} \underbrace{\textbf{010}}_{Crossover Bits_2}

				meaning of the graph corresponds to the one presented in Figure 
				2 however some significant differences in the histogram lead to 
				the interesting conclusions presented in the next 
				section.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></SECTION><SECTION><H3>Discussion and Conclusion</H3><P>The aim of this section is twofold, on the one side it proves 
			how it is possible to model artificial agents through the use of a 
			genetic algorithm while on the other side it explains the relevance 
			of this multi-agent simulation in the CryptoGErM project and how the 
			relative results have been inspiring for the lab work.</P><P>Considering the first goal, as explained by Figures 1 and 3 it 
			is indeed possible to modify the structure of the Agents in order 
			to satisfy their relative fitness functions through the use of a 
			bio-computing technique. The structure of the string of bits 
			representing the Sender and the Criminal makes it possible to 
			modify the Agents in a relatively short training time by converging 
			to the optimal result already in 20 generations. These results show 
			how this particular machine learning technique can be used for 
			modelling Multi-Agent Systems and are in line with work <SUP id="ref-3"><A href="#cite-3">[3]</A></SUP>. 
			However the most remarkable and useful results have been provided 
			by the final analysis of the different BDI features representing 
			the agents. The histograms show in fact a significant difference 
			that has lead the development of the whole CryptoGErM project. </P><P>Considering Figure 1, the results show how in the case of the 
			Sender model, the Belief feature is the one that the generations of 
			artificial agents discard in order to get to the optimal score. In 
			fact for 15 times as shown by the yellow histogram it is the BDI 
			component with the lowest value, 6. This is remarkable since it 
			shows how not too many resources should be invested in imagining 
			all possible scenarios when sending a secret message, but it is 
			better to have a strong set of Desires that nicely match with the 
			Intention feature and pursue a single one of those. This can nicely 
			be seen in the graph where an optimal value of 13 has been chosen 
			by the agents for the Desire and Intention features for more then 
			20 times. The same is not true for the Criminal model where in 
			order to be successful the generations of agents have to consider 
			as equally important all the three BDI components. This is 
			supported by the histograms that show how Beliefs, Desires and 
			Intentions occur almost equally with a value of 15. </P><P>Considering this simulation and the main goal of CryptoGErM that 
			sees a potential Sender communicating in the safest way as possible 
			a message to a Receiver and a relative Criminal with an opposite 
			goal, we deduced that in order to make life as hard as possible to 
			the Criminal we had to build the system in such a way that a 
			potential criminal has to consider as many Worlds as possible in 
			order to be successful. This lead us to the idea of adding besides 
			the A.E.S. method, when hiding the message into the DNA, a list of 
			biological inspired security layers that have to be considered if 
			the DNA has to be sequenced properly. As shown by the computational 
			simulation, the knowledge of these Worlds has to be known by the 
			Criminal if he wants to be successful since considering the A.I. 
			architecture it corresponds to the Belief feature. </P><P>Finally, it is important to mention that the computational model 
			doesn’t allow the agents to take real actions and maybe compete 
			between each other, however it still provides important insights by 
			considering the features that make one agent as effective as 
			possible by assuming it is rational as defined by the BDI 
			architecture.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H3>References</H3><P>The Model has been built in Python and consists of the following files: <A href="/Template:Groningen/dna_analysis_py?action=raw&amp;ctype=text/python">main.py</A>,
