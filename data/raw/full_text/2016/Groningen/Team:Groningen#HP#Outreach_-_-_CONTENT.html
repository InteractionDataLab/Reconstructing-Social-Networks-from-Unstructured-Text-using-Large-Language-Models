It is key to effectively communicate intricate researches to the general public. Not only when applying for grants, but also to inform the public on ground breaking findings. Good communication is especially important in the field of synthetic biology, because the idea of altering DNA sounds scary to a lot of people. To better communicate CryptoGErM, we tried to make our project accessible by using animations, as you can find in our <A href="/Team:Groningen/Tour">tour</A>. But also by approaching newspapers, radio- and television stations and giving talks at open-access science events.</P></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="split"><DIV class="left fltwo"><H3>Night of Arts and Sciences</H3><P>Every year, the heart of the city of Groningen transforms into a 
					festival celebrating knowledge, creativity and fun. We were invited 
					to help out at the Aa-church. We got to introduce people to a 
					fungus-operated massage chair. The goal was to let people 
					experience that bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms are not as 
					scary as they are sometimes portrayed to be. It did not take long 
					until word spread about the free massage, and soon people were 
					lining up! This gave us a chance to talk to people about our own 
					project and answer any questions they had!</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="split"><DIV class="left fltwo"><H3>Netherlands Biotechnology Conference</H3><P>In April we had the chance to present the first outline of our 
					project at the Netherlands Biotechnology Conference in Wageningen. 
					Enthusiastically, we designed our first poster, t-shirt and 
					business cards. We met some members of current iGEM teams and even 
					had the chance to listen to the presentation of the Delft 2015 team 
					who won last year’s Grand Prize. During this day we made a lot of 
					contacts, tried to find sponsors and got valuable feedback about 
					our ideas. This feedback influenced our project immensely.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="split"><DIV class="left fltwo"><H3>Utrecht Campus Party</H3><P>At the end of May we have been invited to give a presentation 
					about CryptoGErM during the 4th edition of the European Campus 
					Party. We had the chance to explain our idea to people with very 
					different backgrounds and ages which at the end enthusiastically 
					participated in different workshops given by Luis, Marco and 
					Matthia.</P><P>By doing so we have been able to collect lots of feedback from 
					different research domains that helped the growing of the project. 
					Moreover, we also had the opportunity to listen to several other 
					interesting talks that helped us to improve our presentation 
					skills.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="split"><DIV class="left fltwo"><H3>Radio</H3><P>Jan van de Meide invited us to their radio studio to talk about 
					our project. Kathinka and Bente went to the studio for their first 
					live-radio performance. The radio show is aimed at a very general 
					public, so we got the challenging task of explaining the project in 
					an understandable manner. A major hurdle here was that we could not 
					use visual support, so we tried to make sure to be as clear as 
					possible. You can hear the result <A href="http://www.rtvnoord.nl/radio/programma/20051/Op-Noord/aflevering/4845">here</A> 
					(in Dutch).</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="split"><DIV class="left fltwo"><H3>Auction and BBQ</H3><P>In September we organized an auction to raise money for our 
					project. After giving a presentation of the project itself, the 
					auction started. Every iGEM team member offered some service: lab 
					worker for a day, cake baking, babysitting, lawn mowing, a tour 
					through our lab etc. Researchers of the University of Groningen and 
					friends of our iGEM team members were very eagerly bidding for the 
					offers and thereby helping our project. It was huge success and a 
					lot of fun.</P><P>After the auction we had a BBQ together. A local butcher 
					sponsored the meat for it (Thanks to De Groene Weg Slagerij 
					Groningen!). The income of the BBQ also partially funded our 
					project. The evening ended with an exciting tip-stacking 
					competition which peaked in a final between a 2016 iGEMer and an 
					ex-iGEMer.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="split"><DIV class="left fltwo"><H3>UK</H3><P>The university of Groningen publishes its own newspaper, the 
					university paper or UK for short. In order to spread awareness 
					regarding our project and synthetic biology, we approached them to 
					write a piece about us. They were very enthusiastic and curious 
					about our project. To learn more Simone came over to our office to 
					discuss the details of CryptoGErM. She even visited our auction to 
					get a better feeling for the team and witness our presentation. The 
					article can be read <A href="https://www.ukrant.nl/mag-post/bacterie-met-een-boodschap/">here</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="split"><DIV class="left fltwo"><H3>Lifeline</H3><P>Lifeline is a monthly magazine published by study association 
			Idun. This association has members from both the studies Biology

					office phone to be interviewed by a New Scientist reporter. The New 
					Scientist is a UK-based weekly English-language international 
					science magazine. Despite minor problems with the phone we are 
					part of <A href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23130923-100-send-secret-messages-hidden-in-the-dna-of-bacterial-spores/">this article</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV class="split"><DIV class="left fltwo"><H3>NOS</H3><P>Our project did not go unnoticed by the Dutch national news 
					agency! After the university posted our unifocus video, we sparked 
					the interest of NOS op 3, the department that makes videos and 
					takes care of social media. To get a better understanding of our 
					project, we gave a few telephone interviews. This resulted in a 
					really nice piece and animation, to explain our project to the 
					general public. The article is available <A href="http://nos.nl/op3/artikel/2137342-een-bacterie-als-usb-stick-het-kan-in-groningen.html">here</A>

Together with all the Dutch teams we filled one page. Every team explained themselves in one sentence and included a team logo and contact information. (Translation title picture: The Netherlands is fully represented in Boston at the global iGEM competition.)

The Symposium was held at the <CM>Biotoop</CM>, the former Biological Centre. Our audience consisted of postdocs, PhD and MSc students with a Biomolecular or Biotechnology background. This gave us a chance to practice in front of a big audience and to handle critical questions. All in all, this was a valuable learning experience.
