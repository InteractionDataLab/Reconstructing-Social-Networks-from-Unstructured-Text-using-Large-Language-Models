Design
We designed a novel and safe data storage and transmission     system by combining digital and biological safety precautions. The system     consists of the data which is to be transmitted or preserved,     further called: the message, and a key to the message. The key     functions as a password to retrieve the message. Whilst the message     is encrypted and thereby protected by the digital key, the key     itself also needs protection. Therefore we developed a system of     different biological safety layers. Our CryptoGErM system is an     unhackable bioencryption system. Even if cyber criminals would     intercept the system, they would not be able to get their hands on     the message because they lack the key. To access the key not only     general knowledge about molecular biology is required. The     recipient has to know specific information about the exact     biological procedure that has to be applied in order to access the     key.

Applications:
CryptoGErM has three main possibilities of application. Short     messages can be encrypted in the genome of Bacillus subtilis as     described in this chapter. The genome of B. subtilis consists of     approximately 4 million base pairs. Two bits are converted into one     base pair. Thus, 1 MB could be stored in the genome of one     bacterium.
For sending of larger datasets it would be possible to send the     encrypted data via conventional methods like email and only send     the key in spores.
Furthermore it is an option to divide the dataset over the     genome of several bacteria. This would also provide a way of long     term storage of large datasets.

Encryption and Conversion
The message that is to be sent and stored is encrypted     using the Rijndael algorithm. This     means the message is encoded so only an authorized person can read     it. The plain text is being converted to cipher text. In this state     the message cannot be read. The algorithm requires a key for the     encryption process. This key can be a word just like a password. In     theory it is possible to decrypt the message without the key but a     lot of computing power, knowledge and resources are required so     practical it is almost impossible. With the key the message can be     easily decrypted. The key itself is, of course, not encrypted.
At this point of our design we have a key and message. The     message is encrypted and reads out as nonsense.  At first key and     message consist out of plain text, numbers and symbols. Our     encryption and decryption machine then converts those into the     corresponding ASCII code. The number sequence of the ASCII code is     then converted into binary. And the binary code is converted into a     sequence of base pairs. Thus 00 stands for adenine, 01 for     cytosine, 10 for thymidine, and 11 for guanine. The machine also     adds header and footer sequences to the message and key sequences     for the recipient to be able to recover key and message from the     full genome. Figure 1 shows a conversion table of text to the ASCII code, to binary and to DNA.
The work with BioBricks requires some reserved sequences like     the restriction enzyme sequences for EcoRI, PstI, SpeI, XbaI and     ideally also NotI. Additionally our work with the B. subtilis shuttle vector pDR111 required the reserved sequences SalI, HindIII     and BglII. Our encryption and decryption machine can consider those     reserved sequences while converting message and key. It is also     individually adjustable to other required reservations.

Integration:
Our original message and our key have been converted into DNA     sequences. Synthesizing DNA is possible at constantly decreasing     costs [1] .
Data in DNA format has many advantages. The     right choice of organism can deliver even more advantages. We     chose Bacillus subtilis. It is not pathogenic for humans, it is     naturally competent and a well-researched model-organism. On top of     all that it can form highly resistant endospores. Viable spores of B. subtilis could be recovered from a 250 million year old salt     crystal [2] . What else could we wish for as a highly safe storage and transmission system? The sequences of key and message     are being integrated into the genome of two different B. subtilis strains by making use of the BBa_K823023 B. subtilis integration     vector which integrates into the amyE locus. A scheme of the integration process is shown in Figure 3 and the sequences integrated in the plasmid is visible in figure 3. Like this they can be     shipped or stored separately what makes interception of our system     for unauthorized parties even harder.  Genomic integration of both     message and key is safer than plasmid integration because the     relevant sequences are hidden in a full genome. Whole genome     sequencing is more elaborated than sequencing of plasmid,     especially if unauthorized parties don’t know what they are looking     for.

Transmission
Spores are highly stable at room temperature and they don’t     require and nutrients. The can stay in a test tube for weeks. This     grants enough time to send them to any spot on Earth. And who     would suspect highly secret data in a tiny amount of colorless     liquid in a reaction tube? A scheme of sporulation and shipping can seen in Figure 4.

Treatment
After the different spores, containing key and message, have     arrived at the recipient the key has to be recovered. Only with the     key it is possible to decode the message in the genome of the     message-spores. As visible in Figure 5, the spores have to recieve the right treatment during germination, otherwise the key sequence cannot be recovered.

Wrong treatment: spores died & key lost forever
Right treatment: CryptoGErM lives
1. Decoy key hiding
To make it especially hard for unauthorized parties to access     our key, the key-spores will be sent in a mixture of decoy spores.     The decoy is present in a much higher ratio than the key-spores.     The key-spores have to be recovered using a specific selection     mechanism. We have developed a ciprofloxacin resistance cassette     that can be integrated into the B. subtilis genome. Only the     knowledge of this specific selection antibiotic will allow the     recovery. Even better: This resistance cassette also provides     resistance against spirofloxacin which is a conjugate of the     regular antibiotic ciprofloxacin and a spiropyran photoswitch. In     case of using the photoswitchable antibiotic, spirofloxacin (in its     inactivated state) could be already added to the spore mixture. The     recipient simply has to activate it by shining light of the     right wavelength on it.
To design a qnrS1 resistance cassette BioBrick we designed a     gBlock that contains the Bacillus subtilis promoter PatpI, which is     active from a very early stage of germination and includes a     ribosome binding site. The gBlock also contains the original qnrS1 gene sequence from E. coli, the double terminator BBa_B0015 from     iGEM as well as the prefix and suffix for BioBricks. The qnrS1 resistance cassette was integrated into the amyE locus of the B.     subtilis genome using the BBa_K823023 B. subtilis integration     vector. The qnrS1 plasmid and the selection process of the key-containing spores from the decoy can be seen in Figure 6.
Figure 6. The qnrS1 resistance cassette ( BBa_K1930007 ) is integrated into the amyE locus of the B. subtilis genome. Addition of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin will enable selection of the key-containing spores from the decoy.
For testing the efficiency of the selection of the correct key     spores from the decoy a superfolder GFP was integrated into the     genome of the key spores. This can be seen in figure 7. Via microscopy and flow cytometry the     selection efficiency could be observed. The superfolder GFP was     integrated into the B. subtilis genome by using the pDR111 B.     subtilis shuttle vector.

2. NucA key deletion
Even more safety is provided by two key deletion approaches. In     this case, if the recipient doesn’t apply the correct treatment,     the key sequence will be destroyed.
For the design of a nucA key deletion we made use of the     following BioBricks: BBa_R0040 _tetR, BBa_K729004 _nuclease, BBa_B0030 _RBS and BBa_B0015 _terminator. During the cloning process     we expected to obtain the following BioBricks: RBS-nuclease,     tetR-RBS-nuclease and tetR-RBS-nuclease-terminator. The key deletion     is controlled by the constitutively on promoter PtetR. RNA     polymerase binds to the DNA sequence and leads to the expression of     the nuclease. If tetracycline is added, it functions as a     repressor, binds to the promoter and thus leads to the inhibition     of the transcription of the nuclease. If an unauthorized party     tries to grow the key-containing spores in regular growth medium     without the addition of tetracycline, the key deletion will be     active and the DNA will be digested by the nuclease. This process can be seen in figure 8.
Figure 8. If the right repressor is not added a nuclease will cut the genome and thus delete the key sequence.
3. CRISPR key deletion
Another key deletion approach makes use of the CRISPR/Cas9     system. The system can be used as a genome editing tool. The     plasmid pJOE8999 is a shuttle vector with a pUC origin of     replication for E. coli, a kanamycin resistance gene and a     temperature-sensitive replication origin of plasmid pE194ts. This     plasmid carries the Cas9 gene under the transcriptional regulation     of a mannose-inducible promoter PmanP, and a single guide RNA under     a strong constitutive promoter. For application in our project, the     idea was to replace the mannose-inducible promoter with a     tetracycline-repressible promoter PtetR. The pTetR promoter is     constitutively on and is repressed by TetR. The repression can be     inhibited by the addition of tetracycline.  If the key-spores     containing the CRISPR/Cas9 system are being revived by unauthorized     parties who are unaware of the correct treatment procedure, the     targeted area, in this case the key-sequence will be deleted as visible in Figure 9. This     way the message will be safe and secure.
Figure 9. Without the addition of the correct repressor the CRISPR/Cas9 system will delete the key sequence from the genome of B. subtilis.

Decoding
Now that the receiver has received the message and was able to     successfully retrieve the correct key-spores, he can sequence both     of them. Key and message sequence have to be put into the     encryption and decryption machine. The machine is able to detect     the correct part of the full sequence by a header (GACCAAGCCTGC)     and a footer (GCACCCACCGAC) that have been added to the sequence     will converting it into a DNA string. The machine will apply the     key to the message and convert it back from DNA into the data set     that was chosen by the sender.

What if?
Making use of artificial intelligence and computational     modelling we have designed different scenarios taking into account     a possible intruder of our system and also about how the mutation     rate of DNA influences our system.
We have also looked at the future perspectives of our project.     With the great flexibility of the BioBrick system, other methods     for securing the data inside DNA can be added or developed.     Finally, we have thought of ways to access the data in the DNA     faster.
