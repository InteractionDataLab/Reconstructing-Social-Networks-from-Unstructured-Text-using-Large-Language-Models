Mutation rates during the CryptoGErM process
We present an estimate of the number of bases expected to mutate     during the whole process of insertion, sporulation, sending,     treatment, germination and reading, considering the mutation rates     known to Bacillus subtillis.
Figure 1. A mutation can occur in the sequence      during one of the steps that our system requires. In essence:      message insertion, sporulation, physical sending, treatment of      spores and reading.
Reported mutation rates of Bacillus subtilis
A mutation in the genome of Bacillus can occur in a coding or     noncoding DNA sequence. If it occurs in a coding part, it can be an     evolutionary advantage or a disadvantage. When it is a     disadvantage, the bacteria will have less chance of passing its     mutated genes to the next generation. Thus, some reports that     measure the mutation frequency under evolutionary pressure     conditions may underestimate its real value. As our message is a     noncoding sequence, it will not be an evolutionary disadvantage (or     an advantage) if it mutates or gets lost.
Maughan et al. (2006) measured the mutation rates of Bacillus in     an antibiotic-resistance gene under conditions that did not require     such a gene to survive.  They also found that the mutation rate     itself may increase as generations pass by until it reaches a     plateau. Nonetheless, the necessary number of generations to see a     difference in mutation rates is higher than those our methodology     requires. For that reason, the value of \(0.5 \cdot 10^{-8}     \frac{mutations}{bp \cdot generation}\) will serve as a good estimate.
Number of generations
The probability that our message is changed by a random mutation     also depends on the number of generations that have passed since     the insertion until the sequencing. The doubling time of B.     subtilis is estimated to be 120.1 min (Burdet, 1986) but depending     on the growth phase this value may vary. For instance, Maughan     (2006) reports that the number of generations that passed in one     week was 500 (doubling time = 201 min).

Figure 2. Using our system we take approximately 50        generations of cell growth counting from the sequence insertion        to sequencing.
DNA damage by UV radiation
We planned to use a photoswitchable antibiotic as one of our     bio-layers of security. Due to some experimental issues explained     in the respective section, we are not using that approach anymore.     However, we had considered that it might increase the mutation     frequency to a considerable extent.
First, our calculations (shown in the respective section)     indicated that the spores would survive the required UV treatment     required for antibiotic activation (325 nm, 30 min, 28.8     kJ/m2) and experimentally we did find them to survive     it.
In general, spores are 10-50 times more resistant to UV damage     than vegetative cells and spores during the germination phase     undergo a transcient period in which resistance to UV damage is     even higher than that of normal spores. Spores also have a very     interesting way of avoiding UV damage that is advantageous for our     system, having an almost free-error repair system (Lenhart,     2012).
Tanooka (1978) reports that upon irradiation of B. subtilis with     UV (254 nm, 1-100 J/m2) the mutation frequency increases     in a linearly on a log-log scale, being the spores approximately 10     times more resistant than vegetative cells.
Calculation
As the UV treatment is not used anymore, it is not taken into     account in this calculation.
\[     50 generations \cdot 0.5 \cdot 10^{-8} \frac{mutations}{bp \cdot generation} \cdot 4,215,000 \frac{bp}{genome} = 1.05 \frac{mutations}{genome}    \]
Thus, each line of Bacillus will have around one mutation by the     time we want to read the message. This mutation does not have to be     inside our message, and does not have to be the same bp mutated for     each cell line as explained in the next diagram.
Figure 3. Around one mutation will occur somewhere      in the bacterial genome. Such mutation does not have to be      inside our message and it does not need to be the exact same      mutation for every cell line.
