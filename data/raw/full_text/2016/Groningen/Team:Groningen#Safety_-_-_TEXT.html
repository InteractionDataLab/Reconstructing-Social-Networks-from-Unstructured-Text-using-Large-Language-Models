Safety
Risk assessment is essential to the decision-making process for     commercial release of GMOs into the environment. When GMOs end up     in the environment, they can have unintended consequences for it.     Genetically modified micro-organisms are able to reproduce and     establish themselves as permanent populations and there can be     subtle and long-term effects on the biological communities and     ecosystems. Results of DNA modifications can’t be limited to the     replacement of the specific characteristics of its gene. Therefore,     it is important that when these organisms are released into nature,     they don’t harm the environment or form any risk to human health.     Such problems have led to a broader interest in the theme of risk     assessment in the release of GMOs.
Synthetic biology is a new field, which is different from     engineering genetics and working in the lab. We have to assume that     our target consumers are probably not all familiar with biology.     All in all, a cautious approach is needed. We need to assess the     environmental risks of our iGEM project that might arise from the     introduction of recombinant organisms.
Of course we were wearing our labcoats at all times. Also during labdance.
Safety in our lab
In our lab, where we build our secret message into our bacteria,     we work on a Biosafety level 1. All team members are familiar with the     safe microbiological techniques to work safely with microbiology     and GMOs. The according rules apply in in our lab.
All GMO related work can only be performed by those people      that have permission from the Biological Safety Officer (BVF).      Work according to the rules, even if you believe there is no      apparent risk.
During GMO related work all doors and windows have to be      closed. Verify that insects and other pests are not present in      the lab.
Wear a closed laboratory coat. Do not take this lab coat      outside the VMT area unless it is absolutely necessary for the      experiment. In case of a contamination of the lab cat,      sterilize it first, with bleach or by autoclaving, before      washing.
Clean and sterilize spills immediately. Report serious      contamination immediately to the BVF.
It is absolutely prohibited to eat, drink or smoke, or to      have cups, plates, mugs or silverware in the GMO area.
Pipetting by mouth is prohibited. Used pipettes are      collected in a disinfecting solution.
Prevent aerosols. These may be created by -splashing drops;      -pouring of liquids; - discharging pipettes; -opening of moist      plugs; - using inoculating loops that are too hot. Use of      needles only if there is absolutely no alternative.
Glassware and instruments that have been in contact with      GMO's (Genetically Modified Organisms, GGO’s in Dutch) have to      be sterilized or disinfected before being washed, reused or      discarded. Biological waste has to be collected in autoclavable      plastic bags, which are autoclaved before discarding (use      indicator tape to demonstrate that the bag was autoclaved).
Wash hands with soap and water after work and before      leaving the room. Bench surface areas have to be cleaned and      disinfected daily. Keep the area clean and organized.
Record the general nature of the work clearly in a lab journal.
Safety and security in our chassis B. subtilis
If our chassis B. subtilis is released into nature, there should     be no harm to humans or the environment. In our project we work     with the non-pathogenic chassis B. subtilis for which we designed a     kill switch for safety and for security of our message.     Nevertheless, we came up with idea for an application of CRISPR/Cas     9 for our chassis, which can be found here
The design of our safety and security kill-switch.
“We’re moving from reading the genetic code to writing     it” – Craig Venter
Synthetic biology is one of the most developing and emerging     technologies to date. [1] The field of synthetic biology is     continuously developing. As in iGEM, real-world applications are     constantly shifting ideas, more research becomes available. There     is only a pressing concern, especially with the microbial systems.     Genetically modified bacteria may produce undesired consequences if     they are released into the environment
In order to provide an idea of the risks possible of releasing     GMO in the environment, risk should be assessed. In this special     case of our project, we should not only assess the safety risks but     also the security risks
In general, there are two potential hazards considered     generally; successful competition against other natural strains and     horizontal gene transfer from engineered bacteria to natural     strains. [2] Natural strains have less changes compared with GMO’s     considered their fitness. For example, most designed bacteria     contain antibiotic resistance cassettes in their plasmid, which are     used for the cell forcing to keep an insert plasmid. In absence of     selection a plasmid can be discarded by its host. [3] Therefore,     due to horizontal gene transfer, some engineered genes might could     have been taken up by other bacteria, which also could lead to     competition with other strains. Both situations end up creating a     natural imbalance between species.
There are several regulations regarding genetically modified     bacteria. The one that applies to us are the ones about working     safely with GMO’s and the sending of GMO’s . Following these rules should be taken seriously.
Over time, the lack of evolutionary stability of synthetic DNA     might serve as safety itself. A synthetic bacteria could change to     a near wild-type state, thank to pseudo-restoration. [4] But there     is current consensus that multiple safety mechanisms are needed to     ensure that risks are lowered in case of component inactivation. [5]
We designed a kill-switch to prevent against the two potential     hazards. This kill-switch in under a constructive promotor which is     always on, unless suppressed. If the spores are released in nature     they will not germinate, because of tetracycline deficiency. Under     the control of PtetR, the nuclease is translated, which is capable     of digesting extracellular genetic material. This means that     horizontal gene transfer isn’t a possibility.
Looking at the security aspects, both applications in the     kill-switch are also to prevent that  unauthorized parties gain our     spores with the message or key. If the unauthorized receiver tries     to grow the spores without the right compounds, the kill-switch     will be activated and the message or key will be digested by the     NucA. This makes our system should be safe and secure.
Safe by Design: RIVM
The RIVM, The National Institute for Public Health and Environment, challenged us to go beyond the safety forms of iGEM. By inviting iGEM teams from the Netherlands to present an implementation of Safe-by-Design, they wish to improve safety. At the first meeting with the RIVM, we presented our plan for safety in our project, by which we implemented by the Safe-by-Design concept.
On Tuesday 21th of September we had a second gathering entitled  “Safely continue with synthetic biology” with all Dutch iGEM Teams, the RIVM and the Rathenau Institute. Here we presented our project and what our final implementations were of “Safe-by-Design”. The purpose of Safe-by-Design is to make sure that all the safety aspects have been considered during the design stage of your product. This made Safe-by-Design the topic of the day.

The afternoon was initiated by prof. Dr. Erik Lebret,  Risk Assessment researcher at the RIVM and Dr. ir. Melanie Peters, director of the Rathenau Institute. Erik Lebret gave the kick-off by stressing the importance of incorporating risk management from the beginning of the manufacturing process development. Whether Melanie Peters emphasized the responsibilities after fabricating, because safety isn’t only a matter of engineering.
This day we also spoke about the ethics side of safe by design in the application of biotechnology. According to Sabine Roeser, ethics professor at TU Delft, emotions and art are the sources of ethical in Safe-by-Design.
At the end of the day we had workshops about previous iGEM projects and discussed several important safety aspects of these projects. Perhaps we should sometimes consider whether biotechnology solutions are the best solutions.
This day highlighted a lot of safety aspects iGEM, and compelled us to consider safety and security while working on our project.
