Demonstration
We demonstrate our CryptoGErM system by sending our message to     other iGEM teams in the Netherlands.
Note: this is also described in the Collaborations article.
Sending our message in spores to iGEM Wageningen and Eindhoven :
The idea of CryptoGErM is to send information integrated in the     sequence of DNA. Our system is using highly resistant spores in     which the DNA is stored. Spores are then transmitted to the     receiver who can get the DNA from them and therefore the stored     information as well.  We wanted to prove that this form of     information transmission works. Therefore we decided to cooperate     with two other iGEM teams from the Netherlands and send our     CryptoGErM spores with a secret message to Wageningen and Eindhoven . Read the accompanying letter here .     Follow this link to see how we constructed the message B. subtilis strain.

We went through all the 6 steps of our project. The message was     encrypted with our program and converted to a DNA sequence. This     sequence was synthesized by IDT. When this synthesized DNA sequence     was obtained, we integrated the message sequence into the genome of Bacillus subtilis. Subsequently we sporulated B. subtilis and     spores were obtained. These spores together with primers were sent     to Wageningen and Eindhoven via mail under GMO conditions. Spores     and primers were in the mail from the 6th September till the 9th.     In this case we sent primers for PCR amplification of the message     because we assumed the other teams did not include a whole genome     sequencing in their finance plan. We sent this CryptoGErM protocol     along with the message to the mentioned  teams. The short version     is, they germinate the spores on spectinomycin LB agar plates and     from those colonies the message can be acquired via colony PCR.     Primers for the PCR are provided (primer sequences can be found here ). This PCR product is sent for     sequencing. The received sequence can be copy pasted to our     decoding program. Now they only need to know the digital key that     we used to encrypt the message. We were kind enough to tell them     the digital key beforehand.
Figure 2. (A) Members from iGEM team Eindhoven 2016      decrypting our message sent in spores. (B) Also the iGEM team Wageningen is happy to decrypt our message. Blue arrow indicates decrypted message.
It works! The iGEM team Eindhoven and Wageningen could read our     message which was: “The world is full of obvious things which     nobody by any chance ever observes.” The digital key to decrypt     this message was: ”Autoclave after reading!” We hope the teams did     this with our message after the decoding.
