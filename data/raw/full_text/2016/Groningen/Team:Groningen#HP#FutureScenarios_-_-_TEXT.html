Future scenarios
“Planning is bringing the future into the present so that    you can do something about it” - Alan Lakein
What would be the potential applications of CryptoGErM in the near    and far future?
In this part of Human Practices, we explore the future scenarios of    the introduction of the CryptoGErM system to the world.
With all these fictional scenarios we give a deep insight on the    repercussions, applications and consequences that CryptoGErM would have    if introduced as a daily life system.
The scenarios are presented as fictional digital news and articles    from a futuristic and unreal city called New    Groningen in The Netherlands in the near and far    future, where the CryptoGErM system has been introduced,    followed by an explanation of the current reasons behind its    conceptualization.
We present them as digital news in a mobile device, based on the    prediction that the UN Intellectual property agency’s chief made in an    interview to La Tribune de Geneve, stating that newspapers will be    replaced by digital versions by 2040.
"In a few years, there will no longer be printed    newspapers as we know it today” “It’s an evolution. There’s no good or    bad about it. There are studies showing that they will disappear by    2040” - Francis Curry
The last existing Public Library has disappeared!
First fictional scenario
What if in the far future we start to run out of space to    accommodate the growing world population? Would we be able to find    suitable places to inhabit without damaging natural areas? What if we    use existent spaces to accommodate the growing population without the    necessity of building new human settlements protecting the green areas?    Have we thought about it?
According to the UN DESA report; “World Population Prospects: The      2015 Revision”, by 2050 the world population is expected to reach to      9.7 billion; the available living space could not be sustainable to      accommodate the rapidly-growing amount of people. Such raising in the      population, probably, will see humanity looking for more      space to make sustainable the living of new generations, without using      the green areas.
Within this fictional scenario, CryptoGErM could offer a potential      solution.
CryptoGErM is a system for the storing and safe-sending of      information. By making use of the first purpose, we could store the      whole current information contained in books, newspapers, articles and      other physical paper-based within bacteria to reduce the      space needed for the storing of such information. Bacteria, such Bacillus subtilis is able to store up to 1.5 GB of      information; furthermore, 1 mm3 of DNA can store up to      109 GB of information. [1]
Just to put an example of this fictional application; it is      estimated that the the information contained by the U.S. Library of      Congress is equivalent to 200 TB, currently it is stored in a physical      space of 186,000 square meter. If this information is stored into DNA,      it would only occupy 0.0002 mm3.
Furthermore, storing int DNA is more eco-friendly, because it does      not require any specific medium to keep it functional, in contrast with      current magnetic and optical storage medium that requires energetic      supply to continue working. Just in 2015, 416.2 terawatt hours of      electricity were used by world’s data centres. This consumption was      “significantly higher than the UK’s total consumption of about 300      terawatt hours.” [2]
Storing information in the DNA of bacteria, will replace the current storing medium (Fictional scenario)

Second fictional scenario
This fictional scenario was created as an extreme case by using the    long-term stability of Bacillus subtilis spores.
One of the advantages of our system is that the spores can survive    for several years even if they are exposed to hard conditions. So far,    studies have shown that spores exhibit incredible longevity in a broad    range of environments on our planet. Actually, there are reports from    research groups that have recovered and revived spores from samples as    old as 105 years. This data shows the capability of our    system to store information for hundreds or thousands of years, even in    a hard-conditions environment.
This application seems promising in a near future, as we found out    after the interview we had at the Groninger Archives; Jan Jaap Hoogstins,    collection manager from the Groninger Archieven, explained us that now    most of the documents are being changed from analogous data storage to    digital data storage, and one of two most important things that a    storage system must fulfil is the durability, which means that the information    stored must be conserved for a long period of time.
Spores of Bacillus subtilis are a reliable    option since they have shown its long-term resistance.    Actually, in 2000, a spore-forming Bacillus strain was    isolated from a 250 million years old salt crystals. Moreover, DNA itself is a    more stable data storage medium when compared to magnetic and optical    medial, because it can remain intact for at least 700 000 years at    -4˚C. [3] Even in harsh    environments, DNA has a half-life of over 500 years. [4] Contrastly, current magnetic storers of    information have lasts at most 30 years. [5]
However, is the DNA that contains the encrypted information in bacteria able to mutate through this period of time?
A complete discussion about mutation in Bacillus subtilis spores can be found in the Modelling Section .
A complete movie has been successfully stored in DNA
Third fictional scenario
This fictional and extreme scenario provides an example of the    future applications of CryptoGErM based on the current files and    archives that have been stored successfully in DNA.
Currently, big companies such as Microsoft® have shown interest in the    storage of information in DNA. This gives us an idea that DNA storing    has started to become one of the most promising methods to store    information in the upcoming years. This is mainly given by the capacity of    storage that DNA posses; Church, Gao and Kosuri showed that 0.5    exabytes of information can be stored per gram of single-stranded    DNA. [6]
A big breakthrough happened in April 2016, when Microsoft published an extensive    paper in a joint project with the University of Washington [7] in which they explore the    potential application for the use of DNA as storage medium.    According to this work, DNA storage has a higher    durability in comparison with current systems. Within the applications    of storing information in DNA, this group stored in a DNA sequence and    recovered succesfully three images that originally were in JPEG format.    This shows that nowadays, it is not only possible to store text and    information as we did in CryptoGErM; but DNA can be taken to another level    of storage.
If now it is possible to store images in DNA, in the near future we    might be able to store complete movies on DNA
DNA sequence drops to $0.0002 per Megabase
Fourth fictional scenario
CryptoGErM is designed primordially for information that requires to    be stored for a longer period of time and whose accessibility is not required immediately. However, we are pretty sure that    this would change in the upcoming years due to the fact that DNA    sequencing is becoming faster and cheaper every year. The inclusion of    new and modern techniques, like massively parallel DNA sequencing, [8] have resulted in the    decrease of the price and time needed for the DNA sequencing    parallely to the increasing of the number of megabases that can be    read.
Since 2008, [9] it has    been predicted that DNA sequencing techniques would evolve till the    point that we will be able to obtain the DNA sequence in just a few    hours or minutes, even though many technical challenges have to be    overcome first.
The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), a division of    the National Institutes of Health (NIH), established to take part on    behalf of the NIH within the International Human Genome Project (HGP),    has been tracked the costs associated with the DNA sequencing (These    tack is done within the Centers founded by the National Institute). This    data can be consulted freely on the webpage of the NHGRI, in the    section “DNA Sequencing Costs: Data. [10] The following graph contains the data of    the costs of DNA Sequencing up to October 2015.
Cost per Megabase of DNA Sequence
The graph above shows how the cost for the sequencing of DNA has    plummeted since the beginning of the 21st century; this is mainly given by    the introduction of high-throughput techniques.    By October 2015, according to the data provided by    the National Human Genome Research Institute, the cost for    Megabase base of DNA sequencing was $0.0145. By this year    2016, the cost of the DNA sequencing is expecting to be further    reduced. However, until now, not official data has been released.
According to Moore’s Law, that states that the number of    transistors in a dense integrated circuit and its computational power    doubles approximately every two years, the cost per Megabase at 2015    was expected to be around $50; however, the computational equipment    associated with the DNA sequencing has growing exponentially decreasing    even further the price, besides the new techniques that allows a faster    and more precise analysis.
With all this information, our hypothetical scenario seems to be    possible in just a couple of years, in which novel upcoming techniques    are available on the market.
However, CryptoGErM is not only a system for the storing    of information, our system goes beyond that; rather than just storing    encrypted information, our system can be used for physical sending.
And if the system is in the wrong hands?
What would happen if the system would end up in the hands of a criminal? Which impact would it have?
To give an answer to this question, we propose a computational    simulation to model the behaviors of some of the agents that could use    the CryptoGErM system, within these agents, a potential criminal was    included. Please consult the AI Agent Model in The Modelling Section for further information and discussion
