Riddle
Hi iGEMer! Welcome to our puzzle, here we’d like to invite you     to try our project yourself. We have encrypted a message, and you     can decrypt it, if you find the right key.
Go to the CryptoGErM poster and scan the QR code, you will now     have the message DNA sequence.
Find team members from Groningen and scan their shirts, they     will provide you with hints to solve what the key is.
Get your phone ready to scan QR codes
Get the message DNA sequence at the CryptoGErM poster
Find team members and solve the riddles to find the key
Decrypt the message using our Decoder
Enjoy
