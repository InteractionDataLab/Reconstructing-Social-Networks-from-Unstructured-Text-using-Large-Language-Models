Parts
This page shows an overview about the BioBricks we obtained over     the summer. To find more information about how we constructed the     parts, see Plasmid     construction . If you are interested in the experiments we     performed with our BioBricks check our Experiments page. Otherwise click     on the BioBrick numbers to see our parts in the registry.Since     CryptoGErM is a bio encryption system we created an encrypted     message ( BBa_K1930001 ), which can be decrypted with the associated     key ( BBa_K1930000 ). To protect the sensitive key we developed     biological safety layers. One is hiding the key, which involves     decoy spores. To distinguish between our CryptoGErM spores     containing the key and the decoy, we constructed the sfGFP(Sp)     BioBrick ( BBa_K1930006 ) optimized for B. subtilis. To allow the user     of CryptoGErM to select the key spores, we constructed a     ciprofloxacin resistance cassette ( BBa_K1930004 ). This cassette     contains a constitutive promoter for B. subtilis 168 ( BBa_K1930005 ),     novel to the registry.
