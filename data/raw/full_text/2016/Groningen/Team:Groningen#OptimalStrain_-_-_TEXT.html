Choosing optimal strain for photoswitchable antibiotic
As can be read in the photoswitchable    antibiotics section, the idea with the photoswitchable antibiotic    was that it would kill the decoy B. subtilis but would not cause any    harm to the engineered strain containing the DNA sequence.

When not treated properly with the right wavelength of UV radiation    (see figure 1), spirofloxacin remains in its inactive state. Because    the sample sent to the receiver contains hundreds to thousands of times    more decoy spores, it cannot be sequenced directly by the recipient    (see also Decoding    Fidelity ). Instead, the receiver must activate the antibiotic. Once    done, the spirofloxacin-resistant message-containing bacteria would    outnumber the decoys.
We explored the activity of spirofloxacin on different strains of E. coli, since it was a species of bacteria whose    susceptibility to spirofloxacin had been previously well measured [7] (see figure 2).
At this point of the lab work, experiments trying to measure the MIC    of spirofloxacin “on”/”off” against B. subtilis had been inconsistent.    We thought of Molecular Dynamics (MD) studies as a good alternative to    measure how well the antibiotic performs on Bacillus, thus allowing us    to continue faster with the engineering of the resistant strain.
It is important for our system that the ratio of resistance to    susceptibility in engineered and wild type is optimal. That means that    in its inactive state, spirofloxacin must not have a high bactericidal    activity and when activated, it must be potent enough to kill the    wild-type cells while the engineered strain will survive.
First, we needed to find a suitable crystallographic structure of a    type-II topoisomerase (a protein-DNA complex) bound to a    fluoroquinolone. Topoisomerase IV is the main fluoroquinolone’s target    in Gram-positive bacteria, while gyrase (the other type of    topoisomerase II) is the main target in Gram-negatives [1] . The    crystallographic structure recently reported by Veselkov et. al. (2016)    offered a good alternative as it has the two fluoroquinolone molecules    bound to the protein-DNA complex.
Secondly, we needed to create and adapt an appropriate force-field    that would reproduce the behavior of the binding process at a    reasonable computational cost. A force-field is a set of parameters    that tells the software (we used GROMACS v5.0.4) how each atom behaves    and interacts with others. As reported elsewhere [1] [2] the binding    process involves cation- and hydrogen-bonding interactions that can    only be reproduced in the atomistic level. However, the computational    cost of simulating a 150 kDa protein (embedded in a solvated box) is    high enough to consider using lower-resolution scales. In addition, the    crystallographic structure already is a bound topoisomerase –    antibiotic complex, so there is no need for that high level of    resolution. Coarse-grained models are refined enough to offer insights    into the affinity of protein-ligand interactions (see i.e. [4] ). Some    of the molecular parameters for the spiropyran part of the molecule    (the part that gives it is photoswitchable behavior) had been studied    elsewhere [9] ; nevertheless, its parameterization into atomistic and    further coarse-grained requires some extra work.
Figure 3: DNA in complex with topoisomerase IV and the     molecule levofloxacin (a member of the cipro- and spirofloxacin     family). The GROMOS 53a6 atomistic force-field is used, while for     the coarse-grained the MARTINI force-field (v2.2) developed by the     University of Groningen was used (not all beads shown). Origin PDB     code: 3RAE.
While the MARTINI force-field has been adapted and optimized for    both proteins and DNA [3] [6] it cannot reproduce cation- and    hydrogen-mediated binding of ligands. So our best method is to use    umbrella sampling in which basically the protein and the ligand are    artificially placed in its “correct” orientation and dragged away from    each other, measuring the Potential of Mean Force (PMF) [5] .
Before actually starting the umbrella simulations and due to the    lack of consistent experimental results, we decided to change the    photoswitchable antibiotic approach in our project. However, for the    sake of clarity in the next figure we show what we expected to obtain    from the simulations.
Figure 4. In the umbrella sampling method the     antibiotic is pulled away from the protein-DNA complex as marked by     the arrow. As a result, we expected to obtain a profile as shown in     the right side in which the spirofloxacin shows two binding     affinity’s profiles. (Molecule shown, PDB code: 3RAE)
