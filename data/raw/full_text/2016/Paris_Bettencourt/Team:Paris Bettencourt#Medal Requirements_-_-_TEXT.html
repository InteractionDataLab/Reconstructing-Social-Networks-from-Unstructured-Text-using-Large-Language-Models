Medal Requirements
Bronze Medal
We registered our team, and had a great summer! :)
We have met all deliverables
The attributions of every team member are available here
We have created, submitted and documented a dozen BioBricks. One of them is BBa_K2043002 which represents our contribution for the bronze medal.
Silver Medal
BBa_K2043004 is a xylE gene from Pseudomonas putida codon optimized for expression in E. coli; a new and well documented standard biological part. Our contribution for the silver medal requirements.
Paris Bettencourt iGEM team has made many many friends over the summer. Our colaborations are listed here .
Our project tackled a serious issue of perchlorethylene (PERC) poisoning in the dry-cleaning facilities. On this link you can read more about this problem: how we identified, investigated and addressed it.
Gold Medal
On this
link we present how the PERC poisoning problem was integrated into our project. How we designed and addressed the issue through our project.
We have also improved the characterization of two previously existing BioBricks (BBa_K1321357 and BBa_K863001). For the gold medal requirements we are providing the description of the improvements made for BBa_K1321357 , a BioBrick designed by iGEM team of Imperial College London in 2014.
The proof of concept shows that our project can be implemented
