Figure 1 European Experience. We participated in the European Experience, a big gathering for European iGEM teams organized by iGEM Evry and iGEM IONIS. Every team started in the morning by presenting its project, we all had posters and were exchanging with other iGEMers. It was a good opportunity to explain our project Frank&Stain for the first time : we presented our main idea, our workflow, our goals, etc. By exchanging with other iGEMers on our project they gave us feedback and ideas. European Experience was also a great way to meet European teams and learn what kind of projects and ideas they have in mind. Potential collaborations arose,  we asked for red wine from teams near vineyards. Last but not least we had to very interesting conferences on Synthetic Biology in the afternoon.
Figure 2 NightScience. Biodesign Nightscience is an event organized by the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research-Paris. This event gathers each year researchers, hackers and education innovators to share their approaches and experience on building new ways to achieve better knowledge construction and transmission. Our team was invited to present our project in front of diverse audience. We had 15 minutes to present our idea and work, followed by 10 minutes of questions. We were very glad to hear the views of audience coming from different backgrounds on our synthetic biology approach to tackle wine stains and supplant PERC in dry cleaning. We met iGEM-University of Cambridge and exchanged our views on each other's project and presentation. We met some of the fantastic people and learnt more on DIY, open, frugal, hands-on, collaborative and citizen science! We thank the organizers of the Biodesign Nightscience for giving us the opportunity to present the project and convey synthetic biology approach to more diverse audience.
Figure 3 Meet-up Ile-de-France. On this day teams from Paris had a meeting, organized by Paris Pasteur team, at the Institut Pasteur, and everyone had to do a twenty minutes presentation of its project. It was a very good way to practice for the Jamboree and present a more defined project and first results. iGEM Pasteur, IGEM IONIS, iGEM Savlay, iGEM Evry and iGEM UPMC and us were present. We were the first team to present, at 9:30 in the morning, and ended with an interesting session of questions and answers, the public raised very good questions for us to think about, for our presentation and our project's progress. A jury evaluated presentations and gave us good advice on our to present better and told us what part of our project to better linked with the rest. It was an interesting first test at presenting and sharing results, the only drawbacks being hat at this stage of the project we did not have that much to present.
Teams had lunch together and enjoyed a drone demonstration, a very agreable addition to the Meet-up! We realy enjoyed ourselves this day and enjoyed exchanging with Paris team and learning about each other's project and progress.
Figure 4 Festival du Vivant. The Festival vivant is a event organised to learn about synthetic biology and have an informed debate on the future we wish to build with this technology. This event gathered start ups, iGEM teams, designers and artists who presented their projects and their vision of the future synbio can inspire.  During this event we had a stand in the Village des Initiatives, Initiatives village, in which we presented our project and answered questions on iGEM and synthetic biology. We also pitch our project during a conference held for this event in an amphitheater.
Eventually on the last day, we co-animated a workshop on the future we can imagine with synthetic biology with Frédéric Tournier, Professor at the Université Paris Diderot, and Philippe Deterre, biologist at CNRS. This workshop was attended by 20 people with different backgrounds and of different ages
