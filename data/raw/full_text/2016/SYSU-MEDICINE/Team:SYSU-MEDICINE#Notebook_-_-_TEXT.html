Since it is the first time for our school to participate in the iGEM competition ……
Having basic knowledge of iGEM, six kindred spirits gathered together and decided to participate in this competition. After deliberation, we started to prepare our team.
Our team, named as SYSU-MEDICINE, was successfully built, comprising four groups for lab work, modeling, art design and human practice respectively.
Assigned the tasks for winter vacation, including exploring feasible project theme, learned basic methods of literature search and summarized previous iGEM projects of the latest three years.
Six internal meetings were held and had a meet up with SYSU-China, from which we learned the importance of having a round knowledge of the rules of iGEM competition.
Started raising fund and lab resources.
Got in touch with leadership of Zhongshan School of Medicine and several professors and finally gained official support of Zhongshan School of Medicine. Refined our project at the suggestion of professors.
Final determination of supporting lab and fund resource.
Determined our first PI, second PI and instructor, to whom we presented our primary project and had a further discussion.
Signed up for iGEM.
Internal meetings for routine progress report were held, in which we decided the main topic of our project: mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). After related article readings and with the guidance of our instructor, we further enriched our project and detailed our experiment plans. On May 20th, our final design was born.

1. Carefully shaved a 1cm×1cm filed on the back between the shoulders of the mouse using an electric razor.
2. While holding the mouse with one hand, smeared the shaved backs with presensitization solution (150μL/20g), which is the mixture of acetone, olive oil and TNBS in 16:4:5 scale.
3. Control mice are treated with presensitization solution without TNBS.
4. All the mice were in good condition.
DTH
1. Carefully shaved a 1cm×1cm filed on the back between the shoulders of the mouse using an electric razor.
2. While holding the mouse with one hand, smeared shaved backs with 150μL 0.5% DNFB solution in acetone/olive oil (4:1).
3. Control mice are treated with identical amount of acetone/olive oil (4:1).
4. All the mice were in good condition.
IBD
Absolute diet is applied to the mice apart from the water.
Anesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of 4% chloral hydrate (150μL/20g).
Insert the catheter into the colon 4cm proximal to the anus and slowly administer 150μL/20g TNBS/alcohol solution into the colon. Keep the mice with hand down for 60s before returning to the cage.
Concerning the damaged colon, we replace normal mice food with jelly to lessen the pain ensuing from sensitization.
In the evening, 3 mice are found dead, 2 mice are weak and have less activity, while the others are in good condition.

Weak mice are dead finally.
We weight the mice left. The weight change indicates that 18 of them are modeled successfully. So, we inject 200 μL MSCs in dose of 1*106 into 9 mice from caudal vein.

Challenge right ears with 20μL 0.3% DNFB solution. Two hours after sensitization, inject 200 μL MSCs in dose of 1*106 to 16 mice and PBS of identical amount to another 8 mice of control groups from caudal veins respectively.
IBD
All the animals are sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Then we take the colon tissue and measured the length .The colon tissue are kept in PFA or Trizol in EP tube for HE staining or q-PCR. The colon length, DAI score and the concentration of the cytokines will be performed using SPSS.

Concerning the damaged colon, we take the jelly for the mice to lessen the pain after modelling.
On Day 11, dissolve 5 μg of recombinational EGF in 25 ml saline. Insert 150ug/20g EGF solution into the colon for 6 mice. Sacrifice the narcotic mice with EGF on Day 13.Take the large intestine tissue and measured the length. Keep the large intestine in PFA or Trizol in EP tube for qPCR or HE staining. The colon length, DAI score and the concentration of the cytokines will be performed using SPSS.
The mice left were injected 200 μL MSCs in dose of 1*106 into from caudal vein.

After that, the mouse are sacrificed and colons are taken and measured for their length. The colons are kept in PFA or Trizol in EP tube for qPCR or HE staining.
Submission
Using the DNA carrier provided by iGEM, and the DNA to submit, digest and ligate them. But we failed. After analyzing, the reasons we suspect are as followed:
1.The concentration of the DNA is too low to make it,
2.The carrier provided by iGEM is useless because the linear carrier has low working efficiency.
As a result, we are going to have some meetings to solve it.
3.Using the part distribution to get the carrier annular carrier by Enzyme digestion, and put the first group of gene into the carrier by ligament.
Successful!
As a result, we finish the first group of submission, including two genes: CCR7 and CXCR4.
1.We started working the second group, including CXCR1, CCR5, Luciferease-IRES-eGFP, Luciferase-dTomato-hFTH, CXCR4-IRES-eGFP.
2.After four days’work, we finally finished the second group and put them all into a 96-well format.
1.Using the part distribution to get another carrier annular carrier by Enzyme digestion, and put the third group of genes into the carrier by ligament.
The third group includes CXCR5-Luciferease-IRES-eGFP, CXCR4-Luciferease-IRES-eGFP, CXCR4-Luciferase-dTomato-hFTH
2.After four days’work, we finally finished the third group and put them all into another 96-well format.
