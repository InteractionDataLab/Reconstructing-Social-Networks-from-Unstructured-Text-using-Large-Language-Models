Figure 8.1
Chemokine receptor: CCR7 ( BBa_K1993001 )
A series of chemokine receptors were constructed to enhance the homing ability of MSCs, in which CCR7 is one of them. Overexpressed in our engineered MSCs and guided by corresponding chemokine, CCR7 could improve our engineered MSCs targeting to the inflamed lesions.

Marking protein: Luciferase-IRES-eGFP ( BBa_K1993008 )
Internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and enhanced GFP (eGFP) were fused to the C terminus of Luciferase to form the modified marking protein Luciferase-IRES-eGFP. By constructing such a making protein, we improved the function of the original part (BBa_K1071009) and the capacity of tracing cells in vivo and in vitro.

Figure 8.3
Marking protein: Luciferase-T2A-dTomato-T2A-hFTH ( BBa_K1993006 )
A multi-functional marking protein was constructed to locate our engineered MSCs. By constructing such a making protein, we improved the function of the original part (BBa_I712019) and the capacity of tracing cells in vivo and in vitro.

Figure 8.4
Device: CXCR5-IRES-eGFP ( BBa_K1993005 )
Such a device was constructed to confirm our goals in the DTH (delayed type hypersensitivity) animal model. It could enhance the homing ability of cells and confirm the targeting capacity of cells.

Figure 8.5
Device: CXCR4-T2A-Luciferase-IRES-eGFP( BBa_K1993009 )
Such a device was constructed to confirm our goals in the IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) animal model. It could enhance the homing ability of cells and report cells in vivo and in vitro which helped us confirm whether our cells located to inflamed sites.
