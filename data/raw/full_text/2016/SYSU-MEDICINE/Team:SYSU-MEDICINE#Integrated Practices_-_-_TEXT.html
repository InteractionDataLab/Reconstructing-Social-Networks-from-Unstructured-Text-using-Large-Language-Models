Integrated Human Practices
Human Practices group has been one of the critical parts of the project since the very beginning. Unlike experiment group, Human Practices concerns more about bringing the experimental results to real life.
At the beginning of the project, HP tried to find out whether MSCs were really effective in clinical application. We interviewed patients and doctors in order to know their attitudes towards MSCs therapy. The results showed that MSCs do have effectiveness but limited, which means MSCs cannot replace the regular anti-inflammatory medicine but have advantages in combination with medication. In consideration of this situation, we put up an idea of enhancing the effectiveness of MSCs and then had a deeply talk with our PIs.

During mid phage of our project, we devoted ourselves to study and investigate other aspects connected to our project including ethics , law and regulation , safety , product analysis including intellectual property rights and so on by literature studying, interview and questionnaire, attending Cell Therapy Annual Meeting, etc.
Time flies. It is almost the end phage of the project this year, but we don't want to stop here. We can do more and better! We have done a lot of researches and had many activities during the project and we admit that there is such a large room for us to improve. We have no time to finish them in this year but we draw a discussion of Room for Improvement for the teams next year.
