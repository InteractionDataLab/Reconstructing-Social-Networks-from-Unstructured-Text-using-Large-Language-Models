-----MSCs of
Next Generation
Inflammatory diseases are an increasing cause of disability and even fatality.                     Currently, apart from common treatments, MSCs therapy is a promising candidate for curing inflammatory diseases.                     However, intravascular injected MSCs are criticized for its low homing efficiency and ambiguous distribution in human body.
This year, MSCavalry: MSCs of Next Generation is coming.                     SYSU-MEDICINE decided to engineer a set of MSCs (homo sapiens) with higher accuracy and we hope that our project can pave the way for future MSCs clinical application.
