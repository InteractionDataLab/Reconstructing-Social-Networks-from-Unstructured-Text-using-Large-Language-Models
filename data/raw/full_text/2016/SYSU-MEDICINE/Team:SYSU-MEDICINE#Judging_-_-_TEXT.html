Judging Criteria
and Us
Since it is the first time for us, SYSU-MEDICINE, to participate in the iGEM competition. We try our best to meet many standards required for medals. Here is a list.
Bronze Medal (All are met.)
✓ Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
We were registered!
✓ Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page (section 3).
Team Wiki, Poster, Presentation, Project Attribution, Registry Part Pages, Sample Submission, Safety Forms, Safety Check-in, About Our Lab, About Our Project, Final Safety Form and Judging Form
✓ Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
This page on our team wiki is running.
✓ Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
We submitted and documented several parts, for example BBa_K1993001. The documentation could be found in the Registry or at our wiki.
Silver Medal (All are met.)
✓ Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #4.
We validated the functions of some parts we submitted to the Registry. As an example, you could check out BBa_K1993008. The results could be viewed in the Registry.
✓ Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbiotic problem.
We assisted Team ShanghaiTechChina_B with IBD (inflammatory bowel diseases) animal model establishment to confirm the function of EGF derived from modified E.coli to prove the effect of the peptide in vivo.
✓ iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams' exemplary work).
During the project, HP devoted to study and investigate different aspects closely related to our project including ethics, law and legislation, safety, product analysis, even summary of room for improvement by the methods of literature studying, interview, questionnaire, attending Cell Therapy Annual Meeting etc. HP also had dialogues with high school students, college students and ordinary citizens.
Gold Medal (All are met.)
✓ Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept. (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab).
The proof of concept was fully described on our Proof of Concept page. We explained and confirmed characteristics of our parts, such as BBa_K1993005, BBa_K1993009 and so on.
✓ Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
To make it a perfect project, HP devoted to study and investigate different aspects closely related to our project including ethics, law and legislation, safety, product analysis, even summary of room for improvement by the methods of literature studying, interview, questionnaire, attending Cell Therapy Annual Meeting etc. What made it specific was that we have been improving our project with the ongoing of HP work. Our HP also had dialogues with high school students, college students and ordinary citizens.
✓ Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab).
We showed it on our Demonstrate page. We constructed animal models (IBD and DTH) to demonstrate our whole system working under simulated conditions in the lab.
✓ Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part. This part must NOT be from your 2016 part number range.
We created a new part, BBa_K1993006, to improve the function of a previous part, BBa_I712019.
We also created a new part, BBa_K1993008, to improve the function of a previous part, BBa_K1071009.
