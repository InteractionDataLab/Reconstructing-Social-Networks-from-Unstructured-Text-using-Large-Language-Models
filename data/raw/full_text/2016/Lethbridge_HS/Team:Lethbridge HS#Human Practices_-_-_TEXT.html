Background
Despite the science involved in iGEM, our team also recognized the human practices portion as well. Members of our team participated in a variety of activities to both gain awareness from our community by sharing about our project, and also to gain insight from various individuals. This information guided the next steps that were taken in our project.
Members of our team worked in a variety of activities including public engagement, a survey, and conducting interviews. We also recognized that since our idea of increasing the efficiency of blood coagulation has never before been attempted by any other iGEM team before, to create a "Best Blood Practices" with the hopes of assisting future iGEM teams. The knowledge gained from working with the blood will be invaluable to future generations of iGEMers.
