BioBus
Founded in 2008, BioBus works towards a future in     which all people have experienced the power and     beauty of making a scientific discovery.
BioBase Workshop
The Columbia University iGEM demonstrates molecular     cloning protocols to high school students in New     York City.
ThinkSTEAM Workshop
ThinkSTEAM girls work the iGEM at Columbia     University to learn about synthetic biology and     careers in STEM.

Throughout the course of the project we maintained a Twitter    and Facebook account. We used these social media outlets as    a means of sharing our project progress with the    community. We posted interesting synthetic biology articles    as well as a means to keep the public updated about the    advances in the field. Additionally, we were able to    communicate with other iGEM teams around the world as a    platform for collaboration and synthetic biology discussion.
We have engaged in two different community outreach    workshops on synthetic biology: one with ThinkSTEAM and the    other with BioBase. ThinkSTEAM is a non-profit organization    that aims to encourage young girls of age from 12 to 18 to    pursue an endeavor in the STEM field.  BioBase is an    “interdisciplinary community science lab housed at the Lower    Eastside Girls Club” in which scientists join students and    the general public for hands-on scientific exploration. We    spent many weeks meeting with both organizations to develop    engaging and educational presentations. Additionally, we    planned and created original experiments to complete with    the students. At each event, we gave a short lecture on    synthetic biology and discussed our summer project. The    lecture component of the workshop was followed by the lab    tour and numbers of demonstrations involving hands-on    activities such as running a DNA gel, centrifuging cell    culture, and plating transformed cells. We made sure to    answer all questions students had and provided our contact    information so that they could contact us in the future    should any questions about synthetic biology or research    arise.
