If you were to ask your friend to list the most deadly      animals, he or she would probably include lions, tigers,      and bears (oh my!).  However, they may be surprised to      hear that the mosquito deserves a high place on this list.      According to the World Health Organization, mosquitos      account for more than one million deaths annually.  These      deaths are caused by mosquito-borne illnesses including      West Nile virus, elephantiasis, dengue fever, yellow      fever, malaria, and more recently Zika.  With the recent      outbreak of the Zika virus, the World Health Organization      and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have      labeled Zika as an international health concern.  With no      known treatments or vaccines currently available,      prevention is the only option to combat Zika.
Citronella oil and DEET are the main commercially      available repellents against Zika-carrying mosquitos, yet      these products possess several shortcomings.  Each      repellent stops being effective approximately three hours      after application.  However, many users are unaware of      this time frame.  Consequently, they are unprepared to      reapply and are left unprotected. Applying current      mosquito repellent can lead to a false sense of security,      which can cause a person to be more prone to mosquito      bites.  While citronella oil has a lower efficacy than      DEET, DEET has been shown to be harmful to skin, causing      painful rashes.  DEET is also harmful to the environment      since its chemical runoffs can disrupt neighboring      wildlife.  Although DEET and citronella oil are viable      mosquito repellents, they are by no means ideal.
Our project hopes to provide a safe, long-lasting mosquito      repellent using the microbiome.  Recent research has shown      that the biomolecule di-rhamnolipids, naturally produced      by Pseudomonas aeruginosas, effectively repels      mosquitos at low concentrations.  This biomolecule is      safer than DEET and more effective than citronella oil.      However, di-rhamnolipids are expensive to produce      synthetically. Furthermore, although naturally found on      human skin, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known to be      pathogenic. Pseudomonas putida, an environmental      strain found in soil, survives well on most surfaces, and      is non-pathogenic. Using P. putida, we are      designing a safe bacteria strain to produce      rhamnolipids. As a more long-term option, we will also be      modifying Staphylococcus epidermidis, a natural      skin microbe, to produce rhamnolipids. The probiotics      would be applied to the skin via a lotion rather than a      spray like most repellents to prevent the loss of the      product to the environment. These bacteria would      continuously produce the mosquito repellent on the skin      thereby increasing duration of efficacy as well as cost      effectiveness as less repellent would need to be      purchased.
The experimental plan is as follows: building a      recombinant plasmid with the genes necessary to produce      rhamnolipids, transforming this plasmid      into Pseudomonas putida and Staphylococcus      epidermidis, and quantifying the amount of      rhamnolipids produced by these engineered      strains. Rhamnolipid will be quantified using TLC, CTAB      assay, Orcinol Assay, and various spectrometry techniques      such as MS, HPLC-MS, and SFC-MS. Additionally, we will do      experiments to analyze the effects such biosynthetic      repellent will have on mosquitoes. Ultimately, we plan to      analyze the effects rhamnolipids have on skin by      conducting experiments in mice. Lastly, we hope to conduct      experiments that include both mice and mosquitoes to      assess to what extent the repellent is effective.
