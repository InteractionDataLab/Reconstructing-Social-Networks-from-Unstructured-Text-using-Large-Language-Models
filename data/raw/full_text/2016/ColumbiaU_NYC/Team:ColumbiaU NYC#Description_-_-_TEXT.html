Characterization of rhlAB
The RhlAB operon codes for mono-rhamnolipid, a virulence      factor naturally found in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It      contains the RhlA and RhlB genes within the operon, coding      for the final two enzymes in the mono-rhamnolipid      production pathway.  Rhamnolipids, consisting of a      rhamnose sugar attached to one or multiple lipid side      chains, has many uses and has been highlighted by previous      iGEM teams—such as Panama iGEM 2010—as a biosurfactant      capable of aiding oil recovery.
Furthermore, according to the article, "Rhamnolipids:      solution against Aedes Aegypti?" published by Universidade      Estadual Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho Rio Claro in      Brazil, this biosurfactant has a capability of repelling      mosquitoes as      well 1 .      Using this information, we have decided to create a      microorganism that secretes rhamnolipids constitutively      and can be applied to human skin with no safety hazards.
Although a BioBrick for RhlAB has been previously      documented by Team Panama in 2011, there was no      substantial characterization on this part.  Furthermore,      its ability to repel mosquitoes hasn't been documented or      characterized.  Our team this year, not only performed an      accurate quantitative analysis of the gene expression in      E. Coli, but also characterized in a different chassis,      Pseudomonas putida KT2440.  In addition, in order to      quantify how effectively rhamnolipids repel mosquitoes, we      conducted mosquito feeding and landing assays.  Finally,      we also tested the level of toxicity of RhlAB on a skin      microbiome, specifically, Staphylococcus epidermidis.
Mosquito landing and feeding assay
Aedes aegypti, the species of mosquito observed to carry      Zika virus, were grown from larval stage, and females were      sorted at the pupae or adult stage. Since only females      consume blood for reproduction, we were only interested in      using them for the assays.
One day before experiment, 50 mosquitos, containing 30      females, were isolated in cages and starved from 23-25      hours. Each cage was then taken to a warm room (~30 oC),      and the cage was covered with wet paper towels to preserve      humidity. For each trial, our blood feeding system (Figure      1) was then placed on top of the cage each with a      different cotton gauze soaked with negative control water,      1 mg/mL mono-rhamnolipid solution, 1 mg/mL di-rhamnolipid      solution, or positive control 25% DEET, and the mosquito      activity was videotaped for 1 hour. Afterwards, the cage      was taken to the cold room to paralyze the assayed      mosquitoes, and mosquitoes that had consumed blood were      counted. Our results showed that while DEET was the      strongest mosquito repellent with no landings or fed      mosquitos, 1 mg/mL mono and di-rhamnolipid still showed      significant repulsion as shown in the graph below.
Characterization of E. coli and P. putida
Because our team's aim was to create a "live mosquito      repellent" bacteria that constitutively produced      rhamnolipids, we focused on transforming two organisms:      Pseudomonas putida and Staphylococcus epidermidis.  Along      the way, we encountered many issues, suggesting that high      amounts of rhamnolipid may pose a metabolic burden or be      toxic to these species.  At the end, however, we      successfully electroporated our RhlAB construct with a      "low expression level" promoter into P. putida.
In order to accurately measure the amount of rhamnolipids      produced by our mutant strains, we used supercritical      fluid chromatography (SFC-MS). First, a test run was      executed with a mixture of mono-rhamnolipids and      di-rhamnolipids at the concentration of 5 mg/mL by running      the sample through the column packed with 2-PIC.  From      this test run, we have obtained the retention times of      mono-rhamnolipids (rha-C10-C10:      pseudomolecular ion of 503.56 m/z) and di-rhamnolipids      (rha-rha-C10-C10: pseudomolecular      ion of 649.8 m/z) to be approximately 3.974 min and 4.942      min respectively.  Then, a calibration curve was      constructed with 95% pure mono-rhamnolipids, and the limit      of detection was found to be approximately 5 ug/mL.  The      mass fractions were obtained from electrospray ionization      (ESI) negative mode.
From our TLC analysis, it was found that supplementing the      LB media with glucose is crucial to the production of      rhamnolipid. Therefore, for SFC-MS analysis, all the      mutant strains (E. Coli_RhlAB, E. Coli_L1_RhlAB, and      P. Putida_L1_RhlAB) were grown in LB supplemented with      glucose.  From the SFC-MS data, it was found that mutant      E. Coli strain makes more mono-rhamnolipids than mutant      P. putida.  Furthermore, the promoter strength was      confirmed as expected since the mutant E. coli strain      transformed with a high expression level promoter H2      produced almost 6 times more      rha-C10-C10.
Cloning rhlAB into skin microbiome and skin bacteria toxicity assays
Since Staphylococcus species, especially S. epidermidis,      are not commonly cloned, the cloning process was quite      challenging; more details can be seen under our protocol      section.  While we were unable to clone RhlAB into      Staphylococcus epidermidis, were we able to clone it into      the shuttle species Staphylococcus aureus. While S. Aureus      is pathogenic and cannot be used as a commensal skin      bacteria, our ability to clone RhlAB into it suggests that      it is possible for RhlAB to be produced in epidermidis.      Because the Staphylococcus species have never been cloned      to produce rhamnolipids, and rhamnolipids have been      characterized as antibiotic, we tested the effect of      different concentrations of rhamnolipids (2000 mg to 15.6      mg per liter) on Staphylococcal growth.
