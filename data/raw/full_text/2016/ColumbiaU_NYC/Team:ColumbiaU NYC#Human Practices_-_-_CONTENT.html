	  Throughout the course of the project we maintained a Twitter
	  and Facebook account. We used these social media outlets as
	  a means of sharing our project progress with the
	  community. We posted interesting synthetic biology articles
	  as well as a means to keep the public updated about the
	  advances in the field. Additionally, we were able to
	  communicate with other iGEM teams around the world as a
	  platform for collaboration and synthetic biology discussion.
	</P><P>
	  We have engaged in two different community outreach
	  workshops on synthetic biology: one with ThinkSTEAM and the
	  other with BioBase. ThinkSTEAM is a non-profit organization
	  that aims to encourage young girls of age from 12 to 18 to
	  pursue an endeavor in the STEM field.  BioBase is an
	  “interdisciplinary community science lab housed at the Lower
	  Eastside Girls Club” in which scientists join students and
	  the general public for hands-on scientific exploration. We
	  spent many weeks meeting with both organizations to develop
	  engaging and educational presentations. Additionally, we
	  planned and created original experiments to complete with
	  the students. At each event, we gave a short lecture on
	  synthetic biology and discussed our summer project. The
	  lecture component of the workshop was followed by the lab
	  tour and numbers of demonstrations involving hands-on
	  activities such as running a DNA gel, centrifuging cell
	  culture, and plating transformed cells. We made sure to
	  answer all questions students had and provided our contact
	  information so that they could contact us in the future
	  should any questions about synthetic biology or research
	  arise.
