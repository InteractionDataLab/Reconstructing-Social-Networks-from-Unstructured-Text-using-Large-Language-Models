Figure 1: Metabolic pathway of Pseudomonas    aeruginosa.
Rhamnolipids are naturally synthesized by the skin bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the metabolic pathway    illustrated in Figure 1.
In order to avoid the virulence factors of Pseudomonas      aeruginosa, bacterial strains with similar or shared    metabolic pathways to the one above were chosen as potential    candidates.  The final candidates were Pseudomonas putida and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Although S. epidermidis doesn't share the same exact pathway as P. aeruginosa, it is    a naturally-occurring skin microbiome and only need two    additional enzymes, RhlA and RhlB, to produce    mono-rhamnolipids.  rhlA and rhlB genes necessary for    mono-rhamnolipid synthesis were extracted from the P. aeruginosa P14 bacterial strain to be placed into the    modified plasmid pNJ3.1 for transformation into the desired    bacterial strains (Figure 2).  The plasmid pC194 and a    shuttle vector strain, S. aureus RN4220 (details on S. Epidermidis transformation are discussed in the    experiments and result section) were used for S. epidermidis transformations with the same basic design (Figure 2). The    conversion of mono-rhamnolipids to di-rhamnolipids requires    the additional gene rhlC, which was also extracted from P14    strain and cloned into the same pNJ3.1 vector (Figure 2).
The plasmid pNJ3.1 has a promoter library that includes    hundreds of constitutive promoters with the length of 180    base pairs taken from various microbiome.  It is located at    the upstream of the gene that codes for super-folded GFP,    and the expression level of each constitutive promoter is    quantified with the intensity of fluorescence excited at 480    nm and emitted at 511 nm.
