		Jacky Cheung is a 3rd year CC student at Columbia
		University, and he is currently a pre-medical student
		majoring in Computer Science and Biology. Apparently,
		according to the Meyer-Briggs personality test, his
		personality type is ENFP (A.K.A The Campaigner). He is
		not quite sure how he feels about this. He has been
		involved in Synthetic Biology research since high
		school and this year is his third year participating
		in iGEM. His emoji of choice is :p because he enjoys
		teasing his friends, but ^.^ and XD are a close second
		and third. To relax, he enjoys taking long walks along
		the pier and messing with his friends (especially
		Hudson). Something he is known for is asking to get
		cheesecake or pie at 2 A.M after finishing long coding
		assignments because he is dopamine-deprived. He is
		named after Hong-Kong pop sensation Jacky Cheung; and
		one of his aspirations in life is to top the
		aforementioned celebrity on Google after doing a
		search of his name.

		Harris Wang has joined Columbia University Medical
		Center as an Assistant Professor in the Columbia
		Initiative in Systems Biology and the Department of
		Pathology and Cell Biology. His research focuses on
		understanding the evolution of the ecosystems that
		develop within heterogeneous microbial
		communities. Using approaches from genome engineering,
		DNA synthesis, and next-generation sequencing, he
		studies how genomes in microbial populations form,
		maintain themselves, and change over time, both within
		and across microbial communities. His goal is to use
		synthetic biology approaches to engineer ecologies of
		microbial populations, such as those found in the gut
		and elsewhere in the human body, in ways that could
		improve human health.

		tools for large-scale signal integrity analysis of
		digital integrated circuits. The success of these
		tools led Cadence to acquire CadMOS in 2001.Current
		research interests interests focus on circuits for
		VLSI integrated circuits in deeply-scaled CMOS
		technologies, new technologies for electronics
		applications, and the application of integrated
		circuits for biology-related applications.

		Prof. Tal Danino's research explores the emerging
		intersection of systems biology, synthetic biology,
		and engineering, focusing on building a quantitative
		understanding of gene circuits and designing
		biological behaviors that have technological
		applications.  The interaction of microbes and tumors
		is a major target of his work, where DNA sequences and
		synthetic biology are used to program–microbes as
		diagnostics and therapeutics in cancer.  Dr. Danino
		also brings this science outside the laboratory as a
		TED Fellow and through science-art projects.

		Ambitious. Genius. Handsome. These adjectives only
		begin to illustrate the man that is James Gornet. Born
		from the fires of Hades and raised by wolves, he is
		the living embodiment of freedom. Men fear
		him. Children want to be him. In high school, James
		Gornet researched molecular computing—a branch
		of computing that utilizes DNA, biochemistry, and
		molecular biology instead of silicon-based
		transistors. Currently, he doing research in
		developmental neurobiology and axon
		pathfinding. Majoring in biomedical engineering with a
		minor in neuroscience, James Gornet hopes to pursue a
		PhD in computational and molecular neuroscience. His
		Myers-Briggs personality is ENTJ—known for the
		commander disposition. His emoji of choice is 濾
		because he was pressured by Rachel Mintz to put one in
		his biography. In his spare time, James Gornet enjoys
		exploring New York City and frequenting concerts.

		Kirsten Jung is originally from Seoul, Korea, but
		moved to the U.S. 8 years ago because her 15-year-old
		self mistakenly thought she could survive in a foreign
		country on her own and somehow managed to successfully
		convince her parents to leave her behind.  She is a
		rising senior at Columbia University, majoring in
		chemical engineering and music.  She works at a
		protein engineering laboratory on campus, specifically
		studying the metabolon structure of TCA cycle enzymes
		and their enzymatic activities.  Once graduating, she
		plans to attend a graduate school and to pursue her
		Ph.D. in chemical engineering, but ultimately she
		hopes to work in a R&amp;D department of a
		pharmaceutical company.  Her Myers Briggs personality
		is ESFJ, &quot;the consuls,&quot; and she doesn't have an emoji
		of choice because her cynical self thinks she is too
		cool to use an emoji.  In her spare time, she enjoys
		running, exploring the city, and cooking.

		Pre-med track in his third year at Columbia College as
		a Biology major with a Psychology concentration.  He
		was a member of the 2015 Columbia NYC iGEM team and
		hopes to attend medical school upon graduation.  His
		Myers Briggs personality result is INFP and emoji of
		choice is :trollface: as he enjoys messing with his
		friends in his spare time.  Other pastimes include
		several styles of dance including hip-hop, multiple
		styles of ballroom, and long walks on the beach.

		Vincent “Venti” Liu is originally from Beijing, China
		and moved to Walnut, California five years ago. He is
		a sophomore at Columbia Engineering majoring in
		Computer Science and also pursuing a minor in
		Statistics. Previously, he had worked in two molecular
		biology laboratories while in high school and spent a
		year in a biomaterials laboratory at Columbia. He
		boasts a Meyers-Briggs personality of ESTJ “The
		Executive”, which he thinks is the best of all. As a
		consequence of his altruistic personality and
		muscular, 6’3 physique, lab members respectfully refer
		to him as The Spotter, and not surprisingly his emoji
		of choice is, which really isn’t even a choice of
		his; it just makes sense. In his pastime, Vincent
		enjoys photography, bartending (exclusively for his
		friends, sorry), practicing Krav Maga, and getting
		swole. Though very cool, Vincent is actually chill and
		friendly, unlike the ostentatious and self-obsessed
		James.

		Immunology, or take a year off to intern with WHO or
		L’Oreal. Her Myers Briggs personality is INTJ, The
		Architect.  and her fave emoji is ^0^, because it can
		portray amusement, alarm, gloating, excitement and
		shock all at the same time; an amalgam of emotions,
		that is of course, necessary to portray at
		times. Theresa's leisure activities include learning
		languages (speak 5 fluently, and 3 like a
		kindergartener, hey, I'm trying!), volunteering to
		teach high schoolers about science in the Double
		Discovery Center, and climbing things: hills, trees...
		tall friends... all climbable surfaces welcome.
