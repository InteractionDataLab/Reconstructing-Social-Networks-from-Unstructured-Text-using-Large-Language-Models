	    Since we were working with Aedes Aegypti, a mosquito
	    strain able to carry Zika as well as a number of other
	    mosquito borne illnesses, we strove for our facilities and
	    practices to conform to Arthropod Containment Level
	    1(ARL-1) and Arthropod Containment Level 2(ARL-2)
	    guidelines. The aim of these guidelines is to prevent any
	    mosquitos from escaping the laberatory and biting humans,
	    becasue if a human they bit had Zika, that mosquito could
	    then transmit Zika to others. To achieve this end, we took
	    precautions while working with and disposing of
	    larval/pupal mosquitoes and adult mosquitos. For
	    larval/pupal mosquitoes (the stages in the mosquito life
	    cycle that they needed to be in water to survive), we made
	    sure to freeze all discard pupae and wastewater before
	    pouring down the sink to ensure no eggs would survive and
	    hatch in the Hudson river. If a container of waste was too
	    big to fit in the freezer, we would fill it with 10%
	    bleach overnight. All wastewater spills were also wiped
	    with bleach. Furthermore, when sorting out pupae from
	    larvae, we pulled out all pupae for each time sorting to
	    ensure no metamorphosed adult mosquitos would emerge when
	    we next opened the larvae container. A different set of
	    safety protocol was used to house adult mosquitos. Adults
	    were kept in “Bug-dorms” within in an incubator, so escape
	    when we were not around or resulting tripping/knocking
	    over a cage was unlikely. Any sorting of adults was done
	    in a 4-6 degree cold room, which immobilized the mosquitos
	    and prevented them from flying. If the mosquitoes had to
	    be access outside the cold room, we would use a safe
	    opening technique and hold a flap around our hand
	    closed. If any mosquito escaped, we would track it down
	    and kill it. When transporting a container of adult
	    mosquitos, we strove to keep the mosquito container in one
	    other layer of plastic in case of a container breach. To
	    dispose of adults, we left cages in the cold room for at
	    least a week.
