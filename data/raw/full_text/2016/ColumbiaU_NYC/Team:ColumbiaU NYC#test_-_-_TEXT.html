A Mosquito Repellent for Everyone.
Mosquitos are the most deadly animal, accounting                     for more than one million annual                     deaths. Mos(quit)o is a long-lasting,                     environmentally-friendly, safe alternative to                     currently available mosquito repellents.
Current mosquito repellents are harmful to the        environment. Since there is no mass chemical        manufacturing, Mos(quit)o is a more        environmentally-friendly alternative.
Current mosquito repellents last a maximum of three      hours. Mos(quit)o produces the mosquito repellent      continuously, affectively allowing the repellent to last      indefinitely.
