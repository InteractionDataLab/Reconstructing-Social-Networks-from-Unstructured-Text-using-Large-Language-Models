	    The RhlAB operon codes for mono-rhamnolipid, a virulence
	    factor naturally found in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It
	    contains the RhlA and RhlB genes within the operon, coding
	    for the final two enzymes in the mono-rhamnolipid
	    production pathway.  Rhamnolipids, consisting of a
	    rhamnose sugar attached to one or multiple lipid side
	    chains, has many uses and has been highlighted by previous
	    iGEM teams—such as Panama iGEM 2010—as a biosurfactant
	    capable of aiding oil recovery.
	  </P><P>
	    Furthermore, according to the article, &quot;Rhamnolipids:
	    solution against Aedes Aegypti?&quot; published by Universidade
	    Estadual Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho Rio Claro in
	    Brazil, this biosurfactant has a capability of repelling
	    mosquitoes as
	    well<SUP><A href="http://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00088">1</A></SUP>.
	    Using this information, we have decided to create a
	    microorganism that secretes rhamnolipids constitutively
	    and can be applied to human skin with no safety hazards.
	  </P><P>
	    Although a BioBrick for RhlAB has been previously
	    documented by Team Panama in 2011, there was no
	    substantial characterization on this part.  Furthermore,
	    its ability to repel mosquitoes hasn't been documented or
	    characterized.  Our team this year, not only performed an
	    accurate quantitative analysis of the gene expression in
	    E. Coli, but also characterized in a different chassis,
	    Pseudomonas putida KT2440.  In addition, in order to
	    quantify how effectively rhamnolipids repel mosquitoes, we
	    conducted mosquito feeding and landing assays.  Finally,
	    we also tested the level of toxicity of RhlAB on a skin
	    microbiome, specifically, Staphylococcus epidermidis.
	  </P><H2>Mosquito landing and feeding assay</H2><P>
	    Aedes aegypti, the species of mosquito observed to carry
	    Zika virus, were grown from larval stage, and females were
	    sorted at the pupae or adult stage. Since only females
	    consume blood for reproduction, we were only interested in
	    using them for the assays.
	  </P><P>
	    One day before experiment, 50 mosquitos, containing 30
	    females, were isolated in cages and starved from 23-25
	    hours. Each cage was then taken to a warm room (~30 oC),
	    and the cage was covered with wet paper towels to preserve
	    humidity. For each trial, our blood feeding system (Figure
	    1) was then placed on top of the cage each with a
	    different cotton gauze soaked with negative control water,
	    1 mg/mL mono-rhamnolipid solution, 1 mg/mL di-rhamnolipid
	    solution, or positive control 25% DEET, and the mosquito
	    activity was videotaped for 1 hour. Afterwards, the cage
	    was taken to the cold room to paralyze the assayed
	    mosquitoes, and mosquitoes that had consumed blood were
	    counted. Our results showed that while DEET was the
	    strongest mosquito repellent with no landings or fed
	    mosquitos, 1 mg/mL mono and di-rhamnolipid still showed
	    significant repulsion as shown in the graph below.
	  </P><H2>Characterization of <EM>E. coli</EM> and <EM>P. putida</EM></H2><P>
	    Because our team's aim was to create a &quot;live mosquito
	    repellent&quot; bacteria that constitutively produced
	    rhamnolipids, we focused on transforming two organisms:
	    Pseudomonas putida and Staphylococcus epidermidis.  Along
	    the way, we encountered many issues, suggesting that high
	    amounts of rhamnolipid may pose a metabolic burden or be
	    toxic to these species.  At the end, however, we
	    successfully electroporated our RhlAB construct with a
	    &quot;low expression level&quot; promoter into P. putida.
	  </P><P>
	    In order to accurately measure the amount of rhamnolipids
	    produced by our mutant strains, we used supercritical
	    fluid chromatography (SFC-MS). First, a test run was
	    executed with a mixture of mono-rhamnolipids and
	    di-rhamnolipids at the concentration of 5 mg/mL by running
	    the sample through the column packed with 2-PIC.  From
	    this test run, we have obtained the retention times of
	    mono-rhamnolipids (rha-C<SUB>10</SUB>-<SUB>C10</SUB>:
	    pseudomolecular ion of 503.56 m/z) and di-rhamnolipids
	    (rha-rha-C<SUB>10</SUB>-C<SUB>10</SUB>: pseudomolecular
	    ion of 649.8 m/z) to be approximately 3.974 min and 4.942
	    min respectively.  Then, a calibration curve was
	    constructed with 95% pure mono-rhamnolipids, and the limit
	    of detection was found to be approximately 5 ug/mL.  The
	    mass fractions were obtained from electrospray ionization
	    (ESI) negative mode.
	  </P><P>
	    From our TLC analysis, it was found that supplementing the
	    LB media with glucose is crucial to the production of
	    rhamnolipid. Therefore, for SFC-MS analysis, all the
	    mutant strains (E. Coli_RhlAB, E. Coli_L1_RhlAB, and
	    P. Putida_L1_RhlAB) were grown in LB supplemented with
	    glucose.  From the SFC-MS data, it was found that mutant
	    E. Coli strain makes more mono-rhamnolipids than mutant
	    P. putida.  Furthermore, the promoter strength was
	    confirmed as expected since the mutant E. coli strain
	    transformed with a high expression level promoter H2
	    produced almost 6 times more
	    rha-C<SUB>10</SUB>-<SUB>C10</SUB>.
	  </P><H2>Cloning rhlAB into skin microbiome and skin bacteria toxicity assays</H2><P>
	    Since Staphylococcus species, especially S. epidermidis,
	    are not commonly cloned, the cloning process was quite
	    challenging; more details can be seen under our protocol
	    section.  While we were unable to clone RhlAB into
	    Staphylococcus epidermidis, were we able to clone it into
	    the shuttle species Staphylococcus aureus. While S. Aureus
	    is pathogenic and cannot be used as a commensal skin
	    bacteria, our ability to clone RhlAB into it suggests that
	    it is possible for RhlAB to be produced in epidermidis.
	    Because the Staphylococcus species have never been cloned
	    to produce rhamnolipids, and rhamnolipids have been
	    characterized as antibiotic, we tested the effect of
	    different concentrations of rhamnolipids (2000 mg to 15.6
	    mg per liter) on Staphylococcal growth.
