Proof of Concept
The motto of our project is to create a mosquito repellent      that is long-lasting, environmentally-friendly, and safe to      human skin.  We have chosen rhamnolipids, a biosurfactant      naturally produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as the main      component of our repellent.  To prove and quantify the      molecule's repelling ability, we have conducted live      mosquito experiments.  There are two main types of      rhamnolipids: di-rhamnolipid and mono-rhamnolipid.  Previous      research proved that di-rhamnolipids effectively repel      mosquitoes when used at an appropriate concentration.      Before we test our BioBrick device, which is our mutant      Pseudomonas putida strain that produces mono-rhamnolipids      and di-rhamnolipids, we conducted the assay with pure      compounds to determine whether mono-rhamnolipids also has      the same repelling efficacy as di-rhamnolipids.  Water and      DEET were used as a negative and positive control,      respectively.  Our landing assay results showed that while      DEET was the strongest mosquito repellent with no landings      or fed mosquitos, 1 mg/mL mono and di-rhamnolipid still      showed significant repulsion as shown in the graph below.
Given the ability of mono-rhamnolipids and di-rhamnolipids      to repel mosquitoes, we hope to conduct the same assay with      our BioBrick device, P. putida KT2440 transformed with rhlAB      and with rhlC, for future work.
