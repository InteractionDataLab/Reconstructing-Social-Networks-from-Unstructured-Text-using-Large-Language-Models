Since we were working with Aedes Aegypti, a mosquito      strain able to carry Zika as well as a number of other      mosquito borne illnesses, we strove for our facilities and      practices to conform to Arthropod Containment Level      1(ARL-1) and Arthropod Containment Level 2(ARL-2)      guidelines. The aim of these guidelines is to prevent any      mosquitos from escaping the laberatory and biting humans,      becasue if a human they bit had Zika, that mosquito could      then transmit Zika to others. To achieve this end, we took      precautions while working with and disposing of      larval/pupal mosquitoes and adult mosquitos. For      larval/pupal mosquitoes (the stages in the mosquito life      cycle that they needed to be in water to survive), we made      sure to freeze all discard pupae and wastewater before      pouring down the sink to ensure no eggs would survive and      hatch in the Hudson river. If a container of waste was too      big to fit in the freezer, we would fill it with 10%      bleach overnight. All wastewater spills were also wiped      with bleach. Furthermore, when sorting out pupae from      larvae, we pulled out all pupae for each time sorting to      ensure no metamorphosed adult mosquitos would emerge when      we next opened the larvae container. A different set of      safety protocol was used to house adult mosquitos. Adults      were kept in “Bug-dorms” within in an incubator, so escape      when we were not around or resulting tripping/knocking      over a cage was unlikely. Any sorting of adults was done      in a 4-6 degree cold room, which immobilized the mosquitos      and prevented them from flying. If the mosquitoes had to      be access outside the cold room, we would use a safe      opening technique and hold a flap around our hand      closed. If any mosquito escaped, we would track it down      and kill it. When transporting a container of adult      mosquitos, we strove to keep the mosquito container in one      other layer of plastic in case of a container breach. To      dispose of adults, we left cages in the cold room for at      least a week.
