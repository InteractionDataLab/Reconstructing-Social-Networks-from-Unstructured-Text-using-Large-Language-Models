Personal Acknowledgements
We would like to acknowledge the work done by our      team. James Gornet cloned the BioBricks,      transformed P. putida, quantified the promoter      library strength, and designed the wiki. Rachel Mintz orchestrated the human practices      survey, implemented the keratinocyte experiments, planned      the community outreach events, and designed moderately      snazzy t-shirts. Jacky Cheung planned the      collaborations with several other iGEM teams. Theresa      Mensah designed the mice experiments and      cloned RhlAB in to S. epidermidis. Vincent Liu designed the logo and implemented the freeze-dry      experiments. Hudson Lee transformed P. putida and helped run the mosquito      experiments. Kirsten Jung quantified the      rhamnolipid output using several methods including SFC-MS, cloned RhlAB into P. putida, and run the mosquito experiments. Kaitlin Pet implemented both the mosquito and keratinocyte experiments.
Support from Principal Investigators and Mentors
We would like to thank the Principal      Investigator Harris Wang for meeting with      us on a weekly basis to discuss experimental findings,      provide advice, and track our progress as well as offering      his lab space for us to conduct experiments. We would like      to thank Virginia Cornish for allowing us      to utilize her lab space, equipment, and reagents to      conduct purification and quantification      experiments. Finally, we would like to thank Tal      Danino for helping us hone our presentation.
We would like to thank our junior and senior mentors— Carlotta Ronda, Miguel      Jimenez, Sonja Billerbeck, and Ross McBee—for continuously      providing project feedback, finding helpful articles to      hone our protocols, and helping us make connections with      other scientists.
Prince Lab at Columbia University Medical Center
Dr. Prince kindly provided keratinocytes,      human skin cells, for our experiments. She also supplied      us with the proper cell media, antibiotics, cell culture      plates, and flasks. Matthew Wickersham demonstrated proper cell culture techniques and answered      any questions that arose during our experiments. He also      provided us with a virulent strain      of P. aeruginosa.
Marraffini Lab at Rockefeller University
Thank you to Wenyan Jian who provided us with strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis. He also sent us the      protocol he uses for his experiments for Staphylococcus      epidermidis.
Vosshall Laboratory at Rockefeller University
Thank you to the Leslie Vosshall for      facilitating our purchase of mosquitoes. Isabel      Gutierrez who drove Kaitlin Pet to pick up      mosquitoes.
Fidock Laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center
Thank you to David Fidock for granting us      access to cold rooms, warm rooms, and incubators. A      special thank you to epidemiologist Kelly      Rubiano for providing us with advice,      recommending an experimental setup, and assisting with our      protocol.
