                  Mosquito-borne illnesses are responsible for the
                  deaths of more than 725,000 people annually, ranking
                  mosquitoes as the number one cause of animal-related
                  deaths<SUP><A href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Most-Lethal-Animal-Mosquito-Week">1</A></SUP>. These
                  illnesses include chikungunya virus, dengue virus,
                  Eastern equine encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis,
                  La Crosse encephalitis, malaria, St. Louis
                  encephalitis, West Nile virus, yellow fever, and
                  Zika
                  virus<SUP><A href="http://www.mosquito.org/mosquito-borne-diseases">2</A></SUP>. In
                  particular, Zika virus has been gathering much
                  attention this year as an international health
                  concern because pregnant women infected with Zika
                  give birth to babies with microcephaly - a rare
                  neurological birth defect that results in babies
                  being born with abnormally small heads and
                  developmental
                  issues<SUP><A href="http://www.mosquitoworld.net/when-mosquitoes-bite/diseases/">3</A></SUP>. Although
                  vaccines have been developed for certain
                  mosquito-borne illnesses, for the most part,
                  vaccines are not available, treatment options are
                  limited, and there are no definitive
                  cures<SUP><A href="http://www.mosquitoworld.net/when-mosquitoes-bite/diseases/">3</A></SUP>. In
                  other words, preventing mosquito bites is the best
                  method for dealing with mosquito-borne illnesses.

                    For this reason, mosquitoes repellents play a
                    major role in mosquito-borne illness prevention
                    (See our FAQ for more details on ways to prevent
                    mosquito bites). Currently, the most widely used
                    mosquito repellants are diethyltoluamide (DEET) -
                    based because it has been proven to be effective
                    in preventing bites from insects such as
                    mosquitoes, biting flies, fleas, and small flying
                    insects. Although DEET is generally safe for use
                    at appropriate concentrations and amounts, it has
                    been implicated in various health concerns,
                    including: damage to DNA in laboratory animals and
                    human cells due to the generation of free radical
                    species, DEET crossing the placenta in pregnant
                    lab animals and negatively affecting the nervous
                    system and behavior of offsprings, synergisms with
                    other pesticides, and causing rare toxic reactions
                    when used
                    improperly<SUP><A href="http://bugofff.com/is-deet-safe-the-pros-and-cons-of-deet-mosquito-repellent/">4</A></SUP>. On
                    top of the potential health concerns, DEET is a
                    suspected environmental contaminants that has been
                    implicated in harming the developing chicks of
                    birds<SUP><A href="http://bugofff.com/is-deet-safe-the-pros-and-cons-of-deet-mosquito-repellent/">4</A></SUP>
                    and being harmful towards fish and insects at
                    extremely high
                    concentrations<SUP><A href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/DEETgen.pdf">5</A></SUP>. It
                    is to be noted and emphasized, however, that under
                    proper use at concentrations designed for human
                    use, DEET is safe for use and has been approved by
                    the United States Environmental Agency.

                    The purpose of this project it to improve on
                    available mosquito repellents by providing a
                    natural, eco-friendly, and consumer-friendly
                    alternative. The reason that the synthetic DEET
                    compound is used so widely is because of its
                    comparatively long effectiveness compared to
                    natural alternatives such as citronella oil and
                    p-menthane-3,-8-diol (PMD). In order to resolve
                    this issue regarding duration of efficacy, we are
                    developing genetically engineered microbes that
                    release rhamnolipids, a commonly used
                    biosurfactant which has been shown to effectively
                    repel mosquitoes. By applying these engineered
                    microbes to the skin via a lotion, we hope to
                    provide a long-lasting mosquito repellent superior
                    to synthetically produced repellents like DEET.
                </P><H2><ID>Rhamnolipids repel <EM>Aedes aegypti</EM> mosquitos</ID></H2><P>
                    In order to quantify how effectively rhamnolipids
                    repel mosquitoes, we conducted mosquito feeding
                    and landing assays. Aedes aegypti, the species of
                    mosquito observed to carry Zika virus, were grown
                    from larval stage, and females were sorted at the
                    pupae or adult stage. Since only females consume
                    blood for reproduction, we were only interested in
                    using them for the assays.
                </P><P>
                    One day before experiment, 50 total mosquitos
                    (with 30 females) were isolated in cages and
                    starved from 23-25 hours. Each cage was then taken
                    to a warm room (~30 °C), and the cage was covered
                    with wet paper towels to preserve humidity. For
                    each trial, our blood feeding system (Figure) was
                    placed on top of the cage each with a cotton gauze
                    soaked with either negative control water, 1 mg/mL
                    mono-rhamnolipid solution, 1 mg/mL di-rhamnolipid
                    solution, or positive control 25% DEET, and the
                    mosquito activity was videotaped for 1
                    hour. Afterwards, the cage was taken to the cold
                    room to paralyze the assayed mosquitoes, and
                    mosquitoes that had consumed blood were
                    counted. It is important to note that the age of
                    female mosquitoes and the time of feeding played
                    an important role in how mosquitoes
                    behave. Typically, it is optimum to use female
                    mosquitoes of age from 4-6 days for feeding assays
                    as any mosquitoes older than this age range will
                    be too old to reproduce, and thereby not needing
                    to drink blood. Furthermore, their feeding is most
                    active 4 hours before dusk. Some of our trials
                    that didn’t meet these criteria did not result in
                    any feeding, but we did observe significant
                    difference in landing between the control and
                    rhamnolipids. Our landing assay results showed
                    that while DEET was the strongest mosquito
                    repellent with no landings or fed mosquitos, 1
                    mg/mL mono and di-rhamnolipid still showed
                    statistically significant repulsion as shown in
                    the graph below.

	      keratinocytes</H2><H3>Determination of rhamnolipid IC50</H3><P>
                    Keratinocytes, human skin cells, were grown for
                    several days. When the cells were 80% confluent,
                    they were seeded in 24 well plates at a density of
                    2.5105. The cells were weaned off of antibiotics
                    the following day before they were treated with
                    varying concentrations of rhamnolipids and the
                    reagent MTS. The MTS assay reveals the cell
                    viability of the cells. Using this information,
                    the data was normalized and statistically analyzed
                    to determine the keratinocyte IC50—or the
                    concentration of rhamnolipid that induces 50% cell
                    death. The IC50 was determined to be between 45.19
                    µ/mL and 65.52 µ/mL. Relating the results to
                    rhamnolipid quantification, the concentration of
                    rhamnolipid the construct produces should not
                    cause significant cell death.
                </P><H3>Keratinocyte cell viability bacteria assay</H3><P>
                    Keratinocytes were co-cultured with different
                    strains of bacteria (<EM>Pseudomonas putida</EM>,
                    <EM>Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAK</EM>, <EM>Staphylococcus aureus</EM>,

                    <EM>P. putida</EM>). Half were cultured in plain DMEM with
                    serum, and half were culture in DMEM with 1 mg/mL
                    mixed mono- and di- rhamnolipids. After
                    co-culturing, the keratinocytes were washed with
                    PBS, exposed to gentamicin in an attempt to kill
                    the bacteria, and incubated in MTS cell viability
                    assay for up to 4 hours and viewed in a plate
                    reader. MTS assay is colorimetric cell viability
                    assay and reacts with NADPH-dependent
                    dehydrogenase enzymes, which are only active in
                    live (metabolically active)
                    cells<SUP><A href="http://www.biovision.com/manuals/K300.pdf">6</A></SUP>. For
                    the MTS assay, pure media were used as a negative
                    control (100% cell death), and keratinocyte
                    culture with normal DMEM was used as a positive
                    control (“0%” cell death, or the maximum number of
                    cells that could be alive).
                </P><P>
                    We originally tried to do plating experiments to
                    see if keratinocytes internalized any bacteria,
                    but were unable to completely kill off all the
                    bacteria in the keratinocyte supernatant even at
                    extremely high gentamicin concentrations and thus
                    could not get an accurate read.
                </P><P>
                    The results indicate that there is no consistent
                    trend regarding the addition of rhamnolipid and
                    cell viability. Rhamnolipids did not significantly
                    increase or decrease cell viability regardless of
                    the bacteria type as shown in the first figure
                    since the error bars overlap. We hypothesized that
                    the concentration of <EM>P. putida</EM> would not influence
                    cell viability as it is an environmental strain
                    not nearly as potent as other bacterial strains
                    such as <EM>Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAK</EM>. As depicted in
                    the second figure, all MOIs (ranging from 0 to 20)
                    did not significantly influence the cell viability
                    of the strain as shown by the overlapping error
                    bars in the graph. These results overall indicate
                    that our construct may not cause significant cell
                    death once applied to the skin in an acute setting
                    of a few hours.

                    two additional enzymes, RhlA and RhlB, to produce
                    mono-rhamnolipids. Genes rhlA and rhlB necessary
                    for mono-rhamnolipid synthesis were extracted from
                    the <EM>P. aeruginosa P14</EM> bacterial strain. These

                  the sugar in
                  rhamnolipids<SUP><A href="http://doi.org/10.1007/s10529-009-0049-7">7</A></SUP>. When
                  rhamnolipid is present, it forms blue halos around
                  the compound, and the halo size usually correlates
                  to the amount of
                  rhamnolipids<SUP><A href="http://doi.org/10.1007/s10529-009-0049-7">7</A></SUP>. We
                  tested this method with 95% pure rhamnolipids
                  (Sigma-Aldrich) by plating different concentrations
                  of the compound dissolved in water onto SW agar
                  plate*. Blue halos were present after incubating the
                  plate for 24 hours at 37°C, but the limit of
                  detection was too high (~1g/L). Furthermore,
                  depending on the amount of CTAB used per plate, the
                  size of halos varied, which made it difficult for us
                  to use this method as a quantitative measurement.
                </P><H4>Thin-layer chromatography</H4><P>
                    Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was used as a more
                    reliable method of detecting rhamnolipids. TLC is
                    a very common separation technique used to isolate
                    a desired compound from a mixture. It typically
                    involves two different phases, stationary and
                    mobile, in which the mobile phase flows through
                    the stationary phase and carries the components of
                    the mixture with
                    it<SUP><A href="http://www.chemguide.co.uk/analysis/chromatography/thinlayer.html">8</A></SUP>. Separation
                    of compounds is based on the affinity of the
                    compound towards the stationary phase vs. the
                    mobile phase, and depending on which phase the
                    compounds prefer, they travel with the solvent at
                    different
                    rates<SUP><A href="http://www.chemguide.co.uk/analysis/chromatography/thinlayer.html">8</A></SUP>. We
                    used silica gel as the stationary phase and
                    solvent consisted of chloroform, methanol, and
                    acetic acid in 65:15:2 % volume ratio as the
                    mobile phase. Knowing that di-rhamnolipids have
                    more hydroxyl groups, we predicted it to have a
                    smaller retention factor than mono-rhamnolipids as
                    they would prefer to stay on polar silica gel. To
                    visualize the plate, the silica gel plate was
                    stained with four different dyes: CAM, KMnO4,
                    orcinol with 50% H2SO4, and orcinol with 10%
                    H2SO4. Among the four staining methods, orcinol
                    with 10% gave the best visibility. The chemical
                    mechanism in which orcinol and sulfuric acid react
                    with rhamnose to create a dye is illustrated in
                    Figure 2.
                </P><P>
                    We confirmed that TLC method shows two distinct
                    bands for mono-rhamnolipids and di-rhamnolipids,
                    and that it has a limit of detection lower than
                    CTAB (approximately 0.5 mg/mL). Next, we tested
                    our mutant <EM>P. putida</EM> and <EM>E. coli</EM> strains with
                    promoters of different strengths. For positive
                    controls, WT <EM>P. aeruginosa</EM> and mutant
                    <EM>P. aeruginosa</EM> were used, and for a negative
                    control, WT <EM>P. putida</EM> was tested. When the cells
                    were grown in LB only media, none of the
                    rhamnolipids was detected from <EM>P. putida</EM> or
                    <EM>E. coli</EM>. However, when the cells were grown in LB
                    supplemented with glucose, a faint band for
                    mono-rhamnolipids was detected from mutant <EM>E. coli</EM>
                    transformed with a high expression level
                    promoter. Although our construct in <EM>P. putida</EM>
                    didn’t show any clear band, mutant <EM>P. aeruginosa</EM>
                    transformed with the same construct showed to
                    produce a lot more mono-rhamnolipids compared to
                    WT <EM>P. aeruginosa</EM>, which mainly produces
                    di-rhamnolipids. This result confirms that our
                    construct is working as expected, yet we need a
                    detection method with higher sensitivity.
                </P><H4>Supercritical fluid chromatography</H4><P>
                    In order to accurately measure the amount of
                    rhamnolipids produced by our mutant strains, we
                    used supercritical fluid chromatography
                    (SFC-MS). First, a test run was executed with a
                    mixture of mono-rhamnolipids and di-rhamnolipids
                    at the concentration of 5 mg/mL by running the
                    sample through the column packed with 2-PIC. From
                    this test run, we have obtained the retention
                    times of mono-rhamnolipids (rha-C<SUB>10</SUB>-C<SUB>10</SUB>:
                    pseudomolecular ion of 503.56 m/z) and
                    di-rhamnolipids (rha-rha-C<SUB>10</SUB>-C<SUB>10</SUB>: pseudomolecular
                    ion of 649.8 m/z) to be approximately 3.974 min
                    and 4.942 min respectively. Then, a calibration
                    curve was constructed with 95% pure
                    mono-rhamnolipids, and the limit of detection was
                    found to be approximately 5 µ/mL. The mass
                    fractions were obtained from electrospray
                    ionization (ESI) negative mode.
                </P><P>
                    From our TLC analysis, it was found that
                    supplementing the LB media with glucose is crucial
                    to the production of rhamnolipid. Therefore, for
                    SFC-MS analysis, all the mutant strains
                    (E. Coli_RhlAB, E. Coli_L1_RhlAB, and
                    P. putida_L1_RhlAB) were grown in LB supplemented
                    with glucose. From the SFC-MS data, it was found
                    that mutant <EM>E. coli</EM> strain makes more
                    mono-rhamnolipids than mutant
                    <EM>P. putida</EM>. Furthermore, the promoter strength was
                    confirmed as expected since the mutant <EM>E. coli</EM>
                    strain transformed with a high expression level
                    promoter H2 produced almost 6 times more
                    rha-C<SUB>10</SUB>-C<SUB>10</SUB>.

                    In order to investigate the optimum growth
                    conditions for rhamnolipid by the mutant <EM>P. putida</EM>
                    strain, the amount of glucose added and the time
                    of growth were varied. Using the calibration curve
                    above, we were able to measure the accurate amount
                    of rhamnolipids produced in each cell
                    culture. From this data, we have concluded that
                    <EM>P. putida</EM> produces the most mono-rhamnolipids when
                    grown for 24 hours in the media LB supplemented
                    with 50 g/L of glucose.

                    We have also tested the mutant strain of <EM>S. aureus</EM>
                    RN4220, the strain that carries shuttle vector for
                    <EM>S. epidermidis</EM>. Unfortunately, SFC-MS data didn't
                    show any production of rhamnolipids from <EM>S. aureus</EM>
                    strain.

                    In order to investigate the amount of

                    gene. It was grown under the same condition of 24
                    hours incubation in LB media supplemented by 50
                    g/L of glucose. Approximately 142 µ/mL of

	      for <EM>P. putida</EM> storage</ID></H3><P>
                    Since our product is designed to be eventually
                    applied for every-day use, it therefore must be
                    commercially viable, and a key to its commercial
                    value is shelf life. Freezing is the usual
                    treatment of commercially available products
                    containing live bacterial culture; however, the
                    associated cost is rather high and would render
                    our product uncompetitive relative to existing
                    products if freezing were the storage method
                    chosen. Exploring other options, we decided to try
                    freeze-drying, which is most commonly employed to
                    treat bacteria for probiotic products. A huge
                    advantage of the method is that freeze-dried
                    bacteria can be stored at room temperature, which
                    would drastically reduce the storage cost of the
                    product and make the product accessible to many
                    underdeveloped countries where mosquito-repellent
                    is especially needed. The method manipulates
                    pressure and temperature conditions so that water
                    molecules within the cell undergo sublimation,
                    preserving cellular integrity and properties.

                    Nevertheless, the existing snap-freeze protocols
                    are mostly designed for common lab strains such as
                    <EM>E. coli</EM>, so we experimented with different
                    formulations for the lyoprotectant and rehydration
                    media to optimize the protocol and to maximize
                    post-freeze-dry survival rate for
                    <EM>P. putida</EM>. Briefly, cells were grown to desired
                    turbidity, collected, and washed. Pellets are
                    resuspended in lyoprotectant containing 10%
                    sucrose w/ LB and stored in -20 °C until
                    frozen. Frozen samples are then incubated in
                    liquid nitrogen to further reduce the temperature
                    and freeze-dried in a lyophilizer for 24
                    hours. Samples are subsequently collected, sealed
                    with parafilm, and stored in a dessicator. To
                    rehydrate, Rehydration media (LB) is added to
                    dried samples and the liquid rehydration culture
                    is incubated at room temperature for 40 minutes.
                </P><P>
                    To test the relationship between storage time and
                    survival rate, we freeze-dried cells from the same
                    liquid culture and rehydrated them at different
                    time points to observe change in viable cell
                    concentration over time. The result is shown in
                    Figure.
                </P><P>
                    Additionally, it was found that the survival rate
                    for snap-freeze is still much higher than than
                    that of freeze-dry; about 72% of <EM>P. putida</EM>
                    survived after the time point of 28 days. Although
                    the survival rate dropped to nearly zero after 28
                    days, there is still a considerable amount of
                    bacteria left (~104 CFU/ml) that could potentially
                    reproduce and secrete rhamnolipid. These results
                    could perhaps be improved with more specialized
                    lyophilizer since the one we had available was
                    mainly for chemical use. Moreover, we could also
                    potentially improve the result with a more
                    advanced moisture-control method such as air-tight
                    sealing.

                    Overall, the team was successful in engineering a
                    harmless strain of bacteria that can secrete
                    rhamnolipids as a means to prevent mosquito
                    bites. Rhamnolipid quantification assays indicated
                    that while the construct does produce
                    rhamnolipids, the amount must be amplified in
                    order to ensure complete protection from
                    mosquitoes. Mosquito experiments demonstrated that
                    once the concentration is elevated mosquitoes will
                    be repelled by the rhamnolipids produced by the
                    team's construct.

                    Regarding safety, rhamnolipid survival assays show
                    that Rhamnolipid will not severely affect the
                    growth of skin bacteria such as <EM>S. epidermidis</EM> and
                    <EM>S. aureus</EM>. Staphylococcus transformation was
                    attempted and would have been a more permanent
                    solution for Rhamnolipid productions, since
                    <EM>S. epidermidis</EM> is a natural 70% coloniser of human
                    skin. Keratinocytes experiments revealed that
                    safety is not a prominent worry as rhamnolipids
                    did not significantly cause cell death of healthy
                    human skin cells in an acute setting nor did high
                    concentration of bacteria cause significant cell
                    death. Mouse experiments were planned and will be
                    the final stage of safety procedures after
                    optimizing rhamnolipid production by the bacteria
                    construct.

                    Several experiments were conducted to assess the
                    sustainability of our product or potential
                    shelf-life if it is commercialized as a legitimate
                    lotion. Freeze-dry versus snap freeze comparisons
                    show that snap freeze is more effective at
                    maintaining long-term bacterial survival, but
                    freeze-dry maintains its position as the more
                    practical preservation method given it needs only
                    a desiccator as opposed to a -80 °C freezer for
                    transport. Consequently, future experiments can be
                    done to tweak the protocol and/or lyoprotectant to
                    improve survival rates for consistent rhamnolipid
                    production levels.
