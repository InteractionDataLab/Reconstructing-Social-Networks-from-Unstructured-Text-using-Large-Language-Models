Our team realized that in order to engineer a product to    prevent mosquito bites we needed to engage with the    community at large to understand the problem from a holistic    perspective. Thus, we designed a 20 item survey to assess    the knowledge of the community regarding mosquito repellent    and mosquito borne illnesses, which we distributed to over    250 people via the website SurveyMonkey. The survey reached    people in more than twenty states and four countries.
The inferential statistics revealed that people suffer from    mosquito bites year round even though people use    repellent. However, most people did not know whether the    repellent contained the highly toxic component DEET, which    indicates a void in safety knowledge. Of those who used    DEET, there was no correlation found between use of DEET    based mosquito repellent and perceived effectiveness. Thus,    we compiled a list of frequently asked questions about    mosquito repellent use as a prevention strategy for mosquito    borne illnesses, answered them, and distributed the    information to local schools to enhance community    knowledge. We also wanted to ensure that our mosquito    repellent would be need of our community so we included a    few market analysis questions in which participants ranked    the importance of mosquito repellent characteristics such as    color and smell that we considered throughout our research.
