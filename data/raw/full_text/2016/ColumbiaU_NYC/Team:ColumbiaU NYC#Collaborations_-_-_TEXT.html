University of Georgia
The University of Georgia iGEM team is continuing their work    on developing the archaeal Methanococcus maripaludis as an    inexpensive chassis for synthetic biochemical production    with a current focus on engineering the ribosomal binding    site (RBS). An mCherry reporter is used to measure protein    expression. In the team's efforts to standardize    fluorescence measurements and collect data, we are helping    the UGA iGEM team characterize RBS variants by measuring    mCherry fluorescence levels using flow cytometry and    performing statistical analysis.
Imperial College London
The Imperial College London iGEM team are working on a    co-culture technology that allows for self-regulating    artificial cell population ratios through cell communication    and regulation. As such, the team is also collecting data on    growth conditions in various medias. Here, we contributed to    the team's efforts by providing data on Pseudomonas    putida growth at different mixture ratios of LB and BHI    and determining the growth curve in each mixture at OD    600. This effort also benefitted us by granting us insight    into how P. putida containing our construct will fare in    these mixed media conditions compared to the wild-type    strain.
Genspace
The Genspace iGEM team is a team composed of high-schoolers    and citizen scientists working at a community laboratory. As    such, access to certain lab equipment is typically    limited. As a result, the Columbia iGEM team have worked    with the team members to help collect data on their    behalf. This year, we aided the Genspace team in their    efforts to collect data for the UGA-Georgia    team 1 and characterize    constructs by collecting data on cell growth at OD 700 and    collecting mTurquoise2 and mCherry fluorescence.
