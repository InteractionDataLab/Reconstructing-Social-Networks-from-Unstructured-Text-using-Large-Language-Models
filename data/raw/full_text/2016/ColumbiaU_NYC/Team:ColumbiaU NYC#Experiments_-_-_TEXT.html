Introduction
Mosquito-borne illnesses are responsible for the                   deaths of more than 725,000 people annually, ranking                   mosquitoes as the number one cause of animal-related                   deaths 1 . These                   illnesses include chikungunya virus, dengue virus,                   Eastern equine encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis,                   La Crosse encephalitis, malaria, St. Louis                   encephalitis, West Nile virus, yellow fever, and                   Zika                   virus 2 . In                   particular, Zika virus has been gathering much                   attention this year as an international health                   concern because pregnant women infected with Zika                   give birth to babies with microcephaly - a rare                   neurological birth defect that results in babies                   being born with abnormally small heads and                   developmental                   issues 3 . Although                   vaccines have been developed for certain                   mosquito-borne illnesses, for the most part,                   vaccines are not available, treatment options are                   limited, and there are no definitive                   cures 3 . In                   other words, preventing mosquito bites is the best                   method for dealing with mosquito-borne illnesses.
For this reason, mosquitoes repellents play a                     major role in mosquito-borne illness prevention                     (See our FAQ for more details on ways to prevent mosquito bites). Currently, the most widely used                     mosquito repellants are diethyltoluamide (DEET) -                     based because it has been proven to be effective                     in preventing bites from insects such as                     mosquitoes, biting flies, fleas, and small flying                     insects. Although DEET is generally safe for use                     at appropriate concentrations and amounts, it has                     been implicated in various health concerns,                     including: damage to DNA in laboratory animals and                     human cells due to the generation of free radical                     species, DEET crossing the placenta in pregnant                     lab animals and negatively affecting the nervous                     system and behavior of offsprings, synergisms with                     other pesticides, and causing rare toxic reactions                     when used                     improperly 4 . On                     top of the potential health concerns, DEET is a                     suspected environmental contaminants that has been                     implicated in harming the developing chicks of                     birds 4 and being harmful towards fish and insects at                     extremely high                     concentrations 5 . It                     is to be noted and emphasized, however, that under                     proper use at concentrations designed for human                     use, DEET is safe for use and has been approved by                     the United States Environmental Agency.
The purpose of this project it to improve on                     available mosquito repellents by providing a                     natural, eco-friendly, and consumer-friendly                     alternative. The reason that the synthetic DEET                     compound is used so widely is because of its                     comparatively long effectiveness compared to                     natural alternatives such as citronella oil and                     p-menthane-3,-8-diol (PMD). In order to resolve                     this issue regarding duration of efficacy, we are                     developing genetically engineered microbes that                     release rhamnolipids, a commonly used                     biosurfactant which has been shown to effectively                     repel mosquitoes. By applying these engineered                     microbes to the skin via a lotion, we hope to                     provide a long-lasting mosquito repellent superior                     to synthetically produced repellents like DEET.
Rhamnolipids repel Aedes aegypti mosquitos
In order to quantify how effectively rhamnolipids                     repel mosquitoes, we conducted mosquito feeding                     and landing assays. Aedes aegypti, the species of                     mosquito observed to carry Zika virus, were grown                     from larval stage, and females were sorted at the                     pupae or adult stage. Since only females consume                     blood for reproduction, we were only interested in                     using them for the assays.
One day before experiment, 50 total mosquitos                     (with 30 females) were isolated in cages and                     starved from 23-25 hours. Each cage was then taken                     to a warm room (~30 °C), and the cage was covered                     with wet paper towels to preserve humidity. For                     each trial, our blood feeding system (Figure) was                     placed on top of the cage each with a cotton gauze                     soaked with either negative control water, 1 mg/mL                     mono-rhamnolipid solution, 1 mg/mL di-rhamnolipid                     solution, or positive control 25% DEET, and the                     mosquito activity was videotaped for 1                     hour. Afterwards, the cage was taken to the cold                     room to paralyze the assayed mosquitoes, and                     mosquitoes that had consumed blood were                     counted. It is important to note that the age of                     female mosquitoes and the time of feeding played                     an important role in how mosquitoes                     behave. Typically, it is optimum to use female                     mosquitoes of age from 4-6 days for feeding assays                     as any mosquitoes older than this age range will                     be too old to reproduce, and thereby not needing                     to drink blood. Furthermore, their feeding is most                     active 4 hours before dusk. Some of our trials                     that didn’t meet these criteria did not result in                     any feeding, but we did observe significant                     difference in landing between the control and                     rhamnolipids. Our landing assay results showed                     that while DEET was the strongest mosquito                     repellent with no landings or fed mosquitos, 1                     mg/mL mono and di-rhamnolipid still showed                     statistically significant repulsion as shown in                     the graph below.
P. putida, S. epidermidis,        and rhamnolipids are compatible with human        keratinocytes
Determination of rhamnolipid IC50
Keratinocytes, human skin cells, were grown for                     several days. When the cells were 80% confluent,                     they were seeded in 24 well plates at a density of                     2.5105. The cells were weaned off of antibiotics                     the following day before they were treated with                     varying concentrations of rhamnolipids and the                     reagent MTS. The MTS assay reveals the cell                     viability of the cells. Using this information,                     the data was normalized and statistically analyzed                     to determine the keratinocyte IC50—or the                     concentration of rhamnolipid that induces 50% cell                     death. The IC50 was determined to be between 45.19 µ/mL and 65.52 µ/mL. Relating the results to                     rhamnolipid quantification, the concentration of                     rhamnolipid the construct produces should not                     cause significant cell death.
Keratinocyte cell viability bacteria assay
Keratinocytes were co-cultured with different                     strains of bacteria (Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAK, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and mutant rhlAB P. putida). Half were cultured in plain DMEM with                     serum, and half were culture in DMEM with 1 mg/mL                     mixed mono- and di- rhamnolipids. After                     co-culturing, the keratinocytes were washed with                     PBS, exposed to gentamicin in an attempt to kill                     the bacteria, and incubated in MTS cell viability                     assay for up to 4 hours and viewed in a plate                     reader. MTS assay is colorimetric cell viability                     assay and reacts with NADPH-dependent                     dehydrogenase enzymes, which are only active in                     live (metabolically active)                     cells 6 . For                     the MTS assay, pure media were used as a negative                     control (100% cell death), and keratinocyte                     culture with normal DMEM was used as a positive                     control (“0%” cell death, or the maximum number of                     cells that could be alive).
We originally tried to do plating experiments to                     see if keratinocytes internalized any bacteria,                     but were unable to completely kill off all the                     bacteria in the keratinocyte supernatant even at                     extremely high gentamicin concentrations and thus                     could not get an accurate read.
The results indicate that there is no consistent                     trend regarding the addition of rhamnolipid and                     cell viability. Rhamnolipids did not significantly                     increase or decrease cell viability regardless of                     the bacteria type as shown in the first figure                     since the error bars overlap. We hypothesized that                     the concentration of P. putida would not influence                     cell viability as it is an environmental strain                     not nearly as potent as other bacterial strains                     such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAK. As depicted in                     the second figure, all MOIs (ranging from 0 to 20)                     did not significantly influence the cell viability                     of the strain as shown by the overlapping error                     bars in the graph. These results overall indicate                     that our construct may not cause significant cell                     death once applied to the skin in an acute setting                     of a few hours.
Mutant rhlAB P. putida produces rhamnolipids
Transformation of P. putida KT2440
In order to avoid the virulence factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterial strains with                     similar or shared metabolic pathways to the one                     above were chosen as potential candidates. The                     final candidates were Pseudomonas putida and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Although S. epidermidis doesn’t share the same exact                     pathway as P. aeruginosa, it is a naturally-occurring skin microbiome and only need                     two additional enzymes, RhlA and RhlB, to produce                     mono-rhamnolipids. Genes rhlA and rhlB necessary                     for mono-rhamnolipid synthesis were extracted from                     the P. aeruginosa P14 bacterial strain. These                     genes were cloned into the modified plasmid pNJ3.1                     using standard cloning methods for transformation                     into the desired bacterial strains (Figure 2). The                     plasmid pC194 and a shuttle vector strain, S. aureus RN4220 (details on S. epidermidis transformation are discussed in the experiments                     and result section) were used for S. epidermidis transformations with the same basic design (Figure                     3). The conversion of mono-rhamnolipids to                     di-rhamnolipids requires the additional gene rhlC,                     which was also extracted from P14 strain and                     cloned into the same pNJ3.1 vector (Figure 4).
Quantification of rhamnolipids
To confirm the presence of rhamnolipids produced                     by our mutant strains (P. putida, E. coli transformed with pNJ3.1_rhlAB), we explored three                     different methods: cetyl trimethylammonium bromide                     agar plating (CTAB), thin-layer chromatography                     (TLC), and supercritical fluid chromatography mass                     spectrometry (SFC-MS). For TLC and SFC-MS                     analysis, rhamnolipids were extracted from cell                     culture supernatant through liquid-liquid                     extraction with ethyl acetate and redissolved in                     methanol prior to measurement. Detailed protocols                     on the extraction is discussed under protocols.
Cetyl trimethylammonium bromide agar plate assay
Cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) agar plates                   detect the presence of rhamnolipid by reacting with                   the sugar in                   rhamnolipids 7 . When                   rhamnolipid is present, it forms blue halos around                   the compound, and the halo size usually correlates                   to the amount of                   rhamnolipids 7 . We                   tested this method with 95% pure rhamnolipids                   (Sigma-Aldrich) by plating different concentrations                   of the compound dissolved in water onto SW agar                   plate*. Blue halos were present after incubating the                   plate for 24 hours at 37°C, but the limit of                   detection was too high (~1g/L). Furthermore,                   depending on the amount of CTAB used per plate, the                   size of halos varied, which made it difficult for us                   to use this method as a quantitative measurement.
Thin-layer chromatography
Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was used as a more                     reliable method of detecting rhamnolipids. TLC is                     a very common separation technique used to isolate                     a desired compound from a mixture. It typically                     involves two different phases, stationary and                     mobile, in which the mobile phase flows through                     the stationary phase and carries the components of                     the mixture with                     it 8 . Separation                     of compounds is based on the affinity of the                     compound towards the stationary phase vs. the                     mobile phase, and depending on which phase the                     compounds prefer, they travel with the solvent at                     different                     rates 8 . We                     used silica gel as the stationary phase and                     solvent consisted of chloroform, methanol, and                     acetic acid in 65:15:2 % volume ratio as the                     mobile phase. Knowing that di-rhamnolipids have                     more hydroxyl groups, we predicted it to have a                     smaller retention factor than mono-rhamnolipids as                     they would prefer to stay on polar silica gel. To                     visualize the plate, the silica gel plate was                     stained with four different dyes: CAM, KMnO4,                     orcinol with 50% H2SO4, and orcinol with 10%                     H2SO4. Among the four staining methods, orcinol                     with 10% gave the best visibility. The chemical                     mechanism in which orcinol and sulfuric acid react                     with rhamnose to create a dye is illustrated in                     Figure 2.
We confirmed that TLC method shows two distinct                     bands for mono-rhamnolipids and di-rhamnolipids,                     and that it has a limit of detection lower than                     CTAB (approximately 0.5 mg/mL). Next, we tested                     our mutant P. putida and E. coli strains with                     promoters of different strengths. For positive                     controls, WT P. aeruginosa and mutant P. aeruginosa were used, and for a negative                     control, WT P. putida was tested. When the cells                     were grown in LB only media, none of the                     rhamnolipids was detected from P. putida or E. coli. However, when the cells were grown in LB                     supplemented with glucose, a faint band for                     mono-rhamnolipids was detected from mutant E. coli transformed with a high expression level                     promoter. Although our construct in P. putida didn’t show any clear band, mutant P. aeruginosa transformed with the same construct showed to                     produce a lot more mono-rhamnolipids compared to                     WT P. aeruginosa, which mainly produces                     di-rhamnolipids. This result confirms that our                     construct is working as expected, yet we need a                     detection method with higher sensitivity.
Supercritical fluid chromatography
In order to accurately measure the amount of                     rhamnolipids produced by our mutant strains, we                     used supercritical fluid chromatography                     (SFC-MS). First, a test run was executed with a                     mixture of mono-rhamnolipids and di-rhamnolipids                     at the concentration of 5 mg/mL by running the                     sample through the column packed with 2-PIC. From                     this test run, we have obtained the retention times of mono-rhamnolipids (rha-C10-C10:                     pseudomolecular ion of 503.56 m/z) and                     di-rhamnolipids (rha-rha-C10-C10: pseudomolecular                     ion of 649.8 m/z) to be approximately 3.974 min                     and 4.942 min respectively. Then, a calibration                     curve was constructed with 95% pure                     mono-rhamnolipids, and the limit of detection was                     found to be approximately 5 µ/mL. The mass                     fractions were obtained from electrospray                     ionization (ESI) negative mode.
From our TLC analysis, it was found that                     supplementing the LB media with glucose is crucial                     to the production of rhamnolipid. Therefore, for                     SFC-MS analysis, all the mutant strains                     (E. Coli_RhlAB, E. Coli_L1_RhlAB, and                     P. putida_L1_RhlAB) were grown in LB supplemented                     with glucose. From the SFC-MS data, it was found                     that mutant E. coli strain makes more                     mono-rhamnolipids than mutant P. putida. Furthermore, the promoter strength was                     confirmed as expected since the mutant E. coli strain transformed with a high expression level                     promoter H2 produced almost 6 times more                     rha-C10-C10.
In order to investigate the optimum growth                     conditions for rhamnolipid by the mutant P. putida strain, the amount of glucose added and the time                     of growth were varied. Using the calibration curve                     above, we were able to measure the accurate amount                     of rhamnolipids produced in each cell                     culture. From this data, we have concluded that P. putida produces the most mono-rhamnolipids when                     grown for 24 hours in the media LB supplemented                     with 50 g/L of glucose.
We have also tested the mutant strain of S. aureus RN4220, the strain that carries shuttle vector for S. epidermidis. Unfortunately, SFC-MS data didn't                     show any production of rhamnolipids from S. aureus strain.
In order to investigate the amount of                     di-rhamnolipids produced, we have tested our                     mutant strains of P. putida transformed with rhlC                     gene. It was grown under the same condition of 24                     hours incubation in LB media supplemented by 50                     g/L of glucose. Approximately 142 µ/mL of                     rha-C10-C10 and 3.524 µ/mL of rha-rha-C10-C10 were detected.
Freeze-drying is a viable method        for P. putida storage
Since our product is designed to be eventually                     applied for every-day use, it therefore must be                     commercially viable, and a key to its commercial                     value is shelf life. Freezing is the usual                     treatment of commercially available products                     containing live bacterial culture; however, the                     associated cost is rather high and would render                     our product uncompetitive relative to existing                     products if freezing were the storage method                     chosen. Exploring other options, we decided to try                     freeze-drying, which is most commonly employed to                     treat bacteria for probiotic products. A huge                     advantage of the method is that freeze-dried                     bacteria can be stored at room temperature, which                     would drastically reduce the storage cost of the                     product and make the product accessible to many                     underdeveloped countries where mosquito-repellent                     is especially needed. The method manipulates                     pressure and temperature conditions so that water                     molecules within the cell undergo sublimation,                     preserving cellular integrity and properties.
Nevertheless, the existing snap-freeze protocols                     are mostly designed for common lab strains such as E. coli, so we experimented with different                     formulations for the lyoprotectant and rehydration                     media to optimize the protocol and to maximize                     post-freeze-dry survival rate for P. putida. Briefly, cells were grown to desired                     turbidity, collected, and washed. Pellets are                     resuspended in lyoprotectant containing 10%                     sucrose w/ LB and stored in -20 °C until                     frozen. Frozen samples are then incubated in                     liquid nitrogen to further reduce the temperature                     and freeze-dried in a lyophilizer for 24                     hours. Samples are subsequently collected, sealed                     with parafilm, and stored in a dessicator. To                     rehydrate, Rehydration media (LB) is added to                     dried samples and the liquid rehydration culture                     is incubated at room temperature for 40 minutes.
To test the relationship between storage time and                     survival rate, we freeze-dried cells from the same                     liquid culture and rehydrated them at different                     time points to observe change in viable cell                     concentration over time. The result is shown in                     Figure.
Additionally, it was found that the survival rate                     for snap-freeze is still much higher than than                     that of freeze-dry; about 72% of P. putida survived after the time point of 28 days. Although                     the survival rate dropped to nearly zero after 28                     days, there is still a considerable amount of                     bacteria left (~104 CFU/ml) that could potentially                     reproduce and secrete rhamnolipid. These results                     could perhaps be improved with more specialized                     lyophilizer since the one we had available was                     mainly for chemical use. Moreover, we could also                     potentially improve the result with a more                     advanced moisture-control method such as air-tight                     sealing.
Discussion
Overall, the team was successful in engineering a                     harmless strain of bacteria that can secrete                     rhamnolipids as a means to prevent mosquito                     bites. Rhamnolipid quantification assays indicated                     that while the construct does produce                     rhamnolipids, the amount must be amplified in                     order to ensure complete protection from                     mosquitoes. Mosquito experiments demonstrated that                     once the concentration is elevated mosquitoes will                     be repelled by the rhamnolipids produced by the                     team's construct.
Regarding safety, rhamnolipid survival assays show                     that Rhamnolipid will not severely affect the                     growth of skin bacteria such as S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Staphylococcus transformation was                     attempted and would have been a more permanent                     solution for Rhamnolipid productions, since S. epidermidis is a natural 70% coloniser of human                     skin. Keratinocytes experiments revealed that                     safety is not a prominent worry as rhamnolipids                     did not significantly cause cell death of healthy                     human skin cells in an acute setting nor did high                     concentration of bacteria cause significant cell                     death. Mouse experiments were planned and will be                     the final stage of safety procedures after                     optimizing rhamnolipid production by the bacteria                     construct.
Several experiments were conducted to assess the                     sustainability of our product or potential                     shelf-life if it is commercialized as a legitimate                     lotion. Freeze-dry versus snap freeze comparisons                     show that snap freeze is more effective at                     maintaining long-term bacterial survival, but                     freeze-dry maintains its position as the more                     practical preservation method given it needs only                     a desiccator as opposed to a -80 °C freezer for                     transport. Consequently, future experiments can be                     done to tweak the protocol and/or lyoprotectant to                     improve survival rates for consistent rhamnolipid                     production levels.
