	    If you were to ask your friend to list the most deadly
	    animals, he or she would probably include lions, tigers,
	    and bears (oh my!).  However, they may be surprised to
	    hear that the mosquito deserves a high place on this list.
	    According to the World Health Organization, mosquitos
	    account for more than one million deaths annually.  These
	    deaths are caused by mosquito-borne illnesses including
	    West Nile virus, elephantiasis, dengue fever, yellow
	    fever, malaria, and more recently Zika.  With the recent
	    outbreak of the Zika virus, the World Health Organization
	    and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have
	    labeled Zika as an international health concern.  With no
	    known treatments or vaccines currently available,
	    prevention is the only option to combat Zika.
	  </P><P>
	    Citronella oil and DEET are the main commercially
	    available repellents against Zika-carrying mosquitos, yet
	    these products possess several shortcomings.  Each
	    repellent stops being effective approximately three hours
	    after application.  However, many users are unaware of
	    this time frame.  Consequently, they are unprepared to
	    reapply and are left unprotected. Applying current
	    mosquito repellent can lead to a false sense of security,
	    which can cause a person to be more prone to mosquito
	    bites.  While citronella oil has a lower efficacy than
	    DEET, DEET has been shown to be harmful to skin, causing
	    painful rashes.  DEET is also harmful to the environment
	    since its chemical runoffs can disrupt neighboring
	    wildlife.  Although DEET and citronella oil are viable
	    mosquito repellents, they are by no means ideal.
	  </P><P>
	    Our project hopes to provide a safe, long-lasting mosquito
	    repellent using the microbiome.  Recent research has shown
	    that the biomolecule di-rhamnolipids, naturally produced
	    by <EM>Pseudomonas aeruginosas</EM>, effectively repels
	    mosquitos at low concentrations.  This biomolecule is
	    safer than DEET and more effective than citronella oil.
	    However, di-rhamnolipids are expensive to produce
	    synthetically. Furthermore, although naturally found on
	    human skin, <EM>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</EM> is known to be
	    pathogenic.  <EM>Pseudomonas putida</EM>, an environmental
	    strain found in soil, survives well on most surfaces, and
	    is non-pathogenic. Using <EM>P. putida</EM>, we are
	    designing a safe bacteria strain to produce
	    rhamnolipids. As a more long-term option, we will also be
	    modifying <EM>Staphylococcus epidermidis</EM>, a natural
	    skin microbe, to produce rhamnolipids. The probiotics
	    would be applied to the skin via a lotion rather than a
	    spray like most repellents to prevent the loss of the
	    product to the environment. These bacteria would
	    continuously produce the mosquito repellent on the skin
	    thereby increasing duration of efficacy as well as cost
	    effectiveness as less repellent would need to be
	    purchased.
	  </P><P>
	    The experimental plan is as follows: building a
	    recombinant plasmid with the genes necessary to produce
	    rhamnolipids, transforming this plasmid
	    into <EM>Pseudomonas putida</EM> and <EM>Staphylococcus
	    epidermidis</EM>, and quantifying the amount of
	    rhamnolipids produced by these engineered
	    strains. Rhamnolipid will be quantified using TLC, CTAB
	    assay, Orcinol Assay, and various spectrometry techniques
	    such as MS, HPLC-MS, and SFC-MS. Additionally, we will do
	    experiments to analyze the effects such biosynthetic
	    repellent will have on mosquitoes. Ultimately, we plan to
	    analyze the effects rhamnolipids have on skin by
	    conducting experiments in mice. Lastly, we hope to conduct
	    experiments that include both mice and mosquitoes to
	    assess to what extent the repellent is effective.
