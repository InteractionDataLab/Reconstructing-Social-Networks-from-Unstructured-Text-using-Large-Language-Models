R1:Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
E1: We have been working on our project since this April and are going to attend the Giant Jamboree.
R2: Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page (section 3), except those that specifically mention parts.
E2: We have designed our wiki and poster; we are going to do presentation on the Giant Jamboree. Since we are software team, we do not handle any biological parts, nor do we submit sample. You can visit our safety forms: About Our Lab About Our Project Final Safety Form
R3: Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
E3: Here is our teamâ€™s attribution page.
R4: Document at least one new substantial contribution to the iGEM community that showcases a project made with BioBricks. This contribution should be equivalent in difficulty to making and submitting a BioBrick part.
E4: One of the major functions of our software is BioBricks or parts recommendation. For more detailed information, you can visit Project/Design page. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the recommendation, we adopted and designed a series of algorithm. For one thing, we combined semantic analysis with Statistics to find sentences and paragraphs which are likely to contain information about gene relationship, for another, we use k-means clustering algorithm to partition articles into several clusters to help biological researchers avoid reading similar papers, enhancing their working efficiency. For more detailed information, you can visit Technology page.
R1: Validate that something you created (art & design, hardware, software, etc) performs its intended function. Provide thorough documentation of this validation on your team wiki.
E1: Unit test and functional test are done to ensure the reliability of our software. We calculated the recall ratio, and invited wet team to use our software.
R2: Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
E2: We analyzed the sequences of OUC-China, helped them characterized an essential component RNase E, with high cutting efficiency. We tested the software developed by USTC-Software, offering them some suggestions and solutions to their bugs. For more detailed information, please visit Collaboration page.
R3: iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
E3: We have done the Human Practice. For more detailed information, please visit Human Practice page.
R1: Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
E1: Our human practice is not limited to the projects of iGEM, we want to demonstrate the current status of synthetic biology assisting software more inclusively. For more detailed information, you can visit Integrated Human Practice page.
R2: Improve the function OR characterization of an existing iGEM project (that your team did not originally create) and display your achievement on your wiki.
E2: We improved the software BioDesigner designed by HFUT-China-2015. For more detailed information, you can visit Description page.
R3: Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project.
E3: To prove the utility and reliability of literature analysis, we invited wet team to test our software and calculated the recall ratio. You can see their feedbacks and calculation results at Validation page.
R4: Bring your prototype or other work to the Giant Jamboree and demonstrate it to iGEMers and judges in your track showcase
E4: You can visit your software at http://www.webonline.site/ Register for an account and enjoy your design!
