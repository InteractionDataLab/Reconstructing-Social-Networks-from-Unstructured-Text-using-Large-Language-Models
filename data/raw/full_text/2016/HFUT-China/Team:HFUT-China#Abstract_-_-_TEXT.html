    For biologists, it is quite frustrating to find suitable BioBricks and collect useful genetic information in large volumes of literature. Now with BioDesigner Coral, biologists can search BioBricks, design with the help of recommendations and obtain genetic information of BioBricks in a more comprehensive way. It can analyze user’s design, then give recommendations about parts they may need. Through analysis of massive literature, we find useful information about genes, BioBricks, and the relations between genes. All genetic information will be exhibited in a network graph through visualization method to help users understand and use them better. Clicking on the nodes in the network, which represent genes or BioBricks, users can obtain relatively accurate information about related genes, corresponding protein, and relevant literature. We hope BioDesigner Coral can relieve the arduous work in labs and give inspirations to synthetic biologists.
