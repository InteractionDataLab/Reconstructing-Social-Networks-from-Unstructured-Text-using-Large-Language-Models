2. Function:
Facts from official website:
iGEM software developers should work closely with experimental synthetic biologists and iGEM teams to build tools that are genuinely useful to the synthetic biology and iGEM communities. Software tools could directly help synthetic biologists in the lab, at their desktops, or even in how they communicate with each other and access information. You may wish to build a tool that:
Improves design, assembly and testing of biological circuits
Makes bioengineering more predictive
Helps biologists discover parts and exchange information about them
Improves parts registry navigation
Helps the iGEM communities communicate with one another / identify problems
Serve as a better biobrick database API
Parses information from one form to another
3. Validation:
Before their wiki was freeze, 29 teams have tested their software in wet labs.
