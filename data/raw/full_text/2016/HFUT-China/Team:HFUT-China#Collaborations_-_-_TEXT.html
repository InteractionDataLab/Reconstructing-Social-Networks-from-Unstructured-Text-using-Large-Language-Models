In the information era, it is almost impossible to achieve success through oneâ€™s personal e- ffort, and synthetic biology is without excepti- on. To make our software better meet the re- quirement of synthetic biologists, we collabo- rate with OCU-China, as well as BroadRun- Baltimore.
The team members in OCU-China told us their most frequently-used synthetic biolo- gy assisting software, including Primer P- remier 5, SnapGene, MEGA6, etc. Based on their feedback, we analyze the advan- tage and disadvantage of these public or commercial software to improve our user interface design. BroadRun-Baltimore is a high school team from the US, whose student leader, Maris- sa, has a lot of experience in the presenta- tion of science research.
