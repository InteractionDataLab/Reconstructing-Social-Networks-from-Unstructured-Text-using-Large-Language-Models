This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. </TD><TD> E3: Here is our teamâ€™s <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:HFUT-China/Attributions">attribution</A> page. </TD></TR><TR><TD> R4: Document at least one new substantial contribution to the iGEM community that showcases a project made with BioBricks. This contribution should be equivalent in difficulty to making and submitting a BioBrick part. </TD><TD> E4: One of the major functions of our software is BioBricks or parts recommendation. For more detailed information, you can visit Project/Design page. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the recommendation, we adopted and designed a series of algorithm. For one thing, we combined semantic analysis with Statistics to find sentences and paragraphs which are likely to contain information about gene relationship, for another, we use k-means clustering algorithm to partition articles into several clusters to help biological researchers avoid reading similar papers, enhancing their working efficiency.
