    In the information world, it is not hard to think that computational work and software development has become a very important part of Synthetic Biology. Up until now, there have been over fifty software track teams, some of which made fabulous achievements.
    However, all teams are judged separately, so there is little information about the comparisons between teams. When picking their projects, green hands in iGEM often find it is hard to find enough reference of previous projects, other than the examples given by the official website. After knowing that the software committee is working to put together a list of projects from previous years along a buildup of why they were successful, we realized that we can do something to bring benefits to the whole software track.
    So we made a software review, which contains three parts: classification of the functions of all the previous software, sparking features of software, and generalization and conclusion of the projects.

What’s more, our human practice is not limited to the projects of iGEM, we did an investigation in a small scale to demonstrate the current status of synthetic biology assisting software more inclusively. You can visit the content at: Integrated Human Practice
