Integrated Human Practice
With the help of search function, users can have a clearer conception, or deeper understanding of their design. Users can type in keywords in the searching box, then parts or compounds, some of which the users might be interested with, will be listed. The basic information, quality evaluation score and related registry page of them will also be exhibited.
For users who are interested in specific genes, to obtain more information, they do not have to scrutinize literatures in the online database on by one. Just input the name of that gene in the searching box, apart from the detailed information, users can see literatures and related diseases of that gene. We also provide corresponding links of these literatures, so users can read them on ncbi.
Recommendation function aims at recommending what the users might use in their design. Along with search function, the design process will become more efficient.
With Aprior and Markov algorithm, the program can find all the parts that are related to the parts in usersâ€™ bological parts chain design. When users design their devices, the software can recommend parts that may appear after the last part, in the middle of the last two parts, and in front of the last part of their biological parts chain design.
Besides, BioDesigner Coral provides another kind of recommendation. With the analysis of pathway data, we find proteins, compounds and genes which are related to each other. Type in keywords, click on those proteins, compounds or genes, the relationship is shown in a map, which helps users discover new information, thus get inspirations.
We analyze literatures in the online database, trying to find relationships between genes. The relationship is shown through visualization, which means users can see the related genes in a direct way.
Click on the circle that represents a gene, users can see its detailed information, as well as literatures that contain information about that gene. Click on the line between two genes, users can see the sentences (coming from literatures) that exhibit how the two genes are related.
To enhance the efficiency of reading, we categorize literatures into several groups, which means users can read them selectively, according to their needs. Users can see the abstract and key words of each literature; if they want to further study that literature, they can visit the original text on ncbi. Similarly, users can also see information about the diseases related to the genes, and have access to literatures about the diseases.
