Demonstration
After validating our biological devices, to demonstrate the feasibility of establishing an AR system for bio-pattern formation, we constructed an industrial level device which can create a virtual space overlapping with a real environment (a LB culture plate, here). It can mislead the bacteria to form an heterogeneous pattern on a homogeneous swimming plate.               To know more about our device, please watch the following video.
Highlights:
1. Huge bulk.
2. Sterilizing function.
3. Real-time picture capturing.
4. Precise light projecting.
5. Temperature measuring and controlling.
6. Real-time communication between computer and bacteria.
We shot a video to show the device working in our real world!
