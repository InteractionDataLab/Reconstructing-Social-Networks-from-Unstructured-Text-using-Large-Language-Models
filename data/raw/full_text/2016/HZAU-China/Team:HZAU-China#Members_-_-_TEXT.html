Instructors
Binguang Ma
Prof. Ma is our direct instructor. He has seen us through thick and thin, and has been with us in times of happiness and sorrow. His field of research is systems biology and synthetic biology, and this time, the inspiration of our project is from him. We all love him, for he is not only our instructor, but also our friends.
Donghai Peng
Prof. Peng has been one of our greatest supporters ever since our first yearâ€™s iGEM, and continues to be of tremendous help to us by offering all kinds of suggestions and lending us all kinds of experimental materials.
