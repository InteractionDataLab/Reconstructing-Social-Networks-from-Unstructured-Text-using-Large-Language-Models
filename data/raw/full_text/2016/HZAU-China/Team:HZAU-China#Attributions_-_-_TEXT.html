Acknowledgement:
For each parts of experiments, our appreciations are as follow:
Gene knock out
Thanks to Dr. Youming Zhang’s laboratory, Shandong University, for sharing the material and instruction on method.
Riboswitch
Thanks to Professor Jin He’s lab, Huazhong Agricultural University, for sharing the material (Gene: pleD, tandem riboswitch; Plasmid: pETb ) and special thanks to Dr. Xinfeng Li, for his proposal of gene circuit assembly.
The paper (Characterization of a natural tripletandem c-di-GMP riboswitch and application of the riboswitch-based dual-fluorescence reporter ) provides the experiment design idea.
Motility
Thanks to Dr. Chenli Liu from SIAT CSynBER enerous share(Strain: Escherichia coli MG1655, CL-1), our experiment can process successfully.
We really appreciate your support!
