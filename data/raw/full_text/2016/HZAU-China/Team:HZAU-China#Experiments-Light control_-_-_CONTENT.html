However, it is a tough decision on which strain to choose as the chassis of our project. At first we have two options, one is to choose CL1, a strain lacks motility-related gene cheZ but has envZ which is functionally equivalent to CcaS. The other is to choose JT2, optogenetically optimized but possesses cheZ. Therefore, to better achieve our goal on making the whole project work, we are determined to enforce gene knockout with λ Red recombination system, either to knockout envZ in CL1, or to knockout cheZ in JT2. However, swarming assay shows that been JT2 has been traumatized in previous research and show no motility (swarming ability even lower than CL1, data not shown). Consequently, deletion of envZ in CL1 strain is the optimized design.</P><H3>2.Material and Method</H3><H4>2.1 Material</H4><P>1.Kits: TIANprep Mini Plasmid Kit (TIANGEN), QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN), E.Z.N.A Plasmid DNA Mini Kit (OMEGA), AxyPrepTM  PCR Cleanup Kit (AXYGEN)</P><P>2.Enzymes: Four standard restriction enzymes:EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI (TAKARA).

Result</H3><H4>3.1 PCB Optimization in CcaS-CcaR System</H4><P>As previously described, we removed the redundant ccaS in pSR43.6. Quantitative measurement on sfGFP fluorescence was operated in the purpose of certifying the feasibility of the removal, a premise for constructing plasmid PCB-J23117-BC345-cheZ and PCB-J23117-BC345-cheZ in our ultimate genetic circuit. Under green-light illumination, JT2 with PCB (△ccaS) and CcaS-CcaR encoding plasmid pJTb119 occured to be green which can be recognized by naked eye after centrifugation (Figure 2.a). This qualitatively demonstrates that the light-switchable system is available without the redundant ccaS in pSR43.6. Moreover, quantitative measurement result on sfGFP fluorescence depicts that in E.coli strain JT2 CcaS-CcaR system produces 266.0 ± 19.3 and 509.0 ± 55.4 au of sfGFP in red and green light, corresponding to 1.91 ± 0.34-fold activation, illustrating that PcpcG2 is functionally regulated by light, green-activated and red-repressed (Figure 2.b). And bacteria without redundant ccaS shows significantly higher dynamic, indicating that the optimization is effective. We suspect that the exceeding expression level of CcaS has great impact on the metabolic pathway of bacteria.</P><P style="text-align:center">Figure 2.Measurement on sfGFP fluorescence in PCB optimization.</P><P> a. Green-light activated JT2 with PCB (△ccaS) and pJTb119 centrifugation. b. Fluorescence assay of primitive PCB and PCB (△CcaS) in JT2.</P><H4>3.2 Optimization on Chassis Strain</H4><P>To better integrate the three devices, light-switchable TCS, riboswitch device, and motility device, it is inevitable to achieve co-expression in CL1 E.coli strain, cheZ deleted mutant strain. Optimization on chassis strain has been accomplished as we created SBSP strain (CL1 △EnvZ)(see “<A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/Experiments-chassis_integration">chassis integration</A>”). Quantitative fluorescence measurement on CcaS-CcaR system in different strains JT2, CL1 and SBSP allude that the differences in fluorescence value under green and red light are approximately the same in three strains, although JT2 has higher expression efficiency (Figure 3). So it is plausible to transform the CcaS-CcaR system into CL1 (△EnvZ) for experiment on motility. </P><P style="text-align:center">Figure 3. Fluorescence assay in different chassis strain B,C,D. All three strains have co-expression of both two plasmids, PCB (△ccaS) and pJTb119.</P><H4>3.3 Optimization on PcpcG2</H4><P>Although CcaS-CcaR light-switchable system has shown excellent difference responding to green and red light, leakiness still exist and will be a huge problem when this device is applied for motility control. Therefore, optimization on green-light activated promoter PcpcG2 was executed. In bacteria strain D and E, containing PcpcG2 before and after truncation respectively, E seems to be less green than D when cultured in dark condition (Figure 4a). This is an indication of reduction in leakiness when constitutive promoter is eliminated. Fluorescence assays also infer that leaked expression in darkness significantly reduced after truncation of the constitutive promoter. (Figure 4b) By the way, the difference of fluorescence under green and red light is narrowed unexpectedly. We suspect it is due to the limited precision in cultural environment that the simple constructed detecting device v1.0 provides. For example, wavelength, light intensity, and uniformity in each centrifugal tube. These factors could be the reason to measurement mistakes.</P><P style="text-align:center">Figure 4.
