Medal Criteria
Here, we want to summarize how we fulfilled the criteria required to win medals in the iGEM competition in the course of our project.
Bronze (4/4)
Silver (3/3)
Gold (3/4)
Bronze (4/4)
Register & Attend
We successfully registered for the competition and are very excited to finally fly to Boston for the Giant Jamboree.
Deliverables: (8/8)
Team wiki
As you can see here, we were able to create an awesome wiki to proudly present our results.
Poster
We would like to invite everyone to come to our booth and check out our poster.
Presentation
We will give a presentation about our whole project at the Giant Jamboree.
Project attribution
All of the work done for our project has been attributed properly.
Registry part pages
To document the parts that we created in the course of our project, we prepared pages on the Registry which should help everyone to use our parts in the most efficient way.
Sample submission
The DNA of our new parts is submitted to the Registry.
Safety forms
All safety forms were completed with great care.
Judging form
We completed the judging form to help judges evaluate us for prizes and awards.
Attribution
On our attribution page you can find a detailed description of who contributed to our project and how.
Part / Contribution
To our great satisfaction, we successfully documented multiple new standard BioBrick parts central to our project and submitted them to the Registry.
Silver (3/3)
Validated Part/Contribution
In addition to the creation of new standard BioBrick parts, we also experimentally validated the functionality of one of our parts and documented its characterization in the Registry.

Collaboration
We gladly worked together with other teams to establish a mutual connection that would benefit both of our projects.
Human Practices
To examine our project from a different angle, we identified, investigated, and addressed important issues outside of the lab.
Gold (3/4)
Integrated Human Practices
In due consideration of the results of our human practice work, we improved the final design of our project.
Improvement of a previous part or project
We continued the work of the iGEM team Texas Austin 2014 and improved their measurement kit to determine the incorporation-efficiency of a tRNA-synthetases-pair. We successfully used the improved kit in the course of our project and made it available for everyone by submitting it to the Registry in the BioBrick standard.

Proof of concept
With one of our newly created BioBricks, we were able to prove that the principle of our project is functional.
