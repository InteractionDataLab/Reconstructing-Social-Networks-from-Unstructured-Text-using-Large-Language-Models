Advisors
This section we want to dedicate to our advisors. As most of our team members are still bachelor students and had no or only minor knowledge about actually working in a lab before getting in touch with iGEM, our advisors played an important role in starting our project. They guided us in the long process of shaping our abstract ideas into real, scientific strategies and are the reason why we can now proudly announce that we are able to organize and execute our own experiments. Here, we want to present how each of them supported our project.

Supervisors
Alongside with our advisors we also owe special thanks to our supervisors. In 2016, RWTH Aachen University has had its third iGEM team and this would have never been possible without reliable faculty members who promote the iGEM spirit. They enabled us to work on our idea by providing us with their expertise as well as resources and lab-space. We are very grateful for their support and look forward to another successful synergy between our experienced supervisors and a new iGEM team that is bubbling over with ideas in 2017.
