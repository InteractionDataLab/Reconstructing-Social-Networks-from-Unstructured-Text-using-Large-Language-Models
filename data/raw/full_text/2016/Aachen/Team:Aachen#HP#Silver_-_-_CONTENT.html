Our team visited many different schools in and close to Aachen. To give the pupils a better insight in the field of synthetic biology, we prepared project days in cooperation with the teachers. Our overall goal was to give them an understanding of synthetic biology and microbiology and introduce iGEM to them.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P align="justify" style="padding-left: 1.0cm; padding-right: 1.0cm; font-size:16px;">We gave a presentation about synthetic biology, our project and the iGEM competition in general and afterwards gave a safety instruction and performed some experiments with them.

After the experiments and the dialogue with the students we spend some time with the teachers to reflect on our visit. While talking to them we discovered the lack of possibilities for them to perform biological experiments in schools. To meet those needs, we created a collection of easy to understand experiments that do not require any specific equipment.</P></TD><TD style="width:200px;"><FIGCAPTION style="position:relative;top:10px; font-size:12px; "><B>Figure 2: Two team members at &quot;St. Ursula&quot; school, Monschau.</B></FIGCAPTION></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P align="justify" style="font-size:16px; padding-left : 1cm; padding-right:1cm; margin-bottom:0px;"><B style="color:#005C04 ">Book of experiments </B> (To view the pdf-file, please click <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2016/b/b9/T--Aachen--Experimentesammlung_fuer_Lehrer_safety_external_wiki.pdf" style="color: #0000EE;"><U>here</U></A>)</P><P align="justify" style="font-size:16px; padding-left : 1cm; padding-right:1cm;"><B style="color:#005C04 "> Monschau </B>
We visited a girl’s school in Monschau on two days. First, we talked to several teachers to plan and prepare our visit. We benefit from the teacher’s hints about which topics might be interesting for the students. It was a great pedagogical experience for us, as we had to think of a way how to explain the biological topics to students who do not have a huge biological knowledge.
We thought a lot about it and in the end, it was a great success. We could evoke curiosity and the girls asked a lot of questions about Synthetic Biology and iGEM.<B style="color:#005C04 "> Aachen</B>
Moreover, we visited the <I> St. Ursula </I> Gymnasium in Aachen and presented our work to students who already had a good biological background through their school. We created a new presentation for this purpose and experiments adjusted to their level of knowledge. It turned out that many students were interested in choosing a biology-related topic as their study field. This led us to explaining more about our university and talking about different subjects which are interesting for example Synthetic Biology. Later, we had a lively talk with the teachers who gave us some feedback and discussed the role of genetic engineering in Germany. <B style="color:#005C04 ">Düsseldorf</B>
In Düsseldorf, in cooperation with two different schools, we organized a whole “Biotech-Day”. It was an and challenging experience for us because there were 89 students for whom we needed to do a lot of preparation. But luckily, with the help of the teachers we managed to plan the day. We did not only present the theoretical background of our project, but also put emphasis on safety aspects related to synthetic biology and the experiments. Hence, we were able to initiate interesting conversations and discussed both, our project idea and the practical work in the lab.
As we prepared some long term experiments, we visited the school again after 2 days and could show the results to them. On that day, they took the chance to ask more specific questions about about Synthetic Biology and our field of study. What looked like an overwhelming organizational challenge turned out to be a great experience with students not much younger than us.

&quot;What does <B>synthetic biology</B> even mean?
The term “genetic engineering” is often mentioned in critical media reports and in this context cheese manufacturers more and more advertise with the promise that their products were made without this allegedly dangerous technology. We, as students of this field, would like to give you a better understanding of synthetic biology with the following example:
Nowadays, you can find the declaration “without gene technology” on cheese packages. This does not refer to the actual ingredients of the product, but to the production method, so the cheese itself does not differ from “normal” one. Synthetic biology makes it possible to generate products with the help of genetically engineered microorganisms. In contrast, cheese without genetic engineering is produced with dried calf stomachs, which raises the question if this is more desirable.”

“Jugend forscht” is a European science and technology competition for pupils, with more than 10,000 participants annually. The pupils work on a self-chosen project and present their results at regional levels and later at a national contest to an expert jury. Some winners of this competition were invited to Aachen and visited different scientific places. We organized a presentation and a tour through the laboratory for them. It was inspiring to see, what an immense interested and advanced knowledge about science they have already have. 
After the presentation, we had a chance to talk about our project and the iGEM competition.
It was amazing to be able to enthuse these promising young people further for synthetic biology.

In the German society knowledge about synthetic biology is not very widespread: we found out that the possibilities for people to inform themselves about synthetic biology are very limited which causes a mostly negative attitude towards this subject. Many are sceptical and focused more on the dangers than the possibilities. That’s why we wanted to give especially young people an exciting opportunity to get in touch with synthetic biology via a writing and arts competition - submissions of all group of ages were welcomed. Participants were encouraged to deal with aspects of synthetic biology in a creative way and express how they feel about it. Combining their great ideas with this topic led to amazing stories, which built a bridge between the scientific society and open minded people who were inspired to create their own opinion about synthetic biology.

The winner in our iGEM writing competition 2016 was Hannah Lanzrath with her story titled “14. Oktober 2044”.

Many iGEM teams create great ideas and great projects, but when it comes to the implementation and application in real life, it is also important to deal with the following questions: Would this project be applicable in reality? Would there be a market for this product? What opportunities are there to make the product more appealing to consumers? Apart from &quot;Integrated Practices&quot;, it was also of great interest for us to examine the potential of our idea on the laundry detergents market.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P align="justify" style="padding-left: 1.0cm; padding-right: 1.0cm; font-size:16px;">
That is why we created an <B>economical analysis</B> in cooperation with a business administration student from the University in Nantes, France.
</P><P align="justify" style="font-size:16px; padding-left:0.7cm; padding-right:0.7cm; position:relative;top:-50px; left:00px;"><B style="color:#005c04">Politics of the new product</B>
The iGEM team Aachen wants to produce the photocaged Subtilisin E and the organisms, which can produce the new enzymes. So they are in direct competition to companies like Novozymes or Roche, which offer enzymes for different applications. Until now they only produce in a very small scale. Maybe they can work together with other enzyme producing companies or directly with washing companies. It would definitely be necessary to have an industrial partner to benefit from their experiences on the global market, because the German laundry detergent market is too competitive and controlled by a few corporations.
</P><P align="justify" style="font-size:16px; padding-right:0.7cm; "><B style="color:#005c04">Politic regarding the distribution of the new product</B>
The distribution of the new product depends on the way the iGEM Team Aachen wants to introduce the new product on the market. On the one hand they can try to industrialize it with the help of already existing enzyme companies. One the other hand their product could be applied in the washing industry and used for washing detergents. That’s the most probable application of their protease. With the help of these already existing companies it is possible to distribute their product. For example it could be sold in local supermarkets and drugstores. Probably it won´t be sold in low budget supermarkets, because of the production and developmental costs. Moreover, the iGEM Team Aachen has to care about the distribution of their light tool. Maybe they can include it as a free give-away to the first bottle of washing detergent and start in this way promoting the use of its product.
</P><P align="justify" style="padding-left: 1.0cm; padding-right: 1.0cm; font-size:16px;"><B style="color:#005c04">Politics of communication of the new product </B>
The new product of the iGEM Team Aachen should be communicated as an alternative to already existing washing detergents and there should be a focus on the ecological impacts of boric acid. The product of the iGEM Team Aachen should ban boric acid and make it possible to use the washing detergents with the same quality as before.  Instead of boric acid they want to communicate the use of light to activate the protease. As the iGEM Team wants people to activate the protease with light, they also have to communicate this difference. That’s where I see the biggest problem for the iGEM Team Aachen. They have to convince the people that they should not only invest more time in the washing process, but also to change their customs when it comes to cleaning their clothes. Moreover they would need to convince big companies.  Although the iGEM Team invented a gadget for activating the protease and in a survey the team performed the majority of the people said that they would spend more time for activating the protease, this idea has to be transferred in the daily life of the customers. For that reason this device has to be as user friendly as possible, the application should only differ in a very small way from today’s application and the price should be in the same range like before. If they take care of these purposes and still maintain the ecological part, the products can have a chance on the global market

For our members it was a great experience to participate, because they had the opportunity to get in touch with other iGEM teams, learn something about the different projects and establish a personal contact with other members. Moreover, they had the chance to include the expertise and suggestions from other teams in the planning process of our project. But of course we also had a lot of fun in this amazing city. In this context we want to thank once again the iGEM Teams in Paris for their invitation.</P></TD><TD width="300px;"><FIGCAPTION style="position:relative;top:10px; left:-10px; font-size:15px; text-align: center;"><B>Figure 5: iGEM team gathering</B></FIGCAPTION></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2 style="border-bottom: 5px solid #005b04;padding-left: 1.0cm;">German iGEM Meet up</H2><TABLE style="border-collapse:separate;border:0px;border-spacing:-30px;margin-top:-0px;width: 920px;table-layout:fixed;"><TBODY><TR><TD width="300px;"><FIGCAPTION style="position:relative;top:0px; left:20px; font-size:15px; text-align: center;"><B>Figure  5:  Members of our team playing bubble soccer at the German iGEM Meetup </B></FIGCAPTION></TD><TD><P align="justify" style="font-size:16px; padding-right:1cm; padding-left:1cm; position:relative;top:-40px; ">
All German teams came together at this Meet up in Marburg. iGEM Marburg organized a tour through their town and for the scientific exchange, they invited local scientists, industry representatives, and of course Traci from iGEM headquarters to give talks. Moreover, we had the opportunity to present our project ideas in front of all the other teams. 
It was a lot of fun and after the weekend we went home tired but happy.

Until now we did not look at the ethical perspective of our project. After our conversations with the public and some other professors it is not surprising, that synthetic biology, which adapts and designs living organisms with many different applications, has a broad ethical dimension. An ethical dimension, an ethical discussion … ethical questions … ethics? 
Many of us maybe heard about ethics, because of their philosophy courses or because of their religious education at school. Some of us maybe saw an ethic expert in television or in some TV discussion rounds. But what is ethic exactly? 

Ethic is a branch of philosophy and refers to well-founded standards of right and wrong. Normally it defines what humans ought to do and what is wrong about their actions. Ethics is about trying to give answers to questions about how we have to react to or act in specific situations, what we have to consider to develop a well- founded decision or what is wrong about the way we handle different topics. 

As we do not know so many aspects related to ethics and because of our non-objective perspective, we started to contact different experts in Germany. The pdf-file of one of the interviews can be found below.

In essence, it is a very good training for students to learn how to take over responsibilities and to work in and as a team. I strongly support the participation of students in the iGEM competition and it is great if they have the chance to travel to Boston and present their concept at the Giant Jamboree. There they will be exposed to other brilliant students all over the world which share common interests. Apart from this, the iGEM competition has a very positive role in terms of visibility for the nature science faculty of the RWTH Aachen University and even generated interest from companies.</I><B style="color:#005c04">How do You think: Can iGEM support the education of the students? </B><I>I would say that iGEM also has a very positive influence and shapes their personality to become leaders in research. Members of the iGEM team will get a totally different insight of lab work and research by developing own ideas and experience how challenging the realization on the molecular level can be. However, taking and learning from these frustrations enables students to grow by discovering and analyzing challenges as well as finally solving them totally on their own. The letter fosters their believes in own abilities and strengthens their personality and leadership skills to tackle important scientific questions in the future. </I><B style="color:#005c04">What makes iGEM special in comparison to other student programs and practical courses? </B><I>I think the most important part of iGEM is the aspect of self-organization in terms of selected topics and fundraising to support iGEM activities. The latter experiences makes iGEM outstanding and much more challenging than other student activities and internships in which research topics are usually provided by the supervisor.</I><B style="color:#005c04">How do You evaluate the complexity of the iGEM competition (financial support, organisation, and public relations)?</B><I>iGEM teams have more or less to act like a biotech start up company which has to develop and to market their own development to finance their challenging activities and thereby establishing their organization, public relations and fundraising. The complexity of the iGEM competition and the limited time for idea development makes iGEM a highly complex and challenging endeavor.</I><B style="color:#005c04">What do You think about this years iGEM team Aachen and its project ideas?</B><I>In one word: <B>GREAT</B>. Light switchable proteins are a very <B>promising and challenging topic in biotechnology</B> and in material science and will emerge in the future as a hot topic in national research agenda on bioeconomy in Germany. </I><B style="color:#005c04">Please name three terms that describe the iGEM teams in Aachen and their work?</B><I>The three terms that come directly to my mind to describe RWTH’s iGEM team Aachen are  <B>“international”</B>, <B>”interdisciplinary”</B> and <B>” innovative”</B> (triple i work).</I><B style="color:#005c04">Could You please tell us something about the previous work of the iGEM teams in Aachen?</B><I>The past two iGEM teams from Aachen were <B>SENSATIONAL</B>. They won several gold medals and awards as best newcomers. I am very proud of our students!</I><B style="color:#005c04">How do You feel to be a part of the iGEM team Aachen 2016?</B><I>It is fun to discuss with them and it is my pleasure to support these excellent young scientists with experience/infrastructure and to see them to grow with their challenges and success. </I></P></DIV><DIV class="text-overflow1" style="margin-bottom:-10px;"><H2 style="border-bottom: 5px solid #005b04;padding-left: 1.0cm;">Interview with Our Supervisor Prof. Blank</H2><P align="justify" style="padding-left: 1.0cm; padding-right: 1.0cm; font-size:16px;"><B style="color:#005c04">How do You evaluate the iGEM competition in general and the influence which the former iGEM teams from Aachen had? </B><I>The iGEM competition allows <B>self-organized research</B>. The aspect of bringing engineering into biology is fitting very well to the RWTH Aachen University and the Jülich Research Center. The three teams competing as the iGEM teams Aachen paved the way for synthetic biology at RWTH Aachen.</I><B style="color:#005c04">How do You think: Can iGEM support the education of the students?</B><I>iGEM can support the education because the students work self-motivated. Moreover the concept of research-based teaching intensifies the teaching experience. That the newest synthetic biology technologies can be applied is lifting the teaching in Aachen on a different level.. After their iGEM time many members have accelerate expertise and working skills. For sure, the softskills were practiced, working in a group of about 15 people. Students have the chance to develop new skills, new management experiences and to work with new devices. </I><B style="color:#005c04">What makes iGEM special in comparison to other student programs and practical courses? </B><I>A huge difference is that students have the chance to work on their own. Moreover, they have the chance to develop a project on their own and work on it till the end of the competition. Furthermore the students can get in touch with local companies and learn how to ask for financial supports for their project. Especially in Aachen, the topic is chosen by the students hence the students have the chance to integrate project ideas, in which they are really interested. Students have the chance to learn everything on their own and make special experiences, which they could not get from other student initiatives or other practical courses. These differences make iGEM clearly a unique experience. </I><B style="color:#005c04">How do You evaluate the complexity of the iGEM competition (financial support, organisation, and public relations)?</B><I>Again very positive. Students have the chance to integrate their different interests and talents into the competition and into the project. Moreover it is great that students can work several months together on the same topic and work with students who are interested in very different subjects. Additionally, this is a good practice for their professional life.
Attracting funds and raising public awareness for the project is central to iGEM. Without the initiative of the students the presence of iGEM in Aachen and the special iGEM spirit would not be the same. The RWTH Aachen University and the FZJ support the iGEM team every year. The supporters of the iGEM team think that the “Bottom up” strategy, i.e., students first, fits best to Aachen. Because the students have the chance to develop their <B>OWN project</B>, obviously with support from the experts and institutes.</I><B style="color:#005c04">What do You think about this year’s iGEM team Aachen and its project ideas?</B><I><B>Super, you can talk about the topic with many different people, who are unfamiliar with synthetic biology and biotechnology</B>. Everybody uses liquid washing detergents because of the absence of dusts and allergenic substances. Moreover, it is possible to explain the environmental problem caused by boric acid to the public and still present a very interesting topic in the field of synthetic biology. Photocaging is still a very new and innovative strategy to work with. So it is possible to break down the topic of synthetic biology into a problematic aspect of our daily life. <B>Do the test: can you explain the project to your family in a few sentences? I think you can do this.</B></I><B style="color:#005c04">

Assuming that both boric acid and the photo cleavage degradation product have similar toxicities the project approach has a clear advantage because of the much lower concentration in the product. While there are 16 mmol boric acid per kg laundry detergent the concentration of the photocaged amino acid is only 3,6 nmoles per kg. For every photocaged molecule of amino acid one molecule of protection group exits.

The common liquid laundry detergent contains 0.5 - 1% (w/w) of boric acid and 0.00005 - 0.0001% (w/w) active protease. [<A href="#ref11safety"><U style="color:#0000EE; ">11</U></A>] <BIG><B style="color:#005b04;">Molecules of subtilisin in 100 g of liquid laundry detergent</B></BIG>

If the toxicity of cleavage products is less than 448,000 fold higher than the toxicity of boric acid, washing detergents with replaced boric acid were less toxic than the actual. <BIG><B style="color:#005b04;">Example for one washing cycle (100 g liquid laundry detergent)</B></BIG>
For this calculation we assume that 1% of the liquid detergent stays in the laundry after washing and the composition is like in the calculation above. <BIG><B style="color:#005b04;">DMNB and ONB group</B></BIG>

Boric acid is highly water soluble and can be neither eliminated in the waste water treatment plant nor in the drinking water purification plant. [<A href="#ref13safety"><U style="color:#0000EE; ">13</U></A>] 

The LIPs products are organic products, which could be eliminated by a biological waste water treatment plant but this remains to be verified as there is no related data available. As organic compounds they could most likely be filtered by active charcoal and others whereby human exposure by the drinking water can be excluded. Also, organic compounds will likely be degraded over time.</P><DIV class="single_header_title"><H1 style="padding-left: 0.8cm;">Laboratory Satefy Aspects</H1></DIV><H2 style="border-bottom: 5px solid #005b04;padding-left: 1.0cm;">Used organism strains</H2><P align="justify" style="padding-left:1.0cm; padding-right:1.0cm; font-size: 16px;"><OL style=" list-style-type: disc; padding-left:1.5cm; padding-right:1.5cm;  align-content: center"><LI><SPAN><I>Escherichia coli</I> DH5α</SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN><I>Escherichia coli</I> BL21 DE3</SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN><I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I></SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN><I>Bacillus subtilis</I></SPAN></LI></OL></P><H2 style="border-bottom: 5px solid #005b04;padding-left: 1.0cm;">Potential risks</H2><P align="justify" style="padding-left:1.0cm; padding-right:1.0cm; font-size: 16px;">
