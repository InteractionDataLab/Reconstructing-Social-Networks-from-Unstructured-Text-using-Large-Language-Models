Throughout our project we received much support and help from many people. Firstly we’d like to thank Dr Badge and Professor Dalgleish for offering us the opportunity to participate in iGEM and for helping us get to the Giant Jamboree in Boston. We would also like to thank Liam Crawford for being our advisor and helping us get started in the lab and with our project.
