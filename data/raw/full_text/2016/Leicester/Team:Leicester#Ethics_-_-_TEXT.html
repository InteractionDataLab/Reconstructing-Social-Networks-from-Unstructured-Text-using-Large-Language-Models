(Calcitonin Hyper Expression using E.Coli in Space Exploration)
While doing our research, we needed to address some bioethical questions. To start with, we would hope that the ultimate application of this research would be to edit within an actual human’s genome. In brief, instead of the requirement for patients to source calcitonin from our mutant calcitonin-producing E.coli, we surpass this step entirely and allow them to upregulate their calcitonin production endogenously (i.e. within the body). Concerns that may arise could be linked to off-target effects but we would hope that if the research gets as far as this, by using tissue-specific promoters (specific to bone) and other specificity-conferring mechanisms that we can minimise this risk. Additionally, it must be taken into account that no medical intervention exists without risk and for advancement to occur such risks must be taken.
Furthermore, within our project we must consider that by producing any genetically modified organisms (GMO), there is a risk of release into the environment and any possible negative implications associated with this. However, E.coli can be easily contained and we have prepared a document of measures which provide guidelines that we will be following outlining procedure on handling microorganisms. This document is available upon request and will ensure safety and risk minimisation of GMO release into the environment during the course of our project.
A final ethical consideration is that once astronauts have returned to Earth there must be a means to return the calcitonin to normally expressed levels (i.e. to reverse the effects of upregulation). This is imperative as too high calcitonin levels have been linked to cancer. One potential way of achieving this could be through provision of an RNA sequence (in excess) complementary to the gRNA in order to form a duplex with the gRNA and interrupt its interaction with the target sequence and hence freeing this region.
