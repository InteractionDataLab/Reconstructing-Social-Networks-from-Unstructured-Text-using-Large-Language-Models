1. Presentation in Junior high school
We went to Zhong Jia bilingual high school to promote our project and the knowledge about synthetic biology.
2 Presentation in Senior high school
We also went to NO.1 senior high school in DangTu County in Ma’anShan, where we received a warm welcome while sharing our project. As the high school students have learned the genetic engineering in biology class, they showed a great interest in our project and bombarded us with a lot of questions. In the later half of our promotion, we gave a brief introduction of iGEM competition and the knowledge about synthetic biology.
3 Connecting to the freshmen
During the military training of freshmen, we publicized our project of 2016 and asked them to follow us on Wechat and fill our questionnaires. When we introduced our project and iGEM competition, they were very interested in what we said. They eagerly joined in our QQ group for 2017 AHUT_iGEM team and were very active interacting with one another.Through our concerted efforts, more and more people are getting to know iGEM competition and becoming more interested in synthetic biology.
