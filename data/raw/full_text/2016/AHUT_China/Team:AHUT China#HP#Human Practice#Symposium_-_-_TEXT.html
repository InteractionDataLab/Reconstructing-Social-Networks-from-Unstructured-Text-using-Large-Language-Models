1. Communicating with experts
In order to determine the focus of iGEM 2016, we decided to present our project to the professionals with experience in research. So with this spirit, we wrote several articles about ourselves and our project and then  communicated with Professor Ma, a master tutor. He gave us some good suggestions that broaden our minds after we exchanged our ideas with him. We also communicated with Professor Liu, who gladly helped check our project documents and the experimental procedures by pointing our mistakes and giving some advice with patience.
While it is certainly very satisfying to work in a laboratory, such communications that are very rewarding as well.
2.Video conferences
At 3pm on the afternoon of September 16th, 2016, we arranged a video conference with UESTC-Software team in order to further our understanding of each others’ projects and cooperate with each other. After getting the basic knowledge of each others’ project, we reached an agreement that the DNA data storage technology of UESTC can offer a lot help to us in terms of storing the efficient information of pathways, which is an indispensable part in navigation systems. Subsequently, at 7 pm in the evening, we had another video conference with NAU Team,  which also accomplished successfully. Through raising questions and giving advice, we have made the first step in our collaboration period.
