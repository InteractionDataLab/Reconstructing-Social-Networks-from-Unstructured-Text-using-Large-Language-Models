BIO-COMPASS
The aim of our project is to build a brand new bio-navigational system that can be used by the ordinary people. The map information will be coded in DNA strand and do corresponding biochemical operations. The bio-navigational database will establish the relationship between biochemical operation instructions and traditional navigation instructions. In order to reduce workload in advance， BIO-COMPASS can also screen reaction conditions according to the road conditions. Furthermore, we try to update the system to adapt to the more complex path plans. For this, we design some special enzyme sites which differ from standard bio-bricks’ as the function interfaces. For example, “Logic Gate” genetic device can be inserted in our system to help us solve the path plan which include a transfer station between the start and the destination. BIO-COMPASS will find the best solution by using a variety of detection methods such as electrophoresis and reporter gene.
BIO-COMPASS 2.0
A new updated version of bio–navigational system that enables a faster acquisition of optimal pathway will be built by the BIO-COMPASS 2.0 to break the limitations of computational capacity in the big data era. DNA will be used to encode the information of points and pathways on the map, and log into the bio-navigation database. In this way, each feasible solution can be obtained by the corresponding biochemical operation. Because of the high parallelism of the DNA calculation, the solution is rapid. Then by selecting the feasible solutions, finally determine the optimal solution. Compared with AHUT_China 2014's project, BIO-COMPASS 2.0 has added identification site, path length, and adjacent site number information into the DNA sequence used for path expressing. Besides, Quaternary has been applied in our calculation to optimize the data extraction methods. These improvements have boosted our system’s practicability and suitability when it is applied into more complex navigation.
Improved parts
olution24578 is the shortest pathway in the project of 2014 of AHUT_China, which Node NO.5 is a necessary node to be passed in order to get to Node NO.8. However, in our project of this year, we don’t have to pass Site NO.5 while taking Site NO.2 as the start point and Site NO.8 as the terminal, which provides us with more diverse pathway choices and more conforms to the real situation. In our project of 2016, the DNA single strands of the sites and lines are connected by bridging-PCR. 12 information bits are added to the DNA single strand of the lines, which the pre-4bp sequences contain the information of identification point, the mid-4bp sequences contain the information of the specified line, and the post-4bp contain the information of the path length. In order to obtain Solution24578, it needs to construct recombinant plasmid in every possible pathway. And then the recombinant plasmid was inserted in E.coli, where the fluorescent protein gene in Node NO.5 get expressed. Thus, all the pathways passing Node NO.5 screened out. By contrast, we don’t have to go through a series of complex process like what have been depicted above in order to obtain the shortest pathway <2-6-8> in this year.
