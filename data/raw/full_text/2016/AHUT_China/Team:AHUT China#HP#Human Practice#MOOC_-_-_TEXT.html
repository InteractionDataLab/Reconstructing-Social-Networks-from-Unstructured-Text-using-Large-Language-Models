MOOC
MOOC has also been a means of communicating to society, reaching out for those who do not know SynBio yet. By integrating iGEM and online courses, we made our own MOOC videos where our team members are the speakers. The videos include the introduction of IGEM competition, the knowledge about synthetic biology, our project outline and lab safety. This year, there have been 73,639 learners who joined us by learning our MOOC.
Our courses consist of seven major sections—iGEM’s introduction, modern molecular biology, synthetic biology, bioinformatics, current protocols, wiki web making and iGEM’s information search. We have created a comprehensive course system which is good at deepening students’ understanding of our courses.
Our MOOC videos consist of iGEM’s introduction, basics of synthetic biology and design of WIKI making with the view of letting more people be involved in iGEM by learning our online courses!
iGEM was founded by MIT in 2003. It is a top international academic competition in the field of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology aims to re-design the current natural biological system and build artificial biological parts and system to create a new biological system. The design and making of WIKI has given us the most humanistic vision experience and offered us an optimal project display platform with the interaction of science and humanity.
Besides our teaching materials, we have also made our teaching videos to help people get to know more about our project. Some relevant questions have also been given to assist students to strengthen what they’ve learned.
