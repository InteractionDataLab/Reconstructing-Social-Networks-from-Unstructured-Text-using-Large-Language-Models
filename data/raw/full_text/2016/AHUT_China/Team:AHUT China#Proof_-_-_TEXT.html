Under the support of the new standard biological navigation information database,we design specific primers for the 2 and 8 nodes. Second make all the DNA which carried nodes and path information randomly connected. Consequently, all possible path code combinations will be got. Third, the path of the least nodes will be selected by gel electrophoresis. Finally, the optimal solution of the least nodes and shortest path coupling will be found by sequencing and four binary operation of the information site. According to this method, we can get the condition of traffic.At last we got answer—— <2-4-8>,<2-6-8> and etc.
Four base sequences are used to represent the number of the path, with the digital combination of “start site+ end site”, the numbers are still represented by the Quaternary with four representative of AGCT, and the starting site and ending site are represented by two bases respectively. As well as we can use the experimental cycle time as the simulation of the 24 hours in a real day.Besides we can also change the reaction parameters, such as temperature, PH, etc. In order to change the reaction activation energy; thus, we can conduct simulation experiments of various traffic conditions.
