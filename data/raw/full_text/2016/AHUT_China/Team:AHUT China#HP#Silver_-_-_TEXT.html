1.Validated Part / Validated Contribution: Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part of Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document this characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part's/Device's Registry entry. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This working part must be different from the part documented in bronze medal criterion #4.
We have validated that our new BioBrick Part, BBa_K2044000- BBa_K2044014, different from Bronze BBa_K2044015-BBa_K2044022, works as expected. See our Proof of Concept and Results page or the (Part Registry entry) page to see how.
2. Collaboration: Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university or another institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
This year, we collaborated with NAU-CHINA, UESTC-software and JSNU-China, exchanging ideas, giving advice and helping perfect each other’s projects. Our key contributions to other teams are as following:
1. We had a discussion with some team members of NAU-CHINA, who came to our college with their wonderful ideas and great interests. Finally, we have assisted them with producing a practical model, which is a physical unit that can degree 3-PBA thoroughly and sterilize agricultural waste water.
2. We helped UESTC-software team to accomplish the part of software testing. We tested the randomness of Bio101 as their first user and offered them with a software testing report and analyzed bzip2 compression algorithm through building mathematical modeling.
3. Besides, we made a quick flashing video with JSNU-China iGEM team, which is also an interesting part of our human practice.
3.Human Practices: iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addresed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities.
The moment we started our project, we have been well aware of the significance of human practice as it serves as medium to spread wonderful ideas to the public and also a great access for us to see some practical problems that can only be solved by pragmatic approaches.
In terms of our laws and regulations which have a lot to do with ethical issues, we have improved our awareness of latent risks of science and technology and people will have more legal consciousness about this, especially for developers. We promoted our project in middle school, high school and our college, where we were quite enjoying the process of inspiring the participants, answering questions and introducing our BIO-COMPASS2.0. Through our questionnaire analysis, more information about the opinions of the general public were gleaned, which presented useful data for us. Besides, we also did and posted MOOC, arranged meetups, held activities on Science Day, made flashing videos and so forth. What’s more, during communicating with some navigational companies, valuable advice were given and they are all good for our future development, more efficient work, discovering potential market and making breakthroughs. What’s fantastic about the process is that they had shown great interest in our project and intended to seek cooperation in the future.
