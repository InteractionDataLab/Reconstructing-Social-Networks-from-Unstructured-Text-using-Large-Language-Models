Business Plan
Business plan
We wrote our business plan not for starting a business, but for exploring the business perspectives of our project. Writing a business plan can be useful to communicate the key business elements to different target audience: the iGEM community and the general public.
The purpose is to provide an analysis of the development and commercial economic viability and likelihood of the new bio-navigational system that enables a faster optimal pathway scheme and a more convenient calculation process under this big data era to break the limitation of computational capacity.
1. Summary
With Bio-compass, we want to cooperate with the current navigation company by providing technical background support, forming an image that encourages creativity and sheds light on synthetic biology.
The research shows that, as a new kind of molecular computing model, DNA calculation has some advantages that the electronic computer can not match. However, due to the limitation of methods and techniques, DNA calculation has not been widely used in our daily life.
However, we believe that we can simplify the experimental procedure to increase efficiency and reduce cost, which takes full advantage of dig data processing of bio-computer to create a better future.
2. Project description - Why Bio-compass?
With Bio-compass, we want to cooperate with the current navigation company by providing technical background support, forming an image that encourages creativity and sheds light on synthetic biology.
The research shows that, as a new kind of molecular computing model, DNA calculation has some advantages that the electronic computer can not match. However, due to the limitation of methods and techniques, DNA calculation has not been widely used in our daily life.
However, we believe that we can simplify the experimental procedure to increase efficiency and reduce cost, which takes full advantage of dig data processing of bio-computer to create a better future.
2.1 What is DNA calculation?
DNA algorithm makes use of DNA molecular structure and the principle of complementary base pairing to code information and algorithm, so that issues to be managed can be mapped as a specific DNA molecular segment. Then solutions could be available through the controllable biochemical reaction. The final operation result could be tested and obtained through various modern molecular biological techniques such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), technology of Overlapping amplification polymerization (POA), Ultrasonic Degradation, Affinity Chromatography, Molecular Purification, Cloning, Mutagenesis, Electrophoresis, Mseparation and Sequencing.
2.2 What are the overwhelming advantages of DNA calculation?
The nature of concurrency is incredible(the biggest advantage)
The operational speed is quite high
The energy consumption is much less than that of the electronic computer.
The calculation time is far less than the electronic computer.
The needed storage capacity is small.
The character of anti electromagnetic interference is helpful.
The manufacturing cost is low, and the material can be reused.
2.3 How does Bio-compass help companies and end-user clients?
With respect to the current navigation companies, Bio-compass provides a new way of navigation with less costs and higher efficiency. We can focus on the technical background works when cooperating with the company and to make a win-win situation. Hence, companies are able to launch new products like apps or other platforms to benefit the public, and make profits at the same time. Besides, the greatness of our Bio-compass lies in its efficiency of the environmentally friendly operation system that will not waste lots of energy or resources.
On the client side, cost advantage for navigation companies can be translated into either lower prices for customers, or higher quality of products through re-investment and innovation. Customers do not need to rely on systems using computational methods which can be inaccurate(we have found that many people are unsatisfied with some navigation apps in this regard through our investigation) or confusing any more. Days will come soon when locating somewhere and reaching there can happen in seconds. And under those circumstances, time and energy can be saved as time is usually precious for modern people. Optimal and fastest are what we pursue.
3. Current situation
With the development of the navigation technology, various services concerning solving locating and navigating problems are upsurging in all kinds ways. Companies are pushing forward and upgrading current systems to survive in the fierce competition as well as render more conveniences to customers so as to enter a more developed epoch. We strongly believe the advent of new products and services that combine the merits of biological methods and electrical access will certainly benefit the whole society and improve people’s living standard greatly. Here are some information about companies’ current mode of operating and manufacturing after our field visit.
3.2 Deep Implanting Based on Location
Soft implanting can be adopted in searching and surrounding-searching; Group purchase, coupons and things alike can be integrated to Poi information. By the same token, all of those can be further implemented through innovation.
3.3 Implanting Independent Assortment Based on Target Users
Soft implanting can be adopted in searching and surrounding-searching; Group purchase, coupons and things alike can be integrated to Poi information. By the same token, all of those can be further implemented through innovation.
3.4 Dig Into Users’ Behaviors
Applying different push notifications according to different usage scenarios. This is a very crucial aspect to know more about the market so that relative and pertinent solutions or ideas will pop up, which will surely improve the efficiency and popularity.
3.5 Voice Messages
Companies usually take this as a significant part of promoting their products and improve the quality. After all, voice messages are widely used around the world and lots of hot apps have this function for it provides a better choice for people to get the needed information as soon as possible, especially when they are too busy to type.
Last but not least, the most exhilarating part is that many companies have shown their tremendous interest in our ideas and the project which serve as great inspirations for them to innovate. Considering all aspects, it is possible that it will be applied in the near future.
4. Product Analysis and Development
A SWOT analysis is used to assess the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of this project. Building upon this analysis we can proactively plan an effective strategy that will focus on the strengths of this product while bypassing or decreasing the weaknesses and possible threats.
5. Risk analysis
5.1 Technical
It is imperative that Bio-compass is closely monitored when it is scaled up to an industry level. When working with it on a small scale in the laboratory, it poses minimal and controllable threats. However, when utilized at an industry and commercial scale it might go wrong. Thus, only via close monitoring and regular security and safety checks can the producer ensure the chances for accidents is minimized.
5.2 Financial
As with many undertakings, financial risks can provide obstacles that even the most creative scientific solutions can struggle to overcome. In the business implementation process these risks can include failing to manage cost restraints and changes, and can quickly go up in smoke when unforeseen complications arise. Though we would like to hope that industry players would be open to trialing Bio-compass as a new way of navigation, in the real world this decision is likely to be made (for the most part) based on cost. Therefore, perhaps the greatest risk faced by Bio-compass is a failure to become economically viable: If we cannot demonstrate a process which at least has the potential to be economically scaled up, it will be anything but impossible for our new technology to be implemented on any meaningful scale.
5.3 Competitors
Another risk, which must be considered by businesses searching in the field of biology. Otherwise, is an unstable market with an increasing number of competitors. Although our ideas on applications are novel, a lot of navigational companies are gobbling up a share of the booming navigation industry. When that happens, some unfair or even illegal business strategies may be adopted to deduct costs or gain more profits, which will lead to the businesses’ going downhill. Therefore, in order to keep the industry prosperous as long as possible, competitors shall strike a balance between gaining and costing and their purpose should be custom-oriented. In addition, we believe that more relevant laws and regulations will come out.
5.4 Safety and Society
The community reaction to this pivot may present a risk. Prevailing public opinion could result in unforeseeable legal costs, slowing the development of technologies, and even regulatory obstruction. It is therefore necessary to firstly establish the different views on this issue held throughout the community, and secondly to explain or market the product so that the consumers understand the benefits of Bio-compass. There is no exaggerating that education and popularizing our ideas and core values and aims are of great importance in this regard.
6. Management and Organizational Structure
We propose an organizational structure based on the iGEM team structure. To provide high quality, specialized and customized services for a small number of clients, we organize as a Holacracy (Robertson, 2007). Similar to the iGEM team structure, a holacratic organization removes hierarchy by distributing responsibility and power across distinct roles. Team works are vital, and we hold that the integration of individual efforts and hierarchy-free atmosphere with a little guidance are bound to succeed.
Just like in iGEM, people are responsible for certain roles while also being free to help out in other areas. In this way, employees are involved and responsible, feeling that they drive the company forward by doing what they are best at. People can have several distinct roles and work on several different tasks/projects. A stable structure with concerted efforts are what tap the potential and boom the whole industry.
7. Sales and Marketing Strategy
To achieve positive market results with this strategy we plan the following: - openly communicate with navigational companies to increase service efficiency and quality. - provide testing, training, maintenance and upgrades.  - invest in R&D improvements of our core services and for potentially radical changes. - invest in providing high customizability of services based on customer requirements. Here is our sales business model.
