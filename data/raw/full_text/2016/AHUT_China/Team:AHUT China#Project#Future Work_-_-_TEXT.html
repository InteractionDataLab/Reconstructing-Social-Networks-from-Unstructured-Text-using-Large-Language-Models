Future Work
I. Simulate actual traffic conditions
We are going to adjust regulate enzyme activities by changing the reaction parameters, such as temperature, pH, etc. in order to change the reaction activation energy; thus, we can conduct simulation experiments of various traffic conditions.
II. Increase the dimension of the reaction system
a. Uni-dimensional To Two-dimensional: Add the level information of roads to the code information district, enriching the effective information of the single path length through adding road mileage, road width, road grade, speed design and so on.
b. Two-dimensional To Three-dimensional: Add further information of path’s height in order to take factors of elevation and slope into consideration and make a better assessment of possible optimal solution.
c. Three-dimensional To Four-dimensional: Each experiment lasts for a certain period, so we can use the experimental cycle time as the simulation of the 24 hours in a real day. Simulate different traffic conditions at different time by changing the reaction condition of a certain time as different traffic conditions determine optimal solution at this certain time.
III. Establish a new simulation database
Information of road levels and traffic conditions have been integrated into standardization and modularization and added into our database, so that it can reflect the real situation more roundly, so as to improve the credibility of the data.
IV.  Optimizing data extraction steps
In our future work, we will further optimize the process of data extraction, greatly simplify the extraction costs, so that to play more fully advantages of bio-computers .
V. Develop intelligent logistics
a. We can abstract the storage site to site, and main logistic to line, and through establishing intelligent logistics database, rapid logistic distribution could be available on the basis of highly shared information to reduce resource waste and transportation cost while increasing the efficiency.
b. When the express is delivered to the target city, Bio-compass 2.0 System will design an optimal delivering path for every deliveryman automatically using its parallelism in order to increase efficiency and save time.
VI. Commercial Exploration
Further exploration will be made in Bio-compass 2.0 to make it better serve our customers. We believe that a system of strong interactivity, good sharing, precise navigation and powerful function could be possible through our efforts!
