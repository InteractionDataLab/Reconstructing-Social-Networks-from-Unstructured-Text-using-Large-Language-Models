Laws on Intellectual Property Rights & Protection In China
Part 1: General Definition and Classification
Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the intellect for which a monopoly is assigned to designated owners by law.
Intellectual property rights (IPRs) are the protections granted to the creators of IP, and include trademarks, copyright, patents, industrial design rights, and in some jurisdictions trade secrets. Artistic works including music and literature, as well as discoveries, inventions, words, phrases, symbols, and designs can all be protected as intellectual property.
This brochure focuses on trademarks, copyright, patents and trade secrets.
The stated objective of most intellectual property law (with the exception of trademarks) is to "Promote progress." By exchanging limited exclusive rights for disclosure of inventions and creative works, society and the patentee/copyright owner mutually benefit, and an incentive is created for inventors and authors to create and disclose their work.
Part 2: Patent Law
This Law is enacted for the purpose of protecting the lawful rights and interests of patentees, encouraging invention-creation, promoting the application of invention-creation, enhancing innovation capability, promoting the advancement of science and technology and the economic and social development.
(1) Range of protection:
Firstly, Patent Law protects patentees’ invention-creation, which means inventions, utility models and designs.
Inventions mean new technical solutions proposed for a product, a process or the improvement thereof.
Utility models mean new technical solutions proposed for the shape and structure of a product, or the combination thereof, which are fit for practical use.
Designs mean, with respect to a product, new designs of the shape, pattern, or the combination thereof, or the combination of the color with shape and pattern, which are rich in an aesthetic appeal and are fit for industrial application.
Inventions and utility models for which patent rights are to be granted shall be ones which are novel, creative and of practical use.
Novelty means that the invention or utility model concerned is not an existing technology (which means the technologies known to the public both domestically and abroad before the date of application).
Creativity means that, compared with the existing technologies, the invention possesses prominent substantive features and indicates remarkable advancements, and the utility model possesses substantive features and indicates advancements.
Practical use means that the said invention or utility model can be used for production or be utilized, and may produce positive results.
For a design patent, the patentee shall submit a written request, drawings or pictures of the design, a brief description of the design, etc. The scope of protection shall be confined to the drawings or pictures and the brief description.
For an invention or utility model patent, the patentee shall submit the relevant documents, such as a written request, a written description and its abstract, and a written claim. The scope of protection shall be confined to what is claimed, explained by the written description and the pictures attached.
Patent rights shall not be granted for invention-creations that violate the law or social ethics, or harm public interests, or inventions that are accomplished by relying on genetic resources which are obtained or used in violation of the provisions of laws and administrative regulations.
Patent rights shall not be granted for any of the following:
(1) scientific discoveries;
(2) rules and methods for intellectual activities;
(3) methods for the diagnosis or treatment of diseases;
(4) animal or plant varieties (the patent right may be granted for the production methods of the products);
(5) substances obtained by means of nuclear transformation; and
(6) designs that are mainly used for marking the pattern, color or the combination of the two of prints.
(2) Application and Administration:
For an invention or utility model patent, the applicant shall submit the relevant documents, such as a written request, a written description and its abstract, and a written claim.
The written request shall include: the name of the invention or utility model, the name of the inventor or designer, the name or title and the address of the applicant, etc.
The written description shall contain a clear and comprehensive description of the invention or utility model so that a technician in the field of the relevant technology can carry it out (pictures can be attached to it).
The abstract shall contain a brief introduction to the main technical points.
The written claim shall, based on the written description, contain a clear and concise definition of the proposed scope of patent protection.
An applicant may amend his patent application documents, provided that the amendment does not exceed the original scope.
 
(3) Duration, Termination and Invalidation:
Duration:
Invention patent right:20 years;
Utility model and design patent right: 10 years.
The patentee shall pay annual fees commencing from the year when the patent right is granted.
Under any of the following circumstances, the patent right shall be terminated before the expiration of the duration:
(1) failure to pay the annual fee as required;
(2) the patentee waiving of the patent right by a written declaration;
Any unit or individual can request that the patent review board declare the said patent right invalid.
A compulsory license: under a compulsory license, an individual or company seeking to use another's intellectual property can do so without seeking the rights holder's consent, and pays the rights holder a set fee for the license.
Under any of the following circumstances, the patent administration may grant a compulsory license for exploitation of an invention or utility model patent:
(1) When it has been three years since the date the patent right is granted and four years since the date the patent application is submitted, the patentee, without legitimate reasons, fails to have the patent exploited or fully exploited;
(2) The patentee's exercise of the patent right is confirmed as monopoly and its negative impact on competition needs to be eliminated or reduced.
Where a national emergency or any extraordinary state of affairs occurs, or public interests so require, the patent administration department may grant a compulsory license for exploitation of an invention or utility model patent.
For the benefit of public health, the patent administration department may grant a compulsory license for manufacture and exportation of a drug, for which a patent right has been obtained.
If an invention or utility model represents a major technological advancement of remarkable economic significance compared with an earlier one, and exploitation of the former relies on exploitation of the latter, the patent administration department may grant it a compulsory license to exploit the former.
(4) Measures of protection:
If a dispute arises, it shall be settled through consultation between the parties. If consultation fails, the patentee or interested party may take legal action before court, and may also request the administration department to handle the dispute. If the infringement is believed to be established, the infringer may be ordered to cease the infringement immediately; if the infringer is dissatisfied with the order, he may take legal action within 15 days. If the infringer neither takes legal action nor ceases the infringement, there may be compulsory enforcement. The administration department may carry out mediation. If mediation fails, the parties may take legal action before court.
If a dispute over patent infringement involves an invention patent for the method of manufacturing a new product, the unit or individual manufacturing the same product shall provide evidence to show that its method is different from the patented one.
If a dispute over patent infringement involves a utility model patent or a design patent, the patentee or the interested parties may be required to present a patent right assessment report prepared by the patent administration department as evidence.
The period of limitation for action against patent right infringement shall be two years, commencing from the date when the infringement is known.
Part 3: Trademark Law
(1) Range of Protection:
Registered trademarks mean trademarks that have been approved and registered by the Trademark Office, including trademarks, service marks, collective marks and certification marks.

A collective mark is a trademark owned by an organization (such as an association), used by its members to identify themselves with a level of quality or accuracy, geographical origin, or other characteristics set by the organization.
A certification mark on a commercial product often indicates the existence of an accepted product standard and a claim that the manufacturer has tested the product to verify compliance with that standard.
The following signs shall not be used as trademarks:
(1) those identical with or similar to the State name, national flag, national emblem, military flag, or decorations, of the People's Republic of China, with names of the places where the Central and State organs are located, or with the names and designs of landmark buildings;

(3) those lacking distinctive features.
(2) Application and Administration:
Where two or more applicants apply for the registration of identical or similar trademarks for the same or similar goods, the preliminary approval and the publication shall be made for the trademark which was first filed. If applications are filed on the same day, the preliminary approval and the publication shall be made for the trademark which was the earliest used.
The use of a trademark means using it on goods, their packages, containers and trading documents, or using it in advertising, exhibitions or other commercial activities to mark the source of goods.
(3) Duration, Termination and Invalidation:
The period of validity of a registered trademark shall be ten years, counted from the date of approval of the registration.
An application for renewal of the registration shall be made within six months before the expiration of the period. Where no application therefore has been filed within the said period, a grace period of six months may be allowed.
The period of validity of each renewal of registration shall be ten years.
Any trademark registrant may, by signing a trademark license contract, authorize other persons to use his registered trademark. The licensor shall supervise the quality of the goods in respect of which the licensee uses his registered trademark, and the licensee shall guarantee the quality of the goods.
Where a registered trademark has been cancelled or has not been renewed at the expiration, the Trademark Office shall, during one year from the date of the cancellation or removal thereof, approve no application for the registration of a trademark that is identical with or similar to the said trademark.
(4) Methods of Protection:
The exclusive right to use a registered trademark is limited to the approved trademark and goods to use it.

(4) to replace, without the consent of the trademark registrant, its registered trademark and market the goods again;
(5) to cause prejudice to the exclusive right of another person to use a registered trademark.
The amount of damages shall be the profit that the infringer has earned because of the infringement, including the appropriate expenses of the infringe for stopping the infringement.
Where it is difficult to determine the profit, the People's Court shall impose an amount of damages of no more than RMB 500, 000 yuan according to the circumstances.
Anyone who sells goods that he does not know has infringed the right of a registered trademark, and is able to prove that it or he has obtained the goods legitimately and indicates the supplier thereof shall not bear the liability for damages.
Where any party has committed any of such acts to infringe the exclusive right to use a registered trademark and has caused a dispute, the interested parties shall resolve the dispute through consultation; if the consultation fails, the trademark registrant or interested party may institute legal proceedings in the People's Court or request the administrative authority for industry and commerce for actions.

Part 5: Trade Secrets
A trade secret is a formula, practice, process, design, instrument, pattern, commercial method, or compilation of information which is not generally known or reasonably ascertainable by others, and by which a business can obtain an economic advantage over competitors or customers.</span>
In China, there isn’t a set of laws to protect trade secrets specifically. Owners of trade secrets seek to these information by instituting special procedures like non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), and work-for-hire and non-compete clauses.
However, trade secrets are still loved by companies, for as secrets, they do not need to be exposed to the public like patents (maybe that is why they are not specially protected).
