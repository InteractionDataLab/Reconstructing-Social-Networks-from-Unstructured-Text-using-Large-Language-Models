		The first test we did was to optimize our PCR protocol to achieve DNA product that is only of the segment that is utilized in our structure. This allows us to omit the DNA segment from the M13mp18 DNA that is not being utilized. You can see the gel 1 (below left) shows the not optimized PCR while the Gel 2 (below right) shows the optimized PCR product. A single thin and bright band at approximately 7000 BP shows us that the sample analyzed on Gel 2 is almost fully optimized, as oppose to the not optimized version.

The concentration and reaction parameters were adapted from Dr Seidel’s group. The mixture of purified linear ssDNA M13mp18 is mixed with staples and Folding Buffer in a single pot and heated to +80OC and cooled slowly over 15 hours using non-linear temperature ramp. Using Agarose Gel Electrophoresis, we analyzed the folding structure and TEM imaging we obtained multiple structures that fit the size of our model design. These structures were aligning head to tail when viewed under the TEM (Figure).

The Process uses RFII plasmid DNA of m13mp18 bacteriophage as a template. This template is then reacted with two primers flanking the desired origami template sequence with the reverse primer being phosphorylated. Using Phusion Polymerase, a 7kp PCR product is formed containing the template strand. The following digestion of the phosphorylated strand is conducted at with lambda exonuclease at 37 degrees for 1 hour. The ssDNA product is then purified either by spin column or phenol:chloroform extraction. The purified product is then mixed at a concentration of 1:10 template strand to origami staples and is cooled for 15 hours on a nonlinear gradient in a thermocycler.

        FlexStation 3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader was used to run the assays on Photosystem II (PSII) proteoliposomes. The test is to monitor the internal pH of the proteoliposomes with Pyranine pH probe upon exposing it to light. Light causes the PSII protein to split 2 water molecules into 4H+, 4e-  and 2 oxygen molecules. Based on internal acidification of alkalization, the orientation of PSII can be determined. If the quinone channel is oriented right side up, the expected result is to see the split of water inside the proteoliposomes thus internal acidification. 
               </P><P>
        After adding 175ul of assay and 25ul of proteoliposome sample, an initial reading is taken at λem = 410 nm and λexc= 460 nm. The reading ratio of 460/404 is used to determine the pH value for each sample. In this experiment, a ‘control’ sample that does not contain PSII was used to confirm that the proton activity is only due to the protein integrated in the liposome. In addition, the ‘control’ sample contained 3mM and 7mM CHAPS detergent labelled Rsat (lipid to detergent ratio~ 17.4) and Rsol (lipid to detergent ratio~ 7.5) respectively.
               </P><P>
        Other controls in the experiment included Valinomycin, an ionophore that balances K+ ions down electrochemical gradient; Ferricyanide (FeCY), an electron acceptor impermeable to plasma membranes are in the assay outside the liposome; p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide (DPX) quenches the non-permeant pyranine pH indicator dye reconstituted in the liposome along with PSII protein, which is used to measure florescence intensity with proton activity. 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone (DCBQ) and decylubiquinone (DQ) were the different electron acceptors tested in the assays; DCBQ degrades after long exposure to light, whereas DQ is stable for much longer period of time.

        Adding Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) in the assay mixture is uncouple the liposome membrane, break down electrochemical gradient, and balance pH between assay and liposome. As a result, the pH of the sample increases. In this experiment, upon addition of CCCP after the 1020 seconds mark, the expected result is to see the pH going from an acidic state back to a state of equilibrium.

      The initial pH of the buffer was at 6.52; the 4 samples (Control Rsat, Control Rsol, CHAPS Rsat, CHAPS Rsol) which initially had the 1.5uM CCCP in the assay had pH relatively close to the 6.52 assay buffer value. In other words, the CCCP uncouples liposome that caused the proton gradient to break thus equalizing the pH inside the liposome and outside in the assay. Comparing the group with CCCP to the group without, the data suggests that the CCCP was effective in uncoupling the liposome membrane to some extent.  For CHAPS Rsat and Rsol, the delta pH for group with CCCP is higher than without. It is necessary to consider that only 1.5uM CCCP was in the assay, which may not have been enough to cause complete destruction of the proton gradient. Thus, with the CCCP the movement of proton in the assay may be faster. The CHAPS Rsat and Rsol without any CCCP suggests the PSII is incorporated in the liposome as the pH gradually increases upon illumination; After addition of CCCP to CHAPS Rsat and Rsol at 1020seconds~ mark, although initially the pH increases, it stabilizes after the 5 minutes’ incubation supporting the idea that PSII was causing the alkalizing of the liposome as it is oriented upside down.
</P><P>
      All the liposomes alkalize upon illumination- water is split to proton outside of the liposome and into the assay; the gradual increase of pH for all the groups excluding Control Rsat/Rsol with CCCP suggests that there is no leakage in the liposome. For all control group, the pH gradually increases by small units (0.03~ units) each time even after the addition of CCCP at 1020 seconds~ time mark. Comparing the control Rsat/Rsol to CHAPS Rsat/Rsol shows that having the PSII small changes in pH with illumination. However, once CCCP is added, the proton gradient causes 0.4 units of pH changes. Overall, using DCBQ as the electro acceptor in the assay suggested that PSII is functionally incorporated in liposomes CHAPS Rsat and Rsol.
</P><DIV class="article-cap"><STRONG>Figure 1. PSII E.coli Total Lipid Extract Liposome Reconstitution with Pyranine Screening and DQ.</STRONG></DIV><P>
      With DQ as the electron acceptor, the initial pH of all is resistant to change with the light illumination incubation. However, with longer periods of time in light incubation, the pH for Rsat and Rsol without CCCP increases gradually suggesting the PSII protons are found out of the liposome and is alkalizing the inner core. After CCCP is added at 1020seconds mark, the pH stabilizes. 
</P><P>
      Although the pH of all the samples increase substantially after the 500 seconds mark, only the liposomes with the PSII have a high delta pH increase. This could potentially be because the PSII is slowly being activated by the light illumination. Furthermore, adding CCCP causes the CHAPS Rsat and Rsol to slow down their proton activity as it reaches a plateau of very little change at the end of the experiment period. An important aspect to note about DQ is that it may not be a fast electron acceptor and is easily affected by uncoupling of proton gradient as the pH does not change much after adding CCCP. CHAPS Rsat with CCCP had the highest delta pH and the alkalizing begins shortly after 300 seconds of incubation in light.
