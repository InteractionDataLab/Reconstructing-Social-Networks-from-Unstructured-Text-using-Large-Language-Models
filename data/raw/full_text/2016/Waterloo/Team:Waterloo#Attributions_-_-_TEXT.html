Introduction
Our project was the product of a number of people’s contributions and hard work. On this page we would like to acknowledge the efforts of our team, advisors, supporters and the like. Each and everyone of these people and groups were integral additions to the Waterloo iGEM 2016 project.
2016 Team Members Idea and Project Development
This year we conducted our project brainstorming and development in 3 parts to incorporate the entire team. Since our team consisted of 34 students we decided to first narrow down our potential projects amongst the project director and 4 sub-team leads in February. Through internal brainstorming among our leads team, the first iteration of our “OFF to PriON” project was established.
The foundation of the project idea was then further developed in the second phase of our brainstorming with the rest of the students on our team in early March (click here to learn more about our team). Our team consists of students in programs ranging from biochemistry to nanotechnology who each brought a number of perspectives and knowledge bases.
The third phase of our development consisted of detailed design of the execution of our project which consisted of experimental design, modeling potential and human practices research. The bulk of the project design phase ended in May with ongoing modifications made throughout the season as necessary. Execution of these plans began in June and continued on until late September. The project itself was developed independently by the students on the Waterloo iGEM 2016 team and executed throughout the summer with support in the following areas.
2016 Team Advisors
We were very fortunate to have 7 advisors this year for our team ranging from disciplines in applied mathematics and sociology to molecular biology. The following advisors offered valuable feedback and knowledge to our team throughout the entire 2016 iGEM season from the start of our project to its completion.
Dr. Trevor Charles: Professor - Biology
Forbes Burkowski: Associate Professor Emeritus - Computer Science
Dr. Barbara Moffatt: Professor - Biology
Dr. John McLevey: Assistant Professor - Knowledge Integration
Dr. Andrew Doxey: Assistant Professor - Biology
Dr. Brian Ingalls: Associate Professor - Applied Mathematics
Dr. Marc Aucoin: Associate Professor - Chemical Engineering
