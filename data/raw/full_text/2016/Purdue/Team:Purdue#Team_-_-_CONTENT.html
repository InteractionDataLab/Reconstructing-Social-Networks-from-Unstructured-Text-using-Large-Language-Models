</DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><P>Just to give you a little background on what iGEM is all about: The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. iGEM began in January of 2003 with a month-long course at MIT. This design course grew to a summer competition, which has evolved over the past ten years to include over 300 teams from all over the world. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts at the beginning of summer. Working at their own schools over the summer, they design and build biological systems and operate them in living cells.</P><P>2006 marks the year that Purdue began its journey toward making a difference in the world of synthetic biology, entering the competition with seven undergraduate members and three advisors. Purdue continued to compete for the next four years, earning bronze medals almost every year but never anything more. Facing some trials and tribulations along this journey, Purdue did not field a team in the 2011 iGEM competition. Fortunately, the team was revived with enough interest and support to not only field a team in 2012 but to also receive a gold medal and advance to the international competition at MIT for the first time in the team’s history. Then in 2013 Purdue iGEM achieved an unprecedented success, ranking third in the undergraduate division of North America at the 2013 regional competition.</P><P>Now the Purdue Biomakers are back again, better than ever. With more members, increased funding, and a focus on upholding Purdue’s strong legacy in agriculture, conservation, engineering, and technology, you can expect the 2016 iGEM team to continue to redefine success, striving to reach even greater heights in this year’s iGEM competition!</P><P><CENTER><B>Figure 1:</B>The 2016 Purdue iGEM team in front of our lab building, Bindley Bioscience Center</CENTER></P></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><H3>Executive Board</H3><P dir="ltr"><A href="#jump1">Hana Kubo</A><A href="#jump2">Bowman Clark ☼</A><A href="#jump3">James Welch</A><A href="#jump4">Melissa Robins</A><A href="#jump5">Suraj Mohan ☼</A><A href="#jump6">Sean Magill ☼</A><A href="#jump8">Lexi Petrucciani</A><A href="#jump9">Ryan Budde</A><A href="#jump10">Paige Rudin ☼</A><A href="#jump11">Helena Lysandrou</A></P><P>☼ denotes member of the summer team</P></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><H3>General Members</H3><P dir="ltr"><A href="#jump12">Caleigh Roleck ☼</A><A href="#jump13">Rachael Eberle</A><A href="#jump14">Casey Martin</A><A href="#jump15">Jill Osterhus</A><A href="#jump16">Danish Ghazali</A><A href="#jump17">Archana Kikla</A><A href="#jump18">Barrett Davis ☼</A><A href="#jump19">Ethan Titus</A><A href="#jump20">Emma Foster ☼</A><A href="#jump21">Mark Aronson</A><A href="#jump21">Arren Liu</A></P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV dir="ltr"><H3>Hana Kubo</H3><H4 style="text-align: left;"><EM>President</EM></H4><P dir="ltr">Hana is a junior majoring in Genetics. She is so in love with DNA that she is convinced that she is going to marry it; she’s still waiting for the IDT proposal. Hana is the 2016 President of the Purdue Biomakers, but in reality she is just a figurehead and is actually held in captivity by Bo and the other executive board members. Hana is originally from Tokyo, but spent her elementary and middle school years in New York, and then high school years in Sydney, Australia. If this was the only thing you knew about Hana, you’d think she’s a pretty cool person. Hana hopes to become a research scientist and a university professor studying the genetics behind endometriosis, while working as a part-time K-Pop connoisseur. In her free time, Hana likes to dance in her seat while studying while listening to hard rock, as well as conduct excessively moderate online shopping. She often dreams of her cloning and transformations in her research lab working, or candles finally being permitted in residential halls. She then wakes up depressed because neither of those things will happen in real life.

She plans to get a PhD in something... eventually... Other than that she spends way too much time dancing, like WAY TOO MUCH. She has danced in almost every style, but is currently into Hip hop (she cannot twerk), Modern, and Tap. She also enjoys watching shows by Joss Whedon, making obscure musical references, and looking at math proofs online (weirdo).

Although most of his friends couldn't name his hometown, neither could he, as his move to Purdue is only the latest in a long line worthy of its own Indiana Jones travel montage. If ever you were to catch Barrett when he is not hurriedly cycling from class-to-meeting, meeting-to-class, class-to-class, or meeting-to-meeting, you would probably see him playing his saxophone, learning guitar, mountain biking, listening to podcasts, or pondering about life around him (for instance why people do things &quot;on purpose&quot; rather than &quot;with purpose&quot;).
As a person made of stardust and recycled carbon, Barrett likes to believe in the non-zero chance that some of the atoms which now make up his knees and toes once resided in the rotator cuffs of scientific or humanitarian giants such as Alexander Fleming, Leonard Euler, and Mahatma Gandhi, but he tries not to actively let it go to his head.
In the future Barrett hopes to work on improving medical infrastructure in the developing world, or (like Fleming) towards making leaps in the science of health and medicine in his respective century, be it through tissue, genetic, or pharmacological research (this time &quot;with purpose&quot;, unlike Fleming).<A href="#top">Back to Top</A></P><H3>Ethan Titus</H3><P dir="ltr">Ethan Titus is junior in biological engineering with a focus on cellular and biomolecular engineering.
