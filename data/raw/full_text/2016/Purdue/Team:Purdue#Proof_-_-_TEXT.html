Proof of Concept
We reached a proof of concept point for the Extraction step of our proposed system. Our extraction gene composite part PPX2 was tested in a long term phosphate experiment against unmodified E. coli The data can be viewed on the Results page. We also created a Prototype that we have yet to test.  We believe that our success in demonstrating PPX2’s effectiveness qualifies us for the proof of concept gold criteria.
