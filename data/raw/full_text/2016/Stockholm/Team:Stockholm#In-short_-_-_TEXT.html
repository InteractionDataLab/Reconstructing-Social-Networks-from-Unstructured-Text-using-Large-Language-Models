SMITe - The Concept: In short
The Issue
Chronic wounds and antibiotic resistance are issues increasing in importance and often go hand-in-hand
Current treatment strategies for chronic wounds rely on mechanical removal of dead tissue, or systemic antibiotic therapy, which are largely ineffective or come with considerable risks for the patient
A major reason for ineffective treatments are biofilms; structures secreted by bacteria to facilitate establishment of a chronic infection
Our goals for SMITe: Spider Silk Mediated Infection Treatment:
We aim to construct a functional dressing for chronic wounds, using spider silk as a scaffold to attach biofilm-degrading enzymes. This includes:
Expressing biofilm-degrading 'combat proteins’ and quantifying their potency
Assembling combat proteins with a linker and tag needed for purification and attachment to spider silk
Attaching the enzymes to spider silk using Sortase A, a transpeptidase
Isolating Sortase A from the S.aureus genome and creating a ‘Sortase Package’ including basic parts needed for other iGEM teams to use Sortase in their own projects
Testing the efficacy of the fully assembled wound dressing with attached enzymes on biofilms
