However, with this attributions page, the iGEM Stockholm team of 2016 would like to thank the supervisors, advisors, sponsors and everyone else involved, supporting and guiding us throughout the project with their experience and expertise within a broad range of life-science fields. The realisation of this endeavor would not have been possible without them. We would also like to thank Spiber Technologies for making  synthetically produced spider silk accessible to us, an important and generous gift to this project.</P><H4 id="supervisors">Supervisors</H4><DIV class="sideimage"><DIV><DIV>Assistant Professor <B>Johan Rockberg</B>, Primary PI
