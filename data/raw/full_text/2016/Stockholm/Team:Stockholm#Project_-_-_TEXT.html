SMITe - The Concept: Our Project
Our Project
Our vision is a functional wound dressing which will be able to disperse early-stage S.aureus biofilms in chronic wounds. The scaffold for this dressing is formed by spider silk – a material not only known for its high tensile strength but also for being biocompatible and largely non-immunogenic. Those features make it an ideal candidate material for potential wound dressings. [9]
To actively fight the biofilm, several biofilm-degrading 'combat proteins' are attached to the silk via Sortase A, a transpeptidase isolated from S.aureus. This constitutes a broadly-based approach which will hopefully forestall any bacterial escape or resistance mechanisms.
The combat proteins will target three main components of the biofilm:
extracellular DNA (eDNA)
Poly-N-Acetylglucosamine (PNAG) and Staphylococci themselves
Biofilm-associated proteins
Click on each of the components to learn more about it and about how we are planning to target it.
However, our mission is far from being limited to chronic wound treatment – products similar to our wound dressing could find applications far beyond the medical field.
