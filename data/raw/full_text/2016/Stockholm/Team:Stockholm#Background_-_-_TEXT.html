Biofilms
With both chronic wounds and the variety of bacterial resistance mechanisms in our minds we were concerned about using traditional bactericidal approaches to aid chronic wound healing, which often stumble into one of two pitfalls:
a largely unspecific effect which risks to further aggravate the wound [3]
a limited efficacy on chronic wounds from the very start and / or decreasing efficacy during the course of the treatment [4]
So instead, iGEM Stockholm decided to focus on a prominent feature of many chronic wounds – the biofilm.
Biofilms are complex extracellular structures generated by a variety of bacteria as a self-protection mechanism and are often increased in response to stress such as antibiotic treatment. [5] They are essential in supporting bacteria when they adopt a ‘sessile’ lifestyle in the form of chronic colonization; they interfere with inflammation meant to rid the wound of bacteria, help the bacteria attach and detach from the wound surface as the infection progresses and have been found to contribute to quicker development of antibiotic resistance. [6] [7]
The components of biofilms differ among bacterial species but many of them have been found to serve a specific purpose. Three structures observed commonly in different biofilms are expolysaccharides, extracellular DNA and a variety of biofilm-associated proteins.
The vital role that biofilm plays in persistent infections provides a solid rationale for making them our primary target.
Figure 1: Overview of typical structure of biofilms
The above image depicts the pillar-shaped structure biofilms often adapt, with a distinct distribution of components in different sections of the pillars.
Three major components of many biofilms - extracellular DNA, expolysaccharides and a range of proteins - not only serve their own specific purposes, but also interact with each other to fortify the structure of the biofilm.
