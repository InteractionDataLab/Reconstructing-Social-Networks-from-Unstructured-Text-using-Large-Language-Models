Human Practices
Even though the field of synthetic biology may seem difficult to define and beyond the remit of many people’s day to day lives, it's presence in our homes and workplaces is ever growing.  Many of the foods we buy, medicines we use and services that are offered would not exist without synthetic biology and are very much taken for granted.
This means that without knowledge of a product's origin, production process, proper usage and disposal, some risks are inevitable.
For these reasons, we believe it is vital to make information accessible to people in all walks of life, allowing them to make informed decisions.
We have tried to demonstrate a model for achieving this through integrating education, increased public awareness and of course, igniting curiosity in synthetic biology.
iGEM Stockholm’s human practices project extends far beyond the bench through our innovative iTECH model, integrating the four different components of our Human Practices work: Teaching, Evolving, Community & Health.
TEACHING: Schools Projects
EVOLVING: Makerspace Lab & Workshops
COMMUNITY: Integrating Human Practices & Nordic iGEM Conference
HEALTH: Expert advice and the development of SMITE
The iTECH model framework has allowed us to develop a public dialogue, which engages with different groups of the population about synthetic biology and the journey from the lab towards our product.
Overall this vastly improved the foundations of our research and challenged us to question how and why our project could be successful.
The following are different ways our Human Practices project has impacted our society:
Raising awareness of synthetic biology at all educational levels (spanning ages 9-11, 15-18 and 20+ in different arms of the project)
Providing an educational backdrop for young researchers on a practical and theoretical basis
Encouraging creative thinking in the approach to combating deep seated problems
Introducing innovative new approaches to treating chronic wounds
Promoting consideration of the global impact of human civilisation and how we can use synthetic biology in the future to adapt to a changing world
Predicting the consequences of inaction in relation to antimicrobial resistance on future generations
