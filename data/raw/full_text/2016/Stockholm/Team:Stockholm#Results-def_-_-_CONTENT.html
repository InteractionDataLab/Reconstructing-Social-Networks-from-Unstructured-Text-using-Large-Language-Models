These were neglected and the sample was used for digestion with subsequent ligation with the linker-tag (LT) sequence. The restriction sites of both the linearized plasmid (amplification product) and the LT sequence were located on the very ends of the DNA strands.

There, the band corresponding to spider silk protein is clearly at a size of approximately 23 kDa, the expected size of the spider silk protein.
