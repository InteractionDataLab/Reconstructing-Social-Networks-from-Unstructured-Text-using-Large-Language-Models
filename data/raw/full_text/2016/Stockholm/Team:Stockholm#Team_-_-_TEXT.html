Members
Ellinor Lindholm Project leader Nuc and Defensin BioBrick, Human Practices, NiC MSc Medical Biotechnology       KTH Royal Institute of Technology Why iGEM? -   iGEM is a unique opportunity to combine knowledge obtained from school with economy, research, management and lab work. Not to mention all the fun! Fun fact - I don’t remember anyone beating me in Mario Kart from Nintendo 64. Challenge accepted?
Aman Mebrahtu Head of NiC Sortase A BioBrick, Finances MSc Medical Biotechnology       KTH Royal Institute of Technology Why iGEM? - Wanted a forum that was within the field of Biotech where one can play around with different ideas and try them out in an actual wet lab. iGEM is perfect for just that! Fun fact - I like eating pancakes before eating a meal of pasta.
Oscar He Head of Funding Nuc and Defensin BioBrick, Human Practices, NiC MSc Medical Biotechnology       KTH Royal Institute of Technology Why iGEM? - An opportunity to apply everything you learned in school to a real project. Fun fact - Personal best: 13.5 clicks/sec on a computer mouse.
Reskandi Rudjito Lysostaphin and Sortase A BioBricks, NiC MSc Industrial and Environmental Biotechnology       KTH Royal Institute of Technology Why iGEM? - I think iGEM is a valuable learning experience to develop your skills in research. It is also a fun opportunity to meet and work with people who share similar interests in life sciences! Fun fact - I much prefer ‘boring’ historical dramas to action films anytime.
Sigrun Stulz Head of Research Esp BioBrick, Human Practices MSc Biomedicine, Immunology       Karolinska Institutet Why iGEM? It's the perfect mix of real world research & management experience and spending a summer playing with really cool new toys. Fun fact - I learned 90% of my English vocabulary from the Twilight books. The fascination with the franchise passed but I still know about 15 synonyms for the world 'sparkle' - quiz me if our paths cross!
Bethel Tesfai Embaie Head of Human Practices Lysostaphin BioBrick, NiC BSc Biomedicine       Karolinska Institutet Why iGEM? - An opportunity to work with a creative and ambitious team to push the boundaries of synthetic biology! Fun fact - The little one, but very smart
Oscar Frisell Photos, Social Media, NiC MSc Industrial and Environmental Biotechnology       KTH Royal Institute of Technology Why iGEM? - It’s a perfect mixture of learning and having fun simultaneously within the area of biotech. Fun fact - I inhale tea when i study.
Shuangjia Nicole Xue Esp BioBrick, NiC MSc Toxicology       Karolinska Institutet Why iGEM? - Gain more experience and knowledge within the field of synthetic biology. Fun fact - I have telepathy with my twin sister. We once screenshotted the same video and realized it two months later.
Oskar Öhman Esp BioBrick, Finances MSc Medical Biotechnology       KTH Royal Institute of Technology Why iGEM? - To gain experience more experience and knowledge outside of my studies Fun fact - Tip: Listen to "He lives in you" from the Lion King while cooking. You are gonna have an epic time.
Jenny Waspe Human Practices, Wiki Editor MSc Toxiocology       Karolinska Institutet Why iGEM? - I chose iGEM as the concept was something totally new to me and a great opportunity to learn about project planning and synthetic biology. Fun fact - I've traveled all over the Himalayas!
Aliki Mitropoulou Human Practices MSc Toxicology       Karolinska Institutet Why iGEM? -  iGEM is a great opportunity to interact with people from various backgrounds, learn about new ideas and solve problems in a creative way. Fun fact - I am obsessed with old black and white films. I can never get bored of them!
Linnea Våglund Design, Wiki, NiC Design       Konstfack Why iGEM? - The future is mind boggling. Fun fact - I know the biggest cat in the world.
Maren Maanja Nuc BioBrick, NiC, Human Practices Medicine       Karolinska Institutet Why iGEM? - To do research in a multi-professional team and explore and find out new things! Fun fact - Before medical school I took a "gap semester" and studied mechanical engineering.
Leo Fidjeland Website, Design, NiC Engineering Physics       KTH Royal Institute of Technology Why iGEM? - To get closer to the science of synthetic biology. Fun fact - I have done about 280 skydives.
