The concept of iGEM had already been introduced into their curriculum through an extended exam question based on a scientific article discussing synthetic biology, iGEM and the use of standard biological parts, so we took the opportunity to expand on these principles and help students apply them to a host of real life situations. 
The overall aim was to inspire students with an innate interest in biology (just like us) to pursue these new ideas in more depth and possibly be influenced into studying these even further as they progress through their education. Naturally we also aimed to make the project interesting, thought provoking, collaborative and fun!</P><P>Following a positive response from both teachers and pupils about becoming involved in our project, we developed an online educational programme composed of <A href="https://igem.se/p/ec79b10a-d3e8-400d-9bc6-fed9ee66c794/">case studies</A>, which was accessible through our main website.  </P><H5 id="imagewouldbegoodhereanythingeducational">image would be good here-anything educational</H5><H4 id="theprogramme">The Programme</H4><P>Our education programme incorporated work on 4 main areas (detailed below). For each area the student had to imagine themselves in a position of authority and respond to an issue at hand. We also emphasized the importance of ethical decision making. Just because we have the know-how, does it give us the right to continue to modify our world with biology and what are the risks and benefits of doing so.</P><H4 id="howdoesitwork">How does it work?</H4><P>Each of the first 3 areas constituted 2 separate case studies linked to a variety of resources (videos, scientific articles, images and websites). One main question was set in relation to each available case, encouraging students to research specific questions and present an opinion, idea or perspective on one of the two options. 
Each set of 2 cases were left running on the website for a period of 2 weeks, following which work was submitted by email to a central contact point and assessed by the Human Practices team. 
Any submission was carefully read and individuals or groups were given personalized feedback by email (we were always impressed with the quality of the pieces entered!).</P><H6 id="rewardingstudentefforts">Rewarding student efforts</H6><P>Once the students had submitted all their work on the various case studies, we compiled their efforts in each category and presented them through <A href="https://igem.se/our-project/">igem.se</A>. Viewers were invited to vote via an integrated survey on the best work in each field, with an overall view of selecting winners! 
We circulated awareness of the students' work  to university students at KTH who were undertaking studies in relevant subject areas, but the invitation to read and comment on the submissions was also open to anyone interested.</P><P>In the following sections, describing the case studies, we have included the winning pieces. </P><H5 id="thecasestudies">The Case Studies</H5><H6 id="syntheticbiologyinhealthrelatedconcepts">Synthetic biology in health related concepts</H6><P><STRONG>Case 1:</STRONG> Appealing to your hospital director to support the use of 3D printed biological organ replacements for a young patient in a serious motorcycle crash.</P><P><STRONG>Case 2:</STRONG> Preparing a presentation in a school where you are a biology teacher, informing your colleagues about the risks of a new 'home-made estrogen biolab' which has been set up locally.   </P><P><STRONG>Winning piece</STRONG></P><H6 id="environmentalsustainability">Environmental sustainability</H6><P><STRONG>Case 3:</STRONG> Preparing a project plan for your boss drawing on your research on ways synthetic biology can be used to detect and reduce heavy metal contamination of water used for drinking and cooking.

Then, for this final component in September we reversed the teacher-pupil roles by getting students to design their own case study centered on issues raised by the threat of antimicrobial resistance. We felt it was important to do this when introducing the main bulk of the ethical discussion our SMITE project centres around. 
Previously students had been presented with scenarios to think about and respond to, however, as reflected in the case of increasing rates of antibiotic resistance globally, we cannot simply wait for the situation to be presented to us...we all need to think ahead and take responsibility for the impact of our actions and lifestyles on the world. The task set was as follows:</P><H6 id="theneedforsmiteaddressingtheglobalthreatofantibioticresistance">The need for SMITE: addressing the global threat of antibiotic resistance</H6><P><STRONG>Case 7:</STRONG> Consider the issues raised by increasing antibiotic resistance (including the benefits novel therapies like SMITE may offer) in order to design your own advertising campaign to help combat the problem by raising awareness.</P><P>Requesting that the students present their work as an advertising campaign warning against antibiotic resistance enabled them to demonstrate skills in persuasive writing under a  popular science construct and also to display their creativity. 
To finalise this fourth component, we reviewed all the submissions and chose the best one(s) to present on our Wiki (see below).</P><P><STRONG>Winning piece</STRONG></P></SECTION></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV><FOOTER class="site-footer clearfix"><SECTION class="sponsors">
