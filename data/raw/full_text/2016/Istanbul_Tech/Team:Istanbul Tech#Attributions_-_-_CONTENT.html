The idea of the project and its development may simply have described as “a story of science and struggle” that lasted for almost 2 years, and now it’s time to give credits for all its contributors.

Sponsorship/Financial Support
We would like to thank Governor of Istanbul, VasipŞahin, and Dr. Burhan Metin for their moral and financial support that they provided us. These two person gave us hope about our future and promoted our willing to serve our country with science. 
We also would like to thank Prof. Dr. ErtuğrulKaraçuha for his assistance on providing us simulation time sponsorship from the UHeM Supercomputer at Istanbul Technical University, and we are grateful to Dr. KadirDiri for introducing supercomputers to us.
Literature: 
In this project, sensor parts for our biosensor derived from 2 main work;
Firstly, binding of methamphetamine to the alpha synuclein protein reported by the Dr. Omid Tavassoly and Dr. Jeremy S. Lee in their study titled as “Methamphetamine binds to alpha synuclein and causes conformational change”. Secondly, anti-METH antibody that we use as the base of our second plan of the project developed by Peterson et al. and reports about design and affinity improvement of that single chain antibody reported in different journals. We use the idea that single chain antibodies can be used for FRET (Fluorescence resonance energy transfer) studies and tried to apply this method for the methamphetamine detection. We are grateful for the contributors of these two projects for providing such a chance for the synthetic biology developers by their research. 
Artists/Designers:
Our lovely Meth Busters cartoon drawn by a talented artist from Calluna Design Studio, also a molecular biologist,FundaBüyükbaş, and our team logo designed and drawn by SerdarErbay. We are very grateful for these two artists for their work and the design that they add to our project.
Last but not least, we are very thankful to the web designer and our “çavo” Musa KorayAkpınar for his work to build our website.
