As students of Bio Engineering, to serve humanity in the medical field strike us at the drop of  a hat. In our project we optimize the detection of Cancer in a hand held  minimally invasive chip with an immobilized DNA that is complementary to MALAT 1 and  a biomarker called Biodipy.
PROJECT MOTIVATION:
When we conducted a survey on Cancer we were shocked that 80% of people in rural areas  think that cancer detection and cure, costs an arm and a leg. This motivated us to develop a  device that can detect cancer accurately and at the same time cost effective. Our personal  contact with the Cancer Institute gave us the necessary boost up to materialise our idea.
BACKGROUND:
MALAT 1 gene produces a precursor transcript from which a long non-coding RNA is  derived by RNase P cleavage of a tRNA-like small ncRNA (known as mascRNA) from its 3' end. The resultant mature transcript lacks a canonical poly (A) tail but is instead stabilized by  a 3' triple helical structure. This transcript is retained in the nucleus where it is thought to  form molecular scaffolds for ribonucleoprotein complexes. It may act as a transcriptional  regulator for numerous genes, including some genes involved in cancer metastasis and cell  migration, and it is involved in cell cycle regulation. Its upregulation in multiple cancerous  tissues has been associated with the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells.
HOW DID WE DO IT?
We designed a microfluidic chip using PDMS material which contains complementary DNA of 22 base pairs and a fluoromarker called Biodipy. The MALAT 1 amplified using E.Coli is fed into the channels of the chip which produces fluorescence whose intensity is proportional to cancer stages. We developed an algorithm for the intensity range for different stages of cancer.
