Register for iGem, have a great summer and attend the Giant Jamboree.✔
Meet all the deliverables.✔
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others , including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.✔
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry [link to our parts in igem registry] (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part main page. ✔
Silver
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.✔
Each part was validated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Individual proteins in the magnetosome collection was expressed, purified and validated using SDS-PAGE, UV-VIS absorbance spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (EM). In addition, and the amyloid collection (improvement BioBricks from 2015 team) was validated using congo-red plate assay and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university , or another institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem. ✔
We collaborated with Team UEA, whose Shewanella cells on difference surfaces we helped to imaged using AFM. We also suggested improvements for igemmatch.com to UC Davis.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate [link to human practices page] how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams' exemplary work).✔
We have identified human practice questions by quantitative topic modelling. We have also engaged with a range of education and public perception activities during our project.
Gold
Three criteria were met:
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. ✔
We performed quantitative topic modelling to determine trends within the science and the human practices in synthetic biology, as well as human practice aspects of past iGem teams. Through our analysis and visualization of bulk data, new connections were made between previous projects their human practices and our project. We then used the results of our topic modelling to feedback and sculpt the focus of our project.
Improve the function or characterisation of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry. Please see the registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part. This part must NOT be from your 2016 part number range. ✔
We improved the function of the parts made by Team Kent 2015 by altering the sequence of their BioBricks and changing promoter of their composite parts. In addition, our project also represent an significant improvement to Magnetosome BioBricks in past iGem project to date.
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a biobrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept. ✔
We have constructed a biobrick device, part BBa_K1985009, which is a device construct of expressing the proteins mamO mamP mamX and mamT.
