Mag-nano-tite: Creating magnetite nanoparticles in E.coli
Bacteria such as Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense grow magnetite nanoparticles that they use for orientation.
These magnetic nanoparticles are grown from iron inside of organelle-like structures called magnetosomes. In this project, we will use a synthetic biology approach to produce magnetite nanoparticles; utilising enzymes involved in magnetosome formation. We will utilise proteins MamP, MamT, MamO and MamX, which were chosen due to their proposed involvement in promoting magnetite crystal maturation in M. gryphiswaldense. The proteins will also be purified and tested in vitro.
Our results will further our understanding of how bacterial cells are able to form and organise magnetite nanoparticles in magnetosomes. Futhermore, we will demonstrate how synthetic biological approaches can be used to make nano-materials.
