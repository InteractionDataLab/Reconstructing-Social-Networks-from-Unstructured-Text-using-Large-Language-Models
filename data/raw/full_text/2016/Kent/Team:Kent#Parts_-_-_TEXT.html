Overview
Seventeen biobricks were produced, in two part collections, one a magnetosome collection and the other an amyloid collection. The majority of the parts were cloned into the pSB1C3 backbone using either Gibson assembly or restriction enzyme ligations. Some of parts were cloned into pSB1A3 because a co-transformation with a chloramphenicol resistant plasmid containing a cytochrome maturation factor is required for the parts to function, or because they needed to be transformed into VS45 E. coli strain that also contains a chloramphenicol resistant plasmid. The genes were initially cloned into plasmids containing an RFP indicator (BBa_JJ04450), which allowed for easy visualisation of correct colonies.
