Team Kent along with our advisers decided on our project. After a series of brainstorming sessions, we decided on 
a project aimed to synthesise magnetite nanoparticles in <I>E. coli</I>
‘Mag-nano-tite’ was chosen. We felt that this would be a relevant project based on current research, that
explores the numerous applications for magnetic nanoparticles including waste or heavy metal removal and drug delivery
(Kumari et al 2015) (Berry et al 2003) (Estelrich et al 2015). We saw that some bacteria synthesise
magnetosomes which are organelles that contain and synthesis magnetite crystals. Through our research we
discovered Mam genes, these are a group of genes which encode proteins that aid in magnetite crystal
formation (Schüler 2007). The limited literature on these encoded proteins eventually became a focus in
our project.
</P><H1 class="first_title">Modelling</H1><P>
We have introduced a new type of mathematical modelling; this novel Big Data topic modelling
approach has been introduced to iGEM for the purpose of human practices. Kritam, a team member, used topic
modelling to uncover thematic structure in document collections. This provided a simple way to analyse
large volumes of unlabelled text.
</P><H1 class="first_title">Wet Lab</H1><P>
Eight of the ten Team Kent members for iGEM this year are bioscience or chemistry students. Rita,
Braulio, Jasmine, Sam, Hanya, Andrew, Rachel and Daniie together underwent a learning experience in the
wet-lab. Together they carried out a vast range of experiments which included Gibson Assembly, PCR
(Polymerase Chain Reaction), Ligation, TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) and AFM (Atomic Force
Microscopy) imaging.
</P><P>
Protocols, experiments and results can be viewed <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Kent/Description">here</A>.
</P><H1 class="first_title">Integrated Human Practices</H1><P>
Human practices were explored by several members of Team Kent. Kritam, Braulio and Rita visited a
secondary school to educate pupils about synthetic biology here, we gained perspective and external opinions 
on Mag-nano-tite. This provided a wider picture on the synthesis of our magnetite nano-particles which we had 
not previously considered synthesising chemically. Rachel, Braulio, Jasmine and Sam were ambassadors for iGEM 
at open days for University ofKent. Here, the team interacted with the public, shared our project ideas as well 
educating many on the iGEM competition. Daniie interviewed an expert in the magnetic nanoparticle area, who provided
insight into the chemical synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles. Kritam, through topic modelling provided
a novel means for quantify human practices in iGEM.
More information on Human Practices can be found <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Kent/Human_Practices">here</A>.
</P><H1 class="first_title">Writing</H1><P>
Throughout the course of our iGEM project the Kent team have been carrying out research including
reading related articles to our project. We have discovered that there is not a lot of background
information on our chosen project, as well as lack of information on the proteins we have decided to
engineer. We have had weekly meetings where we discuss, share thoughts and ideas, as well as
make decisions for the benefit of this group. We have recorded the progress of this project in our
notebook which can be found here. (hyperlink to notebook)
We have designed posters, prepared presentations and written detailed explanations into our
project that the whole team has contributed to. The wiki was organised by our team
organiser Rachel, and coded by Aleksandra.
</P><H1 class="first_title">The Team</H1><H1 class="sub_titles">Kritam Thapa</H1><P>
Kritam’s main contributions was as a member of the Human Practice team. He was involved in the
outreach aspect of the project. He gave an oral presentation at an outstanding school where he shared and received
ideas from the students. Key information gathered from this event has proven central in some decisions
we have made in the development of the project. Kritam developed the modelling for our project, he also wrote code for
software to be used for the quantitative analysis for integrated human practice via LDA topic modelling.
</P><H1 class="sub_titles">Daniie Smith</H1><P>
Daniie’s main contributions to the team were as a wet lab member as well as her work for Human
Practices. Her work provided a unique angle to this project which allowed us to investigate into alternate methods to
chemically synthesise of magnetite nanoparticles. Daniie spoke to experts
in the nanoparticle field which gave us crucial insight into the field, this made her a
valuable member of the policy and practice team. As a wet lab team member her main contributions
were in PCR and the EM imaging of nanoparticles.
</P><H1 class="sub_titles">Andrew Seaton</H1><P>
Andrew’s main contributions was as a member of the wet lab team and as a member of ‘The Protein
Team’, carrying out the expressions of our proteins as well as the extraction and purification of our
proteins. Andrew was involved in the validation of our proteins using SDS PAGE and photospectrometry.
</P><H1 class="sub_titles">Samantha Weetman</H1><P>
Sam’s main contributions was as a member of the wet lab team. She was a member of ‘The Protein Team’,
carrying out the expressions of our proteins as well as the extraction and purification of our proteins.
Sam was also involved in the characterisation and validation of our proteins using SDS PAGE and
photospectrometry.
</P><H1 class="sub_titles">Aleksandra Zawlocka</H1><P>
Aleksandra’s main contributions to our project were as the designer of our team identity, and she coded our wiki page. She
expertly designed our logos, wrote code and prepared several visual assets for our page. Aleksandra also
designed our posters and our team banner.
</P><H1 class="sub_titles">Jazzy Cornish</H1><P>
Jasmine’s main contributions to the team were as a wet lab member, in BioBrick construction and
outreach. She used restriction enzyme cutting, Gibson assembly and ligation techniques to construct
several of our BioBricks. Jasmine was part of the outreach team, where she attended speaking
engagements at the University of Westminster and Kent, engaging with the public and fellow iGEM
competitors. Jasmine also engaged in the improvement of previous project.
</P><H1 class="sub_titles">Braulio Carrillo</H1><P>
Braulio’s contributions to the team was as a wet lab member, he was involved in human practices and
collaboration. Braulio was involved in the in vitro and in vivo protein expression, purification and
imaging. Braulio was a key member of the human practices team, attending speaking engagements at
Simon Langton Grammar School, University of Kent and the University of Westminster. 
Braulio will also present at the iGEM jamboree and was involved in the Team Kent iGEM
collaboration with UEA.
</P><H1 class="sub_titles">Rita Adriani</H1><P>
Rita was a key member of the wet lab team, using ligation, Gibson assembly to form viable BioBricks as
Rita also contributed to the improvement of a previous iGEM project. Rita was a member of the human
practices team, she attended speaking engagements at Simon Langton Grammar School, University of
Kent and the University of Westminster where she also presented.
</P><H1 class="sub_titles">Hanya Benotmane</H1><P>
Hanya’s main contributions were as the social media secretary for Mag-nano-tite. She was in charge of
all social media outlets where she continually interacted with other iGEM teams around the world. As a
result, Hanya led the collaboration for our team. She organised the collaboration with UEA, where she
analysed samples for their project using AFM. She also worked with UC Davis collaborating on ideas for
their website iGEMMatch.org. Hanya was also a wet lab member, involved in the AFM imaging of our
samples as well as that of a previous iGEM project, she was also involved in human practices.
</P><H1 class="sub_titles">Rachel Adeyemi</H1><P>
Rachel’s main contribution to this project was as the organiser/team secretary. Rachel contributed as
the safety officer, completing the safety documentation required for our project as well as ensuring the
lab environment remained conducive for safe work. Rachel contributed with her writing, she aided in
the organisation of our wiki, notebook and documented our weekly meetings and brainstorming
sessions. Rachel was also a wet lab member undergoing techniques such as Gibson assembly and protein
validation. Rachel was involved in human practices where she attended speaking engagements at the
University of Kent.
