            notorious for its unsanitary, unsafe condition</STRONG>; it
            consecutively fails government-mandated water quality tests and is
            deemed to have five times the amount of bacteria that would be
            considered safe for human contact. The contemporary ailments of the
            Harbor can be accredited to an ill-maintained sewage system,
            followed by the perpetuated cycle of littering.</P><P>Of all the pollutants that afflict our bodies of water, arguably
            the most notorious is plastic. Data acquired by the Ocean
            Crusaders Foundation disclosed that 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic
            debris are situated in the ocean. Of that mass,
            269,000 tons float on the surface, while some four billion plastic
            microfibers per square kilometer litter the deep sea.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><P>In terms of collateral damage, approximately 100,000 marine
            creatures and 1 million sea birds are found dead each year due to plastic
            entanglement and subsequent suffocation. Additionally, toxins from
            decomposed plastic are introduced into ecological systems that humans
            often manipulate for food.</P><P>A biological approach to resolving this problem is favorable
            because of its practicality and efficiency. Other approaches to
            achieving our goal would be costly, as manual labor would have to
            be largely effectuated to cover the massive amount of space.
            Inspired by bacteria with an unprecedented ability, Ideonella
            sakaiensis, that naturally decomposes polyethylene terephthalate,
            we decided to genetically modify E. coli cells to model the
            plastic degradation process; we did this by adding the Lipase and
            Chlorogenate Esterase genes from Ideonella sakaiensis into E. coli bacterial cells.</P><P>With the engineered E. coli bacteria, the enzymes introduced are able to express the plastic-decomposing proteins and
            their cleansing properties can be effectively distributed
            throughout substantial bodies of water. This particular proposition
            can realistically be executed because of the minimal effort and
            financial advantage it presents. Contemporary government-enacted
            programs are somewhat effective in clearing up water pollution but an estimated $44,000,000.00 is annually required to
            sustain these efforts; if successful, the possibilities and
            possible applications of our system are endless! Manipulating E. coli for the
            treatment of pollution would be elementary, as their procreation
            would ensure the continuity of the genetically engineered
            genes.</P><P>With this being said, in terms of applications, our genetically
            engineered E. coli has the potential to change the way plastic is
            disposed of for the foreseeable future. Our bacteria could be
            incorporated into a filtration system built onto the bottom of a
            boat, installed so that it resides in a
            recycling-bin/garbage-disposal specialized for PET plastics, or
            even cultured so that it can reside within the confinement of
            industrial plants for the quick degeneration of excess plastic.
            Additionally, the remnants of such process can be manipulated for
            use as a precursor for a multitude of uses- primarily creating fuel. The
            possibilities are endless!.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
