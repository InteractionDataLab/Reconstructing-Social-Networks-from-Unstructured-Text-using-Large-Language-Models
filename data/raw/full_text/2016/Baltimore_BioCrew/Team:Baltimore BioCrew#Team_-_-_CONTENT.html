I'm currently a senior at Western High School and aspire to practice Pediatric Medicine. I am extremely passionate about biology and love appreciating all the things we customarily take for granted. I was born in the New York metropolitan region, but have Brazilian roots. I'm also a MERIT scholar and enjoy spending time with my pets, playing the piano, and eating Italian food.
      </P></DIV><DIV class="row m-t-1 m-l-1"><P class="col-md-10"><B>Ella Coleman</B> I am homeschooled and currently a junior.  I am fascinated by biology and have loved working in the lab ever since I started in high school classes at CCBC. My favorite activities are knitting, practicing martial arts, and playing the guitar.
      </P></DIV><DIV class="row m-t-1 m-l-1"><P class="col-md-10"><B>Oumaima Driwech</B> I am a junior currently attending Baltimore Polytechnic Institute who wishes to become a Bio-Chemist within the future. I am from Casablanca, Morocco. Although I am not from Baltimore, I grew up within that venue at the age of one on up. I would always travel to the harbor every Sunday, as if it were a ritual, along with my family. The harbor united my family as I am sure it did to others and seeing the harbor decay over time sparked a sense of sadness within me. Being apart of this program allows me to help discover a solution to this conflict and to, one day, rejoice at the harbor with purity and cleanliness.

Baltimore is my hometown and I consider it to be my safe haven. As someone who wants to make a difference in my community and is in love with the brainâ€™s complexity, I aspire to be a pediatric surgeon.
