Project Description
The water that constitutes the Baltimore City Harbor is             notorious for its unsanitary, unsafe condition; it             consecutively fails government-mandated water quality tests and is             deemed to have five times the amount of bacteria that would be             considered safe for human contact. The contemporary ailments of the             Harbor can be accredited to an ill-maintained sewage system,             followed by the perpetuated cycle of littering.
Of all the pollutants that afflict our bodies of water, arguably             the most notorious is plastic. Data acquired by the Ocean             Crusaders Foundation disclosed that 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic             debris are situated in the ocean. Of that mass,             269,000 tons float on the surface, while some four billion plastic             microfibers per square kilometer litter the deep sea.
In terms of collateral damage, approximately 100,000 marine             creatures and 1 million sea birds are found dead each year due to plastic             entanglement and subsequent suffocation. Additionally, toxins from             decomposed plastic are introduced into ecological systems that humans             often manipulate for food.
A biological approach to resolving this problem is favorable             because of its practicality and efficiency. Other approaches to             achieving our goal would be costly, as manual labor would have to             be largely effectuated to cover the massive amount of space.             Inspired by bacteria with an unprecedented ability, Ideonella             sakaiensis, that naturally decomposes polyethylene terephthalate,             we decided to genetically modify E. coli cells to model the             plastic degradation process; we did this by adding the Lipase and             Chlorogenate Esterase genes from Ideonella sakaiensis into E. coli bacterial cells.
With the engineered E. coli bacteria, the enzymes introduced are able to express the plastic-decomposing proteins and             their cleansing properties can be effectively distributed             throughout substantial bodies of water. This particular proposition             can realistically be executed because of the minimal effort and             financial advantage it presents. Contemporary government-enacted             programs are somewhat effective in clearing up water pollution but an estimated $44,000,000.00 is annually required to             sustain these efforts; if successful, the possibilities and             possible applications of our system are endless! Manipulating E. coli for the             treatment of pollution would be elementary, as their procreation             would ensure the continuity of the genetically engineered             genes.
With this being said, in terms of applications, our genetically             engineered E. coli has the potential to change the way plastic is             disposed of for the foreseeable future. Our bacteria could be             incorporated into a filtration system built onto the bottom of a             boat, installed so that it resides in a             recycling-bin/garbage-disposal specialized for PET plastics, or             even cultured so that it can reside within the confinement of             industrial plants for the quick degeneration of excess plastic.             Additionally, the remnants of such process can be manipulated for             use as a precursor for a multitude of uses- primarily creating fuel. The             possibilities are endless!.
