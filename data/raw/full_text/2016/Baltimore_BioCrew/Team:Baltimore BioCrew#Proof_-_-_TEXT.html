A Functional Proof of Concept for the Baltimore BioCrew's BioBrick Device
Based upon our rigorous research efforts, our proof of concept is based upon the meticulous construction of our BioBricks, one of which being the BioBrick for the lipase gene (BBa_K2187001). This BioBrick serves to replace MHETASE, a distinguishing enzyme which gives Ideonella sakaiensis it’s renowned plastic-degrading properties. The other enzyme that fulfills and progresses this property is called PETASE, which we substituted with the Chlorogenate Esterase gene (BBa_K2187001).
With the 2 known plastic-degrading enzymes of Ideonella sakaiensis being substituted with our BioBricks, which serve identical functions, our team believes that this is enough to prove that our genetic modification will work.
We know that Lipase and Chlorogenate Esterase will serve to replace the 2 genes that are unable to physically acquire, so with this is mind, we used the predetermined Prefix/Suffix, Promoter, RBS, and Terminator to build our BioBricks off of. Once we had the forward and reverse primers included into our gene sequence, we had the complete set of nucleotides with all fulfilled requirements; with this, we used these BioBricks and transformed them into E. coli cells through a plasmid. The antibiotic resistance segregated our transformed cells, and with this, our E. coli cells should be capable of expressing the said enzymes that instigate the decomposition of PET and MHET plastics.
From transforming our E. coli cells to express our MHETASE and PETASE substitutes, we are hopeful that our results are in accordance with our hypothesis.
