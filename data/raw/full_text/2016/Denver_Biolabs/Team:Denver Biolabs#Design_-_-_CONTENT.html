    As our team began our oxytocin-focused project, we began thinking about ways to
    grow and sustain a yeast-based diagnostic system in the rural areas we are focused on.
    This challenge led us to design and build a system for drying our oxytocin-reporter yeast
    into a powdered form that could be reconstituted on site similar to baker's or brewer's yeast.

    The concept and design of the spray dryer is based on the industrial systems used to
    produce large quantities of baker's and brewer's yeast. Pictured below is a general design
    of an industrial yeast dryer.
    <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p24t77zkNvw"><I>Photo credit: Arjun Ghimire</I></A>
    Liquid culture is piped through an atomizer at the top of the
    column. Hot air is simultaneously vented into the column, and a third inlet to column vents
    air to create a vortex inside. As the liquid culture passes through the hot air column, evaporative cooling
    prevents the cells from experiencing the direct and fatal heat within the column. The dried
    yeast falls to the bottom of the column and is collected, while the excess air is vented out.

    To operate our fully assembled yeast dryer, you will need a ladder, two blow dryers, a power strip, liquid yeast culture, and an air compressor
    to provide the pressure for the airgun. Cut a small hole in the bottom of the liquid media bottle and epoxy a piece of tubing with the airgun attachment
    on the other end into the hole (let dry). Fill the media bottle with liquid yeast culture, turn on the air compressor (hooked up to the airgun on the top
    of the column/vortex). Turn on both blow dryers - one venting into the top heating manifold, and one venting into the vacuum attachment on the column/vortex.
    We found that the &quot;warm&quot; setting on high for the blow-dryer blowing into the vacuum attachment and high, hot setting on the heating manifold blow-dryer
    worked the best. Take your liquid media bottle with airgun attachment and ascend the ladder. Attach the bottle to the airgun and start spraying! It took
    approximately 2 bottles of media to get a sizeable quantity of dried yeast in to the collection bottle. Note: We also tried to avoid static electricity buildup
    by grounding our column to the building. We also insultated the column with space-blanket-like material to reduce the dried yeast powder from sticking to the
    inside of the column.

  </P><H2>Next Steps and Future Improvements</H2><P class="main">
    We found that vast majority of the yeast powder was sticking to the inside of the column. To avoid this in future iterations, we would explore using higher
    velocity and hotter air in the heating manifold and the column. We would also insert acrylic windows into the column so we could watch the activity inside
    the column during test runs. In the photo, we have a weight holding the stand down, which worked well for our prototype, but in future iterations of the
    dryer stand, we would use a more sturdy design. We also noticed during our test runs that the vacuum bag on the exhaust manifold collected quite a bit of
    yeast, so a second powder separation column should be added to future designs of this dryer.
    
    With the airbrush we used - a Master Airbrush S62 model - we found that the 0.5mm nozzle worked the best. The 0.7mm nozzle sprayed too much liquid, and contributed
    to a lot of the yeast sticking to the sides of the column.
    
    Another improvement to the dryer we would make is to add thermisters throughout the system so that we could better record and regulate the temperature
    at different points in the drying process. And finally, we would explore different coatings for the inside of the column that could help prevent
    the yeast from getting stuck to the insides of the column.
    
    After constructing a functional dryer with the improvements listed above, we would also conduct viability
    tests at various time-intervals to determine how long our dried yeast could survive in heat-sealed foil
    packets - our intended modality for shipping and transport of the yeast reporters.
