From healthcare to energy production, climate change to global hunger –       synthetic biology offers dramatically new methods to address our planet's       largest problems. Recent advancements in synthetic biology mean that the       limiting factors to progress are increasingly becoming creativity and ingenuity.       Denver Biolabs is a community of interdisciplinary individuals - biologists,       engineers, artists, computer scientists, and entrepreneurs - committed to       working at these intersections to create solutions to pressing problems.
