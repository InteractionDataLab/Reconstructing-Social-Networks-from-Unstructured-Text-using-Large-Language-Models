BBa_K2111000
RI7_FLAG_OXTR:           This part is a chimeric receptor with a FLAG tag. It is composed of the ligand binding domain of the human oxytocin receptor,           flanked by the N and C termini of the rat RI7 olfactory receptor. It was designed using the DIY receptor design guide created           by the 2012 TU Delft iGEM team (https://2012.igem.org/Team:TU-Delft/receptordesign). This part is intended to express in the           membrane of a yeast cell and - upon oxytocin ligand binding - activate the mating pathway and the inducible FUS1 promotor.           This allows us to leverage a reporter protein under control of FUS1 to detect the presence of oxytocin.
BBa_K2111001
PGK1_OXTR:             This is a composite of the PGK1 promoter (BBa_K1652000) and RI7_FLAG_OXTR (BBa_K2111000). The PGK1 (pPGK1Gx) is a S. cerevisiae optimized constitutive promoter to facilitate the expression of RI7_FLAG_OXTR.
BBa_K2111002
FUS1 Promoter:             The FUS1 promoter is from the yeast mating pathway. It is induced with pheromones from the opposite mating type.
BBa_K2111003
FUS1_AmilCP:       This is a composite of the FUS1 promoter (BBa_K2111002) and amilCP blue chromoprotein (BBa_K592009). It is a reporter part used to visualize activation of the yeast mating pathway.
BBa_K2111004
FUS1_RFP:     This is a composite of the FUS1 promoter (BBa_K2111002) and RFP (BBa_E1010). It is a reporter part used to visualize activation of the yeast mating pathway.
BBa_K2111005
FUS1_iLOV:     This is a composite of the FUS1 promoter (BBa_K2111002) and iLOV (BBa_K660004). It is a reporter part used to visualize activation of the yeast mating pathway.
