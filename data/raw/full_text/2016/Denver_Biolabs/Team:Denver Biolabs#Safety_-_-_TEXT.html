General Safety
Our lab is classified as a BSL-1 laboratory. This is the     lowest biosafety level. Our lab works with reagents and organisms that pose a     minimal threat to our members. Research in our lab is performed on open lab     benches. Lab members have received individual training in:
* General Lab Safety
* Sterile Technique
* Proper Chemical Handling
* Proper PPE
* Waste Management
* Autoclave Training
All biological organisms used are classified as biosafety     level 1 organisms and are non-pathogenic, meaning they will not cause disease     in healthy adults. Organisms were used under well-established protocols.
Strains used:
* Escherichia coli K-12
* Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4742
Safety at Denver Biolabs
 
All experiments and operations in our lab were in compliance     with Environmental     Health and Safety Guidelines at the University of Colorado-Denver.  The PI provided training to each     individual lab member and access to the lab is limited to those who have successfully     completed training. Training required lab members to complete this     form .
 
1.    Personal     Safety: Each lab member wore gloves, safety glasses (if needed), closed     toed shoes, and long pants when working in the lab to avoid chemical exposure.     Each lab member was trained in determining the appropriate PPE needed to safely     perform an experiment. No food or beverage consumption was allowed inside the     lab. 
 
2.    Sterilizing     workspace: Lab benches were cleaned with 70% EtOH before and after each experiment. All waste generated was disposed of in     appropriate containers. Biological waste was autoclaved before disposal. All     glassware, pipette tips, and many reagents were autoclaved prior to use.
 
3.     Recombinant DNA: Proper precaution must     be taken when working with recombinant DNA. Our lab adheres to the NIH     Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid     Molecules .
