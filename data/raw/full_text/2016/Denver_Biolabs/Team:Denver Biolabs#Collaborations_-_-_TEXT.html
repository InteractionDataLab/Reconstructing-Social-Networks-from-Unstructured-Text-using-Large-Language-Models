Collaborations
Denver Biolabs collaborated with both the Colorado State University and     University of Colorado Boulder by providing a space and community audience     to present the iGEM work being done in Colorado to a broad audience. In addition     to being an opportunity for all of our teams to practice our Jamboree presentations,     it facilitated networking between our institutions, served as a community outreach     and educational event, and helped the University teams identify lab space and project     mentorship resources through Denver Biolabs that can facilitate their ongoing     involvement in synthetic biology post-graduation.
