We have many sponsors that we would like to thank. We would not have been able to accomplish nearly as much as we did this summer without their support!
First, we would like to thank WPI's Biology and Biotechnology Department. Due to their support, we always had a fully stocked lab with everything we needed to accomplish our goals this summer.
We would also like to thank Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) for 20kb of free sequencing. Their kindness proved to be integral to the completion of our project.
Last but certainly not least, we would like to thank GenScript for their $2000 grant for CRISPR technology. This grant helped us to ensure that we had everything we needed to complete our project.
