This RNA based gene editing system, holds promise for a more accurate and efficient form of gene therapy. By editing the mRNA of cells, there are no repair mechanisms that could reverse the changes. At the same time, the effects of this editing system can be controlled using outside medications (using doxycycline to control expression of the genes containing the editing system) and are made only to mRNA, leaving the DNA genome alone. There is also the issue of editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system causing unwanted or off target mutations. These mutations could cause problems for the cells ranging from cell death to cancer. Though more accurate CRISPR/Cas9 DNA based systems have been created, the chance for permanent off target mutations is still present. Fundamentally, this RNA based gene therapy dodges the main issue of off target cuts and mutations to the genome. In targeting mRNA, the dCas9 does not cut the mRNA, but acts like a delivery platform carrying enzymes. The tetracycline control of the editing system can also be used to stop any unwanted/off target changes from persisting in mRNA. 
The proposed dCas9 based RNA editing system, if functional, can be treated like other gene therapy treatments. The DNA used for the system will be transported into target cells using specifically created associated adeno-viral vectors, injected directly into the area of the target cells or to the blood system if the target cells are all over the body(such as the nervous system)<SUP>1</SUP>. So far there has been only one case when adenovirus as a vector has caused the determent of the patient. This accident occurred when the viruses started targeting non-target cells causing a reactionary immune response, resulting in coma and death of the patient.<SUP>2</SUP> Because of this, a more commonly used vector called Adeno-Associated Virus will be used to transport the DNA used in this editing system.<B><U>Failsafes and TroubleShooting</U></B>
	The next problem that could occur with our RNA based gene therapy system is the potential mutation to the DNA that codes for the editing system. The solution to a mutant of our system could be addressed simply by the patient to stop taking doxycycline, as the expression of the dCas9 system uses a Tet-on system, requiring the presence of tetracycline or a derivative (doxycycline).  However, if a mutation occurs that allows for the geneâ€™s expression without doxycycline, then a kill switch will be needed. One concept for a kill switch is the use of a separate section of DNA coding for another dCas9. This dCas9 would target the DNA sequence where transcription starts or some section of the gene containing the dCas9 of the RNA modifying machine. Experimentation has shown that dCas9 has a high efficiency rate at silencing its target gene.<SUP>3</SUP> Binding to the DNA will prevent or cause early termination of transcription, stopping the mutant gene from being expressed. Similarly, the dCas9 could be replaced with two active Cas9 molecules that could break or cut out a section of the mutated gene, breaking it.<SUP>4</SUP> Both of these systems could be controlled by another artificial molecule like CNO or another antibiotic.The downside to these systems is that, if the target DNA sequence of the silencing dCas9 or Cas9 molecules is mutated to a certain point, it may no longer be recognized by the silencing CRISPR/Cas9 molecule. To counter this problem, multiple Cas9 molecules targeting different parts of the gene of interest could be included, or have the Cas9 molecules target a specific sequence that the gene requires to allow transcription. Alternatively, the Cas9 systems could also be replaced with a Zinc Fingers based editing molecule, or even a repressor molecule that is activated by the presence of Tetracycline TetR.<SUP>5</SUP> Finally, the use of chimeric DNA MTases using Cys2His2 zinc finger systems can be potentially used to silence the gene of interest by methylating the promoter region. This would permanently silence the gene, while the other silencing methods can be reversed. It should be considered that this system could cause the unintentional silencing of other genes if the targeting sequence of system is mutated, causing further potential problems with the cell.<SUP>6</SUP> The last stage kill switch that could be applied can be best described as a scorched earth policy and should only be considered if the DNA being added to the target cells results in the development in cancerous cells. The kill switch could code for membrane proteins that signal the host's immune system to target the infected cell for apoptosis, or produce ion channels that disrupt chloride ion levels in the cells, causing their death.<SUP>7</SUP> This kill switch could cause the affected cells to die before any life threatening conditions occur. The most notable downside to this kill switch is that, if the kill switch DNA gets added to non-target cells, then it will cause unwanted cell death in cells that could cause serious harm to the patient. 
Another option to address a cancer type mutation in the target cell DNA, is the use of a marker. By including a section of DNA that produces an extremely small amounts of GFP or another biomarker, if the cells become cancerous and are mass producing proteins, the heightened levels of biomarker could both indicate the presence of a problem and indicate which cells are cancerous. The downside to this concept is that, the biomarker would have to be added to a section of DNA known to be over expressed in cancer cells for it to function as a cancer marker. Additionally, if the marker gene is overexpressed due to some other reason (such as a minor mutation) it would signal a false positive for a problem.<SUP>8</SUP>
In terms of delivery, the DNA containing the kill switch can be either administered to the cells in the same package as our gene editing system, or could be administered to the cells later if the need arises. Keeping the killswitch DNA with the gene of interest DNA ensures a high probability of the kill switch being present in the cells along with the gene of interest. This would allow for faster silencing of the gene of interest if needed. The downside to this plan is that, if the gene of interest is mutated, the kill switch DNA may also be mutated along with the gene of interest, potentially making it useless. The other option is adding the kill switch DNA to the cells later, when it is required due to a malfunction of the editing system that bypasses its tetracycline control. This allows the kill switch to not be activated until it is in the cells and protects it from any mutation. It also prevents the possibility of the kill switch being activated prematurely or unintentionally. However, by administering the kill switch later, there is a no guarantee that of the gene of interest will be silenced. The infection of the target cells with the kill switch would have about the same probability of success as the gene of interest, and there is no guarantee that all of the affected cells will get the kill switch containing DNA.<B><U>When and Where to Use it</U></B>
Overall, the usage of this RNA editing genetic therapy would be best utilized for non-developmental, somatic based, gene therapy. This system works best as a way to test potential gene therapy treatments by first applying it in somatic cells. These cells will potentially expressed the desired genes, but would only last as long as the cell lives. Once the cells die and are replaced, the editing genes that we are adding will be lost, due to difficulties in maintaining a stable line of cells that will not stop expressing the added genes. This would require an additional treatments of the therapy. Additionally, this system uses doxycycline to allow the expression of the editing system. Long term usage of doxycycline can potentially cause the development of doxycycline resistant diseases in the patient, and can cause other side well known minor side effects. These factors combined indicate that this system would be best suited as a tester gene therapy, where in, it can be used to determine if a proposed gene therapy change will cause the desired outcome, before being administered using DNA based changes. Germline based therapy, besides being a largely debated ethical topic, would not be an efficient use of this editing system. The main purpose of this gene therapy is to allow for the stopping of the genetic changes. Most importantly, this system works using a Tet-on regulation system. Doxycycline is known to have toxic effects on skeletal development in fetuses, and its administration is usually stopped by the patient unless it is crucial for survival. Even if other regulation systems are used, the effects of the gene therapy would have to be monitored constantly in the developing fetus, to observe if the change is occurring as desired or if other complications are occurring. However, this system, having its expression controlled by outside signals, allows for developmental therapies. Germ-line therapy is out of the question for genetic editing, but this system could be used to target a gene used for early development in patients (fetus and adolescent) that is not used or required during later stage maturation. A gene used during early development could be repaired, and then later down the line, the treatments can be stopped, potentially allowing fetuses (that were previously unviable) to be viable and become able to fully develop into children. Germ-line gene editing is still a topic of ethical debate due to the unknown effects of manipulating the genetics that become part of the gene pool. The genome within the germ line cells is passed down to offspring, meaning any change done in Germ-line gene therapy will be carried on, for better or worse. Editing could cause a decrease in genetic variance among populations, and could cause other unforeseen problems in the future that no one currently can predict accurately. <U>References</U></P><OL><LI>
