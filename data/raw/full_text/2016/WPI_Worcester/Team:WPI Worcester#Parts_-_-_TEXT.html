The Registry of Standard Biological Parts makes over 5,000 unique parts available. There are parts for all projects from promoters to reporters, and primers to coding regions. This year the WPI 2016 iGEM team is helping to grow the registry's database by contributing 16 parts. These parts included different parts of the editing system the team designed, the reporter proteins the system was going to be tested on, and the guide RNA used to help guide the editing system to its target mRNA.
