Counting Cells
Split cells if necessary
Pipette 10 μL of cells into microcentrifuge tube
Add 10 μL of trypan blue to the microcentrifuge tube (mix together by pipetting up and down)
Wipe down counting grid and cover with ethanol
Take 10 μL of cell and trypan blue mixture and place in grid (make sure there are no bubbles and the mixture spreads over the grid)
Check under the microscope and count cells in corner boxes and center box
Cell count should be between 100 and 500 cells
Multiply total cells by 4000 to get number of cells/mL
Multiply the number of wells plus one by the concentration you want
Divide the number found in #8  by the number of cells/mL (found in #7) to find the amount of cell mixture needed
Subtract the amount of cell mixture needed (answer from #9) from the number of wells plus one to find the amount of media needed
Create the correct mixture needed from your calculations
Pipette 1 mL into each well
Incubate
DMEM Media:
100 mL of Media Composition
88% DMEM - 88 mL
10% FBS - 10mL
1% Glutamine - 1mL
1% PS - 1ml
eGFP ACG/ATG Transfection:
12 Well DNA Transfection Protocol for each 3 well column
CaPhos-DNA Mix
20 μL 2.5 M CaCl2
4 μg total DNA (3 μg eGFP DNA, 1 ug RFP)
GFP: Use either pEGFPN3 -> 3 μg = 4.62 μL or pEGFPC1 -> 3 μg = 3.42 μL or ATGeGFP -> 3 μg = 4.47 μL or ACGeGFP -> 3 μg = 4.2 uL
RFP: Use PTagRFPC -> 1 μg = 1.14 μL
Dilute to 200 μL with 0.1X TE
Pipet up and down to mix
Add 1 equal volume (200 μL) of 2X HBS solution
Pipet up and down to mix (volume of tube is now 400 uL)
Incubate at room temp for 1 min
Add carefully 100 μL each to 3 wells (this will be 1 μg total DNA per well)
Incubate for 2-6 hours in 37 degree incubator
Mammalian Cell Transfection
Add 50µL 2.5M CaPhos to a 1.5mL eppendorf tube
Add a total of 10µg DNA (5µg RFP, 5µg GFP)
Add 0.1xTE to a total volume of 500µL
Add 500µL 2xHBS, pipette up and down to mix, sit for about 1 minute
Add appropriate amount to each well, do not mix
Microscopy:
Fixing Cells
Steps 1-3 should be done in the sterile culture hood
Aspirate off media and replace with 1x PBS (remove media and add PBS slowly from the side of the wells as not to disrupt cells)
Aspirate off PBS
Add 0.5 mL of 4% PFA (in 1x PBS) (this is the fixing agent)
Put cells on a shaker with a non-transparent cover (to prevent bleaching of the biomarkers) for 10 minutes since the addition of the PFA
Steps 5-7 should be done inside the chemical fume hood
Remove as much PFA from the wells and put in special waste bottle
Rinse with PBS and discard that into same waste bottle
Add about 1 mL of PBS into each well (be sure to not add directly to well to not disturb cells
Place wells under cover until they are mounted
Mounting Cells
Add one drop of polyvinyl mounting solution (specially made) on glass slide for each coverslip of cells being placed on the slide
Use tweezers to extract coverslip out of well, dab side of slip on paper towel to get off excess PBS, and place slip cell side down onto the drop of mounting solution
Press slip gently onto mounting solution to get rid of air bubbles
Use kim wipe and firmly press straight down onto slide with slips to squeeze out excess mounting solution (be sure to press evenly and try not to move slip around when pressing)
Spray DI water against slide around the coverslips and press again with a kimwipe to remove excess mounting solution
Cover from light to prevent bleaching, and let dry for about an hour
Miniprep:
Spin liquid culture at 3,000 rpm for 10 min
Discard the liquid
Add 250 µL A1 to re-suspend the cells
Draw up all the cells, and place in a centrifuge tube
Add 250 µL A2, mix
Add 300 µL A3
When the color is gone, spin at max speed for 10 min
Load supernatant in a column places over another tube
Spin at max speed for 1 min. Discard the liquid
Add 600 µL A4, spin for 30s
Discard the liquid, and spin for 1 min
Place the column in a new centrifuge tube, add 50 µL elution buffer, and let rest at RT for 1 min
Spin for 1 min
PCR:
PCR Mixture:
22.5 µL ddH20
1.25 µL 10nM Primer (3’)
1.25 µL 10nM Primer (5’)
100 ng/µL DNA Template
25 µL 2x PCR Master Mix
PCR Protocol:
95 ℃ 2 minutes
95 ℃ 30 seconds
50 ℃ 45 seconds
72 ℃ 4.5 minutes
Repeat 1-4 for 30 cycles
72 ℃ 10 minutes
Hold at 10 ℃ until needed
Splitting Cells
Splitting Cells of Adherent Cell Line
Aspirate off old media from culture
Add 3-4 mL of PBS
Swirl around PBS to cover all of the flask
Aspirate off PBS
Add 0.5 mL of Trypsin
Swirl around the flask and lightly strike the side of the flask to remove the cells from the flask (should see the cells sliding off the flask)
Add 6 mL of media to the flask and mix the solution by pipetting the media up and down
Doing so can break apart clumps of cells and allow for more even distribution
Place mixture into a sterile 15mL conical tube
Add required amount of cells and media needed for degree of split required to have a final volume of 6 mL into a new 250 mL flask (or to the original flask)

One Enzyme:
Add 16 µL deionized autoclaved H20

Thawing Cells Protocol:
5ml media then draw up the cell line into the same pipette
Slowly dispense into final tube. Mix lightly, let rest for a few minutes
Run through centrifuge at 800 RPM for 5 minutes
Pipette as much of it as you can off without disturbing the pellet of cells at the bottom of the tube
Dispose of old media in sterilized beaker
Flick the bottom of the tube to re-suspend the cells
Use approximately 6ml of media in the new flasks
Gently add and slowly pipette up and down in the tube. Pipette into the flask.
Label using ethanol resistant pen
