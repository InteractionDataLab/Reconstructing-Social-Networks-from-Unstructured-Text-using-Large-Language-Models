Hans Jacob is the team’s clown. He is 24 years old and comes from Oppegård in Norway. 
He sleeps through our meetings at 1 pm, and can’t make it to early meetings. 
Hans just learned how to skate, and we hold our breaths when he’s trying out new tricks. 
Despite this, Hans is taking his masters in Nanotechnology and he printed, designed and did some electric-stuff on our device.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4 right"><P><B>Ragnhild Bugge</B><I>Team Leader | Masters in Molecular Biology</I>
Ragnhild is our team leader. She is 24 years old and comes from a village called Vistdal. She has a difficult dialect which some team members find hard to understand. Ragnhild, Torleif and Marthe were the first who joined the team. They were classmates when writing their bachelors. She makes sure everybody is doing their assigned job and pushes us to deliver on due dates.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row subsite members"><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV class="col-md-3"><P><B>Paul Clarke</B><I>Team Member | Bachelor in Informatics</I>

It was funded in 1811 and has more than 27 000 students and 6000 employees. The University lies in the capital of Norway, Oslo, and the buildings are spread all over the city. But the largest part is located in a &quot;Blindern&quot;. We have our lab located at Blindern, Kristine Bonnevies house, Department of Biosciences.  
</P><P class="boxnotes leftext"> Oslo is the capital of Norway, but also Norway's largest city. It has more than 650 000 inhabitants; this include many students that move to Oslo to get an education. Students in Norway are very fortunate; We study for free! Everyone can get a scholarship or a student loan.</P><DIV id="collab"><H2 class="boxheader right">Collaborations</H2></DIV><P class="boxnotes rightext"><B>Collaboration with K-Res in Tromsø</B>
We were so fortunate to collaborate with scientists at the Center of National Expertise Service for the Detection of Antibiotic Resistance (K- res). We received clinical isolates of different ESBL-strains, accompanied with their ESBL-genes sequence information. These strains were used to test our detection method described in the “lab-section” of the wiki.</P><P class="boxnotes rightext"><B>Nordic iGEM Conference</B>
We joined the NiC which took part in the end of June 2016 in Stockholm. The conference was hosted by the winning team of last year NiC mini jamboree - iGEM Stockholm. Not only was this a great platform to exchange ideas between teams, but also a valuable social event where the Nordic teams also get to become friends. We attended workshop regarding ethics and speculative design where we at the latter got to think outside the box about synthetic biology. During the mini-jamboree we got valuable feedback from the judges, interesting question from the audience, and important experience by presenting our project. Good luck this year winner, iGEM Leiden, with hosting NiC next year! </P><P class="boxnotes rightext"><B>Norway iGEM Conference</B>
We initiated a mini-conference with the second Norwegian team, iGEM NTNU, 23-24th September. The conference was held at the Science Library at University of Oslo. We presented our projects in front of three judges that provided us with valuable feedback before the giant jamboree in Boston. </P><P class="boxnotes rightext">
The Norwegian Biotechnology Advisory Board attended our conference and we are scheduled to appear on their GENialt magazine website. We hope this is a beginning of a new tradition that the Norwegian teams of next year will honor and bring to the next level.   </P><P class="boxnotes rightext"><B>Collaboration with team iGEM NTNU  </B>
After learning more about each other project we were interested in figuring out how we could help each other out. We discussed at the Norway iGEM Conference about how we further could collaborate and both teams were interested to see if the results could be generated in another lab. </P><P class="boxnotes rightext">
We transformed TOP10 competent cells with plasmids (1-4) provided by the NTNU team. Preferably we should have transformed DH5α cells to meet NTNUs wishes, but we did not have these available in the lab at this point. We got instruction to plate the transformed cells on LB agar plates with ampicillin added. Unfortunately, not all transformations grew and we ended up with bacteria transformed with plasmid “1” and “4”.  </P><P class="boxnotes rightext"><B>Experimental setup: </B>
The NTNU team gave us guidelines of how to conduct the experiment. 
Grow overnight cultures with LB medium, ampicillin and one bacteria colony at 37°C.
Transfer the overnight culture to different incubation temperatures (30,37 and 41°C) and 200 rpm. This correlates to the experiment start point at 0 hours.    </P><P class="boxnotes rightext">
Check if there is any color change in the different temperature settings  </P><P class="boxnotes rightext"><B>Results:</B>
We did not observe any visible color change in any of the different setups with either plasmid “1” or “4”. 
 </P><P class="boxnotes rightext">
Team iGEM NTNU also helped us out by performing an experiment with our protocol regarding use of Nitrocefin to test ampicillin-resistant E. coli and regular E. coli without any antibiotic resistance. During our experiments, these bacteria have been our positive and negative control, respectively. By following our protocol and filling in a provided excel-sheet they provided us with data that resulted to this graph. Although operating with different scales, the data provided by the NTNU team shows the same trends as our data indicate. The values in this provided dataset is significantly higher, and this could for example be due to the sensitivity of the instruments(spectrophotometer) used.  </P><P class="boxnotes rightext lastp">
We want to thank team NTNU for the collaboration and a wonderful time at the first Norway iGEM Conference. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row footer"><DIV class="col-md-4 footerelement"><H2 class="boxheader footerheader">Contact</H2><P class="boxnotes footercontact"> Blindernveien 31, 0371 Oslo</P><P class="boxnotes footercontact"> uioslonorway@gmail.com</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
