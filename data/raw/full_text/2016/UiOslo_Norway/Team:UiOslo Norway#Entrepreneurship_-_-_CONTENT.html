Technology is changing rapidly. We believe, keeping up with these changes, will give valuable profit. Therefore our team have been seeking ways to transform processes by updating them with today's technology. We have created the elementary parts of an Android Application to show that one  process in the diagnostics field can be improved to enable more efficient and cost effective work.
The best software tool should be awarded to UiOslo iGEM because it's valuable for the future of science to integrate our everyday technology when we invent new technology. UiOslo iGEM does this by use of the camera of a mobile phone instead of separate photodiode in the design of our diagnostic test. This requires writing software to utilize the photodiode in the mobile phone appropriately. The software tool we have created analyzes the rgb value of pixels in a bitmap to measure wavelengths of the material that we take a picture of. This software could maybe be expanded to a spectrophotometer.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row subsite"><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><DIV id="hardware"><H2 class="boxheader left">Hardware</H2></DIV><P class="boxnotes leftext"> 	
PhoneLab is a unique module that connects your phone to your liquid samples, with adaptable case-options to make it accessible to many users world wide. It is especially formed due to our hypothetical defect CAS9 searching function, and the Nitrocefin Penta Well test. 
The Module has an on/off button and options to change the illumination of the liquid sample, allowing the camera for optimal color recognition. The five different liquid samples mounted in the PhoneLab module illuminates with a burnpoint at the camera. 
PhoneLab is designed for high quality 3D prints, and is recommended to be coated with a rubber surface for grip, then a hydrophobic functional surface to keep it clean.
We should win because all the data recorded with the PhoneLab module will be geo-tagged and stored, in a cloud open access. If this information accumulates, algorithms can be developed to predict the bacterial infection.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row subsite"><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><DIV id="entre"><H2 class="boxheader right">Entrepreneurship</H2></DIV><P class="boxnotes rightext"> 	
With PhoneLab, UiOslo iGEM 2016 present a product that could easily be commercialized. By creating our own unique hardware and software, we aim for enormous market of handheld devices. By utilizing the power in a smartphone and our design, PhoneLab could grow to be a mobile, easy-to-use and cheap detection tool usable in many different biological samples. Through the funds provided by our generous sponsors, we have been able to create a chassis of something that could aspire to greatness. We entered an innovation competition arranged by Inven2, the patent company of UiO, and got to the finale in a race for 250 000 NOK in start-up funds to create a company with PhoneLab as its product. We also plan to pitch our finalized project for them and file for a patent. This is just the beginning; through our innovative entrepreneurship, PhoneLab could change the face of modern diagnostics.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row subsite"><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><DIV id="measurement"><H2 class="boxheader left">WIKI</H2></DIV><P class="boxnotes leftext"> With this wiki, we have created a website for our project with a stylish design compiling all of our accomplishments in a systematic way.  As the wiki is the final, most comprehensie presentation of our project, it has been of importance to us to put as much information as possible on here. Designing the wiki in a tasteful way while still being easy to navigate and  meeting the requirements put forward by the iGEM competition is a comprehensive task. With only seven people in our team, getting everything up here has been a race against time, but it is our belief that we have created a wiki of the highest standard.
