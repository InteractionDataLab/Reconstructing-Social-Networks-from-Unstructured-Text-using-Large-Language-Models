Proof Of Concept
As a proof of concept, we have successfully demonstrated all the central aspects of our projects with functioning set-ups.
Lab:
- Our colorimetric assay with nitrocefin is tested and validated, and our detection limits are within a clinically relevant range
- Using BBa_K1189031, a beta lactamase encoding biobrick designed by the Calgary team of 2013, we successfully showed that by using different combinations of inhibitors, we can pin-point the enzymatic class of the beta lactamase present in the samples.
- By purifying the BBa_K1189031 protein, testing it with nitrocefin and inhibitors and creating and validating our own biobricks for class A, B and C beta lactamases, we have demonstrated safe positive controls to test for these three classes of ESBLs.
Hardware:
Our 3D-printed case successfully interfaces urine samples to the phone, illuminates the sample,places and holds the samples on a optimal distance for camera focus.
Software:
We have successfully created an app with an user interface that accesses the camera, reads and analyze the color change induced by the cleavage of nitrocefin from a picture taken in our software. The app also includes an information page where users can read about guidelines regarding UTIs.
Thus, we present a functioning chassis for a mobile diagnostic platform that easily, and within minutes can identify the presence of ESBL producing bacteria in urine samples, without ever having to expose any bacteria to antibiotics.
