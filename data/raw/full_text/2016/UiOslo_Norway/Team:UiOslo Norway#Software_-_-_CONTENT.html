Technology is changing rapidly. We believe, keeping up with these changes, will give valuable profit. Therefore our team have been seeking ways to transform processes by updating them with today's technology. We have created the elementary parts of an Android Application to show that one  process in the diagnostics field can be improved to enable more efficient and cost effective work.
The best software tool should be awarded to UiOslo iGEM because it's valuable for the future of science to integrate our everyday technology when we invent new technology. UiOslo iGEM does this by use of the camera of a mobile phone instead of separate photodiode in the design of our diagnostic test. This requires writing software to utilize the photodiode in the mobile phone appropriately. The software tool we have created analyzes the rgb value of pixels in a bitmap to measure wavelengths of the material that we take a picture of. This software could maybe be expanded to a spectrophotometer.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row subsite"><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV id="HER"><H2 class="boxheader middle">phoneLab</H2></DIV><P class="vboxnotes leftext"><B>APP DESCRIPTION</B></P><P class="boxnotes leftext">
The app developed for use with the PhoneLab was devised with the thought of measuring the color change of the urine samples by using the diode in our camera as the photoreceiver. Since the color change might be minute and only small amount of bacteria are antibiotic resistant we want to be able to register these small amounts of color change in the samples.</P><P class="boxnotes leftext">
At first we considered a full spectrophotometer but decided that just taking a picture under the right lighting circumstances would be adequate to measure color changes quite accurately. </P><P class="boxnotes leftext">
So the IT department designed the app based on these criteria and chose to develop the app with Android SDK using Java's API to handle the pixel readout and baseline comparisons that would have to be made to account for the different nuances of urine.
</P><P class="boxnotes leftext">
More precisely explained the app has to account for the base sample of urine and store the unique RGB value of the urine sample without any reagents, so that it can be compared to the samples with reagent. After this comparison is made the color change from the pixel’s RGB values are evaluated as either significant enough color change to determine antibiotic resistance or not significant enough color change to determine antibiotic resistance.</P><P class="boxnotes leftext">
The reason for using a camera diode instead of just looking with the naked eye is because of the sensitivity of the camera combined with controlled light environment should equate to more reliable measurements.</P><P class="boxnotes leftext"><B>APP DESIGN</B></P><P class="boxnotes leftext">
The app was created in Android SDK and AIDE (Android IDE) it features very simplistic design with some information about antibiotic resistance to help doctors choose suitable antibiotic alternatives in the case of a sample containing antibiotic resistant bacteria towards conventional antibiotics.</P><P class="boxnotes leftext">
The application takes a picture into the phoneLab device and runs a quick test on the resulting bitmap from the picture taken. </P><P class="boxnotes leftext">
The points of reference are the 7 dots on the example picture above, where the bottom sample has no reagent added to the urine so that the bottom sample is the color change reference point. The color change is then measured from this baseline RGB value and compared with the 6 other samples to evaluate if there has been a significant color change in any of them.</P><P class="boxnotes leftext"><B>APP FEATURES:</B> The app also features a information button that gives guidelines to health personnel. It includes information from the norwegian “legemiddelhandboka” an official document issued by the norwegian government.</P><P class="boxnotes leftext">This information can help health personnel to make decisions concerning various infections including urinary tract infections. </P><P class="boxnotes leftext"> App improvements and ideas for the future: From the beginning of developing we were considering a spectrophotometer to detect the color change instead of using the pixel value. We determined that the pixel value would be sufficient and proceeded with this approach since a spectrophotometer would be slightly more advanced and difficult to design. However after our cooperation with Waag society at the cutting edge festival (http://cuttingedgefestival.no/) we were presented a great design for a spectrophotometer that could be incorporated instead of pixel readout for a theoretically more precise diagnostic on color change.</P><P class="boxnotes leftext">The spectrophotometer that inspired what could possibly be the next generation of our diagnostics test: https://biohackacademy.github.io/biofactory/class/7/pdf/2%20Spectrometer%20design.pdf</P><P class="boxnotes leftext">The PhoneLab module could also be geo-tagged and stored in a cloud open access. If this information accumulates, algorithms can be developed to predict the bacterial infection.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row footer"><DIV class="col-md-4 footerelement"><H2 class="boxheader footerheader">Contact</H2><P class="boxnotes footercontact"> Blindernveien 31, 0371 Oslo</P><P class="boxnotes footercontact"> uioslonorway@gmail.com</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
