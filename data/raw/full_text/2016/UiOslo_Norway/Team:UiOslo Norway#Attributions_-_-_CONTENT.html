Even so, we did most of the work ourselves. Torleif, Marthe and Ragnhild spent hours after hours in the lab. And after a lot of frustration, sweat and even some tears they managed to finish the project on time right before the due date. We have two informatics students on the team, Roza and Paul. Roza designed her first webpage (our wiki) almost alone and she did a really good job. Camilla helped her a lot on the wiki and she edited the images for the wiki. Hans made a supercool 3D-printed model on his own and he even did the electrics by himself. Despite this, we did got some help and this page is dedicated to you. Thank you all for helping us, in one way or another. This project wouldn’t have happened without you!</P><P class="boxnotes leftext"><B>Project support and advice</B>
