Basic Parts
The UiOslo team has generated 4 basic parts and shipped them to the iGEM registry. All parts are different β-lactamase genes and have different connections to our diagnostic test project. More information and the usage of each part is documented in the iGEM registry. All parts was shipped for sequencing at GATC Biotech.
BBa_K1927000: This part is an ESBL gene class B called blaNDM-1 E.coli which represent class B carbapenemase of the ESBL group. It is without promoter, as it may be resistant to several types of antibiotics.
BBa_K1927001: This part is an ESBL gene class C. It is called blaCMY-6 class C plasmid – mediated AmpC and it is made without promoter for safety reasons, as it may be resistant to several types of antibiotics.
BBa_K1927002: This part is an antibiotic resistant gene called ampR. It conveys resistance to ampicillin.
BBa_K1927003: This part is an ampicillin resistant gene, the same as BBa_K1927002 but with and IPTG inducible promoter so its more convenient to express.
UiOslo Norway has also further characterized an already existing part in the iGEM registry. The contribution is documented on the parts main page as well as the experience page.The results are also displayed in the results section in this wiki.
BBa_K1189031: This part is a β-lactamase with a His – Tag couplet to a TALE – A enzyme.
