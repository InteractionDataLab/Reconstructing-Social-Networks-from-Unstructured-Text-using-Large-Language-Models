The 3D-model is made in the online 3D-modelling software at https://www.tinkercad.com. The 3D-model represent a E. coli bacterium and shows its DNA, plasmid, ribosomes, pili and flagellum.
The 3D-model was first meant to be a helpful tool during the lectures at “Ungforsk”. Unfortunately, the 3D-printer we had available had difficulties printing different parts of the model. Especially the parts sticking out of the core of the model, e.g. the pili and flagellum, where not compatible with our printer. This meaning that we could not print and use it during our project, but the 3D-model is available online, and we have given the file to the “Biologylab” at Department of Biosciences. Hopefully, they can use another printer and use it for educational purposes. The 3D-model represent a E. coli bacterium and shows different parts which can be helpful during lectures about e.g. protein synthesis and gene transfer.
