Every hour, 0.5mL was taken out and tested in the spectrophotometer, using the same method as above. The spectrophotometer was re-blanked each hour when a measurement was made, to ensure accurate readings. This was done for 6 hours. We stopped at 6 hours because at that point, the spectrophotometer was giving out readings of ~0.1 absorbance level.

6 Samples were obtained from Armstrong’s plant, to test the ability of the yeast to degrade starch in an industrial water sample. 
<P1>1. Aeration Basin
<P1>2. Secondary Clarifier
<P1>3. Primary Clarifier to Equalization Basin 
<P1>4. Primary Clarifier to Dry Broke
<P1>5. Primary Clarifier to Thickener 
<P1>6. Thickener

<P1>The six water samples were first tested to determine starch levels. The aeration basin, secondary clarifier, and primary clarifier to equalization basin samples did not contain a detectable level of starch. The primary clarifier to thickener and thickener samples contained a small amount of starch. The primary clarifier to dry broke contained a much higher percentage of starch. Thus, we ran our prototype testing with these three samples; primary clarifier to dry broke, primary clarifier to thickener, and thickener. To account for starch degradation from organisms already in the water, we ran a control without yeast cells. 25mL of sterile YPD broth was substituted for yeast culture in the control.</P1><P1>In order to simulate the physical conditions of the plant, we created a prototype. We simulated the DO levels by continuously aerating the samples. The mechanical agitation was simulated by adding a stirrer bar, which kept substrates in the sample evenly mixed throughout, as in the ceiling tile plant. </P1>
