We have made public engagement and education a cornerstone of our 2016 iGEM work. Through a variety of educational initiatives and public events, we have taught close to a 1000 students, talked to hundreds of adults, and are working in schools to promote learning and inquiry into synthetic biology and science research. This section documents our public engagement activities that are apart from our <A href="igem.org/Team:BroadRun-Baltimore/Buildingwbio">Building with Biology</A> outreach activities. </P1><H2>2015 Loudoun STEM Day</H2><P1>October 17, 2015</P1><P1>Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA) Loudoun Campus</P1><P1>Loudoun STEM Day is an all day event for families organized by the Northern Virginia Community College to showcase opportunities in science, technology, engineering and math. It is the largest STEM event in Loudoun County.</P1><P1>Building on the success of last year’s iGEM, we were able to secure a spot as an exhibitor at this event.  Our iGEM team held hands-on, fun learning activities at our booth. We exposed students to molecular biology with activities such as Twizzler DNA, DNA Trait Bracelets, and Plasmid DNA. These activities were modeled off the 2015 William and Mary iGEM team’s Synthetic Biology Teacher Curriculum. As we worked with the students during the hands-on activities, we used team-created colorful printed graphics to help parents and students better understand DNA and traits and to gain a sense of how that leads to engineering biological parts.</P1><P1>To teach people about the vast range in size of things in the world, from a cell to the DNA inside the cell to the molecules that make the DNA, we set up monitors with the <A href="http://http://htwins.net/scale/">“Size of the Universe”</A>, an interactive online program. At a third station, we used our iGEM poster and wiki to talk about our research and engage parents in a discussion about synthetic biology.</P1><P1>The event far exceeded our expectations; from 10 am until after 4 pm, we worked with large groups of kids and adults at our booth. With no break for lunch, because of a perpetual line of kids at our tables, we kept talking to parents and students and working through the day. Because of the unexpected high volume of attendees, we ran out of materials more than once, having to make three rushed trips to nearby stores to replenish supplies!</P1><P1>The feedback we received from this event was immense. Numerous parents, many of whom were leaders of robotics teams, elementary school teachers, a couple of school counselors, and many professionals with biology, science and other tech backgrounds, told us that their kids enjoyed learning from the activities, how much they appreciated us working one on one with their kids, as we shared passionately and patiently our love for science, and how they valued the efforts we took to explain the science clearly and knowledgeably. We received high commendation from Laura Siko, the event’s main organizer for handling a continuously large crowd throughout the day and for our positive contribution. Given our success, Ms. Siko eagerly invited us to exhibit at the next Loudoun STEM Day, which we recently did, in October 2016.</P1><P1><I>“It was so great having the Broad Run team at STEM Day. Their activities were engaging and popular! I will be sure to include you on the invitation when we host another STEM Day next year!”</I></P1><P1>
Seeing how we reached out to younger students, an elementary teacher who visited our booth, Mrs. Karla Paulson, invited us to run the same activities at her school’s upcoming STEM Night, STEM-mania.</P1><P1>Through Loudoun STEM Day, the largest science expo in our region, we engaged and worked with over 400 students introducing them to the basics of genetics and biology and engaged in conversations about synthetic biology with over a hundred adults.</P1><H2>STEM-mania at Tolbert Elementary School</H2><P1>November 19, 2015 </P1><P1>Family Science Night, Tolbert Elementary School, Invited by teacher, Karla Paulson</P1><P1>We were invited by Tolbert Elementary school teacher, Mrs. Karla Paulson, after she saw our fun learning activities at Loudoun Stem Day. In a fun-filled night, our iGEM team taught students and families about DNA structure, inheritance and how a plasmid works. These activities were modeled off of William and Mary’s iGEM team’s synthetic biology curriculum.</P1><P1>Kids and adults alike enjoyed the activities; a set of twins made the exact same DNA trait bracelet and were exhilarated by the concept that their DNA was identical. Another little girl had an ‘aha’ moment when she realized that the order in which she put the different colored marshmallows to make a “twizzler DNA” encoded the information contained in every living thing. Even though the trait bracelet activity appeared childish, many parents and teachers were intrigued by the uniqueness of each person’s trait bracelet leading them further to inquire how our genomes work and transitioned to how genomes can be edited.   </P1><P1>According to Mrs. Paulson, “The Broad Run iGEM assisted well over 100 kindergarten through 5th grade students as they completed three DNA investigations. They worked very well with the students and provided a meaningful learning experience!.”</P1><H2>American Society for Microbiology</H2><P1>Synthetic Biology 101: An Evening of Casual Science Conversations</P1><P1>October 28, 2015, Washington DC</P1><P1>At the American Microbiology Society’s <A href="http://www.synbioproject.org/events/synthetic-biology-101-an-evening-of-casual-science-conversations/">Synthetic Biology 101: An Evening of Casual Science Conversations</A> organized by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, we met with microbiology experts and researchers in the DC Metro Area. Speaking to a largely technical audience, our team members presented our research and networked with leaders in the molecular biology industry. Through showcasing our poster and iGEM wiki, we engaged in stimulating conversations, from the significance of iGEM to us as high school students, to our shared vision with iGEM about the importance of engaging the public on the safety and ethics of synthetic biology. </P1><H2>Panel Discussion at DC Fab Lab</H2><P1>November 12, 2015</P1><P1><P1><P1>Our team was invited to speak at Woodrow Wilson International Center’s <A href="http://www.synbioproject.org/events/the-rise-of-diybio/">panel discussion on synthetic biology and DIY Bio </A> at the FabLab, DC’s premier makerspace. The only students on a panel of synthetic biology experts and leaders in the budding DIY bio community, we shared our unique perspective. Our team discussed our research, voiced our opinions on broader issues concerning synthetic biology, and emphasized the importance of teamwork and leadership in research. The Panel Discussion was moderated by Dr. Todd Kulken of the Woodrow Wilson International Center’s Synthetic Biology Project.</P1><P>Photo Credit: Phyllis Klein</P><I><P1>Panelists: From our iGEM Team, Adriel Sumathipala (in photo, holding microphone), Marissa Sumathipala, and Dr. Nina Arendtsz; Dr. Tom Burkett (BUGSS), Shawn Moshasha (Open Bio Labs) and Phyllis Klein (Fab Lab DC) .

The RMI gala is acclaimed as one of the best networking events in manufacturing. Throughout the event, we talked to leaders in manufacturing, engineers, and scientists, discussing the future of manufacturing, how we, as students, envisioned our role in that future, and how synthetic biology could one day be a significant aspect in the future of manufacturing.</P1><P1>We received positive feedback regarding the manufacturing aspect of our research; many on the business side of manufacturing affirmed the benefits of innovating biological solutions as alternatives to the current solutions. Furthermore, many commended us for pursuing a project designed to be implemented in manufacturing, and how having bright young minds will further the field of manufacturing.</P1><H2>Capitol Hill Maker Faire</H2><P1>June 21, 2016</P1><P1>Rayburn House Office Building</P1><P1>At the nation’s second <A href="https://www.imls. gov/news-events/events/capitol-hill-maker-faire-2016&lt;/">Maker Faire hosted by the Congressional Maker Caucus</A> and held at the Congressional Rayburn House building, we presented our research and met with other maker spaces and community biology labs, hard at work discovering, building, and growing the next generation of makers and citizen-scientists. Organized by Congress, the DC Maker Faire is a convention of makerspaces and community labs from around the country.
