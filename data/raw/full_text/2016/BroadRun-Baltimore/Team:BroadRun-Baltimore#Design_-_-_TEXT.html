This is a prize for the team that has developed a synbio product to solve a real world problem in the most elegant way. The students will have considered how well the product addresses the problem versus other potential solutions, how the product integrates or disrupts other products and processes, and how  its lifecycle can more broadly impact our lives and environments in positive and negative ways.
A nearly 20 billion dollar industry, the ceiling tile industry has increased initiatives to incorporate environmental responsibility into the manufacturing process through recycled and renewable raw material use, which has wreaked problems in the production process; fluctuations of starch levels in process and waste water leading to butyric acid production and bad odors in the tiles that affects product quality and loss of revenue.
The current solution is application of biocides that carry its own environmental risk of contaminating surrounding ecosystems, are expensive, and short term. Additional measures of aeration to prevent anaerobic plant conditions that give rise to the butyric acid, are accomplished through powerful blowers that increase the energy consumption footprint and associated production costs.
We have collaborated with Armstrong World Industries, a leading global ceiling tile manufacturer, who seeks an alternative innovative solution to the butyric acid problem. Our biological solution of engineered yeast will directly target the root of the butyric acid problem, starch, and remove its excess. In the process and waste water system, our engineered yeast cells will work in conjunction with natural microbes in the water, contrasting to harsh chemical biocide treatments, thus making it a sustainable, cost effective, and environmentally responsible solution. This enables ceiling tile manufacturers like Armstrong to continue environmentally sustainable manufacturing without losing market competitiveness. It is also environmentally conscientious, as manufacturers now no longer have to use biocides, and furthermore, they can increase the content of recycled materials in the production of ceiling tiles since the butyric acid problem has been addressed at its source. Our project has a multitude of applications that will benefit society whilst preserving the environment.
More broadly, our research shows the great promise of synthetic biology to transform manufacturing industries. Technologies, like those developed in this research, can cut operational costs, increase production levels, create jobs in the American manufacturing sector and boost environmental sustainability initiatives.
