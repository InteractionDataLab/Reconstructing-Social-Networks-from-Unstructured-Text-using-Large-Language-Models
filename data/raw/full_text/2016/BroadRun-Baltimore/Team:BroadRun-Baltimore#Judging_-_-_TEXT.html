Judging
Bronze
✔Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Done!
✔Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page
Done!
✔Attributions: Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project.
Done! See our page here.
✔Part/Contribution: Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry
Done! See our part entry here.
Silver
✔ Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This working part must be different from the part documented in bronze medal criterion #4.
Done! See the entry of our working part and its characterization here.
✔Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synthetic biology problem.
Done! See our Collaborations page here.
✔ iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
Done! See our Silver Human Practices page here.
Gold
✔ Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Done! See our Gold Human Practices page here.
✔ Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry. Please see the Registry Contribution help page for help on documenting a contribution to an existing part. This part must NOT come from your team's 2016 range of part numbers.
Done! We improved characterization and proved functionality of one of our parts from last year, BBa_K1871002. See our Description Page here and the updated entry of this previous part here.
✔Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept.
Done! In our testing with the yeast strains, we were able to prove that the yeast were working as expected: the cells can produce amylase and produce starch. See our Proof page here.
✔Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab.)
Done! We created a prototype mimicking conditions of a ceiling tile plant and proved the possibility for implementation of our solution. See our Demonstrate page here.
