We are indebted to your generosity for full coverage of our $4,500 registration fee to be a 2015 iGEM team, and the $500 given to cover our lab usage fee at the Baltimore Underground Science Space. Special thanks to Mr.Paul Hough for pushing our request for sponsorship through. Without your generous financial assistance, our iGEM research project would not have been possible. Thanks also to the ceiling tile plant engineers, Mr. Tom Woolley, Mr. Michael McCarty, and Mr. Craig Hoosier, for providing us with information about the plant parameters and taking us on a tour of the plant. </P1><H3>Stone Bridge High School</H3><P1>We would like to thank Stone Bridge High School for providing us with a lab, equipment, and materials to complete our yeast transformation and all of our testing work with the yeast. When we were stuck without a lab in mid August, Stone Bridge took us in on short notice and has fully supported our iGEM research since then, for which we are incredibly grateful. Special thanks go to Dr.Cascio for all the late hours and weekends she spent at the lab supervising our testing work, the time and effort she put into preparing materials for us, and helping us troubleshoot when things went wrong. </P1><H3>BUGSS</H3><P1>We would like to thank Baltimore Underground Science Space for providing us with lab space, equipment and materials from July up through August 4. Thank you to Dr. Burkett for accompanying us to Armstrong headquarters in November 2015, and to Dr. Sarah Laun for putting in extra hours supervising us when lab work went wrong and took longer than expected.  </P1><H3>IDT</H3><P1>Thank you to Integrated DNA Technologies for synthesizing our gene constructs and primers, providing us the necessary DNA to perform this whole project. </P1><H3>Sigma Aldrich </H3><P1>Thank you to Sigma Aldrich for providing us with potassium iodine at no cost. Special thanks to Brenda Taylor for her quick response and shipping the potassium iodide so quickly. </P1><H3>Bio Basic </H3><P1>Thank you to BioBasic for providing us with YPD broth at a steeply discounted cost. Special thanks to Joshua Lucate at BioBasic for shipping the YPD broth so quickly and for providing us with a generous discount. </P1></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
