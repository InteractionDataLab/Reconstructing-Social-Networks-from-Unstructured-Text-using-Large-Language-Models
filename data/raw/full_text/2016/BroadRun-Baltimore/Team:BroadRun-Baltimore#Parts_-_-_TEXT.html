Description of Basic Parts:
ADH1 Terminator - This part is the terminator region from yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1) gene. This stops the RNA polymerase from transcribing the DNA sequence.
Kozak Sequence - This part initiates translation from eukaryotic mRNA and is placed between a promoter and coding sequence to facilitate translation.
pCyc medium promoter - This is a medium expression level constitutive promoter. It directs the cell to transcribe the DNA sequence constantly.
Mating Factor Alpha Secretion Sequence - This part is the secretion signal from yeast α-mating factor, and directs the secretion of the produced protein. This allows the exportation of the protein.
Penicillium Alpha Amylase - Obtained from the fungus Penicillium, α-Amylase is an enzyme that hydrolyses alpha bonds of large, alpha-linked polysaccharides, such as starch and glycogen, thus degrading the polysaccharides into monosaccharides and disaccharides.
S.ferax Alpha Amylase - Obtained from the fungus Saprolegnia ferax, α-Amylase is an enzyme that hydrolyses alpha bonds of large, alpha-linked polysaccharides, such as starch and glycogen, thus degrading the polysaccharides into monosaccharides and disaccharides.
B.cereus Beta Amylase - Obtained from the fungus Saprolegnia ferax, α-Amylase is an enzyme that hydrolyses beta bonds of large, beta-linked polysaccharides, such as cellulose and some starches, thus degrading the polysaccharides into monosaccharides and disaccharides.
In addition to the 3 new parts submitted this year, we also improved a previous part, from last year. To see how we improved the characterization of this part, please see here .
