Equipment was inventoried with refrigerator space shared with graduate student lab in facilities. </P><P>8/19-8/25: The interlab data was submitted. Assembly PCR with new primers was performed. This were somewhat effective, but produced a smear, leading us to conclude that the DNA was degraded. At this point, the primary project was abandoned, as there was not sufficient time to order new DNA and PCR the toehold. </P><P>8/26-9/1: Break prior to the start of the semester </P><P>9/2-9/8: Break during start of the semester - Tufts University classes begin</P><P>9/9-9/15: iGEM website </P><P>9/16-9/22: iGEM outreach with Student Campus Activity Fair.
