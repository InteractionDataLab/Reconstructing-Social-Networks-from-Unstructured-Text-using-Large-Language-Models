InterLab
Standard Tracks: The procedure was followed exactly as according to the Interlab procedure provided by iGEM.
There were not a great many challenges faced in following the InterLab procedure, although the results acquired, which have been submitted to iGEM, were occasionally unusual. It is possible that a serial dilution was performed incorrectly, resulting in strange absorbance results, which then affected the rest of the project. Obstacles faced included acquiring all of the necessary materials. To do this, we collaborated with the Nair lab, who allowed us to use their autoclave in order to make plates and provided plates for absorbance ad fluorescence imaging.
