Welcome to iGEM 2018!
The Tufts Synthetic Biology Club has been working on iGem projects for the past four years. Welcome to our 2018 wiki!
What was our project?
We used toehold switches that collapsed upon the binding of miRNAs, causing Cas13a to be transcribed, which would theoretically allow for a signal to be detected with the use of fluorescent probes.
Why is this important?
Whenever a disease process occurs in the human body, specialized miRNAs are released. Using these to cause the collapse of our toehold could allow for early detection of disease from blood samples.
Who are we?
Background research was performed by Tufts Students throughout the 2017-18 school year. Some of these Tufts undergraduates worked with a couple of students from the nearby area to put this project to work over the 2018 summer months.
