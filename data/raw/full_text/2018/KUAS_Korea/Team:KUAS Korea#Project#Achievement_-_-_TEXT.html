Silver
Convince the judges that at least one new BioBrick Part (Basic or Composite, must be RFC10 compatible) of your own design that is related to your project works as expected. Clearly document the experimental characterization on that Part's Main Page on the Registry. You must submit a sample of this new part to the Registry (following the Registry submission requirements). This part must be different from the new part documented for Gold #2 : BBa_K2564000
Convince the judges you have significantly worked with one (or more) currently registered 2018 iGEM team(s) in a meaningful way. For example, mentor a team (or be mentored by a team), characterize a part, troubleshoot a project, host a meetup, model/simulate a system, or validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem. : Link
Convince the judges you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your work is responsible and good for the world. Document on your team wiki how you have investigated these issues and engaged with your relevant communities, why you chose this approach, and what you have learned. Please note that surveys will not fulfill this criteria unless you follow scientifically valid methods. : Link
Gold
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the purpose, design, and/or execution of your project. Document on your team wiki how your project has changed based upon your human practices work. : Link
Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling. This could be either a new model you develop or the implementation of a model from a previous team. You must thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on your team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, model results, and a clear explanation of your model that anyone can understand. : Link
