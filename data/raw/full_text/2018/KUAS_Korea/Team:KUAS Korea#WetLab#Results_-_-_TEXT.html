1. Beta-glucosidase expression
Cooperator expresses beta-glucosidase with constitutive promoter to degrade cellobiose around it. We had the cell stock of cooperator with pCEL vector containing beta-glucosidase and transformed it into E.coli BW25113. The medium plate contains cellobiose instead of glucose to check whether E.coli that we transformed expresses beta-glucosidase on its surface. The streaking side below shows that cooperator grows on cellobiose containing M9 minimal medium.

2. GFP expression
Cheater expresses GFP when it obtains glucose. We had the cell stock of cheater with the vector encoding GFP as a reporter gene and transformed it firstly into E.coli DH5α and then to E.coli BW25113.
