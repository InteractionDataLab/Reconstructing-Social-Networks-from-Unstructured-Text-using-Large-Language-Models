KUAS Korea
We are team KUAS_Korea, Korea University Association of Synthetic Biology.  Our team has been annually participating in iGEM since 2009. This year we proudly present its team of 9 undergraduate students that are all from different backgrounds, but all with passion and interest. In our hard work with two enthusiastic supporters; one instructor and one professor, we successfully take part in iGEM 2018.
