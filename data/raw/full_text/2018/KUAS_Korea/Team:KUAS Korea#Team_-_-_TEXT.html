Team
KUAS Korea
We are team KUAS_Korea, Korea University Association of Synthetic Biology.  Our team has been annually participating in iGEM since 2009. This year we proudly present its team of 9 undergraduate students that are all from different backgrounds, but all with passion and interest. In our hard work with two enthusiastic supporters; one instructor and one professor, we successfully take part in iGEM 2018.
Members
Bosun Ryu
Wet Lab Leader
Bosun Ryu is a junior majoring in environmental science and ecological engineering. It is his first year to attend iGEM, so he is excited to be part of the team. Arsenal is his favorite football club, but this does not mean that KUAS iGEM team is going to win the fourth place. (We always go for the trophies.) He wants to remind you that his favorite number is not "4".
Uijin Han
Dry Lab Leader
Uijin is this year's Dry-lab leader of KUAS_Korea! She is committed to the development of computer simulation of the project. Her primary interest lies in the communication of science and society and the role of scientists as major actors of the international society. She hopes that their work can make a small step ahead towards a better world!
