Producer strain (“cooperator”): display of β-glucosidase on the cell surface
Cheater strain: expression of GFPuv in the cell, which acts as a reporter gene
The mechanism is as follows.
The producer (cooperator) constitutively expresses beta-glucosidase on its surface and degrades the cellobiose.
The cooperator and the cheater take them as energy source and the cheater expresses GFPuv as a reporter gene when it takes up the glucose.
As the ratio between the cheater and cooperator changes, the total number of cooperator and cheater changes at the end.
