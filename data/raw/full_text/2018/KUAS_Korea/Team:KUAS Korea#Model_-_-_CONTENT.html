The key point of this model is that the two strains <SPAN style="background-color: #FFFFCC">compete for a single type of energy source- the glucose</SPAN>(which is marked as ‚Äòpublic good‚Äô in the figure). However, the glucose is scarce in the environment; it is actually not provided in the media but can only be generated by the hydrolytic activity of Œ≤-glucosidase on cellobiose. This is the point where the cooperator shows it‚Äôs altruism.

               <OL>Several assumptions were made prior to the modeling.</OL><OL><LI><SPAN style="background-color: #FFFFCC">The higher total cell density will increase the relative growth rate of the cooperator.</SPAN></LI>
               - If the total cell density is high, it is more likely that there are more cooperators which leads to the bigger production of glucose. Less scarcity of the glucose loosens the competition of cooperator and cheater, which means the effect of cost on survival becomes smaller while the effect of the benefit becomes bigger.<LI><SPAN style="background-color: #FFFFCC">The growth rate of the cooperator will increase as its initial relative population increase.</SPAN></LI>
               - The initial population condition will be one of the key variables of this model. If the cooperator to cheater ratio is high, cooperator will gain enough benefit from their cellobiose-cleavage activity. In this case, the metabolic cost of Œ≤-glucosidase expression is endurable since the cooperator itself needs the Œ≤-glucosidase activity anyway in order to obtain glucose as the energy source. However, when the cooperator to cheater ration is low, cooperator will not get enough benefit compared to the investment(cost) it has made. This will lower the survival rate of the cooperator while making cheater easy to survive.</OL>

In our case, limiting nutrient will be cellobiose. Also, in our experiment we have to find out the quantificated information of the dependence of the growth rate on substance. Finally, we can compare the growth rates of two E.coli strains.<CENTER>[Fig 1] Monod Equation</CENTER>


This is basic monod Equation. S is glucose released from cellobiose by cooperators. S can be derived from multiplication of q, œÅ, œá. q refers the glucose released from cellobiose by cooperators, œÅ is the number of total cell density, and œá is the frequency of the cooperator.<CENTER>[Fig 2] Cooperator Equation</CENTER><CENTER>[Fig 3] Cheater Equation</CENTER>



Then, we modified monod equation for Cooperator and Cheater. _ùúá_0_ is specific growth rate without glucose and c is the cost of the cooperation. Cost of the cooperation will decrease the growth rate of the cooperator. And ùõø is an advantage of cooperation. The cheater will not get the benefit of the cooperation. So we should minus from the cheater‚Äôs growth rate. And, we think that disadvantage comes from the glucose capture efficiency. Cheater could not catch efficiently like cooperator. So we give disadvantage to cheater by multiplying (1 ‚Äì ùúÄ) .

<CENTER>[Fig 4] relative fitness</CENTER>

And we divided _ùúá_ùëê_ by _ùúá_ùê∑_ to express the relative fitness of cooperator.

<CENTER>[Fig 5] glucose capture efficiency</CENTER>



And we esitmated the efficency of glucose capture with dividing glucose flux by glucose creation rate. We assumed that the glucose molecules produced by Œ≤-glucosidase directly diffuse into media because it is located in the outer membrane of E.coli. And this will cause temporary increase of glucose concentration by a local cloud of glucose at the surface. And this will benefit to influx rate of the glucose into the cell.

As a result, cheater growth is higher than value c. Also if glucose efficiency increase cheater need more cooperator to reach the maximum growth
 
 
<H4><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></H4>
 
By dry-lab modeling, we can modify the specific conditions of the model by changing the values of the parameters. In the case above, we changed the epsilon value. In the well mixed medium, cheater is the dominant species in the co-culture environment. But when the epsilon value increases, cheater needs more altruistic activities of cooperators. However in the end, cheater and cooperator  certain concentration in co-culture. We assumed that it is because only the cooperator can make glucose, which is the only energy source for both cheater and cooperator.
