Brief Summary of Results
Following transient expression of pJAB1489 and pJAB1504, there appeared to be little to no expression of GFP compared to the background level of expression. There also appeared to be no expression of the BS3 construct either. As neither construct showed expression, future experiments should be focused on validating the system in Nicotiana benthamiana, optimizing the gene transfer method.
Future Directions
Following validation, the system may be adapted to create an inducible toxin recognition system. As described by Tsinghua 2017, the single chain variable fragments can be attached to the activating and binding domains of Gal4 to enhance expression of genes downstream of a UAS/promoter. It is our hope that future iGEM teams will be able to harness this type of system to create a variety of toxin recognition systems to remove contaminated food before it hits the shelves.
The 6X UAS promoter is part  BBa_K2575001
The BS3 part number is: BBa_K2575000
