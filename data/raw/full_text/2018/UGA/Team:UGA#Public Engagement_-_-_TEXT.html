Lambert Summer Camp Co-Teaching
We also went to teach at a summer camp for middle school students about synthetic biology concepts, ranging from basic biotech procedures to biology lessons regarding the central dogma. We also shared experiences and advice with the students, both from Lambert and those attending the camp, about our experiences with college life/research.
