Collaborations
We helped Lambert high school with several activities throughout the semester. First, we helped them with the completion of their interlab. High schools do not have access to plate reader technology, so inviting them to UGA and conducting their interlab with them allowed them to partake in this activity.
We also went to teach at a summer camp for middle school students about synthetic biology concepts, ranging from basic biotech procedures to biology lessons regarding the central dogma. We also shared experiences and advice with the students, both from Lambert and those attending the camp, about our experiences with college life/research.
Finally, we helped test their in-house made electroporator, testing their product and recording plate reader data for the GFP construct they transformed.
