Our iGEM team is from Anhui University of Technology, Ma 'anshan, China. The name of our project this year is Carbon dioxide purifier. The brief introduction of the project is as follows:
With greenhouse effect becoming a widespread concern in recent years, how to effectively capture CO2 has become a worldwide problem. At present, CO2 capture mostly includes absorption, adsorption and membrane methods, etc., which have problems with high cost, high energy consumption for regeneration and secondary pollution. CO2 capture using carbonic anhydrase has attracted extensive attention due to its high catalytic efficiency and environmentally friendly properties. First, our project successfully expressed wide type carbonic anhydrase 2 in E. coli, however, its industrial application was limited due to poor stability and easy inactivation. Therefore, based on this, molecular simulation technology was used to investigate effect of amino acid residues mutation on the conformation and activity of enzyme, and the mutant carbonic anhydrase with higher thermal stability was obtained. The experimental results showed that the purified mutant carbonic anhydrase exhibited higher stability and activity than wild type carbonic anhydrase, achieving efficient capture of CO2.
Overview
We were divided into groups of students in different majors, including those responsible for experiment, art design, web programming, social practice and cooperation, and mathematical modeling.  At the same time, as we are from a country where the mother tongue is not English, we have arranged some students to be responsible for English translation and English presentation.
Experiment group
The students in charge of the experiment are Pan Luyao, Liu Zhihao, Bian Weixin, Wang Xiangxuan, Hu Zhiyuan, Qin Zichen, Wang Huichao,Chen Yuru,Chen Jinrui.  They completed the experimental portion of the project, building Biobricks that met the standards of iGEM.
Art design group
The students responsible for art design are Sun Yu, Wang Yalong and Jiang Yu. They completed the design of poster, team flag, team banner, and team uniform, and they participated in the figure production of wiki.
Wiki group
The students responsible for web programming students are Cao Jinhui, Zhu Dazhu, Tao Wei. They did all the wiki job.
Modeling group
The students responsible for mathematical modeling are Wang Qiong, Zhao Lei and Ma Xiaoguang. They completed the mathematical modeling work related to the project, and Zhao Lei developed the gas detection device used in the cooperation activity with an aerial model team of our university.
English group
The students responsible for English translation and presentation are Xia Yongli, Ge Yan, Chen Chen, Zhou Wan, Zhao Boya.They have completed all the documents on the wiki that need to be translated into English, and Xia Yongli, Ge Yan, Chen Chen, Zhou Wan and Wang Huichao will have live presentations during the competition.
Human practice group
The students responsible for social practice and cooperation are Fan Zixuan, Zhou Yu, Lou Feiyue.All activities of HP and collaboration are organized and conducted by them. They are also responsible for communication with iGEM teams of other colleges.
Acknowledgement
Our team consists of 8 instructors, including Xu Xiangrong,Xu Hao,Ma Liang,Liu Zi,Ruilan Cao,She Huili,Xu Xia,Xu Jian. Our PI is Xu Xiangrong and Secondary PI is Xu Hao.  We are so grateful to the instructors and advisors for their advice on our work. They provided us with laboratories and professional guidance. Prof. Xu Xiangrong provided some information of Human practice.  Prof.Xu Xia,Prof.Xu Jian,Dr.Ma Liang and Dr.Liu Zi are responsible for the guidance of the wet lab.  Our experiment mainly carried out in Dr.Ma Liang's laboratory. At the same time, we carried out experiments with the help of some instruments in Biochemical Engineering Research Center, BERC-AHUT by Prof.Xu Xia and Prof.Xu Jian. Prof.Cao Ruilan gave us some suggestions on English translation and English presentation  Dr.She Huili gave us some advice on art design.  Dr. Xu Hao guides us the programming, mathematical modeling and Dry lab.
Meanwhile, we invited Leng Huji, Ding Yuqing, Zou Shoushuo and Long Lijuan as advisors. They provided us some suggestions for our project.
