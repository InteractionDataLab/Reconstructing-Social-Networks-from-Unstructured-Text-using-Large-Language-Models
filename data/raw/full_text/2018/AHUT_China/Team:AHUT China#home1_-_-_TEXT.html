Ahut_China 2018 Project Description
Due to the serious impact on the world environment caused by the increasing greenhouse gases, it is crucial for us to deal with the greenhouse gases effectively. Given to the fact that the traditional collection technique of carbon dioxide is still at its early stage and characterized by its high consumption and low efficiency, thus, this technique hasn’t been fully developed yet. In our project, through the mutation of carbonic anhydrase gene, the protein molecules expressed by it were simulated by computer to obtain carbonic anhydrase (CA-2) with high thermal stability, and we can realize the efficient collection of carbon dioxide after CA-2 has been transformed into the E. coil.
