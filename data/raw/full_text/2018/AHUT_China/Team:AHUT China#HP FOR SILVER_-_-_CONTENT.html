After seeing the cooperation application issued by the iGEM team of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT-Madras) at the iGEM official website, we contacted IIT-Madras to discuss cooperation actively.
We are pleased to collaborate with the iGEM team of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT-Madras) to make a video on the science of synthetic biology in the mother tongue. The Indian Institute of Technology is also working with other teams in English, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Bengali, Gujarati and Hindi.
IIT-Madras sends an English script to our team. We need to match the provided slideshow video with the provided text and add the translated text to the subtitles, and finally make it into Chinese video.
We thought it was a simple matter, but there were some problems at the beginning. The problems are summarized as follows:
1. The English script does not exactly match the sound in the video, and some paragraphs are missing.
2. English and Chinese belong to different language families. They are slightly different in grammar, and the word order is reversed in translation.
3. Some video pictures and sounds are out of sync and need to be adjusted.4. Our team members are not familiar enough with the Indian accent in English, and some words cannot be completely accurate.
After consultation and repeated revisions by the iGEM team members of the Anhui University of Technology, four days later, the results were satisfactory and the video was sent to the iGEM team of the Indian Institute of Technology. We have established a good relationship with the iGEM team (IIT-Madras) of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.
With the successful completion of the HP cooperation, the Anhui University of Technology iGEM team (AHUT-CHINA) looks forward to more cooperation opportunities with the Indian Institute of Technology iGEM team (IIT-Madras). </P></NBSP></NBSP></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="section_title "><DIV align="center"><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆'; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; font-size: 36px; text-align: center;"><STRONG style="font-family: Segoe, 'Segoe UI', 'DejaVu Sans', 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;color: #000000;">2.Visit Hua Qi environmental protection company</STRONG></P><NBSP><NBSP><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆'; font-size: 18px;"><SPAN style="font-size: 24px">On</SPAN> the afternoon of September 12, 2018, our team AHUT_China visited Ma'anshan Hua Qi Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd.

Our project is to deal with greenhouse gas CO2 in air pollution. How to deal with greenhouse gas CO2 efficiently is particularly critical as the increasing greenhouse effect has a serious impact on the global environment. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the current environmental pollution in China, we visited HuaQi Environmental Protection Company HuaQi Environmental Protection Company, is a company specializing in sewage treatment.

During the visit, we learned that water pollution is currently harmful to the environment and people's health. So, water pollution treatment is very important. We introduced our project to computerize the protein molecules expressed by carbonic anhydrase gene mutations to obtain carbonic anhydrase (CA-2) with high thermal stability and import it into E. coli cells in order to achieve efficient collection of CO2. The project is currently in the theoretical stage. She is interested in our project. If the CO2 emission can be effectively controlled at the source, the problems such as the continued destruction of ozone layer, the melting of two-stage glaciers and the rapid extinction of a large number of species can be effectively solved. And she is more concerned about how this project can be applied in practice, and puts forward some suggestions for our project. At present, the CO2 gas capture technology mainly includes chemical absorption, pressure swing adsorption and membrane separation. She suggested that firstly transgenic E. coli be cultured in solution environment with chemical absorption to achieve CO2 collection, and that secondly CO2 be treated with biological rotating disc. </P><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆';  font-size: 14px;text-align: center;">Fig.2 Group photo at HuaQi Environmental Protection Company (second from right: Liu Shanshan)</P></NBSP></NBSP></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="section_title "><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆'; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; font-size: 38px; text-align: center;"><STRONG style="font-family: Segoe, 'Segoe UI', 'DejaVu Sans', 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;color: #000000;"> 3 . iGEM(Linkoping_Sweden)</STRONG></P><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆'; font-size: 18px;"><SPAN style="font-size: 26px">We</SPAN> saw the cooperation request issued by Linking University's iGEM team (Linkoping_Sweden).

During this time, we briefly introduced our project background and project ideas and planned the agenda of the meeting. As the greenhouse effect has become a common concern in recent years, how to effectively capture carbon dioxide has become a worldwide problem. At present, carbon dioxide capture mainly includes absorption, adsorption and membrane method,which are renewable energy consumption of high cost and have twice as many pollution problems. The use of CO2 to capture the high catalytic efficiency and environmental friendliness of the carbon anhydride has aroused wide concern.</P><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆';  font-size: 14px;text-align: center;">Fig.8 Meeting with three other universities</P><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆'; font-size: 18px;">So our Anhui University of Technology team put forward a project on the generation of carbon anhydride through E. coli to absorb carbon dioxide. First of all, our project successfully expressed the Wide-type carbonic anhydride enzyme in Escherichia coli, however, due to its poor stability and ease of deactivation, its industrial applications were limited. Therefore, based on the molecular simulation technique, the effect of mutation of amino acid residues on the conformation and activity of enzymes was studied, and the mutant carbonic anhydride with high thermal stability was obtained. The experimental results show that the purified mutant carbonic anhydride has higher stability and activity than the wild type of carbonic anhydride enzyme, which realizes the effective capture of CO2. Northeastern university, Shandong university, and the members of Northwestern University have expressed their strong interest in the project of Anhui University of technology, so we have the highlights of our project and other members of the school exchange. Highlights: 1, Instead of the high cost, high efficiency and poor circulation of traditional methods, we choose a safe and environmentally friendly method with low cost and high catalytic efficiency for trapping CO2 with carbon anhydride. 2,By using the molecular simulation technique, the amino acid as the basic unit, the effect of remnant radical mutation on the two-stage structure of the carbonic anhydride enzyme, and the influence of the molecular conformation, the best amino acid mutation site was obtained, and the thermal stability of the enzyme was improved without affecting the enzyme activity. 3, We obtained the expression of wild type and mutant carbonic anhydride enzyme strains of Escherichia coli, and two kinds of carbon anhydride enzyme in vitro purification, wild-type carbonic anhydride enzyme has a certain CO2 capture efficiency, more importantly, the mutant than the wild type of carbonic anhydride enzyme has better stability and activity, realize the CO2 efficient capture.</P><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆';  font-size: 14px;text-align: center;">Fig.9 Meeting with three other universities</P><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆'; font-size: 18px;">Students from Tohoku University also briefed members of our other schools about their projects, and the Tohoku University project was inspired by the prevalence of fast food and the acceleration of urbanization, with the number of inflammatory bowel diseases (inflammatory bowel disease, IBD) rising in Asia, And the risk of developing colorectal cancer (colorectal cancer, CRC) in patients with IBD also increased. There are no drugs that are better for ibd, so they want to use engineered probiotics to treat IBD and prevent crc,by using synthetic biology. The rest of us were very interested in the project, and our Anhui University of Technology team actively asked them for details about their project, and they briefed them on the background and main contents of their project. The background of their project is that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is caused by inappropriate immune responses, which in general trigger a series of events that can disrupt the barrier when the immune system reacts excessively to the bacteria in the gut, eventually causing IBD when the immune imbalance persists without intervention. There is no cure for IBD at present,and the best treatment now is to use anti-inflammatory drugs such as TNF inhibitor treatment, but the patient's drug treatment effect is of huge difference.And 
it is ineffective to more than 50% of the patients . Probiotics are beneficial to the host of active microorganisms, colonization in the human intestinal tract, reproductive system, oral cavity and so they can produce the exact health effects of the microbial group.They have been beneficial to bacteria such as boulardii yeast used in clinical diarrhea treatment. The Tohoku University team aims to design a biological system for ANTI-IBD and CRC prevention through the use of engineered Probiotics. Because the concentration of NO in the intestinal tract of IBD is about 100 times than that of normal people, NO molecule acts as their inflammatory signaling molecule, and probiotic Escherichia coli (nissle 1917) is selected as their chassis organism. The project consists of two sets of devices, one of which is an anti-inflammatory device, which includes a sensor for detecting inflammatory signals, a high-efficiency enhancer, and an effector that secretes interleukin (IL-10); the second is an anti-cancer device, which is expressed through engineered probiotics, which is derived from a cross-flowered vegetable ( Cruciferous vegetables (myrosinase), which converts the natural component of Thio-glucoside (sinigrin) from a cross-flowered vegetable into a turnip (sulforaphane).The product of radish is a kind of organic molecule with anticancer activity, and it can inhibit oxidative stress (oxidative stress), so it can also inhibit the intestinal inflammatory reaction. In addition, they use cold-shock kill switches (cold-excited expression lysis and Maz-ef) to prevent their engineered bacteria from escaping into the environment and causing DNA contamination.</P><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆'; font-size: 18px;">Members of the Northwestern University team introduced their project background that saline soils may affect the growth of crops such as wheat and rice. Because traditional saline soils are difficult and inefficient, they have decided to address this global challenge in new ways. Several parts of the bacterium are designed to reduce the concentration within the range. Their project is to modify potassium channels by using non-natural amino acid d-alanine,and they obtained a new channel protein, which allows K + to be considered in a high concentration of K + and allows Na + to be considered in a low concentration of K +. Because of the use of d-ala, a part of the introduction of unnatural amino acids into bacteria was established. They analyzed proteins and tested them by molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry, and established mathematical models of the relationship between cells and salt concentrates. They will use patch clamps and a new method to test proteins and bacteria in the solution. After their cell experiments, they will use it for agricultural and water purification processes.</P><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆'; font-size: 18px;">The project of Shandong University is about PHB an environmental bio-plastic Project. At the same time, we will carefully analyze the problems in the experiments and the modeling that are currently encountered in our project, so that we can better understand our project and excavate the parts that we may need to cooperate. In the course of the discussion, we talked about our understanding of synthetic biology, including its great potential for human benefit and the recent astonishing breakthroughs scientists have made. Then we showed and explained our project in depth, and they gave us some good suggestions, such as the improvements in cell secretion pathways that are practical, valuable and meaningful. We are really looking forward to our late-stage cooperation and exchanges with the United States to participate in the event of grand camping meetings.</P><DIV align="center">  </DIV><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆';  font-size: 14px;text-align: center;">Fig.10 Meeting venue</P></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="section_title "><DIV align="center"><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆'; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; font-size: 38px; text-align: center;">    <STRONG style="font-family: Segoe, 'Segoe UI', 'DejaVu Sans', 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;color: #000000;">6. Callobration with NEU-China</STRONG></P><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆'; font-size: 18px;"><SPAN style="font-size: 26px">On</SPAN> August, 2018, our team established a connection with iGEM group of NEU-China-A and thus a couple of video conferences have been made so far. The two teams introduced each other's projects in detail; the project of NEU-China was to design a biological system against IBD and preventing CRC by using engineered probiotics. Since the concentration of NO in the intestines of IBD patients was about 100 times higher than that of normal people; therefore, NO molecules were chosen as inflammatory signals, and probiotics (Nissle 1917) were selected as chassis organisms. The project consisted of two sets of devices, one of which was an anti-inflammatory equipment, including a sensor for detecting inflammatory signals, an effective enhancer and an effector secreting interleukin 10 (il-10). Another one was an anti-cancer device,which is able to express a kind of myrosinase from cruciferous vegetables by virtue of engineering probiotics. Meanwhile, it can transfer glucosinolate, a natural ingredient in cruciferous vegetables into sulforaphane. Such a kind of product was a type of organic molecule with cancer-fighting ability and at the same time it could inhibit oxidative stress. Similarly, it could work against intestinal inflammation. In addition, we used cold shock kill switches (cold shock expression Lysis and maz-ef) to prevent our engineer bacteria from escaping into the environment and causing DNA contamination. </P><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆'; font-size: 18px;">
During exchange of project experience with each other, we learned that NEU-China-A had a little bit of a problem in one of the plasmid insertion experiments, so they asked us for help and wanted us to conduct the construction experiment of secreting the yebf-homoil10 plasmid.Our counterpart and we made it clear about what we were going to cooperate followed by three video meetings. NEU-China-A helped us carry out experiments on optimizing the conditions of prokaryotic expression of CSCA protein and purifying expression. In a similar way, we helped NEU-China-A perform fragment-linking experiment. NEU-China-A provided us with original plasmid of PCDF-Duet1 (dry powder tube), they taught us to overlap the secretion label Yebf (from BL21(DE3)DNA, GenBank: EF648003.1) with human-derived interleukin 10 (from BBa_K554004, Spring 2018 Distribution 21K 2018 Kit Plate 1), and required us to add the FLAG label at the N end of homoIL10 for subsequent protein detection. According to the requirements of our friend, we conducted the experiment on construction of secreting the plasmid Yebf-homoIL10. Having sequenced and verified the plasmid construction successfully, we mailed the no less than 100ng plasmid dry powder to them.

At the same time, we have learned that the biomembrance process can not only treat sewage, but also can be applied to the treatment of organic gases. The pollutants in the organic waste gas are first contacted with water and dissolved in water, that is, diffused from the gas film into the liquid film; The organic pollutant components in the liquid film are diffused to the biofilm by the difference in concentration, and they are captured and absorbed by the microorganisms therein; the organic pollutants entering the microorganisms are decomposed as energy and nutrients in the metabolism of the microorganisms themselves. This provides us with some ideas on the combination of theory and practice.</P><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆'; font-size: 18px;">Through a visit to the Biofilm Process Water Purification Laboratory in the afternoon, we learned about the biofilm treatment of sewage.

NEFU modeling: They store information in a yeast, and the time of information storage is the key to the case. The information storage time (a yeast growth time) needs to consider some parameters ,such as the initial inputs of α yeast and a yeast, the concentration of a-factor, and the expression efficiency of Bax gene. Firstly, partial correlation analysis is used to analyze the local sensitivity of the complex relationship between parameters and results, which provides a basis for accurate and efficient modeling and reliability analysis of simulation results. The results of sensitivity analysis showed that the secretion amount of α-factor and the growth time of a yeast had a higher sensitivity . Therefore, α- factor is refined into dry powder, which excludes the influence on the information storage of other interference factors such as the growth of α yeast . Secondly, since the main body of case is that the two kinds of yeast cultured in the medium ,and the growth of α yeast has some effects on the growth of a yeast should also be taken into account. So the competition model and the gun battle model are established. Finally, they provided a web-based, fully interactive modeling platform that provided information for wet experiments. <SPAN style="font-size: 20px">Model 1:</SPAN>
According to the case process we guess that : the amount of information stored (a growth time of yeast) is related to the initial inputs of two yeasts, The amount of α-factorsecreteby α yeast, and the promoting efficiency of the promoter. Therefore,  the information storage is set as the output value, and the other parameters are set as the input values.Then the partial correlation coefficient is performed to verify the accuracy of the verification and which input is most relevant to the output.<SPAN style="font-size: 20px">Model 2:</SPAN>
The relationship between the time of information storage and the amount of α factor, time, promoting efficiency, the amount of yeast, and amount of alpha yeast was determined by model 1. They divided the experiment into two parts. The first part is that:  a yeast and alpha yeast compete for growth without secretion of alpha factor. The second part is that: in the case of α-factor secretion, the two yeast growth for fighting, and the death rate of α yeast is the expression rate of Bax gene, and the expression rate of Bax gene is related to the start efficiency of the Fig2c promoter. In order to measure the efficiency of the start of the Fig2c promoter, the promoter efficiency of the promoter was measured by the amount of fluorescence by inserting the  fluorescent protein gene of EGFP.</P><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆'; font-size: 18px;"><SPAN style="font-size: 24px">Through</SPAN> the above experimental process, we have established two mathematical models:<SPAN style="font-size: 20px">1)Competition model:</SPAN></P><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆'; font-size: 18px;">    The change trend of OD value of yeast with time was reviewed, taking the maximum value of the slope r1=r2 </P><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆'; font-size: 18px;"><SPAN style="font-size: 20px">2) fighting model:</SPAN></P><P style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Microsoft YaHei UI', 'Microsoft YaHei UI Light', '华文细黑', '微软雅黑', '幼圆'; font-size: 18px;">They putted in different proportions of yeast and calculated the information storage time by modeling. At the same time, the ratio of yeast can be predicted by different storage times. NEFU-China provided a web-based, fully interactive modeling platform that not only provided some information for their wet experiments, but also enabled future iGEM teams to build more efficiently based on our work.
In the laboratory,our team has simulated the exhaust gas ratio which can be found in literatures .The corresponding proportion of the gas was mixed manually and the gas was injected into water to prepare an unsaturated solution.
The content of carbon dioxide in the solution was tested continuously according to the time of the gas entering, and this was used as the data source of our mathematical modeling.

First of all.By using MATLAB to conduct the correlation analysis of the experimental data,we found that the color readings (five dimensions: B, G, R, H, S) showed a certain linear correlation with the concentration of carbon dioxide.This conclusion is consistent with the other conclusion ,which obtains its conclusion by using lambert-beer's absorption law. That is, there is a certain relationship between the substance concentration and the color reading. Secondly, using the multiple regression of statistics to carry out regression analysis on the data, the relationship between the material concentration and the color reading (five-dimensional) is obtained, and the appropriate mathematical expression (or mathematical model) between them is determined as the empirical formula or regression equation.
A mathematical model for determining color readings and carbon dioxide concentration - a linear regression equation. Firstly, a linear regression model between carbon dioxide concentration and color reading is established. The residual of the model is large and the fitting effect is not good.
Considering establishing a nonlinear quadratic regression model.Using the rstool function modeling in the MATLAB statistical toolbox, and evaluating the pros and cons of the model by residual standard deviation and residual. In the final nonlinear quadratic regression model, the residual standard deviation is small, the prediction model is very good, and the residual of the model is reduced by an order of magnitude compared with the multiple linear regression model. Therefore, the linear quadratic regression model is better than the linear regression model. The comparison of the errors of the two models shows that the nonlinear regression quadratic equation has higher precision.
In the process of project communication with each other, we learned that they had a little trouble in modeling. It may be that Northeast Forestry University-China did not fully consider the influence of external factors on the experiment, which led to some errors in the model establishment. Through our tests, we found that the lethal efficiency of their calculations was wrong. After we found the problem, we told them in time and helped them improve the model.
The Northeast Forestry University iGEM team (NEFU-China) also helped us to test the safe reliability of our model. Through this cooperation, the friendship between our two teams was strengthened and the progress of the project was promoted. Both sides regard it as a fairly successful collaboration.Thanks to the iGEM team of Northeast Forestry University (NEFU-China) for their help！</P></NBSP></NBSP></DIV></DIV><DIV id="index_footer"><DIV class="conentff"><UL id="index_foot_list"><LI>TEAM</LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Team">Team Members</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Attributions">Attribution</A></LI></UL><LI>PROJECT</LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Overview">Overview</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Background">Background</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/protocol">Protocol</A></LI><LI><A href="href=" https:="">Design</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Demonstrate">Demonstrate</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/InterLab">Interlab</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Result">Result</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Notebook">Notebook</A></LI><LI>Parts</LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Improve">Improved Parts</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/New_Parts">New Parts</A></LI><LI>Modeling</LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Model">Model</A></LI><LI>HP</LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Human_Practices">Overview</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/HP_FOR_SILVER">HP for Silver</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/INTEGRATED_FOR_GOLD">Integrated HP for Gold</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Public_Engagement">Public Engagement</A></LI><LI>Collaboration</LI><LI><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Collaborations">Collaboration</A></LI><DIV id="index_foot_ahut_info"><P>Anhui University of Technology is located in the national civilized city, Nanjing metropolitan core cities - Ma'anshan City, Anhui Province.
