AHUT_China (This year's project is about carbon dioxide.) With the increasing impact of the greenhouse effect on the global environment,it's very important to know how to efficiently deal with greenhouse gas CO2.Traditional CO2 collection technology is not mature, restricted by high energy consumption and low efficiency.
Our project simulates the protein molecule expressed by the mutation of carbonic anhydrase gene Loci, obtains the high thermal stability of carbonic anhydrase (CA-2) and imports it into Escherichia coli cells to achieve efficient CO2 collection

Fig.2 Learning biological knowledge
On July,2018, we are at the XiangXiangle Art and Culture House, and we had several creative art classes with the children.In class, we studied biology with them and learned creative art courses.By letting children learn the signs of iGEM competition and explaining biological knowledge for them, especially the concepts of genes and synthetic biology, etc.,We encouraged children to add their own ideas to the iGEM logo and use painting to depict genes, synthetic biology, and iGEM competitions in their heart.As shown in Fig.3.
     
     
     
Fig.3 The process of class
After learning the course we designed, every child completed their own works with the guidance of the teacher Long Lijuan and the iGEM team members.

Our Human Practice-- Creative Art Courses in Primary School Students is very meaningful. It not only introduces the iGEM competition, but also introduces the iGEM team of the Anhui University of Technology.And at the same time, this activity guides the children to have a preliminary understanding of life and the corresponding disciplines.
