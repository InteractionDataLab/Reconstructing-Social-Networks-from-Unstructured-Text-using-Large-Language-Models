    1 . HP--Creative Art Course for primary school students
AHUT_China (This year's project is about carbon dioxide.) With the increasing impact of the greenhouse effect on the global environment,it's very important to know how to efficiently deal with greenhouse gas CO2.Traditional CO2 collection technology is not mature, restricted by high energy consumption and low efficiency.
Our project simulates the protein molecule expressed by the mutation of carbonic anhydrase gene Loci, obtains the high thermal stability of carbonic anhydrase (CA-2) and imports it into Escherichia coli cells to achieve efficient CO2 collection

Our Human Practice-- Creative Art Courses in Primary School Students is very meaningful. It not only introduces the iGEM competition, but also introduces the iGEM team of the Anhui University of Technology.And at the same time, this activity guides the children to have a preliminary understanding of life and the corresponding disciplines.
 
 
   2 . We discussed with the AHUT's model airplane team
Currently, our project is still at the laboratory stage, has not yet reached large-scale application.To better seek the scene of large-scale applications, Anhui University of Technology's model airplane team and we held a seminar and developed a program of social practice with the help of the instructor group.

We got in touch with a factory in Maanshan(Maanshan Steel Plant), and a six-rotor drone was provided by the model team, as shown in Fig.8
Fig.8 Six-rotor drone
Zhao Lei, who has studied embedded programming development in the team, has developed a carbon dioxide detection device that can be mounted on the unmanned aerial vehicle with different gas sensors (The gas sensor can detect the mass of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and other gases in each liter.) and STM32 ARM microcontroller. As shown in Fig.9:
Fig.9 Gas detection device
We used this drone to carry the detection device into the air and tested it near the end of the factory's exhaust system. It was found that the concentration of carbon dioxide near the smoke extraction device was extremely high, 5-20 times greater than the normal value. According to the document "National Greenhouse Gas Emissions Accounting and Reporting and Other 11 Greenhouse Gas Management National Standards Released", the proportion of various costs in the exhaust gas from such a plant's production process is: oxygen: carbon dioxide: sulfur dioxide: vulcanization Hydrogen: Carbon monoxide: Hydrogen chloride: Fluoride: Nitrogen oxides: Other = 14:10:3:3:3:2:3:8:54, We have measured the composition, content and mass percentage of each gas in the factory exhaust gas after averaging as follows:

The detected gas content proves the correctness of the literature data, which was simulated in the laboratory according to the proportion of gas in the exhaust gas in the literature. A proportionate gas is manually mixed and passed through water to prepare an unsaturated solution. Depending on the time of access, the amount of carbon dioxide in the solution is continuously tested and used as a source of data for our mathematical modeling. See our Mathematical Modeling page for details. 
 
 
 
 
    3. Paying Visit to Biochemical Research Center and Discuss Project with Professor Xia Xu
On Sept.26,2018,members of the Team AHUT_China were very honored to visit the biochemical research center and visit professor Xia Xu.Professor Xu is a doctoral supervisor.Her research direction is mainly based on molecular simulation,which is designed for drug delivery, CO2 capture and transformation, biological materials,anti-microbial, disease treatment and functional polypeptide in vitro-detection, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, microfluidics, online detection technology and so on.
We communicated with Prof. Xu about the project of absorbing CO2 in the air by introducing the synthetic modified carbonic anhydrase gene into escherichia coli and raised some relevant questions, and she gave us detailed answers.Here were our interview content.
Fig.10 Discusstion with Pro.Xia Xu
①Q:The laboratory has synthesized the gene sequence of human carbonic anhydrase by the total synthesis method, which, as far as we know, is a little bit different from the original one. May I ask you what these differences are?
A:Compared with the natural one, the synthetic gene of human carbonic anhydrase by the total synthesis method replaces the 203rd amino acid.As a result,the synthetic gene performs more stable when exposed at high temperatures.Our main application scenario is in the factory, so the modified human carbonic anhydrase must be highly active under such conditions.
②Q:Our project is to introduce the full synthetic gene sequence of human carbonic anhydrase into escherichia coli through psb1c3 carrier to achieve the goal of absorbing CO2 in the air through carbonic anhydrase. Therefore, we want to get some information about the frontier in this field home and abroad, for instance, the technology of absorbing CO2 in the air through biology or other methods and so on.
A:So far, the most advanced way in the world uses algae as the carrier for absorption, and researchers have made detailed explanations.In the past, many studies used plant carbonic anhydrase to capture CO2.Though this kind of carbonic anhydrase can survive in most environments,yet efficiency of human carbonic anhydrase for capturing CO2 is dozens of times higher than that of the plant one.
③Q:The major scientific research direction of biochemical research center.
A:It can be concluded as drug delivery, CO2 capture and conversion, biomaterials and regenerative medicine.
④Q:As far as we know, the carbonic anhydrase expressed in escherichia coli in our iGEM project is more active than that did in human body. This is because of the effect of modifying the active site based on the carbonic anhydrase expressed in human body. Therefore, we want to know how to find out the relevant active site to improve the activity of carbonic anhydrase by computer.
A:The relevant active sites of carbonic anhydrase are known in the knowledge base. We use computer to simulate mutation of the known active sites of carbonic anhydrase to see if it can improve its function, which is verified by conducting relevant experiments later.Our workload and efficiency can be reduced and improved by computer simulation.

After that, Prof. Xu guided us to visit the molecular cells and experimental operation area in the biochemical research center.She showed us relevant experimental equipment and operation process, and then we used the enzyme marker to measure the absorbance and fluorescence of bacterial liquid under her guidance. We became more interested in biology and chemical engineering after this visit and the collaboration among our team members have been improved as well.

     5. Lecture on iGEM in Anhui University of Technology (AHUT_China)
Time:  3.30p.m. on Sept. 11, 2018, Tuesday
Location: Conference Room in the Innovative Education Faculty
We held a lecture aiming at letting more people know about synthetic biology and iGEM. With great honor, we invited Dr. Pei hao, who is currently working in the school of engineering and applied sciences in Harvard University and engaging in the application of microfluidics in biomedical field, to give students in AHUT this lecture. It has successfully attracted interests of hundreds of students, but due to the limited seats in the meeting room, we had to invited only more than 60 students to attend this speech. In order to enable more people to watch the lecture, we took advantage of the webcast platform, making more than 1,000 people enjoy this meeting online. Dr. Pei not only presented us the research progress of microfluidics but also shared teachers and students with the current research results.

Microfluidics Technology refers to the technology of controlling, operating and detecting complex fluids at the micro size. It is a newly interdisciplinary subject developed on the basis of microelectronics, micromechanics, bioengineering and nanotechnology. The rapid development of Microfluidics Technology in recent years has stricken revolutionary impacts in the fields of chemistry, medicine and life science. Biochips are regarded as an important tool for interpretating gene sequences in the Post-Genome Era and microfluidics chips are also known as "lab-on-a-chip", which use MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) technology for mixing the separated purification used in general laboratories and miniaturize devices such as enzyme reactions onto the chip for biochemical reactions, process control or analysis. The construction of this kind of chip is far more complex than microarray chips. According to ranges of its application, the chip can be further divided into three categories: sample pretreatment chip, reactive chip and analytical chip. They can perform complex and precise operations on microfluids (both liquid and gas), such as mixing and separation of microfluids, chemical reactions, microanalysis, etc. Besides, microfluidics chips also play a unique role in the screening of rare cells, the extraction and purification of MRNA, gene sequencing, single-cell analysis, and protein crystallization. They have been widely used in biotechnology research due to their lightweight, less sample or trial dose usage, fast reaction speed, large parallel processing and disposable features.
After the lecture, we conducted a questionnaire survey among participated students. From the feedback of more than 1,000 questionnaires collected, we can see that hundreds of students are full of interest in synthetic biology through this lecture, and students of different majors have made determination to take part in iGEM next year. (the questionnaire is followed)
