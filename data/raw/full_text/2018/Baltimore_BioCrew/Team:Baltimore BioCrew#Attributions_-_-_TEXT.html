SUMMARY
Attribution
The Baltimore Bio-Crew would like to thank each of its generous mentors and advisors for helping us make this project possible.
Dr. Lisa Scheifele: Executive Director of Baltimore Underground Science Space (BUGSS) and Primary PI, assisted in the overall management of the team, funding and with lab experiments.
Dr. Sarah Laun: Former Lab Manager of Baltimore Underground Science Space (BUGSS) and Secondary PI, assisted in overall management of the team, as well as teaching students about basic lab protocols, synthetic biology, and iGEM.
Dr. Tom Burkett: Chair of the Board at the Baltimore Underground Science Space (BUGSS) and Primary PI, assisted with lab experiments.
Dr. Frank Burns: Mentor for the Interlab students, taught students how to use the Interlab and run assays.
Wangui Mbuguiro: Mentor for the Math Modeling students, assisted us in learning and using math modeling to gain a better understanding on how to implement our project.
Nina Rajpurohit: Mentor for the Clot Breaking, assisted us in creating our constructs and lab experiments such as cloning.
Ed Zavala: Mentor for the Clot Breaking students, assisted us in creating our constructs and lab experiments such as cloning.
Dr. Thomas O’Neill: Mentor for the Clot Making students, assisted us in creating our constructs and lab protocols.
We would also like to give a special thanks to these leading healthcare professionals who came to BUGSS to give us feedback on our project.
Dr. Thomas M. Scalea: Shock Trauma’s physician-in-chief at the University of Maryland Medical Center, gave us valuable feedback on the potential of our project as well as connected us with the Stop the Bleed Campaign.
Alayna Blazakis: Nurse Practitioner, taught us more about the effects and uses of tPA as well as potential applications for our serum protease.
Team from Feilim Mac Gabhann’s Lab: Researchers that gave us comments about and helped our math modeling team.
Lastly, we would like to thank the iGEM teams who have inspired us or aided us in our project.
Lethbridge HS 2016: Their project on blood coagulation using serum protease inspired us to put our own spin to the topic. We would like to thank Dr. Brian Dempsey for his support in our development of the project.
iTesla 2018: Their hard work, diligence, and dedication to the iGEM Guide has helped us to create a detailed report for potential community laboratories interested in hosting an iGEM team. We are very thankful for their support.
A Final Note
While our mentors were an immense help with planning and educating our team, we would like to note that every experiment, PCR, Gel Electrophoresis, or anything else was student run. Thank you to everyone who helped us along the way.
