SUMMARY
Basic Parts
Medium Promoter (BBa_J23100): a section of DNA responsible for beginning the process of forming mRNA and proteins.
RBS Strong (BBa_B0030): an RNA sequence found in mRNA to which ribosomes can bind and initiate translation. It is a sequence of nucleotides upstream of the start codon of an mRNA transcript that is responsible for the recruitment of a ribosome during the initiation of protein translation.
PelB Secretion Tag (BBa_J32015): allows for bacteria to secrete the enzymes (Cerastocytin and Russell’s Viper Venom Serine Protease) into the periplasm. Once the enzymes are secreted to the periplasm, they are able to exit the cell on their own.
Russell’s Viper Venom- Serine protease (BBa_K2893009): the DNA sequence of our serine protease. This enzyme is needed to coagulate mammalian blood.
His-Tag (BBa_K1223006): allows us to purify our protein using a nickel column.
Fibrin Peptide-alpha- GPRP-optimized (BBa_K2893007): one of two parts that allows us to localize the construct around a central point.
DsBC - Thiol isomerase + periplasmic signal (BBa_K2893008): one of two parts that allows us to localize the construct around a central point.
Double Terminator (BBa_B0010, BBa_B0012): a sequence that occurs at the end of the gene and causes transcription to stop
LacI Promoter (BBa_ R0010): a DNA sequence that starts the transcription process in the presence of lactose or IPTG. Thus, the promoter is only active in certain times to regulate the amount of proteins the bacteria is able to produce at a time. The promoter causes the gene to activate and begin the process of forming mRNA and eventually proteins.
Cerastocytin coding sequence optimized for E.coli (BBa_ K2893006): the DNA sequence of our Cerastocytin enzyme, which is needed to coagulate mammalian blood.
