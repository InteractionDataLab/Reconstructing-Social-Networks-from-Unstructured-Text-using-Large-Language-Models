June 23
Clot Makers
We found that we may not need to order any BioBricks, as Lethbridge only used the sequences of the parts, and then proceeded synthesized them. We decided that we want
some more time to determine what we need to send for synthesis, as we want to be exact with what we need. We also decided some different ways to continue the second construct, which Lethbridge never got to test. We want to add purification tags to both construct one (clotting blood) and construct two (localizing the clot). We could use Histags, and in construct two we need Factor 13, an antimicrobial peptide.
Clot Breakers
Talked about specific direction for project
Requested TPA part from IGEM
Talked about goal to reduce the side effects of TPA by making it more targeted (make TPA only function in low oxygen tension next to blood clot)
Interlab
Signed up for interlab (Baltimore Bio-Crew)
Creating contact list to purchase absorbance filter D for plate reader
Interviewed clot breakers and clot makers for potential assays
Wiki
Wrote a first draft of the project description
Filled out as much as possible of safety form
Discussed wiki design
Human Practices
Came up with ideas and people to contact
June 30
Clot Makers
We began looking at places/people we could contact who we can ask for more insight into potential applications for our project. We sent an email to Dr. Lavik, who is
knowledgeable about using nanoparticles to increase the rate of coagulation and lessen the possibility of infection and inflammation. We also talked a little bit about a potential way to test the effectiveness of the enzymes we produce with our constructs. We also introduced the idea of potentially adding a numbing agent into the construct.
Clot Breakers
Designed and ordered primers
Researched more about redox switches
Interlab
We looked at the interlab protocol and verified that our machine has all of the settings and requirements to participate EXCEPT for the Filter D for absorbance
We successfully poured 20 plates with Chlor antibiotic for next Saturday transformations
Understanding the interlab this year and why its important

Clot Makers
Designed a potential assay to test the effectiveness of the clotting agent in a simulated injury scenario
Discussed other assays that could potentially be used through all stages of testing
Ordered our constructs
Clot Breakers
Discussed gene design and looked for bacterial promoters to use
Need to find bacterial promoters to replace the mammalian promoter on the the TPA gene
Miniprepped TPA plasmids from last time using Monarch Plasmid Miniprep Kit
Measured concentration of DNA with nanodrop
Nanodrop Results: E: 57.0 ng/uL  Purity: 1.74 J: 39.8 ng/uL  Purity: 1.78 Z 75.8 ng/uL  Purity: 1.71
Digested DNA in 1 spot in order to open the plasmids so that we would be able to see the length of them on a gel later
Used Typical RD Protocol from NEB
Ran a gel electrophoresis on a 1% gel of the three digests and one lane of uncut plasmid
Interlab
Finished calibration protocol for absorbance and fluorescence to obtain needed measurement parameters for our experiment
Absorbance settings:
Room temperature
ABS 550 on plate reader (excitation 535)
Fluorescence settings:
Room temperature
Reading from top
Optimal reading
Complete protocol for absorbance/fluorescence for parts 1-6 (not controls) and recorded data
(Incubated ½ samples for 6 hours in 37* incubator, and on ice for as 0 hour time point)
Made ~40 Chlor plates for next week interlab and CFU protocol
July 21
Clot Makers
Completed task list for weeks coming up
Edited clot making ppt for presentation on August 11
Clot Breakers
Tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA) genes were designed
Interlab
We finished all calculations for LB+Chlor media
Finished taking absorbance and fluorescence of time point 0 hours data
We made 70% alcohol
Labeled and prepped plates and tubes for CFU protocol
Example of label -1a/ - = Negative control 1= (1st set), a= first replicate
Completing dilutions for protocol and then needs to plate
.1 dilution was not precise, here is the absorbance data from that (measuring 550ABS)
July 28
Clot Breakers
LWe checked the sequence of the TPA we amplified by aligning it to the biobrick parts sequence.
We used Clustal Omega to do this.
We checked from around 580 bp to the end and everything was great (almost perfect matches).
We also checked the quality of the sequence using a chromatography viewer. (Quality was very good)
Next Step: Will request that VF2 sample be resequenced
Elena’s guest lecture
Areas to look more into:
Learned that tPA is very potent and only used as a treatment in high-risk/severe stroke cases. What makes it so potent? Is there a way to modify that aspect?
Methods of delivery for tPA?  Literature shows some use for targeted treatment of blood clots. (Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28796540)

3) TPA with weak constitutively active promoter
