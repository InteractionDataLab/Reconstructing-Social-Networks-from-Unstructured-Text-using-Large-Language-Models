Collaboration with CCA San Diego iGEM Team
During the 2017-2018 iGEM season, our team, TPHS-San Diego, collaborated with the CCA-San Diego iGEM team. During the collaboration, we discussed numerous issues such as part submission, team wiki troubleshooting, and safety precautions. For part submission, our team received help with the process of submitting the part on the part registry page. They were able to instruct us on this, and as a result, we were able to successfully submit the part. In addition, there were some aspects of coding the wiki that both of our teams needed to work out. Through our collaboration, both of our teams were able to improve upon our website design. Finally, we decided to make a compilation of videos that would be helpful to future iGEM teams, and our team created a lab safety component of the video included in the overall video for iGEM.
