Collaborations
CSU_CHINA
In June, they held the First iGEM Meetup in Hunan Region. We mentored them on organizing the team and shared experience in the competition. In July, we had Interlab activities, shared Escherichia coil DH5a cells and showed them around our biology laboratory. Our collaboration can also be seen on their wiki page ( https://2018.igem.org/Team:CSU_CHINA/Collaborations ).
SMMU-China
In August, we were invited to have a communication with SMMU-China. As they were a greenhand in iGEM, we introduced the process of competition, presented our project and shared our experience in team building with them. After the communication in experiments, results and future work, we received inspiring ideas from their teachers and gave comments on their project. We got to know more about each other not only academically, but also in friendship. Our communication is also recorded on their wiki page ( https://2018.igem.org/Team:SMMU-China/Collaborations ).
Tianjin, ZJU-China, OUC-China, Jilin_China, XJTU-China
With the proposal of team Tianjin team, six universities worked together to make research on how the laboratory results are converted to market products. We conducted market research on the products based on fundamental study and then investigated the evaluation mechanism. The final report of commercialization of research findings worked as a reference guide for foundational advance.
The body of the report is the analysis and research of this transformation process (with theory and case study) and our projects. The theoretical part was completed by iGEM Tianjin and our team. For our work, please go to our Human Practices Page . For the final report, please go to https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tianjin/Collaborations .
CCiC
In the end of August, we attended the Fifth Conference of China iGEMer Community held by ShanghaiTech. We were inspired by the wonderful lectures delivered by professors and scholars. The presentation session gave us an opportunity to express ourselves before Giant Jamboree as well as learning from other teams in China. During the poster session, we had face-to-face conversations with other iGEMers, some of whom offered suggestions on promotion.  After the conference, we began to work on developing new and thoughtful ways of Human Practices, establishing a more systematic model, and making modifications on designing of our poster and wiki. We were lucky to communicate with iGEM HQ, Meagan Lizarazo, and took photos with her.
NJU-China
They shared A549 cells, which could verify the demo of our system. In return, we offered suggestions on their project and helped them carry out the cell viability experiment. It was proven that their manipulation did no harm to cells, which set up a good start of their project. Their acknowledgement can be found on their wiki page ( https://2018.igem.org/Team:NJU-China/Collaborations ).
OUC-China
We distributed brochures named SPACESHIP E.coli made by team OUC-China, hoping to increase publicity of synthetic biology. The brochure is a comic book and fun to look through and discuss with other readers. It really worked in intriguing students’ enthusiasm for synthetic biology. (see more on Education Page )
