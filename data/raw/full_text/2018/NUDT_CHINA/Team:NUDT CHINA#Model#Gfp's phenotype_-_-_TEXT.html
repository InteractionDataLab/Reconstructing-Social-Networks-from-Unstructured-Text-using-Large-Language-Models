Methods to specifically disrupt protein function have greatly accelerated the systematic researches of protein function and interaction work. There are mainly two approaches utilized to disrupt protein function nowadays: DNA knockout and RNA interference, which act at the genome and mRNA level, respectively.However, these two methods both function slowly and indirectly, giving cells enough time to activate compensatory pathway, this may allow the turnover of target protein and cover protein-related phenotypes. Therefore, a method that directly regulates protein levels is urgently needed. Here, we present a target protein disruption method, which degrade endogenous target proteins acutely in mammalian cells.
