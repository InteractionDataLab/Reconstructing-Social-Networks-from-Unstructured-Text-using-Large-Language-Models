Model
Designed Protein Degradation Method Based on
Trim21 And Nanobody              -- Model
Our Work
Our innovative project present a target protein disruption method in order to degrade endogenous target proteins acutely in mammalian cells. To explain and predict the possibilities within the wetlab limits,we built ODE models and applied our measured data to parameters simulation method based on Bayesian parameter estimation to obtain parameters which fits our reality better. We use this model to obtain the relation between the expression time of plasmid and protein degradation rate,making it accessible to future teams who want to incorporate our minds into their designs. Through the modeling ,we understand the reaction mechanism more specifically and obtain how different factors influence the degradation process .This model also offers guidelines on choosing detection point and future clinical application.
