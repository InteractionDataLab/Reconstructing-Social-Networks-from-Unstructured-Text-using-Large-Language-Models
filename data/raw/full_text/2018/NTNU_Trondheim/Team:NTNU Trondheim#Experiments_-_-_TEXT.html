Transfer successful transformed cells to LB-medium and preparation of standard curves for the InterLab study
Goal:
Inoculate successful transformed competent cells to LB-medium, and prepare the standard curves for InterLab study.
Procedure:
Inoculate colony from agar plates to LB-medium:
A colony from each agar plate was selected and inoculated to LB- medium with antibiotics. Competent cells with pgRNA were transferred to LB- medium with AMP, while competent cells with pdCas9 were inoculated into LB- medium with CM. The cell cultures were incubated at 37℃ with shaker.
Preparation of 1xPBS solution for the InterLab-study.
Preparation of agar plates with CM, LA- and LB-medium.
Preparation of standard curves for InterLab study:
Calibration 1: OD 600 reference point – LUDOX protocol
A conversion factor to transform absorbance data from plate reader into OD600 was obtained in spectrometer by measuring four replicates of LUDOX CL-X and ddH2O. The data were imported into Excel sheet.
Calibration 2: Particle standard curve – Microsphere protocol
The solution of silica beads provided in the kit from iGEM HQ, was vortexed before dilution with water (96 μL Silica beads in 904 μL dd H2O). A serial dilution of microspheres was obtained by adding 100 μL dd H2O into 4x11 wells (E2, F2, G2, H2…E12, F12, G12, H12) on a 96 well plate. Microsphere stock solution (200 μL) was pipetted into E1 and 100 μL of the solution was transferred to E2 and mixed well before transferring 100 μL to E3. The procedure repeated until 100 μL solution was pipetted into E11, and 100 μL was transferred to liquid waste. The dilution series was repeated for row F, G and H. The absorbance of the samples was measured by a plate reader with shaker at 24℃. The data were exported to Excel sheet.

Isolation of pgRNA and pdCas9 from compentent cells (DH5α) and preparation of stock solution for calibration 3 for InterLab study
Goal:
Isolate plasmids from competent cells (DH5α), and prepare the fluorecein stock solution for InterLab study.
Procedure:
Dilution of cell cultures:
Each cell cultures (successful transformed competent cells from day 5 – 26.06.2018) (2.5 mL) were transferred into fresh LB-medium (22.5 mL) with CM (22.5 μL). The new cultures were incubated for about 2 hours at 37℃ with shaking .
Measurement of the cell density:
The cell density of the new cultures was measured at OD 600, after calibration with water (blank sample).
Plasmid isolation and determination of concentration:
The plasmids were isolated from the competent cell after the protocol of ZR plasmid miniprep kit (see lab journal from day 3 - 22. June. 2018).
The concentration of the plasmids was determined by using Nanodrop.
Restriction digest:
The plasmids from each culture (5 μL) were digested by mixing with 10xbuffer (2 μL), distilled water (12.5 μL) and restriction enzyme BspHI (0.5 μL). The solution was centrifuged down before the samples were incubated over night at 37℃.

Plasmid verification and storing the cell cultures
Goal:
Verify that the successfully transformed DH5α cells carry pgRNA or pdCas9, and store the cell cultures for future use.
Procedure:
Plasmid verification:
The digested plasmid samples from yesterday’s incubation (lab 6 – 27. June.2018) were separated by gel electrophoresis.
Bacteria glycerol stocks:
The cell cultures made from 27. June were stored in a glycerol stock (500 µL cell culture and 500 µL 50% glycerol) in the freezer at -80℃.
Results:
Plasmid verification:
L, pR1, pR2, pC1 and pC2 are the DNA-fragments from ladder solution, the two samples of pgRNA and pdCas9, respectively. From Figure 1 the two fragments with 1.5 kb and 1.0 kb were found from the fragments of pgRNA after digestion by BspHI. The fragment with 100 bp from the digested pgRNA is not visible on the gel, probably due to masking of the dye colour at the bottom of the gel. Two bands from the digested pdCas9 with 2.7 kb and 4 kb were also detected. By comparing the results og gel elecrophoresis obtained from today's experiment with the results from day 3 (22. June. 2018), one can clearly see that the bands with the expected length from successful transformed competent cells, are much clearer. Hence, this also indicate the samples from the successful transformed DH5α cells are purer, which is also true by comparing the results from Nanodrop (see day 6 - 27. June. 2018, and day 3 - 22. June. 2018).

Separation, isolation and transformation of linear DNA (pgRNA with anti-luxS)
Goal:
Separate the PCR product from circular DNA
Isolate the linear DNA (pgRNA with anti-luxS from the gel
Transform the linear DNA into competent cells
InterLab study - transformation of plasmids to competent cells
Procedure:
Separation of linear DNA from circular DNA:
The leaner DNA obtained from PCR (from day 8 – 29. June. 2018), was separated from the circular DNA (original plasmids) after running the sample (25 μL) mixed with loading dye (5 μl) on gel electrophoresis (gelGreen) simultaneously with a ladder (1 μL gene ruler + 1 μL loading dye + 4 μL dH2O) for 50 min at 90 V. The sample and the ladder were prepared by the gel electrophoresis protocol.
Gel digestion and DNA isolation:
The agarose was digested and the DNA was isolated from the sample following the gel purification protocol.
Determine the DNA concentration and purity:
The concentration and the purity of the isolated DNA was determined by using Nanodrop.
Transformation of PCR product to competent cells: The PCR product (5 μL) was transformed to competent cells after following the transformation protocol.
InterLab – transformation of plasmids to competent cells:
The plasmids listed on the protocol, was transformed into competent cells (DH5α) after the following protocol:
Thaw the competent cells on ice (10 min), and pre-chill the eppendorf tubes.
Resuspend the DNA in the wells (provided by iGEM HQ) with dH2O (10 μL).
Add competent cells (50 μL) to the eppendorf tubes.
Add resuspended DNA (1 μL) to the Eppendorf tubes.
Incubate on ice for 25 min
Heat shock the cells for 45 s at 42℃ in water bath
Incubate on ice for 5 min.
Add LB-medium (950μL) to the tubes
Incubate for 1h at 37℃ with shacker
Pipette each sample (100 μL) to agar plate with CM
Centrifuge the samples for 3 min at 6800g, discard supernatant (800 μL) and resuspend the pellet with the remaining supernatant
Pipette each sample (100 μL) to agar plate with CM
Incubate overnight at 37℃.
Results:
Separation of linear DNA from circular DNA:
Figure 1 shows the image of the gel where the linearized DNA was separated from the circular DNA. The linearized DNA is approximately 2 kb. The linearized DNA fragment was then cut out from the gel and stored in eppendorf tube.
Note! Due to UV-light exposure, the DNA may mutate. In this case, this may affect the later steps of our project. The worse scenario, mutation of anti-luxS. Hence our CSRPRi system may not recognize luxS in the bacteria. Biofilm production will not be inhibited…
Determine the DNA concentration and purity:
Table 1 shows the results of the linear pgRNA (2) from PCR (probably with anti-luxS gene).

From the 260/230 ratio, the sample has a relatively a small amount of nucleic acids. Probably, it is contaminated by the agarose from the gel electrophoresis. On the other hand, the 260/280 ratio is ok, indicating that the sample contains a relatively larger amount of RNA than DNA. InterLab – transformation of plasmids to competent cells:
No visible colonies were detected on agar plates, except the positive and negative control cells.

Inoculation of successful transformed competent cells and InterLab study
Goal:
Inoculate colonies of successful transformed competent cells
InterLab study - transformation of plasmids to competent cells
Procedure:
InterLab – transformation of plasmids to competent cells:
No visible cell colonies were formed on the agar plates that were incubated on day 9 - 02. Junly. 2018. Only the positive and negative control cells formed colonies.
Therefore, the remaining plasmids (6 μL) were transformed to the competent cells and plated on agar based on the same protocol from day 2. Jul. 2018. During the incubation at 37℃ with shaker, the incubation time was extended to 2 h. The cell cultures were centrifuged, and 700 μL supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were resuspended with the remaining supernatant. The cell cultures were then plated on agar plated with CM, and incubated overnight at 37℃.
Inoculation of successful transformed competent cells:
Colonies of successful transformed competent cells with pgRNA (probably containing anti-luxS) were inoculated from the agar plates (from day 9 – 02. July. 2018) to LB-medium with AMP. The cell cultures were incubated with shaker overnight at 37℃.

Verification of successful inserted anti-luxS in pgRNA
Goal:
InterLab - transformation of plasmids into competent cells
Verification of succsesful insertion of anti-luxS in pgRNA(2)
Procedure:
InterLab – Transformation of plasmids to competent cells
There has been a mistake of numbering the plates with plasmids provided by iGEM HQ. Therefore, we did not get any cell colonies from the previous two transformations…
The plasmids (1.5 μL) from the right wells were transformed to competent cells by following the transformation protocol from day – 02. July. 2018, after resuspension of the plasmids in the wells.
Cell density:
The cell cultures with pgRNA(2) (probably with anti-luxS), inoculated from day 10 – 04. July. 2018, were diluted 10 times by following the same dilution procedure from day 6 – 27. June. 2018. The cells were incubated with shaker for 1h before measuring at OD 600.
Plasmid isolation:
The plasmids from the two cell cultures were isolated after the same mini-prep protocol from day 3 – 22. June. 2018. The concentration and the purity of the isolated plasmids were measured by Nanodrop.
Restriction digest and gel elecrophoresis:
Insertion of anti-luxS gene was verified after the protocol of restriction digest and gel electrophoresis (see the protocols from day 3 – 22. June. 2018). The restriction enzyme PstI was chosen, and the expected length of the plasmid fragments are 490 bp and 2094 bp.
Note! PstI has a cut site at the anti-luxS gene in the plasmid.
Bacteria glycerol stock:
Two samples of the diluted cell cultures (made at this morning), were stored in 50% glycerol solution at -80℃ (the same green box with the other successful transformed cells with pgRNA (without anti-luxS) or cells with pdCas9 plasmids).
Results:

Double transformation and InterLab study - Inoculation
Goal:
Transform both pdCas9 and pgRNA with anti-luxS into competent cells
InterLab study - inoculate colonies in LB-medium
Procedure:
Double transformation of pdCas9 and pgRNA with anti-luxS:
Both pdCas9(2) and pgRNA(2) with anti-luxS (isolated from day 11 – 05. July. 2018) were simultaneously transformed into competent cells (DH5α). The amount of added pdCas9(2) (5 μL) and pgRNA(2) with anti-luxS was 5 µL per/plasmid, and it was added to the same tube containing competent cells. The cells were plated on agar with both AMP and CM. A couple of steps were added at the end, and the purpose was to increase the cell concentration plated on agar, and probably increase the possibility of colony formation. The cell culture was therefore centrifuged for 3 minutes at 6800g, and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was then resuspended and cells were plated.
InterLab – Inoculation of colonies
A colony from each agar plate was inoculated in LB-medium (5 mL) with CM (5 μL). The cell cultures were incubated overnight at 37℃ with shaker.

Procedure:
Inoculation of successful double transformed cells
A colony from each agar plates with AMP and CM (made from day 13 – 05. July 2018) was picked and inoculated in LB medium (20 mL) with AMP (25 μL) and CM (25 μL).
The cell cultures were incubated at 37℃ with shaker.
InterLab – Cell measurement
We were not able to measure the cell cultures today, since the TECAN device was under reparation.

Procedure:
Dilution of cell culture:
Each cell cultures, inoculated and incubated from day 13 – 07. July. 2018, were diluted (1mL) with LB medium with antibiotics until the OD 600 reached 1.9.
Plasmid verification:
Plasmid isolation:
The plasmids were isolated from each cell cultures after following the mini-prep plasmid protocol from day 3 – 22. June. 2018. The concentration and the purity of the samples were determined by Nanodrop.
Restriction digest and gel electrophoresis:
The plasmids in each sample were digested with restriction enzymes BamHI-HF and PstI with the following ingredients and amounts:
7.1 μL              Plasmids
0.5 μL             PstI
0.5 μL              BamHI-HF
2 μL                 NEBuffer 1.1
10.4 μL            ddH2O
The samples were incubated for 1.5 h at 37℃.
Note! NEBbuffer 1.1 was chosen instead of Cut smart since the activity of PstI in Cut smart was 50%.
The activity of the enzymes in NEBbuffer 1.1:
BamHI-HF: 100%
PstI:75%
After the plasmids have been degraded by restriction enzymes, the fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis.

Colony picking biobrick (test) and transformation
Goal :
1. Get colonies of the transformed DH5α (biobrick)  2. Get colonies on the negative control plate
Procedure:
1. Due to the lack of colonies on the negative control plates, new plates was streaked.
2. New LA-plates without antibiotics were made.
3. Colonypicking the two colonies from the plates with the transformed bacteria in to liquid medium.
4. The transformation of bacteria with the biobrick plasmid was redone on four plates because of the lack of growth on the plates (see 16.07.18).
Results:
There were more colonies on the four new plates, and they were light red as well (About 20 colonies). The new negative control plates had colonies as well.

RFP biobrick fluorescens measurement (test)
Goal:
1. To get a descriptive curve for the rise in fluorescens (transformed DH5α)
2. Find out how often the measurements need to be done.
Procedure:
The second batch of plates from transformation and the negative control:
1. Colonypicking and exchange to liquid medium
Measurements of the first batch (Tecan):
1. Measured the OD of the blank (LB and CM), and measured the OD of the two cultures.
2. For the next measurements we diluted the cultures by 1:100 in separate tubes.
3. Incubation of the tubes
4. The first measurement was done in the Tecan, and repeated for every 30 minutes and then 1 hour (because of minor changes in values)
5. The measurements was set overnight as well using the following script: FluorescenceLong. The data was set to 588 nm absorbance, 584 nm excitation, 607 nm emission, 37°C, 40 gain, 150 kinetic cycles, 300s shaking (orbital 3 mm amplitude).
Results:
The second batch from transformation has turned red. From the measurements of the test batch we have an idea of the increase in fluorescence intensity and the change in absorbance over time. This can be used to determine the timing of the second batch with the negative control as well.

Biobrick: Preparations, Fluoresence microscopy
Goal:
Prepare for measurements tomorrow.
Learn about fluorescence microscopy
Procedure:
Preparations:
Made LA-petri dishes with CM. Diluted cultures of the biobrick Bba_J04450 and negative control and incubated them at 37°C overnight.
Demonstration and training in fluorescence microscopy:
Astrid Bjørkøy showed us how to use the fluorescence microscope, and we tried it out by taking photos of cultures of the Bba_J04450 biobrick. She also told us how to count cells by adjusting a photo's threshold and calculate based on image size.
Results:
The biobrick Bba_J004450 was very bright. We used excitation 561 nm and emission ca 625-680 nm as the biobrick was too bright at emission 607 nm. Consider using another laser further away from excitation point (584 nm) for the real photos of the biobrick, and the improved biobrick.

Biobrick: Red Fluorescent Protein measurement (FAILED)
Goal:
Measure the expression of the Bba_J04450 biobrick in transformed dH5α cells. This is done by measuring fluorescence.
Procedure:
1. Incubated dH5α, J04450 transformed cells were dilluted 1:100 with LB
2. 200 µL, 5 replicates of LB, LB with Chloramphenicol and 5 dH5α dillutions made from different batches were applied to a 96 well plate
3. Tecan plate reader was used to measure absorbance at 588 nm and fluorescence at excitation 584 nm and emission 607 nm with the following parameters:
Temperature: 37,0°C, varying from 36,5°C to 37,5°C
Kinetic cycles: 750
Gain: 40
Z position: 18055 µM
Shaking: 300 s
Orbital shaking amplitude: 3 mm
Results:
The wells dried out, presumably due to us choosing not to use a lid on the plate, and the measurements were therefore aborted by the machine.

Ligation of mutated pdCas9 and pSB1C3, plasmid isolation, digestion of mutated pdCas9 and pSB1C3
Goal:
Ligation of enzymatic digested pSB1C3 and mutated pdCas9
Plasmid isolation from overnight cultures
Digest the mutated pdCas9 and pSB1C3 with restriction enzymes
Procedure:
Ligation of DNA fragments:
According to the protocol for ligation of DNA fragments, the amount of the fragments was calculated by using the NEBiocalculator.
We assume that all of the DNA is completely cut by the enzymes, so we have 400 ng dCas9 and 250 ng digested backbone
The concentration of PC2 is 40 ng/μL and 10 μL pdCas9 was cut with enzymes, while the concentration of linear pSB1C3 was 25 ng/ μL and 10 μL was digested.
If we would like to have 25 ng backbone in the reaction solution, we should have approx. 181.3 ng dCas9 according to NEBiocalculator with the ratio of 3:1 for insert and backbone.
The theoretical concentration of the digested pdCas9 is 20 ng/ μL (total 400 ng plasmid was cut, and the final volume in the restriction digest tube was 20 μL), and 12.5 ng/ μL for the digested pSB1C3 (total 250 ng linear pSB1C3 was cut, and the final volume in the restriction digest tube was 20 μL).
Thus, the volume of the different compounds for ligation is
2 μL T4 DNA ligase buffer
1 μL T4 DNA ligase
2 μL Backbone
10 μL dCas9
5 μL ddH2O
Total volume: 20 μL
The sample was incubated at 16 ℃ overnight
P.S. The fragments were not separated on gel before ligation (after so many times of failure to isolate DNA from gel…), wrong insert or re-ligation of pdCas9 fragments may occur…
Plasmid isolation from competent cells:
The plasmid with mutated pdCas9 was isolated from two cell cultures by following the same procedure from 02.07.2018.
Enzymatic digestion of mutated psCas9 and linear pSB1C3:
PCI: 17 μL DNA, 2 μL 2.1 buffer, 0.5 μL EcoRI, 0.5 μL PstI
Dried linearized pSB1C3 was resuspended with 10 μL ddH2O to obtain the final concentration 100 ng/ μL
pSB1C3: 9 μL DNA (100 ng/ μL), 2 μL 2.1 buffer, 0.5 μL EcoRI, 0.5 μL PstI, 8 μL ddH2O
The samples were incubated overnight at 37 ℃.

Goal:
Separation of DNA fragments on gel
Gel digestion and DNA isolation of dCas9 and pSB1C3
Transformation of ligation product
Amplify mutated dCas9 and linear pSB1C3
Procedure:
Gel electrophoresis:
Enzymatically digested pdCas9 and pSB1C3 (prepared from yesterday - 23.09.2018) were separated on gel green at 90 V for 45 min.
Gel digestion and DNA isolation:
The desired fragments of dCas9 and backbone were cut out from the gel. The DNA fragments were further isolated by following after the same procedure fromn02.07.2018.
Transformation of ligation product into competent cells:
Heat inactivate the ligase at 65 ℃ for 20 min Transform 5 μL of ligation product into competent cells by following the protocol from 25.06.2018 P.S. The fragments were not separated on gel before ligation (after so many times of failure to isolate DNA from gel…), wrong insert or re-ligation of pdCas9 fragments may occur… so inoculate more colonies and store one of the plates sealed with parafilm in the fridge.
Amplify mutated pdCas9 and pSB1C3:
PCR mix for amplification of pdCas9 and pSB1C3 were prepared by mixing:
pdCas9: 0.5 μL template (PCII, 65.8 ng/ μL), 6 μL FWD GA1 primer, 6 μL REV GA3 primer, 12.5 μL Takara HiFi PCR premix.
This sample was amplified in a PCR machine with an annealing temperature at 55 ℃ for 10 s, and an elongation temperature at 72 ℃ for 7 min.
pSB1C3: 1 μL template (linear pSB1C3, 25 ng/ μL), 6 μL FWD primer, 6 μL REV primer, 12.5 μL Takara HiFi PCR premix.
The sample of pSB1C3 ran in a PCR machine with an annealing temperature at 55 ℃ for 10s, and an elongation temperature 72 ℃ for 2 min.
Nanodrop - mutated dCas9 and backbone:
The concentrations of enzymatically digested pdCas9 and pSB1C3 were too low to be detected (negative values).
Therefore, the mutated pdCas9 and pSB1C3 were amplified via PCR to increase the amount. Further we plan on cutting the PCR product with restriction enzymes over two nights, before separation on gel and isolate the desired fragments. This may increase the concentration of the products after gel digestion. Probably, heat inactivation of the restriction enzymes after gel digestion and DNA isolation may be a good idea (most of the enzymes are separated from the DNA fragments on gel), before the ligation step.

The quantity and quality of the miniprep products were measured using the Nanodrop. The isolated biobricks were then digested by combining:
15 μL sample (appr. 1500 ng, for all three samples)
0.5 μL EcoRI-HF
0.5 μL PstI
2 μL NEB 2.1 buffer
2 μL ddH2O
The restriction mixtures were incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking (225 rpm).

Goal:
Gel purification of overnight digested biobricks
Measure quantity and quality of the purified digested biobricks
Ligation of mutated dCas9 and digested biobricks
Transformation of ligation mixture into competent DH5α cells
Procedure:
Gel purification of overnight digested biobricks
The overnight digested biobricks were heated at 80 °C for 20 min. Loading dye was added and the samples were run on a 0.8% agarose gel containing GelGreen. The bands at approximately 2000 bp was excised from the gel, and the fragments was recovered following the ZymocleanTM Gel DNA Recovery protocol. The quantity and quality of the purified digested biobricks were measured using the Nanodrop.
Ligation of mutated dCas9 and digested biobricks
The mutated dCas9 samples, which were gel purified yesterday, were ligated with the isolated pSB1C3 backbone of the biobricks. Two ligation mixtures was prepared using dCas9 1.1 and the backbone from BBa_K592009 (sample B2) and dCas9 1.2 and the backbone from BBa_K592010 (sample G2):
2 μL T4 DNA ligase buffer
5 μL T4 DNA ligase
16 μL dCas9 1.1 (40.0 ng) | 16 μL dCas9 1.2 (33.6 ng)
1 μL pSB1C3 from BBa_ (40.1 ng) | 1 μL pSB1C3 from BBa_ (32.5 ng)
5 μL ddH2O
The ligation mixtures were incubated at 37 C for 2 hours.
Transformation of ligation mixture
10 μL of each ligation mixture was used in the transformation of competent DH5α cells. Also, 950 μL of LB was added prior to a 1.5 hours incubation period. Otherwise, the transformation was conducted as described in our protocol section.
