  of Natural Sciences.Researchers at NTNU's Department of Biotechnology and Food Science study 
  both basic questions as well as problems with practical applications. One of their main focuses 
  is finding new applications for national marine resources, as exemplified by advanced 
  biotechnological applications of alginate from seaweeds/bacteria, chitin/chitosan from crustaceans 
  and fish gelatine. At the department, they are also working on isolating new marine microorganisms 
  that can produce medicines and other valuable substances, and they employ gene technology and 
  modern analytical methods to understand and optimize processes in bacteria. The department helped 
  us by covering our expenses for rental of the laboratory, and gave us access to various lab 
  equipment and chemicals. For this we are grateful – Thank you so much!
