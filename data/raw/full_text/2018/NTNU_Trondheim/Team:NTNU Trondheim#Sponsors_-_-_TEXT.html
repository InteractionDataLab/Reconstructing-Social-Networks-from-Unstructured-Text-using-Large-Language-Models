Department of Biotechnology and Food Science
The Department of Biotechnology and Food Science is one of eight departments at the Faculty    of Natural Sciences.Researchers at NTNU's Department of Biotechnology and Food Science study    both basic questions as well as problems with practical applications. One of their main focuses    is finding new applications for national marine resources, as exemplified by advanced    biotechnological applications of alginate from seaweeds/bacteria, chitin/chitosan from crustaceans    and fish gelatine. At the department, they are also working on isolating new marine microorganisms    that can produce medicines and other valuable substances, and they employ gene technology and    modern analytical methods to understand and optimize processes in bacteria. The department helped    us by covering our expenses for rental of the laboratory, and gave us access to various lab    equipment and chemicals. For this we are grateful – Thank you so much!

Centre of Digital Life Norway
The Centre for Digital Life Norway is a national centre for biotechnology education, research, and    innovation. It is run as a collaborative project by the University of Oslo, University of Bergen, and the    Norwegian University of Science and Technology, supported by the Norwegian Research Council. The activities    at the centre is organised in a governance and networking project, which includes a graduate school, and    several research projects. The centre facilitates transdisciplinary cooperation across institutions and    fields of research, and between projects. The host institutions of the research projects at the centre    constitute the hub- and node-structure of the network. Thank you for your generous support!

NTNU Biotechnology – The Confluence of Life Sciences, Mathematical Sciences and Engineering
NTNU Biotechnology is one of the three enabling technology programmes at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Together they define the strategic core of NTNU’s long-term R&D commitment within natural science and technology.
The design of NTNU Biotechnology programme reflects the conviction that extensive transdisciplinary interaction between the life sciences, mathematical sciences and engineering is the key to transformative 21st century biotechnology. It is developed in close conjunction with SINTEF, the largest independent research organisation in Scandinavia, and St. Olavs hospital (Trondheim University Hospital), which is tightly integrated with our Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences.
Thank you for your generous support!
