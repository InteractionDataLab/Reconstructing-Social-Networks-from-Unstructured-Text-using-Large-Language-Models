Iâ€™m Carmen. Iâ€™m studying biotechnology and Iâ€™m starting with my fourth year of my integrated masterâ€™s degree. Ever since I was in high school, I was fascinated about how synthetic biology can apply to solve different problems around us. I joined the iGEM-team because I like to get more experiences, work with other team members, get new friends and create beautiful memories together. When Iâ€™m not working with our iGEM-project, I cook with my friends and have a nice chat during the meal. Another thing that I really like is to travel to different countries. Usually, I donâ€™t have any special plans on my sightseeing or to do list. I just enjoy walking around while exploring the beauty of the places, and of course taste the local food</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="home-box"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col s12 m7"><H2><SPAN class="team-color">Amanda (20)</SPAN></H2><P> Amanda is our youngest team member. A youngster. Our little baby if you like. She is here to steal all our knowledge!</P><P> Hello! I am studying Biotechnology and will begin my second year this fall. I applied to join NTNU's iGEM Team 2018 because I love learning and challenging myself. I am really looking forward to see all the exciting projects at the Giant Jamboree in October, and to present our own project! In my spare time I enjoy being outside, running, basketball, cooking and having friends over. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="home-box"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col s12 m7"><H2><SPAN class="team-color">Anja (22)</SPAN></H2><P>Hello! I am doing an integrated master's degree in computer science and will start my third year this fall. Therefore, I am mostly responsible for our wiki, but I occasionally mess up in the lab, too ðŸ˜Š iGEM is a great opportunity to gather research experience and to learn how to cooperate in teams. Other than iGEM, I love most TV-series that begin with the letter G (GoT&amp;GossipGirl), reading, running and lifting heavy objects before putting them down again. So excited to work with our project and to meet you all at the Jamboree this fall!</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="home-box"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col s12 m7"><H2><SPAN class="team-color">Adrian (25)</SPAN></H2><P> Hello! My name is Adrian, born and raised on the far east side in Norway's capital Oslo. My deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) are composed of 50% Croatian and 50% Norwegian genes. I've just finished my bachelor's degree in Biology and will continue with a two year master programme in Biotechnology on NTNU in Trondheim. iGEM seemed like a great opportunity to work as a scientist and solve problems in a team with other scientists to save the world. And yeah, also a great oportunity for making lab-memes (iGEM should also have a special price for the best iGEM related meme, in my opinion). When Iâ€™m not transforming E. coli or isolating plasmid DNA, I like to train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or watch football (European football, the original type).  Looking forward to the Big Jamboree in October!  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="home-box"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col s12 m7"><H2><SPAN class="team-color">Anne (23)</SPAN></H2><P> Hi! This is my forth year studying Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology with specialization in biotechnology.
I decided to apply for the iGEM competition because it seemed like a unique opportunity to get hands-on experience in the lab and with teamwork. Participating in iGEM is also a great way of learning about how to plan and perform projects, through all stages. I believe many of the world's problems will be solved with biotechnology, and it is inspiring to learn about all the new technological innovations.  In my spare time, I like to play handball, hang out with friends and go hiking.  I look forward to seeing all the projects and teams in Boston! </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="home-box"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col s12 m7"><H2><SPAN class="team-color">Hanna (22)</SPAN></H2><P> Hey! I am beginning my fourth year studying Biotechnology at NTNU this autumn. I chose Biotechnology as main profile after 2 years of studying Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology. I applied for the NTNU iGEM-team because it is a great opportunity to explore science both theoretically and in the laboratory.  I am amazed by the possibilities biotechnology provides, and I am eager to learn more and be a part of this. In my spare time, I enjoy going on long walks/runs with my dog while listening to podcasts. It is also fun to go to concerts and cafÃ©s with my friends when the student budget allows it. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="home-box"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col s12 m7"><H2><SPAN class="team-color">Hege (22)</SPAN></H2><P>Hey!

I am studying for a Masterâ€™s Degree in Biotechnology, and have just finished my third year. I love biotech with my whole brain, which is the main reason why I applied to iGEM. I truly believe that Synthetic Biology will offer solutions to many global problems, and therefore I want to learn more about it and be a part of itâ€™s rapid development. iGEM is also a great opportunity to gain lab experience, team work skills as well as input to my continuous pursuit of knowledge and scientific puzzles. Apart from studying and doing iGEM-related activities, I also enjoy hiking, reading, listening to music and constructing arts and crafts.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="home-box"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col s12 m7"><H2><SPAN class="team-color">Paulius (22)</SPAN></H2><P>Hi, I'm Paulius and I've been studying biotechnology for the past three years.
