Making supercompetent E.coli cells
Duration of the protocol: Two days
Make a culture of E.coli in a flask with 10mL Psi-medium.  Inoculate at the end of the day, and incubate overnight at 37oC with shaking.
Transfer 0.5mL of the culture to a new shaking flask with 100mL Psi-medium. Grow in an incubator with vigorous shaking at 37oC until A600 reaches 0.4-0.5.
Place the culture, TFB1 and TFB2 on ice for 5-10 minutes (buffers and pipets is preferred to be cold for the entire protocol).
Transfer cells to 50mL sterile chilled polypropylene centrifuge tubes (10 mL in each falcon tube). It is important with clean tubes.
Pellet cells at 4oC and 5.000 x g for 5 minutes. Throw the supernatant away carefully (possibility for a break if the cells stay on ice)
Do this step on ice. Gently resuspend the pellet in 0.4 volume of TFB1 (20 mL if the total is 50mL in a falcon tube). Leave it for 15 minutes on ice.
Pellet cells for 10 minutes at 2.000 x g and 4oC. Pour off supernatant carefully.
Do this step on ice. Resuspend the pellet in 0.02 volume of TFB2 (carefully).
Mark as many 2mL cryo tubes as you will need with strain name and the date.
Add 50uL of the resuspended cells into the cryo tubes, and leave them on ice.
Flash freeze for 5-10 seconds in liquid nitrogen and store at -80oC.
Colonypicking to liquid medium
After incubation (agar plates) overnight:
Select a single colony. Use an inoculation loop. The loop is sterilized with flame before and after use.
Smudge some of the colony with the loop, and transfer the bacteria to a liquid medium.
Miniprep
Plasmid isolation (Miniprep) was performed following the protocol for the ZR Plasmid MiniprepTM - Classic Kit with slight modification:
Transfer 1mL of each cell culture to an eppendorf tube and centrifuge for 20s at 16000g. Discharge the supernatant.
Add 200μL resuspension buffer (P1 buffer) to the tube and resuspend the cell pellet by pipetting.
Add 200μL lysing buffer (P2 buffer) and mix gently by inverting the tube 4 times. Incubate at room temperature for 2min.
Add 400μL neutralization buffer (P3 buffer) and mix carefully until the solution changes colour from pink to yellow. Centrifuge for 2min at 16000g.
Place a spin column (Zymo-SpinTM IIN column) in a collection tube and transfer the supernatant from step 4 into the spin column.
Centrifuge for 30s at 16000g. Discharge flow-through.
Add 200μL Endo-wash buffer to the column and centrifuge for 1min at 16000g.
Add 400μL Plasmid-wash buffer to the column and centrifuge for 1 min at 16000g.
Transfer the spin column into a clean eppendorf tube. Add 30μL of deionized water directly into the matrix of the column. Incubate for 1min at room temperature.
Elute the plasmids in the spin column by centrifuging for 30s in 16000g.
Gel electrophoresis
For 1% agarose gel:
GelRed or GelGreen (standard 0.8% or 0.4% if separation of smaller fragments)
TAE or LAB buffer
Preparation of the gel:
Pour the GelRed/GelGreen-solution into the gel mould (0.5cm) and let the gel set for 30 minutes.
Move the set gel to an electrophoresis chamber. Based on what buffer is used in the GelRed/GelGreen-solution, choose that one for the covering of the gel. Cover the chamber and gel with the chosen buffer.
Restriction digest:
DNA (10μL), 10xbuffer (2μL), distilled water (7,5μL) and the restriction enzyme (0,5μL) were mixed in a test tube.
The samples were incubated for 1h at 37℃.
Loading dye (4μL) were added to each sample
A solution of DNA ladder (1kb) was prepared by mixing distilled water (8μL), Gene Ruler (2μL) and loading dye (2μL). Note: 250ng DNA are required per 0.5μL enzymes.
DNA ladder (5μL), and the samples with the inserted plasmids (20μL) were added to the wells in the agar gel.
Run the gel:
Run the gel at 90V for approximately 30 minutes, and check the migration of fragments.
Gel purification
The purification of DNA was performed following the protocol for the ZymocleanTM Gel DNA Recovery Kit:
Add 3 volumes of ADB buffer to each volume of agarose excised from gel.
Incubate the sample for 5-10min at 50℃.
Transfer the melted sample to a Zymo-spinTM column assembled into a collection tube. Centrifuge for 60s at 16000g. Discard the flow-through.
Add 200μL DNA Wash Buffer and centrifuge for 30s at 16000g.
Repeat step 4.
Discard the flow-though collected in the collection tube.
Add 20μL deionized water directly onto the matrix of the spin column. Centrifuge for 60s at 16000g.
Assemble the spin column into a clean eppendorf tube and transfer the flow-through from the previous step back into the column matrix. Centrifuge for 60s at 16000g.
