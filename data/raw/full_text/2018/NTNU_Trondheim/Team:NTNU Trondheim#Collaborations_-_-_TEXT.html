Collaboration with the Marburg team
IGEM Marburg asked us if we would like to participate in their collaboration project, which is an Interlab Study of their own design. They wanted us to measure the growth rate of the marine bacterium Vibrio natriegens, by growing it in a liquid LB V2 medium and check the OD600 value every 10 minutes over a period of 5 hours. The measurements were done using spectrophotometry and we made a growth curve of V. natriegens for Marburg.
V. natriegens is a fast-growing bacterium, with a generation time around 8-10 minutes. As of today, E. coli is the commonly used laboratory bacterium, however this bacteriaâ€™s generation time is around 20 minutes. V. natriegens could potentially be a substituent as a laboratory model organism, due to their shorter generation time.
The goal of this collaboration is to investigate if the growth rate of V. natriegens is consistent between all the iGEM teams that are participating in Marburgs Interlab study. We did the growth experiment two times and obtained the growth curves illustrated in Figure 1 and 2.

Collaboration with the Tec de Monterrey Campus Guadalajara
The Tec de Monterrey invited us to join their instagram challenge. The task was to make a sign that says how far away we were from the Giant Jamboree in Boston and the next phrase #ScienceEverywhere. We thought this was a fun, and creative idea, and joined in! Below you can see our photo:
