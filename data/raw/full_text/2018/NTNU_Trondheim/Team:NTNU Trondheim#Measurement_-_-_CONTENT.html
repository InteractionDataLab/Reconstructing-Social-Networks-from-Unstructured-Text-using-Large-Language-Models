We tested and evaluated <I>E. coli’s</I> biofilm formation in 18 different LB and M63B1 media, with different pH and glucose levels. We also tested a broad range of incubation time points for our bacteria and also added adjustments to optimize the conditions. All our observations were thoroughly evaluated and implemented in our well-designed model for the acquired data and observations.</P><P>
As an extra feature, we implemented two sets of negative controls for our CRISPRi system. We grew DH5α and TG1 without the inducer for expression of the CRISPRi system as a negative control. In addition, we considered DH5α as an extra negative control, due to its low biofilm formation in the first place.
</P><H2 class="lab-color">Testing of biofilm promoting mediums </H2><P>
At the beginning of the project, we found a protocol for measuring biofilm formation [1]. Then we had a meeting with Kåre Bergh, who pointed out weaknesses with the current protocol and showed a protocol he had used on a different kind of bacteria [2]. Later we talked to Sven Even Burgos, who also talked to his colleague Anne Tøndervik. They advised us to look at an article [3] that discussed different kinds of methods for quantification of biofilm formation.
We had been informed by Kåre Bergh and Sven Even Borgos (see <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:NTNU_Trondheim/Human_Practices"> Human Practices </A> for more information about these interviews) that the bacteria’s ability to form biofilms is highly dependent on their growth conditions, and that they are especially sensitive to glucose concentrations and pH levels. We wanted to test our CRISPRi system in a medium that promotes biofilm formation because it would make it easier to see a noticeable effect if the system works as expected. </P><P>
In order to investigate which medium gives the highest degree of biofilm formation, we made nine variants of LB and M63B1 medium varying in pH levels (4.5, 7.2 and 9.2) and glucose concentrations (0%, 0.4%, and 0.8%). <I>E. coli</I> TG1 cells were inoculated in each medium and incubated. Table 1 shows the measured OD values for the overnight TG1 cultures. We observed a higher planktonic growth in LB than in M63B1. This is consistent with the fact that M63B1 is a minimal medium with a limited amount of nutrition, mimicking natural conditions [4]. LB, on the other hand, is a nutrition rich medium which provides good conditions for rapid and numerous growth [4]. Generally, the highest growth in both LB and M63B1 were observed in mediums with a pH level of 7.2 supplemented with glucose, either 0.4%, and 0.8%, with only slight differences between the two.</P><TABLE class="tg"><CAPTION><B>Table 1:</B> Measured OD600 values in overnight E. coli TG1 cell cultures grown in LB and M63B1 mediums with different pH levels (4.5, 7.2 and 9.2) and supplemented with different glucose concentrations (0%, 0.4% and 0.8%).</CAPTION><TBODY><TR><TH class="tg-0lax">pH, glucose</TH><TH class="tg-baqh" colspan="2">	OD600</TH></TR><TR><TD class="tg-0lax">LB	</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">M63B1</TD></TR><TR><TD class="tg-0lax">4.5, 0%</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">	1.790	</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">0</TD></TR><TR><TD class="tg-0lax">4.5, 0.4%</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">	0.023	</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">0.002</TD></TR><TR><TD class="tg-0lax">4.5, 0.8%</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">	0.600	</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">0.001</TD></TR><TR><TD class="tg-0lax">7.2, 0%</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">	1.697	</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">0.002</TD></TR><TR><TD class="tg-0lax">7.2, 0.4%</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">	1.200	</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">0.201</TD></TR><TR><TD class="tg-0lax">7.2, 0.8%</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">	1.255	</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">0.228</TD></TR><TR><TD class="tg-0lax">9.2, 0%</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">0.006</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">0</TD></TR><TR><TD class="tg-0lax">9.2, 0.4%</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">	0.005	</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">0.002</TD></TR><TR><TD class="tg-0lax">9.2, 0.8%</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">	1.366</TD><TD class="tg-0lax">0.002</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>
To measure the biofilm formation capabilities of the TG1 cells in the different mediums, we plated each culture on microtiter plates and incubated them for 24 hours. The amount of biofilm adhered to the walls of the wells was then measured by a Crystal Violet Assay. Even though M63B1 gave a low degree of planktonic growth compared to LB (see Table 1), the M63B1 seemed to have a strong biofilm promoting effect in mediums with pH 7.2 and glucose concentrations of 0.4% and 0.8%. The biofilm formation in LB followed the same trend as the planktonic growth. We concluded that the best biofilm conditions were in M63B1 with a pH level of 7.2 and a glucose concentration of either 0.4% or 0.8%. For comparison purposes, we also decided to do measurements in LB medium having the equivalent pH level and glucose concentrations as the optimal biofilm promoting M63B1 mediums. </P><H2 class="lab-color"> Improving the Crystal Violet Assay for quantitative biofilm measurements </H2><P>
The next step was to test if we were able to reduce biofilm formation in bacteria using our CRISPRi system targeting the luxS gene in <I>E. coli</I>. We inoculated the chosen LB and M63B1 (pH 7.2 and glucose concentrations of 0.4% and 0.8%) with DH5α and TG1 cells transformed with pdCas9 and pgRNA with the anti-luxS sequence. After an overnight incubation, the cultures were diluted and plated on microtiter plates. Tetracycline was added to the mediums of our test groups since it is the inducer for the transcription of dCas9. Our control groups lacked this addition. </P><P>
During the first run, we observed that there was some variation between replicates. We therefore decided to run it several times to perfect the protocol to measure biofilm formation using Crystal Violet. In total, we ran the experiment several times before we were satisfied. For each run, we did some slight changes to the protocol:</P><P>Biofilm measurements with Crystal Violet after only 24 hours of incubation:
