Each cell cultures (successful transformed competent cells from day 5 – 26.06.2018) (2.5 mL) were transferred into fresh LB-medium (22.5 mL) with CM (22.5 μL). The new cultures were incubated for about 2 hours at 37℃ with shaking .

The cell density of the new cultures was measured at OD 600, after calibration with water (blank sample).
<U>Plasmid isolation and determination of concentration:</U>

The plasmids were isolated from the competent cell after the protocol of ZR plasmid miniprep kit (see lab journal from day 3 - 22. June. 2018).


The concentration of the plasmids was determined by using Nanodrop.
<U>Restriction digest:</U>

The plasmids from each culture (5 μL) were digested by mixing with 10xbuffer (2 μL), distilled water (12.5 μL) and restriction enzyme BspHI (0.5 μL). The solution was centrifuged down before the samples were incubated over night at 37℃.

<B>Results:</B><U>Plasmid verification:</U>
L, pR1, pR2, pC1 and pC2 are the DNA-fragments from ladder solution, the two samples of pgRNA and pdCas9, respectively. From <B>Figure 1</B> the two fragments with 1.5 kb and 1.0 kb were found from the fragments of pgRNA after digestion by BspHI. The fragment with 100 bp from the digested pgRNA is not visible on the gel, probably due to masking of the dye colour at the bottom of the gel. Two bands from the digested pdCas9 with 2.7 kb and 4 kb were also detected. By comparing the results og gel elecrophoresis obtained from today's experiment with the results from day 3 (22. June. 2018), one can clearly see that the bands with the expected length from successful transformed competent cells, are much clearer. Hence, this also indicate the samples from the successful transformed DH5α cells are purer, which is also true by comparing the results from Nanodrop (see day 6 - 27. June. 2018, and day 3 - 22. June. 2018).

The leaner DNA obtained from PCR (from day 8 – 29.

The sample and the ladder were prepared by the gel electrophoresis protocol.

The concentration and the purity of the isolated DNA was determined by using Nanodrop.

Note! Due to UV-light exposure, the DNA may mutate. In this case, this may affect the later steps of our project. The worse scenario, mutation of anti-luxS. Hence our CSRPRi system may not recognize luxS in the bacteria. Biofilm production will not be inhibited…

From the 260/230 ratio, the sample has a relatively a small amount of nucleic acids. Probably, it is contaminated by the agarose from the gel electrophoresis. On the other hand, the 260/280 ratio is ok, indicating that the sample contains a relatively larger amount of RNA than DNA.

No visible cell colonies were formed on the agar plates that were incubated on day 9 - 02. Junly. 2018. Only the positive and negative control cells formed colonies.

Therefore, the remaining plasmids (6 μL) were transformed to the competent cells and plated on agar based on the same protocol from day 2. Jul. 2018. During the incubation at 37℃ with shaker, the incubation time was extended to 2 h. The cell cultures were centrifuged, and 700 μL supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were resuspended with the remaining supernatant. The cell cultures were then plated on agar plated with CM, and incubated overnight at 37℃.
<U>Inoculation of successful transformed competent cells:</U>
Colonies of successful transformed competent cells with pgRNA (probably containing anti-luxS) were inoculated from the agar plates (from day 9 – 02. July. 2018) to LB-medium with AMP. The cell cultures were incubated with shaker overnight at 37℃.

<U>Cell density:</U>
The cell cultures with pgRNA(2) (probably with anti-luxS), inoculated from day 10 – 04. July. 2018, were diluted 10 times by following the same dilution procedure from day 6 – 27. June. 2018. The cells were incubated with shaker for 1h before measuring at OD 600.
<U>Plasmid isolation:</U>
The plasmids from the two cell cultures were isolated after the same mini-prep protocol from day 3 – 22. June. 2018. The concentration and the purity of the isolated plasmids were measured by Nanodrop.
<U>Restriction digest and gel elecrophoresis:</U>
Insertion of anti-luxS gene was verified after the protocol of restriction digest and gel electrophoresis (see the protocols from day 3 – 22. June. 2018). The restriction enzyme PstI was chosen, and the expected length of the plasmid fragments are 490 bp and 2094 bp.

Note! PstI has a cut site at the anti-luxS gene in the plasmid.

Both pdCas9(2) and pgRNA(2) with anti-luxS (isolated from day 11 – 05. July. 2018) were simultaneously transformed into competent cells (DH5α). The amount of added pdCas9(2) (5 μL) and pgRNA(2) with anti-luxS was 5 µL per/plasmid, and it was added to the same tube containing competent cells. The cells were plated on agar with both AMP and CM. A couple of steps were added at the end, and the purpose was to increase the cell concentration plated on agar, and probably increase the possibility of colony formation. The cell culture was therefore centrifuged for 3 minutes at 6800g, and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was then resuspended and cells were plated.

1. Colonypicking and exchange to liquid medium
<U>Measurements of the first batch (Tecan):</U>
1. Measured the OD of the blank (LB and CM), and measured the OD of the two cultures.

2. For the next measurements we diluted the cultures by 1:100 in separate tubes.

3. Incubation of the tubes 

4. The first measurement was done in the Tecan, and repeated for every 30 minutes and then 1 hour (because of minor changes in values)

5. The measurements was set overnight as well using the following script: FluorescenceLong. The data was set to 588 nm absorbance, 584 nm excitation, 607 nm emission, 37°C, 40 gain, 150 kinetic cycles, 300s shaking (orbital 3 mm amplitude).
<B>Results: </B>
The second batch from transformation has turned red. From the measurements of the test batch we have an idea of the increase in fluorescence intensity and the change in absorbance over time. This can be used to determine the timing of the second batch with the negative control as well.

The biobrick Bba_J004450 was very bright. We used excitation 561 nm and emission ca 625-680 nm as the biobrick was too bright at emission 607 nm. Consider using another laser further away from excitation point (584 nm) for the real photos of the biobrick, and the improved biobrick.

Wells with only medium, not cells, showed too high absorbance measurements, probably because of contamination of the mediums. Decided to autoclave all the mediums again.  Will take measurements at 48 hrs, but not at 72 hrs.
