One of the biggest problems in synthetic biology is that there is a big variability in the results you get from different labs. The goal of the interlab study is to minimize this variability, so that the measurements are both reliable and repeatable for labs all over the world. This year’s interlab study focus on the question: Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD? To answer this question two approaches were used [1]:
<OL><LI>Converting between absorbance of cells to absorbance of a known concentration of beads.</LI><LI>Counting colony forming units from the sample.</LI></OL></P><H2 class="color: interlabs-color">Calibration</H2><P>There were made three sets of calibration measurements: OD600 reference point, particle standard curve and fluorescein standard curve. </P><P>The first calibration measurement was to get a conversion factor so that we could easily convert absorbance (Abs600) to OD600. Here we used the LUDOX CL-X. 
The results were:

For the particle standard curve, a dilutions series of monodisperse silica microspheres was prepared and the absorbance was measured in a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro plate reader. This curve was used to convert absorbance to number of cells. Figure 1 shows the linear particle standard curve, and a mathematical relationship between absorbance and number of particles was estimated: 
 y = 3*10<SUP>-9</SUP>x + 0.0401 
with a value of  R² = 0.9995. A particle standard curve in log scale was also plotted as shown in Figure 2.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 1:</B> Particle standard curve.

A dilution series for the fluorescein standard curve was also made.

The day after, two colonies from each plate were inoculated in LB-medium + Chloramphenicol. The cells grew overnight. OD600 was measured and the cultures were diluted to a target OD600 of 0.02 in a final volume of 12 mL.

The second approach of this interlab study was to find colony forming units (CFUs) per 0.1 OD600 E. Coli cultures. Starting samples were prepared from the positive and negative control by diluting the overnight culture 20 times until OD=0.1 for the cell culture minus the blank measurement. Dilution series was prepared and 36 plates were aseptically spread with dilution series 3, 4 and 5. </P><P>Given that the cultures were diluted to target OD<SUB>600</SUB> = 0,1. The Abs<SUB>600</SUB> = 0,0678 (including blank) was obtained by using the factor OD<SUB>600</SUB>/ Abs<SUB>600</SUB> = 3,338 to convert OD<SUB>600</SUB> to Abs<SUB>600</SUB>. According to the standard particle curve, the predicted number of cells will be 0,93*107. By comparing the values of CFU/mL from Table 5 with the predicted number of cells (0,93*107), these values have a relatively large variance, and a large deviance from the predicted number of cells.</P><TABLE><CAPTION><B>Table 3:</B> Dilution factors for dilution series 3, 4 and 5.
