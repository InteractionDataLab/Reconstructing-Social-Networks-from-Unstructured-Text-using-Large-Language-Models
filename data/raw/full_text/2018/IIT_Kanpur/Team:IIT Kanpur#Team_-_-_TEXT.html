Our Team
Abhinav Soni
Abhinav is a Bachelors and Masters student in Biological Sciences and Bioengineering at IIT Kanpur. Mentored the project, right from the unrealistic brainstorming sessions to consolidate wiki freeze. Apart from the project, Abhinav is working on his thesis on developmental biology. Outside iGEM, Abhinav likes to sleep. He has been an inspiration to the team lingo.
Anunay Jain
Anunay is a final year undergraduate in Biological Sciences and Bioengineering at IIT Kanpur. All our protein production has been done under him. *interest* Anunay gets fascinated by anything and everything. Anunay will offer all you need to know about Czech. Do catch up with him at the Jamboree.
Anushya Goenka
Anushya is a final year undergraduate in Biological Sciences and Bioengineering at IIT Kanpur. She is highly interested in Computational Logic and Machine Learning techniques :P Loves beer and travels like it is her religion.
Koushani Das
Koushani is a final year undergraduate in Biological Sciences and Bioengineering at IIT Kanpur. During brainstorming sessions, her eyes would twinkle with ideas, one time on bacterial perfumes! Our project was shooted up from her idea on biodegrading SDS. Outside of the lab, Koushani is interested in psychology, loves music, the idea of sports but not sports xD! And science fiction novels. She enjoys traveling and making friends with girls.
Adarsh Kumar
Adarsh is a third year undergraduate of Mechanical Engineering department at IIT Kanpur. He describes space-time theories in the best ways possible. A dedicated hard worker, his multitasking abilities would leave you wondering if he belongs to another space-time dimension. Despite such brilliance, there needs to be an improvement in his music taste.
Aryaman Jha
Aryaman is a third year undergraduate in Physics department at IIT Kanpur.  His high processing mind requires fourteen hours of sleep. When it comes to drawing anime character, his skills are comparable to the best online tools.
Shivam Kant
Shivam is a third year undergraduate in Biological Sciences and Bioengineering at IIT Kanpur. Five hundred milligrams of Caffeine a day wonâ€™t affect him much. He likes going on casual walks and taking pictures of interesting stuff.
Rishabh Jain
Rishabh is a second year undergraduate in Biological Science and Bioengineering at IIT Kanpur. Junior most member, he belongs to a special batch. A truly dedicated person, he never hesitates from the task assigned to him. Potential team leader of future iGEM teams. He has his hands everywhere from Photoshop, web design to wet lab experiments. He loves to write and overthink.
