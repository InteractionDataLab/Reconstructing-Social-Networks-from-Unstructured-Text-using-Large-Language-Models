Our Idea
Our aim is to extract 1-dodecanol(C12H26O) via in vitro degradation of Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS) from contaminated water. This would be done in Escherichia coli(E.coli) BL21(DE3) strain using alkyl sulfatase protein (SdsA1) derived from Pseudomonas sp. ATCC 19151 where it is has been shown to be responsible for degrading SDS into 1-dodecanol.
We plan to achieve this in three steps:
● Extracellular release of SdsA1 by E.coli BL21(DE3) via attachment of N-terminal secretion signal sequence pelB or OmpT.
● This is followed by the action of alkyl sulfatase(SdsA1) on SDS resulting in the production of 1-dodecanol within the water sample.
● Separation and purification of 1-dodecanol from the sample.
