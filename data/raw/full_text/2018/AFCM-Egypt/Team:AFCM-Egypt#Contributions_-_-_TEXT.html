Contributions to IGEM Community
We believe we did contribute to IGEM community by providing a specific design and part collection of lentiviral delivery that could be used to boost therapeutic delivery of regulatory DNA and enrich synthetic biology research on Non Coding RNAs. We also provided an integrated approach of bioinformatics, metagenomics and machine learning to improve our idea and facilitate development of such integrative SynBio projects in the future for IGEM teams as well as Egyptian undergraduate research teams. Finally, we provided simple SynBio tutorials, lectures and demos for Egyptian high school students, undergraduates and Professors in various fields about IGEM and synthetic biology in general, so we hope to be good representatives and ambassadors for IGEM in Our Beloved Egypt.
 
Parts Contributions
Silver; We have submitted 18 new BioBricks to IGEM registry with selection of 3 for judging validation. All parts have been designed for the purpose of providing an experimental framework of delivering miRNAs through lentiviral transfection. All parts have been provided with experimental characterization on their registry pages, with RFC 10 compatibility assured during designing and synthesis process.
Part:BBa_K2534003
miRNA 134 5p
has been submitted as miRNA-134 5p which was discovered to function as tumor suppressors in colorectal cancer by independently suppressing EGFR and PI3K signaling.  We have worked to do lentiviral transfection of that part into colorectal cancer cell line RKO to induce regulatory apoptosis as well as to investigate its immune modulatory effect on TLR-9
Part:BBa_K2534015
SV40 Promoter
We have provided The SV40 (Simian Virus 40) promoter contains the SV40 enhancer promoter region and origin of replication in Part:BBa_K2534015 for high-level expression and replication in cell lines expressing the large T antigen (e.g. COS-7 and 293T cells). They will not replicate episomally in the absence of the SV40 large T antigen. The SV40 promoter is weak in B cells, but SV40 exhibits high activity in T24 and HCV29 human bladder urethelium carcinoma cell lines.
BBa_K2534022
TetR
We have created Part:BBa_K2534022 as an efficient switching control system for lentiviral delivery of miRNAs into Colorectal cancer cell line RKO. We also worked to improve this part by adding a universal terminator to improve the control of the highly specific interaction of the tet repressor protein (TetR) with (tetO). TetR binding on tetO classically stops expression of genes downstream of tetO by excluding RNA polymerase from binding the promoter and initiating transcription.
Characterization of Registry Parts; Bronze
We have provided specific characterization for Part:BBa_I714891 by using eGFP for experimental characterization of lentiviral transfer plasmid transfection efficacy and apoptotic effect on colorectal cancer cell line RKO.
We have added new experimental characterization to a variety of already existing IGEM Registry parts with provision of clear documentation at each part’s page on the registry.
We have provided specific characterization for Part:BBa_K2217024 through gel electrophoresis for experimental characterization of lentiviral transfer plasmid transfection efficacy as a strong promoter enhanced by fusing CMV enhancer.
We have provided specific characterization for Part:BBa_K2041000 through gel electrophoresis for experimental characterization of lentiviral transfer plasmid transfection efficacy as efficient switching system to control the transfection experiment for the transfer plasmid.
