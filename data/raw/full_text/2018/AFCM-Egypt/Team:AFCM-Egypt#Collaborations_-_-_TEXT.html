Video Conference (Bordeaux)
This year we received an invitation from IGEM Bordeaux to participate in a scientific event about synthetic biology.
Our role in this event was to give a lecture via skype about our experience with synthetic biology and the advantages and disadvantages of synthetic biology throughout our participation in IGEM.
 
 
 
 
Postcards (dusseldorf)
Team Dusseldorf suggested an artistic collaboration which was sharing postcards with other teams.
So, we decided to participate with a pharaohnic design so the world can see the beauty of the old Egyptian arts.
Comic books (ouc–China)
Team ouc –china made a wonderful comic book about synthetic biology
that deserved to be translated into Arabic language and to be shared with our collegues.
Video (iGEM TEC CEM 2018)
Instead of shooting our own video for the jamboree
we found it easier to take part in team IGEM TEC CEM 2018’s collaboration to shoot a part of a song in our lab and integrate the videos of the collaborating teams to make a universal clip for the songs they chose.
Surveys
As usual, our team seeks to take part in every survey available on the collaboration page.
All members of the team have to answer the surveys on the collaboration page despite of its not considered as a collaboration but we see that our answers may help other teams in their statistics.
