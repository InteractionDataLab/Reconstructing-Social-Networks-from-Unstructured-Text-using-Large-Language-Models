Sir J. A. Muir Gray
Meeting sir M. Gray during his visit to Egypt was such an honor. he influenced us from his flood of knowledge..
He made it clear to us that in order to get the succeed at finding a well established screening programme or any trial for therapy, lies in the idea of being well organized.
He stressed out that working in a systematic approach can lead you to find the answers or solutions for any problem. He liked the idea of our project and encouraged us to carry on our work.
 
 
 
 
Dr Ahmed El-Awady
PCommended us on our choice of idea and stressed that the acting of miRNA as TLR ligands is an interesting area of research.
He also pointed out that miRNA-TLR ligands may aid in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which some evidence has proven its contribution to carcinogenesis.
Prof. Sir Magdy Yacoub
We invited dr Magdy Yacoub (Professor of Cardiothoracic surgery and Imperial College of London) to discuss our topic and the importance of the miRNA as a modulator of the immune response.
He was fascinated by the idea yet he stressed out to be focused on what we need and we actually implement. “The immune system is not something to be tampered with.” He clarified.
Dr Tarek Tawfik
We sat with Prof. Tarek Tawfik (Former Deputy Minister of Health) to explain our project idea and why we thought it was relevant. We went over the specificities of our project especially mentioning our idea in using lentivirial vectors in therapy.
Safety, an issue we faced while speaking to him, because generally many safety concerns surround the use of lentiviral vectors. We explained that it wasn’t feasible for us to use such vector because its lab safety is no.3 or no.4 and Igem only let us use bio lab safety no.1 or no.2.
Prof Hany Hafez Lotfy
, we held several closed discussion with Prof Hany concerning the most efficient ways of implementing the new radiological technological advances in the early detection of cancer. He took our team to seminars where we deliberated, back and forth, about our iGEM 2018 hypothesis for the early detection of colon cancer along renowned scholars of his field.
Prof Sherif Sedky
Dr Sherif showed us his supreme generosity by permitting us to train in Zweil city, one of the biggest mansions of science in Egypt.
Besides him givinng us this opportunity, he guided us through many obstacles that we faced during the wet lab part. He himself supervised some of the steps that we did during the project.
