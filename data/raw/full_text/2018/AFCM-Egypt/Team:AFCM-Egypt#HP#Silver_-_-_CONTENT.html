Also, how to work as a team with their colleagues and teachers. We advised them to join iGEM next year and we're pretty sure they're going to accomplish something.</P><DIV class="img-cont"><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="modal modal-2"><DIV class="modal-content"><H1>PIS</H1><H5>Port-said international schools is a sample representing the schools of Egypt.

Also, we arranged a small magic show for the little kids at the school under the title of &quot;playing with science&quot;. Even though the sessions may seem simple. Yet, they had a great effect on the souls and minds of these young lads. </P><P>At the end of the day, we gave them a presentation about our new idea and what we strive to achieve at this year's competition. They were excited to search for the new things we taught them that day and even more excited to hear about what we're going to do in iGEM 2018. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="modal modal-3"><DIV class="modal-content"><H1>MIU</H1><H5>Involving college students of the future especially pharmacists in what we do, is one of the things we hope to accomplish.

Unfortunately, not everyone knows iGEM and not everyone is interested in synthetic biology but this is not because they don't like synthetic biology. But, it's because they don't know what synthetic biology is. So we spoke to them about it, bioinformatics and of course the iGEM competition. It was a fruitful day and we think we can see the results of what we did this day in their enthusiasm to learn about synthetic biology.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="modal modal-4"><DIV class="modal-content"><H1>Lab Training</H1><H5>Through our journey in the human practices part, we held many events at different schools.

Sad enough we had to only pick a few of them to be involved in our journey. </P><P>They were really happy but we were even happier to teach them and guide them through the lab work, human practices and mostly the team's fun day. We learned a lot from them as well. They helped us in organizing other human practices events at their communities.

The day AFCM visited my school was one of my luckiest days ever. I got to join them as an observer of what they do in the great iGEM competition. I loved everything; the lab works, how we work together in a team, the human practices and joking around with the team. &quot;</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="team-member"><DIV class="text-wrap"><H2>Somaya Sherif </H2><P>&quot;Hey there, this is Somaya Sherif. I'm 17 years old and I consider myself so blessed. Having such a great experience in joining the AFCM iGEM team enlightened me with new aspects of science that I didn't know existed. I loved every part of it specially the lab work.

Thus we thought that arranging an event at the international women's day at their hospital is a great idea and was one of the biggest events we held. It gave us the opportunity to meet women representatives of all Egypt. </P><P>We discussed with them what cancer is, gave them a brief about what can cause it and the healthy lifestyle that could save us from it. Because we all know that women are half of the society and they raise up the other half, we felt that it is a must to enlighten them with such information. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
