Mohamed Tarek 
He Participated in development of the microRNAs idea and contributed to the final design of the TLR idea with the notion of structural ligands. He also worked on selection of vector plasmids for lab work, designed the needed parts and participated in characterizing parts in the lab along with part submission protocol. Finally, he supervised the computational biology work, the bioinformatics and network modelling and developed the mathematical and machine learning associated modelling.
 
Badr Mohammed 
He took part in purposing the idea, lab work and the social events of human practice.
 
Mohamed Salah 
Shared in purposing the idea, the wet lab work, helped with the social events of human practice, surveys translation and above all the first team presenter.
 
Mohammed Hussam 
 
He contributed to the conception and design of our circuits through the acquisition and retrieval of data from literature and bioinformatics data banks and shared in modelling and docking of the systems involved in our work using various computer programs and web based servers.
 
Ahmed Muhammed Abdel-Aal
His main role in 2018 IGEM team was to find a broad background about Metagenomics, its applications and its relation with cancer. And his other task was to generate scientific applicable ideas in cancer therapy using metagenomics and Understanding Bioinformatics basis, its application, synthetic biology tools in our research work, sharing in practical work and human practices were mandatory.
