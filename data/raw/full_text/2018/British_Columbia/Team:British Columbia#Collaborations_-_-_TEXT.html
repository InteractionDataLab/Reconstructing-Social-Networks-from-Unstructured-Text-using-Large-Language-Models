ACHIEVEMENTS
University of Nebraska-Lincoln Safety Case
We collaborated with the UNebraska-Lincoln iGEM team to build a Safety Case for our project. This is a method of building rigorous logical arguments about the safety of a project that the UNebraska-Lincoln team has pioneered in iGEM. Given the competition’s focus on biosecurity and safety, building this safety case helped us thoroughly evaluate the current and projected risks of our project.
University of Washington Wiki Tutorial
The University of Washington’s iGEM team helped us learn how to code for our wiki with their tutorial. Many of our team are first time programmers and this was instrumental in helping us get everything ready for the wiki freeze.
