Protocol for cloning promoter-RBS-4CL in pSB1C3
A.      Restriction enzyme digest 1.       Prepare the master mix in a microfuge tube by combining the following: Component Volume to add (ul) 10X NEB Buffer 2.1 6 NEB PstI restriction enzyme 4 Autoclaved distilled water 26 TOTAL 36   2.       Zip-spin the master mix to collect all liquid at the bottom of the tube 3.       With a pipette set to 25 ul, pipette each reaction up and down several times to mix 4.       Vortex the master mix thoroughly 5.       Zip-spin the master mix again 6.       Aliquot the master mix into 3 aliquots of 14 ul (discard the remaining master mix) 7.       Label the three tubes containing the aliquots as follows: a.       P-RBS b.       4CL c.       PDC (positive digest control)
