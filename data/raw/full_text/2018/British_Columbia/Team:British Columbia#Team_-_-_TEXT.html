AHMED ABDELMONEIM
Ahmed is a third-year Combined Honours Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology student. He joined iGEM as a chance for him to work on a multi-disciplinary project that fulfills his diverse and ever growing interests. Outside of iGEM, Ahmed is a huge rock and blues fan, and spends most of his free time jamming out on his guitar, he also loves to go scuba diving whenever he has the chance.
GARVIT BHATT
Garvit Bhatt is a fourth-year undergraduate student in Chemical Biology Combined major. He is excited to create with the iGEM team and pursue scientific advancements in the field of synthetic biology. iGEM has given him the opportunity to gain research experience and build a project from the bottom up. Outside of academic research he enjoys weightlifting, cooking and travelling.
FRANCIS DURNIN-VERMETTE
ALEX GAUDI
Alex is a third year Applied Biology student who first joined iGEM to gain more lab experience in microbiology. Outside of iGEM, he enjoys reading sci-fi.
EVAN GIBBARD
Evan is a 4th year Honours Cell and Developmental Biology student. He joined iGEM to get more experience in synthetic biology, fundraising, and science communication. Outside of research, he is an avid runner and enjoys playing the piano. This is his second year on the iGEM team and he’s consistently inspired by all of the fantastic projects in iGEM.
CHANWOO HO
Chanwoo is a third-year Integrated Science student who joined iGEM to gain experience in life science research. He enjoys making wooden furniture, and plays the guitar as a hobby.
MORRIS HUANG
Morris is a second-year Microbiology and Immunology student. Hearing about iGEM, he jumped in full-heartedly, for a chance to dive into the fascinating world of synthetic biology. Outside of iGEM, Morris is an avid reader and loves to cook.
JANZEN HUI
CHRISTINE KIM
Christine is a third-year Microbiology & Immunology student who has been part of UBC iGEM for the past two years. She first joined iGEM to gain a better understanding of synthetic biology and has learned so much from being part of iGEM! Outside of iGEM, Christine loves to go dog-spotting (it’s a good day when she sees a corgi) and find new places to eat.
LUXCIA KUGATHASAN
Luxcia is a second-year Cell Physiology student. During her time with iGEM she has learned the wonders (and also the trials and tribulations) of creating a project with multiple functional components; all starting with an idea. Outside of iGEM Luxcia loves to do anything outdoors: hiking, camping, kayaking, you name it! During the times she isn't feeling as adventurous, she likes stay at home with a bag of chips and a good book.
KEVIN LAM
Kevin is a third-year Biotechnology student who joined iGEM to learn more about the world of genetic engineering and bioinformatics. In his spare time, Kevin enjoys photography, eating food, jogging along the Fraser River, eating food (yes, twice), and searching up recipes to make but never making them… Kevin aspires to be more involved in bioinformatics and is still constantly looking for new experiences and opportunities.
DANIEL MCCLEMENT
Daniel is a third-year Chemical & Biological Engineering student who joined iGEM to learn more about synthetic biology and microbiology. iGEM has given Daniel the opportunity to gain lab experience he would not have otherwise received in his engineering courses. Daniel Is hoping to pursue a career in biomedical engineering. Outside of iGEM, Daniel enjoys playing hockey and watercolor painting.
CATHERINE PAN
Catherine is a third-year Microbiology & Immunology student, and she has been part of the UBC iGEM team for two years. Through iGEM, she has learned a lot about the fascinating field of genetic engineering, and she is very grateful that UBC iGEM gave her the opportunity to combine two of her interests - science and graphic design, both of which she hopes to pursue in the future. Outside of research and design, Catherine enjoys going on YouTube marathons and performing gymnastics.
ARIEL QI
CATHY YAN
Cathy Yan is a third-year Microbiology & Immunology student who joined iGEM to gain experience in research in the fields of genetic engineering, synthetic biology, and microbiology. Outside of iGEM, she enjoys reading about everything from stem cell research to international crime. She is also an avid podcast enthusiast and foodie.
GRADUATE ADVISORS
ASHLEY ARNOLD
Ashley is a Masters student studying microbial community dynamics in biofuel contaminated soil environments and helped advise the human practices team. Outside of her research, Ashley is passionate about science journalism and community outreach and hopes to become more involved in these fields in the future. This is her second year as an iGEM advisor.
DAVID GOERTSEN
CAMERON HERBERTS
KATERYNA IEVDOKYMENKO
Kateryna is a 4th year PhD student in Microbiology Department and have been mentoring the iGEM team for 4 years now. Kateryna's research focuses on combining environmental genomics with synthetic ecology to build synthetic microbial communities for bioremediation applications. Kateryna mostly helps with a wet lab aspect of the iGEM project.
KEVIN KUCHINSKI
Kevin is a Masters student in Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the BC Centre for Disease Control where he tracks avian influenza in British Columbia's wild birds. As an iGEM advisor, will advise the team as they plan their laboratory work, learn and master techniques in molecular biology, and design experiments to build and test their prototype.
