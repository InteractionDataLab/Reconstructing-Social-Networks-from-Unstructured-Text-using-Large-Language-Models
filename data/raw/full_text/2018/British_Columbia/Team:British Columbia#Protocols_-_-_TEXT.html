E. coli Chemically Competent Cell Preparation
Materials:
LB media
0.1 M CaCl2
0.1 M CaCl2 + 15% glycerol
Liquid N2
Keep these on ice for >30 minutes:
200 mL centrifuge tubes
50 mL Falcon tubes
0.5 mL microfuge tubes
Protocol:
Inoculate 100 mL overnight culture in LB at 30°C.
Transfer 1 mL overnight culture to 100 mL LB (or scale up) and incubate shaking at 30°C for 3-4 hours until OD600 reaches 0.5-0.6.
Chill culture for 10 minutes on ice.
Spin culture for 10-15 minutes at 4000g 4°C.
Remove supernatant and resuspend with 30-40 mL of 0.1 M CaCl2.
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
Spin culture down for 10 minutes at 4000g 4°C.
Remove supernatant and resuspend in 6 mL 0.1 M CaCl2 + 15% glycerol.
Aliquot 50 uL in 0.5 mL microfuge tube and snap-freeze in liquid N2.
