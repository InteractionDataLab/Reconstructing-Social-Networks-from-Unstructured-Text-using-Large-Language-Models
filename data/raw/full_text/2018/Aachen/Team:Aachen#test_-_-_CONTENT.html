				Spectrometers are important tools in every lab and educational facility. Their application is quite diverse. From astronomy where spectral emission lines of distant galaxies are measured to industrial applications like the fine tuning of LCD displays, these devices are needed everywhere.

				When we looked for a spectrometer for our localized plasmon resonance sensing device, we either had the choice of using an expensive commercial 5000$ spectrometer or building one on on our own. We found many diy spectrophotometers but not alot of diy spectrometers. Spectropohotmeters are far easier to built then a spectrometer, since only one specific wavelength is measured. This specificity though, does make them not as versatiale as spectrometers. For alot of applications like LSPR only spectrometers are applicable. So we decided to built one on our own.
				We designed our spectrometer in a way that it can be used for other applications, not just LSPR sensing.
				</P><FIGURE class="floated-m"><FIGCAPTION>
						Figure 1: Our Spectrometer<SUP><A href="#fig1">[5]</A></SUP></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>At first, we reviewed already available spectrometers. We started with looking into publications on cheap spectrometers<SUP><A href="#pubspectro">[1]</A></SUP>. The biggest problem with these is that they do not give actual construction data and are only result orientated. So we concentrated on open source diy designs. The ramanPi spectrometer caught our eye<SUP><A href="#ramanpi">[2]</A></SUP> and we based our design on it. The greatest upside is, that it was developed open source with a detailed construction documentation.
				
				On the other hand, the ramanPi spectrometer project was never finished and validated. Also the design lacks adjustability for the optics that need focussing. This is the most important part of a spectrometer, because every small deviation of the optical components from their optimal position results in a drastic reduction in the spectral resolution.
				To solve this problems, we changed and optimized the original design in the following ways:
				- changed the position of the diffraction grating to put focus on the 600 nm wavelength
				- added adjustable mounts for the slit and CCD Array for focussing
				- changed the setup from a commercial 100$ slit to a 5$ razor blade magnet slit
				- added holder to mount other probes like cuvettes</P><DIV><H3>Layout</H3></DIV><P>The spectrometer is based on the Czerny-Turner configuration (see figure 2). It features a slit, a collimating mirror, a diffraction grating, a focusing mirror and a charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor. The CCD sensor sits on top of a small printed circuit board (PCB), that reduces noise levels and is connected to a Nucleo microcontroller. The Nucleo can then either be connected to a computer or a Rasberry Pi with a small touchscreen for a graphical output. The firmware and the graphical user interface is developed in the open source project TCD1304 by Esben Rossel<SUP><A href="#esben">[3]</A></SUP>.
				The Czerny-Turner setup is also used in commercial products, like the Ocean Optics HR4000. These devices start at around 4000$<SUP><A href="#pricelist">[4]</A></SUP> and house basically the same components as this diy version<SUP><A href="#oceanopticsmanual">[5]</A></SUP>. Companies offer their devices at such a high price, because they have mastered the alignment of these optics. The material cost of these is only a fraction of the price. </P><FIGURE class="floated-m"><FIGCAPTION>

					</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV><H3>Calibration</H3></DIV><P>The output out of the python tool, that you can run on windows or linux, gives out on the x-axis the pixel number and on the y-axis the voltage in mV. If photons hit the CCD sensor the voltage drops. Therefore an increase in intensity leads to a voltage drop in the graph - the signal is inverted (see figure 4).</P><P>
				To get from output in pixel to output in wavelength a third order polynom is used. p is the pixelnumver, S is the wavelength at pixel 0 and Ax are the different polynomial coefficients. A program capable of solving thirdorder linear regression (like Excel) and a light source with at least four peaks is needed. A household fluorescent lamp also used in the chapter on spectral resolution can be used.
				Apart from calibrating the spectrometer, a tuning on the integration time is needed each time a new light source is measured. The integration time sets the time the electronic shutter stays open. If the light source is weak, a longer integration time needs to be set. More information on this can be found on the TCD1304 <A href="https://tcd1304.wordpress.com/timing-requirements/">page</A>.
				</P><H3>Spectral Resolution</H3><P>To benchmark a spectrometer a known spectrum of a light source with close peeks is needed. We used a common commercial fluorescent lamp, as these have distinct emission lines from the flourescent of certain elements. At first we measured the lamps spectrum with a calibrated commercial spectrometer (Ocean Optics HR4000). The measured spectrum can be seen in figure 3. 
				Two distinct spectral lines are marked. 1 is the emission line of terbium Tb3+, 2 of mercury. Terbiums emmision line is at 541.72 nm, mercurys at 545.86. This results in a difference of 4.14 nm. Other sources confirm this value<SUP><A href="#spectrum">[6]</A></SUP>.
				<FIGURE class="floated-m"><FIGCAPTION>
						Figure 3: Spectrum fluorescent lamp - commercial spetrometer
					</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></P><P>
				We then used our diy spectrometer and measured the spectra of the same lamp. The result can be seen in figure 4. The two spectral lines of mercury and terbium Tb3+ can be differentiated. Hence the spectrometer has a spectral resolution of 4.14 nm. The data is more noisy than the commercial spectrometer. This can be explained, due to a couple of factors. Firstly, there is damage on the  collimating  mirror, that was caused during assembly. Seconldy, the slit width is far greater than that of the commercial spectrometer. This increases noise as well. Thirdly, even though the optics are adjustable, they are probably not up to 0.1 mm perfectly aligned.
				Also both peaks in the spectrum taken with our spectrometer have around the same peak, while with the professional spectrometer the peaks have different heigths. This happened because with the professional spectrometer the measurement was taken quite shortly after turning it on. The flourescent lamps spectrum takes some time to reach a stable spectrum and is also dependent on environment variables like temperature.
