S. cerevisiae minimal medium:
Preparation (1000 ml):
mix:
0,67% yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids).
2% cabon source (i.e glucose or raffinose).
0,01% (adenine, arginine, cysteine, leucine, lysine, threonine, tryptophan, uracil).
0,005% (aspartic acid, histidine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, tyrosine, valine).
1,5% agar(for plates).
Dissolve the reagents in 900 ml deionized water (800 ml if preparing medium containing raffinose).
If you are making plates, add the agar after dissolving the reagents above.
Autoclave at 15 psi, 121 ℃ for 20 minutes.
Cool to 50 ℃ and add 100 ml of filter-sterilized 20% glucose or 200 ml of filter-sterilized 10% raffinose.
Pour plates and allow to harden. Invert the plates and store at 4 ℃. Plates are stable for 6 months.
