iGEM is not only about realizing an astonishing project to save the world, but also about learning and helping each other. Every year, new projects     are started, new challenges arise and as students with limited experience in many fields of the iGEM competition,      it is very difficult to always find rapidly the right solution to occurring problems. Hence,     it is required to work together and to share knowledge with other teams.
Our Team, like many others, has gone through     rough times and we want to appreciate  every team that helped us going through all kinds of adversities. In return,     we were able to support other teams which have been struggling with their project's realization.
But iGEM is not only about the projects themselves. It has evolved to a worldwide community with hundreds of teams taking part in.     Enjoying iGEM with other young people who share similar goals and ideals is also an important part of the     competition.
