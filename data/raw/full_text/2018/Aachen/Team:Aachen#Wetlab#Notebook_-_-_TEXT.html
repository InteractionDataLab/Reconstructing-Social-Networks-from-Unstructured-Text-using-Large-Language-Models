Week 1
05/28
Creation of YPD-Medium:
1000 ml YPD-Medium were created after the protocol Liquid YPD Medium in order to enable production of S. cerevisiae overnight cultures        wich are needed for creation of competent cells and genome isolation.
S. cerevisiae overnight culture
In order to produce competent cells for our project S. cerevisiae BY4742 cells were used for two overnight in YPD-Medium.two different colonies of S.cerevisiae         were used for two different overnight culturein 5 ml YPD medium each. Both inoculated tubes were let grown overnight at 30 °C.
Creation of Yeast dropout medium without leucine
500 ml Yeast dropout medium without leucine were produced after protocol yeast dropout medium . In this case it was necessary to produce medium without leucin         because the fist KO it has to be done has an auxotrophy marker for leucin.
05/29
IDT Primer Resuspension (PAA1 KO)
The first primers for the KO of the yeast gene PAA1 were resuspended in TE-Puffer (Volume = 10 times their nanomoles) to reduce the possibility         that DNAses could damage the storaged DNA.
Creation of Competent Cells (BY4742)
The genetic modification of WT BY4247 S. cerevisiae cells can only be achieved if they has been maden competent. In order achieve this        the zymo research kit for creation of competent cells was used( Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit ).        Overnight cultures has been already prepared on the previous day.
Creation of 1,2 % Agarose Solution
500 ml agarose solution for gel electrophoresis were produced (Protopcol: Gel Electrophoresis solution ).
PCR for KO Fragments (PAA1 KO)
After the primer dilution, it was possible to start a PCR to amplify the needed fragments for the ztransformation. In this case, three were        the amplified fragments: upside homologous arm, downside homologous arm and Leu5 auxotrophie marker. These are needed for the creation of         an integration cassette which can be used for genome integration.
05/30
Gel Electrophoresis for PAA1 fragments production PCR (05/29):
the gele electrophoresis showed only for the upside homologous arm positive results. It was necessary to repeat the PCR for the other fragments.
Purification of ampflified Upside Homologous arm
For the purifcation of the upside homologous arm for the PAA1 KO cassette a PCR clean-up kit was used ( PCR clean up kit .        After the purification the concentration was measured with a nanodrop machine.

New PCR was needed to achieve higher DNA concentration of the fragment for the transformation.
PCR for Upside Homologous Arm, Leu5 Auxotropie Marker and Downside Homologous Arm
A new PCR was needed because the previous one did not worked or showed results wich are not good enough for a transformation in BY4742. A gradient PCR                       was started for the fragments which did not showed any results (downside homologous arm and Leu5 auxotropie marker). For the upside homologous arm        the same annealing temperature was chosen as for the previous PCR (05/29) and as template was used the newly purified upside homologous arm fragment         (05/30).
Gel Electrophoresis for upside homologous arm (05/30) and PCR clean-up
Gel electrophoresis showed good results for the upside homologous arm fragment. Consequently, fragment was purified with a PCR clean-up kit.

Gel Electrophoresis for Leu5 Auxotrophie Marker and Downside Homologous Arm (05/30) and PCR clean-up
Gel electrophoresis showed bad results for every single fragments. Consequently it was necessary to try a new PCR with fresh isolated genome         and a different gradient for the annealing temperature.
Test of competent BY4742 (05/30) with Plasmid p0255 on plates without leucin
Before usege it is necessary to test the created competed cells produced with Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit . To test them,        a trasmformation with the plasmid p0255 was performed ( Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit was also used for the transformation).        Cells were let grown overnight at 30 °C on plates without leucin.

A new PCR was needed because the previous one did not worked or showed results wich are not good enough for a transformation in BY4742. A gradient PCR                       was started for the fragments which did not showed any results (downside homologous arm and Leu5 auxotropie marker). For the upside homologous arm        the same annealing temperature was chosen as for the previous PCR (05/30) and as template was used the newly purified upside homologous arm fragment         (05/30).
Gel Electrophoresis for Leu5 Auxotrophie Marker and Downside Homologous Arm (06/01)
Gel electrophoresis showed good results for both fragments. Consequently, fragment was purified with a PCR clean-up kit.

Creation of LiOAC with 10% SDS
LiOAC with 10% SDS is an important compound for cell transformation and because it was no more avaiable it was necessary to create it again .
Gel Electrophoresis for upside homologous arm (05/30) and PCR clean-up
Gel electrophoresis showed good results for the upside homologous arm fragment. Consequently, fragment was purified with a PCR clean-up kit.
Results: DNA: 50,5 ng/ul       A260/280: 1,98 [-]
Gel Electrophoresis for Leu5 Auxotrophie Marker and Downside Homologous Arm (05/30)
Gel electrophoresis showed bad results for every single fragments. Consequently it was necessary to try a new PCR with fresh isolated genome         and a different gradient for the annealing temperature.
Isolation of S. cerevisiae BY4742 genome:
Genome was isolated to be used as template for the gradient PCR for downside homologous arm and Leu5 auxotrophie marker. Isolation was performed         after "Quick and Dirty" protocol . Four genomes from four different BY4742 colonies were isolated. Final concentratioj was determined         with a nanodrop.

06/04
S. cerevisiae overnight culture
In order to produce competent cells for our project S. cerevisiae BY4742 cells were used for two overnight in YPD-Medium.two different colonies of S.cerevisiae         were used for two different overnight culturein 5 ml YPD medium each. Both inoculated tubes were let grown overnight at 30 °C.
Gel Electrophoresis for Leu5 Auxotrophie Marker and Downside Homologous Arm (06/01)
Gel electrophoresis showed good results for both fragments. Consequently, fragment was purified with a PCR clean-up kit.

Transformation of BY4742 cells with PAA1 KO Cassette
Transformation was performed after chemical transformation of S. cerevisiae protocol . Amplified fragments upside homologous arm,        downside homologous arm and Leu5 auxotrophie marker were used for the transformation. As a positive controll plasmid p0255 was transformed in competent        cells. As a negative control WT S. cerevisiae BY4742 was used. All different transformation approches were plated on plates without leucin and incubated        at 30 °C.
06/05
PCR for Upside Homologous arm and Downside Homologous Arm:
A new PCR was needed because the concentration of the PAA1 KO fragments was nearly enough for a single transformation in BY4742. A gradient PCR                       was started for the fragments which did not showed any results (downside homologous arm and Leu5 auxotropie marker). For the upside homologous arm        the same annealing temperature was chosen as for the previous PCR (05/30) and as template was used the newly purified upside homologous arm fragment         (05/30).
Gel Electrophoresis for  Upside Homologous arm and Downside Homologous Arm(06/02)
Gel electrophoresis showed good results for both fragments. Consequently, fragment was purified with a PCR clean-up kit.
Results: DNA (upside homologous arm): 12,4 ng/ul       A260/280: 2,29 [-]
Results: DNA (downside homologous arm): 22,7 ng/ul       A260/280: 2,26 [-]
Due to low DNA concentration and high number of proteins and impurities, it was necessary to dispose of the purified fragments.
Transformation of BY4742 cells with PAA1 KO Cassette
Transformation was performed after Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit . Amplified fragments upside homologous arm,        downside homologous arm and Leu5 auxotrophie marker were used for the transformation. As a positive controll plasmid p0255 was transformed in competent        cells. As a negative control WT S. cerevisiae BY4742 was used. All different transformation approches were plated on plates without leucin and incubated        at 30 °C.
Creation of 2 M Betaine Stock Solution
Thus, it has been observed that the performed PCR do not lead to high product concentration, it was decided to add betaine to the PCR mastermix         (10% of the total mastermix volume has been shown to have a positive effect on the DNA production). Consequently, 30 ml of 2 M betaine solution         were produced. Betaine was afterward stored at 4 °C.
06/06
Production PCR for Upside Homologous arm and Downside Homologous Arm:
A new PCR was needed because the concentration of the PAA1 KO fragments was not enough for any single transformation in BY4742. A gradient PCR                       was started for the fragments which did not showed any results (downside homologous arm and Leu5 auxotropie marker). For the upside homologous arm        the same annealing temperature was chosen as for the previous PCR (05/30). As template were used the newly purified upside homologous arm fragment         with low concentrartion(05/30) and BY4742 isolated genome (genome 1 06/01) for downside homologous fragment.
Gel Electrophoresis for  Upside Homologous arm and Downside Homologous Arm
Gel electrophoresis showed good results for both fragments. Consequently, fragment was purified with a PCR clean-up kit.
Results(upside homologous arm): DNA: 4,1 ng/ul       A260/280: 1,78 [-]
Results (downside homologous arm): DNA: 93,8 ng/ul       A260/280: 1,53 [-]
Due to low DNA concentration and high number of proteins and impurities, it was necessary to dispose of the upside homologous arm.
Transformation of dH5-alpha E. coli cells
Every used auxotrophie marker is contained in plasmid which we recieved from our laboratory, however it was necessary to produce some backups         in E. coli dh5-alpha, because the recieved quantity of plasmid was barley enough for two PCRs. Consequently, a the recieved plasmid p0257 was         transformed in E. coli. Transformed cell were incubated at 37 °C overnight.
06/07
Overnight cultures with ampicillin LB-Medium for transformed E. coli dh5-alpha cells (06/06):
The transformation of the E. coli cells dh5-alpha was successful. Two colonies were used for an overnight culture in 5 ml LB-medium with ampicillin         each. Overnight cultures will be used for plasmid isolation.
Gradient PCR for the Downside Homologous Arm and gel electrophoresis
A new PCR was needed because new DNA of the downside momologous arm has to be used for a transformation. A gradient PCR        was started. In spite of using betaine and fresh isolated genome, it was not possible to achieve downside homologous arm production.
06/08
Gradient PCR for the Downside Homologous Arm and gel electrophoresis
A new PCR was needed because new DNA of the downside momologous arm has to be used for a transformation. A gradient PCR         was started. With this PCR three different PCR protocols should be tested for the same PAA1 KO fragment (downside homologous arm).
Gel electrophoresis for the gradient PCR to test different PCR protocols:
Only, did one protocols work. The protocol which worked is the one with usage of ten percent betaine in the PCR mastermix and twice as much Enzyme          as forseen in the original PCR protocol. Now, a unique protocol could be establish for further PCRs.         Due to the small used sample volume for the PCR, it was not possible to purified the amplified fragment.
06/07
Overnight cultures with ampicillin LB-Medium for transformed E. coli dh5-alpha cells (06/06):
The transformation of the E. coli cells dh5-alpha was successful. Two colonies were used for an overnight culture in 5 ml LB-medium with ampicillin         each. Overnight cultures will be used for plasmid isolation.( Overnight of E. coli Cells )
Gradient PCR for the Downside Homologous Arm and gel electrophoresis
A new PCR was needed because new DNA of the downside momologous arm has to be used for a transformation. A gradient PCR        was started. In spite of using betaine and fresh isolated genome, it was not possible to achieve downside homologous arm production.
Week 3
06/11
Gradient PCR for the Downside Homologous Arm and gel electrophoresis
two PCRs were carried out with the new establish protocol. Both, were gradient PCR. However, the new protocol was used, both PCR failed.         Probably, failure happend because we had to use a very small amout of  BY4742 genome which was difficult to pipette.
Plasmid isolation of p0257 shuttle vector from E. coli dh5-alpha
Produced overnight E. coli dh5-alpha overnight cultures with p0257 (06/10) were used to extract the plasmid p0257. Extraction            was performed with a purification kit (protocol plasmid clean up ).           Result: DNA:    ng/ul     A260/280:   [-]
06/12
Creation of 100 ng/ml stock solutions for the isolated genome
Isolated genpome was diluited with TE puffer in order to achieve a concentration of 100 ng/ul, wich can be used as a stock          solution for PCR mastermixes. 5 ml of stock solution were prepared. (Genome 1 produced on the 06/01 was used for the diluition)
Gradient PCR for downside homologous arm with different template concentrations:
As it was not possible to produce ampflify any downside homologous arm anymore, it was decided to test different genome concentration         which has always been used as template. It was supposed that genome could reduce the efficiency of the PCR, so it was decided to test different concentrations         of it. Tested were three different concentration: 425 ng/ul, 100 ng/ul and 30 ng/ul.
Gel electrophoresi for PCR to test different template concentrations
Best results could be observed for a template concentration of 100 ng /ul in the PCR mastermix.
touchdown PCR for downside homologous arm:
As it was not possible to produce ampflify any downside homologous arm anymore, it was decided to try a touchdown PCR whose annealing temperature          is changed every cycle, just because it was supposed that also the annealing temperature could be a problem.
Gel electrophoresi for the touchdown PCR:
Gel showed no bands at all. The PCR did not worked. We will try again a production PCR with 1000 ng/ul DNA as a template and a different          gradient for the annealing temperature.
06/13
Creation of YPD-Medium plates and YPD liquid Medium
On this day two plates with modified E. coli cellls from Helsinki has came. They contain DNA modifications which enable the usage of RZR1         transcription and its detection (luciferase was integrated as a reporter). In order to utilise them it was necessary to make backups and          overnight cultures. Consequently, it was necessary to produce fresh solid and liquid YPD-Medium. 500 ml of each were produced.(Protocols: YPD-Liquid-Medium and YPD-Solid-Medium ) In addition, these modified cells contain a plasmid with auxotrophie marker which         we are not to need. As a result, it is necessary to make the cell lose the plasmid. In cónclusion, it was decided to let them grew a few days         in full YPD medium. /
Plating of modified BMA64-a1 S. cerevisiae cells from Helsinki
Recieved S. cerevisiae cells from Helsiki were plated on YPD-medium plates.
IDT Primer Resuspension (PAA1 KO) for Helsinki cells
New primers were recieved for the PAA1 KO because the old ones did not show any goos result and consequently they were rtesuspended in TE buffer to achieve a final concentration in the tubes of 100 ng DNA per ml.         the used resuspension volume was ten times the value of the nanomoles primers contained in the tube
06/14
gradient PCR for downside Homologous Arm with Leu5 Auxotrophoe marker as a positive control
New gradient PCR was started to test the new primers we orderderd from IDT for the amplification of downside homologous arm. As a positive control for         the mastermix, we amplificated within the same PCR the Leu5 Auxotrophoe marker fragment which has already shown good results in many different         PCRs.
Gel electrophoresis for the gradient PCR for downside homologous arm
The gel electrophoresis only showed good results for the positive control (Leu5 Auxotrophoe marker fragment). It probably depends on the gradient or on the          used template concentration.
Preparaion of yeast dropout medium withouth Leucine and Tryptophan
Due to the new recieved cells and the necessity to work in the future with different genes and consequently markers, it was needed to produce new media suitable         for different selectable markers.500 ml yeast dropout medium withouth Leucine and 250 ml yeast dropout medium withouth Tryptophan were produced. (Protocol: yeast dropout medium - Sigma Alderich )

Salmon sperm is normally used as a DNA carrier in chemical transformation of yeast cells. 10 ml salmon sperm were produced         ( Salmon Sperm ), divided in 5 different cryo culture tubes (2 ml each) and stored at - 20 °C.
Results of the PAA1 KO transformation (06/04)
It has been observed some growth on the YPD-medium without leucin which has been used for the transformation of BY42742 S. cerevisiae cells         with the PAA1 KO cassette. This is a positive result, however it genome had to be isolated to check the results of the integration in the cell.         Genome of three different positive colonies was isolated. (Protocol: Quick and Dirty )
06/19
Verification PCR for the transformation of the PAA1 KO cassete in S. cerevisiae
PCR was started with a wide annealing temperature gradient to test the transformation of the PAA1 KO cassette in the BY4742 cells genome(06/18).
Results of the verification PCR (06/10)
Good results has been obtained for one of the analysed colonies. It was possible to see that a band of the expected size has been produced in the PCR          at four different annealing temperatures. It confirms that the integration has occoured at the right place in the genome and the integration cassette          has been completely integrated without deletion or major modification. Oveernight culture in 5 ml YPD-medium without leucine of the positive clone has been done.
06/20
production PCR for downside homologous arm
PCR was started in order to amplify the downside homologous arm fragment. It was not a gradient PCR because it has already been shown once          that it was possible at a certain annealing temnperature to successfully amplify the chosen fragment.(06/06). This time, fresh polymerase and          new primers were used.
Results of the production PCR

06/27
Results of the overnight cultures on selected medium (06/22):
It was expected no growth on medium without tryptophane for the modified BMA64-a1 cells withouth plasmid. It was observed that only colony #6 could not        grow in liquid medium withouth tryptophane. This colony could consequently be used for further experiments.
Genome Isolation of BMA64-a1 cells withouth plasmid
An overnight culture has been already prepared on the previous day. The genome was isolated twice from a liquid overnight culture. (Protocol: Quick and Dirty ).
Result genome 1: DNA: 1000 ng/ul    A260/280: 2,35[-]
Result genome 2: DNA:888,3 ng/ul    A260/280:2,6 [-]
isolated genome could not be used for further experimentations or PCRs because its impurity level was too high. Samples were eliminated.
Transformation of E. coli dh5-alpha with KanMX plasmid
KanMX plasmid was transformed in E. coli dh5-alpha because backups for the chosen plasmid were needed.(Protocol: E. coli         transformation )

Primers were          stored at -20 °C.
PCR for isolation of His Cassette from NHX1 cells
The previous iGEM team of our city also worked with yeast and used the same genetic toools as we are. Consequently, we decided to isolate the genome         of their modified yeast cells to extract via PCR their used auxotrophie markers. In this case, we isolated the NHX1 genome (DNA: 96,4 ng/ul). (protocol: Genome Isolation ) Afterwards, a production PCR was startet to isolate from the NHX1 genome the desired His        marker.

Transformed E. coli dh5-alpha cells with KanMX plasmid has grown on LB plates with kanamycin. An overnight for a positive transformed colony has        has been prepared. Liquid LB medium with Kanamycin was used for the overnight to avoid plasmid loss.
07/04
Gradient PCR for His cassette
Gradient PCR was used to find the right annealing temperature and achieve the highest amplification of the His cassette. As a template the isolated genome        of NHX1 cells was used.
Gel electrophoresis for the gradient PCR for the His cassette
PCR worked. We were able to see bands of the right size at many different annealing temperature. Fragments were stored at -20 °C.
Transformation of competent BMA64-a1 cells with PAA1 KO cassette
PAA1 KO cassette was transformed in BMA64-a1 cells. We do not know if our designed fragments are able to be integrated in the genome of         BMA64-a1 cells due to some diversities in the DNA sequence compared with the genome of BY4742 cells.(protocol: Transformation of Chemical competent        Yeast cells ). Transformed cells were plated on plates with medium withouth leucine and incubated at 30 °C.
07/05

No specific primers has been created for this PCR, instead the same primers were used        which has been used for previous cassette isolation in BY4742 cells. The usage of tw different templates should show us if the primers are the         problem for the isolation of the two different homologous arms or the PCR working condition are not ok.
Results of the production PCR
Nothing could be seen on the Gel. However, we could not use the obtained results for any conclusion because there was something wrong with the         agarose gel.
Second Production PCR for downside Homologous Arm and Downside homologousn Arm of the PAA1 KO cassette
Due to the not utilisable results of the previous PCR, it was necesary to repeat the production PCR for both homologous fragments of the PAA1 KO cassetted.         In this case, isolated genome from BMA64-a1 cells and isolated genome from WT BY4742 cell were used as templates. No specific primers has been created for this PCR, instead the same primers were used        which has been used for previous cassette isolation in BY4742 cells. The usage of tw different templates should show us if the primers are the         problem for the isolation of the two different homologous arms or the PCR working condition are not ok.
Results of the production PCR
Because no bands could not be seen, It was supposed that the problem must be the PCR mastermix and not the primers. Primers should at least        work for the WT BY4742 genome, however also there nothing could be observed.

First measurament with the MT1-GPCR and ß-Arrestin approach:
We prepared overnight cultures with galactose as principal carbon source to activate the production of the MT1 GPCR and ß-Arrestin.
Under presence of melatonin, ß-Arrestin will bind with the MT1 Receptor and the inactive subunits from the beta-galactosidase will be active.
With the addition of X-Gal with melatonin should appear a blue coloring.
Troubleshooting with the assay
Possible lack of Cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) in yeasts hinder the bound between beta-arrestin and MT1.
A low membran permeability for X-Gal impede the reaction with ß-Galactosidase
