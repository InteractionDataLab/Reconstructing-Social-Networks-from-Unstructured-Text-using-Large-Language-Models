purification of proteins
creation of Lysis buffer for SDS gel (pH = 8.0):
Composition:
50 mM NaH2PO4
300 mM NaCl
10 mM Imidazol
50 mM NaH2PO4
50 mM NaH2PO4
Preparation of Samples for SDS gel from E. coli cells
take 5 ml of LB-medium and inoculate with a E.coli colony
incubate at 37째C over night on a shaker
dilute the culture 1:100
incubate the diluted culture at 37째C on a shaker
as soon as an OD600 of 0.5 is hit,  transfer a sample of 1000 uL into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf container and centrifuge at 13000 rpm for 1 min at RT
add 40 ul 1xPBS to the sediment and resuspend
add 10 ul SDS-loading-buffer and incubate on ice
induce the expression of proteins by adding IPTG to the exponentially growing culture
transfer the culture into a falcon and centrifuge at 4500rpm for 15 min at 4째C; discard the supernatant
Bacterial pellets after centrifugation are resuspended in 2.5 ml 1x PBS each and put into a 15 ml falcon tube.
add Lisozym to the cells (end concentration of 2mg/ml)and incubate for 30 minutes on ice
Sonification: Amplitude: 60% and cycle: 0.5. Cells are sonificate on ice four times for 45 s each with pauses of 45 s                                 between the different steps of the sonification.
centrifuge for 20 min at 13 rpm and 4 째C.
Use the supernatant for Ni-NTA-affinity chromatography.
