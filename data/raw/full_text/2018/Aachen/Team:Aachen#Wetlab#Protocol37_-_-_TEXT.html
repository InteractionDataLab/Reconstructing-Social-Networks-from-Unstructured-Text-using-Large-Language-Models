One-step luciferase
measurement in yeasts:
Preparation of (1000 ml):
Creation of 5 ml overnight cultures with SC Medium with the desired aminoacids and selections markers. We used a Gal-promoter for the production of the receptors, therefore we used Galactose as carbon source
Dilute the overnights to OD600 0.6 and let the cells grow until OD600 0.8-1.
90 ul of the cell culture in 96-well microtiterplate and 10ul of the chemical analyte (desired concentration in 10% Ethanol or 1% DMSO)
shake for 20s and incubate by 30ºC during 2.5hours
add 100ul of 10mM Luciferin in a pH of 3 until 5 (diluted in citrat buffer or 1xPBS)
Shake the plate 20s and measure the luminescence within 20seconds.
