Cre-LOXp Treatment of yeast cells:
Material:
YPD+hygromycin (conc. 250 mg/L) plates.
YPD plates.
auxotrophie-media-plates of the auxotrophie you want to remove.
liquid induce-media, with the GAL1-Promotor 100%Galactose YPD-Media.
plasmid containing cre- protein and an inducible promoter upstream (e.g. pSH69 of E.coli Stammnummer 2757 (iAMB)).
Procedure:
Transformation of the cells that have to be treated with the plasmid that contains the gene for the cre-protein. For example the plasmid pSH69 from         E.coli Stammnummer 2757 (iAMB). The protocol will be described in usage of this plasmid, which contains a GAL1 Promoter upstream of the cre-protein-DNA         and a hygromycin Marker Gene.
The Transformants get plated on YPD + hygromycin (conc. 250 mg/L) plates.
When the colonies on the plate grew, use the method "Abschwämmen" to dilute the Colonies on Medium. That means you pour some induce- media onto the        plate, so all colonies are covered with media. Than you remove all the colonies from the plate into the media with a drigalski-spatel or something else.
.Take the media from the plates with all the cells from the colonies in it and pour it into a induce- media, in this case Galactose+YPD -media (because of        the GAL1 Promoter).
Leave the cells in the induce- media for 4-5 h at 28-30 ℃. Now the cre-protein gets expressed and it deletes all the DNA sequences         which are between LOXp- sites.
Plate the cells on a YPD- plate but before prepare a dilution-row (Verduennungsreihe) of the cells in the induce media to get single colonies on the plate.
After grwoth of colonies on the YPD-plate, check 5 colonies or more for success of the cre treatment: You mark 5 colonies or more on the YPD- plate and take half of each to spread them on auxotrophie-media-plates        of exactly the auxotrophie you want to remove from your cells. Only if the cells can NOT grow on the auxotrophie-media-plate, the cre-treatment         was successful!
