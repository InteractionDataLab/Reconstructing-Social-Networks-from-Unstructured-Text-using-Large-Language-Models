Creation of glycerol-stocks of Minigene 32 and Megagene 51
Sarah
2 Eppis:
take 1mL of:
Minigene 32 O.N.
Megagene 51 O.N.
add 1ml of Glycerol 50% stock solution to each plasmid
store at -80°C
Competent BY4742+KO cells from Leu(-) O.N. with kit-protocol
Sarah, Lea
4,5ml YPD-Medium
add 500µL of O.N.
incubate at 30°C for ~4h (shaking)
OD was measured: 1,2
4 mL culture was centrifuged (500 x g, 4min), supernatant discarded
pellet was resuspended in 8mL EZ1, centrifuged, supernatant discarded
pellet was resuspended in 0,4mL EZ2
solutiohn was distributed into 1,5mL tubes (50µL per tube)
cells (BY+PAA1) were frozen slowly at -80°C
