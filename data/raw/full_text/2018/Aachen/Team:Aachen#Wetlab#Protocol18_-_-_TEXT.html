Transformation of S. cerevisiae:
Material:
1 M lithium acetate (LiOAc) → autoclave for 15 min.
0.1 M LiOAc
50 % PEG 3350 in water → autoclave for 15 min.
single stranded carrier DNA → fish sperm DNA, prepare 2 mg/mL solution in dH2O and denature for 5 min at 95 ℃.
Procedure:
preparation of DNA-solution: Combine 0.5-1 ug each of desired fragments (ratio of 1:2 for fragments containing marker         elements to fragments without marker element), bring to a total volume of 34 uL with dH20 (for plasmids, use 100-300 ng).
prepare transformation-mixture (can be scaled up and prepared as master mix):
240 uL 50% PEG 3350.
36 uL 1M LiOAc.
50 uL carrier DNA.
centrifuge aliquot of competent cells (16,000xg, 15 s) → e.g. cryos of competent cells.
resuspend cells in 34 uL (plasmid-)DNA- solution.
add transformation-mixture and vortex gently.
incubate at 30 ℃ for 30 min.
invert tube, then incubate for precisely 30 min at 42 ℃.
centrifuge cells (16,000xg, 15 s).
A) if antibiotic marker is used: resuspend cells in 500 uL YPD and incubate at 30°C and 200 rpm for 3-4 h, afterwards spread on selection medium
B)if there is no antibiotic marker: resuspend pellet in 100 uL A. bidest, spread on selection medium.
