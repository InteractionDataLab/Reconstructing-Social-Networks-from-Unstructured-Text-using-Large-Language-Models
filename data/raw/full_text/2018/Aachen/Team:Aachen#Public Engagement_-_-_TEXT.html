Discussing the Science behind Synthetic Biology
As most people do not know, melatonin plays a significant role in both physical and psychological diseases. During the last couple of months, we presented our project at several occasions.
We talked with young students who participated in the “Jugend forscht” competition. Furthermore, we organized a project at a school, giving the students the opportunity to experience the life of a scientist. In Addition, we were at a radio station to reach out to more people.
Above all, we interviewed the European and Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board to understand how we could make actual change. Enlighten the public is the most important act in changing the currently existing strict law for melatonin medication in the EU.
By doing so, we hoped to get people to recognize the importance of melatonin and raise awareness of sciences.
