Genome Isolation for S. cerevisiae:
Procedure:
pick a large colony and resuspend in 100 uL 0.2 M LiOAC containing 1% SDS.
Solution: mix 1,3196 mg LiOAC, 0,67  mg SDS and 100 µl ddH2O
incubate 10 min at 75 ℃.
add 300 µL 100 % EtOH, vortex.
centrifuge 3 min at max. rpm, discard supernatant.
resuspend pellet in 150 uL 70 % EtOH (→ for 70% EtOH mix 105 ul of 100%-EtOH with 45 ul H2O).
centrifuge 3 min at max. rpm, discard supernatant.
dry pellet at 37 ℃ (place tube upside down).
add 50 uL ddH2O to the dry pellet and vortex shortly.
centrifuge 1 min at max. rpm, use 2 uL supernatant for PCR.
