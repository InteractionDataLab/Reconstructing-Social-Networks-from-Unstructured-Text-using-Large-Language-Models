PCR clean-up
Adjust DNA binding condition
For very small sample volumes 30 ul adjust the volume of the reaction mixture to 50-100 ul with water. It is not necessary to remove          mineral oil.
Mix 1 volume of sample with 2 volumes of Buffer NTI (e.g., mix 100 ul PCR reaction and 200 ul Buffer NTI).
Note: For removal of small fragments like primer dimers dilutions of Buffer NTI can be used instead of 100% Buffer NTI.
Bind DNA
Place a NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Column into a Collection Tube (2 ml) and load up to 700 ul sample.
Centrifuge for 30 s at 11,000 x g. Discard flow-through and place the column back into the collection tube.
Load remaining sample if necessary and repeat the centrifugation step.
Wash silica membrane
Add 700 ul Buffer NT3 to the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Column. Centrifuge for 30 s at 11,000 x g. Discard flow-through           and place the column back into the collection tube.
Recommended: Repeat previous washing step to minimize chaotropic salt carry-over and improve A(260)/A(230) values.
Dry silica membrane
Centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g to remove Buffer NT3 completely. Make sure the spin column does not come in contact           with the flow-through while removing it from the centrifuge and the collection tube.
Note: Residual ethanol from Buffer NT3 might inhibit enzymatic reactions. Total removal of ethanol can be achieved by           incubating the columns for 2-5 min at 70 ℃ prior to elution.
Elute DNA
Place the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Column into a new 1,5 mL microentrifuge tube (not provided). Add 15-30 ul          Buffer NE and incubate at room temperature (18-25 ℃) for 1 min at 11,000 x g.
Note: DNA recovery of larger fragments (>1000 bp) can be increased by multiple elution steps with fresh buffer,          heating to 70 ℃ and incubation for 5 min.
