Resuspension of IDT DNA Oligonucleotide
Procedure:
Resuspend oligos in TE (Tris-EDTA) buffer (10 mM Tris; 0.1 mM EDTA; pH 8.0) as this buffer will maintain a constant pH.        Alternatively, use nuclease-free water (Not DEPC)
Resuspend dry oligonucleotides to a storage stock concentration of 100 uM and then dilute a portion of this to create         working stock solutions.
storage stock concentration:
Suspend the primers in the IDT tubes
To make a 100 uM concentration stock solution (as backup in the IDT tube): Take the number of nmoles in the tube         (from the tube-label) and multiply that by 10. This will be the number of μL buffer to add to get a 100 μM solution.
Incubate for at least 15 minutes.
The tube can be stored at -20 ℃.
PCR working stock:
Take a new tube for this stock.
To get 100 uL 5 uM solution, mix 5 uL of 100 uM oligo stock with 95 uL of water or TE buffer.
Use the 5 uM stock for the PCR Mastermix and store the rest at -20 ℃.
Tips:
If you want a different concentration than 100 uM or 5 uM you can use        the IDT Dilution Calculator ( IDT Dilution Calculator )
