			of our university who helped us to achieve our goal of redefining melatonin measurement. 
			Actually, without the support of these people it would not have been possible to realize our project.</B><H3>ABBt Team Schwaneberg</H3><P>The Schwaneberg laboratory helped us all along our project as we could not only work there, but also ask their employees any question and always get advice.</P><H3>Volkan Besirlioglu</H3><P>He works in the Schwaneberg Laboratory at the RWTH Aachen University. Especially, he shared his experiences and advice with us while we were organizing the conference in Utrecht.</P><H3>Wolfgang Gloy and Christian Simons</H3><P>They both work in the Schwaneberg Laboratory at the RWTH Aachen University. They particularly helped us with ordering chemicals and managing other issues.</P><H3>Dr. Islam Elawaad</H3><P>He works in the Schwaneberg Laboratory at the RWTH Aachen University. He provided us with advice when we had trouble with our yeast cells as they were not growing.</P><H3>Isabell Hofmann</H3><P>She works in the Schwaneberg Laboratory at the RWTH Aachen University. She especially helped with everyday struggles. </P><H3>Simone Hotz</H3><P>She works in the Department of Ecosystem Analysis at the RWTH Aachen University. She taught us how to do luminescence measurements.</P><H3>Institute of Biology VII (Molecular Biology)</H3><P>They supported us during the entire project as we could work in their laboratory.</P><H3>Antje Gent</H3><P>She is an employee at Promega. During iGEM, she repeatedly supported us with materials and advice.</P><H3>Department of Food and Environmental Sciences, University of Helsinki and Department of Biochemistry, University of Turku</H3><P>They provided us with the yeast strain BMA which contains the ERE-binding domain and luciferase.</P><H3>Dr. Andreas Ludwig</H3><P>He works at the faculty of medicine at the RWTH Aachen University. He provided us with advice and contacts, especially in the very beginning of our project. For example, he instructed us in the lab.</P><H3>Stefan Scholz</H3><P>Stefan is a PhD candidate at the Institute of Semiconducter Electronics. He manufactured the gold nano structured wafer for our project. We could not have done this without him as we did neither have the expensive machinery nor the expertise. Also, he was a great help in talking about our general setup.</P><H3>Georg Koening</H3><P>Georg is a PhD candidate at the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology at the Chair for Technology of Optical Systems. He was a great help in validating and improving our diy spectrometer. With his access to a commercial spectrometer we were able to validate our own and tried to validate our wafer.</P><H3>Dr. Ahmed Mourran</H3><P>Dr. Mourran is a senior researcher at the DWI Leibniz Institute for Interactive Materials and helped us to understand the plasmon resonance phenomena. Also, in discussions with him we realized that we should change our setup from reflectance to transmission.</P><H3>Dr. Florian Merget</H3><P>Florian is a staff scientist at the Institute of Integrated Photonics and helped us with the layout of our LSPR sensor. After his feedback we went from an optical fiber setup to a simpler and cheaper transmission setup with a glass wafer.</P><H3>Jan Thar and Marcel Lahaye</H3><P>Jan and Marcel are both PhD candidates at the Media Computing Group and gave us access to the Fablab, a makerspace at RWTH Aachen University. Jan also helped us with the SMD soldering.</P><H3>Dr. Dimitry Chigrin</H3><P>Dr. Chigrin is an adjunct professor and group leader for Theory of complex materials at the DWI Leibniz Institute for Interactive Materials and explained to us that we could use fanon interference in our setup. He got us into contact with Sebastian Meyer.</P><H3>Sebastian Meyer</H3><P>Sebstian is a PhD candidate at the I. Institute of Physics. He did simulations for us to find a setup where fanon interference would occur.</P><H3>Esben Rossel</H3><P>Esben is the architect of the firmware of the TCD1304 linear CCD sensor. He answered a lot of naive questions from us regarding the TCD1304 sensor. </P><H3>Dr. Birger Berghoff</H3><P>Dr. Berghoff is the chief engineer at the Institute of Semiconducter Electronics and helped us with getting in touch with the right people for the manufacturing of the wafer.</P><H3>Natalie Bruger</H3><P>Natalie works at the II. Institute of Physics RWTH Aachen University in Juelich and helped us to understand the manufacturing process (E-Beam and liftoff) for the wafer.</P><H3>A good friend яди</H3><P>Though he does not want to be mentioned by name, he helped us with IT matters during our project.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV><FOOTER class="footer-layout"><DIV class="container-fluid"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-2"><P style="margin-top: 18px; letter-spacing:1.5px;"><B>CONTACT US:</B><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen/impressum">impressum</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
