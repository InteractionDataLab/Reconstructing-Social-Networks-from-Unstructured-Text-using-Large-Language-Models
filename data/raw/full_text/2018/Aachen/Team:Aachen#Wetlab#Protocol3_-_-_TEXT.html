Gel clean-up
Excise DNA fragment/solubilize gel slice
Note: Minimize UV exposure time to avoid damaging the DNA.
Take a clean scalpel to excise the DNA fragment from an agarose gel. Remove all excess agarose.
Determine the weight of the gel slice and transfer it to a clean tube.
For each 100 mg of agarose gel < 2 % add 200 uL Buffer NTI.
For gels containing <2 % agarose, double the volume of Buffer NTI.
Incubate sample for 5-10 min at 50 ℃. Vortex the sample briefly every 2-3 min until the gel slice is completely dissolved!
Bind DNA
Place a NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Column into a Collection Tube (2 ml) and load up to 700 ul sample.
Centrifuge for 30 s at 11,000 x g. Discard flow-through and place the column back into the collection tube.
Load remaining sample if necessary and repeat the centrifugation step.
Wash silica membrane
Add 700 ul Buffer NT3 to the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Column. Centrifuge for 30 s at 11,000 x g. Discard           flow-through and place the column back into the collection tube.
Recommended: Repeat previous washing step to minimize chaotropic salt carry-over and improve A(260)/A(230) values.
Dry silica membrane
Centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g to remove Buffer NT3 completely. Make sure the spin column does not come in contact           with the flow-through while removing it from the centrifuge and the collection tube.
Note: Residual ethanol from Buffer NT3 might inhibit enzymatic reactions. Total removal of ethanol can be achieved by           incubating the columns for 2-5 min at 70 ℃ prior to elution.
Elute DNA
Place the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Column into a new 1,5 mL microentrifuge tube (not provided).           Add 15-30 ul Buffer NE and incubate at room temperature (18-25 ℃) for 1 min at 11,000 x g.
Note: DNA recovery of larger fragments (>1000 bp) can be increased by multiple elution steps with           fresh buffer, heating to 70 ℃ and incubation for 5 min.
