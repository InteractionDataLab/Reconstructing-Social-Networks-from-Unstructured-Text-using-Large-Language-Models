Production of TSS-medium
Preparation(50 ml):
5 g PEG 8000
1.5 mL 1M MgCl2 (or 0.30g MgCl2*6H20)
2.5 mL DMSO
filter sterilise the component (0.22 um filter) in a sterile bottle under the clean bench
Notes:
PEG 3350 can be used instead of PEG 8000. According to the original CT Chung paper, PEG 3350 produces better         efficiency, and other sized PEGs can be used as well albeit with a slight loss in efficiency. pH from original Chung         CT paper calls for pH to be acidic (pH=6.5). be sure to pH solution before sterilization.
If using non-chemically resistant filters (e.g., cellulose nitrate), add DMSO after sterilization. DMSO should be        sterile in and of itself, so it may be prudent it add it afterwards if you are unsure about the compatibility of your filters.
storage:
Between +4 ℃ and -20 ℃.
