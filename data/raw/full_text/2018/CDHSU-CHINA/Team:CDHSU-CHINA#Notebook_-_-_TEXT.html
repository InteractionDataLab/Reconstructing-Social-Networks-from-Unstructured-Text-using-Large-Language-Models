NoteBook
February, 2018, our team established
May, 2018, we began our first stage experiments, including collection of miracle fruit’s RNA and design of primer of PCR
June, 2018, the primer we designed was available. Then we did digestion and reconstruction of plasmid experiments, and we transfer the reconstructed plasmid into E.coli. The preparation for stage 2 experiment was finished.
July and august, 2018, we had more time to do the main experiment
July, 2018, we bought pve5523, a vital part of our main experiment. Then we began our stage 2 experiment. We doubly digested the reconstructed plasmid and DNA of miracle fruit, and we connected those two together to get a reconstructed expressing plasmid
The end of July, 2018, we began our interlab experiments, including calibration 1, calibration 2, and calibration 3.
The beginning of August, 2018, we did cell measurement. At the middle of August, we improved our interlab experiment and the new data was accepted by IGEM authority
August and September, we finished the experiment that transferring the reconstructed expressing plasmid into E.coli. After we confirmed that DNA of miracle fruit can be expressed in E.coli, we transferred the reconstructed plasmid into lactic acid bacteria and fostered the trans-genetic lactic acid bacteria in September
October, 2018, we examined that miracle fruit’s DNA was successfully expressed in trans-genetic lactic acid bacteria.
