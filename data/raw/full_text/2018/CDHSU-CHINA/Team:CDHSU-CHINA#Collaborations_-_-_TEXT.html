All experiments were conducted at Sichuan University with team SCU-China
With SCU-China
All experiments were conducted at Sichuan University with team SCU-China. Team members from Sichuan University provided us many beneficial suggestions on experiment designing, inspiring us to solve problems. Without their help, we would not be able to complete all of our experiments with the same efficiency.All experiments were conducted at Sichuan University with team SCU-China.

And gave us some fabulous suggestions on parts section.
With UESTC-China
University of Electronic Science and Technology of China held a lecture to our team and give us a total introduction on iGEM. They helped us to know about iGEM and explained how to set up teams and how to register the competition in detail. This year, the university established their 2018 iGEM team, UESTC-China. Since then, we have been guided by them how to fulfill the criteria and giving instruction to our team when deciding on our project.
