We strictly follow the standardized procedures that corresponds to level 1 biosafety level
During the whole project, we strictly follow the standardized procedures that corresponds to level 1 biosafety level. For personal protection, all students and instructors involved in the project have to equip outfit of experiment operation in order to enter the laboratory , including glove, mask, and protection suit.
For safety reason, we are not allowed to bring any sample out of the laboratory. Any waste and abandoned sample must be sterilized under high pressure condition. To avoid mistakes operation, all operators must be carefully instructed and directed before the experiment by specialists of biosafety. For all materials that used in our project, all samples must be released under sterilized environment. During the whole operation about microorganism including inter-lab, we must operate in the Biosafety cabinet. All samples are free of any biothreat, as well. For example, DH5 alpha, the colibacillus strain we used in the experiment, is avirulent, assuring the biosafety of the project.
