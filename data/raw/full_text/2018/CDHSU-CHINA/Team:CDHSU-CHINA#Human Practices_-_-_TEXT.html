Several members of our team went to the campus for introduction
Propaganda
In order to let more people know about our project, several members of our team went to the campus for introduction. At the same time, our team members realized that some students did not know much about biology. Therefore, in order to give students a better understanding of our program, we offered two lectures that offered a simple view of the molecular level of biology.
In the first lecture, we introduced the concept of synthetic biology. Starting with Leeuwenhoek's cell theory, we show how human explanations of organisms change, and how we use biochemistry as a tool to understand organisms at the molecular level. We also integrated the core concepts of bioengineering: modularity and standardization.
In our second lecture, our lecturers showed the whole process of a typical genetic engineering experiment, from obtaining the genetic sequences, to cloning: building vectors, transformation, and finally identification. We wanted our audiences to know how the common technology is used in genetic technology, such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), aids in understanding the purpose of our machine and its abundant usefulness. Since these concepts are abstract, we presented them through text, pictures, and videos. After each lecture, we provided a ‘Questions and Answering’ section, helping our audiences better understand these concepts. During explaining, we want to give our audience a better understanding of our project, The mysterious fruit. Several listeners were invited to experience it.
Engagement
Synthetic biology is incredible. We took every opportunity to teach others about it and our project. We have hosted regular events to engage the public in our work, iGEM and synthetic biology. This year we had done some specific propaganda, gave several talks, held an iGEM open evening and also held numerous workshops for younger students at our school.
