5/28/18; Meeting
Today we conducted our weekly lab meeting. It is my first time back in lab since coming down with the flu last week. Currently, we have all constructs cloned into BL21 and have successfully expressed the constructs. We will perform protein purification of the CR2_Gag-Prot-RT, CR2_Integrase, and CR5_RH-Integrase constructs. We are hoping to observe autocatalytic activity of the protease in the CR2_Gag-Prot-RT construct which will allow us to better determine the sizes of our mature pol proteins.
