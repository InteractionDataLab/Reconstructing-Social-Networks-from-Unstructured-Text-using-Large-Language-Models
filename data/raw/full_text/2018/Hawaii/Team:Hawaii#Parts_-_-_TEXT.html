Click on the name of each part in the table to be taken to the Registry and hover over our parts in the dark left panel to see general information.           Each part is comprised of a N-terminal purification tag (8X histidine and TEV cleavage site) for nickel resin purification. This is followed by a Gag sequence         that expresses the components for virus-like particle formation.
