This week marked the start of our initial laboratory experiments. Plasmids were prepped and bacteria were transformed with CR2 constructs. Plasmids were also sent in for sequencing to verify that the constructs were valid.

Add 11 µL of PCR grade H20 to each PCR tube.
BL21 colonies are located in 4 C fridge. On the colony PCR plate, create a grid with 16 blocks.
Use a 10 µL pipette to dab at a single white colony (avoid colonies that seem blobbed together). If you think the tip touched another colony, dispose tip and do a new one. Dab 2-3 times on the cell in the colony PCR grid. Eject the tip into a PCR tube. Once you've done 8 (to fill 8 PCR tubes), continue to streak all 16 cells in the grid.
Prepare the PCR reaction master mix into an Eppendorf tube. Mix and centrifuge.
Remove the tips from the PCR tubes w/ a pipette and expel any liquid from the tip.
Add 4 µL of master mix to each PCR tube, mix by pipetting.
Spin down in mini-centrifuge (next to PCR machine)

More bacteria were prepared with the insert for subsequent experiments.
Materials/Methods:  *We prepared 2 tubes per colony and used colonies 3,4, and 7 from BL21 CR2 Gag-Prot-RT Colony PCR plate stored in the -4 C freezer. For each colony:
Fill one falcon tube with:
30 mL LB (Luria Broth)
30 µL Ampicillin (100 µg/mL conc.)
30 µL Chlorampheltcol (50 µg/mL conc.)
Mix thoroughly.
Pour 15 mL into the 2nd tube.
Inoculate by touching the respective colony with a 10 µL pipette tip and dipping (swirling into the falcon tube).
Place falcon tubes in the shaking incubator at 37 C, 225 RPM.
Results: We incubated overnight on 5/23 from ~ 2:25 pm Completed By: Fernanda, Gina
5/24/2018
Resuspended internal Gag-Prot-RT primers and prepared working solution from stock.
Materials/Methods:
Primer Resuspension
Look on primer tube for XX nanomol number. Multiply this number by 10.
Add that much TE buffer in µL (if 39.6 nanomol, add 396 µL TE).
Briefly vortex.
Place on ice for 5 minutes.
Briefly vortex.
Store in -20 C (stock solution).
Working Solution
Take 10 µL stock solution.
Add 90 µL TE buffer.
Place on ice while working with it.
Store in -20 C afterwards.
Notes: We received 2 primers today (Gag 12 and Gag 14) that are internal primers to help sequence the middle section of our ~2.3kb insert. We only were able to sequence ~500 terminal nt of our Gag-Prot-RT construct so the middle primers will be used to sequence the middle portions. Based on Dr.Presting's analysis of the CR2 Gag-Prot-RT alignments in Ryan's folder, we determined that Gag 12 is the forward and Gag 14 is the reverse primer.
