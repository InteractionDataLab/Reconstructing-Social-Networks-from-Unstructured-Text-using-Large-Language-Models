HUMAN PRACTICES
Centromeric retrotransposable (CR) elements utilize a natural transportation system to package and carry genes to functional centromeres. While its potential role in gene delivery     will need to be continuously investigated, introducing a complex system to improve quality of life needs to be done in a careful way. The public, especially our youth, will need to be aware of     what this system will entail to make informed decisions about its use when the opportunity to do so arises.
ENGAGING OUR YOUTH
We thus created a typing game, Biotyper, that will allow students to explore some of the images depicting cell components and processes while typing through their descriptions. Although       the descriptions may be too hard to understand at first, we hope this sparks     interest in the younger community to start investigating what the images mean. These images are from the Cell Image Library and students are encouraged to explore what the image entails even further by researching terms that they are unfamiliar with online.
