Semantic Containment System
These parts collectively provide proof of concept for a semantic containment system that can prevent a horizontally transferred gene being read and expressed by any environmental cell that has picked it up. Our probability modelling predicts that a gene that has 5 and 10 amber STOP codons substituted into the coding sequence will only be expressed 1 in every 1010 and 1 in every 1018 translation attempts. This is confirmed by growth curves for Top10 E. coli transformed with P1003 5* and P1003 10*. No kanamycin resistance is observed from these strains. When P1003 5* is expressed alongside J23108-supD , high level expression of the P1003 gene is achieved and confers kanamycin resistance in the strain. These parts together model a functional semantic containment system.
