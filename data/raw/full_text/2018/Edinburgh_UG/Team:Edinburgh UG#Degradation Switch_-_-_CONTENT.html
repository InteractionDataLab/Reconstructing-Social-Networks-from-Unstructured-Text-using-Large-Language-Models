With only pImm transformed (left of first red line) we observe Imm2 mRNA very rapidly reaching equilibrium and Imm2 also reaching equilibrium shortly after. pCol is transformed (between first and second red lines) and reaches a much lower equilibirum at a slower rate compared to Imm2 due its larger size and hence slower rates of transcription (of Colicin E2 mRNA) and translation. Maxicell formation occurs (at second red line) and pImm is as a result linearized, we observe an immediate spike in Imm2 production due to the now longer halflife of Imm2 when in non-dividing Maxicells however this quickly drops as no new Imm2 mRNA is produced. We can also observe considerably higher Colicin E2 expression once maxicells are formed which is again due the longer halflife of proteins when not being diluted due to cell division. Free Colicin E2 becomes present at 19.6 hours and hence DNA degradation occurs and maxicells are deactivated.</P><P style="text-align:left"> Figure 3 displays the distribution of different killswitch activation times obtained by screening across Anderson Promoters and Ribosome Binding Sites.

Run 684 was selected to be used as the basis for our part design due to its 11.45 hour activation time which we deemed long enough when tested in the wet lab to validate the production of a significant delay before degradation switch activation and yet short enough not to make validation too laborious.

The main simplification which may contribute to inaccurate results was to not account for leakiness in the expression of <I>I-SceI</I> which may cause premature linearization of pImm and hence premature activation of degradation switch due to a lack of data on the leakiness of the arabinose promoter under which <I>I-SceI</I> is expressed. We felt secure that this simplification would not have a major impact on our predictions due to the observation that maxicell progenitor strain DL2524 does not spontaneously decay into maxicells without induction of <I>I-SceI</I> by addition of arabinose as would happen if this promoter was significantly leaky.
