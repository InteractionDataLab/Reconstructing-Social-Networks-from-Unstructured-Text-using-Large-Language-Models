You are very good in your field but still, some piece of a puzzle is missing in order to see the whole picture? It is not a problem at all if you are open and not afraid to ask for help or to offer yours. Meeting other people while working on a science project is also essential. Other people with their fresh mind might easily notice a reason why something is not working properly, suggest solutions or inspire with a new direction.

We would expect to see a number of small DNA fragments from the maxicells degraded chromosome and bands corresponding to our 2 constructs pImm and pCol. After degradation switch activation we would expect to observe the bands corresponding to our plasmid constructs dissapear as Colicin E2 degrades maxicell DNA. Due to our need to visualise potentially very small DNA fragments we propose to use SYBR Green I Nucleic Acid Gel Stain or some similar high sensitivity strain.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV><SECTION id="about" class="content-section text-center"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-8 mx-auto"><H2 style="text-align:left"><B>Meetups</B></H2><P style="text-align:left">iGEM teams meetups was some of the most useful collaborations we had.
