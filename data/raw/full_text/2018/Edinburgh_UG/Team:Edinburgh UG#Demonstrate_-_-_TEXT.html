All aspects of our project combine to provide a novel chassis for Synthetic Biology: Maxicells. These maxicells are easy to use and can be safely deployed into the environment through the use of our Triple Lock System.
Maxicell Characterisation
We have assessed various methods of maxicell production and have concluded that they are easy to make through UV exposure and homing endonuclease action
Our knockdown construct BBa_K2725008 allows maxicell production by theoretically any strain of E. coli
We have shown that maxicells can function as a biosensor
The active lifespan of maxicells was found to be enough for real-world applications: over 18 hours
The Triple Lock System
We have developed a model that allows fine-tuning of the maxicell lifespan through the use of a Colicin E2 kill switch
Semantic containment of our plasmid DNA was demonstrated as a feasible method of preventing expression of our genes by foreign organisms, whilst allowing expression in our chassis.
Triclosan was successfully used as a selection marker as an alternative to antibiotic resistance and a new, triclosan resistant plasmid backbone was produced
When put together, our final maxicell product would therefore have virtually no risk to the biosphere upon environmental release.
