Our team is proud to state that we conceived the idea for Maxed OOT and subsequently designed and carried out all experiments ourselves. That said, there are many advisors who we would like to thank for helping to provide continuous advice and support, because, without them, we would not have been able to have achieved our aims.
Team Members
Eva Steele worked on the 2nd lock in our Triple Lock System - semantic containment
Freddie Starkey worked on mathematical modelling, building wiki and DNA degradation switch.
Ben Astles worked on the 3rd lock in our Triple Lock System - alternative selection
Charlie Mathews designed and carried out the experimentation that tested the protocols for making maxicells, and characterised the methods that were easiest and most efficient
Samuel Grainger was mainly involved in design and construction of FabI and FabV parts, and was involved wet lab work and part design in other sides of the project
Inga Grazulyte contributed to both the biosensor and Interlab work, helped with graphical analysis of the data obtained, chief of social media, and our team photographer
Tommy Schmidlechner desgined and assembled all MicC constructs
Ugne Baronaite worked on demonstrating the application of maxicells as biosensors, contributed to InterLab study
Ajay Joshi designed and carried out the experimentation for quantifying the Active Metabolic Time frame of our maxicells
Victoria Collins presented our team at iGEM UK meetup at Oxford
Supervisors and Advisors
Prof. Christopher French Gave feedback on all parts of project, in particular lab work, experimental design. Also allowed to use lab space once we could no longer use a teaching lab during the semester.
Holly Robertson-Dick supervised us throughout all the project, advised on human practises, looked after us to make everything go smoothly
Dr Heather Barker lab supervisor who was always there and gave feedback for all parts of the project, trained us to use lab equipment and help troubleshoot when things went wrong.
Dr Annagret Honsbein lab supervisor, looked after us to ensure the experiments go well
Dr Filippo Menolascina modelling supervisor, gave advice on presentation
Dr David Clarke supervisor, helped with all parts of the project, escpecially data analysis
Prof. Alistair Elfick supervised us throughout all the project, gave feedback about the progression of our project
Michael McDonald advised on wet lab work
Project Support
Dr. Jane Calvert Helped the team in several meetings where she gave feedback on our approach to human practices and how likely our team was to achieve the various medal criteria.
Dr Rob Smith Helped the team in several meetings where she gave feedback on our approach to human practices and how likely our team was to achieve the various medal criteria
Dr David Hills supervised us during experiments.
Dr Elise Cachat advised us on project planning and academic work.
Alan Isbister provided technical services and equipment.
Jackson DeKloe Edinburgh_OG team member, helped with InterLab study
Prof. Martin Waterfall Allowed the use of flow cytometer for the InterLab study and teached us principles of flow cytometry
Dr Elise Darmon Provided us DAPI, allowed us to use the Leach Lab fluoresence microscope, helped us greatly with microscopy result interpretation, provided us with strain named DL2524 and DL3355 and explained to us how it functioned.
Prof. David Leach Gave us advice on maxicell production and recomended us to try DL2524 and DL3355
Chris French Lab and Paulina Kanigowska, Marcos Valenzuela Ortega, Felipe A. Millacura for sharing their  lab space once we could no longer use a teaching lab during the semester and helping us with our experiments
McCormick lab For allowing Eva to use lab space and equipment for the semantic containment side of the project
Sean Colloms dvised on the use of amber suppression for preventing horizontal gene transfer
Molly Simmons design our project logo
Migle Siauciulyte design our team logo
Ale Schiavon advised on cloning work for the semantic containment side of the project
William Jackson Albert Bartlett representative who discussed with us attitudes towards GMO release and the usefullness of a maxicell chassis in agricultre.
Dr Jon Dempsey provided consultation on future use of our Maxicell chassis in Synthetic Biology and industry
We also want to thank everyone who has helped and shared a piece of advice throughout the project. Your time and patience is truly appreciated!
