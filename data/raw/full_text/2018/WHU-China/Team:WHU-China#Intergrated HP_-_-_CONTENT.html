    Our project is to develop a system that can use solar energy to recover specific elements from water bodies to directly repair environmental water bodies. At the same time, this part of the recovered elements is reused as resources. It is very clean. An ideal, resource-friendly means of environmental restoration. The establishment of our system is not a one-step process. This is built step by step in our process of thinking about how to better deal with the problem of eutrophication caused by excessive phosphorus in environmental waters. Finally, we discovered the system we built can be applied to the processing of other elements. In the process, some HP plays a decisive role. In the integrated HP category, we will detail how these HPs directly influence the direction of our project design—the impact of society and the environment on our projects.

    Our design steps

1. I want to deal with phosphorus, but considering that the treated phosphorus is difficult to release and reuse, we want to use biological methods to concentrate phosphorus – bio-conveyor

2. Considering environmental resistance and nitrogen stress, etc. - introduction of bacterial and algal symbiosis system and biofilm system


3. The problem of loose biofilms - adding part makes the biofilm more stable

4. Considering that the energy input can use all solar energy, and considering that the current method of repairing polluted water in China is mainly to treat sewage, we directly design a device to let our bacteria take the initiative to repair the environmental sewage – Noah’s Ark


The first two steps are directly changed by HP, and the latter design is also completed with the help of some HP.

      Among them, the HP part marked with a light blue frame is the integrated HP related to the project, and the green part is the core of the integrated HP. The following details the detailed parts of these HPs, and how these four HPs have changed our Design

candlelight navigation—— communicate with professor like a friend


The college students who just entered the school have many confusions. “Candlelight navigation” is an opportunity for them to communicate with experienced professor. Last summer, as freshmen, we had an unforgettable conversation with Professor Lu Xin.
As a professor that majors in bird ecology, he stressed the importance of environmental protection for many times. I still remember the words he said on that day:” The water of the East Lake of Wuhan used to be so clear that there were always many teachers and students swimming in it…
However, because of the deterioration of the ecological environment and excessive sewage discharge, the East Lake was once covered with a layer of horrible green film. 
Since then, we have no longer seen anyone swimming or playing in the lake…”
 </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="div"><DIV class="div_w2"><P style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
	font-size: 1.5em;">
      East Lake is located in Hubei Province, you can see part of it from the Gate of Wuhan University, the once beautiful East Lake. . .


Eutrophication is a big problem in China, 
In the past few decades, many beautiful rivers and lakes have become no longer clear due to eutrophication, and the delicate ecosystem has been destroyed. East Lake is one of them…

I still remember l went to see East Lake on my first day in WuHan university.


Since then, this sentence has been lingering in our minds because we can’t control ourselves not to imagine the picture.
After a year, Five people from the six at that time joined iGEM. The purpose of the competition was to make the world a better place. At that time, we set the initial direction for our ideas (time 2017.5). 
In the following year, we have been thinking about how to solve the problem of eutrophication more effectively.


In the end, we determined our project – phosphorus accumulation, the content of phosphorus is the key to eutrophication. At the same time, we consider that the general phosphorus removal process is to directly fill the sludge containing phosphorus, because it is impossible to achieve &quot;bacteria phosphorus separation&quot;. the release of phosphorus is introduced in our design, so that the phosphorus collected from the environment can be controlled by people and released as resources for reuse. It is a resource-friendly environmental treatment.

Core integrated human practice


After we discussed our thoughts with the professor Mao of the collage of Resources and Environment, he gave us some advice: If you really want your ideas to become reality, you must consider the survival of the bacteria when they are exposed to contaminated water. We have not done too much thinking about the resistance of bacteria before, it is really a big problem because we can’t solve this problem by just adding a few pathways. 


At the same time, we have consulted a lot of literature, we also found that some environmental factors such as nitrogen content will not only affect the growth of bacteria, but also affect the efficiency of phosphorus accumulation.


We came across a big problem and finally we went to the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences for help, a teacher there introduce a very advanced methods to treat the sewage—the symbiotic system of bacteria and algae! He also introduced us a symbiotic biofilm system, which is so helpful for our design and project improvement.

 </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="div"><DIV class="div_w3"><P style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
	font-size: 1em;">
   The symbiotic system can greatly improve the resistance of bacteria and also, the algae can reduce nitrogen content in water. The EPS(extracellular poly substances) can trap almost all kinds of harmful chemical agents. The problem that troubled us can be completely solved by introducing a symbiotic system, and even make it better!


After that, we improve our project and carefully re-design the whole system!


Our laboratory conditions are unable to culture and monitor algae. Fortunately, we have cooperated with the Aquatic Institute and we sent a member of the experimental group to the Aquatic institute to complete the experiment of symbiotic and biofilm formation with the guidance of teachers!

Visit Bluepha！


During the communication with Bluepha, alumnus Wang Boxiang affirmed our project and gave important suggestions for the selection and guidance of optical switches and the development of follow-up experiments.


We talked about our project in detail. The most troublesome thing for us at the time was the search for optical switches. He recommended two very valuable documents for us. Finally, we decided to use CcaS/R optical switch system.


He also gave us a follow-up experiment grouping and expanded recommendations, which were really helpful.
