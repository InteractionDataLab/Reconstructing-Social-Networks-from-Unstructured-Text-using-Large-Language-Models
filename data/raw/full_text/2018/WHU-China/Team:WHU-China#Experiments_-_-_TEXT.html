Experiment
As this is a very big project and we do not have proper instrument to conduct experiment in the lab of our university, we seek for help from institute of hydrobiology, Chinese academy of science (IHBCAS), which can provide us with advanced experimental facilities and the researchers there are willing to instruct us. Therefore, we divide our group into two subgroups and carry out experiment in a two-parallel-line way. One is molecular biology subgroup in scientific training lab of Wuhan University and the other is algae-bacteria symbiotic system subgroup in IHBCAS.
