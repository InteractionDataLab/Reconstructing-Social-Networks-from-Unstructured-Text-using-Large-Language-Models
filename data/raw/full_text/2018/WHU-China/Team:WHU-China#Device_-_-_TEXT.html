We will introduce the Noah’s Ark device in this page.
This Ark works by using solar energy to “extract specific pollutant” out of the environment and making it a resource again. This is a very fundamental approach to achieve environmental remediation and maintenance. We hope it can save the environment one day, just like how the real Noah’s Ark saves the human being.
Our Ark will float on the water(river, lake or ocean).
Then conveyor rotates into the interior, and releases the element into recycling pool.
Thus, bacteria will travel like this: turbine1-recycling pool-turbine2-replenishment pool
Turbines allow the water but no organism pass through. Conveyor can absorb the element in turbine. （Green light here to activate one functional protein）
The replenishment pool is at the above position and connected with the upper space, the upper space is filled with the algae liquid. In the replenishment pool, the biofilm on the conveyor can receive the sunlight to get energy supplement. At the same time, the liquid can replenish the  biofilm to make up for the loss of algae in rotating process.
Recycling pool is a place where conveyor will release the element in a purified form. After releasing the element, the next round absorption-replenishment-absorption-release begins. Continuously, Noah’s Ark specifically collect that element.
This year we came up with this idea and we also made a three dimensional modelling of the Ark. However, we didn’t set the parameters that are strictly correspond to the application to maximize the efficiency. In fact, the verification of each module consumes a lot of energy. The assembly of the modules and the production of the products are the essential things that what we will do in the next iGEM season.
