3+net is a new concept in the environment track, jointly proposed by ECUST-China and many other universities in China. The purpose is to provide guidance and reference for the iGEM team and bioremediation field. 3+net separately elaborated from the three perspectives of application, biosecurity and society, and explored the relationship among the three.
 
 In order to provide more feasible suggestions for others and better translate laboratory results into technologies with social value, 3+net summarize the protocols for general bacterial resistance elimination from the application point of view; The suicide switch and mechanism, summed up the hardware of various scenarios of soil, water and air; from the social perspective, formulated iGEMer's laws and regulations on bioremediation from China, and investigated the opinions of Chinese people on applying biotechnology to environmental governance. 3+net provides a universal solution to the current problems, which will greatly promote the development of bioremediation.</P></DIV><DIV class="c_row"><DIV class="c_row" style="width:500px;float:left;"><P style="font-size:24px;">

As a member of 3+net, we took on the task of hardware. This is somehow a big problem. Every year, many “environment track” teams develop amazing biological pathways, which provides the possibility to solve some practical problems. However, time is limited. As for the platform of the application-hardware device, these teams will encounter difficulties more or less. Many teams are taking the detours that others have already traveled over and over again. We hope to solve this problem - in fact, many teams' projects are consistent in the application scenario, we can classify these application scenarios and provide an optimal hardware template for each situation. In the future, the team can find a template and modify it to suit their projects.</P><H2>2.With SYSU</H2><P style="font-size:24px;">
We met up with the iGEM team SYSU-China in May, introducing each other's projects, teams and experiments, sharing some experience in modeling, and exchanging ideas. We built strong friendship with each other.

In September, in order to solve the problem of simultaneous measurement of the rate of detachment of bacteria and algae, two-wavelength method was established based on Beer-Lambert Law. After obtaining experimental data, we needed to verify the accuracy of the two-wavelength method by modeling and data analysis. Team SYSU-China had given us a lot of help in data analysis, and to some extent proved the reliability of the method.</P></DIV><DIV class="c_row" style="clear:both;"><H2>3.With Team SUIS Alpha</H2><DIV style="width:550px;float:right;"><P style="font-size:24px;">
On June 16th, the Shanghai Pinghe High School team came to our school. Since we both contain bacteria and algae symbiosis in project, we gave guidance on the overall framework of design and experiment to them. In the original design, they wanted bacteria to express a small molecule (iron carrier) so that they could better achieve the purpose of manufacturing. We emphasized the importance of pre-experiment for them and suggested that it should be carried out with pure chemical molecules. Moreover, it should be emphasized that the engineered bacteria transformation and expression could be carried out after the pre-experiment success.

On July 31, 2018, the high school team worldshaper-wuhan came to visit us. In addition to giving them introduction on the project, we took the initiative to help them contact the community and provide them with a platform to showcase project and broadcast synthetic biology.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="c_row" style="clear:both;"><H2>5.iGEM Central China Regional Conference and with HUST</H2><P style="font-size:24px;">At the beginning of this summer, team Hust-China held the 5th Central China Regional Conference. Although there were not many experiments results in the presentation, but the design was basically completed. We presented our projects and communicated with each other. 
We knew about that the project of team Hust-China this year also involved the symbiosis of bacteria and algae, and they plan to use it to generate electricity. We have discussed experiments on symbiotic co-culture of algae. What’s more, our project - the automatic water element recovery device and theirs- usage of bacteria and algae for power generation also have a high degree of upstream and downstream cooperation relationship.
</P><P style="font-size:24px;">In addition, Hust-China team also helped us to freeze the parts and helped us solve the problem of sending samples.</P></DIV><DIV class="c_row" style="clear:both;"><H2>6.CCiC meeting</H2><P style="font-size:24px;">In summer, we participate in the biggest iGEMer communication meeting in China——CCiC. This meeting attracted nearly all teams in China, which is a brilliant platform for us to communicate, to learn and to reflect. During these wonderful days in Shanghai, not only did we broaden our horizon but also we got many suggestions on our project from other groups, for example XMU, SDU and HZAU. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="c_row" style="width:1200px;"><DIV class="c_row" style="clear:both;"><H2 style="clear:both;">7.With Team_HZAU and Team_SDU</H2><P style="font-size:24px;">We were not the only team working on optical switch-CcaS/R, Team_SDU-China(2018) also  worked on it. We communicated with each other about the data and stressed the importance of the &quot;leakage expression&quot;. What's more, Team_HZAU-China(2017) worked on it too and modified the pathway  to make it a 2.0 version, which makes it have a lower leakage expression.We wrote in wiki that in the next iGEM season we may improve our system, actually we may try the DNA that HZAU modified at that time!
