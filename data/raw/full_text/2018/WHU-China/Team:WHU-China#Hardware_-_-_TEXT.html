This hardware corresponds to the "interference selection and the establishment of the interference strength standard" of our measurement. It is a hardware design with simple principle, easy stitching and wide application range.
The basic principle of this hardware is to apply a fixed intensity interference to the membrane material (biofilm or binding protein/binding domain and its binding matrix), and measure the shedding rate to quantitatively compare the stability of the biofilm or binding strength of the binding protein/binding domain. By adjusting the interference intensity according to the reality, it is theoretically possible to quantitatively measure the stability of all biofilms or the binding strength of the binding protein/binding domain.
In addition, we chose the mixer as the core of the hardware, which can calculate the shear force acting directly on the membrane according to the speed and temperature. This shear force has physical meaning and can be used for modeling or subsequent mechanism exploration.
Therefore, we added the real-time speed, the temperature measurement design, and the real-time calculation of the shear force on the basis of the mixer, making the hardware more convenient and easy to use. The speed regulation module makes it more versatile and meets the criteria for interference with various biofilm strengths. The vertical expansion module of the stirring rod minimizes the influence of the stirring rod on the system before and after mixing, and makes the switching between different experimental groups more convenient and quick.
In order to facilitate other teams to use our measurement system, our hardware adopts modular design, and any module has relatively easy to obtain market-oriented products, thus eliminating the trouble of DIY and customization from scratch.
In addition, the modular design allows it to expand and improve. Other teams can add electronic, and the automation module to make the device more intelligent and convenient.
