Registration and Giant Jamboree Attendance :Register for iGEM, have a great iGEM season, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Competition Deliverables :We have completed the following Competition Deliverables
Wiki, Poster, Presentation, Judging Form.
Attributions: We have completed Competition Deliverable 5-Attributions. We have clearly documented what was done by ourselves and what was done by others. We have classified the categories and clearly listed the general support, project support and adviser, lab support, difficult technique, presentation coaching, Human Practice support and the other teams that help us.
Characterization / Contribution :
(1) We have successfully completed the InterLab Measurement Study and received the E-mail!
(2) We have added new, high quality experimental characterization data to two existing BioBrick Part from the Registry——BBa_K2213003 and BBa_K1807001.
Silver
Validated Part / Validated Contribution: We have clearly registered and submitted 11 parts. We picked BBa_K2789003，BBa_K2789021 and BBa_K2789024 on this judging form, which played a vital role in our project. We documented the data and results in the registry. Actually, all these parts worked well as our expected!
Collaboration: We have significantly worked with lots of teams currently registered 2018 iGEM team(s) in a meaningful way. We joined the 3+net （which is a union composed of many universities and work on the safety of environment track together!）, also we have mentored team SUIS Alpha and team worldshaper Wuhan. Besides, we collaborated with SYSU about the data analysis and a pathway discussing about SDU-China and HZAU-China! We also attended 5th iGEM central china regional conference as well as 5th CCiC!
Human Practices : We have thought carefully and creatively about whether our work is responsible and good for the world. To do a complete chain of Human practices to carefully finish it, we did some HP sets (which concludes input of the real world and out put by our team).
Gold
Integrated Human Practices: We did a very meaningful Human Practices and in our Human Practice page, we have clearly documented how some of the HP determine and greatly improve our design and project!
Improve a Previous Part or Project: CcaS is a very important part in our light control system and we found it in iGEM Parts Registry BBa_K608102. CcaS worked with CcaR to achieve the light-sensing. We have optimized the codons to eliminate the illegal restriction sites to make it meet the RFC10 standards, which allows the standard assembly possible! And we put CcaS and CcaR together to make it a whole functional pathway BBa_K2789001. We verified this part successfully and documented it on the registry. We submitted this part to iGEM hq and this part greatly improve the previous part BBa_K608102!
Model Your Project: Modelling played an important role in our basic design(which control signal to use) and provided us a suggestion on how to further improve it. Besides, We simulated a long-term growth curve of co-culture of bacteria and algae, which helped us to confirm the stability of co-culture and the parameters of growth control of symbiotic biofilm of bacteria and algae!
Demonstration of Your Work: To verify that our system can work, we have verified the different parts separately and combine them to some extent!
1.verify the light control system
 (1).verify the light-induced promoter-CcaS/R system and promoter cpcG
 (2).verify the light promoter+ Not Gate
2.verify the phosphorus accumulation and release protein-PPK,PPX,PPN
 (1).verify the PPK’s function
 (2).verify the PPX+PPN’s function
3. Establish a symbiotic suspension system of algae and bacteria
 (1). Determine the optimal ratio of bacteria to algae
 (2). Determine the optimal conditions for symbiotic culture
4. Establish a means of forming symbiotic biofilm
5. Establish a means to quantitatively measure the stability of biofilm
6. Enhance biofilm stability with three synthetic biological pathways
Finally after an great iGEM season, we verified that they all worked as expected!
