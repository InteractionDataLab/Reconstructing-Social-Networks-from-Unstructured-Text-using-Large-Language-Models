    The energy source of the Ark is the sun. It can maintain the system through photosynthesis and some BOD in the water, and specifically recover some elements in the water body, which not only solves the problem of water pollution, but also reuses the collected elements. If the application is applied on a large scale, the recovered resources will have a status and quantity that cannot be underestimated in the resource cycle.（see our demonstration）
   
   We have cooperated with Huazhong University of Science and Technology this year. They put forward extremely valuable suggestions in the design of the project. We can use the solar energy in the algae symbiosis system, but there are still some places in our ark that need extra energy to drive, such as the rotation of conveyor belts or the input of light as a signal, if we can use photosynthesis to convert light energy into electrical energy, then the Ark can be automated and sustained to a higher extent, and the equivalent of all energy supply is borne by solar energy. And team HUST is doing this year’s idea of using the symbiotic suspension system to generate electricity (Guangenbao gives a link)！ We are very excited and intend to use calculations, modeling and other means to learn from each other in the two projects. The analysis of the place, through this valuable cooperation to make the project more perfect, ideal.

    Our selection of phosphorus in this year's project is just an attempt to apply the Ark to our local problems. We have established an ark system that is not limited to the recovery of phosphorus, as long as the functional part of the loop control path is replaced by a different protein. For example, metal-binding proteins, metal-releasing proteins instead of polyphosphate kinases and endo/exo-polyphosphate enzymes, etc., have developed various arks for different pollution situations for long-term treatment and prevention. of.
The results we have done this year are enough to purify the lake water to solve the problem of water blooms. Proper replacement of the chassis cells allows the Ark to work in the ocean.

   
  &quot;Ark&quot; is a concept that utilizes the symbiosis of the algae membrane as a carrier to recover specific elements from the water by photosynthesis (entropy reduction). The Ark can even be used to directly recover the environmental water, and the sewage can be treated as well. Because it does not need to float in a body of water, its form can change, but all synthetic biology pathways remain unchanged.

    Using the ability to transport substances, even microscopic operations can be performed

    The current scope of work of the Ark is limited to water. If the chassis cells are upgraded or the pathway is upgraded, and a suitable functional part of the protein is sought, it is also worthwhile to recover specific elements in the atmosphere.
