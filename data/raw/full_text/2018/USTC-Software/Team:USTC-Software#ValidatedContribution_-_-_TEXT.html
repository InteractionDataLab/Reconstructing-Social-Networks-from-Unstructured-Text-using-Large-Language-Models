Edit A New Report
This online editor is a good way to recording your experiment. Once finishing reading this brief guide, you will know how fast and how easy we can achieve this goal.
We divide an experiment report into three parts: Info, Protocols and Result
Here is the appearance of our editor and it initials an empty report when the editor button on the top is clicked:
In the Info block, you can input title, labels and abstract like this:
The left sider is a toolbox that contains Protocols and steps. You can see there are some several steps and protocol that is created for you, you can create more steps and protocols as you wish.
Now let's click a Add step to see what will happen.
A new Centifuge Step is inserted into the report. The only thing you need to do is to fill some blanks. That is how you record a '12000 rpm centifuge for 30 s at 25 degree.'. Is that amazing? But we can make it much more faster.
protocol is a set of steps or a template. Let's try Gel Extraction.
A serial of steps is inserted into your report and most of these blanks is accomplished by our templates.
It is true that the available steps and protocol are not able to meet all your demands. But you can create new steps and protocol. Here is an example:
A new step called Add something into burette is created in the step bar and you can insert it into your report.
Environment Variable is another way to help you to accomplish your writing.Click the VAR button and define some variables.
In that way, the editor will replace all @v1 pattern  into 30 and @v2 pattern into PCR in the report.
The third section of a report is results. In this section, it is free to insert some texts, pictures, lists and tables to record the results.
Click these buttons on the right side of editor to insert them into your report.
If you can not find those buttons, click the little blue cat button.
After finishing editing, click the Save button to save it and preview button to have a look of your work.
You can see all sentences are produced automatically. Click Export button to download your work in PDF.
Intelligent Search Engine
Our Search Engine is much more intelligent and useful than Biohub 2.0.
It not only supports searching Users or Articles, but alse supports customize filter and sort rules in natural language. It means we support the sentenses like 'reports by Jiyan in this year' or 'reports with label PCR'. It is gorgeous and easy to use.
We support a integration search that connected to more than 50 websites like NLM, PubMed, PMC and so on.
Bio-bricks is the traditional function in Biohub 2.0, and it will be supported in the long term. BLAST is useful to search gene segment like AGGT'
Society
You can see the details of all reports and leave a comment or like the report. In that way, the author will receive the feeds.
In that way,we build a scientific society where academic discussion is possible.
