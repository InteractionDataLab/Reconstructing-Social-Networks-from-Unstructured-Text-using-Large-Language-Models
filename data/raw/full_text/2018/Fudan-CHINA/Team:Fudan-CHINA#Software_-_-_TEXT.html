"There are 10 kinds of persons, one knows binary and the other does not know."
Overview
Our software consists of several parts.
For the model, we developed a website Graphical User Interface named VisualSTEP that allows the user to adjust the parameters autonomously and it can display the simulation results of the model in real time. This can help others understand our model in depth and freely explore how our STEP system works.
For general biological experiments, we developed a user-friendly biological parameter calculator, which can be applied in several kinds of biology reactions, to minimize the burden of life science researchers calculating parameters before carrying out experiments. These calculators have been used in our wet lab and some experiments done by some third-party users for a while, and have gained a good reputation.
VisualSTEP
We obtained several conclusions which are closely related to the results of wet lab and can provide guidance for future experiments from our model, in which the effect of protease cleavage ability on dynamic range may be the most difficult part to understand. Hence, we develop the software VisualSTEP, now begin your own exploration!   You can adjust the parameters p1, p2 ,d1, d2 in our birth-death process model to find the effect of them on dynamic range. In general, p1>p2>0, d1>d2>0. Hence, the dynamic range is negatively correlated with protease cleavage ability.
