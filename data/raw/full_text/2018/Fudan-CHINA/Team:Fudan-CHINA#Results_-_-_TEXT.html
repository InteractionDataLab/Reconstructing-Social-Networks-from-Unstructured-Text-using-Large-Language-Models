Results Overview
"No road of flowers lead to glory."
To develop and optimise our STEP system to achieve the goal of efficient tumour marker recognition, we set out to test the whole system in human cell lines, and at the same time combine computational design and wet lab experiment to optimise existing receptors.
We successfully proved that the STEP receptors can appropriately locate across the cell membrane, and that they are able to bind to activate the downstream receptor when target ligand is added.
