PIE CRUST
Ingredients
2 ½  cups unbleached all-purpose flour (12 ½ ounces)
1  teaspoon table salt
2  tablespoons sugar
12  tablespoons cold unsalted butter (1 ½ sticks), cut into ¼-inch slices
½  cup chilled solid vegetable shortening, cut into 4 pieces
1  handle vodka, cold
¼  cup cold water
ice
lime juice
fresh mint
ginger beer
Preparation
Process 1 ½ cups flour, salt, and sugar in food processor until combined, about 2 one-second pulses. Add butter and shortening and process until homogeneous dough just starts to collect in uneven clumps, about 15 seconds (dough will resemble cottage-cheese curds, and there should be no uncoated flour). Scrape bowl with rubber spatula and redistribute dough evenly around processor blade. Add remaining cup flour and pulse until mixture is evenly distributed around bowl and mass of dough has been broken up, 4 to 6 quick pulses. Empty mixture into medium bowl.
Sprinkle ¼ cup vodka and water over mixture. With rubber spatula, use folding motion to mix, pressing down on dough until dough is slightly tacky and sticks together. Divide dough into two even balls and flatten each into 4-inch disk. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 45 minutes or up to 2 days.
Blend lime juice, ice, mint, and the remaining vodka. Fill glasses with equal parts blended mixture and ginger beer. Drink.
Once dough has chilled, unwrap it and place between two large sheets of plastic wrap.
PIE FILLINGS
PEACH
Slice enough peaches to fill a pie pan. Toss with sugar, lemon juice, and cinnammon.
APPLE
Slice enough apples to fill a pie pan. Saute with butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon until tender but not soft.
CHERRY
Pit enough cherries to fill a pie pan. Toss with sugar.
PIE BAKING
Blind bake for 20 minutes at 350 degrees with pie weights, beans, or clean coins. Add filling and top crust and bake for another 30-40 minutes, or until filling bubbles and crust is golden.
