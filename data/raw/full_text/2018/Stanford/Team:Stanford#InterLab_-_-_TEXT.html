INTRODUCTION
Reliability and reproducibility are critical for successfully executing synthetic biology. Nevertheless, differences in measurements between labs persist. The Fifth International InterLab Study continues the work of prior InterLab studies and seeks to establish an effective and reproducible measurement procedure for GFP, thereby reducing variability between labs. This year’s InterLab explores whether normalizing to colony forming units (CFUs) reduces variability between labs relative to normalizing to optical density.
