Before we began, we only had general knowledge of  hydroponics, and a limited understanding of oxidative stress damage and benefits. These topics, however, are fundamental to how Oxyponics works and how it will be applied. We knew we needed to understand the intricacies of the problem, the industry we were trying to break into, the needs and wants of the end users, the science behind the design, the environmental impact of our system, and the communities that would be affected by advances in hydroponics.

Interviews in each category were conducted with interwoven timelines that spanned the development of our project. This method let us organically gain insights about a large range of aspects relevant to OxyPonics, and led us to see how far-reaching our project was, even beyond just improving plant growth. We gained a sense of how our Oxyponics would fit into the larger industry and how our biocircuit could have further applications. The learnings from all of our research and interviews were put together like puzzle pieces to make informed decisions regarding product development and to envision product impacts.

Professor Aye was excited about our use of the redox sensitive fluorescent protein. She affirmed the novelty of our idea to couple this fusion protein to graded response against ROS, and acknowledged that it would pave the way to creating more robust biological circuits in cells by being able to control damage caused by oxidative stress.  Professor Aye also commented on potential obstacles that we might encounter, and pushed us to think about the number of parts our plan would require. Her insight and support led us to understand how our ROS-regulating biocircuit could be used as a tool in further synthetic biology advances. Additionally, we identified a need for heightened protection against ROS, which was taken into consideration when designing and assembling the biobricks we decided upon.

Professor Martin researches the effect of ROS and disease in plants. With respect to oxidative species, Martin stressed the importance of ROS in the first and secondary lines of immune defense in plants. We learned that we needed to carefully control how much native ROS we quench in the plant, as quenching too much could make them more susceptible to disease. This idea was integrated into the biological circuit we developed. Instead of only lowering ROS levels, by having antioxidant product coupled to a light sensitive promoter we could also turn expression off to maintain a minimum level of oxidative stress.

We reached out to Dr. Maria Harrison, an adjunct professor in the School of Integrative Plant Science, conducting research on the mechanisms underlying symbiosis between plants and fungal symbionts. By understanding how fungi interacted with plants, we were hoping to understand how E. coli might interact with our plants. We learned that there would be a big hurdle to having our E. coli survive with the plants: E. coli were optimized for the gut, while fungi have co-evolved with plants. This fed into the design decision to have our E. coli contained within dialysis tubing and put close proximity to the plants rather than in direct contact with them.

We spoke to Dr. Tim Setter, a professor and the chair of the section of soil and crop science. He studies the mechanisms of drought stress response in plants. While drought is not a problem in hydroponics, flooding is. The major consequence of flooding is reduced oxygen levels around the roots, thus leading to an oxidative stress response. He informed us that oxidants may leak out from the plant roots if there is high enough stress, which informed our decision to place the bacteria around the roots of the plants.

For this reason, we met with Dr. Jed Sparks of the Department of Evolution and Ecological Biology, He told us that soils and the environment in general are usually very effective at quenching exogenous ROS, but this advantage disappears in a hydroponic setting, where the roots of the plant are no longer in soil, but in an aqueous solution. This showed us that quantifying and responding to ROS may be beneficial to the health of the plants. However, optimization is necessary to prevent interference with plant metabolic and signaling pathways that involve ROS. Once again, this led to our decision to have antioxidant expression controlled by a light sensitive promoter that could be activated or deactivated on demand to maintain a certain level of ROS.

Through these professors we not only gained effective understanding of plant physiology but also built upon the literature we had read to gain background on oxidative stress’ effects on plants. Moreover, experts who focused specifically on hydroponic systems, helped us gain a new perspective on common problems at hydroponic farms.

We realized that our system needed to be affordable as well as effective in increasing yields. From a technical standpoint, Dr. Mattson also helped us design our testing protocol by suggesting we use basil, a relatively easy crop to grow hydroponically that is becoming more and more widespread.

She spoke to us about the special role reactive oxygen species (ROS) play in plant growth, including their roles in cell differentiation and maturation. She was excited about our project, as her own research had shown that using intracellular expression of oxidative enzymes such as catalase could help reduce oxidative stress for plant and increase blooming in plants exposed to external high levels of ROS. She expressed that there was potential that our regulation of ROS via OxyPonics could be an innovative approach to promoting plant health.

She thought that teaching students about sustainability through the installation and upkeep of a hydroponic system at the university would not only be a valuable learning experience in sustainability but also provide an introduction into a growing practice for more controlled food production. She explained to us how here set-up worked, and how Ithaca College’s cafeteria actively used the herbs produced hydroponically in meals for students. To monitor the hydroponic s a variety of factors are checked, including pH, water quality, and conductivity. However, oxidative stress is not taken into account, meaning OxyPonics would be a novel implementation.

She said if our product could increase profit margins, it would help the hydroponic industry grow. Since OxyPonics would increase plant yield, we believe there is tangible need for our product. Additionally, OyxPonics would need to priced affordably. We addressed this issue by instead of creating an entirely new hydroponic set-up, creating components such as a rail system and dialysis rings that could be adapted and and installed into existing hydroponic set-ups.</P><P>Next, a point Dr. Turkon made clear is that personally she did not have much of a technical background and many she knew in the hydroponic industry were the same.

As we toured his greenhouse experiments where he had his own hydroponic set-ups, he excitedly told us that “most of where interesting science happens is at the interface of different sciences,” referring to how we were combining synthetic biology with plant sciences - two fields which typically do not interact in academia. Dr. Pineros area of expertise is in abiotic stresses and ROS production. He suggested we study root biology in hydroponics and measure the ROS production in treated vs. untreated plants for our testing. Furthermore, he gave us important feedback on containment: he suggested we use some sort of filter to contain the flow of nutrients in one direction and keep the bacteria separate from the plants. This manifested in the dialysis tubing we used to contain our bacteria. Moreover, his hydroponic set-up gave us some in-person contact with the type of system we wanted OxyPonics to be utilized for. This helped us understand firsthand what might work in such an environment, to build on the recommendations and suggestions provided through grower interviews.

Dr. Roeder suggested we reach out to Dr. Benfey in Duke’s Department of Biology, who helped us learn about roots and ROS in root systems. He mentioned that our project was venturing into little-researched territory, and that the results could have important results on hydroponic crop growth. He also discussed some of the potential effects of ROS on root development. For example, reducing hydrogen peroxide levels leads to more rapid root growth in some plants, as well as distribution of superoxide and peroxide in the plant root tip and elongation cells. Dr. Benfey further mentioned some of the precautions we would need to take if we wanted proper plant development, namely if the bacteria need to be in a symbiotic relationship with the root and if it is possible to gauge the internal redox environment of the plant from the outside.

We have asked Dr. Hong for insight on how to set up a system ourselves. The set-up they used was a gel box with foam stabilizing blocks for arabidopsis as a model organism. Ultimately, we decided our system would be better suited for larger plants such as leafy greens. However, the visit was still valuable as we learned about what needs to be monitored in a hydroponic system, such as pH and nutrient levels. Dr. Hong also provided us with a sample nutrient solution mix for a hydroponic system. This information was important since the environment which both plants and E. coli are exposed to in a hydroponic system is critical to the successful operation of the Oxyponics.

She responded positively and said they could easily be installed in a hydroponic system as we intended. With us we bought a 3D printed prototype of the the crop planter that would hold the bacteria-containing dialysis tubing near a plant’s roots for ROS detection. Dr. Turkon provided us valuable feedback about making the planter cup’s rings slightly smaller and having more supports incorporated to have more stability with growing seedlings.

We wanted to learn about the use of microbes in farming, since ultimately that is what we would like to do. They do not face any additional legal regulation since their bacteria are sourced from the soil and not transgenic. In order to keep their bacteria alive, Terrapin uses molasses instead of traditional nutrient solutions containing salts and citric acid. The molasses not only provides a source of sugar for the bacteria, but also helps control the pH of the solution. We discovered that people do not seem to have a problem with the microbes because soil farming also has bacteria.

We hoped to learn about the problems that plagued hydroponics in earlier days. Red Acres faced several issues with their lettuce growth: they were unaware that the lettuce would be smaller and take longer to grow during the winter. On the other spectrum, very hot days cause bolting in the lettuce, which makes it bitter. Tip burn, where the leaves of a plant decay due to calcium deficiency or rapid growth, can also happen year-round. In order to combat these issues, they use automated systems and computers to regulate their plants.

Aerofarms is one of the few farms that grows their plants by constantly misting the crops’ roots. This technique, known as aeroponics, is done with a large number of machines that allow for a tremendous density of produce.  We hoped to discover any differences between aeroponic techniques and deep water hydroponic techniques.  A big problem for them is employee discipline since mental rigor is required to repeat similar tasks, maintain conditions, and watch everything carefully. They also lack the equipment necessary to spot disease early on.

PureSpinach was initially a Cornell startup which led us to them. In order to combat pythium, a form of fungal infection, they use lower water temperatures in their growth tanks. We encountered and talked to Serdar, CEO of PureSpinach, who gave us insight on farming and monitoring of his products. He was especially concerned with the temperature of his system, which needs to be carefully regulated in order to keep the spinach growing. He also emphasized the necessity for large-scale testing to ensure the validity of our findings.

Vertical Harvest recently rolled out the 4th generation of their product, a hydroponic farm in a box, geared towards northern climates. We spoke to Cameron Willingham, the founder of Vertical Harvest, who provided us with insight on the business aspect of hydroponics and the technical aspect of building a reliable, low maintenance hydroponics system. Specifically, they wanted to make their designs simple, hardy, and robust to ensure self sufficiency and versatility of their hydroponic systems.Their products and comments reminded us that our product needed a sleek and hassle-free profile. This was a big emphasis as we designed our user interface, where we incorporated graphs and visually uncluttered representations of the analytics from the hydroponic farm, but also longer in depth reports if more analysis was desired.

We talked Kohlie Frantzen, who told us that they invest substantial time into creating standardized farming training using ideas from oil drilling sites. They also have invented a greenhouse that can be easily deployed in all climates and work as the village’s or town’s hub. They operate with the big theme of local sourced food. We hoped to learn which components of hydroponic farming are crucial to a successful setup and what techniques they found worthy of monitoring and standardizing. Helical Outpost's biggest concern is ensuring that the electrical components of their green houses do not fail and waste a full cycle of crops. They informed us that a way to see live data from hydroponic tanks would be extremely valuable.

We hoped AmHydro could evaluate how marketable of a product OxyPonics is and whether or not OxyPonics would gain traction in the hydroponic community. Joe gave us insight on both the farming and technical aspects of hydroponics. We discovered that customers decide to upgrade their systems usually when there is a large return value, even with high initial costs. Currently, Amhydro is working on a way to effectively and easily keep track of data from crops using software. This would make growers' lives easier, since they need expensive documentation and certifications in order to produce food.Our software therefore provides longer term records of hydroponic conditions over time, in addition to real-time analytics.

We gained insight about the potential hydroponics has to meet the produce demands of large cities. According to research done by Columbia University’s Urban Design Lab, urban agriculture in cities not only address questions of food security, but also encourages social development, public health, and environmental education [1].

We learned about citywide initiatives such as New York City’s “Grow to Learn” program in the schools, which uses the garden and the greenhouse as the classroom. Mr. Hislop told us this education program encompassed a variety of hands on skills, such as urban agriculture, rainwater harvesting, composting, pest control pests without using chemicals and pesticides, and mulching. The program puts a large emphasis on reducing and reusing with its partnership with the Climate Justice Organization. It gives students the opportunity to take up extensive service projects in improving the gardens while also providing teachers and parents workshops and trainings in the field of environmental education.</P><P>Mr. Hislop also mentioned that gardens with hydroponics are increasingly popular, and that they provide educators who lack green spaces and land to grow produce conventionally with a portable hydroponic gardening classroom. This take on bigger picture of environmental education gave us much to think about with respect to hydroponics and our project.

Unlike lectures, these situations have a “learn as you go” atmosphere. Community and school gardens in the cities therefore offer an “incredibly rich learning experience,” especially to underserved and low income urban areas. Professor Krasny gave us a unique take on this “formal, but informal” education that also has the potential to combine culture, science, and community engagement. Community farms allow students to connect with the culture capital of a neighborhood, for example with farming traditions and knowledge of elders and immigrants.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="no-padding-bottom"><DIV class="content-title no-subtitle">REFERENCES</DIV><OL class="references"><LI>Ackerman, K.
