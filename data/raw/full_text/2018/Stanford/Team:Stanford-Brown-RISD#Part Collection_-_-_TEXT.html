Stanford-Brown-RISD Best Parts Collection
Chitin is ubiquitous in nature in organisms ranging from fungi to insects - in fact, it’s the second most abundant biopolymer on earth. Methods to take advantage of this fact using synthetic biology are limited - we established a part collection using chitin binding domains as a novel platform to functionalize chitin-containing surfaces, with almost unlimited potential for modifying regions of organisms. We demonstrated the utility through designing novel biological cross-linking glues, fluorescent dyes, and filtration tools. We then used Isothermal Titration Calorimetry, strength testing, and various other quantitative methods to conclusively prove the mechanism of action and the ability of this collection to be used for novel applications. We’ve also filed a patent disclosure and are moving forward with further refinement or our framework. The part numbers range from BBa_K2868011 to BBa_K2868028, but not all parts in that range are included in the collection. Our collection forms an important pipeline for future teams and the global scientific community for a wide array of applications ranging from water purification to bioglue production.
