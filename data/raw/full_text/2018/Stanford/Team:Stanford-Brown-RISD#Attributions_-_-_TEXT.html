We are so appreciative and thankful for all the individuals that made our iGEM Team and Project successful! Thank you to Lynn Rothschild, Jim Head, Gary Wessel, Nils Averesch, Tomasz Zajkowski, Jesica Urbina, Trevor! Kalkus, Rolando Perez, and Christopher Maurer.
Our team had online brainstorming & team meetings beginning in March 2018, where we stitched together rough subprojects and the overall theme. Our work in the lab did not start until June 2018, when the Brown & RISD students ended their spring semester and travelled to California. Stanford students got to lab after finishing their spring quarter in late June. All projects were begun by the Brown students, and ended by the Stanford students as the Jamboree approached.
