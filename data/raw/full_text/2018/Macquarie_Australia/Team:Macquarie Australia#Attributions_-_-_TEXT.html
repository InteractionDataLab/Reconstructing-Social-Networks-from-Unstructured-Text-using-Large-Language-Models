Project and lab support
Dr Louise Brown
Organised and recruited the iGEM 2018 team at Macquarie. Handled our budgeting for the team, organised many sponsorship opportunities and steered us in the right direction during our project.
Professor Robert Willows
Designed all the individual parts for our project and assisted us in complex laboratory techniques. Was an invaluable resource for any knowledge we required on all things related to our project, gave assistance in the modelling of our project and came up with our human practices idea.
Dr Edward Moh
Provided supervision and advisement to the team in the lab. Also provided helpful motivation to complete our project, and answered any questions we had on laboratory techniques or scientific concepts.
Dr Paul Jaschke
Met with the human practices team to explain the framework to customer discovery and assisted in general support throughout our project.
Mike Gibbs
Ran the iGEM boot camp getting us on track for success and supervised lab work, answering any questions we had while providing emotional support during stressful periods in the lab.
Thi Huynh
Gave constant support and laboratory resources while supervising and giving up her time for our team. Without her guidance our project would have been impossible.
Dominic Logel
Helped to oversee our team to guide us to the finish line in Boston with his firsthand experience of the iGEM competition.
Mark Tran
One of our lab supervisors, he inducted the team during our bootcamp so we could work on our own.

General support
We would like to thank the many members of the scientific community that have given us guidance, feedback and advice through our human practices initiative. The troubleshooting suggestions offered by these people have also been integrated into our project to ensure it is a useful tool that can be successfully implemented to make a change in the world.
Special mentions must be given to Mr Anthony Gurlica, who gave us an insight into his role as a mediator between chemistry and biology and Dr Briardo Llorente, who helped us troubleshoot our project and offered valuable feedback. Special mentions must also be given to Dr Jenny Vo, who provided us with an industry perspective, A/Prof Anwar Sunna, who provided us with a list of valuable contacts to interview and Dr Brendan Orner, who provided constructive feedback which has been integrated into our human practices.
