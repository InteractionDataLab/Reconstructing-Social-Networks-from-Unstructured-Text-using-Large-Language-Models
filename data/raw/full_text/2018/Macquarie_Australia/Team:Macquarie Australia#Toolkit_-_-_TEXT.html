Overview
In order to create this tool kit, iGEM Macquarie have conducted our own research. This involved deepening the understanding of our  project by performing interviews and obtaining feedback from academics and industry experts. We interviewed people who work in similar lines of research that our product fell into and that could potentially be impacted by it. We also conducted surveys to investigate how other iGEM teams were coping with human practices. Along the way, we created several hypotheses and set out to test them through interviewing professionals. The drive behind developing this toolkit was primarily influenced by our findings that many iGEM teams struggle to either go about implementing human practices or integrating what they find into their project. We believe our toolkit will assist teams in the process of integrating human practice into iGEM projects well into the future.
