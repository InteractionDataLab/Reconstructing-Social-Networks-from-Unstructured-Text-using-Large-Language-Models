Gel Preparation
Mix 1g of agarose powder with 100ml of 1x TAE buffer and heat for 1 minute or until all agarose is dissolved.
Wait until it has cooled (not set), and add 1ul of GelRed into the mixture.
Pour the solution into a cast with an appropriate comb.
Leave to set.
Running the Gel
Mix 1ul of 1kbp DNA ladder with 6ul of loading dye (bromophenol blue) and 4ul of 1 x TAE buffer (total 6ul) and load onto first well.
Mix 5ul of PCR products with 1ul of loading dye and load into wells.
Run gel at 90V products with 1ul of loading dye and load onto wells.
Run gel at 90V for 45 minutes approximately.
Photograph gels under UV light.
Manual Trypsin Digest
For Coomassie stained gels, de-stain gels by washing briefly with 200uL NH4HCO3 (Solution A) to make sure gel pieces are at the correct pH.
Add 200uL 50% acetonitrile / 50% 100mM NH4HCO3 (Solution B) into each well. Vortex to mix and incubate for 10 minutes. Remove liquid.
Repeat step 2. Gel pieces should be clear at this stage. If they are still blue, repeat as necessary until colour is gone.
Wash for 5 min with 50uL of 100% acetonitrile (Solution C) to dehydrate gel pieces. Vortex during incubation.
Remove acetonitrile, then let air-dry for 10 min. The gel pieces should be noticeably shrunken and probably white.
Reduction and Alkylation: Cover gel pieces with 50uL 10mM DTT in 50mM NH4HCO3 (Solution D). Let proteins be reduced for 45-60 min in a 37oC incubator.
Remove DTT solution and add 50uL of 55mM iodoacetamide in 50mM NH4HCO3 (Solution E). Incubate for 45 min in dark place at room temperature.
Remove iodoacetamide, discard.
Wash gel pieces with 200uL of NH4HCO3 (Solution A) for 5 min with vortexing before adding 100uL of 100% acetonitrile (Solution C).
Remove liquid after 5 min, discard.
Wash gel pieces with 50uL 100mM NH4HCO3 (Solution A) for 10 min, then twice with 200uL 50% acetonitrile / 50% 100mM NH4HCO3 (Solution B) for 10min.
Dehydrate with 100 uL 100% acetonitrile (Solution C) for 5 min as above.
Remove remaining liquid and let the gel dry.
Trypsin Digestion: Prepare trypsin mix to final concentration of 13ng/uL in 50mM Ammonium bicarbonate. Add 30uL (or more if required) of mixed trypsin solution to cover the gel pieces. Allow 30 min for gel rehydration at 4oC (on ice). Digest overnight at 37oC.
Peptide Extraction
Transfer the digest solution supernatant (if any) into clean 0.65ml Eppendorf tubes.
To the gel pieces, add 50 uL of 50% acetonitrile / 2% formic acid, incubate 30 min. Spin, remove supernatant and combine with initial digest solution supernatant. Please note that total volume may vary depending on the gel sizes.
Vortex the extracted digests, speed vac to reduce volume to 10 uL. If the remaining volume is less than 10uL, use 2% formic acid to bring the volume up to 10 uL.
Spin at 14,000 rpm for 30 min to remove any micro particulates.
Transfer the supernatant to a fresh 0.65ml eppendorf tube for storage at 4oC fridge OR directly into PCR plate for Mass spec for analysis.
Trypsin Preparation
Trypsin is prepared by adding 200uL of Resuspension Buffer into one vial containing 20ug of Proteomics grade trypsin.
Add 1.2ml of 50mM NH4HCO3 into each trypsin vial (final concentration of Trypsin is 16ng/uL). Mix thoroughly.
This will provide enough Trypsin for 46 digestions.

Protochlorophyllide Extraction from Barley
Etiolated barley was prepared by growing the seeds for 8-9 days after germination in the dark.
The stalks of the Yellow sprouts were collected and macerated with liquid nitrogen and soaked in ~600mL acetone for 10 minutes.
The sample was then filtered using filter paper to remove the plant solids and washed with acetone several times or until no more colored pigment is extracted, followed by a final wash with ~400mL  of diethyl ether.
The solution was then transferred to a separatory funnel and shaken vigorously.
The lower now colourless aqueous phase was drained and discarded whilst the organic phase was washed several times with roughly 30°C water to remove traces of acetone.
Redistilled light petroleum (b.p.40-60°C) was then added to the ether followed by approx. 10% the volume of the organic layer of methanol/ 0.01 M-NH3 (4:1v/v).
The solution was left to evaporate until it separated into clearly defined phases.
The two phases were separated and the presence of pigments in only the bottom methanol phase was confirmed by fluorescence of solution under uv light.
The sample was then collected and stored in methanol at -20°C.
