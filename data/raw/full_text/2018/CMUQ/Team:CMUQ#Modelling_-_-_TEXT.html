Designing sgRNA with E-CRISP and CHOP-CHOP: Testing on mutation HBB 1 :
>gnl|dbSNP|rs33946267|allelePos=251|totalLen=501|taxid=9606|snpclass=1|alleles='A/C/G/T'|mol=Genomic|build=151
E- Score = 10 (Efficacy) S- Score = -2 (Specificity)
E score detail:
GC content and Polyt information. GC contentï¼š0.8 the GC content of the sgRNA is 0.8. Polyt: No there is no TTTT in sgRNA.
CRISPR-ERA computes efficacy score (E) and specificity penalty score (S) for each sgRNA according to off-target, location, GC content, poly-T sequence, etc. Both E and S start with 0, and accumulate with the criteria listed in tables below:
