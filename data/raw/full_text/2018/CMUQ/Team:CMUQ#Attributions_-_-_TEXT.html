Dr. Anette Vincent: co-Advisor
Dr. Vincent obtained her BSc and PhD degrees in Biochemistry from the National University of Singapore and is currently an Assistant Teaching Professor and Program Director of the Biological Sciences program at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar. Being a true blue Singaporean, she enjoys eating and cooking. If there was time for sports, football and netball are the sports of choice. Her scientific research focuses on the isolation and characterization of bacteriophages as an alternative to biocides/ antibiotics to combat pathogenic bacteria in the environment. Her group isolates undiscovered bacteriophages from the environment (sand, soil, wastewater) and purify these viruses against host bacterial species related to disease causing or bioremediation associated species. Through the use of next-generation sequencing techniques and computational biology tools, her group aims to elucidate the microbiome and bacteriophages from the environment.
Cheryl Telmer: co-Advisor
Major: Biological Sciences
As a Research Biologist at Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh we are developing fluorescent and bioluminescent sensors for live-cell imaging of protein localization and dynamics of cell structure and function. Collaborative research projects with Dr. Miskov-Zivanov and her lab at the University of Pittsburgh, as part of DARPA's Big Mechanism program,are directed towards the design of a system for automated reading of scientific literature and assembly of causal, explanatory models of the dynamics of signaling pathways in cancer.
Selma Limam Mansar
Many thanks to the Associate Dean of Education at CMUQ for her continuous support, she's the reason why CMUQ's team was able to fly fly all the way to Boston!
Saquib Razak
We would like to thank Professor Saquib for his guidance in assembling our hardware device.
Savitha Shantaraj
We would like to thank Savitha for handling the travel arrangements of the CMUQ team.
Maya Kemaldean
We would like to thank Maya for her help in pre-lab preparations, her supervision during lab work, her guidance when dealing with new techniques and protocols and her overall support throughout the project
Bernadette Bernales
We would like to thank Bernadette for her help in pre-lab preparations, her supervision during lab work, and her great emotional support!
Angela Ford
Angela Ford is a writer and editor with a specialty in marketing and public relations. She is the person behind our iGEM story on Carnegie Mellon’s website! Link
Stephen MacNeil
Steve is a Web Manager / Senior Multimedia Designer. Steve spent hours taking the perfect pictures for our wiki, from lab work and meetings to team members portraits.
Boas Pucker
Boas Pucker is our iGEM mentor. We used Slack and Skype to communicate regularly for questions and clarifications on the deliverables, our progress and troubleshooting.
Megan Hochstrasser
Ph.D.
Megan has a B.A. in Biology from Brown University and received her Ph.D. from Jennifer Doudna’s lab at UC Berkeley in 2016, where she studied mechanisms of CRISPR immunity in bacteria. She joined the IGI in September 2016 to handle scientific communications. she connected us to our Cas12a expert mentor: Kyle Watters! https://innovativegenomics.org/overview/staff/
Najlaa Althani, Albandari Alkhater and Aisha Fakhro
CMUQ and former iGEM team members. The three former iGEM 2017 team members took some of their precious time to help us in our lab work!
We Would like to thank our sponsors
