What isour model going to achieve?
“Our model should focus on the following points:
Binding/dissociation of Cas12a protein with DNA.
Activity of gRNA in complex with Cas12a bound to DNA.
Anything to do with molecular signal? Does it affect gRNA activity/ Cas12a activity?”
How would iGEM CMUQ team collaborate and benefit the TecCEM team ?
We would characterize their plasmid. The plasmids sent would already be cloned in the backbone of pSB1C3. We would have to transform the pSB1C3 plasmids in E. coli strains and characterize the protein expressed. The TecCEM team would provide us with the size of the proteins. The type of column that would be used in the characterization would be Ni column (if available). The team would send their linearized plasmids to CMU-P then CMU-P would send the linearized plasmids to  CMU-Q. This would hopefully shorten the time taken for the plasmids to arrive.
How can TecCEM team benefit iGEM CMUQ team ?
Saliva samples from the local people would be sent and analyzed using the fluorescent device. In the project description,  “In middle eastern populations many carriers are unaware of the mutations that they can pass on to their children and the risk that their offspring are born with the disease.” . TecCEM team can help us test different ethics and populations of the world by sending saliva samples from Mexican people that are carriers of the disease.
TecCEM team would characterize the Cas12 protein. We would send the sequence cloned in pSB31C plasmid to them and they would characterize the Cas12 protein.
