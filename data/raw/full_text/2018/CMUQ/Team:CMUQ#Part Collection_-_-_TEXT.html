The transformed cells (DH5α by Dr. MB lab) did not grow. The positive and negative control did not have any cells grown. The cell DNA control was re-done and spread on LB plates rather than LB-Chl plates. This was one mistake done: incubate cell control DNA in LB-Chl plates. The protocol done today was to add 50μL of competent cells only and proceed to steps 12, 14-16 (no heat shock, ect).

Cell Control was successful, transformed cells from Monday still didn't show any colonies.

The DNA samples (from kit plate 7, including positive and negative control) were transformed.
The competency test for the One shot- ultra component cells provided by Dr Vincent worked successfully.
Monday 2 July
Interlab
Sakina, Sondoss
Inoculated the transfomed samples (test samples 1-6, positive and negative controls).
Below are picture of the transformed samples. The cell control was used as the negative control (as only cells were spread and these cells had no Chl resistance). The difference between the positive and negative control was the fluorescence and color of the colonies. The hypothesis is that the negative control would not emit fluorescence while the positive control would. This can only be confirmed after taking fluorescence readings.

Run agarose gel electrophoresis to pSB1C3  (BBa_J04450) to check size (estimated size = 3.1 kb).
RESULTS:
We used the pSB1C3 plasmid provided in kit plate 7 (BBa_J04450) which has a reporter protein (RFP) but we don't want the fluorescence as we are using our own FP, therefore we need to transform the one in the linearized plasmid kit and perform digest and gel.

Dina
Preform a PCR reaction on the Dsp-T7 fragment
changed annealing temp from 58˚C to 54˚C
changed annealing time from 15 sec to 30 sec
Run an agarose gel electrophoresis of Dsp-T7 fragment PCR (expected size= 1.232 Kb).

Transform DH5α cells with the pSB1C3 plasmid (the plasmid was obtained from the small iGEM grey box and it is the linearized plasmid with no fluorescent proteins).
Thursday 26 July
Preparation
Sakina,Sondoss
If PCR of Dsp-T7 was successful → PCR cleanup, Restriction digest with EcoRI and PstI
If PCR of Dsp-T7 was unsuccessful → troubleshoot and repeat PCR + gel
Check plates of the transformed DH5α cells with the linearized pSB1C3 plasmid and proceed with overnight culture if successful.
Results
Transformation of linearized pSB1C3 backbone (found in small iGEM grey box with no fluorescnet proteins) in DH5-α cells. The colonies showed red colour which means it has the fluorescence proteins
The PCR of Dsp-T7 after changing the conditions failed. In the 1st lane is the 1kb and the PCR product is supposed to show in the 3rd lane.

Inoculate the transformed colonies into duplicates (2 colonies inoculated in 5mL of LB-Chl media each).
Nanodrop the gBlocks DNA sample to know the DNA concentration.
Trouble-shoot the PCR and preform a PCR reaction on the Dsp-T7 fragment:

Advised us about outreach and human practices
Elaborated on the validation process and the proof of concept where we must ensure and try that everything is working"as expected" (eg: DNA well purified for use withe the right concentration) & Shed light on the fact we need an approval from the ministry of ethics if we are to collect saliva samples from patients.
Emphasized that sequences must be submitted in DNA form (make a corresponding sequence of the RNA and submit it)
Cheap Assays are preferred by iGEM .

Gel extraction
Nanodropped the digested DNA fragments extracted from the gel: pSB1C3: 15.2 ng/µL, Dsp: 1.3 ng/µL
Results
Successful digests for both the Dsp and pSB1C3, correct band sizes were observed. The bands extracted were the Dsp band and 2.0 kb band in the pSB1C3 backbone.
Gel extraction pictures and gels:
The mass of microcentrifuge was tared and subtracted from the sample+microcentrifuge mass. The masses recorded were the masses of the gel extracted: Dsp band:
Mass of Dsp: 0.5229 grams
Mass (ng): 21 (as expected from the gel ladder bands)
Expected size (kb): 1.213
Observed size (kb): 1.2
Mass of pSB1C3 backbone: 0.2018 grams.
Mass (ng): 1 band was 250 ng and the other band was 375ng (as expected from the gel ladder bands)
Expected size (kb): 1.11 kb and 2.029 kb
Observed size (kb): 1.2 kb and 2.0 kb
The gel bands extracted were the Dsp band size 1.2 kb and the 2.0 kb pSB1C3 backbone using the Gel Extraction protocol.
Volume of QX1 added for pSB1C3 was: 600 μL as 3 folds more so mass=200 mg so 200*3=600
Volume of QX1 added for Dsp was: 1.5 mL as  folds so mass=500 mg so 500*3=1500
Results
A very faint band of size of ≈ 3 kb which is the band of interest was observed, along with other bands. This band is most likely the band of interest as it corresponds to expected ligated product of size 3.2 kb.

Gel extraction pictures and gels:
The mass of microcentrifuge was tared and subtracted from the sample+microcentrifuge mass. The masses recorded were the masses of the gel extracted: Dsp band:
Mass of Dsp: ~0.479 grams
Mass (ng): same intensity as first band of 1.0 kb ladder (as expected from the gel ladder bands)
Expected size (kb): 1.213
Observed size (kb): 1.2
PSB1C3 backbone:
Mass of pSB1C3 backbone: ~0.2018 grams.
Mass (ng): band excised was half of the intensity of the 3.0 kb band (as expected from the gel ladder bands)
Expected size (kb): 1.11 kb and 2.029 kb Observed size (kb): 1.2 kb and 2.0 kb
The gel bands extracted were the Dsp band size 1.2 kb and the 2.0 kb pSB1C3 backbone using the Gel Extraction protocol
Volume of QX1 added for pSB1C3 was: 1076.1 μL as 3 folds more so mass=358.7 mg so 358.7*3=1076.1
