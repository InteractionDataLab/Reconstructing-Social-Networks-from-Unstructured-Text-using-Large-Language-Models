Purpose of the Software Application
The main goal of the Android application is to reach a wide range of users - general practitioners, NGOs, healthcare in rural areas and even individuals who do not have prior knowledge of Sickle Cell Anemia. The app will help them with genetic counseling based on an individualâ€™s diagnosis or risk of being diagnosed with Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA).
The application serves three main purposes:
Raises awareness about Sickle Cell Anemia
Provides genetic counseling through accessible and known family history
displays the diagnosis results and a follow-up advising in an engaging manner
The Main Features:
Counseling by pedigree
Individuals will fill up the details about themselves, their partner (if applicable), their parents, their paternal and maternal grandparents where applicable. The algorithm at the backend will compute the family pedigree and analyze the risk accordingly. So they can check if their children are at a risk of being diagnosed with Sickle Cell Anemia, carrier or are unaffected. The different percentages will also have specific interpretations regarding their family planning.
Counseling by diagnosis
Individuals can take the test using our device. The application will display the results from the device and provide family planning advice accordingly.
Software specifications
The application is built using Cordova framework in Android Studio. The backend algorithm is designed in Javascript and the device connection is established over Bluetooth using Bluetooth API provided by Android.
