Hardware: The device is made of a TSL2591 module, an Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit, an OLED featherwing and a battery.
The device is a fluorescence sensor. It measures the light emitted by the sample by illuminating it with a UV LED. The device then continues by taking the measurement of the light reflected by the sample. The sensor, which is an Adafruit TSL2591 module, can not measure the UV spectrum, therefore there is no unwanted variation of data caused by the UV LED. The device does the processing of the data and displays it on a 1.25‚Äù OLED Display on the front side of the device. It also sends the data to a smartphone via bluetooth.
