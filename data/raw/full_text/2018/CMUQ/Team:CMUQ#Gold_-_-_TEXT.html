Medal Requirement
Bronze Medal
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
Meet all deliverables on the Competition deliverables page (section 4).
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly designate work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. Here
Participate in the Interlab Measurement Study. Here Here
SIlver Medal
Convince the judges that at least one new BioBrick Part of your own design that is central to your project works as expected. Document the experimental characterization of this part on the Main Page of that Part's Registry entry. Submit a sample of this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (following Registry submission guidelines). This working part must be different from the part documented in gold #2..
Convince the judges you have significantly worked with any other registered iGEM team in a meaningful way. For example, mentor a team, characterize a part, troubleshoot a project, model/simulate a system or validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem, or be the recipient of any of these activities.
Convince the judges you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your work is safe, responsible and good for the world. You could accomplish this through engaging with your local, national and/or international communities or other approaches. Please note that standard surveys will not fulfill this criteria.
Gold Medal
Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part. The original part must NOT be from your 2017 part number range. If you change the original part sequence, you must submit a new part. In addition, both the new and original part pages must reference each other. Please note, an alert of "Not Submitted" will appear to next to the existing BioBrick Part, and this is normal.
