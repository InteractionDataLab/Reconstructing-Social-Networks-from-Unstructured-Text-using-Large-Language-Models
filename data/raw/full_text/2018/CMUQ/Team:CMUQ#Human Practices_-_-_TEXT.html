Dr. Kyle Watters
P.h.D
In the Doudna Lab, Kyle began by winning a grant in conjunction with labs from UCSF and Sandia National Labs as part of the DARPA SafeGenes program. As part of this effort, Kyle is researching new methods to discover anti-CRISPR proteins which has culminated in a paper in Science describing three new anti-CRISPR proteins capable of inhibiting Cas12a. He continues to search for additional anti-CRISPRs and study their mechanisms of action. With the help of Ask a Scientist program from innovative genomics institute  (IGI) , iGEM team was matched with Kyle who took time to mentor us throughout the project. iGEM CMUQ team met with Kyle over skype and communicated via email to discuss and confirm our gRNA sequences and to share the idea of our project as whole. We gained invaluable insight and tips from his expertise in Cas12a and CRISPR in general. Website.
Dr. Anan Haffar
American Board Certified Pediatric.  Specialist in Immunology and infectious diseases
The interview gave us significant insight on how unaware people in the region are of genetic diseases and an overview of the degree of relative consanguinity. We also learnt that there are very few laboratories, and almost no hospital that conduct neonates genetic screening. Hence, many suffer from symptoms for so long without knowing the underlying reason. For more details check the write-up.
Dr. Jason Ford
American Board Certified Pediatric.  Division Chief of Hematopathology at Sidra Medicine in Doha, Qatar, and Associate Professor of Clinical Pathology & Laboratory Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine â€“ Qatar
The 45-min long interview with Dr. Jason served as our baseline for the project this year. We were given an insight on the current methods and tests to detect sickle cell anemia carriers (as well as SCA in babies, where the phenotype is often not present). The statistics from his experience as a practitioner in Sidra medicine further enhanced the purpose of our project and the need for a field-ready, non-invasive and affordable genetic (and bedside) screening. check the interview.

Dr. Mohammad Ghaly
Professor of Islam and Biomedical Ethics at the research Center for Islamic Legislation & Ethics (CILE), College of Islamic Studies at HBKU
This interview gave us an ethical guideline as to how to collect samples to test our device and confidential document results.. It also acknowledged our concern in terms of ethics and culture about requesting couples to undergo a quick test to enhance family planning. Please click here for full interview.
Dr. Khaled Al Homsi
American Board Certified Pediatric.Pharma D, Ph.D.Harvard Medical School Graduate.   Owner of Alhomsi Medical Center
The interview enhanced our  understanding the hematology aspect of genetic disorders screening. We learned the series of tests needed to make the diagnosis of Sickle Cell Anemia and Thalassemia based on Hemoglobin Capillary Electrophoresis peaks. In addition, we learned what steps should be taken after diagnosis.   For more details please check the write-up.
