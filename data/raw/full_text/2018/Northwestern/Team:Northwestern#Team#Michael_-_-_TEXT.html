Michael Johnson
Hey there, I’m Michael, a sophomore studying biomedical engineering! After undergrad, I plan to focus on biomaterials and regenerative medicine, while also obtaining a graduate degree at some point (TBD). This coming year at Northwestern, I’ll be leading a general chemistry study group, participating in Engineering World Health, and most importantly, trying not to drown in schoolwork. In my free time you can find me playing Rocket League or soccer, watching Netflix (hmu if you wanna talk Grey’s, Friends, Breaking Bad, or HIMYM), or procrastinating.
