Liza Fitzgerald
Hello! My name is Liza Fitzgerald, and I’m a junior studying applied mathematics in the McCormick School of Engineering. I’m very interested in seeing how mathematical models can be used to see trends and patterns in real world systems. When I’m not cheering wildly at Northwestern football games, I love reading, playing sudoku, and climbing trees.
