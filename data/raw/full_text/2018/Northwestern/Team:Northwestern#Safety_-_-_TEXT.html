Our lab was a certified Biological Saftey Level 1 laboratory handling non-pathogenic organisms. Before beginning work in our lab in the basement of the campus science and technology building, each member of our team underwent preliminary laboratory safety training through Northwesternâ€™s Office of Research Safety (ORS). We strove to follow standard microbiological practices and chemical procedures and protocols. Every wet-lab experiment was preformed wearing proper PPE (gloves, goggles, lab coats). All of our members received training covering: emergency procedures, disinfection,  sterilization, chemicals, fire and electrical safety etc. in June 2017. Laboratory safety procedures were demonstrated at the start of experimentation by our graduate student advisors.
