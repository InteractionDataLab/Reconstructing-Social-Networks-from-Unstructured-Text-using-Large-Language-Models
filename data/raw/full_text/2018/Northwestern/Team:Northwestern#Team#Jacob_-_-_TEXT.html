Jacob Kurian
Hi, my name is Jacob Kurian! I am a rising sophomore studying either ChemE or BME (we'll figure it out later). I am very interested applying synthetic biology, biomaterial engineering, and regenerative medicine to human needs. If I'm not in lab, I am either on that Northwestern work grind or posing awkwardly for photos.
