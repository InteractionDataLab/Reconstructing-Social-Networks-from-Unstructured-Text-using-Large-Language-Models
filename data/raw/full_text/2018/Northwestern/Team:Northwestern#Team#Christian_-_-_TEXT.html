Christian Thorsberg
Hello! My name is Christian Thorsberg, and I’m a sophomore studying chemical engineering and creative writing. I’m very interested in how synthetic biology can be utilized in the realm of astronomy, and plan on pursuing higher studies in the astro-biological fields. When I’m not taking weird turtleneck selfies, I enjoy running marathons and shopping at Burlington Coat Factory.
