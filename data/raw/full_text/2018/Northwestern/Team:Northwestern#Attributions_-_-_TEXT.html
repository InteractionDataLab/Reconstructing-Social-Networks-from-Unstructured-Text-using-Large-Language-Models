General Support
We wholeheartedly thank all of the following individuals and institutions for their interest and contributions to the development of this project. Their support is commendable and we thank them for expanding our synthetic biology toolbox.
We would like to thank our mentors Dr. Josh Leonard, Dr. Julius Lucks, Dr. Tullman-Ercek, Dr. Michael Jewett, and Dr. Keith Tyo for advising us throughout this process, providing us with countless reagents, attending our weekly meetings and making themselves available to answer any questions we had. We would also like to thank Dr. John Mordacq, Biological Sciences Professor at Northwestern, for letting us utilize his lab space for the duration of the summer and providing us with any necessary equipment and materials that we lacked.
Special thanks to the Northwestern 2017 team Jack Arnold, Lulu Sun,  Katerina Cheronis, Ayesha Rahman, Tyler Kramlich, Will Reinhardt, Charley Rees and Karen Taylor for guiding us through our iGEM journey, helping us become familiar with the lab space and giving us weekly bootcamps on cloning and proper lab technique. Thanks for providing the springboard for us to make more headway and coming to the rescue whenever we had yet another question.
Graduate Student and Post Doctoral Researcher Support
Thanks to our phenomenal graduate students and post-docs for taking time off their busy schedule to help us troubleshoot cloning and transformation problems, brainstorm new experiments, and teach us lab safety:
Bon Ikwuagwu: for reaching out and organizing a network of graduate students, meeting with us almost every day to talk to us about our project progress and coming to our meetings with words of encouragement.
Adam Silverman: for meeting with us to guide us through everything from learning what a plasmid is to requirements for cell-free reactions
Kirsten Jung: for helping us decide on various protocols, troubleshooting our failed transformations, teaching us about iPCR, and always being willing to answer questions.
Isaac Larkin: for expanding our knowledge on synthetic biology, helping us apply for the OpenTrons, and consistently offering his network of connections to help us fulfill various requirements.
Dr. Khalid Alam: for interviewing with us to provide knowledge on biosensors, giving initial ideas that formed our project, and troubleshooting.
Materials
Special thank you to Dr. John Mordacq, Dr. Julius Lucks, and Dr. Danielle Tullman-Ercek for providing reagents, supplies, and other materials for PCRs, gels, transformations, and experiments.
