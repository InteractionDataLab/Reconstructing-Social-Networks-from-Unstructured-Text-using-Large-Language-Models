Fostering relationships within the synthetic biology community is  a crucial component to the iGEM journey. By collaborating with other teams, we were able to aid our peers across the world while getting to know them a little better. Team MetaSense collaborated with iGEM teams by answering surveys, exchanging protocols, planning experiments and participating in an international effort to spread awareness and make synthetic biology more popular.
Purdue University collaboration
The Purdue University iGEM team also spent the summer working with cell-free expression of proteins and paper-based diagnostics. By Skyping with their team, we had the opportunity to exchange ideas at the start of our summer and discuss different protocols on getting our system on paper and exchange ideas about mathematical modeling of our system. We remained in contact throughout the summer and also had the opportunity to debug their paper-based assay.
University of Chicago Collaboration
Both UChicago and our team had trouble with the InterLab study during the early parts of our summer. Through comparison of our transformation protocols, both teams were able to successfully complete the InterLab study!
