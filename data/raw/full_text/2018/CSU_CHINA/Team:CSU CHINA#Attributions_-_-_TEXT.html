OUR TEAM
THE TEAM includes a mix of complementary expertise. In the end the work was naturally split between the members. Below each member of the efficient team is linked to their identifying tasks.
TEAM LEADER
Xiangyu Li was responsible for the whole experiment. He performed cloning, BioBrick construction and validation of the constructed parts. Xiangyu also coordinated our collaboration with team Nanjing-China and CPU_CHINA.
TEAM MEMBERS
Qingxin Shi was responsible for the construction of the first plasmid. He assembled the reporter plasmid and the corresponding biobricks. Qingxin is also in charge of handing all files submission online.
Yunfeiyang Li did all work on coding wiki design into HTML and CSS. Throughout the project he provided supportive models for us.
Zhaoyang Xiang is a student at the Faculty of Medicine. He brought to the group a wealth of information regarding medical practice. In the lab he started off with the Interlab study and then played an integral role in Human Practice having an interesting science class.
Jiaqi Xiao is a student at the Faculty of Medicine. Early on she helped with the Interlab study. Subsequently she played a supportive roles in Human Practice.
Jiamiao Liu was responsible for Human Practice . She organized several fantastic activities to expand the influence of our project to societies.
Jiayi Li studies life science at the Central South University in Changsha. She is a versatile teammate. In Human Practice, she was responsible for the Flash Mob. In our lab, she played a supportive roles in different modules as needed. She is also a supportive role in graphic design.
Ying Yang performed experiments to ensure the construction of our plasmids and assisted with other experiments. She was also responsible for the Flash Mob in Human Practice.
Shangcheng Yu is a bachelor student at the Faculty of Life Science at Central South University in Changsha. Shangcheng provided valuable knowledge and ideas during the development of the concept of our project and the design. He also assisted with our experiments.
Xiandong Peng is responsible for all work on graphic design. He made the standard results image of our experiments. Keyu Yao is responsible for our graphic design. She beautified our wiki.
Yufan Dong is a bachelor student at the Faculty of Life Science at Central South  University in Changsha.Yufan provided valuable knowledge and ideas during the development of the concept of our project.She contributed a lot to the building of our team.
THE ADVISORS
THE ADVISORS kept the work on track and helped answer the tough questions. They also checked wiki pages related to their field of expertise.
Weiqian Zeng was the main advisor of the team. She taught the students basics of synthetic biology and showed them how to use specialized equipment. She supervised the Biobrick construction and submission.
Yuelin Chen made sure all the deadlines are met and the loose ends are closed. In addition, she provided relevant literature and advice.
Shuai Guo provided valuable knowledge and ideas in modeling. His experience with data processing also proved useful in modeling our project.
THE INSTRUCTORS
THE INSTRUCTORS were closely involved keeping the message clear and the team on track to reaching the goals.
Kun Xia  as our first PI keeps the great mood in the lab and his accurate questions leads everyone to the result without any need for explanation.
Jiada Li is the PI of Li lab on which we depend and so gave us a number of advices of our experiments.
Shanni Li provided tremendous organizational support for our team throughout the duration.
