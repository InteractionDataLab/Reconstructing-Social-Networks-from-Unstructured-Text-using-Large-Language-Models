Composite Parts
We contributed to the Registry with one supportive part, ready to use in regulating expressions of other proteinsÂ . Function of the part was experimentally validated.
Promoter CMV can motivate the expression of GAL4-VP16 infusion protein which drives the expression of HSV-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) to achieve the tumor killing effect as gene therapy.
