HepG2, LO2, Huh7 and MCF7 cells were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS. All cells were cultured at 37°C  and 5% CO2. For transfection, HepG2, LO2, Huh7 and MCF7 cells were seeded at 4 ×  cells/well in 24‐well plates and transiently transfected by the lipo2000-mediated method. Briefly, each well is transfected with 15-30ng of constructed plasmid on two consecutive days.</P><H class="highlight-title dark-blue">Luciferase reporter assay</H><P>
Luciferase assays were performed as described previously. Briefly, the cells were transfected with 100 ng of the luciferase (firefly) reporter plasmid as designed containing different promoter into 24-well plate. After 48h transfection, cells were collected and lysed. Firefly luciferase activities were measured with the single-tube luciferase Reporter mechine and β‐galactosidase luciferase activity was used to normalize for potential differences in transfection efficiency. </P><H class="highlight-title dark-blue">Molecule cloning and mutation</H><P>
