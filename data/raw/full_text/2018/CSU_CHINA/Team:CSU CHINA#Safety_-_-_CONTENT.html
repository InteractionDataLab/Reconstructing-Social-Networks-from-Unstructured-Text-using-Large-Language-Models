</P><H class="highlight-title dark-blue">Biosafety Training</H><P>
All the team members followed a lab safety training and signed relevant safety documents prior to entering the lab at Central South University. A thorough and comprehensive lab safety training was provided by the biosafety offices of the universities and the departmental specialists as the flow chart below. And the biosafety training also has a Internet-based test and values 1 academic point for bachelor students.
</P><H class="highlight-title dark-blue">Biosafety rules and documents</H><P>
Our lab follow China National Institute of Pathogenic Microorganisms Biosafety Management and Central South University Laboratory Safety Rules as these aspects below.

Lab access and rules (those 3 rules below are specially supposed to remember for daily lab life)
1.Eating and drinking are not allowed inside the working area.
2.Anyone who is participating in the experiment is supposed to wear lab coats and protective goggles.
3.You are not allowed to wear protective goggles to touch any resting area or somewhere outside the lab.
Correct disposal of biological wastes and lab consumables
Differences between biosafety levels
Biosafety equipment and chemical safety(such as biosafety cabinets and chemical fume hood) 
Fire , water and electrical safety(We have fixed using time of large-scale scientific instruments and for sterilization)
Disinfection and sterilization
Transport rules
Emergency procedures
Responsible individuals (such as lab or departmental specialist or institutional biosafety officer)
Good microbial technique (such as lab practices)</P><H class="highlight-title dark-blue">Lab Biosafety Level</H><P>
The iGEM CSU_CHINA team of 2018 were working mainly in the BSL-1 lab at the Department of Life Science, Central South University for our project.</P><H class="highlight-title dark-blue">Work areas</H><P>
Which work areas do you use to handle biological materials?
Open bench
</P><P>
Biosafety cabinet
</P><P>
Chemical fume hood
</P><H class="highlight-title dark-blue">Personal protective equipment</H><P>
Team members were equipped with lab coats, protective goggles, and disposable nitrile gloves. No other protective equipment was necessary according to the lab biosafety guidelines.</P><H class="highlight-title dark-blue">Chassis</H><P>
We have worked with thecstrain of the biosafety level 1 approved bacterium E. coli  DH5alpha.</P><H class="highlight-title dark-blue">Specific risks</H><P>
Our project does not include gene drives, nor have we worked with animals. Despite of the standard antibiotics used in laboratory facilities (Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol), we have neither applied nor spread antimicrobial resistance factors. All species names (including strains) have been listed in the safety form.<A href="https://2018.igem.org/File:T--CSU_CHINA--Safety2018_Spreadsheet.xls">
