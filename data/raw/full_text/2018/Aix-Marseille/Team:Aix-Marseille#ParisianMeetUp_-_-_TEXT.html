Parisian Meet Up
Our team participated in the 4th Annual Parisian Meetup, organized by Pasteur_Paris . The meetup was attended by all 10 french iGEM teams and included project presentations and workshops.  We met many experts with different specialties, including bioethics, who enlightened us and helped us a lot in shaping our breaking bugs project.  Last, but certainly not least, we met one of the European after-iGEM ambassadors, Mr. Will Wright who, with his expertise, shared his iGEM adventures and helped us get in touch with other after-iGEM ambassadors so they could attend our very own Mediterranean meetup .
We sincerely thank the Pasteur Paris iGEM team for their invitation.
