Connecting with the iGEM community
Despite this importance of competition within iGEM, access to collaborations with competeing teams has nonetheless served to enrich our notions about our project.  We put aside our adversity to allow us to exchange advice, which has been of great mutual benefit to our team. We were able to establish a communication with two teams.
The Bielefeld team plans to recycle metals. This team explained to us how their research was going and how their team was involved in the wet lab. This allowed us to reflect on the organization of our team and the role of everyone in our project.
The Leiden team was working on the stress in bacteria. With them we were able to discuss the human practices part of our project. We told them about the different the events we had particiated in and those that were coming up. We were able to discuss the vision each team had of the importance of human practices and how we wanted to integrate it into our project.
Both these teams, although having different projets and subjects for the exchange, each contributed to advancing our project. The various contacts and exchanges we had with them confirmed the interest of ​​a universal and collective science.  Each team ensures the completion of their project but has different concepts about research and all the teams and help each other, criticize, arguing and improve the result.
We thank them for their advice!!
