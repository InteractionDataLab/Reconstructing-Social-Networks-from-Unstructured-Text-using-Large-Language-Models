Basic Parts
We made three basic parts during this years iGEM competition coding for 2 different enzymes.
BBa_K2718005
Methionine gamma-lyase (MGL) catalyzes the conversion of l-methionine into methanthiol, then the oxidation of methanethiol produces DMDS (Dimethyl disulfide) and DMTS ( Dimethyl trisulfide). BBa_K2718005 is an RFC 10 compatible part that we derived from BBa_K1493300 using PCR to add a his tag. To test activity we used the compositive part BBa_K2718006 [1]
BBa_K2718020
The Chit1 gene that codes for the endochitinase from the fungus Beauveria bassiana, an enzyme that degrads chitin, was made as BBa_K2718020 . It's endochitinase wich hydrolyses 1-4 beta link between N-acetyl-D-glucosamine monomeres the sequence comes from uniprot , we used the protein sequence between amino acid 41 to 330, that corresponds to the catalitic domain . We improved the DNA sequence with the IDT tool to optimize it for synthesis by E.coli. Part used the RFC 25 standard. We tested the activiy using Schales' method [2] with the part BBa_K2718022
BBa_K2718021
This part is the same as the chitinase BBa_K2718020 from Beauveria bassiana but we added a C-terminal oligo-histidine tag to the protein to facilitate purification and detection using a western blot. The part used the RFC 25 standard. We test enzyme activity of this part, and the availability of the his-tag for purification as BBa_K2718020 .
