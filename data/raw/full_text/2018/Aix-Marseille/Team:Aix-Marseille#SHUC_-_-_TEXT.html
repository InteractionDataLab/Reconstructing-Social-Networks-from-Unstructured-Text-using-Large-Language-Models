SOCIAL HOUSING UNION CONVENTION
One of the key problems of our project was the lack of visibility. Once there the press have talked about us, we have had multiple opportunities. Indeed we were invited to present our project at the 79th social housing union which is a confederation which gathers all the French providers of social housing. This represents about 730 different organizations that manage a total of 4.5 million housing units (flats and houses) and more than 22 000 people including reporters, conventioneers, companies and social agencies. The union organized its annual national congress in Marseille this year, on the 9th, 10th, and 11th of October.
The purpose of this event is to present the new goals of social agencies and companies and to solve usual problems by several ways : Power consommation, the differents helps and way we provide to usual people or again different problems companies have faced up (presence of asbestos in buildings, infestation by various pests)
Following our nationwide advertisement campaign, we were invited to the convention to present the breaking bugs project as an innovative solution to bed bugs infestations by providing a treatment, that can directly impact the inhabitants. Then we proposed them our innovating and ecological project. Without speaking about science and technics, our awareness sessions about GMO and synthetic biology was also exhibit who allowed us to receive invitations on « people concern » events.
Congress allowed us to meet companies and social agencies who asked us to keep them aware of our project in order to make futur collaborations and a bigger development of our project : financial propositions, collaborations in order to process to the tests of our prototypes or else propositions about helping on the communication part that would make the project known around the world.
