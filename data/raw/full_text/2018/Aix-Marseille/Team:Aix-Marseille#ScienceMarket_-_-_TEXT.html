SCIENCE FAIR
Created in 2003, the science fair in Marseille is a place to exchange ideas and popularize science using interactive, accessible, and fun activities.  The aim is to increase the scientific knowledge and awareness of the general public.  At the fair, we had two main products to sell to the public: synthetic biology and how it can address the current challenges faced by the public, and our breaking bugs project.
We delivered our ideas through three interactive activities.  Firstly, we used a dollhouse to model an infested household with a game.  In the game, the players had to find 12 bed bugs (Stickers) hidden in several appropriate locations. Thus, they learned where bed bugs could be possibly hiding in their homes.
Secondly, we brought the materials for the banana DNA experiment ,  so we could teach them about DNA and that all living things, bananas and people included, pass on information from one generation to the next using the same basic material, DNA.  Thirdly, we have created small sketches to simulate and explain to the public the basics about the breaking bugs project.
Among other things, our remarkable mascot Heisenbug was on board to lighten up the mood and attract the younger ones with their parents.We met kids and adults, succeeded in delivering our ideas and got lots of feedback on our project. Furthermore, we met with several researchers with whom we discussed the bioethics and biosafety challenges surrounding our project.
