2nd Mediterranean Meetup
For the second year in a row, the mediterranean meetup took place in Marseille on the 9th and 10th of August at the CNRS campus, with the same goal: giving the chance to iGEM teams from countries on the Mediterranean shores to attend a close-by meetup.
This year, 7 teams from Spain and France joined us: UPF_CRG_Barcelona , Madrid-OLM , Grenoble , Bordeaux , Pasteur_Paris , Paris_Bettencourt , and Montpellier . To present their projects and captivate the audience, the teams had 180 seconds. An initiative that was taken from Swissnex Brazil and Nano-Tera .
“This type of science contest not only helps students to feel more comfortable in presenting their work to others but also serves to inform the general public about the wide and exciting range of scientific research being carried out”.
- Adriano Bürgi, lead project manager of the event from swissnex Brazil.
In addition, poster sessions and various workshops debating around bioethics and after-iGEM aspects were held.
We had a caring judging panel to evaluate the presentations: Mr. Laurent VILLARD (Department of medical genetics at the Timone hospital ), M. Victoria SCHMIDT (Post-doctoral at the LISM laboratory), M. Leticia HOUOT (Secondary PI), Mr. Gauthier DANGLA PELISSIER (Instructor), Mr. Marlon SIDORE (Instructor), and M. Thea Chrysostomou the European after-iGEM ambassador
We thank all the attendees, and can't wait to check out the finalized projects in Boston.
4th Annual Parisian Meetup
Our team participated in the 4th Annual Parisian Meetup, organized by Pasteur_Paris . The meetup gathered all 10 french iGEM teams around projects presentations and workshops. We met bioethics, parasitology and many more experts who enlightened us and helped us in shaping our projects. Last but not least, we met one of the European after-iGEM ambassadors, Mr. Will Wright who, with his expertise, shared his iGEM adventures and helped us get in touch with other after-iGEM ambassadors so they can attend our very own mediterranean meetup.
We sincerely thank the hosting team for their invitation.
