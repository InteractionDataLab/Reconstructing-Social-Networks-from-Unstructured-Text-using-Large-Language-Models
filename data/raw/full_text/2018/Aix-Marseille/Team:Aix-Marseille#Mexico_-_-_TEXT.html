Mexico
A first contact with the Mexican team, Tecnológico de Monterrey , was over Skype.  They were interested in water pollution, a critical environmental problem affecting all sorts of different ecosystems and many communities close to natural and polluted water sources.  They asked us to help by providing them with water samples from different environments in France so they can analyze them with several techniques in order to make an overview of water pollution for their project.
As part of a reciprocal agreement, the Monterey team agreed to help us in filling out a survey in Mexico about the use of GMOs and Beauveria bassiana to fight bed bug infestations in their homes.
