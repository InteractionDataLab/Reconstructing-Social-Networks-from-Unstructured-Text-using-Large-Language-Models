The western blot thus confirmed the band identified on the SDS-PAGE corresponded to the methionine-γ-lyase produced by E.Coli DH5α bacteria and by E.Coli BL21 bacteria.
</P><P>For this test, it used 2 differents strains of E. coli Dh5 alpha which is similar to the strain DH1<A rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://biocyc.org/organism-summary?object=ECOL536056">[5]</A>, and a BL21 strain<A rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://biocyc.org/organism-summary?object=GCF_000022665">[6]</A>. First, negatives controls are correct, there is no prodution of methionine-y-lyase with empty plasmid. Then, the bands to approximatively 47kDa<A rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9SGU9">[7]</A>, correspond to methionine-y-lyase molecular weight in both case . Moreover there does not seem to be any significant difference in protein production between the 4 samples when the temperature varies in the DH5 alpha case, whereas this parameter seems to influence production in BL21, since production seems less pronounced at 16 °C. Overall, the production of methionine-y-lyase is lower when the host is a BL21 strain compared to a production in a strain DH5 alpha.
However, the methionine-γ-lyase protein is overproduced. After analyzing these results, the induction condition at 500 mM IPTG at 30 ° C is chosen for the rest of the experiments. This condition is the best in yield / time.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Methionine_gamma_lyase_purification">Methionine gamma lyase purification</SPAN></H2><P>After having realized the methionine-γ-lyase production tests, the purification of the latter is realized in order to obtain pure protein fractions. For this, the E. coli DH5 alpha cell lysates transformed with the construct <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2718006">(BBa_K2718006)</A> are purified. Purification of the protein is realized with pure AKTA pure® using a Ni Sepharose 6 column (HisTrap FF<A rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.gelifesciences.com/en/lt/shop/chromatography/resins/affinity-tagged-protein/histrap-ff-p-00251">[8]</A>). Akta Pure is a automated chromatography system for quick and easy purification.
The fusion of the histine tag with methionine-y-lyase allows to specifically separate the methionine-y-lyase from the total proteins.

Chromatogram of the purification of methionine-y-lyase-histag</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>In figure 4, there are 2 elution peaks. The peaks are not correctly separed and MGL is eluted on second peak, so the first peak samples contain contaminants. To confirm that the elution peak corresponds to the methionine-γ-lyase, an SDS-PAGE of the fractions corresponding to the elution peak as well as the non-retention is realized (fig.5).The deposit on the SDS-PAGE of the no-retained fraction allows to check if our has been retained on the column <A rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Aix-Marseille/Protocols">[9]</A>.

SDS PAGE after purification, NR = non-restraint, 1, 8 and 10-15 correspond to the eluted fractions</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>After SDS-PAGE visualization (fig. 5), the histidine tag allow to purify the methionine-γ-lyase from the total proteins. An intense band is observable approximately 47 kDa corresponding to methionine-γ-lyase. However, the 47kDa band is observable in the no-restrained, it means that there was too much protein and the used column saturated with our sample. To have a perfect purification of the methionine-y-lyase, it is possible to realize an exclusion chromatography. After purification, a pool of fractions 11 to 26 is made. A volume of 15 ml of methionine-γ-lyase at 2.7 mg / ml is obtained. So for 1l of cell culture 40mg of protein is obtained.
Now that the protein is purified, an activity test is done to check if the methionine is bioactive.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Methionine_gamma_lyase_activity">Methionine gamma lyase activity</SPAN></H2><P>To characterize the activity of methionine-γ-lyase, activity tests using DTNB is used. DTNB (5,5′-Dithiobis 2-nitrobenzoic acid) reacts with thiol group so for methionine-y-lyase, DTNB reacts with thiol group of methanethiol.
</P><P>To realize a methionine-γ-lyase activity test, we were interested in the substrates as well as in the products of methionine-γ-lyase. 
We have seen from the enzymatic reaction of methionine that the main subtrate was L-methionine, the products were methanethiol which by oxidation was transformed into DMDS / DMTS and 2-oxobutanoate (see <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2718006#Protein_activity">reaction</A>).
</P><P>By dosing of methanethiol by DTNB thus allows to determinate the activity of methionine-γ-lyase. The activity of methionine-y-lyase can be determined by dosing the second product of the reaction, 2-oxobutanoate, using the MBTH (3-Methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone hydrochloride hydrate). The MBTH reacts  with alpha-keto of 2-oxobutanoate.
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:902px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig 6.Results of activity test of methionine-y-lyase using DTNB. Both conditions are : DTNB only and protein + DTNB</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>In Figure 6, we observe that when comparing condition 1 (L-methionine alone without protein) and condition 2 (L-methionine + methionine-y-lyase), there is a strong increase in absorbance by a factor 12. Condition 1 corresponds to a negative control. 
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:902px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig 7. Results of activity test of methionine-y-lyase using DTNB. Both conditions are : Protein only and protein + DTNB</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>.
<P>In Figure 7, we observe that when comparing condition 1 (protein alone without the substrate: L-methionine) and condition 2 (L-methionine + methionine-y-lyase), there is a strong increase in the absorbance aproximately of a factor 12. Condition 1 corresponds to second negative control as in Figure 6.
</P><P>
These large increases in the absorbance between the two conditions (FIG. 6 and FIG. 7) biologically indicate that methionine-γ-lyase transforms L-methionine into methanethiol. We can therefore deduce that methionine-y-lyase is bioactive.

First, negative control that we made are as expected, there is no prodution of HmaS with an empty plasmid.

Moreover, there does not seem to be any significant difference in protein production between the 4 samples when the temperature  varies, in the case of DH5 alpha, whereas this parameter seems to influence production in BL21, since production seems less successful at 16 °C. Overall, the production of HmaS appears to be lower when the host is a BL21 strain compared to a production in a strain DH5 alpha. However what we can say now is that we found what seems to be an HmaS overproduction.

That is why we decided to do SDS-PAGE on the elution fractions to see if the protein is present (see figures 4a and 4b)<A rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Aix-Marseille/Protocols">[15]</A></P><P>Figure 4a SDS-PAGE of eluate after purifiction L.

However, what we can say is that HmaS is on fractions 8 to 17, which correspond to the second peaks on figure 3. 
In conclusion, we partly purifed HmaS. Moreover, we can improve this purification, by using other methods like size eclusion chromatography.

In order to test the mandelate synthase activity in our <I>E.coli strain</I>, we made an HPLC analysis of cell supernatents over 7h of cell culture as described in our <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Aix-Marseille/Protocols">protocols tab</A>. 
The elution profils have been analysed and were compiled into several figures that can be found in the <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Aix-Marseille/Notebook">Notebook</A>. All these data have been converted in order to substract the control values (DH5 alpha) and we have concentrated on the first 3h. During the exponential phase of growth we  saw a significant production. The resultant graphs are shown here. 
</P><P>Fig 5e. Hplc test results: (S)-mandelate rate evolution
</P><P>Fig 5f. Hplc test results: Phenylpyruvic acid rate evolution
</P><P>The first thing that can be noticed is the global decrease in phenylpyruvic acid and increase in (S) mandelate concentrations. 
There is some mandelate production in the control strain possibly due to non-enzymatic degradation of the phenyl-pyruvate.
We can conclude that there seems to be a (S) mandelate synthase activity, as the (S) mandelate rate are highter in our transformed strain than the <I>E.coli</I> strain with empty plasmid (in particular with the psb1c3 plamsid). 
However, we have not yet confirmed these results. 
In addition, the HPLC peak separation is not perfect, so a modification of the gradient parameters between solution A and B, as well as elution time, might improve the results.

As seen in Figure 1, a protein at  the expected length (30 kDa) was overproduced at 30°C after IPTG induction in DH5alpha. 
The un-induced cells show an low level of protein production. 
This overproduction should be the chitinase, but it strange that the clone N°11 wasn't able to produce much protein at 16°C and 37°C. We verified that the protein was chitinase with a western blot.

</P><P>Chitinase production was best after IPTG induction (at 500 mM) at 30°C. 
This condition of culture will be used to produce in large quantity chitinase for purification and activity tests.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Chitinase_purification:">Chitinase purification:</SPAN></H2><P>Chitinase designed had a polyhistidine-tag which allows it to be specifically separated from the total proteins. 
A purification using a His-trap collumn was used to purify Chit1, on an Akta Pure automated chromatography system.
The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column matrix allows a specific interaction between histidine residues and the bound metal ions  of the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid.
</P><P>In figure 3, an elution peak corresponding to the tagged chitinase visible, 
but a slight curve at the start of elution peak perhaps indicates a contaminant peak. 
There isn't a separation of these two peaks therefore contaminant proteins and protein of interest are eluted togeather in the first samples. 
According to the elution profile and SDS-PAGE, chitinase is present in fraction 6 to 9, but these samples weren't completely pure, a lot of nonspecific proteins were recovered. 
Another purification is required for better purity, unfortunately we didn't have time to repeat the purification. 
But we prove here that chitinase should be purified thank to its polyhistidine tag.

</P><P>As shown in figure 4, a protein at 30 kDa corresponding at the chitinase is obtained in the bacterial lysate, 
in the non-purified fraction and in fractions N°6 to N°10. These fractions were pooled and used for activity tests.
Numerous controls have been done,chitinase was produced without its peptide signal of secretion, so it will be contained in the cytoplasm,  the absence of the band at 30 kDa in the pellet verify that chitinase wasn't contained in the membrane.
Bacteria lysate confirmed the presence of chitinase at 30kDa; non-purified migration shows a low quantity of chitinase with all proteins contaminants; break-though sample didn't contain the protein target demonstrating that all chitinase was fixed on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix. 
</P><P>The results of chitinase purification prove that chitinase can be purified thanks to its polyhistidine-tag. But purification wasn't optimal and can be ameliorated because a lot of contaminants are isolated with chitinase. The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix column used was well-used, that can reduced its efficiency. For an optimal separation of chitinase, we should pool eluted fractions containing chitinase and purify to reduce the protein contaminants. But due to lack of time we continued with this purification to do activity tests.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Chitinase_activity_test:">Chitinase activity test:</SPAN></H2><P>Schales' procedure was used to test the chitinase activity. Schales' procedure is a colorimetric method commoly used for measuring the reducing sugars. 
Chitin is composed of sugar units of either N-acetyl-G-glucosamine. Chitinase degrade chitin producing N-acetyl-G-glucosamine. To monitor chitinase activity, the reducing sugars released after chitin hydrolyse are detected by a color diminution of the yellow Shales' reagent. This color diminution is translated by a absorbance diminution.
</P><P>
To analyse activity test results, an etalon curve have been done using the final product of chitinase reaction (N-acetyl-G-glucosamine), to know in which concentration of final product must be obtained after reaction to be detected by the method of Schales. 
</P><P>Figure 5: Etalon curve of N-acetyl-G-glucosamine after Schales's activity test.
</P><P>A final curve has been obtain showing a absorbance diminution in function of increasing N-acetyl-G-glucosamine concentration. 
With this etalon curve, concentration of final product obtain after chitinase reaction can be determined. This results revealed the efficiency of Schales'procedure to detected N-acetyl-G-glucosamine to 0 at 200 uM.
</P><P>Figure 6: Table of absorbance measurements of chitinase activity test
</P><P>Figure 7: Chitinase activity test by Schales' procedure
</P><P>According to figure 7, after 30 minutes of reaction a significant activity was mesured. 
But after 1 hour of reaction the standard deviation was unfortunately very large. 
One of the difficulties encountered with the assay was the chitin sample. Colloidal chitin is suspended in water, but made from partially hydrolysed shrimps shells and this was difficult to pipet and caused problems with reproducibility. 
We added a centrifugation step to the protocol but precipitated chitin sometimes became resuspended and altered the results. 
After centrifugation chitin wasn't really pelleted, it was easily removed. 
This problem with chitin pelets is the origin of the high standard deviation in the 1hour point.
</P><P>Thanks to our standard curve, considering the results after 30 minutes, we can conclude that the initial rate of the reaction, our chitinase can released 125 uM of N-acetyl-G-glucosamine. An initial rate of chitin hydrolysis of 4 uM/min. 
</P><P>Figure 8: Table of measurements of controls for chitinase activity test
</P><P>
Controls were realized to be sure that the reduction of absorbance is due to chitinase reaction. A control with Schales'reagent and water show a hight absorbance by the colorimetric reactant, when chitin was added absorbance decreased that was expected because of chitin reducing sugar ends.

During one week, we put traps containing our fungus, the pheromones or both of them, in infested places with bed bugs. The protocol is available on our <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Aix-Marseille/Protocols">Protocols</A> tab.
The traps observation after recovery and freezing showed us that we caught a bedbug in one of our traps containing the pheromone cocktail and <I>Beauveria bassiana</I>. So we can conclude that the bedbugs do visit our traps.
