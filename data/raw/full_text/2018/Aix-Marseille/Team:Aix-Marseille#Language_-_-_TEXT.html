Language project
The Chinese team OUC-China created a comic book where it describes microbiology aspects to the non-scientific community. They wanted to translate it into several kinds of languages in order to popularize synthetic biology and they proposed us to translate the book into our native language (French).
So we jumped on board this interesting educational project, where the team sent us the English script of the comic book and we translated it into French . Translating this comic book was very rewarding: see how the members of the Chinese team explains notions of biology judiciously with an electric circuit or even having to discover notions that we didn't know before.
We would have liked to go much further in this collaboration. For example we could have used these comic books in interventions with the public, but we couldn't for lack of time. But if we could, we would have done it without hesitation.
In addition, on the Chinese team, the French comic strip was printed, and some brochures were distributed in local schools and they explained the importance of this collaboration through the diversity of languages. We were more than happy to take part in one of the largest educational collaborations.
