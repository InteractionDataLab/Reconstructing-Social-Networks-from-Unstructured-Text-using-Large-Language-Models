Postcard exchange program
By team Düsseldorf
For the second year in a row, we took part in the postcard exchange program organized by team Düsseldorf next to 39 other teams from all over the world. These postcards were all bout promoting synthetic biology to the public. Each team had to come up with a postcard design and sent 100 copies to the organizing team so they can equally distribute them.
After sending our postcards, we finally received the other postcards from all around the world. It was a really fun way to discover the projects of other teams and to see the creativity of each one of them through the postcards design. Some of them were so funny and beautiful that some team members chose to keep them for themselves.
Representing our home cities, describing our projects and coming up with creative designs: an all-in-all interesting experience and iGEM aspect. Looking forward to meeting all the teams in Boston.
