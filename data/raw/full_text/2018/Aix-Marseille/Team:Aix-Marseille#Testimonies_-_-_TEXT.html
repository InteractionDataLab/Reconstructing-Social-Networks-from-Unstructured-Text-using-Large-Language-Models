Testimonies
Thanks to a successful media publicity campaign, we had a great opportunity to get testimony from people who have suffered from bed bug infestations. Indeed, we were very surprised by the great interest the publicity generated, showing us the degree of suffering endured by people facing bed bug infestations. In particular, the various testimonies we collected allowed us to obtain more information about infestation time and affected areas. Based on these observations we targeted and modelized affected area in order to design the most efficient trap.
Here we have translated the testimonies which we found the most interesting.

Hello,
I wish to give you my testimony about bed bugs.  First, we noticed bites on our body and thought that it was only from mosquitos.  Then we found people on the Internet having similar symptoms.  We inspected our room and quickly found these infamous bugs on our electrical outlets and our mattress.  After searching for solutions on the Internet we decided to treat our mattress and our clothes with sprays.  We also used a high pressure vaporiser in our struggle against bed bugs because we saw that beg bugs are sensitive to high temperatures.  However after 2 weeks we noticed a resurgence of bugs.  For us, it was a psychological torture to live with this threat.

The only effective method I found is: Vacuum first, then pass the 'vapocleane' all over the skirtings etc ... then spread insecticides and leave the room. But I noticed that with time and exposure, they got used to the chemicals. The chemical solution is therefore just there to encourage them to leave but does not really destroy them and moreover, it represents a danger for our health. Product very harmful to breathe.

Hello,
I write in total despair. For eight months we have been infested by bed bugs (1st district). We rented a steam cleaner, bought a freezer and tumble dryer, changed our sheets, box springs, pillows, mattresses. We threw away all our books and clothes. One company made 7 passes, and our apartment is stuck with the remains of insecticide products. The children are stung and unhappy. We spent thousands of euros (I also paid for the disinfection of the entire building, all to no avail) The local pest authority does not have any solutions, the city hall of Marseille is not interested. Honestly, I am in despair. All we have left is your trap.
