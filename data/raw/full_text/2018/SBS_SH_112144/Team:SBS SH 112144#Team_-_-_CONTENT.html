I am a junior at the Stony Brook School on Long Island, New York. As the captain of the entire team, I oversee and participate in every aspects of the project including experiment design and execution, activity discussion, and wiki edition. I have a vision for this team that everyone involved will grow in both character and skill. As a Christian &quot;philosopher&quot;, the theme of life intrigues me- this is why I love biology. I have lots of experience with biology: internships in hospital, summer sessions in University of Chicago, labs in the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and AP Bio class at school. I wish to learn as much as possible during the iGEM preparation and lead my team to strive for excellence!</P><P class="name">Andy Wang</P><P class="team">Team Leader</P><P class="txt">I am Yicheng (Andy) Wang, a student dabbling in the field of synthetic Biology and employed iGEM as the first springboard from the elementary course material to practical lab works. I would admit participating iGEM to be a painstaking process as I paralleled the research with organization of the team. Neither multitudinous experience as a leader nor advanced academic skills were possessed of me, yet I do embrace the honor to perform as one of the leaders and stride with my teammates on the path of pursuing academic excellence as well as consummation of inner spirit. Extensive experiments were implemented and the team peeked into the hardship of scientific research, not only from the repetitive trials and failures, but also through the attempts to raise requisite funding. iGEM will unquestionably be placed as the first milestone of my career, and I believe, in God's testimony, hope will be fulfilled through diligence.</P><P class="name">Dylan Zou</P><P class="team">Team Member</P><P class="txt">I'm Taojun (Dylan) Zou from Friends Central School. As the dry Group manager, my extensive work includes leading the team to plan and conducting human practice activities, as well as overseeing the progress with an eye on putting our product into application. At first, I joined the competition out of my interest in biology and was excited to make something that could really change the life of millions of people with synthetic biology. I still feel the same way, but I've come to realize that how much a technology change people's life is not justified by how cuttingedge it is, but how effective and useful it is in the life.</P><P class="name">Molly Lin</P><P class="team">Team Member</P><P class="txt">I'm Molly Lin from SEFLS.

Currently, I am a member of the wet group, which focuses on experiments and results. I spent the whole summer working on our biological project in Shanghai. I found iGEM inspiring me on science. It not only elevated my academic ability but also taught me cooperation skills. Investigating and doing research are challenging for a high school student. We definitely struggled a lot, but we made it eventually. I eventually realize that biology is not a simple subject: it relates to social science, economy, engineer, etc, which have significant impacts on our life. I appreciate this amazing experience.</P><P class="name">Miranda Zheng</P><P class="team">Team Member</P><P class="txt">Hello! I'm Zhiyi(Miranda) Zheng from Shanghai, China. I am currently a sophomore from St. Stephen's Episcopal School in Austin, Texas. I'm the co-manager of Dry Group as well as the co-director for our homepage video. I'm very glad to be a part of our team this year, and I also enjoyed working with different people. In addition to gaining more academic knowledge, iGEM to me is also a fantastic teamwork experienceâ€”confronting an issue, struggling with it, and solving it altogether. When I'm not working on anything academic, you may find me dancing, fencing, making film, or hanging out with people!</P><P class="name">Yu Xia</P><P class="team">Team Member</P><P class="txt">My name is Yu Xia , I am a member of the wet group. I am responsible for the molecular cloning part of the experiment. Before I joined in the iGEM team , I did only a few simple experiments at school: so this is almost my first time to participate in such an amazing event. By doing the experiments, I grew in my knowledge and broadened my horizon. I also learned how to work with a team. In the future, I want to do more research in biology and be a real scientist.</P><P class="name">Haocheng(Harry) Li</P><P class="team">Team Member</P><P class="txt">I study at Xiangming Senior High School, Shanghai, China.

I had some lessons before the experiment started and participated in the discussion, and later I joined the dry group and deal with the work mostly concerning Human Practice. I also went to the laboratory on my free time to help other team members, as well as improving the understanding of our topic.
