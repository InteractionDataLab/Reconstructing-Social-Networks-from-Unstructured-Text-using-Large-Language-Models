Thanks to our entire team's industrious work and dedication that we are able to accomplish the goals. During the summer, we divided the entire workload into two components: dry group and wet groups. With the former group dealing with social approach while the later dealing with laboratory approach, we combined the efforts into a very effective system to tackle the problem of cyanobacteria pollution.
Dry Group (Agnes, Dylan, Miranda, Herui Song, Fred, Molly, Harry)
Organized the online and offline research.
Sponsored the academic forums and receptions.
Prepared the Human practice, video, and public engagement part of the wiki.
Wet Group (Wensan, Andy, Mia, Yu Xia, Candy, Peicheng Ji, Yang Xu )
Designed the theme and research focus of the experiment
Carried out the experiment as well as device design
Modeled the result of the experiment
Prepared the Project, Demonstration, Interlab, Modeling, and Parts parts of the wiki.
Team members (missing Yu Xia and Yang Xu)
Project Support and Advice
Professor Chu, Rongwei
School of management Professor, Fudan University. Visiting scholar of MIT Sloan School of Management. Due to his expertise in human resources, he led us to make team schedules and advised on the layout of some major parts including the wiki and poster.
Professor Xiao, Yibei
China Pharmaceutical University Professor, visiting scholar of Cornell University; He is the primary investigator of the team.
Professor Zhang, Yu
Professor, PhD Tutor of Institute of Plant Physiology&Ecology, SIBS, CAS. He is working on new antibiotic based off of bacterium's RNA polymerase. He offered us laboratories to work on our experiments.
Professor Wang, Shoubing
Professor of Fudan University Environmental Science department. He travelled with us to lake Taihu, offered detailed information about current situation concerning cyanobacteria pollution, and provided insights on our special approach with the lysozyme.
Professor Zhou, Hu
Professor of Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, CAS, PhD Tutor. He is engaged in ​Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry methodology and disease-related proteomics researching. He offered our team laboratories for us to perform our experiments as well.
Professor Zheng, Fangfang
PhD Researcher of Chinese Academy of Science. He provided technical support to our experiment execution. We would like to express our special gratitude to him, without whom it would be much harder for us to obtain ideal experimental data and analysis.
Acknowledgements
Subcat Academy helped with the recruitment of the team and resolved many technical problems for us. They assisted in publicizing the detailed idea of our project. They also seeked academic resources such as laboratories and tutors, so that we could get a strong academic support. We are thankful for their provision of gentle guidance and academic support which lead to a great iGEM working experience. Website
SnapGene offers molecular biology software that offers a fast and easy way to plan, visualize, and document molecular biology procedures. The team would like to thank Snapgene for providing us with licenses that we have used to help visualize our genetic constructs.
