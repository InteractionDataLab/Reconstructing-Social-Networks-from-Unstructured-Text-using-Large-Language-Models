Here, we have a whole range of images spanning across our project. From our beginnings with InterLab work and project ideas, to attendance at the Giant Jamboree, we hope our gallery gives you an insight to how busy and wonderful the summer was working on iGEM. Each photo was taken either by ourselves or a supervisor unless otherwise stated; enjoy!
Team Stash
The team gathered outside to take a photo in their new T-shirts.
Bioreactor Blueprints
Matt and Amy deep in the bioreactor modelling discussion. Model: 3.1.1.
Pipetting Practice
Emily pipetting cells into foiled falcon tubes, ready for overnight cultures to grow.
Rareus scientificus
Amy and Sophie exploring the campus and having a break.
AMA Proof
Our photo to prove we are genuine for the Ask Me Anything.
Thermocycling
Fiona using the thermocycler on our Cld DNA
Western Preparation
The different bands of separation show the progress of DNA separation
Labelling Triumph
It was this day that we discovered the joys of a labelling machine - no longer cramping from hand-writing on hundreds of small tubes!
"iGEM only"
All of our pipettes are labelled in the lab, to see who's left what mess behind...
F-A-C-S
Part of a much bigger machine, here we can see a tube with liquid ready to be sent around the FACS machine.
Oxford Meetup
A photo of our team at the UK iGEM meetup taken by Nicky Hurst.
Microscopy
Nahnsu and Sophie working on their Perchlorate testing assay.
Ram Lunch
Some of our team went for lunch in the Ram bar on campus.
PML Bioreactor
Matt and Eleanor watching Plymouth Marine Laboratory's bioreactor working for the first time.
Bioreactor Box
Inge and Amy built a box to transport the model bioreactor in. This was the moment we checked that it fit.
Great Escape
One of our iGEM team members trying to escape the lab! Don't worry, she was safely recaptured using caving equipment as bait.
