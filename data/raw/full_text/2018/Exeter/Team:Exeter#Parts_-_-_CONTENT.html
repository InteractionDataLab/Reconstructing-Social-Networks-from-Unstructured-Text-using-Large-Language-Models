Teams may use the parts in this collection to allow their chassis to reduce chlorite to chloride and oxygen, which might be useful for soil detoxification or O<SUB>2</SUB> production where chlorite or perchlorate is present. For perchlorate reduction, the enzymes below must be used along with Perchlorate Reductase (see above) as that enzyme reduces ClO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> to ClO<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>, which is the substrate that chlorite dismutase uses.

The 4 chlorite dismutase coding sequences in this collection are from 4 different species of bacteria. Exeter iGEM 2018 has shown, using a Western blot, that all coding sequences can be expressed in <EM>E. coli</EM>  BL21(DE3). As the four enzymes have different kinetic parameters, future teams can choose which enzymes best suits their specific chassis. Choosing the right enzyme, with the right kinetic parameters will allow teams to balance metabolic flux of intermediate substrates through pathways whilst avoiding overburdening cells with unnecessary enzyme expression.
