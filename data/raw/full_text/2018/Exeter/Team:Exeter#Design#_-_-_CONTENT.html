They were to be identical other than an attachment for Mars which would allow the input of regolith rather than water. 

We wanted to improve upon the bioreactor designed by previous iGEM team, <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Leiden/Bioreactor" style="color: black;"><B> Leiden 2016</B></A>, so this was where our bioreactor started. It was very simple with mobilised bacteria being mixed with perchlorate in a single chamber.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="carousel-item"><DIV class="carousel-caption carousel-text-only d-md-block"><H3>Design 2</H3><P class="w-50 mx-auto" id="carouselDescription">We decided to try and have the two reactions (perchlorate to chlorite, and chlorite to chloride and oxygen) taking place in separate areas of the bioreactor. Because the operons involved the whole process is so long, we were hoping that this would allow us to insert less DNA into <I>E. coli</I>, making expression more likely.  

However, this idea didn’t last long enough for us to come up with a design, as we discovered that chlorite is toxic to <I>E. coli</I> and so it would all have to take place in one chamber and with one operon.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="carousel-item"><DIV class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block"><H3>Design 3</H3><P class="w-50 mx-auto" id="carouselDescription">After reading <I>Biotechnological Applications of Microbial (Per)chlorate Reduction</I> (Ouwei Wang and John D. Coates, 2017) we considered the idea of growing <I>E. coli</I> on a cathode in order to provide it with more electrons and speed up the reaction by up to 12%. The paper proposed a bioreactor in which DPRB (disparate perchlorate reducing bacteria) grew on a cathode, supplying ions that seemed to be a limiting factor in the reaction. Hydrogens would pass from the anode to the cathode through  a cation selective membrane, aiding the reaction in the diagram (left). This would speed up the first half of the process, converting perchlorate to chlorite, as this is the slower half. We would simply replace the DPRB with modified E. coli. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="carousel-item"><DIV class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block"><H3>Design 4</H3><P class="w-50 mx-auto" id="carouselDescription">A meeting with Dr Mike Allen from the Plymouth Marine Laboratory introduced us to the concept of Swirl Flow Bioreactors (SFB), which would allow us to mix the perchlorate with the <I>E. coli</I> as well as separating the oxygen, all in one chamber. We took the design of a typical swirl flow and adapted it to fit our needs of having immobilized <I>E. coli</I> and a cathode.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="carousel-item"><DIV class="carousel-caption carousel-text-only d-none d-md-block"><H3>Design 5</H3><P class="w-50 mx-auto" id="carouselDescription">In a second meeting with Dr Mike Allen, he also told us valuable information about how our bioreactor would be received within global markets. He informed us of his experience with selling and developing his own bioreactor, and from that, he advised that we focus more on the Mars travel side of the the bioreactor as there wasn’t much room in the market for a bioreactor on Earth. 

During this meeting, we decided to remove the cathode from our design as it would provide the opportunity for unexpected chemistry, as well as sparks which would react badly with the oxygen we are producing.  This allowed our bioreactor design to simplify significantly and we started making quick progress.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="carousel-item"><DIV class="carousel-caption carousel-text-only d-none d-md-block"><H3>Design 6</H3><P class="w-50 mx-auto" id="carouselDescription">
Our first SFB without cathodes involved four chambers, one to mix the regolith with water to extract the perchlorate, and three to consecutively reduce the perchlorate into oxygen until none is left.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="carousel-item"><DIV class="carousel-caption carousel-text-only d-none d-md-block"><H3>Design 7</H3><P class="w-50 mx-auto" id="carouselDescription">
With a solid base, we began to tweak the design based on the needs of stakeholders.
