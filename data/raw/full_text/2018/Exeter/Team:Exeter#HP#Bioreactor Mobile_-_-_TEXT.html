As we communicated with more experts, we realized the area of our project most relevant to human practices was our bioreactor design. We put effort into specifically investigating its requirements and limitations, and our stakeholders helped shape our design throughout the project. They informed our decisions about what type of bioreactor to design, advising us to focus on a bioreactor for reducing perchlorate on the Martian surface, rather than in Earth drinking water. Our stakeholders also helped raise many issues that we needed to answer. We needed to address the issues of E. coli survival and optimization for perchlorate reduction, issues of maintenance and energy efficiency, issues of biosecurity and ethics, and finally, integration into existing infrastructure. Through constant communication and research, we managed to find solutions to these issues, until we reached our current formulation.
Below, you will find a timeline of design steps that were taken in order to reach our final bioreactor.
1: Initial Designs
(Tap to enlarge.)
The iGEM Leiden 2016 team’s project was similar to ours, and so we took inspiration from their work. Our first bioreactor design was along the same lines as Leiden 2016’s. It was very simple design, shown above, with mobilised bacteria being mixed with perchlorate in a single chamber. However, it was only a starting point.

Specialists in DPRB (disperate perchlorate reducing bacteria), John D Coates and Ouwei Wang had drawn up loose designs for bioreactors using their research, shown above. In their design, hydrogen atoms would pass from an anode to a cathode through a cation selective membrane, aiding the reaction in the diagram below. This would speed up the conversion of perchlorate to chlorite, a rate limiting step. The design also switched to immobilised bacteria which reduces the chances of E. coli escaping.
From them we got the idea of using a cathode system to aid perchlorate reduction. After contacting them, we also gained insight into the different parts we needed to insert into our chassis, and the existing parts of E. coli that could be harnessed. They had been working on disparate perchlorate reducing bacteria, and offered a lot of input on how to apply their research to synthetic biology, bringing up the idea of bioreactors for bioremediation on Earth and on Mars.
Dr Clive Butler helped us to understand the needs and properties of bacteria that reduce compounds. From him we realised that we would have to supply haemin, molybdenum, and iron sulphate to our E. coli as the enzymes that reduce perchlorate are metalloenzymes.
2: Earth versus Mars
We wanted to investigate the breadth of and demand for this project. We began researching the issues that perchlorate causes and the possible applications that our project would have.
Our initial research into bioreactors suggested that there is a need for a smaller, more efficient bioreactor in comparison to the large fluid and solid bed bioreactors currently reducing perchlorate on Earth. However, Dr Ceri Lewis , an ecotoxicologist, informed us that perchlorate in water sources is not a prominent environmental issue. More information about the spread and severity of perchlorate needs to be known before it can be determined whether this is a sufficiently useful project, and this information wouldn’t be available within the timescale of the project.
Professor Mike Allen of Plymouth Marine Laboratory, a biochemist with experience in bioreactor design, advised us that if there was a real effort to remediate perchlorate contamination, it would occur on site and not at water sources. This is due to the soluble nature of perchlorate, meaning it would spread through water sources very quickly. In order to bioremediate it, you would have to run the entire water source through the bioreactor, which is infeasible. He told us that he didn’t see much demand for a novel perchlorate reducing bioreactor on Earth.
3: Deciding on A Martian Bioreactor
We contacted iGEM teams in areas where perchlorate contamination seemed to be problem. Many of the teams had never heard of perchlorate and were unaware it was a problem, indicating that it is not a major problem, even to those with higher than normal levels. We hoped that they could test their tap water themselves, as our attempts to get in contact with American cities’ water and power departments ended due to bureaucratic restriction. We managed to collaborate with an American team in Virginia , working with them on a perchlorate assay. We did not find significant level of perchlorate in their water.
Looking closer to home, we also got in touch with South West Water and spoke to one of their Water Quality Specialists, Tim Coates, asking for a water quality report for our local area of Devon. They informed us that perchlorate is not a pollutant they are concerned about, and that they do not test for perchlorate in their water.
It was concluded that perchlorate was not such a large issue as previously thought, and there was little to no demand for a bioreactor that could filter it out of existing water systems. Thanks to all of this stakeholder input, we decided to focus on a Martian bioreactor rather than a Earth one.
4: Swirl Flow Bioreactor
(Tap to enlarge.)
After we had decided that our bioreactor would be designed for Martian use, we spoke again with Professor Mike Allen . He introduced us to the concept of Swirl Flow Bioreactors (SFB), which would allow us to mix the perchlorate with the E. coli and separate the oxygen, all in one chamber. We took the design of a typical swirl flow bioreactor and adapted it to fit our needs of having immobilized E. coli and a cathode, shown above.
However, as Professor Allen pointed out, having an electric current in the bioreactor would provide opportunity for unexpected and unwanted reactions, while not contributing significantly to the rate of reaction. Therefore it was decided that the design should be simplified and the cathode removed. He introduced the concept of alginate beads for containing the E. coli to us. Plymouth Marine Laboratory were kind enough to lend us one of their Swirl Flow bioreactors, which we used to test whether the beads would be suitable.
(Tap to enlarge.)
Our first SFB without cathodes involved four chambers, one to mix the regolith with water to extract the perchlorate, and three to consecutively reduce the perchlorate into oxygen until none is left. It is shown above. However, this had high energy requirements due to four impellers being powered at once, and could be simplified further.
5: Mars Design
We contacted Nick Musgrove , commercial director of Infors HT to help us understand the basics of bioreactor design. Using the information gathered from this talk we drafted the features that we envisaged our bioreactor having to optimise it for perchlorate reduction.
In order to develop our idea further, we needed to ascertain how regolith would be entered into our bioreactor. Dr Ben Reeve , CTO of CustoMem, a company specialising in biomembranes, discussed with us whether a biomembrane would be an effective measure for getting perchlorate into our reactor. As a result of this talk it was decided that a biomembrane would be an unnecessary complication to our bioreactor and could not achieve anything that a simple sieve-like filter couldn’t.
Understanding how our bioreactor would be used and who would operate it was a key consideration in our design process and Libby Jackson , a flight coordinator the UK Space Agency, illuminated this for us. We learned how bacteria are stored and experimented with in spacecraft, the priorities that astronauts have when experimenting, and the legal precedent of taking modified E. coli into space. She raised valuable questions of biosecurity that we had to answer.
6: Tailoring the Bioreactor For Mars
With a solid base, we began to tweak the design based on the needs of a bioreactor on Mars, with the help of our stakeholders. We determined the most important aspects of a Martian bioreactor:
Figure 1: A diagram of the chemical structure of Ultem, a polymer often used for 3D printing.
3D printable and light. This is due to limitations on what we could take to the planet. Michael Curtis-Rowse informed us that our procedures on Mars could be automated and that no human interaction with the bioreactor should be required. He helped determine the kind of materials we would have to make the bioreactor out of (printable plastic, Ultem, shown above).
Resource efficient. Power consumption has to be low, in order not to drain the resources of the rest of the biodome. By reducing the bioreactor to one chamber and one impeller, it is possible to drastically reduce the energy requirements, since that is the main use of power.
Shielded from radiation. Without protection, our bacteria will die on the Martian surface. The shielding also needs to be light enough to take to Mars. High Z Steel-Steel Composite Metal Foam (HZ S-S CMF) can block UV rays and neutrinos as well as pure lead (Shuo Chen et. al., 2015), while being much lighter and environmentally friendly.
Safe. There must be a way to kill the bacteria in the bioreactor in the case of unwanted mutations or other unforeseen events. Fortunately, in the event of escape, the UV on the surface would kill any bacteria which made it out of the bioreactor. In the case of unwanted mutation, running copper-alginate beads through the bioreactor has been shown to kill E. coli (Simon F. Thomas et. al., 2014).
We also thought briefly about where we could place the bioreactor on Mars. Alex Price informed us of which areas are protected, and which would be viable landing spots. Professor Charles Cockell introduced us to the idea of the planetary park system, which could protect certain areas from contamination while allowing others to become potentially habitable.
7: Integrating into Existing Infrastructure
It was at this point we started thinking about integrating our bioreactor into systems that might exist in the future. We spoke to Melanie Pickett from NASA about their existing life support system, and how we could fit our bioreactor in with it. She highlighted the importance of protocols for disposing of old bacteria, and got us thinking about methods of regenerating the alginate beads as well as our water to soil ratio. We also spoke briefly to Professor Claude Gilles Dussap from the ESA about their life support system, Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative programme (MELiSSA).   When talking to these companies, they specifically requested a Computer Assisted Design (CAD) image in order to fully understand our developments so far, which we generated, as shown below.

8: A Future for the Bioreactor
After talking closely with stakeholders throughout the entire design process, we settled on a final design. The design features a single impeller chamber in which the reaction will take place. Water will be flowed with regolith and beads into the chamber, where the perchlorate will bind with the water before reacting with the E. coli in the beads. The filtered soil will then be deposited in waste, since it will be the most dense material. Oxygen produced by the reaction will be the least dense, and so the vortex will concentrate it in the centre of the chamber, to be carried out via a manifold. The remaining water will be recycled back into the chamber for the next reaction. It is a simple but efficient design.
If we had more time, it would be valuable to build and test a prototype, however, we were lucky enough to experiment with an existing, similar bioreactor which gave us an idea of how our design would work. In the future, we would like to keep communicating with our stakeholders and develop our design into a fully functioning bioreactor, producing oxygen on Mars.

University of Virginia iGEM Team
Their project, Quorus, explores quorum sensing and how it can be applied to biomanufacturing. Heterogeneity of cell populations caused by quorum sensing leads to variability in gene expression that is hard to predict. During biomanufacturing, elevating quorum-induced protein expression will lead to gain of profit. Decreasing this expression can also be beneficial in situations where undesirable biofilms may form on medical equipment or controlling virulence in bacteria. Their team will  modify the existing bacterial quorum sensing system controlled by the Lsr operon by upregulating the synthesis and excretion of Autoinducer-2 , a universal quorum molecule. This will increase population-scale AI-2 intake and phosphorylation after the initial AI-2 threshold concentrations have been reached to reduce variability in induced gene expression. https://2018.igem.org/Team:Virginia
