BBa_K2695000
Coding
A. suillum cld
Submitted to iGEM as a basic part in pSB1C3 with a His-tag inserted between signal peptide and enzyme sequence. The enzyme catalyses the reduction of chlorite to chloride and oxygen. For our project it is the second step of our enzyme pathway to reduce perchlorate to oxygen. One of four chlorite dismutases used in this project, all with different predicted rates of reaction.
For use in the lab, modular cloning was used to add a T7 inducible promoter and B0015 terminator.

BBa_K2695012
Coding
pcrA
Synthesised with T7 promoter and the coding sequence for Azospira suillum pcrA. A His-tag inserted between the signal peptide and the enzyme sequence. PcrA forms a periplasmic heterodimer with PcrB and comprises the active complex of perchlorate reductase. (Youngblut et. al.,2016).

BBa_K2695011
Coding
pcrB, pcrC, pcrD
Synthesised with B0034 ribosome binding sites in front each of the coding sequences for Azospira suillum pcrB, pcrC, pcrD. PcrC has a Flag-tag inserted at the C terminal. PcrD has an HA-tag inserted at the C terminal.  PcrB forms a periplasmic heterodimer with PcrA and comprises the active complex of perchlorate reductase. PcrC is a C-type cytochrome that connects the AB complex to the periplasmic membrane, allowing for electron shuffling. PcrD is predicted to be a molybdenum chaperone protein specific to assembling the pcrABC system. (Youngblut et. al.,2016)

Part Collection
Teams may use the parts in this collection to allow their chassis to reduce chlorite to chloride and oxygen, which might be useful for soil detoxification or O2 production where chlorite or perchlorate is present. For perchlorate reduction, the enzymes below must be used along with Perchlorate Reductase (see above) as that enzyme reduces ClO4- to ClO2-, which is the substrate that chlorite dismutase uses.
The 4 chlorite dismutase coding sequences in this collection are from 4 different species of bacteria. Exeter iGEM 2018 has shown, using a Western blot, that all coding sequences can be expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). As the four enzymes have different kinetic parameters, future teams can choose which enzymes best suits their specific chassis. Choosing the right enzyme, with the right kinetic parameters will allow teams to balance metabolic flux of intermediate substrates through pathways whilst avoiding overburdening cells with unnecessary enzyme expression.
