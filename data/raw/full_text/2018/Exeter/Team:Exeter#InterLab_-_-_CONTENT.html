The InterLab is the collaboration of iGEM teams to help identify and eliminate problems faced when sharing data between labs. Different instruments, such as plate readers, can give different results in different labs, despite following the same protocol. The question InterLab 2018 aims to answer is:</DIV><H3 class="quote" style="text-align:center;">“Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalising to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD?”</H3><DIV class="flex-container">Protocols:
The InterLab study was divided into four categories; cell absorbance, cell measurements, flow cytometry, and colony forming units. The calibrations under cell absorbance involved a Tecan Infinite 200 plate reader.</DIV><A name="Cell Absorbance" style="text-decoration: none;"><H2>Cell Absorbance:</H2></A><H4>Calibration 1: OD<SUB>600</SUB> Reference Point (LUDOX Protocol)</H4><DIV class="flex-container"><OL><B>Why?</B> To obtain a single reference point for converting absorbance (Abs<SUB>600</SUB>) into comparable OD<SUB>600</SUB> measurement.

For this part of the protocol, eight devices from the distribution kit were provided to transform into <I>E. coli</I> strain DH5α. These devices (BBa_R0040, BBa_I20270, BBa_J364000, BBa_J364001, BBa_J364002, BBa_J364007 BBa_J364008, and BBa_J364009) can be found in the iGEM directory. This process was split into a three day period; transforming, inoculation, and cell growth with assays. These cells were then grown to put through the FACS machine, in the final protocol for flow cytometry.

After the incubation of the two 96-well plates (0hrs and 6hrs), each sample was placed (146 in total) through a BD FACSAria III. Every well was pipetted into a plastic tube and read in the FACS machine. Each well had at least 10,000 events. The FCS files were then appropriately named - e.g.  Cell samples: [Exeter]_[0]h_[A3]_[Device1].fcs - and kept together in a zip folder.
