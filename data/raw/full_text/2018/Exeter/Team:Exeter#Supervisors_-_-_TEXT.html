We would not have gotten this far with our project without our supervisors. They guided us, taught us and, most importantly, showed us how to be independent. At the beginning of the summer no one would dare walk into the lab themselves - towards the end, it was not uncommon to see half the team in and out, like busy ants performing their individual tasks. It's safe to say all team members felt confident doing a protocol themselves, and being able to cope in a laboratory environment without any input.
We all owe them our thanks and gratitude for their time, patience and knowledge. They have improved us as a team, individuals and as scientists.
Professor John Love
Role: Chair of Synthetic Biology; Director of the Exeter Microbial Biofuels Group; Director of the BioEconomy Centre
Field of interest: Synthetic Biology and making the world a better place for the future
Fun Fact: Too many to mention; my life is multifaceted
Favourite part of iGEM: The most enjoyable aspect of supervising iGEM is the contact with students who, through their enthusiasm and commitment, are always going to be successful while having a lot of fun – they bring back the joy of science and discovery, and help me remember why I love my job.
Dr Chloe Singleton
Role: Research Fellow
Field of interest: Synthetic Biology and Biochemistry
Fun Fact: I am a Morris Dancer
Favourite part of iGEM: Over the past six years I have really enjoyed watching the Exeter iGEM teams developing their research projects and being able to test their ideas in the lab. The student’s enthusiasm for their projects has been an inspiration to all of us and I am proud to be an iGEM supervisor.
Dr Paul James
Role: Industrial Research Fellow
Field of interest: Synthetic Biology and Industrial Biotechnology
Fun Fact: I once represented England at Cricket
Favourite part of iGEM: Watching the students implement some of the most amazing ideas. It is amazing to see them work together to go from blank piece of paper to an amazing wiki, poster and presentation. iGEM has taken the lab into research areas we wouldn't have looked into and helped me grow as a scientist.
Dr Jamie Gilman
Role: Assistant Researcher
Field of interest: Synthetic Biology and Design of Experiments
Fun Fact: I'm a big cycling fan
Favourite part of iGEM: Seeing the range of completely different ideas that get pitched each year, and helping teams progress from ideas on a whiteboard to a final completed project
Dr Mark Hewlett
Role: Supervsior
Field of interest: Synthetic biology and cell free protein synthesis
Fun Fact: Always lies about favourite thing about iGEM
Favourite part of iGEM: Wiki freeze night!
Dan Barber
Role: Instructor
Field of interest: Molecular Biology
Fun Fact: I was part of the Exeter 2016 iGEM team
Favourite part of iGEM: I enjoy working with an interdisciplinary team and watching how students from different areas of science can change each other’s view of their own discipline
