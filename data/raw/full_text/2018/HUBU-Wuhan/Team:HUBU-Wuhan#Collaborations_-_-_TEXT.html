THE FIFTH CONFERENCE
OF CHINA IGEMER COMMUNITY
    “Among us, past, present and futuremeet. ”
    With excitement, the team members of the HUBU-Wuhan igem team boarded the train to Shanghai. For the reason of the experiment, we arrived at Shanghai Tech University  on the fourth day, the transparent glass appearance of the conference center, the delicious tea break time, the wonderful professional professors’ lectures all showed the organizer's intention.
    We walked into the classroom and listened to the presentation of TSINGHUA, iGEM Tianjin and other teams. We learned the application and development of synthetic biology in more fields which has broadened our thinking. In the evening， we came to shcool of life science and technology .We explained our projects to other teams. At the same time, in the process of communicating with other teams and answering questions, we also had new ideas for our projects. Sure enough, the communication collided with the spark of thought.
    By the next day, we started our own team’s presentation. Because it was the first team to show, it was a bit nervous a. At the Q&A session, students from other teams asked us questions about how to solve H2SO4 in the project. Our H2SO4 concentration is only 3% and is recycled. Next is the panel session hosted by Haotian Guo. Together with UESTC-China, Haotian Guo used his humor to successfully bring the atmosphere of the whole classroom, and joked that only 6 members of our team were a kind of newborn calf. The behavior is also a new idea.
    At noon lunch, we had dinner with HBUT.,communicated the projects of each team and HP progress, learned more forms of HP, and made iGEMers have a deeper friendship.
    This ccic trip, let us go out of the lab, get to know new partners, learn the advantages of other teams inpresentation, poster, etc., and appreciate the unique charm of synthetic biology, and let us have a new understanding about igem, about experiment, about personal growth . Goodbye to the fifth ccic, we will meet again in Boston.
Cooperation
with Hubei University of Technology
    We established a close relationship with two iGEM teams of the Hubei University of Technology and the Shandong University in China, respectively, on both experimental design and collaborative research.
    The Hubei University of Technology (HUBT) participated in the iGEM and won the Bronze Medal in 2017, which is in the same city, Wuhan, China with our university. Two formal meetings with HUBT were held in the Hubei University, with the first one on December 1, 2017, and the second one on July 13th, 2018. Besides, there are continuous communication along with the whole process of our iGEM project. In the first meeting, the mentor and captains of 2017 HBUT-iGEM team shared their iGEM experience with us, including the team assembly, project execution, and the problems they encountered. In addition, they also gave valuable suggestions of our proposed 2018 iGEM project to help us understand better of the iGEM concept. At the end of the day, both two teams agreed to communicate further to build a closer relationship. In the second meeting with HBUT-iGEM team, both the team discussed the current progress of the iGEM projects. The HBUT-iGEM team members were inspired by our project goal and achievements, emphasized the importance of the work on wiki, and suggested to enrich the biological parts of the iGEM registry with Zymomonas mobilis, a unique non-model industrial microorganism. He also mentioned.
Cooperation with Shandong University
    This year, Team SKLMT-China invited us to help testing their promoters in different laboratory condition. They construct a promoter library characterized by firefly luciferase to improve pseudomonas fluorescens pf-5. Since this is a brand-new chassis for us, the cloning method is significantly different from our teams, as well as the experimental conditions. Therefore, we discussed a lot during the cooperation in transformation methods. Even if there were some problems with the experiment result , we still learnt so much from each other and were so happy to cooperate with each other. It really enriched the experience of our team, a newborn calf 2018.
