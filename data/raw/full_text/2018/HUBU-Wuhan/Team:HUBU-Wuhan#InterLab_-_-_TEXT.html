    The HUBU-Wuhan iGEM 2018 team is participating in the Fifth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology.
Background
    Reliable and repeatable measurement is a key component to synthetic biology. One of the big challenges in synthetic biology measurement has been that fluorescence data usually cannot be compared because it has been reported in different units or because different groups process data in different ways. In the previous studies, the measurement committee showed that by measuring GFP expression in absolute fluorescence units calibrated against a known concentration of fluorescent molecule, we can greatly reduce the variability in measurements between labs. This year, we are invited to answering the following question: Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD?
