Laboratory Tour
    In order to get more students to be involved in the future iGEM projects, we gave introductory presentations in campus to freshmen and any students who are interested. On September 13, 2018, we arranged a class presentation to introduce the iGEM event and our iGEM projects to freshmen in the School of Life Sciences, followed by a questionnaire survey. Many students showed dense interests of the iGEM event and were encouraged by our iGEM project on solving the practical environmental problems in China.
    As a follow-up even of our class introductory presentation, we arrange a laboratory tour for the freshmen on September 27, 2018, to help them get more direct idea of how the iGEM project were performed in the laboratory. Laboratory safety was emphasized in the beginning, then lab instruments with some standard experimental operations were presented. Students were excited with the basic microbiology and molecular biology techniques used in our project, clearly showing interests in synthetic biology and its applications on changing the world.
Advice from Alumni
    To explain and broadcast our iGEM project to people from different groups such as our alumni and get their advice and inputs, we often invite them to attend our group meeting. On September 16, 2018, we invited Professor Jian Yang, professor of Shenzhen Vocational and Technical College, to listen to our report and give us suggestions.
    Prof. Yang is a distinguished alumnus of our school and the Secretary General of Shenzhen Alumni Association of Hubei University. Professor Yang and Shenzhen Alumni Association have been making significant contribution to the development of the School of Life Sciences and to the development of Hubei University including the establishment of the Scholarship Funding for outstanding students.
    After listening to our report, Professor Yang exhibited great interest in our project, and applauded the team members. He believed that such a competition is not only a training of scientific research skills for students, but also of scientific research spirit. He also gave advice on moving project forward.
