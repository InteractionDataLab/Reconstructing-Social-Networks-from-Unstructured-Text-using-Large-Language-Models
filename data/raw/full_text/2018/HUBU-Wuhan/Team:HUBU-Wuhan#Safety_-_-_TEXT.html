About our lab
 Q : 1.Have your team members received any safety training?
  A : Yes, we have already received safety training.
 Q : 2.Which work areas do you use to handle biological materials?
         Please check all that apply.
  A : Open bench/ Biosafety cabinet/ chemical fume hood.
 Q : 3.What is the biosafety Level of your lab?
  A : Level 1 (low risk).
    According to the requirements of iGEM policy, in our daily work we never performed any dangerous experiments or faced any unusual safety issues. Our laboratory followed some basic regulations as below:
    1.Food/drink is not allowed in laboratories where chemicals are used/ stored.
    2.Lab coats must be worn while handling corrosive, toxic, or flammable materials. Gloves must be worn when necessary, especially when handlingcorrosives, toxic and dangerously reactive materials.
    3.Short skirts, shorts, and open shoes must not be worn.
    4.The last person to leave the lab should make sure that water, electricity, gas, and air conditioner has been closed, and doors and windows has been locked before leaving.
    5.Know where safety equipment (eyewash, shower and extinguisher) is located.
    6.The experimenter must be trained before entering the laboratory and ,must keep in mind and follow the laboratory rules.
    7.Should not touch the power supply with wet hands or wet materials, water, electricity, gas should not be left before leaving the laboratory.
Project Design safety
    In our project, we use 2 kinds of organism,we will use E. coli as cloing host and the Gram-negative bacterium Zymomonas mobilis, a GRAS (Generally regarded as safe) strain, for biofuel production.They are Environmentally friendly strain of cell line wildly used in cell research. The product isobutanol is irritant and flammable, and the acid used for pretreatment is corrosive. Of course, our projects also have potential risk. Potential risk of plasmid transfter to other microorganism due to horizontal gene transfer. In response to this problem, we are also thinking about ways to actively solve.We will engineered the isobutanol production module into the chromosome and make the antibiotics gene cured to reduce the risk of plasmid transfter to other microorganism due to horizontal gene transfer.
    For more details, please look through our safety form.
