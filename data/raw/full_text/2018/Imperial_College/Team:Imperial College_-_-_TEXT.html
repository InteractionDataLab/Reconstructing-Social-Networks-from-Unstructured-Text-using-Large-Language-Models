Electronic Stimulation of Gene Expression
The more complex the system, the more control is required. PixCell introduces a new method of control to synthetic biology: electronic control.
“The most fruitful areas… of the sciences were… no-man's land between the various established fields” - Norbert Wiener
Electronic control circuits have provided us with the complex technology we use everyday of our lives. With PixCell we bring electronic control to synthetic biology. We also prove how it can provide the spatiotemporal control required for a key condition of biological complexity: patterning.
