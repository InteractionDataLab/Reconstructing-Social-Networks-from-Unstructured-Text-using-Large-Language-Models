Find here the complete growth curves and GFP expression profiles at increasing redox modulators concentrations. Due to computational unfeasibility of uploading all the plots as single images, these plots have been uploaded in GIF format. Time is on the x-axis, OD600 or GFP/OD600 on the y-axis and different concentrations of redox molecules as increasing time frames. If you are interested in the single curves at single concentrations, download the GIF to extrapolate the single images. If you are MAC user, once dowloaded, the file will be by default a collection of single images. If you are Windows user, extrapolate single images with an image processing software.
