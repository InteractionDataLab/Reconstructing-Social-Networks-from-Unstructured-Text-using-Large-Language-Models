PixCell Library
The PixCell library is the first ever library of electrogenetic parts. It contains 5 SoxR transcription factors and 8 pSoxS promoters capable of providing electronic gene induction. Parts were sourced from bacterial homologues or created by mutagenesis. Transcription factors and promoters were codon optimised for E. coli and promoters were engineered to be unidirectional, have upstream terminators for easy assembly, and have downstream ribozymes to reduce context dependency. All part combinations were characterised, exhibiting a range of RFU values with  a tunable orthogonal pair being identified. One mutant promoter we designed provided transcriptional repression, further increasing the complexity of electrogenetic circuits that can be constructed. All parts have been submitted in a BioBrick, BASIC and Golden Gate compatible format. Library parts were used to construct an electrogenetic biocontainment device whilst the systemâ€™s ability to sense oxidative stress offers extended-uses in various therapeutic, diagnostic and environmental applications.
