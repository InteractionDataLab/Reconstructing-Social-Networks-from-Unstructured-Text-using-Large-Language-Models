Achievements
During these months we worked, had fun, made new friends and also achieved great things.
Dry lab
- Developed an electrochemical model which simulates oxidised or reduced species being formed at and diffusing away from an electrode surface
- Developed a biological model which simulates the genetic response to the concentration of oxidised and reduced species on a single cell level
- Developed an integrated model and fitted it to experimental data to estimate absolute parameters of the electrogenetic system
- Designed and constructed an affordable electrode array to facilitate programmable spatial using the electrogenetic device.
- Developed a user-friendly phone application for remote control of patterning using the electrode array.
Wet lab
- Generated the first aerobic electrogenetic device in E. coli
- Optimised chemical conditions of the system to maximise the biological response of the electrogenetic device without significantly impacting cell viability.
- Proved this electrogenetic can provide fine spatial control of gene expression using a cheap electrode set-up.
- Created a library of electrogenetic parts for use in future electrogenetic project.
- Assembled the electrogenetic library into X different constructs using the next-generation BASIC assembly method, which were then characterised.
- Proved applications of electrogenetic devices in biocontainment and biomanifacturing.
- Found evidence of a new phenazine molecule as an inducer, which was suggested to exist in prior literature.
Human practices and outreach
- Proved molecules in the system could be replaced with safer alternatives following experts’ concerns of the toxicity of the system.
- Designed a Communinication Strategy Guide (CSG) to direct communication of our project with stakeholders
- Desined an interactive app (LTAT)  to foster communication of problems within a team
Collaborations
- Collaborated with 14 different teams from 7 different countries.
- Proved the part library can be used for alternative devices to electrogenetic systems with Oxford University.
- Ensured comparability of the part library with multiple assembly methods with Oxford University - Offer a proof of concept for the Valencia UPV Team project
BRONZE
criteria for bronze medal
✔ We registered for the Giant Jamboree and are excited to go there
✔ We contacted advisors, collaborators, sponsors and supporters and attributed their work on out attributions page Attributions
✔ We have submitted a comprehensive judging form and wiki and finalised our poster and presentation on time for the Jamboree. Judging form
✔ We improved gp2 T7 small protein ( BBa_ K1893019 ) characterisation using our electric activation system.
SILVER
criteria for silver medal
✔ We experimentally validated that our Pixcell construct ( BBa_ K2862021 ) works as expected producing GFP when voltage activated.
✔ We collaborated with teams from all around the world in bi-directional collaborations. We co-characterise our Sox library with Oxford iGEM 2018 team and organised a troubleshooting event for iGEM teams with other London iGEM teams (UCL, KCL, Westminster) among others. Collaborations
✔ We evaluated the impact of our project in society, the environment and safety by engaging in conversations with specialised and non specialised public and taking their advice into account to improve communication of scientific issues to the public, creating an interactive science communication guide. Human Practices
GOLD
criteria for gold medal
✔ We engaged in dialogues with possible stakeholders for our project and evaluated how to make a cheaper and safer technology using phenazine instead of pyocyanin. Integrated Human Practices
✔ We improved the existant bidirectional pSoxS/R promoter by creating a mutant ( BBa_K2862010 )that represses gene expression upon binding of the oxidised transcription factor instead of increasing it. Creating a new functionality for pSoxS/R promoters and giving more versatility to the Pixcell toolbox.
✔ We descriptively modelled the electrochemical reactions and the transcription/translation reactions that describe the function of Pixcell system. Modeling
✔ We developed Pixcell as a toolbox to generate localised spatial patterning and probed its feasibility in several applications including gp2 biocontainment. Results
