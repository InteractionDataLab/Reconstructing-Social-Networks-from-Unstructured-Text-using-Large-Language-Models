Joshua Lawrence
What is your nickname?
I am known as The Cheese Man, because I rate cheese
Why are you doing iGEM?
Because I love feeling like a genius and an idiot on alternating days
Notable quotes?
"We can't make Turing patterns!" and *Socialist screeching* in Middle English
Message to future iGEMers?
Be crazy, make Turing patterns
Lidia Ripoll-Sanchez
What is your nickname?
It’s Yaya, because I am the wisest in the team
Why are you doing iGEM?
Because it is an amazing competition that gives young students the freedom to work on their own projects at a professional level.
Notable quotes?
"Guys, let's have a meeting!"
Message to future iGEMers?
With enough enthusiasm and effort anyone can do iGEM. Just have fun, enjoy everyday, be super organised and follow the main iGEM rule: Trust your team!
Diellza Mujku
What is your nickname?
Dr. Mujku, since IDT thinks I've got a Ph.D
Why are you doing iGEM?
As it is a unique opportunity to work on a project of your own choice and as result a possibility to be creative and contribute to the field of synthetic biology as part of an amazing team
Notable quotes?
"Surely, if you do x, you'd be able to get y"
Message to future iGEMers?
Always plan ahead
Siwat Chang
What is your nickname?
Big. Don’t ask.
Why are you doing iGEM?
I needed a summer internship and iGEM sounded like fun. Also Bangkok is way too hot for any functioning human being to live in. กรุงเทพร้อนมาก!
Notable quotes?
"I'm working on it!", "Buenisimo!" and any of lyrics from Rasputin, Country Roads and Heyeayea (He-Man version)
Message to future iGEMers?
Be crazy, but plan your descent into madness one step at a time!
Alberto Scarampi del Cairo
What is your nickname?
”Guardian of Stochasticity”, “Plate Reader Master” or just Albi
Why are you doing iGEM?
Why wouldn't I?
Notable quotes?
"What is morality?", "But is it stochastic?" and "I need a coffee and a bueno"
Message to future iGEMers?
”Ye were not form’d to live the life of brutes, but virtue to pursue and knowledge high” [Dante Alighieri]
Luis Chaves Rodriguez
What is your nickname?
My friends may call me Luiso, Lucho and I gave myself the nickname of Lucha when I opened my twitter account back in 2008.
Why are you doing iGEM?
I find iGEM to be an amazing opportunity to learn about synbio (subject I’m fascinated about) but also about so many other things in life, like: working in a team, working as a team, organisation, creativity… and in addition to this, getting to share this experience with thousand of other students from around the world in Boston is what made me do iGEM this summer :)
Notable quotes?
"I'm not sure about the analogy is so powerful, on one side we show ethics by "protecting" people from GMOs and on the other side we compare this to restraining huge animals with higher cognitive abilities with an electric fence"
Message to future iGEMers?
When it comes to choosing a project don’t be afraid of thinking of very innovative ideas but also ideas that can have a significant impact and that can be as universal and modulable as possible. Foundational projects are very much needed in this baby stage of Synbio.
Thomas Caganek
What is your nickname?
Scooterboy - I come to the lab on a scooter.
Why are you doing iGEM?
Love to build cool stuff with biology and Jurassic Park - mainly Jurassic Park
Notable quotes?
"GG" and *Capitalist screeching* in German
Message to future iGEMers?
Work on projects that you find cool - the applications will follow and are hard to predict.
Yutong Yin
What is your nickname?
Yu
Why are you doing iGEM?
Because you get a chance to be creative and think of crazy ideas with a group of lovely people. win-win
Notable quotes?

Message to future iGEMers?
I loved iGEM, I think you will too.
Will Beardall
What is your nickname?
Handsome, cos why not.
Why are you doing iGEM?
Awesome CV building
Notable quotes?
"YEEEEEEEEEET" "It's a little bit finicky" "It be too easy" and *snaps his fingers to a finger gun

Work on quantum dots
Ph.D Supervisors
Amritpal Singh
What is your nickname?
The Guardian
Why are you doing iGEM (again!)?
iGEM was a great experience during my undergraduate, so much so that I did it twice. It would be a great opportunity to go from student to mentor and impart the spirit of iGEM into the young, fresh and naive minds of the following generation. Plus my supervisor said I have too.
Notable quotes?
"That's the thing right?"
Message to future iGEMers?
Run. Kidding. Synbios the future so develop the field, pass on the knowledge and enjoy being at the cutting edge and driving a field that’s full of some truly great minds.
Ismael Mullor Ruiz
What is your nickname?
Isma (mostly) and Rasputin (ocassionally)
Why are you doing iGEM (again!)?
I had previously taken part as a student in two iGEM teams and I found the experience rewarding at so many levels that I thought that having the chance to re-experience it in another role with the additional knowledge I had earned through some years was a chance that I could not miss
Notable quotes?
"Don't make questions if you are afraid of the answers"
Message to future iGEMers?
Be bold, but remember research is a long term enterprise. Beware of burnout and narcissists.
