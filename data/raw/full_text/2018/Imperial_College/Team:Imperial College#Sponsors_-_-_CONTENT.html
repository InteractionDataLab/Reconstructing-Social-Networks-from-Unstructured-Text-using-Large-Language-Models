The first production facility was located on the campus of the Radboud University in Nijmegen. After several years of growth the company needed more space to keep up with demands and moved to a new building.
This new building, still located in Nijmegen, offered the space we needed for expanding our endeavors. The product range has expanded from custom made oligonucleotides to highly modified oligonucleotides, fitted with every commercially available modification. Making them suitable for a wide range of applications including (Next Generation) Sequencing, PCR, Real-Time PCR, SNP detection, genotyping, gene expression and mutation detection.
Biolegio now has over 19 years of experience with the synthesis of oligos and has satisfied customers located all over the world. They use our products on a daily basis and benefit from our specialist knowledge within the field.</P1></DIV><DIV class="col"><P1>BMG LABTECH has been committed to producing microplate readers for more than twenty-five years.
