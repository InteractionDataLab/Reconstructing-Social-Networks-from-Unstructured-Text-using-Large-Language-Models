What is Human Practices
Designing a thoughtful iGEM project requires asking which problems synthetic biology can best help solve and exploring the impacts of your work in the world. At iGEM we believe these societal considerations should be upfront and integrated throughout the design and execution of synthetic biology projects.
Why are Human Practices Important?
Through the Human Practices elements of their competition, iGEM teams consider whether their projects are safe, responsible and good for the world. They creatively explore issues relating (but not limited) to the ethics, safety, security, and sustainability of their projects. These issues are complex and often do not have simple answers. Teams therefore conduct public engagement and dialogue; educating while inviting public input to shape the direction of their work.
