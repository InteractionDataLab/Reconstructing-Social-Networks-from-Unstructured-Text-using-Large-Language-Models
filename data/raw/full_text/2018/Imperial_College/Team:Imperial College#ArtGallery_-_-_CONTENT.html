                but it should also be about conveying emotion and inspiration to its audience. Sometimes words 
                are not enough to bring these emotions in others, and so we tried to approach science communication 
                through the alternate channel of art, where word are not necessary to invoke emotion. </P><P>We reached out to art students at the University of Arts London (UAL) Camberwell, 
                with whom we worked closely on helping the create art pieces that represent our project, 
                PixCell, in the context of the field of synthetic biology. Throughout the summer, 
                we contacted them regularly, answering any questions they may have, about our project 
            and the field of synthetic biology. From the artists, we asked that their work represent two key themes. </P><H3>Patterning In Nature</H3><P>We wanted the art pieces to highlight the importance of patterning in nature and biology, 
                especially as our project, PixCell, is about utilising electrogenetic control for creating biopatterns, 
                a necessary condition in evolution for the emergence of complex biological life. Through the pieces, 
                we want the audience to appreciate the presence and importance of patterns in nature, 
                something that we are used to seeing every day, and have overtime become too accustomed to. </P><H3>Patterning In Synthetic Biology</H3><P>We wished the pieces to present the significance of biopatterning to the field of synthetic biology in 
                trying to better mimic and understand natural systems. We also understand that the field of synthetic 
                biology has its controversies, where the reductionism of nature to controllable parts that we can manipulate 
                and experiment with at will can be revolutionary and awe-inspiring, but also alarming and unnerving. 
                We wished for the artists to be fair in their work and encouraged them to not shy away from the controversial 
                aspects of synthetic biology and to show a balanced image of synthetic biology.</P><H3>The Results</H3><P>In the end, we have four amazing pieces of art that beautifully convey the themes of biopatterning 
                and synthetic biology. These pieces are presented here in our digital art gallery for everyone to see online, 
                but we also took some of the pieces to New Scientist Live, where many visitors were intrigued and impressed 
                by the work, but furthermore, it helped many of them clearly see the significance of biopatterning and why 
                we are pursuing it through PixCell. This confirmed for us that the art collaboration was a success and has achieved its goal.</P><P>As well as New Scientist, we will be bringing the art pieces to the Giant Jamboree where we want to share them with the whole the 
                iGEM community and inspire others to also pursue art as a medium of science communication.</P><P>Scroll down to see the results of our art collaboration, and to find out more about our artists and their pieces.    </P><H2 style="margin-top:50px;">Our Artists</H2></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="container2"><H1>Francesca Hussey</H1><P><B>Emergence</B> Examining the notion of ‘Natural’ in the context of synthetic biology

                            (University of the Arts London) developing her path in art and design. Her works stretch across 
                            the fields of character design, storybook illustrations and 3D installations. She tends to layer 
                            her visuals with the use of metaphors, the game of illusions and everyday objects or situations that link 
                            her audience with the art piece. She also enjoys eavesdropping in conversations on public transport and running 
                            imaginary adventures with strangers in her head, a great source of inspirations and stories.

                    It is a representation of how synthetic biology explores and redefines the patterns of cells and 
                    the infinite possibilities of its development. By rotating the plates or the kaleidoscope, the moving 
                    visuals created inside can be beautiful or disturbing. This is the artist’s response to the both exciting 
                    and alarming potential of this technology.

                    communication and harmony within complex biological systems. Using old drawing techniques and 
                    manipulating the figures with modern software, an attempt was made to investigate the extremely 
                    rapid implementation of technology into the scientific work.
                    I drew pencil drawings inspired by old anatomy text books and combined them with
                    computer generated visuals that were originally microscopic images of fat tissue.

                            and displacement. Movement as agitation, movement as a transformative force 
                            generating new territories.

                    For this drawing I used various imageries found in magazines coming from nature, 
                    animals, micro-biology, fabrics, bones. I cut and assembled parts of the images to 
                    create a new organism, a hybridation made of elements that wouldn’t co-exist as part 
                    of the same body normally. I merged them together by the drawing process trying to draw 
                    patterns as small as possible with Indian ink and a nib. The relatively small scale of the 
                    patterns help to connect each part and give the impression of a harmonious creature 
                    half animal, half vegetal.
