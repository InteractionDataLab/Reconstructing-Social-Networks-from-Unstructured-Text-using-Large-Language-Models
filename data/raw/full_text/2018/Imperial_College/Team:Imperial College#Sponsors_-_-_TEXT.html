Arbor Biosciences is a development and manufacturing company owned by scientists founded to serve our peers in molecular biology applications.
BMG LABTECH has been committed to producing microplate readers for more than twenty-five years. By focusing on the needs of the scientific community, the company’s innovative microplate readers have earned the company the reputation of being a technology leader in the field. BMG LABTECH has developed a wide range of dedicated and multi-mode microplate readers for life sciences applications and high-throughput screening.
Biolegio was founded in 1996 in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. The first production facility was located on the campus of the Radboud University in Nijmegen. After several years of growth the company needed more space to keep up with demands and moved to a new building. This new building, still located in Nijmegen, offered the space we needed for expanding our endeavors. The product range has expanded from custom made oligonucleotides to highly modified oligonucleotides, fitted with every commercially available modification. Making them suitable for a wide range of applications including (Next Generation) Sequencing, PCR, Real-Time PCR, SNP detection, genotyping, gene expression and mutation detection. Biolegio now has over 19 years of experience with the synthesis of oligos and has satisfied customers located all over the world. They use our products on a daily basis and benefit from our specialist knowledge within the field.

Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT) is the supplier of custom nucleic acids, serving the areas of academic research, biotechnology, clinical diagnostics, and pharmaceutical development. IDT's primary business is the manufacturing of custom DNA and RNA oligonucleotides (oligos) for research applications.IDT's mission is to enable discovery in biology and medicine. The company strives to achieve this by improving nucleic acid synthesis technology and developing new applications for the use of DNA- and RNA-based compounds.
New England Biolabs (NEB) was established in 1974 by Donald Comb,  as a cooperative laboratory of experienced scientists, and initially produced restriction enzymes on a commercial scale. The company then began producing solution-oriented products.   NEB produces and supplies recombinant and native enzyme reagents for the life science research, as well as providing solutions supporting genome editing, synthetic biology and next-generation sequencing.NEB also provides free access to research tools such as REBASE, InBASE, and Polbase.                 The company runs free scientific databases. REBASE, the restriction enzyme database, contains the details of commercial and research endonucleases.
