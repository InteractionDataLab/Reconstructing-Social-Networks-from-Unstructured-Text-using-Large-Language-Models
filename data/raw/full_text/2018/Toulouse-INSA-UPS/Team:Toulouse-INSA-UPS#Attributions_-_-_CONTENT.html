It was not an easy ride but the help we received was better than we could have hoped for.</P><H2 id="general" class="heavy">General</H2><P>First of all, let‚Äôs start by thanking our amazing PIs and advisors for being with us from day one. They helped us on so much more than the scientific part of our project!</P><DIV class="tricolumn"><UL><LI><P><B>Sophie Barbe</B></P></LI><LI><P><B>Brice Enjalbert</B></P></LI><LI><P><B>Marie-Pierre Escudi√©</B></P></LI><LI><P><B>R√©gis Faur√©</B></P></LI><LI><P><B>Matthieu Guionnet</B></P></LI><LI><P><B>Anthony Henras</B></P></LI><LI><P><B>St√©phanie Heux</B></P></LI><LI><P><B>Pierre Millard</B></P></LI><LI><P><B>C√©dric Montanier</B></P></LI><LI><P><B>Yves Rom√©o</B></P></LI></UL></DIV><P>Let‚Äôs not forget <STRONG>Coraline Rigouin</STRONG> who was our advisor for a time but unfortunately did not stay until the finish line.</P><P>Where would our project be today if we didn‚Äôt have a place to experiment? For providing this for three months, a big thank you to the <STRONG>Biochemical Engineering Department of INSA Toulouse</STRONG>.</P><P>To get the best results in biology, you need an extra dose of luck, and if it is not enough, equipment is a must-have. For the latter, we would like to thank the <STRONG>LISBP</STRONG>, along with the <STRONG>GeT-Biopuce</STRONG> technological platform. They let us use their high-quality technological equipment such as their nano-dropper.</P><P>Finally, thanks to our predecessors, the <STRONG>2017 iGEM Toulouse INSA-UPS team</STRONG>, for mentoring us during the first weeks and for always being there when we had questions.</P><H2 id="artwork" class="heavy">Artwork</H2><P>A big thank you to <STRONG>Xavier Flenner</STRONG> for spending time working on our logo.</P><P>Thanks to <STRONG>Vincent Hoffmann</STRONG> and <STRONG>Julien Hypolite</STRONG> for working again this year on the second version of our cardgame, Microbioworld.</P><P>Finally, thanks to <STRONG>Alice Desprairies</STRONG> for the drawings of Sirius, Orthos and Cerberus for the team members page.</P><H2 id="communication" class="heavy">Communication</H2><P>Being students in the scientific field did not prepare us for the subtle arts of communication. Thus, we would like to thank <STRONG>Christelle Labruy√®re</STRONG> for advising us in this field, and the <STRONG>communication staff of our school (INSA Toulouse) and faculty (University Paul Sabatier)</STRONG> for giving us visibility.</P><P>Last, thanks to all the journalists who showed interest in our project and who wrote a newspaper article about us:</P><UL style="float: left;"><LI><P><B>B√©atrice Colin</B><I>(20 minutes)</I></P></LI><LI><P><B>Lucas Hueber</B><I>(La D√©p√™che)</I></P></LI><LI><P><B>Xavier Terrien</B><I>(Actu Toulouse)</I></P></LI></UL><H2 id="entrepreneurship" class="heavy">Entrepreneurship</H2><P>When we started our entrepreneurship approach, we received help from <STRONG>Guillaume Boissonat</STRONG>, the co-founder of a biotech start-up called <STRONG>pili.bio</STRONG>. He advised us on how to begin an entrepreneurship strategy and shared his experience as a start-up co-founder with us.</P><P>As our protein production began, we sought the help of <STRONG>Fran√ßoise Ouarne</STRONG>, the director of a biotech scale-up named <STRONG>CRITT-Bio-Industry</STRONG>, and she gave us advice on how to solve the problem of scaling up our production.</P><P>Finally, we collaborated with a business incubator named <STRONG>Le Catalyseur</STRONG> to build a strong entrepreneurship plan. For that, we were helped by <STRONG>Eric Marchadier</STRONG>, the director, <STRONG>Pierre-Emmanuel Hladik</STRONG>, the deputy director, and <STRONG>Nicolas Delcey</STRONG>, the incubator coordinator.</P><H2 id="human-practices" class="heavy">Human Practices</H2><P>We met <STRONG>Cathy Metge</STRONG> and <STRONG>Aur√©lien Despierris</STRONG> at an Escape Game convention, and they are both teachers in a STL high school, a specialized formation focused on Science and Laboratory Technology. Thanks to them and <STRONG>Philippe Garnier</STRONG>, an academic inspector who they introduced us to, we all worked together to find new ways to teach biotechnology by forming a collaboration between our team and the network of french high schools.</P><P>We intervened in a class composed of 35 CM1 (9 years old) children at the Belb√®ze primary school in Toulouse thanks to the invitation of their school principal, <STRONG>Laurence Millard</STRONG>.</P><P>Thanks to <STRONG>David Leromain</STRONG>, innovation manager of the <STRONG>1083 jean company</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Ren√© Jambon</STRONG>, director of the <STRONG>Prodhex company</STRONG>, for answering our questions about their perception of our project and how it could be used in the textile and medical industry.</P><P>During an event, we met <STRONG>David Faure</STRONG> who teaches at the <STRONG>International School of Toulouse</STRONG>. He was interested in our project and asked if we could present it in front of more than 200 students between the age of 11 to 19. To be able to present our project in front of such a broad public before the Giant Jamboree was a great experience for us. So, a big thank you to him for organising it, and to <STRONG>Carolyn Steinson</STRONG>, the school‚Äôs principal, and the other teachers for giving us the chance to be there.</P><P>We asked a good friend of Callum's, <B>Jackson Moore</B>, a level 2 Magic: the Gathering judge, for his opinion about Microbioworld. He gave us a few balance tips, but commented especially on the lack of a consistent structure of the cards. We redesigned them so that each type of card had a unified organisation, with the text box in the same area for example. Thank you for the tips!</P><H2 id="laboratory" class="heavy">Laboratory</H2><P>The first one we want to thank is our spiritual mom: <STRONG>Sylvie Cancel-Pfister</STRONG>. She is a technician at the Biochemical Engineering Department of INSA Toulouse and she did her best to help us every time she could.</P><P>Thanks to <STRONG>Idaline Chanteperdrix, Philippe Serp, Laurent Ropiquet and J√©r√¥me Volkman</STRONG> who work at the engineering school ENSIACET for helping us on the graphene and chemistry aspect of our project. They were kind enough to let us experiment in their laboratories and to lend us reactants such as graphene and carbon nanotubes.</P><P>For sharing his knowledge on the electroporator and for showing us how to use it, thanks to <STRONG>Thomas Lautier</STRONG> from the LISBP.</P><P>Thank you to <STRONG>Peter Schultz</STRONG> for sending us the <EM>Pichia pastoris</EM> GS200 strain, and two plasmids (pEVOL-AzF and pREAV-pFLD1-paPaRS).</P><H2 id="modelling" class="heavy">Modelling</H2><P>First, we would like to thank <STRONG>J√©r√©my Esque, Akli Ben Imeddourene</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Jelena Vucinic</STRONG> who are colleagues of our molecular modelling supervisor, Sophie Barbe, at the LISBP. They helped and advised us during our project, especially for parametrising the ligands attached to our Cerberus and using VMD!</P><P>Thanks to <STRONG>CALMIP</STRONG> for providing us with 100,000 hours of calculation, and to <STRONG>Nicolas Renon</STRONG> and <STRONG>Micka√´l Duval</STRONG> for training us.</P><P>Last, thanks to the <STRONG>Laboratory for Analysis and Architecture of Systems (LAAS)</STRONG> from the <STRONG>National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS)</STRONG> for exploring the intrinsically disordered regions of our protein with a robotics inspired AI. For further details, see our Modelling page.</P><H2 id="wiki" class="heavy">Wiki</H2><P>A huge thank you to <STRONG>Nathan Guiraud</STRONG> and <STRONG>Thibaud Laffargue</STRONG> for helping on the wiki during the last weeks before the wiki freeze.
