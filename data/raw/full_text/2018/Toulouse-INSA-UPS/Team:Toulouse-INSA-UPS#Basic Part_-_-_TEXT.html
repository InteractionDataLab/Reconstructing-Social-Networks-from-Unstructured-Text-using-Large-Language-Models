Parts Deposited On the Registry
Cerberus : A Molecular Binding Plateform (mSA2-CBM3a-AzF)
Figure 1: Part BBa_K2668010
This part consists on a CBM3a fused with mSA2, an engineered version of streptavidin and rhizavidin, on his N-terminus endogenous linker and containing a UAG codon on his C-terminus linker (amber stop codon) for the incorporation of the unnatural amino acid. Note that this part encodes the Cerberus platform if AzF is provided and the appropriate tRNA synthetase is expressed. Otherwise, it encodes for the Orthos construction.

Sirius: Cellulose-Binding Modules of Type 3a (CBM3a) Fused to mRFP1
Figure 2: Part BBa_K2668020
This part results in the fusion of the fluorescent protein mRFP1 to the cellulose binding domain CBM3a. The aim of this construction is to prove the binding of CBM3a to cellulose and to quantify it by fluorescence. Furthermore, the mRFP1 is visible to the naked eye and can therefore be used as a visual proof of concept.
