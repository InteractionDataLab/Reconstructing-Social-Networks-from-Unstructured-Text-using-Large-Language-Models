Parts Deposited On the Registry
Despite the large amount of parts contructed in our project (see below), we deliberately chose to submit only our validated functional parts to the registry.

Parts used on the project but not deposited on the registry
Scygonadin
Figure 1: Scygonadin construction
This part results in the fusion of scygonadin, an antimicrobial peptide from the mudcrab Scylla paramamosain, with an Avi-tag, a short peptidic sequence recognized by BirA in order to biotinylate proteins in vivo. It was used to prove the affinity of Cerberus to biotinylated compounds and to check if they keep their biological activity thereafter.     Scygonadin was planed to be produced in Pichia pastoris since it is an eukaryotic, microorganism, the production of an antibacterial peptide should not harm it.
mRFP1
Figure 2: mRFP1 construction
This part was used as a negative control for the affinity of Sirius towards cellulose. Its production was achieved under the exact same conditions as Sirius. The designed part was cloned into pET28 which includes an His-tag and can therefore allow us to purify it using cobalt column. It is always a pleasure to produce red proteins as it is very beautiful!
BirA
Figure 3: BirA contruction
BirA is the E. coli biotin ligase and has a high affinity for Avi-tag, a short peptidic sequence. It was co-expressed with mTagBFP and scygonadin for in vivo biotinylation. We used the pETDuet-1 for its production in E. coli. We got inspired by this system for the design of a double protein expression plasmid in Pichia pastoris for that we used the pPICZalpha to clone BirA into it and cloned the function to be biotinylated into the pGAPZalpha. Then we cloned the pGAP expression cassette (containing the CDS fused to an Avi-tag, a promoter and a terminator) .
Cerberus Tetrameric
Figure 4: Cerberus tetrameric construction
Cerberus was initially designed to use the classic tetrameric streptavidin, but we chose to also design a monomeric version using an engineered version. It was a good choice because the tetrameric version did not work...
No dogs were harmed over the course of this iGEM project.
