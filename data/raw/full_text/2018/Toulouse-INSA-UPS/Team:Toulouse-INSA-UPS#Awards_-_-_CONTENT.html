This achievement truly shows our investment in the Cerberus project. </P><P> Toulouse has succeeded in achieving a Gold Medal each year that it has participated in the iGEM Competition. We are proud to have upheld the reputation of this great team. We hope that our success will inspire future French iGEM Teams to do their very best as well.  </P></DIV><DIV class="tab-pane fade" id="Ach_part2" role="tabpanel"><H2 id="SpecialPrizes" class="heavy">Special Prizes</H2><H3 class="heavy">Best Basic Part</H3><P>A best new part should be fully characterized, have a touch of novelty, demonstrated efficiency, and should inspire the next generation of iGEMers. We think the Cerberus part matches this statement. It encodes a protein platform with three domains to link very different organic or inorganic molecules. We have proven its strong affinity for cellulose and the functionality of its streptavidin head, but its more impressive asset is its 4-azido-L-phenylalanine head, based on an unnatural amino acid which allows the grafting of any molecule with an alkyne function by click chemistry. The structure and dynamics of Cerberus were methodically modelled. We also demonstrated its efficiency to functionalize cellulose with fluorescence or magnetism, but its potential goes well beyond that since it virtually allows linking any molecule to any other, even cell polymers. We are very curious to see what the next iGEM teams will do with it! </P><P>Our convictions were confirmed, as we succeed in winning this special award! We are particularly proud of Cerberus, now certified to be the best dog by a panel of judges.</P><P style="text-align:right !important; font-size:1.2rem !important;"><EM>For more details, check out our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS/Basic_Part">Basic Parts page</A>!</EM></P><H3 class="heavy">Nomination: Best Manufacturing Project </H3><P>In recognition of our efforts on the project as a whole, we were nominated to receive the Special Prize for Best Manufacturing Project. This means a lot to us, as this track was very popular and featured many great projects!</P></DIV><DIV class="tab-pane fade" id="Ach_part3" role="tabpanel"><H2 id="Experience" class="heavy">Our adventure with iGEM</H2><P>On top of all these achievements, we earned something that can never truly be measured: friendship. From the very start, getting to know our team members at our first iGEM weekly meeting, up until the last day, talking with our poster neighbors and discussing projects with all the open-hearted and open-minded young (and less young!) scientists at the Jamboree.</P><P>For us, the Jamboree was never a place, but a people.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN><DIV class="container-fluid bg-secondary shadow-lg text-light" id="FOOTER"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-10 text-justify" id="FOOTER_CONTENT"><DIV id="DISCLAIMER"><I><P><I>No dogs were harmed over the course of this iGEM project.</I></P><P class="sponsor">The whole <B>Toulouse INSA-UPS team</B> wants to thank our sponsors, especially:</P><P class="sponsor">And many more.
