Escherichia coli vectors
pET28
The pET28 vector contains two His Tags in its MCS and is specified for protein expression at high yield. It gives the strain a resistance to Kanamycin and its replication origin is the pBR322 which is a mid - low copy number plasmid (~10). The vector used was a kind gift from IBCG library.
Figure 1. Map of the pET28 with the MCS Highligthed
pETDuet-1
The pETDuet-1 is, like the pET28, specialized in high yield protein production. Its main difference is that it contains two MCS and can therefore express two proteins at the same time under the same expression conditions. It bears ampicilin resistance and is a mid - low copy number plasmid. The plasmid used was a gift from IBCG library.

Pichia pastoris vectors
pPICZ alpha
The pPICZalpha is an integrative plasmid for Pichia pastoris protein expression and suitable for E. coli replication. Its MCS is suitable for protein expession using the methanol inductible AOX1 Pomoter (PAOX1)  and offering the alpha factor secretion signal for protein purification from culture supernatant. It contains a His tag and a Myc Tag for affinity purification stategies.

pGAPZalpha
The pGAPZalpha is roughly the same as the pPICZalpha with a different promoter that is the GAP Promoter, a glucose inductible promoter.

Autoclave both bottles to sterilize media and pour glucose solution in sterile conditions (next to a Bunsen burner or in a flow hood) into the second bottle.
Autoclaving glucose separately from amino acids avoids Maillard reaction, which can result in the formation of toxic byproducts in the media.

LB agar plates containing your favourite antibiotic
IPTG 1M (~1ml)
Talon Buffer 1x 10mM Imidazole
Protocol
Day one :
Transform your plasmid in E. coli BL21(DE3) competent cells plate on LB Agar + Your favourite antibiotic and incubate O/N at 37°C
Day two :
Pick 3 colonies and seed then in 9ml LB + Your favourite antibiotic. Incubate O/N at 37°C under 130 rpm shaking.
Autoclave 800ml LB 10 g/L NaCl in a 2L baffled flask and preheat it at 37°C O/N.
Day three:
Take a sample of the 800ml culture and measure OD600 as blank.
Take 1ml of preculture and measure OD600, seed the preculture in the 800ml LB and take OD.
Calculate OD600 assuming that it doubles every 20 minutes and check the OD until it reaches 0.5 ~0.6. Once the exponontial phase is reached, induce with 800µl of 1M IPTG stock solution and incubate at 37°C for 4h or O/N at 16°C.
Pellet cells by centrifugate at 5000 x g for 10 minutes and resuspend in 10ml TB 1x 10mM Imidazole if growth was performed at 37°C of 10ml of O/N.
Freeze cells for later purification or wait at least 30 minutes to continue the protocol.
Sonication :  Run on cycle of 1 minute and one of 30 seconds, both at 25 of intensity.
Pellet cells by centrifugate at 60,000 x g for 30 minutes and withdraw the supernatant that is the cell free extract.
Then continue to the protein purification protocol.
2. Protein production - Pichia pastoris
Expression can be done in either YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or Yeast Nitrogen Base with 0.5% glucose.
Using a single colony, inoculate 10 ml of YPD. Grow at 28–30°C in a shaking incubator (250–300 rpm) O/N.
Use 0.1 ml of the overnight culture to inoculate 50 ml of YPD in a 250 ml flask. Grow at 28–30°C in a shaking incubator (250–300 rpm).
At each of the times indicated below, transfer 1 ml of the expression culture into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. These samples will be used to analyze expression levels and determine the optimal time to harvest. Centrifuge at maximum speed in a tabletop microcentrifuge for 2–3 minutes at room temperature.
Time points (hours): 0,24 (1 day), 48 (2 days), 72 (3 days) 96 (4 days)
For secreted expression, transfer the supernatant to a separate tube. Store the supernatant and the cell pellets at –80°C until ready to assay. Freeze quickly in liquid N2 or a dry ice/ethanol bath.
For intracellular expression, decant the supernatant and store just the cell pellets at –80°C until ready to assay. Freeze quickly in liquid nitrogen or a dry ice/ethanol bath.

Add 40 ml of ice cold H2O and vortex every 10ml
before adding the last 10ml vortex hard
Centrifugate at 10,000 x g for 20 minutes and discart supernatant.
Wash with 45ml of H20 and 0.5ml of Na2CO3 2M
Repeat 4 times
Resuspend in 20 ml of Water to a final concentration of 10mg/ml
2 . 2 . CBM protein purification : Cellulose affinity
Material
Cell Free Extract
Regenerated Amorphous Cellulose
Ethylene Glycol
RAC previously prepared
Method
Add 5ml of RAC (10g/L) to the Cell Free Extract, volumes can be scaled up depending on the production yield required. Mix by inverting and incubate 30 minutes at room temperature.
Centrifugate 4 500 x g for 20 minutes. Collect supernatant as Flow Through fraction. Resuspend pellet with 5 RAC Volume of 50mM Tris HCl pH 8.
Centrifugate at 4 500 x g for 20 minutes and discart supernatant, repeat twice
Resuspend pellet in 2 RAC Volumes of 100% Ethylene Glycol and let sit for 15 minutes.
Centrifugate at 4 500 x g for 20 minutes, Supernatant can be conserved at 4°C or -20°C depending on the usage required.
Analyse by SDS PAGE.
3 .Protein concentration using vivaspin column
Materials
Vivaspin column
Protocol
Add your favourite purified protein (Dont go over 20ml) and equilibrate with and empty tube willed with water (DO NOT DISCART AFTER) and centrifugate for 5 minutes at 4500 x g. Observe the eluted volume and adapt the time for the desired final volume (this is protein dependant).
4 . Desalting protein using PD-10 column
Remove the top cap and cut the sealed end of the column
let the storage solution elute
Fill the column with the equilibration buffer (the one you will want your protein to be recovered in
Repeat 4 times
Discart the Flow Through
(Around 25ml should be used in total)
Add max 2.5 ml of the sample to the column and let it enter completely
If sample volume is less than 2.5ml add equilibration buffer to complete AFTER the sample has entered the column completely
Discart the flow through
Place a collection tube and elute with 3.5ml buffer.
If larger volume are needed to be concentrated repeat initial Equilibration step before adding another one.
Characterization
Cellulose pull down assay
Material
Regenerated Amorphous Cellulose 10 mg/ml
50mM Tris HCl pH 8
Protein sample (concentration about 5mg/ml)
Ethylene glycol
RAC previously prepared
Method
Prepare solutions following these amounts :
75µl Tris HCl pH 8
100µl RAC
4µl protein sample (prepare negative control by replacing it with water)
21µl H20 mQ (can aslo be replaced with protein for saturating the RAC)
Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes
Centrifugate at >10,000 x g for 10 minutes
Collect supernatant fraction
Wash with 5 x RAC Volume of Tris HCl
Centrifugate at >10,000 x g for 10 minutes
Eluate protein with 2 x RAC Volume of Ethylene glycol
Analyse different fractions by SDS PAGE.
Strain Promoted Alkyne Azide Cycloaddition
Method
Add in 100μL a ratio of 1:10 of Azide:DBCO, cover with aluminium foil and incubate O/N under shaking
