LABBOOK
To achieve our lab work, we split up into different teams, each working on different aspects of the experimental procedure. Three teams were then formed :
Team coli: this team was managed by Younes and included Marion. Their goal was to achieve the production and characterization of Cerberus and Sirius in Escherichia coli
Team pastoris: this team was ruled by Angeline and included Ga√´lle. Their mission was to reproduce the experiments planned on Escherichia coli in Pichia pastoris
Team biotin: this team was ruled by Amandine and included Jean and Julien. Their objective was to construct and to test our in vivo biotinylation system.
Team callulose: this team was managed by Callum (and so was dubbed Callulose) and got help from Younes. Its mission was to launch and optimize our bacterial cellulose production.
LABBOOK: JUNE
18/06 - 22/06:
For the first week in the lab, we received and amplified our plasmids (pPICz, pETDuet, pET28, pGAP) but also our bacterial strains E. coli BL21 DE3 and Tuner.
25/06 - 29/06:
Team coli: we started with a PCR on the the gBlock Cerberus-pastoris. In order to clone this gBlock, we prepared the pGAP plasmid by amplifying it in E. coli Stellar cells before a Midiprep. Another aspect was to check the pREAV which will allow the incorporation of a unnatural amino acid in our Cerberus.
Team pastoris: pPIC, pGAP and pETDuet were good but pPIC did not match our expectations so we had to find another solution.
Team callulose: the first productions of cellulose started in culture tubes.
LABBOOK: JULY
02/07 - 06/07:
Team biotin: this week, we performed a PCR on BirA and we digested the pPIC after its amplification in E. coli Stellar cells. This allowed us to do our first cloning with BirA in the pETDuet. We checked the clones by digestion and they were OK. It was necessary to sequence these clones before doing the next cloning in  pETDuet. We obtained a different pPIC from a previous year's supplies, and we checked it.
Team coli: this week, it was the first In-fusion cloning with our Cerberus in the pET28. We used two differents construction for Cerberus, one with a monomeric streptavidin and another with a  tetrameric streptavidin. Then, we checked the constructs by digestion before sending them for sequencing. In the same time we checked our plasmid pEVOL-AzF which allows the unnatural amino acid incorporation in E. coli.
Team pastoris: this week, we clone Cerberus-streptavidin though In-fusion  into the pGAP with the material prepared the week before. So we had to check some clones by digestion before sequencing. Fortunately, they were good. It was also this week that we received the Pichia pastoris GS200 strains cell.
09/07 - 13/07:
Team biotin: on monday we sent our pETDuet BirA clones obtained last week to sequencing and we were happy that our clones were validated. In the same time, we carried on the PCRs with the parts that will be used to functionalize our Cerberus after biotinylation by BirA.
Team coli: This week, we received the sequencing results for Cerberus and it was again a success for the Toulouse iGEM team. We cloned Sirius (CBM3-RFP) in the pET28 with the In-fusion kit. For this, we performed PCR on the gBlocks then we used the In-fusion kit. After verification, Sirius was OK.
Team pastoris: we checked the pREAV and found out the plasmid map didn‚Äôt match with our digestion results. We needed to find a different pREAV...
Team callulose: we decided to focus the production with G. hansenii because it produces more cellulose than K. rhaeticus. We also started production in 2L Erlenmeyers.
16/07 - 20/07:
Team biotin: This week, we focused on the pastoris cloning. We prepared the pGAP vector (amplification, purification and digestion), mRFP1, BFP and scygonadin parts and we cloned all three. We tried to amplify and purify pPIC but unfortunately it was necessary to try again because the Midiprep didn‚Äôt succeed.
Team coli: this week, we made or own competent cells using BL21 DE3 and tuner strains
Team pastoris: this week, we did In-fusion cloning in the pGAP but this time with the cerberus mSA2. After transformation, culture and miniprep, we checked clones by digestion. The cloning was a success.
23/07 - 27/07:
Team biotin: this week, before another midiprep, we checked the pPIC but we still had a mapping problem. After many verifications, it was clearly not correct but we found another source for this plasmid and it seemed OK. We amplified it by midiprep.
Team coli: this week, we did the first production assay for Sirius and we were very happy because we obtained a red culture medium.
Team pastoris: this week, the pichia team helped the other teams because it was ahead of the planning and had to wait for yeast growth.
30/07 - 03/08:
Team biotin: this week, we worked on pETDuet-BirA to clone our functionalizing proteins (mRFP1 and BFP). We amplified the pETDuet-BirA and after Midiprep and digestion, we cloned mRFP1 and BFP with the In-fusion kit. After digestion, we sent clones to sequencing and started production assay in E. coli BL21 DE3.
Team coli: we did the first Sirius purification after production in E. coli BL21 DE3. To do this, we used an IMAC column and dialysis. In order to prove the CBM3 fixation to cellulose, we prepared the regenerated amorphous cellulose.
Team callulose: We intensified the cellulose production to be able to give 5g of dried cellulose to the Bordeaux iGEM team at the end of the month.
LABBOOK: AUGUST
06/08 - 10/08:
Team biotin: this week, we worked on the production assay for biotinylated proteins in E. coli. Furthermore, we cloned BirA in the pPIC plasmid and we checked it by digestion and sequencing. After that, we cloned RFP, scygonadin and BFP in this plasmid to produce the proteins in Pichia pastoris.
Team coli: in order to show the efficiency of the second Cerberus head, we needed a Cerberus which has just its CBM3a head and the streptavidin head. We did a directed mutagenesis on the stop codon to create Orthos.
13/08 - 17/08:
Team biotin: we produced biotinylated proteins with E. coli, with and without biotin in the culture medium.
20/08 - 24/08:
Team coli: this week was a particularly busy week. We produced and purified Orthos as well as for Sirius and mRFP1. This allowed us to perform a cellulose pull down assay with Sirius and mRFP1 as a negative control. In addition, we produced Cerberus. To do this, we  co-transformed BL21 DE3 cells with pET28 Cerberus and pEVOL AzF. The cell culture medium was complemented with the AzF unnatural amino acid to allow its incorporation. Cerberus was purified by a cellulose pull-down assay.
Team pSB1C3: we created this new team to start the pSB1C3 clonings. PCRs were performed on our gBlocks. Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt manage to amplify all the gBlocks.
27/08 - 31/08:
Team coli: in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the third Cerberus head, we did a click assay with DBCO-fluorescein.
LABBOOK: SEPTEMBER
03/09 - 07/09:
Team coli: in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the AzF head, we tried to click paramagnetic beads on it. The aim was to see the movement of cellulose in a presence of a magnet
Team pSB1C3: this week, we tried the pSB1C3 clonings again. We used another pSB1C3 and tried a classic cloning with restriction enzymes instead of In-fusion. At the end of the week, we sent our pSB1C3 for sequencing.
10/09 - 14/09:
Team biotin: we successfully pulled Orthos down to measure the BFP fluorescence with and without Orthos on cellulose.
17/09 - 21/09:
Team biotin: this was the final assay and we proved the fixation of the biotinylated BFP on Cerberus.
24/09 - 28/09:
Team coli & callulose: for our last lab week, we managed to produce a pink bacterial cellulose by using our purified Sirius protein.
