This project is definitively ambitious and likely to have broad implications in people's everyday lives. As such, human practices were the bedrock of our efforts (Figure 1).</P><FIGURE class="figure" style="text-align:center;"><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption"><STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG><I>Topology of the human practices during the Cerberus project</I></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>First, public and professional needs for such new materials were explored to refine our project. We also investigated their expectations and fears about biotechnologies and what functionalised cellulose could change for them (we also answered the same questions as did fellow iGEMers from Canada and Singapore!). Since we are not full-time scientists (yet!), we needed help from synthetic and structural biologists, chemists and specialists in biotechnologies to choose the best approaches. With this key information, we defined an ethical matrix to identify the most challenging societal issues of our project. All these considerations were used to conceive and to position our project. </P><P>We are truly convinced tomorrow's fabrics will be functionalised (for clothes and more). For us, iGEM is only a first step and we are therefore committed to a detailed entrepreneurship effort. We sought help from companies to ensure the relevance of our manufactured products on the market, and from business developers to go beyond science and processes and move our project towards becoming a start-up. </P><P>Last but not least, we engaged deeply in educational efforts since it was clear from our Integrated Human Practices that only knowledge could help people to understand and accept our innovation. We used educational visits on local and national scales involving children, high-schoolers and the general public to explain what we do, how we do it and why we do it.</P></DIV><DIV class="tab-pane fade" id="IHP" role="tabpanel"><H2 class="heavy">INTEGRATED HUMAN PRACTICES</H2><P>The Cerberus project was designed to offer countless new possibilities for cellulose functionalisation and beyond, so that it should impact a lot of people in their everyday lives. Our first priority was therefore to meet these people and talk over their fears and expectations and orientate our project accordingly. We conducted interviews with manufacturers and created surveys for both professionals and end-users. We also compared our visions of biotechnologies with those of fellow iGEMers from different continents. A very important point was to talk with experts about what we intended to do. Cerberus is a blend of chemistry and synthetic biology so these discussions were absolutely necessary for the project design. Last but not least, we created an ethical matrix to define how our project could impact society and the environment. Clearly, the IHP was not a subtask of the Cerberus Project but the main reason of its success.</P><DIV id="NOTEBOOK_tab_Group"><UL class="nav nav-pills d-flex flex-row flex-wrap flex-lg-nowrap justify-content-around justify-content-lg-start" role="tablist"><LI class="nav-item"><A class="nav-link btn btn-secondary rounded-top corner-bottom mr-1 active" data-toggle="pill" href="#HP_Part1" role="tab" style="color:white !important;">Interviews</A></LI><LI class="nav-item"><A class="nav-link btn btn-secondary rounded-top corner-bottom mr-1" data-toggle="pill" href="#HP_Part2" role="tab" style="color:white !important;">Surveys</A></LI><LI class="nav-item"><A class="nav-link btn btn-secondary rounded-top corner-bottom mr-1" data-toggle="pill" href="#HP_Part3" role="tab" style="color:white !important;">Individual Thoughts</A></LI><LI class="nav-item"><A class="nav-link btn btn-secondary rounded-top corner-bottom mr-1" data-toggle="pill" href="#HP_Part4" role="tab" style="color:white !important;">Expert's Advice</A></LI><LI class="nav-item"><A class="nav-link btn btn-secondary rounded-top corner-bottom mr-1" data-toggle="pill" href="#HP_Part5" role="tab" style="color:white !important;">Ethical Matrix</A></LI><LI class="nav-item"><A class="nav-link btn btn-secondary rounded-top corner-bottom mr-1" data-toggle="pill" href="#HP_Part7" role="tab" style="color:white !important;">HP Worldwide</A></LI><LI class="nav-item"><A class="nav-link btn btn-secondary rounded-top corner-bottom mr-1" data-toggle="pill" href="#HP_Part6" role="tab" style="color:white !important;">LogBook</A></LI></UL><DIV class="tab-content"><DIV class="tab-pane fade show active" id="HP_Part1" role="tabpanel"><H2 class="heavy">INTERVIEWS</H2><P> We first investigated how manufacturers that could potentially incorporate the Cerberus technology felt about our project. We chose two different companies: 1083, a jeans producer, and Prodhex, a bandage producer. Interestingly, they both highlighted some suspicions about biotechnologies, but these suspicions were secondary as long as biotechnologies can bring innovations, improve product sustainability or have a lesser impact on the environment. These were important aspects for us to take into consideration for the Cerberus project </P><H3 class="heavy">OUR APPROACH</H3><P> We chose to conduct interviews in order to discuss their work, our project and biotechnologies freely. </P><H3 class="heavy">INTERVIEWS SYNTHESIS </H3><H3 class="heavy">1083 Interview</H3><P><I>David Leromain, Innovation Manager, August 13th 2018</I></P><OL><LI>Presentation of the 1083 Company</LI><P>1083 is a trademark of the company Novetex. It was founded in 2007 by a computer
                                manager who wanted to cange direction and focus on the sale of ecological clothing. The founder
                                wanted to create his own business. He chose jeans because of the universality of this garment
                                (beyond nationalities, religions, ages, etc). Jeans are also linked to French industry with
                                the original N√Æmes canvas. 1083 then diversified by offering sneakers, bermudas, skirts and shorts.
                                The question of what was possible to do in France then arose. A first consideration was
                                the economy. Many companies in the textile industry use a large number of subcontractors,
                                which entails considerable additional costs. 1083 minimizes the number of intermediaries
                                (manufacturers, brand and reseller) by turning toward a traditional eco
                                responsible economic model, and French manufacturing.
                                </P><LI>Current operation</LI><P>Jeans are complex products that are produced in several stages: cotton harvesting,
                                spinning, dyeing, weaving, design and finishing. Once manufactured, the jeans are
                                sold and used, then discarded or recycled. Cotton growing is one of the few stages in the
                                production of the product that 1083 is forced to do abroad. In fact, the French climate is not
                                compatible with this type of culture.</P><P>Cotton spinning makes it possible to obtain a ribbon which will be transformed into thread.
                                The longer the fibers, the more resistant the wire will be. Traditionally, jeans are made using
                                blue yarn, dyed with indigo (the natural color of cotton being white). The next stage, weaving, makes it possible to produce fabric from yarn. When weaving, the thread has to be taut.
                                Engraving allows the raw canvas to stabilize. The fabric is wetted and then heated
                                between two rolls. When wet, the plant fibers are compressed which makes the fabric shrink.
                                Once dry and leaving the rollers, the fabric is then stretched to make it regain its initial
                                size. Then comes the cutting of the fabric, the assembly of the different parts and 
                                mounting of the accessories. Value can be added back to the raw material itself by recycling. Jeans can
                                be converted into Bermuda shorts or shorts for example. The fabric can also be used as
                                insulation or as fuel.
                                </P><LI>Our innovation</LI><P>Although organic cotton reduces the environmental impact due to the absence of pesticides,
                                it is very water-hungry, as is the fixing of indigo. Using bacterial cellulose could reduce this
                                ecological impact. When spinning, uniform yarn quality has to be maintained, thus different
                                arrivals of cottons are mixed and spun together. Bacterial cellulose has the advantage
                                of being of constant quality because the entire production environment is perfectly
                                controlled.</P><P>The dyes used by 1083 create problems because the color of the jeans does not fade.
                                However, this is a characteristic of jeans that is sought by consumers. The molecules used for
                                our project risk, on the contrary, being fixed only to the superficial part of the thread and be very
                                quickly unhooked during jeans use which would cause the desired colour loss.
                                Textile produced by bacteria without cotton could be interesting as it remains clean
                                and ecological. On the other hand, we must try to think about the recycling of the material.
                                </P></OL><H3 class="heavy">Prodhex Interview</H3><P><I>August 20th 2018</I></P><OL><LI>Presentation of the Prodhex Company</LI><P>Prodhex is a company founded by Ren√© Jambon in 2002 as a first aid specialist. It offers emergency kits, bandages and many 
                                types of dressings. They supply mainly French firefighters but also the medical emergency services, the French Red Cross or pharmacists.</P><P>We were able to get an interview with the current director Mr. Jambon who was able to present the operation of his company to us and give us his opinion on our project. 
                                </P><LI>Current operation</LI><P>Medical products are subject to a great deal of control when produced and sterilized.
                                That's why the Prodhex Company takes special care in the production of its dressings,
                                bandages and emergency products. The roll of fabric that will be in contact with the wound
                                may be spun, non-woven, plastic or adhesive. Fabric rolls (60 to 80 m) are placed in an
                                oven, then the glue is added onto the fabric. The rolls are then rolled up with adhesive
                                and cut (5 to 10 cm depending on the dressings). Once cut, the dressing will be equipped
                                with a central or complete compress. In the case of strips of 1m * 6m, the compress is
                                continuous and cut every meter. Finally, sterilization is performed by using gamma rays.
                                The most sensitive part is the precise placement of fabric for cutting but also gamma
                                sterilization.
                                </P><LI>Our innovation</LI><P>After discussing our Cerberus protein and its fixation on dressings, Mr. Jambon told us that
                                our product was part of the current industry. Our protein would cause less risk for the patient
                                but also for the environment. Indeed the current fixing techniques are chemical and can be
                                corrosive for example. The areas of healing and antibiotics are developing rapidly and need to
                                attach directly to the dressing in a less harmful way for example.

Here, the complexity was that Cerberus offers a multiplicity of applications. We therefore decided to focus on one application and chose the medical field as we thought it would be the most sensitive application. More specifically, we questioned our population sample on how antibiotic-functionalised dressings could be of help in their daily life. We also directed our survey towards both practicians and patients, since their point of view could be different.</P><H3 class="heavy">Practician survey</H3><P>Our first questions were asked to get to know our 51 practicians. Despite the fact that most of them were still students (Graph 1), there were also nurses and lifeguards in our population samples. Hence, the majority of them already have more than a year of experience with patients (Graph 2) and they regularly use band-aids (Graph 3).</P><P>Now, the most important questions were about our project. We explained to each of them what we were doing and why, then we asked two concise questions. The first one was about which benefit could be gained from antibiotic-functionalised cellulose in their dressings using Cerberus (Graph 4). They had to give a score from 1 (no benefit at all) to 10 (huge befits). Their evaluation was very positive for this application of Cerberus with 49 persons out of 51 thinking this will be an improvement. The second question was more global and about the interest of the Cerberus project for the society (Graph 5). Here again, the results clearly demonstrated a strong interest for the possibilities brought by Cerberus.</P><H3 class="heavy">Patient survey</H3><P>First, it was more difficult to interview patient than we had expected. For most of them, this was felt to be an intrusion in their privacy and they did not agree to be observed and questioned during treatment. Our population sample is therefore small (9 people) and conclusions should be considered with reservations. Another consequence is that our population was young (around 20 for most of them; Graph 1), likely because young people were most receptive to what we were investigating. In any case, this is another bias for this survey.</P><P>We enquired about their needs for dressings and their feelings about them. Most of them were suffering from a wound (Graph 2) and needed dressings for a week or two (Graph 3). Interestingly, the dressing is often perceived as a source of discomfort (Graph 4) and about half of them were worried about changing it (Graph 5). Clearly, this means that new solutions reducing treatment duration or frequency will be a relief for the patients.</P><P>We then explained our project and asked if they thought that Cerberus could help to improve the dressing treatment they needed. The results (Graph 6) clearly indicate that their appreciation of our product is positive. The last question was more general about how Cerberus and its many applications could be relevant for society. Again, the responses were still in a range from positive to very positive, however with less enthusiasm than for the first question, probably because in their situation, improving dressings was their top priority.</P><H3 class="heavy">Other comments</H3><P>We also included the possibility to make additional comments in the survey and there were some very interesting suggestions of new applications using Cerberus:</P><UL><LI><P>Molecule to heal burns and moistening products</P></LI><LI><P>Antifungal molecules</P></LI><LI><P>Hemostatic molecules</P></LI><LI><P>Anti-odor molecules</P></LI><LI><P>Fibrinogenic or anti-fibrinogenic molecules</P></LI></UL><P>There was also a very smart suggestion to create dressings with different localized properties depending on the position (for example, favoring epithelialization on the side and antifibrinogenic in the center). </P><H3 class="heavy">Conclusion</H3><P>These surveys clearly showed that new functionalities for cellulose could have very desirable applications in the medical sector. There are real needs from both patients and practicians. We had very exciting feedback and very interesting suggestions to improve our project. Finally, the interest for Cerberus goes beyond medical applications and nearly all the people we asked  believe in a wide importance of this project for society.</P></DIV><DIV class="tab-pane fade" id="HP_Part4" role="tabpanel"><H2 class="heavy">EXPERT'S ADVICE</H2><P>The Cerberus project was very ambitious, even from the start. Somehow, it was not one project but several since we decided to tackle several problematics but with one universal solution. This universality came at a cost since grafting organic and inorganic molecules is a very different challenge. For organic ones, we had synthetic biology with us. But for inorganic one, the challenge was to gather biology and chemistry, the latter being, at the start of the project, a big unknown field for us. We therefore had to explain our project to international and national experts, get their feedbacks, and integrate it in our design. Here are some of the most important ones for us.

														Given the central role of the Cerberus platform in our project, building of a three-dimensional structural model of this macromolecular ensemble was crucial. Due to the absence of experimental data, the modeling of some parts was challenging. Thus, parameters were built for AzF and 3D structure prediction and conformational sampling  methods were used for the junctions between CBM3a and the other heads (linkers).  It must be noticed that linkers are known in the literature to be highly flexible and disordered, meaning that these regions must be correctly sampled. Because these tasks required specific knowledges, we had the assistance of Jeremy Esque (INRA Research Engineer at the Toulouse LISBP) as a specialist in structural bioinformatics. His skills in protein 3D structure prediction techniques and conformational sampling and exploration methods  have been an invaluable asset to our project.

													Our first idea was to produce functionalised cellulose <I>in vivo</I>. So we aimed to produce Cerberus and its associated function with the yeast <I>Pichia pastoris</I> in a bioreactor.  We had a long discussion about this with Christine Lafforgue. She is a specialist in fermentation process and her insight was invaluable to our project since it avoided us a lot of difficulties. Indeed, it came out from our discussion that cellulose production in a bioreactor was very risky and required tangential flow filtration to maintain a productive system. We therefore reshaped our project and put most of our strength in a <I>E. coli</I> driven production with subsequent purification. <I>In vivo</I> production is still a possibility for Cerberus, but it was no more a priority and the results proved it right.

First meeting with Le Catalyseur which is a pre-incubator helping students in the field of entrepreneurship. A very interesting discussion took place between Nicolas Delcey, Eric Marchadi√© and Pierre-Emmanuel Hladik. To adapt our final product to the market, we thought it would be easier to have our Cerberus produced by subcontractors that we would advise. So we started looking for protein-producing companies to deepen our entrepreneurial approach.

We did half a day of entrepreneurial coaching with Nicolas Delcey. Thus, we made an inventory of the project developments and we worked on the identification of the risk factors (probability and their potential impact on our project). This allowed us to proudly identify all the tasks and efforts made since the beginning of the project.

It is therefore mandatory to any project to foresee its possible consequences, especially for one that claims to offer endless possibilities. To do that, we chose an ethical matrix approach. An ethical matrix is the descriptive analysis of ethical stakes. It is a convenient way to systematically synthesize all the stakes associated to a specific problematic<SUP>1;2</SUP>. This is done through a two dimensional table combining all the actors concerned by the technology and three ethical principles:</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Well-being: </STRONG>the technology should contribute to the improving well-being</LI><LI><STRONG>Autonomy: </STRONG>the technology should respect people freedom</LI><LI><STRONG>Fairness: </STRONG>the technology should be accessible to all and evenly distributed.</LI></UL><P>The issued matrix is dynamic and change all along the project evolutions. We decided to develop a generic matrix, in opposition to a matrix dedicated to a single application. Here, you can find the lastest version we did before the end of the iGEM 2018 competition (Table 1). We used a color code to highlight the positive aspects (in green) and the points that require careful attention (in red). </P><I><OL style=" font-size:15px;"><LI> Mepham B., ‚ÄúA framework for the ethical analysis of novel foods: the ethical matrix‚Äù, Journal of agricultural and environmental ethics 12(2), 2000, p. 165-176.</LI><LI> Kermisch C., ¬´ L‚Äô√©valuation √©thique de technologies en pr√©sence de risques et d‚Äôincertitudes : une analyse critique des matrices √©thiques ¬ª, Proceedings du 19√®me Congr√®s de Ma√Ætrise des risques et de s√ªret√© de fonctionnement, 2014</LI></OL></I><H3 class="heavy">Ethical considerations about our Molecular Plateform </H3><TABLE class="table table-bordered"><THEAD><TR><TH scope="col" style="text-align:center;">Ethical principes/Actors</TH><TH scope="col" style="text-align:center;">Well Being</TH><TH scope="col" style="text-align:center;">Autonomy</TH><TH scope="col" style="text-align:center;">Fairness</TH></TR></THEAD><TBODY><TR><TH scope="row">End User</TH><TD><UL><LI style="color:red">Putative toxicity</LI><LI style="color:green">Improved or new product</LI></UL></TD><TD><UL><LI>Information about how to use the product</LI><LI style="color:red;">Acceptation of GMO products</LI><LI style="color:red;">Unnatural amino acid</LI></UL></TD><TD><UL><LI>Sustainability</LI></UL></TD></TR><TR><TH scope="row">Manufacturer</TH><TD><UL><LI style="color:red;">Putative toxicity</LI><LI style="color:green;">Alternative to other toxic processes</LI><LI style="color:green;">Economic well-being</LI></UL></TD><TD><UL><LI style="color:green;">Innovation</LI><LI style="color:green;">Competitiveness</LI><LI style="color:green;">State of the art approaches</LI><LI>Dependency on the clients</LI></UL></TD><TD><UL><LI>Fair exchanges with iGEM Toulouse</LI></UL></TD></TR><TR><TH scope="row">iGEM Toulouse</TH><TD><UL><LI style="color:green;">Economic well-being</LI><LI style="color:green;">Business development</LI></UL></TD><TD><UL><LI>Knowledge, innovation</LI><LI>Business management</LI><LI style="color:red;">Dependency on the manufacturers and the sub-contracters</LI></UL></TD><TD><UL><LI>Fair exchanges with the manufacturers and the sub-contracter</LI></UL></TD></TR><TR><TH scope="row">Sub-contracter</TH><TD><UL><LI>Economic well-being</LI></UL></TD><TD><UL><LI>Dependency on iGEM Toulouse</LI></UL></TD><TD><UL><LI>Fair exchanges with iGEM Toulouse</LI></UL></TD></TR><TR><TH scope="row">Environment</TH><TD><UL><LI style="color:red;">Degradability</LI><LI style="color:green;">Decrease of raw material needs</LI></UL></TD><TD><UL><LI style="color:red;">Impact of new product?</LI><LI style="color:red;">Consequences of high scale production?</LI></UL></TD><TD><UL><LI>Less pollutants?</LI></UL></TD></TR><TR><TH scope="row">Recycling</TH><TD><UL><LI style="color:green;">re-use of the product?</LI></UL></TD><TD><UL><LI>Information about how to handle  the products</LI><LI style="color:red;">Steps to recycle?</LI></UL></TD></TR><TR><TH scope="row">Experts</TH><TD><UL><LI style="color:green;">Better acceptation of biotechnologies</LI></UL></TD><TD><UL><LI style="color:green">Development of new applications</LI></UL></TD><TD><UL><LI style="color:red;">Accessibility to the technology ?</LI></UL></TD></TR><TR><TH scope="row">Politics</TH><TD><UL><LI>Help for development</LI><LI>Support (ecology/health)</LI></UL></TD><TD><UL><LI>Impartiality to validate or not the products</LI></UL></TD></TR><TR><TH scope="row">Media</TH><TD><UL><LI style="color:green;">Raising interest for sciences and new applications</LI></UL></TD><TD><UL><LI style="color:green;">Public education</LI><LI style="color: red">Polemics</LI></UL></TD><TD><UL><LI>Mediator role between public and scientific experts</LI></UL></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H3 class="heavy">Results</H3><P>We will only develop the analysis for the green and red points, as they are the most important ones.</P><UL style="font-size:16px;"><LI><B>End-users</B></LI><P>
										They are the final customers, the ones that will use our product. The absolute necessity is that Cerberus improve their well-being, either because it is an improvement of a technology they used before, either because it brings brand-new possibilities. On the downside, we have a lack of hindsight on putative toxicity of the product. This will have to be thoroughly tested before Cerberus and its associated functions reach the market. A less critical point is the fact that people could be afraid that our technology is issued from GMOs. However, they will not be in contact with GMOs but with a product issued from GMOs, which should make the acceptation easier. The use of unnatural amino acid in Cerberus could also raise suspicions in a public avid of natural compound. On the other hand, such perception is difficult to anticipate since it requires a good molecular biology knowledge to understand how something produced biologically could be unnatural...
									</P><LI><B>Manufacturer</B></LI><P>
										This is the producer of goods with the Cerberus technology. The same concern about toxicity than for the end-users could be addressed for the manufacturer. Beside the end-user benefits, manufacturer could find interest of their own in using Cerberus, for example, to replace dangerous chemicals in their processes. It will be important that Cerberus brought them some competitiveness regarding the price of their products which means that the cost of this new technology should be competitive regarding the one it replaces. Alternatively, the use of state-of-the-art approaches and/or innovation issued from Cerberus could be an asset for the manufacturer that could accept higher cost to label its products ‚Äúissued from biotechnology‚Äù.
									</P><LI><B>iGEM Toulouse</B></LI><P>
										This is us! For sure, developing our business will be a terrific opportunity with lot to learn in term of management and hopefully, with nice incomes. In term of autonomy, we will clearly be dependant on our clients (the manufacturers) and our sub-contracters (see the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS/Entrepreneurship">Entrepreneurship part</A>).
									</P><LI><B>Environment</B></LI><P>
										Ecological consequences are maybe the most difficult to predict. Our Cerberus platform is a protein , which should not be problematic, but for the unnatural amino acid AzF. Here, the molecule is of too recent a use to know what to expect. The same questioning occurs for the functions associated with Cerberus, especially the inorganic ones. We can suppose that if there should be a problem, they will be related to the scale of use/production of Cerberus. As a rupture technology, there could also be the impact of removing the previous technology. Less pollutant or less toxic approaches could be beneficial to the environment.
									</P><LI><B>Recycling</B></LI><P>
										Sustainability is a much though-for feature. Ideally, Cerberus should be recollected from used goods to be reincorporated in new one. This could prove to be complex (or easy), depending on the strength of association and accessibility in the fabrics. Besides, this could require complex steps incompatible with the recycling interest.
									</P><LI><B>Experts</B></LI><P>
										If we think of Cerberus as a technology to create new materials, its usefulness goes beyond functionalised cellulose. Therefore, Cerberus can also be of interest in the scientific field to develop new applications. This incidentally raises the question of accessibility. If Cerberus is accessible to all (as any biobrick from the iGEM registry), some of its application could be protected by patents, especially if this is the heart of our business. This could create conflicts and will require professional lawyer to define the boundaries of what is public or not. Another aspect is that such effort as Cerberus could democratize the use of biotechnology-sourced products with the general public and facilitate the acceptation of other products.
									</P><LI><B>Media</B></LI><P>
										Cerberus could be of interest for the media and so participate to biotechnology acceptation. This could make people curious or eager about what future biotechnology could bring them. In the downside, sterile polemics could be issued from such display.
									</P></UL><H3 class="heavy">Conclusion</H3><P>We found the ethical matrix very useful to highlight the pros and cons of our project. It clearly showed that using the Cerberus technology have to be a progress for both the end-users, the manufacturer and the environment. Safety will be a definitive go/no go. Assessment of non-toxicity and environmental friendliness will be top priorities before Cerberus hit the market.</P></DIV><DIV class="tab-pane fade" id="HP_Part3" role="tabpanel"><H2 class="heavy">INDIVIDUAL THOUGHTS</H2><P>In the scope of the Cerberus Project, we created surveys and interviews to know what people think about biotechnologies and synthetic biology, and their perception about using products issued from such fields. However, we very soon found out that each iGEMer from our team had a different perception of biotechnologies and beyond of iGEM and their expectations from the competition after these months of working on the project. </P><P>Here you can find these individual thoughts and their synthesis.</P><H3 class="heavy">SYNTHESIS</H3><H4 class="heavy">Why did you take part to iGEM?</H4><P>Many reasons led us to the extraordinary adventure that is iGEM. Firstly, we were all interested in biology and more precisely in synthetic biologies that we chose to study at the University or the INSA school. iGEM was for us an opportunity to make a step in our future and develop our first team project as we hope to do later as researchers. What an adventure to make! Some of us were also implicated because of the extreme diversity of the project and its openness on the world.

Each member of our team was accountable for one aspect of Cerberus. You can find in the individual files what each of us have done and what we prefer in our ‚Äútask‚Äù.</P><H4 class="heavy">What did you learn from this experience?</H4><P>We all learned a lot about building a scientific project from scratch to its valorization. We started this project as student, some of us had never even done an internship. It allowed us to encompass the full aspects of how to create a little business. Moreover, being a part of a team during nearly one year was not easy everyday, so we had to learn how to work together, how to support each other when stuff gets hectic. With iGEM, we also discovered domains that we never thought about like finances, collaborations with teams from all over the world, communication with the public or even teaching in schools. </P><H4 class="heavy">To what extends have this experience changed the way you conceive your future job?</H4><P>The answers here are very different between us. Some confirmed their initial goal but for some other new careers have been considered, even if always in relation with biology. So this project truly helped us to define our career.</P><H4 class="heavy">What comes to your mind when you are told about biotechnologies?</H4><P>We are not actually neutral for this question since we all want to work in the biotechnological field in the future. We are all amazed with the possibilities that synthetic biology opens to our world. From within the iGEM project, we realized that a fence exists between the lab and society. In France, there is a paradoxical mix between excitation and fear when it comes to sciences, mainly due to the fact that people do not know enough, especially about synthetic biology. During this year, we have done our best to change this by participating to events and school interventions (and many other activities as described in this human practices section). We all hope that it contributed to change the point of view of people about biotechnologies.</P><H3 class="heavy">EXTENDED THOUGHT</H3><P>We hope that our individual thoughts helped you to know a little more about our team and how we perceive biotechnologies. iGEM has actually impacted our life, and the way we feel our position in the society.

It has already revolutionized health by increasing our understanding of diseases and decreasing the cost of drugs, a huge step toward personalized medicine and therefore a better life.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><H3 class="heavy">OUR COLLABORATORS' DETAILLED ANSWERS (just click!)</H3><H4 class="heavy">Team NUS_Singapore</H4><DIV id="HP_IS_Tab_Group_NUS"><DIV class="accordion-group m-1"><DIV class="card collapse" id="HP_ISNUS1" data-parent="#HP_IS_Tab_Group_NUS"><DIV class="card-body"><H4 class="heavy">Liyana</H4><B>Why did you take part in iGEM?</B><P>I like that it‚Äôs beyond just doing research.

After that, I studied in microbiology to know more about those organisms we can use in biotechnology. To me, it represents a way to change the world as we know it. Of course, biotechnologies could be used to harm people, but it is not how I see it. There are so many things we can do with biotechnologies, it is like all the tools in the world are contained in DNA and now the only limit is our imagination.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="tab-pane fade" id="entrep" role="tabpanel"><P> We truly believe that our project could pave the way to the development of a successful start-up. We therefore launched an entrepreneurship approach to design the business model of such a company. We first met biotech startups and technology transfer centers to confront our project to real businesses. Then, in collaboration with a startup incubator, we deepened several aspects of the business. We identified the most critical points of the project and developed a business plan to assess its value, feasibility and durability in terms of marketing, finance and law. These led us to define our future company as centered on advice, conception and innovation to provide manufacturers with functionalised molecules produced by our sub-contractors. It‚Äôs time to knock on bank doors!</P><P>For more details, visit our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS/Entrepreneurship">Entrepreneurship page</A></P></DIV><DIV class="tab-pane fade" id="EPE" role="tabpanel"><P> During the Cerberus project, we meet the public on several occasions and we have soon understood the crucial importance of communicating and educating. We therefore participated to scientific and non-scientific events, explained our project in the media and committed ourselves in making children aware of biotechnology possibilities. We also carried on the development of a card game, MicrobioWorld, explaining molecular microbiology in a fun way. However important were these actions at a local scale, it was frustrating to not reach more people. We therefore initiated contacts with the French Department of Education and we helped them to develop a pedagogic wallet distributed to all the ‚ÄúSciences and Techniques of Laboratory‚Äù high schools, at the national-scale. They loved Microbioworld which will be part of the wallet. So, our Education &amp; Public Engagement is not done with iGEM but will be pursued for the year to come or more.</P><P>For more details, visit our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS/Public_Engagement">Education and Public Engagement page</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN><DIV class="container-fluid bg-secondary shadow-lg text-light" id="FOOTER"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-10 text-justify" id="FOOTER_CONTENT"><DIV id="DISCLAIMER"><I><P><I>No dogs were harmed over the course of this iGEM project.</I></P><P class="sponsor">The whole <B>Toulouse INSA-UPS team</B> wants to thank our sponsors, especially:</P><P class="sponsor">And many more.
