It also includes human endoparasites which may cause infections, allergies or toxicity. This Decree is the French transposition of  Directive 90/679 / EEC and is also transcribed in the Labour Code (Articles L4421-1 R4421-1 to R4427-5). This Decree of 16th July 2007 describes the technical preventive measures that must be followed in research laboratories, where workers are likely to be exposed to biological pathogens. We must obey the rules of health, safety, and preventive medicine applied in public services in France (Decree No. 82-453). This decree refers to the Labour Code, Public Health Code and Environmental Code.</P><H3 id="SD-form" class="heavy">Training received</H3><P>To follow the legislation, we have been trained by Nathalie Doubrovine, safety department supervisor of the LISBP. Her goal is to ensure both employee well-being and the observation of safety rules and risk prevention. During the summer, we received different training modules:
                              </P><P>General information: two modules were completed, one during a meeting with Nathalie Doubrovine and the other with NEO  software. General information was presented about the chemical, biological and fire risks. We also learned about the prevention of those risks and the reaction to those risks if they occur. At the end of the training, a little test was completed to see if everyone understood everything. Also, before using any new device, an initial training must be completed.</P><LI><P>Autoclave training: our team attended autoclave training, which showed us the explosive and implosive dangers of the equipment and the security measures to take to protect ourselves. A lab coat, heat resistant gloves and glasses were required for the manipulation of the autoclave. The standard protocols of loading and unloading were also demonstrated.</P></LI><LI><P>Ethidium bromide room (Figure 2): because of the oncogenic risk of ethidium bromide, we have a specific room where we must work with this solution. Nothing can exit the room when once it enters it and everyone in the room must wear protective gloves, a lab coat and protection goggles. UV is also used in this room and a protective mask must be wore during its use.</P></LI><DIV style="text-align:center"><FIGURE class="figure" style="text-align:center;"><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption"><STRONG>Figure 2:</STRONG><I>Ethidium Bromide Handling Room.</I></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="tab-pane fade" id="Safe_Part2" role="tabpanel"><H2 id="KR" class="heavy">Knowing the risks and minimizing them</H2><H3 id="KR-haz" class="heavy">Potential Hazards</H3><P>In the laboratory, there are a large variety of potential risks.

One hazard category includes risks that are not directly linked to the LISBP research activity such as those due to working conditions (noise, thermal atmosphere, etc.), electrical hazards, work on computer screens, falls, and so on. The main hazard categories concern the substances handled for research purposes such as class 1 microorganisms (GMO or not), urban wastewaters, chemical products among including CMRs, cryogenic fluids, to name a few. A second main hazard category relates to equipment and pilot plants with specific risks such as equipment using pressurized liquids, gases or steam (autoclaves), instruments generating non-ionizing radiations (Laser, UV lights) and electromagnetic radiation (RMN).</P><H4>Hazardous chemicals:</H4><P><U>List of hazardous, chemicals &amp; inventory:</U></P><P>The list of hazardous, chemicals and inventory is managed independently by each LISBP sub group. A common LISBP list of CMR substances is monitored and updated.</P><P><U>Waste management plan:</U></P><P>The chemical waste is managed in accordance with the environmental code. First, the waste is stored on a specially adapted LISBP/INSA site, before being disposed of by a subcontracted service provider in accordance with the ADR rules concerning the waste treatment, valorization or destruction. Each waste removal is accompanied by tracking forms for monitoring of hazardous waste.</P><P><U>Vacuum/pressurized equipment:</U></P><P>Pressurized equipment is monitored according to  from 15 March 2000 Decree concerning work with vacuum and high-pressure equipment.</P><P><U>Cryogenic/high temperature equipment:</U></P><P>Implementation of adequate means of prevention.</P><H4>Biological safety:</H4><P><U>Biological safety plan:</U></P><P>The laboratory applies the measures stated in the articles of French Labour Code: L.4421-1 and R. 4421-1 a R. 4427-5 (Directive 90/619 on life insurance from 26 November 1990).</P><P><U>Biological material Type of organism used:</U></P><P>The <I>E. coli</I> and <I>P. pastoris</I> strains that we use are non-pathogenic and their genomes are very well characterized. These organisms are classified in the Risk group 1, which is the lowest level. These organisms do not cause diseases in healthy adult humans. (However, they might cause diseases in young children, elderly people, or people with immune system deficiencies.). All media and materials were autoclaved to ensure we will not disseminate GMOs outside the lab.</P><P><U>Biosafety cabinets:</U></P><FIGURE class="figure" style="text-align:center;"><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption"><STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG><I>Microbiology Safety Hood at our lab</I></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>The use of PSM type II guarantee the sterility of manipulations and protection of the environment and of the manipulator.</P><P><U>Decontamination plan:</U></P><P>Certain laboratory rooms are subjected to gaseous decontamination once per year or upon request.</P><P><U>Biological waste management plan:</U></P><P>Biological waste (liquid or solid) is pretreated chemically (bleach) or by autoclaving.

The brainstorming process was particularly affected by these points. We wanted to work on a project that could live outside the iGEM competition and outside the lab. So, quite early on, we selected our ideas depending on ‚Äúwill the use of GMOs become an issue for customer safety and also that of the environment‚Äù. Our Cerberus project needs GMOs but we have developed it to avoid any contact for the product user but also with the environment. The final goal of the project is to produce a protein in the laboratory through GMOs but only the protein, and not the organism that produced it, is used.</P><P>If this part of our project construction interests you, we invite you to read the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS/Human_Practices">Human Practices section</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN><DIV class="container-fluid bg-secondary shadow-lg text-light" id="FOOTER"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-10 text-justify" id="FOOTER_CONTENT"><DIV id="DISCLAIMER"><I><P><I>No dogs were harmed over the course of this iGEM project.</I></P><P class="sponsor">The whole <B>Toulouse INSA-UPS team</B> wants to thank our sponsors, especially:</P><P class="sponsor">And many more.
