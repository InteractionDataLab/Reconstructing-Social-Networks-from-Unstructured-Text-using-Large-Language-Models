Collaboration
We collaborated with several teams from around the world, including University of Minnesota and University of Montpellier, France. Check out our Collaborations page to learn more! We also collaborated with a team outside of iGEM called ITESG. Check out our work with them on the Partnership page.
Human Practices (Silver)
We contacted family members, friends, and representatives of the World Health Organization to discuss current issues with birth control. We sent out questionnaires to several grassroot organizations and advocacy groups around the world to gauge their interest in our product and learn about stigma, cost, and access issues. We also presented to local classes to teach them about iGEM and discuss potential ethical issues with our project. For more information, check out our Human Practices page !
