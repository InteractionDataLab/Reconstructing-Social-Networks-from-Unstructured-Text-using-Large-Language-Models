Project Description
PoPPY There is a lack of access to family planning services for women across the globe. The ability to pursue an education, sports, a career, all start with the luxury to choose when, and if, to begin a family. Progesterone is a hormone naturally produced by women, and can be used to suppress ovulation and act as a form of contraception. Yarrowia lipolytica is a GRAS organism that has an advanced genetic toolbox and can be easily grown in most environments. We will engineer Yarrowia lipolytica to produce progesterone; our hope is to localize contraception production and increase availability in developing nations.
