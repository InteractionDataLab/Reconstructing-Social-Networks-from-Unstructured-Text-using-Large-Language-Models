We will construct our gene cassettes and insert them into the <I>Yarrowia lipolytica</I> genome in three parallel experiments. In the preliminary experiment, we will use the strain <I>Y. lipolytica str. FKP393</I> which has the auxotrophic markers <I>leu2</I> and <I>ura3</I> for selection. We will engineer a second strain named Lip<I>Lox</I>, that will contain the gene for uracil flanked by lox sites <I>loxP</I> and <I>lox71</I> for use in experiments 1, 2, and 3 below. This will allow us to have a yeast strain that contains lox sites, as well as a strain that now has uracil in a designed location that we can swap in or out as a selectable marker.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="flex-row"><DIV class="flex-col hex-header hex0"><H2 class="center" id="Expe_lip"> CREATE LIPLOX </H2><P>The first step in our project was to engineer a strain of yeast with an genetic marker in the location we plan on inserting the genes for the progesterone biosynthesis pathway. We also use Cre-<I>lox</I> integration in later experiments, so we needed to enter <I>lox</I> sites into our strain as well. Because <I>Y. lipolytica str. FKP393</I>  is auxotrophic for uracil, we can replace this gene in a specific location as a marker for a second homologous recombination (HR) experiment. When we perform the other HR experiment, the uracil gene will be swapped out, and we can use 5-FOA media as our selection tool. </P><H3>Homology Arms</H3><P>We designed homology arms (HA) for homologous recombination that span 1 kb upstream and downstream of the ade2 gene in <I>Y. lipolytica str. FKP393</I>. To prepare HAs for this experiment, and Experiment 1, we amplified the HAs out of the <I>Y. lipolytica str. FKP393</I>  genome using primers flagged with Gibson overhangs (GOs) homologous with the gene cassette ends and the linearized pUC19 backbone as seen in Figure 1. This ensured that the HAs were ready for GA after being amplified out.</P><DIV class="imageCont"><P><B>Figure 1</B>: Isolation of DNA from yeast, and PCR amplification of upstream and downstream homology arms that surround <I>ade2</I> out of <I>Y. lipolytica str.

After several failed attempts, we found that we needed to extract the genomic DNA (gDNA) from <I>Y. lipolytica str. FKP393</I> and then PCR-amplify the HAs out of it. To extract the gDNA from <I>Y. lipolytica str. FKP393</I>, we used lithium acetate and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to lyse the cells, then precipitated the gDNA with ethanol. See our <A href="">Protocols section</A> below for Yeast DNA Extraction protocol. We used touchdown PCR with the gDNA and flagged primers to amplify the arms out. We checked the success of PCR amplification using gel electrophoresis.</P><H3>Enter <I>lox</I> sites and <I>ura3</I> into <I>Y. lipolytica str.

The HAs were designed with ends homologous with <I>loxP-ura3-lox71</I> gene block and pUC19. This design enables GA to seamlessly stitch together all four fragments resulting in pOPPY-UC19-yXXU seen in Figure 2. Because HR requires a linear construct, we will amplify out the product from UHA to DHA. We will perform HR and the <I>loxP-ura3-lox71</I> fragment will be exchanged for the <I>ade2</I> gene region between the HAs in the <I>Y. lipolytica str.

We wanted to collect this characterization data to help us better familiarize ourselves with how riboswitches work. We measured the fluorescence and OD600 of samples of E. coli in M9 minimal media and LB with various concentrations of vitamin b12 over a period of time to learn about the behavior of the promoter and the riboswitch itself.</P><P>We will amplify our pHR-D17-hrGFP plasmid by transforming it into <I>E. coli</I> using the NEB High Efficiency Transformation protocol for DH5-α competent <I>E. coli</I> cells. After we select for our successfully transformed colonies by plating them on luria broth / ampicillin (LB/ampicillin) media, we will perform a plasmid DNA isolation using the ZyppyTM Plasmid Miniprep Kit. We will measure the concentration of our plasmid isolations using NanoDropTM analysis, examine the identity using restriction digest, and will confirm them with Sanger sequencing. We will use PCR with primers RiLin(r)1 and RiLin(f)1 to linearize pHR-D17-hrGFP and simulate a blunt-end double strand break in the 3’ UTR of the hrGFP gene.</P><P>We will order five different DNA gene blocks from IDT, each containing our riboswitch expression platform, one of the five progesterone-specific aptamers describe in Contreras Jim ́enez et al. (2015), and two end sequences that will form overhangs homologous to the blunt-end sequences of the linearized plasmid (Win and Smolke, 2007; Contreras Jim ́enez et al., 2015). We will amplify these inserts using the Apt(f) and Apt(r) primers, which are specific to the HAs held in common by each of them. We will then Gibson-Assemble our riboswitch inserts into linearized pHR-D17-hrGFP.</P><P>Next, we will transform these experimental plasmids into DH5-α competent <I>E. coli</I> cells for amplification. After isolating these plasmids from <I>E. coli</I>, we will linearize the plasmids again using RiHA1(f) and RiHA(r) to create a linear portion of DNA consisting of the TEF(136) promoter, cyc1 terminator, hrGFP gene, riboswitch structure, and HAs suitable for integration into the Yali genome.</P><P>Following transformation into Yali, we will use replica plating to compare identical colonies in the absence and presence of progesterone. If any colonies show working riboswitch constructs, we will isolate and linearize plasmid DNA from these previous cultures using our yeast miniprep protocol, provided in appendix A.4, and PCR. We will then transform these linearized plasmids into Y. lipolytica str. PoPPY cells. Because of our aptamers high binding affinity, they are not suitable for measuring a relatively large dose of progesterone in a consumer’s culture. If one of our five aptamers shows functionality within our riboswitch structure, we will run trials using the column electrophoresis SELEX method described by Mosing and Bowser (2009) and random mutagenesis via error-prone PCR, which is described in a paper by McCullum et al. (2010), to identify variants that show a decreased sensitivity for progesterone which will trigger fluorescence at higher concentrations (Mosing and Bowser, 2009; McCullum et al., 2010).</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="flex-row"><DIV class="flex-col center"><H2 style="margin-bottom: 0 !important;"> Detection of Progesterone</H2></DIV></DIV><DIV class="flex-row"><DIV class="flex-col center"><P>We picked colonies from Yeast Mediated Cloning transformations of <I>Y. lipolytica</I> and <I>S. cerevisiae</I> that grew on our leucine-deficient plates.

During PCR, primers anneal to their complementary sequence and recruit DNA polymerase to extend the sequence in the 5' to 3' Direction.</LI><LI>Design a forward (5'- 3') and a reverse primer (3'- 5') to amplify both the top and bottom DNA strands. The ideal primer length is between 18 and 23 bp, but this can be changed to accommodate other constraints.</LI><LI>For the forward primer, select a sequence of base pairs (bp) of optimal length.</LI><LI>Repeat Step 3 for the reverse primer and generate the reverse complement of the reverse primer sequence.</LI><LI>Analyze each sequence using a computational primer tool (such as IDT's Oligo Analyzer) and record the GC content and the melting temperature (Tm) for each primer.</LI><LI>The optimal GC content is between 40-60%, and the optimal Tm range is between 52-62℃. Ideally, the difference in Tm for the forward and reverse primer pair should not exceed 5℃.</LI><LI>If the GC content exceeds 60% for either primer, add High GC Enhancer to the PCR reaction mix.</LI><LI>Check that the free energy (ΔG) value for self-dimers and hetero-dimers on each primer is above -10 kcal/mol to avoid primers spontaneously self-annealing or annealing to each other.</LI><LI>Check that hairpin formations do not exceed 30℃ in each primer. PCR uses different temperatures for each thermocycler step; the lowest temperature used during the replication step for primer annealing is 58-60℃. If hairpins form around this temperature, the primer binding efficiency may be reduced and yield less product. However, if the primer Tm is above the hairpin formation temperature, and if the potential hairpin leaves the 3' end of the primer free for annealing, the primer should still anneal properly without reducing PCR Efficiency.</LI></OL></DIV><DIV id="ECM" class="buttoncontent"><H3><I>E.
