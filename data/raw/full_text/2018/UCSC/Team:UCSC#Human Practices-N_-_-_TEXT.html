Worldwide connections - a UCSC tradition:
The iGEM Competition pushes teams to work to improve quality of life. To help the world requires an understanding of what the world is asking for; as the 6th UCSC iGEM team, we uphold the reputation of UCSC investing heavily in worldwide outreach to not only spread the word about our project, but to understand the impact of our project on a personal level. Through these personal connections, we evaluated potential issues related to our project including stigma, price, ethics, safety, security, and sustainability.
Women are interested in birth control methods to assist them plan for their few children produced instead of producing many children which cannot be cared for.
— Evelyn Lewsley
Inspiration:
Before choosing a project topic, our team emailed over 50 WHO representatives around the globe to determine the most pressing issues. With the women’s rights movement on the rise, the UCSC 2018 iGEM team wanted to prompt the discussion of women’s health at this year’s competition. We determined that many less-developed countries struggle to access contraception because of stigma, location, and cost. Our goal was to target those countries to test if they’d be interested in our new contraception method, and willing to speak with us regarding their personal experiences.
Execution:
Our outreach team contacted several big organizations, associations, and foundations for help on finding locals willing to speak to us. Not many of them got back to us, so we instead went an alternative route. We searched GoFundMe and found a group of women in Uganda known as the Joy Women’s Group asking for money to help buy condoms for their community. They were funded through the Brighter Brains Institute (BBI) and we quickly contacted the BBI who put us into contact with three local women’s groups in Uganda. Through word of mouth, we reached 7 additional women’s groups. We created a questionnaire for locals to fill out to have more uniform responses. Their response to our efforts prompted us to reach out to other groups in 15 more countries to further spread our word and evaluate the need for cheaper, more accessible birth control.
Execution:
We received input from over ___ countries as well as ____ responses to our questionnaire. Thien tiekd of fof wno sonl; sldi  idj  fidn rio dn oi oi . IBf o df  dio  fid yuio bnm, tyuios dhjk.

Joy Women's Group:
We are currently working on updating information. We will update as it becomes avaliable.
Kinywankoko United Women Association (KUWA):
KUWA is a women’s group based in the Kasese Municipality of Uganda. They assist marginalized women in the surrounding villages by providing them condoms, sanitary products, feminine hygiene education, and economic empowerment. They reside in the Bukonzo county which is “rated among the poorest counties where women live below poverty line and one survives on less than one US dollar a day” (Kabugho Beatrace, chairperson of KUWA). Our iGEM team made contact with Kabugho Beatrace through Hank Pellissier of the Brighter Brains Institute (BBI). The Brighter Brains Institute offered to partner with us, as they’ve supplied condoms to Ugandan women in the past and were interested in our new method. According to Kabugho Beatrace, the population of Kasese increases every day due to high birth rates. At the same time, there is also a high infant mortality rate, as mothers are in too poor of health to carry a child. The only contraception available in Bukonzo county are condoms sold in remote pharmacies. According to Kabugho Beatrace, the condoms are placed near registers and customers are often too afraid to be seen purchasing condoms due to the overwhelming stigma on birth control in Uganda. When we spoke with Beatrace, she was very supportive of our new method of contraception. She works closely with other women’s groups in Uganda and contacted them excitedly to discuss our new method and provide us their input on our project’s safety, maintainability, and cost. Our team is extremely grateful for Kabugho Beatrace and the connections she provided us.

Buhanga Thuligahuma Women's Group:
Through the recommendation of Hank Pellissier of BBI, our team contacted a Buhangan villager named Masereka Sebastian. Buhanga is a rural village of 2,000 people, and all are members of the BaKonzo tribe. The village is extremely isolated. According to Masereka Sebastian, you can't drive a car there--you have to walk 3 kilometers or take a dirt bike there. Being that Masereka Sebastian owns a dirt bike and can access printing shops outside of the village, our iGEM team contacted him to print our questionnaires for distribution to the local Buhanga Women. We had over 42 women interested in taking our survey, but we limited the number to ten. The women chosen to participate in our research were left to the discretion of Sebastian. Some women chose not to have their answers published as well. From their questionnaire responses, we learned how expensive contraception methods are, and how many women’s husbands don’t respond positively to them using birth control. As with the other questionnaire responses, more of the same rumors were brought up; specifically, that birth control can cause cancer or infertility. We also learned that Uganda is a heavily Catholic country. According to one of the Buhangan women participants, many Catholic churches discourage women from using birth control and compare it to killing (similar to opinions on abortion). No other groups have mentioned religion in their responses, so we were very grateful that the Buhanga Women informed us of this discouragement. We hope the brochure our team is working on will address many of these rumors.
Promote Africa Foundation:
We discovered the Promote Africa Foundation through the Joy Women’s Group. The Promote Africa Foundation is a united women’s group that runs programs related to female reproductive health and women’s rights. According to Evelyn Lewsley, the leader of the PAF, they “encourage women to space their children because most children are abandoned by families who fail to provide for their children”. The Promote Africa Foundation encourages birth control methods throughout the Kasese District, and they’re currently encouraging birth control injections, but struggle to get women to participate since injections may cause bleeding. The Promote Africa Foundation is excited to work with us as they hope our birth control method will be safer for the women in Uganda.
Basaliza Women Development Association (BAWODA)
We are currently working on updating information. We will update as it becomes avaliable.
Rita Women Development Association:
The Rita Women Development Association resides in the Rwenzori region of Western Uganda. This group empowers women in their community and prevent the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases. Through the recommendation of Kabugho Beatrace of KUWA, we made contact with the Rita women. Masika Vicky, the chairperson of Rita, informed us that there is a lot of stigma on contraception use (primarily condoms because they are the only contraception available). Currently, their group is working on an anti-HIV/AIDS campaign because there is a high rate of people affected by the virus in the Rwenzori region. The spread of HIV/AIDS stems from the stigma on contraception use; according to Masika Vicky, 98% of people fear to buy condoms in public and therefore have unprotected sex despite the outbreak of HIV/AIDS. This stigma also correlates with the high birth rates, similar to those seen in the Kasese Municipality where KUWA resides. Masika Vicky relayed that “Uganda is now highly populated, so we are encouraging family planning.” We spoke to five Rita women about their opinions on our progesterone-producing yeast and they all were excited for a contraception method containing natural progesterone (as opposed to progestin, the synthetic form of progesterone). One Rita member informed us that they’ve initiated “related programmes to teach women about reproductive health and child spacing”. We are grateful to work with a group with similar goals to ours, and we appreciate the insight their questionnaire responses provided us.

The PoPPY team would like to thank everyone who has helped make this project possible. For the past five years, undergraduates at UCSC have participated in iGEM. This year, the team is composed of students studying Bioengineering, Bioinformatics, Bioengineering (Assistive Technology: Motor), Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Marine Biology, and Cognitive Science: Artificial Intelligence and Human Computer Interaction. Our diverse group of individuals is crucial for the creative process behind using synthetic biology to help others. Modern engineering demands collaboration between individuals and pushes them to think critically and work efficiently. Through synthetic biology, the 2018 UCSC iGEM team is creating effective solutions and developing models for future success.
