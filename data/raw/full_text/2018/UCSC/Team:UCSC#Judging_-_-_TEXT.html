Presentation
Our presentation is locked in at 9am on Thursday morning. Come check us out.
Judging Form
We submitted our form to the iGEM site. Check out this page for a more in depth overview of what we have accomplished.
Attributions
This project would not have been possible without the support of friends, staff, sponsors, and more. You can find a list of all the individuals who supported us on our Attributions Page.
Characterizing a Biobrick
We decided to characterize UCSC 2017 iGEM's BBa_k2223004: riboswitch this year. Find out more information on our Parts Page .
New Biobrick
Learn more about our biobrick on our Parts page.
Collaboration
We collaborated with several teams from around the world, including University of Minnesota and University of Montpellier, France. Check out our Collaborations page to learn more! We also collaborated with a team outside of iGEM called ITESG. Check out our work with them on our Partnership page.
Human Practices (Silver)
We contacted family members, friends, and representatives of the World Health Organization to discuss current issues with birth control. We sent out questionnaires to several grassroot organizations and advocacy groups around the world to gauge their interest in our product and learn about stigma, cost, and access issues. We also presented to local classes and partook in a TEDx talk to teach people about iGEM and discuss potential ethical issues with our project. For more information, check out our Human Practices page !
Integrated Human Practices
We took what we learned from our questionnaire and other outreach efforts to create a product tailored to our potential users. The women who returned questionnaires encouraged us to consider cost, location, and accessibility. We localized contraceptive production because we were informed that drugstores and hospitals are far away for women in rural areas. We will use discreet packaging for our product because several women are worried about being seen using birth control in stigmatized areas. We are also researching ways to get our product to market in several countries by collaborating with Family Planning 2020 and Population Council. Given that our yeast needs a food source, we collaborated with the ITESG research team and engineered our yeast to survive off upcycled dairy waste. Through our conversations, we determined that women even in rural areas have high accessibility to milk-producing animals, which makes our milk-surviving yeast plausible for most areas worldwide.
Demonstration of our work
We accomplished a lot throughout the summer. Just recently, we successfully inserted our genes and successfully produced progesterone. Click on our Results Page here to see more.
