Thank You
The PoPPY team would like to thank everyone who has helped make this project possible. For the past five years, undergraduates at UCSC have participated in iGEM. This year, the team is composed of students studying Bioengineering, Bioinformatics, Bioengineering (Assistive Technology: Motor), Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Marine Biology, and Cognitive Science: Artificial Intelligence and Human Computer Interaction. Our diverse group of individuals is crucial for the creative process behind using synthetic biology to help others. Modern engineering demands collaboration between individuals and pushes them to think critically and work efficiently. Through synthetic biology, the 2018 UCSC iGEM team is creating effective solutions and developing models for future success.

The Project Idea
We came to the idea of PoPPY after many journal club meetings including all team members. The initial idea was proposed by captain Morgan Tardy and was eventually agreed upon by the entire team.
Official Team
Advisors
Dr. David Bernick, Assistant Adjunct Professor, University of California Santa Cruz, Department of Biomolecular Engineering
Guided our team and offered valuable insight and advice through each stage of the project. He also helped the team manage    funding, finances and logistical tasks.
Mckenna Hicks, Master's Student, University of California Santa Cruz, Department of Biomolecular Engineering
Guided us and provided advice on gene design and wet lab experiments
Research Support
Tony Carr, Professor of Molecular Genetics, University of Sussex, Genome Damage and Stability, Genome Damage and Stability Centre
Answered questions regarding size of genomic insert, directionality of lox sites, and cre-lox.
Stefan Tippmann, Visiting Researcher, Chalmers University, Life Science Engineering
Clarified Questions on yeast in general and provided us with additional readings to look through.
Oliver Konzock, PhD Student, Chalmers University, Life Science Engineering
Answered questions general questions on how to grow yeast and yarrowia lipolytica. Answered questions on how to do yeast mediated cloning.
Jean-Marc Nicaud, Directeur de Recherche INRA
Introduced us to Golden Gate Assembly method. Answered questions building plasmids. Showed us M1G1 wouldn't be an issue.
Adam Watson, Research Fellow, University of Sussex, Genome Damage and Stability
Answered questions regarding size of genomic insert, directionality of lox sites, and cre-lox in general.
Erin Bredeweg, Biosystms Dynamics & Simula Scientist, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
Assisted in location and finding sequence information of Yarrowia strain.
Catherine Duport, University of Avignon, Microbiotechnology, Ecotoxicology, and Bioremediation
Helped clarify pieces of experiment such as why she used certain promoters. Attempted to find yarrowia strain.
Saumya Ramarao, Senior Associate, Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition
Provided information regarding birth control production and needs.
Hal Alper, Professor, The University of Texas at Austin, Department of Chemical Engineering
