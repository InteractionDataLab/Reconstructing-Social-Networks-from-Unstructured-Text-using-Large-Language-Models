Five students had met with a sponsor in the morning and when the two captains returned to the room, the students were milling around, whispering under their breath, and fidgeting. The problem was with motivation towards the project, as some students felt that it wasn’t novel enough. We had found a 1998 paper by Duport et al. that explained how their team developed yeast to produce pregnenolone and progesterone - the things we wanted to make. It turns out though that the paper didn’t lead to anything, the strain has been lost, and it was a good proof of concept for our idea.

We figured out after much deliberation how we could have our friends in developing nations get the accurate dose of progesterone. We learned from our mentor that we could use a technique to measure the weight of an object using a coat hanger, and depending on weight, calculate the amount of lactose inside that container. This would be the dairy that the people have on hand. Depending on weight, we will have a chart that says how much lactose is in that container. The people will be guided to portion a certain amount of the lactose into an ice-cube-like container and grow the yeast in there. Because there will be a specific amount of lactose in each section, and our promoters are sensitive to galactose, our yeast will stop producing progesterone after it consumes all of the lactose. We have found multiple ways to insert our genes into Y.lipolytica and we made pros and cons lists for each method to decide which one would be the most effective and time-efficient. The methods are regular homologous recombination using homologous arms on our plasmid, EasyCloneYALI: CRISPR/Cas9‐based technique for engineering Y.lipolytica specifically, and Drag and Drop cloning. </P></DIV><P class="section-title week" id="Jul9"><SPAN style="font-size: 150%">Week of July 9th</SPAN></P><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook6" onclick="openInfoBlock6('Jul9Ove', this, '#e91b63')" id="defaultOpen6">Overview</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook6" onclick="openInfoBlock6('Jul9Gib', this, '#e91b63')">Gibson Assembly</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook6" onclick="openInfoBlock6('Jul9Mod', this, '#e91b63')">Modeling</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook6" onclick="openInfoBlock6('Jul9Oep', this, '#e91b63')">Gene Amplification</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook6" onclick="openInfoBlock6('Jul9Yea', this, '#e91b63')">YMC</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook6" onclick="openInfoBlock6('Jul9Bio', this, '#e91b63')">Biobrick &amp; Terminator</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook6" onclick="openInfoBlock6('Jul9Rib', this, '#e91b63')">Riboswitch</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook6" onclick="openInfoBlock6('Jul9Oth', this, '#e91b63')">Other</BUTTON><DIV id="Jul9Ove" class="buttoncontent6"><P>We confirmed that using a constitutive promoter would be better than an inducible one, at least initially, because it will use up energy to keep producing progesterone after the growth media has been consumed. Our website has gone through several prototype designs, but it seems like we may be getting close to a final design we would like to use to represent our work. One fun feature that is a work in progress is an interactive map that will, when moused over, provide information about different countries and our outreach there. We have also been working on finalizing our logo, which will include the name of our project: PoPPY. PoPPY stands for Portable Progesterone Production in Yeast, an accurate description of the goal of our project. A low this week for the team was realizing that most of the survey responses received from one of the groups we reached out to about contraceptive accessibility were unreliable, since many answers between supposedly different women were the exact same, word for word. However, we hope that this was a problem specific to the group, and not the norm. We have some more legitimate groups who are willing to send us photos of the women filling out the surveys, and we hope to see good results. A high for the team this week was finally understanding how Cre-Lox recombination, a method that we will use in one of our experiments to integrate our gene cassette into the yeast genome, works. We now expect to run three parallel experiments to get to our end goal: a control using Gibson and homologous arms to create our gene cassette and integrate it into our <I>Y. lipolytica genome</I>; assembly of the plasmid inside <I>S. cerevisiae</I> using yeast-mediated cloning,  isolation and insertion of the plasmid into <I>E. coli</I> for amplification, and insertion of the gene cassette into <I>Y. lipolytica</I> using lox sites; and assembly of gene cassette/plasmid inside <I>Y. lipolytica</I> and integration into genome using lox sites. For each of the three experiments, we will begin by inserting lox sites into the <I>Y. lipolytica</I> genome using homologous recombination. </P></DIV><P class="section-title week" id="Jul16"><SPAN style="font-size: 150%">Week of July 16th</SPAN></P><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook7" onclick="openInfoBlock7('Jul16Ove', this, '#e91b63')" id="defaultOpen7">Overview</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook7" onclick="openInfoBlock7('Jul16Gib', this, '#e91b63')">Gibson Assembly</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook7" onclick="openInfoBlock7('Jul16Mod', this, '#e91b63')">Modeling</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook7" onclick="openInfoBlock7('Jul16Oep', this, '#e91b63')">Gene Amplification</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook7" onclick="openInfoBlock7('Jul16Yea', this, '#e91b63')">YMC</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook7" onclick="openInfoBlock7('Jul16Bio', this, '#e91b63')">Biobrick &amp; Terminator</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook7" onclick="openInfoBlock7('Jul16Rib', this, '#e91b63')">Riboswitch</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook7" onclick="openInfoBlock7('Jul16Oth', this, '#e91b63')">Other</BUTTON><DIV id="Jul16Ove" class="buttoncontent7"><P>About half the team spent the week drafting our thesis.

                 Four of our team members and our PI took a vacation to Minneapolis that wasn’t much of a vacation at all. The small group toured Medtronic's Operational Headquarters, Physiological Research Laboratories, and the University of Minnesota's Visible Heart Lab. Almost every other second of the trip was spent on the BMES Coulter College Conference, which required teams to come up with a medical solution to a need. Our team focused on hypertension in resource-constrained settings and developed a solution in the form of a blood-pressure-monitoring phone case and app. Even after the conference, the fivesome was hard at work; they met with the University of Minnesota iGEM team, toured their lab, and gave advice about human practices, outreach, and fundraising. </P></DIV><DIV id="Jul30Gib" class="buttoncontent9"><P>The first step to prepare for Gibson Assembly was to linearize pUC19 and pXRL2 via PCR. We performed PCR Over the course of this week we had bands in strange and random locations. We were led to believe our plasmids were not what we believed them to be.

We first created a stock of ampicillin selective plates with a concentration of 100ug/mL. We carried out a transformation with NEB DH5α chemicompetent cells and created a glycerol stock of leftover cells after plating. We plated out transformants on 3 plates at original strength, 10-fold, and 100-fold dilutions using glass beads. Our platings were successful, and we used the 100-fold dilution plate to isolate single colonies and create a monoclonal culture of transformants. We also learned how to plate with a sterile wire loop in order to keep the number of plates used to a minimum. Every protocol--pouring plates, transformations, platings, and creating glycerol stocks--was new to us and required some reading of protocols from NEB and other sources.</P></DIV><DIV id="Jul30Oth" class="buttoncontent9"><P>Created 80% glycerol freeze stocks of four <I>S. cerevisiae</I> strains obtains from the Heinrich lab at UCSC.

We attempted this a third time by tossing out flow-throughs between each step of the miniprep procedure and obtained workable plasmid samples for pXRL2 and pUC19. 
Primers came in and were rehydrated. 
We performed our first attempt to PCR amplify out the <I>ade2</I> homologous arms from <I>Y. lipolytica</I> using colony PCR. No amplification was observed.

                 Unfortunately, with great numbers of people in lab comes great margin for mistake. We burnt through a ridiculous amount of Q5 polymerase this week because we miscommunicated the concentrations needed to perform PCR.

Our next digest, performed with our most recently acquired enzyme, showed the expected band pattern after altering the contrast on the gel image. We also attempted a PCR linearization of our amplified plasmid which was unsuccessful. Through these experiments we learned how to better analyze gel images by increasing exposure, brightness, and contrast, as well as proper incubation practices for liquid cultures.

We tried one more time using only 10 uL water to elute and got sufficient concentrations for our Gibson reactions.</P></DIV><DIV id="Aug13Rib" class="buttoncontent12"><P>This was the week in which we discovered our collective error in the PCR protocol we had used up until this point. This was a lesson to us and the rest of the team about blindly following protocols without questioning them.

Whew. A few of us began reorganizing the information we needed to write about to make the paper more clear. We also had a meeting at the end of the week about expectations for writing during the coming week.
After finding out about the IRB, we applied for exemption. We then found out that we would have to revise our questionnaires. Appropriate changes were made and the application was submitted again (this happens several more times in the next week or so). 
Some of us considered different design and selectable marker options to test integration of genes into the yeast genome. We learned that one of our steps lacks a reliable selectable marker test, but that replica plating may provide sufficient levels of certainty. 
Our several lab groups worked tirelessly to make more media, to check for deletions in plasmids, and to design primers that actually work. </P></DIV><DIV id="Aug20Gib" class="buttoncontent13"><P>Now that we have <I>lox-URA3-lox</I>, linearized pUC19, and amplified homologous arms, we are able to begin Gibson Assembly. We did two gibsons this week. The first Gibson includes the parts mentioned above and the second is our linearized pXRL2 along with several gene fragments: ADR, FDX, Delta7H, p450SCC, and 3BH. After combining the neccessary components with the Gibson Master Mix, we put it in the PCR machine for an hour and then stored it on ice. The following day we inoculated the gibson products on high copy LB-AMP plates. The pUC19 plate grew normally but the pXRL2 plate lawned. 
We then picked colonies from the pUC19 plate and transformed it in liquid cultures. We then performed colony PCR to check if our Gibson assembly was successful. It likely did not work. The gel showed very bright bands in the wrong areas but a faint band where our desired product would be. With this information, we made streak plates of the potential successful colonies in hopes to isolate what we believe to be our desired gibson product and threw the rest of the cultures out.</P></DIV><DIV id="Aug20Rib" class="buttoncontent13"><P>After a successful test reaction at 10uL, we repeated our linearization PCR with a volume of 50uL. Our confirmation gel indicated a successful linearization, although some of the sample streaked above the 10 kb ladder. 
We then attempted a transformation of our new chemicompetent <I>Y. lipolytica</I> using our control D17 plasmid. Our transformant cells were then incubated in liquid selective media for outgrowth. We also attempted a transformation of our linearized PCR product from the 50 uL reaction, but later realized that the linearized plasmid was unfit for expression of any genes at this point and so the transformation plate was discarded. </P></DIV><DIV id="Aug20Oth" class="buttoncontent13"><P>Created YNB+CSM-Leu medium (leucine-deficient) and YNBcasa (uracil-deficient) medium.

We received an invitation to speak at TEDx! This is exciting. We get to tell people about our project, but we also get to bring more attention to the unmet need for modern contraceptives! Our team is really happy about the opportunity to present on such a large platform. 
In lab, we had some successful yeast and bacteria transformations, some successful Gibsons, and confirmed <I>Y. lipolytica’s</I> antibiotic resistance. 
We also finally received IRB exemption for our questionnaires! This means we can now officially use our questionnaires to gather information about the women who may not have adequate access to modern contraceptives.</P></DIV><DIV id="Aug27Rib" class="buttoncontent14"><P>After outgrowth in liquid selective media, our cultures repeatedly failed to show colonies when plated on selective media.

Our E. coli amplification, however, showed no growth. It was found that this was because of an error in the media used. To save time, we thawed our previous glycerol stock of transformed cells and used it to inoculate a culture for outgrowth and plasmid isolation. DNA yields of this culture were lower than previous amplifications. We reasoned that this was due to the glycerol stock not having been plated on selective media before freezing. This would have resulted in some population of non-transformants existing in the stock and lowering plasmid yields. To remedy this, we plated our glycerol stock on selective media to isolate colonies and inoculated cultures with these colonies. We left these cultures to incubate over the weekend. 
We began PCR experiments to amplify our riboswitch inserts in anticipation of our Gibson Assembly trials. Trials initially showed mixed results, which was perplexing since all PCR trials used the same primers and overhangs, but were confirmed as successful on 0.8% agarose gels by the end of the week. Nanodrop analysis gave the following concentrations of PCR products in the table below. 
We also began out first Gibson Assembly experiments with our amplified inserts and linearized plasmid backbone. After this, we used PCR to confirm the presence of our pOPPY_GFP plasmids by using two of our Sanger sequencing primers and running the generated amplicons against a ladder on a 1.5% agarose gel. We also attempted a series of transformations of E. coli using our 5 Gibson Assembly products. 
We also sent off our first samples for Sanger sequencing at the UC Berkeley DNA sequencing facility. With results coming in at the end of the week. Our reads indicated that our GFP gene was functional with no detected SNPs that would hinder our experiments.</P></DIV><DIV id="Sep3Oth" class="buttoncontent15"><P>We did our first yeast miniprep to test the effectiveness of our outlined miniprep procedures. The resulting Nanodrop curve was ragged and lacked the attributes of plasmid DNA. We tried again to miniprep yeast, this time washing the glass beads multiple times to get rid of residual isopropanol. The results were much better: a DNA curve. Still, there was an unknown source of salt contamination in the plasmid sample.</P></DIV><P class="section-title week" id="Sep10"><SPAN style="font-size: 150%">Week of September 10th</SPAN></P><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook16" onclick="openInfoBlock16('Sep10Ove', this, '#e91b63')" id="defaultOpen16">Overview</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook16" onclick="openInfoBlock16('Sep10Gib', this, '#e91b63')">Gibson Assembly</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook16" onclick="openInfoBlock16('Sep10Mod', this, '#e91b63')">Modeling</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook16" onclick="openInfoBlock16('Sep10Oep', this, '#e91b63')">Gene Amplification</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook16" onclick="openInfoBlock16('Sep10Yea', this, '#e91b63')">YMC</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook16" onclick="openInfoBlock16('Sep10Bio', this, '#e91b63')">Biobrick &amp; Terminator</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook16" onclick="openInfoBlock16('Sep10Rib', this, '#e91b63')">Riboswitch</BUTTON><BUTTON class="buttonnotebook16" onclick="openInfoBlock16('Sep10Oth', this, '#e91b63')">Other</BUTTON><DIV id="Sep10Oth" class="buttoncontent16"><P>We attempted a yeast plasmid miniprep yet again, this time using S. cerevisiae containing a backbone pXRL2 connected to five progesterone pathway genes.
