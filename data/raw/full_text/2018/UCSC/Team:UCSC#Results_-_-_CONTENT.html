FKP393</I>, we lysed the cells and extracted the gDNA. We then performed touchdown PCR with the gDNA and confirmed the amplification of the HAs with gel electrophoresis. The UHA is 1014 bases long, and the DHA is 1000 bases long, so we expected bands at ~1 kb for both PCR samples. Figure 1, shows the expected bands just above 1 kb. It is likely that the bands are above 1 kb because the loaded samples contain Q5 reaction buffer and ran slower than the 2-log DNA ladder. We concluded that the bands produced were from the HAs. We sent the PCR products to be sequenced with primers that would identify regions of the homology arms and were able to confirm that our product were the HAs.</P><DIV class="imageCont floatC"><P><B>Figure 1</B>: Gel of Upstream and Downstream HAs, 1% TBE gel electrophoresis of the upstream and downstream HA PCR amplifications.

We performed GA using 1:10 molar ratio of plasmid backbone to insert, and transformed NEB 5-alpha <I>E. coli</I> with the product, and grew them on high copy LB/AMP plates for 14 hours at 37ºC. The <I>E. coli</I> plates grew colonies, shown below.</P><DIV class="imageCont floatC"><P><B>Figure 1</B>: pOPPY-UC19-yX transformed in NEB 5-alpha E.coli grown on LB/AMP high copy plate.</P></DIV><P>We picked 12 colonies, with which we performed colony PCR, and created an index plate. Our colony PCR gel results indicated that the colonies we chose were not homogenous; while some colonies showed light bands at the appropriate size for pOPPY-UC19-yXXU (~4 kb), they also contained other bands around 0.5kb which is the size expected if there is no insert, and just pUC19 backbone.</P><DIV class="imageCont floatC"><P><B>Figure 1</B>: 1% agarose gel containing samples from colony PCR of pOPPY-UC19-yXXU attempting to detect <I>loxP-ura3-lox71</I> geneblock with homology arms to ade2.</P></DIV><P>The gel shows that we may have a mixed population in our colony picks. While there are light bands at 4kb, the bright bands at 0.5kb show that our insert was not included in the majority of the DNA we performed the PCR on. We created streak plates with the colonies on the index plate to attempt to screen out the mutants who had not successfully assembled our insert into the backbone. Unfortunately, after PCR of those, the results returned the same information that our colonies did not include the insert. This is most likely due to the plasmid somehow re-circularizing to itself, or DPN1 not completely digesting the original pUC19 plasmid after isolation from E.coli. Because we were not able to isolate pOPPY-UC19-yXXU, we chose a different route.</P><P>The Riboswitch team has been using a plasmid called D17, generously gifted from Cory Schwartz at UC Irvine, which contains homology arms for the pseudogene D17 in <I>Y. lipolytica</I>. We decided to try and insert <I>loxP-ura3-lox71</I> into that plasmid. If successful, we would then amplify out to obtain a linear construct including the homology arms to D17, which we could perform homologous recombination into the <I>Y. lipolytica</I> genome with. We PCR amplified D17, cutting out plasmid backbone between the homology arms to create a construct with homology arms at each end of the linear product. We ordered primers with Gibson Overhangs (GO) to the D17 plasmid to amplify <I>loxP-ura3-lox71</I> with. The PCR results were unsuccessful every try. Due to these issues, we decided to use KLD to insert the loxP-URA3-lox71 gene block into D17. We performed KLD treatment with linearized D17 backbone, and the <I>loxP-URA3-lox71</I> gene block and transformed NEB 5-alpha <I>E.coli</I>. We saw many colonies, and we picked 15 for colony PCR to check if integration occurred.</P><DIV class="imageCont" style="float:center"><P><B>Figure 1</B>: 1% agarose gel containing colony PCR results from <I>loxP-URA3-lox71</I> geneblock in between D17 homology arms.</P></DIV><P>The gel shows in lane 2 that we achieved a clean, single band at ~5kb. The primers bound to the D17 plasmid at the beginning and end of the D17 homologous arms, including the arms and our loxP-URA3-lox71 insert. The expected size of our product is 3.6 kb. The band is slightly higher than this size, which we believe is due to the salts in the cell causing it to run a bit slower than it should. Because of this we are confident that this band is our desired product. We have grown a liquid culture of Colony 2, miniprepped it, and performed PCR using Q5 polymerase and the same primers used for colony PCR to attempt to amplify out loxP-URA3-lox71 sandwiched between the D17 homology arms. The results have not yet shown any bands from this.</P><P>Once we are able to amplify loxP-URA3-lox71 with D17 homology arms, we will transform <I>Y. lipolytica</I> with this linear product and confirm success by growing the colonies on uracil-deficient media. Once the loxP and lox71 sites are integrated into the genome we can perform Recombinase mediated cassette exchange with the plasmid created by YMC with all pathway genes using the corresponding lox sites.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="flex-row"><DIV class="flex-col center"><H2 id="YMC">YEAST MEDIATED CLONING</H2><P>We concluded the successful removal of loxP from pXRL2 via site directed mutagenesis. The results of our colony PCR (Figure 1) suggested that the product of the reaction was slightly smaller than the original plasmid. We sequenced to confirm our success and found that the product was missing the desired region in an alignment with the original plasmid. We also conducted attempts of yeast mediated cloning with successful growth in leucine deficient media. This result would suggest that we had a successful transformation and possible assembly of our gene cassette on to the plasmid backbone.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="flex-row"><DIV class="flex-col"><DIV class="imageCont floatC"><P><B>Figure 1</B>: With the primers used in this colony PCR reaction, we should see a fragment of about 270bp if one loxP site was successfully removed from pXLR2 and a 340bp fragment if the loxP site was not removed. We initially believed that the bright bands between 300bp and 400bp in colony 2 and 5 (marked here in green rectangles) indicated failures to remove loxP because they appeared to be the 340bp fragments. We later realized that the gel did not run evenly, as can be seen in the arc of the dark line representing the dye. This resulted in the bands appearing higher than they should have, and these two bright bands likely indicated successful removal of loxP.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="flex-row"><DIV class="flex-col center"><P>We conducted a colony PCR (Figure 1) to check the successful site directed mutagenesis of loxP from pXRL2. We used a pair of primers: cloxP F and cloxP R to amplify the region that we removed and ran the samples on a gel. A successful trial would be a band 300 bp or lower since the fragment including the lox site would be 343 bp. Our results were puzzling due to the band being higher than 300 bp but we thought that this had occurred because the sample ran slower than the other lanes evident in the arc of the dye. We conducted another colony PCR with monoclonal colonies. Strangely, our positive control appeared to be much larger than the other samples but we concluded that it was due to issues with gel electrophoresis. We resolved to use the samples with the lowest bands or smallest size which were 5C, 5D, 21B and 23A. Upon further investigation by sequencing (Figure 2), we concluded that we had succeeded due to the region being missing in an alignment with the original plasmid. However, in sample A, more bases were deleted than expected so we did not use it because of risk of a frameshift. We, then relinearized the four sequenced samples for gene assembly via yeast mediated cloning. The results of this suggested a success since the bands resulting from gel electrophoresis were at the expected 8-10 kb.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="flex-row"><DIV class="flex-col"><DIV class="imageCont floatC"><P><B>Figure 2</B>: We sequenced our relinearized samples of pOPPY-XRL2-yX and aligned the results with the original pXRL2 plasmid or negative control. The green lines indicate the successful removal of loxP by site directed mutagenesis while the red lines show the deletion of extra bases in plasmid A and 21.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="flex-row"><DIV class="flex-col"><DIV class="imageCont floatC"><P><B>Figure 3</B>: After creating a set of liquid cultures of the two colonies we believed to contain plasmids with one loxP site removed (2 and 5), we miniprepped and then ran a PCR using the same primers used in the previous colony PCR (see figure 1). A band at 270bp indicates that loxP was removed, while a band at 340bp would indicate that loxP was not removed. The PCR products of “Miniprep C from Colony 5 liquid culture” (lane 1) showed a band just below the 300bp mark, suggesting that loxP was successfully removed from the plasmid in colony 5. The band in lane 4 also appeared promising, while we felt that the slightly higher bands appearing between 300bp and 400bp in lanes 5 and 9 seemed to indicate that loxP may not have been removed from the plasmid in colony 2. Our negative control, the PCR run on the unaltered pXLR2 plasmid backbone, surprisingly showed a band between 400bp and 500bp rather than the expected 340bp. We think this could potentially be due to errors made in addition of PCR reagents to this specific sample.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="flex-row"><DIV class="flex-col"><DIV class="imageCont floatC"><P><B>Figure 4</B>: In this gel, we ran our samples that were relinearized with inverse PCR subsequent to confirming that loxP was removed. The PCR product resulting from the original plasmid shown in lane 5 appeared to be slightly higher than the pOPPY-XRL2-yX samples in lane 2, 3 and 4. This was expected since the linearization theoretically removed 230bp from the plasmid which was originally 6693bp.

We grew 30 colonies selected from leucine-deficient plates in leucine-deficient liquid media to mini-prep them and check for successful plasmid assembly. We rescued the plasmid and ran 250ng dilutions of our samples on a gel (Figure 5).

The positive controls +3, +4 and +5 are 1:10 dilutions from +2 positive control of 1mg/1mL of pure progesterone in DMSO. These positives were not subjected to the extraction protocol.
