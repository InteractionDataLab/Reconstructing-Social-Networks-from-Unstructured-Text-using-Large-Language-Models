Thank You
To everyone who has reached out to us so far. Where we are right now is so much more than just a large effort on our part. We have had so many amazing people and sponsors who have provided us with funding, analytical software, lab materials, and stories about how people in lesser developed areas personally have struggled with women's health issues. What we have done could not have been possible without the contributions of all these people.
