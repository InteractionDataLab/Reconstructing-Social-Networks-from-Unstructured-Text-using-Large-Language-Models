Thank You
The PoPPY team would like to thank everyone who made this project possible, especially those described below. For the past five years, undergraduates at UCSC have participated in iGEM. This year, the team is composed of students studying Bioengineering (Biomolecular), Bioinformatics, Bioengineering (Assistive Technology: Motor), Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Marine Biology, and Cognitive Science: Artificial Intelligence and Human Computer Interaction. Our diverse group of individuals is crucial for the creative process behind using synthetic biology to help others. Modern engineering demands collaboration between individuals and pushes them to think critically and work efficiently. Through synthetic biology, the 2018 UCSC iGEM team is solving worldwide issues and developing methods to expand their research in the future.
The Project Idea
After several journal club meetings, our team determined the PoPPY project was the most meaningful pursuit. The initial idea was proposed by captain Morgan Tardy and mentor McKenna Hicks .
Official Team
Thank you to all the 2018 UCSC iGEM Team members for their hard work and dedication to the PoPPY project's message. Check out our Meet the Team page to learn about each teammate.

Research Support
Hal Alper, Professor, University of Texas at Austin, Department of Chemical Engineering
Professor Alper provided recommendations for Tsynth27/Tsynth8 terminators and confirmed which promoters would be necessary for our project. Through a Materials Transfer Agreement, Alper sent us plasmids carrying terminators and fluorescent markers to test for gene activity.
William Belden, Associate Professor, Rutgers University, Department of Animal Sciences
Professor Belden provided valuable information on yeast-mediated cloning. Professor Belden inspired our parallel experiment design and even offered to help design our flanking oligos.
Erin Bredeweg, Biosystems Dynamics & Simula Scientist, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
Erin Bredeweg assisted us in finding sequence information on our Yarrowia lipolytica strain.
Tony Carr, Professor of Molecular Genetics, University of Sussex, Genome Damage and Stability, Genome Damage and Stability Centre
Professor Carr answered our questions regarding the size of genomic insert, directionality of Lox sites, and cre-lox recombination.
Catherine Duport, University of Avignon, Microbiotechnology, Ecotoxicology, and Bioremediation
Catherine Duport helped clarify pieces of her 1998 experiment such as why certain promoters and genes were chosen. Duport also attempted to find us a Yarrowia lipolytica strain.
Daniel Gallie, Professor, University of California Riverside, Biochemistry Department
Professor Gallie sent us an electroporation protocol with mRNA for reference.
Marc Gartenberg, Professor, Rutgers University, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Professor Gartenberg provided information on parts of pXRU3/L2 plasmid including HOp region, CEN/ARS regions, pRS marker, and how to insert Lox sites into these particular plasmids.
Rohinton Kamakaka, Professor, University of California Santa Cruz, Department of Molecular Cellular and Developmental Biology
Professor Kamakaka sent us protocols on yeast-mediated cloning. He also answered questions on growing and maintaining yeast and even provided us a Saccharomyces Cerevisiae strain for yeast-mediated cloning. Professor Kamakaka has also provided general support and advice for all our experiments.
Oliver Konzock, PhD Student, Chalmers University, Life Science Engineering
Oliver Konzock answered questions on how to grow yeast (and care for Yarrowia lipolytica). He also answered questions on how to successfully perform yeast-mediated cloning.
Jah Nehlin, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre
Mehlin gave insight into how the GAL1 promoter works.
Jean-Marc Nicaud, Directeur de Recherche INRA
Jean-Marc Nicaud introduced us to the Golden Gate Assembly method. He also answered questions about building plasmids and showed us M1G1 wouldn't be an issue in terms of our promoter/terminator design.
Saumya Ramarao, Senior Associate, Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition
Ramarao provided information regarding birth control production and needs.
Hans Ronne, Professor, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Department of Forest Mycology and Plant Pathology
Professor Ronne attempted to determine how to stop the binding of MIG1 to GALI promoter.
Cory Schwartz, PhD Student, University of California Riverside, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering
Schwartz provided pHR_AO8_hrGFP plasmid sequence that includes homologous arm regions.
Wendy Sun, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Department of Chemical Biochemical and Environmental Engineering
Sun assisted Xu in proving that Yarrowia lipolytica could produce progesterone.
Stefan Tippmann, Visiting Researcher, Chalmers University, Life Science Engineering
Tippmann taught us about yeast in general and providing us with additional readings to learn about Yarrowia lipolytica.
Adam Watson, Research Fellow, University of Sussex, Genome Damage and Stability
Watson answered questions regarding the size of genomic inserts, directionality of Lox sites, and Cre-lox recombination.
Ian Wheeldon, Associate Professor, University of California Riverside, Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering
Wheeldon provided the pHR_AO8_hrGFP plasmid sequence that includes homologous arm regions.
Peng Xu, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Department of Chemical Biochemical and Environmental Engineering
Xu proved that Yarrowia lipolytica could produce progesterone despite its NHEJ preference. He showed that it is possible to use homologous recombination with a KU70 knockout strain.
