Overview
     Our project "Plant B" aims to regulate microbiota. With the help of antimicrobial peptides, we can achieve our goal to inhibit specific bacteria strains. Therefore, we attempt to produce antimicrobial peptides by E. coli.
     We designed BioBricks of antimicrobial peptides, then several experiments were done to test their functions and prove that our system can really work. We provided a collection of antimicrobial peptides and all the new BioBricks had been submitted to the registry of iGEM.
