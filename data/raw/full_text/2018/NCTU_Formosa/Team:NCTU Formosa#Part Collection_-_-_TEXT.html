Composite Parts
     Bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides naturally produced by bacteria themselves, meaning they already are present in the environment. They are incredibly specific to bacteria and degrade quickly, posing no risk to any organism other than our targets. Additionally, they are stable over wide ranges of pH and temperature, making them perfect for use in soil. Through minimum inhibitory concentration assays, we demonstrate the functionality of our BioBricks. They can then be used as bio-stimulators in our intelligent farming system. Combined with machine learning and artificial intelligence, our bacteriocins allow us to generate an extremely accurate microbiota prediction model, paving the way to efficient and effective control over bacterial distribution in soil.
