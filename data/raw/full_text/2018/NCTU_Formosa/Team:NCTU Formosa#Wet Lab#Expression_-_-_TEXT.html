Protein Expression
Cloning
     To ensure our target genes were successfully cloned into the pSB1C3 backbone, we ran the electrophoresis of Taq PCR products to check the sizes of the insert genes.
All of the sequences contained T7 promoter, RBS, bacteriocin, intein and CBD, were shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Our BioBrick design
     After amplification with PCR, all the PCR products' lengths are around 1200 b.p. The exact lengths are listed in Table 1.

     The figure 2 is electrophoresis results of the PCR products with marker on the left side and target gene on the right side. The lengths are labeled beside each band.

Protein Expression
     After the expression from E. coli BL21 Rosetta-gami, we had to check whether the proteins were successfully expressed. We broke E. coli with sonication and ran SDS-PAGE to check the correct sizes of the target proteins. The mass of each protein is presented in Table 2.

     The gel of SDS-PAGE results were shown below. The mass of intein-CBD tag is 28 kDa. Therefore, all the results showed the initial mass of each bacteriocin plus the mass of intein-CBD tag. From SDS-PAGE results, we could confirm the production of target peptides.

EA: Leucocyclicin Q + intein + CBD (BBa_K2599014, 34.4 kDa) EB: Enterocin B + intein + CBD (BBa_K2599011, 35.5 kDa) EC: Bovicin HJ50 + intein + CBD (BBa_K2599009, 34.25 kDa) ED: Enterocin 96 + intein + CBD (BBa_K2599012, 35.9 kDa) EE: Lacticin Z + intein + CBD (BBa_K2599013, 33.9 kDa) EF: Durancin TW-49M + intein + CBD(BBa_K2599015, 35.3 kDa)
Protein Purification
     Finally, we added 1,4-dithiothreitol(DTT) to purify bacteriocins from intein-CBD tag(28 kDa). The result is shown as below. We used Enterocin B as representative. The result showed that we could successfully purify bacteriocin.
