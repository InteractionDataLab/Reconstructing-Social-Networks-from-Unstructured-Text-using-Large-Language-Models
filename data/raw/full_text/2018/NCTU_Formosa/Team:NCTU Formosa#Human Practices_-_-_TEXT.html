Overview
     Human practices serve as a means of communicating our goals with the public and are vital to the success of only our project but also synthetic biology as an industry. To spread awareness about synthetic biology and iGEM, we hosted and participated in several events to educate people and spark interest in the field. In addition to education and public engagement, we also investigated expert opinion regarding our project as well as consult authorities on both soil microbiota and the agriculture industry as part of our integrated human practices.
