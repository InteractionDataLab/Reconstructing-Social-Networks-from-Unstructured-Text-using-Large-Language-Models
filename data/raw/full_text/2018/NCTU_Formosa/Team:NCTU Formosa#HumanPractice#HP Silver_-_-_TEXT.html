Central China Conference Conference
In mid-July, our team visited Wuhan, China to participate in the 2018 Central China Regional Exchange iGEM Conference, which was held by HUST, to share our project with other teams. This year, five teams came together to discuss and exchange ideas. We presented our project ideas and the audience gave us some great feedback. During the question and answer section we were asked about some topics that we hadn’t considered, such as the cost of our bacteriocin production. Additionally, we saw some interesting topics presented by other teams, and also made some great friends along the way. Overall this event really helped us prepare a more well-rounded project!
Little Conference in NCTU
Towards the end of July we co-hosted a small iGEM meetup with Mingdao High School. Along with National Tsing Hua University, all three teams presented their projects. This was our second opportunity to share our ideas with other iGEM teams and receive criticism. The improvements we’d made after our first meetup in Wuhan made our project more understandable this time; of course, we were asked new questions that we’d yet to consider, such as how long our proteins would last in the environment. We found that the smaller scale of this meetup allowed for longer and more intimate discussions and really helped us identify some issues with our project. We were very lucky that Mingdao approached us with this amazing chance at improvement, and hope the other two schools benefitted as much as we did!
6th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference
This summer, NCTU_Formosa participated in the 6th annual Asia Pacific iGEM conference held at Chung Shing University in Taichung. Over twenty other teams attended the event, and each team took the opportunity to share their projects. We received a lot of constructive criticism from not only other students but teachers and advisors as well. From this, we were able to improve both our content as well as our presentation style. Additionally, we bonded with many other teams and schools and made long lasting friendships.
Phone Meetup (Abu Dhabi)
During the spring our team called Abu Dhabi over Skype to discuss both teams’projects. We explained our plan to control microbiota in soil, and Abu Dhabi shared their goals of making an incredible sensor. It was a great opportunity to practice expressing our ideas to others, and both teams learned more about both projects.
