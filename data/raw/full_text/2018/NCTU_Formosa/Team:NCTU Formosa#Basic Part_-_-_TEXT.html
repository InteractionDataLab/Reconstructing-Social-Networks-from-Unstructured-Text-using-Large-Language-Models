Basic Parts
     This year we decided to design six basic parts. These parts contain the single sequence of each antimicrobial peptide. They all show the inhibition function against Bacillus subtilis, which is one of the example of our system. We listed all the basic parts we constructed below.
Bacteriocins
Bovicin HJ50(BBa_K2599001)
Enterocin B(BBa_K2599003)
Enterocin 96(BBa_K2599004)
Lacticin Z(BBa_K2599005)
Leucocyclicin Q(BBa_K2599006)
Durancin TW-49M(BBa_K2599007)
     To check out our composite parts containing genes of bacteriocins, curcumin biosensor, and improvements, please click the button below to learn more!
