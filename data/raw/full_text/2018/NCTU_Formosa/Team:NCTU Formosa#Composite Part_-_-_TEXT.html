Composite Parts
     We tried to express the six antimicrobial peptides by E. coli. These composite parts contain the coding sequence, RBS, a T7 promoter, and also intein and CBD sequences for better purification.
     The other composite part contains each basic part from NCTU_Formosa 2016. We found this peptide also shows its ability to inhibit Bacillus subtilis.
