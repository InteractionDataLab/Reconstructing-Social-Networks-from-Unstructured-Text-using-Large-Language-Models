Team: NTHU_Formosa
Troubleshooting -- Wiki course
     On August 23th, we prepared a wiki course for NTHU_Formosa, helping them to troubleshoot on their difficulties of writing their wiki. First of all, we taught them the concept and process of designing a website as an introduction.  Second, we introduced how to use HTML, CSS, as well as  JavaScript. Third, we helped them to build up a simple RWD website step by step to make them more familiar with the web languages. Finally, we gave them some tips and advices on editing their wiki. We’re really happy about having such a chance to share our knowledge with other iGEM teams! Hope the course could help them in a meaningful way. We’re looking forward to have further collaboration with NTHU_Formosa.

Characterization of Parts from NTHU_Formosa
     We characterize the part of NTHU_Formosa team. These inserted vectors, including pCAG-GBP , pTRE3G-LuxAB, pCMV-LuxCDEfrp, pTRE3G-mCherry , are to produce receptor, enzyme, substrate, which are essential in the process of emitting the light. We helped with NTHU_Formosa to check if these vectors are correct. The results in the figure below shows these vectors are connected correctly.

Bidirectional collaboration with NTHU_Formosa
     After inducing our E. coli, we wanted double check that our constructs were correctly expressed. To do this, we invited members of team NTHU_Formosa to come to our lab on October 6th, where they spent an afternoon running an SDS-PAGE of Enterocin B and Enterocin 96. The results are shown in the figures below. Thanks to NTHU_Formosa’s help, we confirmed that our peptides were being expressed correctly.
