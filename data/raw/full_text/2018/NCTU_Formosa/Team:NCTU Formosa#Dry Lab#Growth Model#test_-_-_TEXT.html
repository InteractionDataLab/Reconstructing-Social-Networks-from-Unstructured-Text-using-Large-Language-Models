Overview
Figure1: Growth model progress
     Excess soluble phosphates are the result of excess Bacillus subtilis (and other PSBs) in soil. Bacteriocins present a natural and effective way of inhibiting growth of B. subtilis, but we must first know how fast the subtilis in soil is growing as well as how much to kill. To start, we researched the growth of subtilis, as well as bacteria in general, to get an idea of how our target grows in soil. As we were unable to find any literature that specifically models the growth of bacteria in soil, we decided to create a modified basic growth curve of B. subtilis by considering the most important soil factors that would affect its growth. After consulting with soil microbiomes expert Professor Young of National Chung Hsing University, we determined the factors that influence B. subtilis growth the greatest are temperature, pH and salinity. To model the effects that these different conditions have on B. subtilis growth, we observed the relationship between each individual factor and B. subtilis.
Temperature to Bacteria Growth Curve
Figure2: Temperature growth curve model progress
For temperature, we began with the Ratkowsky equation, which describes effect of temperature on general bacterial growth rate, modeled as
$$R_{temp}(T)=a\cdot[(T-T_{min})\cdot(1-e^{(b\cdot(T-T_{max}))})]^2$$
To modify this curve into a B. subtilis-specific model, we cultured B. subtilis at different temperatures to identify the unknown parameters a and b.
$$T_{min}=284K;\:  T_{max}=326K;\:  a=1.915\cdot 10^{-5};\:  b=0.105$$
To simulate the growth of B. subtilis under certain conditions, we use Logistic regression function here
$$Logistic\: Function:\: f(t)=\frac{C}{1+A\cdot e^{-B\cdot t}}$$
Then we combine the growth rate under certain condition with Logistic regression function
$$f(R_{temp},t)=\frac{C}{1+A\cdot e^{-R_{temp}\cdot t}}$$

Our final equation models how B. subtilis grows under different temperature conditions.
pH to Bacteria Growth Curve
Figure4: pH growth curve model progress
As with temperature, the pH model began as a general equation describing bacterial growth rate under different pH values. We started with the cardinal pH equation
$$R_{pH}(pH)=\frac{c\cdot(pH-pH_{min})\cdot(pH-pH_{max})}{d\cdot((pH-pH_{min})\cdot(pH-pH_{max})-e\cdot(pH-pH_{opt})^2)}$$
Again, we cultured B. subtilis in different pH solutions to find the parameter values specific to our target. The resulting equation is
$$pH_{min}=3.3;\:  pH_{max}=9.72;\:  pH_{opt}=5.82;\:  c=1.97\cdot 10^{-4};\:  d=0.4035;\:  e=8.054\cdot 10^{-4}$$
To simulate the growth of B. subtilis under certain conditions, we use Logistic regression function here
$$Logistic\: Function:\: f(t)=\frac{C}{1+A\cdot e^{-B\cdot t}}$$
Then we combine the growth rate under certain condition with Logistic regression function
$$f(R_{pH},t)=\frac{C}{1+A\cdot e^{-R_{pH}\cdot t}}$$

This model accounts for any effects that changes in pH may have on B. subtilis growth in soil.
Salinity to Bacteria Growth Curve
Figure6: Salinity growth curve model progress
For salinity, we discovered that a simple logistic growth curve was enough to serve as our base equation. According to our references, we derived the equation describing bacterial growth rate under different salinity, model as
$$R_{sal}(sal)=(f\cdot sal^2)+(g\cdot sal)+h$$
Culturing B. subtilis in different salinities yielded the following specific parameters in the equation:
$$f=-7.617\cdot 10^{-3};\:  g=1.853\cdot 10^{-3};\:  h=1.24\cdot 10^{-2}$$
To simulate the growth of B. subtilis under certain conditions, we use Logistic regression function here
$$Logistic\: Function:\: f(t)=\frac{C}{1+A\cdot e^{-B\cdot t}}$$
Then we combine the growth rate under certain condition with Logistic regression function
$$f(R_{sal},t)=\frac{C}{1+A\cdot e^{-R_{sal}\cdot t}}$$

This yields the final piece of our bacterial soil growth model, and explains any consequences of shifts in salinity of our soil.
Complete Growth Curve Model
Figure8: Merge growth curve model progress
     With our three factors all accounted for, we needed to identify the weights of each factor ($\alpha,\beta,\gamma$) before merging the equations we found into one model. To do this, we randomly selected 3 sets of different temperature, pH and salinity and input the growth results into Simulink program, model as
$$f^*=\alpha\cdot f(R_{temp},t)+\beta\cdot f(R_{pH},t)+\gamma\cdot f(R_{sal},t)$$
Simulate growth curve of B. subtilis under muilti-factor of 37°C, pH=7.0, and 0.17mM salinity.
     Through this we could determine how much impact each factor has on B. subtilis growth relative to the other two factors and adjust the parameters accordingly. Our resulting combined model has the ability to predict B. subtilis growth rate under a wide range of temperature, pH and salinity.
