Attribution & Acknowledgement
We would like to thank all those who have helped us through the past year, not only for making our project possible but also for making it memorable.
Tsing Hua University
Mr Xuan Wang provided day-to-day instruction in the lab as well as expertise on project designing.
Ms Yiqing Zhao provided day-to-day instruction in the lab.
Mr Jianwen Ye provided insights on biosafety problems. He talked about the problem and benefits of the program according to his expertise. He also imparts wisdom into a model design for the fermentor.
Peking University
Prof. Ping Wei, Prof Qi Ouyang, Dr Haoqian Zhang, provided opportunities for us to attend lessons on synthetic biology at Peking University.
Dr.Haoqian Zhang gave us crucial advise on the project design
Ms Yiming Dong gave us advice on integrase design and debug
Mr Yihao Zhang, kindly provided 96-well plates, black with the clear flat bottom, for the Interlab Study.
Prof. Zhongwei Jia in the medical college of Peking University provided essential reagents for team’s wet lab.
BFSUICC-China
Their team leader, Yingqi Ma, helped us writing a handout on synthetic biology for high school students.
Stanford University
Mr Yiming Huang kindly provided suggestions on model refining.
Shenzhen College of International Education
Xinyue Huang and Junhan Liao kindly provided their website template to us.
Selwyn College, Cambridge
Mr Honghao Su designed the sRNA system in our circuit.
Centres for disease control and prevention
Pro. Chai Fangmeng straightly points out the basic problem in the hospital and society. Give us supports and suggestions about the program.
Team RDFZ-China
Zeyu Tang, Shan Jian and Yuze Cao designed the whole circuit together. Specifically, Zeyu Tang and Shan Jian designed the thermoregulatory gene network and quorum sensing network as well as acoustic network collaboratively. Yuze Cao designed the recombinase and integrase circuit after doing substantial research.
All the team members have participated in the wet lab experiment.
