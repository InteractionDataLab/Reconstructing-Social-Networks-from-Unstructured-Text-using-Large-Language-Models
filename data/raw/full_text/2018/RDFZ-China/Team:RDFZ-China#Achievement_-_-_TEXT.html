We are striving to do the best integrated human practices program for our human practice works centred around the topic of biosafety. We investigated the current state of the rather obscure biohacker community, its self-regulations, the various laws about the distribution and import of biological products, and the actual situations on the purchase and sale of dangerous biological products in China. We concluded that there exist substantial security risk associated with them, confirmed by our interview with the station director of the centre of disease control and prevention, who opines that the outflow of biological agents can be hugely destructive to ecosystems. We proposed that beyond legal solutions, culture should also be emphasized in addressing the risks aforementioned, yet at the foremost this is the reason for our project on preventing the leakage of bacteria. We also conducted interviews with a chief engineer of Bluepha company about these problems, and found that our project has great prospects for further development;
We are striving to do the best of education and public engagement for our iGEM team originated from our school's synthetic biology club, and we used the club as a base for our works of public engagement. We focused on the community development, and we held a biosafety panel session in a high school iGEM meet up, in which we had former iGEMers, current iGEMer who was running the lab and lab manager from a university lab, to discuss how to propagate biosafety considerations into the existing Chinese Synbio community. Also, we gathered Biology Olympians from all over China, to discuss the future of high school academic communities. We had always believed in that the solution to all kinds of complicated circumstances, such as biosafety threat to the society, has to be the cultivation of academic and safety cultures to the public, and such farming has to start from ourselves, the iGEMers, striving to be the conscientious members of the current community;
We are striving to do the best modelling works for We proposed a deterministic ordinary differential equation set, which is sufficient to describe the quorum sensing regulation of a bacteria population. By using numerical methods to simultaneously solve these three concise and easily comprehensible modelling equations, we have successfully derived at a concentration interval for the amount of extracellular acyl homoserine lactone required in the fermenter in order to maintain a high enough concentration of PhlF protein to suppress the expression of nuclease and maintain the survival of engineered bacteria both at the start of and during the fermentation process. The result from Matlab simulation,1E-10M [AHL] corresponds well with that from wet lab experiments,1E-9M [AHL]. Using the experimental data, we adjusted the model, concluded that the difference might be the effect of plasmid copy number. We will improve the model according to the data, and come out with an acceptable concentration range. This information would be handy for workers at the fermentation industry to ensure their biosafety-directed bacteria to always survive inside the fermenter;
We are striving to do the best measurement for by using a capacity monitor described by a nature article, which is a constantly expressed GFP in the genome, we can characterize the resource consumption by heterologous gene constructs, through the changes in GFP production in the genome comparing to the ones without heterologous protein expressed. We characterized several devices reported to be high resource consuming, which provides other users to consider their resource occupation quantitatively, and improve the future devices' orthogonality and robustness;
