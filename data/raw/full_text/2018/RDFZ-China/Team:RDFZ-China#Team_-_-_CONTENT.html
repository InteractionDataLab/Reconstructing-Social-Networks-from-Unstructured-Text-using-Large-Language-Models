I am doing project design through phyllomancy, TAD(Tarot Assisted Design) of circuits, wet lab experiments and data processing through astromancy, report writing with chirognomy and collaboration with the help of ichthyomancy. Outside biology, I do enjoy playing football or use my phone to play table tennis. Last time my 23andMe result showed that I have a high chance of balding, I do have naturally curled hair even the seq analysis did not say so. It is interesting to cooperate across cities, I do hope we can make something remarkable with my teammates.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="teamateslight"><DIV class="introduction"><P style="line-height:20px;font-size:25px;font-family:'Avenir'">Yuze Cao</P><P style="line-height:23px;font-size:16px;font-family:'Avenir'">I am Yuze Cao from the High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, Grade 12 student.

This year, I myself as a senior student want to pay more and achieve more than did in last year. To be grateful, I am still enjoying my survival as an IB student, still have a full head of hair, still sleep for six or seven hours, but it won’t be so true after 2018 iGem.

Currently, I make electronic music, go on long-distance runs, do workouts, and try to help as much people as I can by teaching, but sometimes I seem a little bit “nerdy” and serious (especially when doing work). This is my first year participating in iGEM, and I look forward to make it rock together!

The competition experience last year benefited myself a lot in learning synthetic biology and basic experimental operation skills, meeting with friends that share same interest, and communicating with professors and predecessors in Jamboree. I show great motivation in exploring biological subjects, and I also expect to learn from and communicate with my amazing team members this year. Comparing to 2017, I am more knowledgeable in biology and facing heavier academic challenges. Hope I can still achieve progresses in 2018 iGEM without regret. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="teamateslight"><DIV class="introduction"><P style="line-height:20px;font-size:25px;font-family:'Avenir'">Jingqi Chen</P><P style="line-height:25px;font-size:16px;font-family:'Avenir'">

This is my first experience in International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition, and there is no doubt that I’m pretty excited about it. Here, I’m responsible for designing Wiki page, mathematical modeling, and doing experimental work. I love STEM competitions and research programs, and I have a basic understanding of synthetic biology theoretically and experimentally. My dream is to do engineering as my future career, and right now, I’m taking baby steps towards it. Needless to say, I wish to learn a lot from my teammates. Hard work and flawless cooperation are important for whatever our future majors might be.
                    Hope we can win! Hope we gain best from our effort. Hope we all run towards the daybreak frontline!

You might find my name a bit difficult for the tongue, but I’m sure you’ll get the hang of it soon enough, with some practice. I am generally obsessed with certain arthropods and programming (which are two things that don’t seem to stick to each other at all), but recently I found genetic engineering equally charming (yay, something else that doesn’t seem to stick to the other two). This is my first time participating in iGem, as well as a first time taking part in a year-long team project that works with microbes. Thankfully, my teammates are all awesome people, so I have already learned much from them, and probably will learn even more in the future. You will see me on my laptop a lot this year as I’m also working with one of our team leaders to construct our wiki webpage apart from my normal duties as a team member.

I’m captivated by the bold idea of designing and assembling biological components in synthetic biology – it motivates me to search for the fundamental principles of biology and their real-world applications. As a high school senior, there’s still so much I have to learn, and I’m excited to continue my quest in the undergraduate years.
                    A final thought: We have the most passionate and talented young people working on the team this year. I believe that the experience will serve as an inspiration for our future endeavors, even if outside of STEM fields. Let’s rock, my friends!
