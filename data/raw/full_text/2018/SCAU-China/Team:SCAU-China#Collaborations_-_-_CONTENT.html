           We were invited to Shenzhen University (SZU) to attend the
 iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting. The meeting was divided into three parts: project presentation, Q&amp;A and free discussion. We gathered together to discuss the feasibility of the project, checked whether the ideas were flawed,came up with many insightful and helpful suggestions.  
 
        
            In this meeting we met different teams from different universities, and established the foundation of collaborations and communications with other teams.
It was the first time that our project was displayed when the chassis we choosed was Medicago sativa, and Sinorhizobium meliloti. It was a hard time that we could find no way out our project design.
  
       The iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting brought us a lot, this period of exprience nearly changed the whole project design of our team.

It was a great opportunity for us to know more about other teams’ projects and learn from each other, such as TUST-China, they introduced their project to us, and we found that both of us chased the production optimization of bacterial cellulose, one of the difference between our projects was the chassis we choosed as bioreactor. We went on selecting suitable organisms to modify, and the new project design come into being.</P><P>We have well established the connections with some of the teams which bring us helpful collaborations and support for our CUIPD project. In addition, it was useful to talk to other teams to exchange experience on poster design, oral presentation and human practice skills.</P></DIV><DIV class="DBoard" id="title">

            We went to the Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) to meet with the two teams there: SYSU-China and SYSU-Software. At the beginning of the establishment of their teams, we exchanged experience in recruiting, teaming, projecting, and training. We also learned that the SYSU provided a comprehensive set of training courses to improve the experimental skills and abilities of team members It inspired us that we seek help from our university for providing such kinds of training for our team. The university offered a seris of useful safety courses and trainings for us as we mentioned in the safety section

            Since the modeling of SYSU-Software strongly interested us, our team had established a long-term cooperation with SYSU-Software, made many face-to-face communications, and discussed in depth of the development trends of synthetic biology and the potential application fields. In addition, SYSU-Software was invited to our college to deliver a presentation and demonstration of the software they developed. We have leart a lot from their project and they also gave us many constructive suggestions on develoing our computer modeling.

           Under the leadership of Haoqian Zhang, our three schools got the opportunity to meet and exchange. Yihao Zhang, the captain of PKU iGEM, showed us the growth and achievements of Peking from its establishment to the present. Chen nan, the captain of the SCUT iGEM also showed the process from prototype to formation. During the meeting, we have formed a clearer concept about iGEM and have a better understanding of the game.

    Members of SUSTech_Shenzhen were invited to come to Guangzhou to discuss with us. We exchanged opinions on  each project. During the discussion, the team of the SUSTech raised potential problems that our project may encounter in the future, as well as areas that need to be improved, such as how to remove the resistance of the plasmid after genetic transformation.</LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="DBoard" id="article0"><H2>

When we were facing the difficulties of extracting the genome DNA of Gluconacetobacter xylinus ATCC 23767, SCUT-China_A helped us to improve our method and finally we succeeded. On the other hand, we also measured the yeast growth variations and activity for SCUT-China_A. The help and contributions from and to other iGEM teams are extremely helpful for us to realize the importance of communication and collaboration.</LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="DBoard" id="article0"><H2>

NEU_China_B: How do you ensure that the integrative vector in transformants will not lose?
SCAU-China: The integrative vector we used is pFQ20 provided by the Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The homology arms in integrative vector for homologous recombination allows the target genes to be stably transferred into the genome of Microcoleus vaginatus. It has been verified through our experiment results.</LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="DBoard" id="article2" style="height:600px;"><P>SCAU-China: How to match the concentration of AI-2 expressed by the first plasmid pCFDuet-1 with the GFP concentration expressed by pet28a.</P><P>NEU_China_B: Our experiment was to release the AI-2 signal molecule after the PCFDUET-1 expression plasmid induction of lactic acid concentration, and AI-2 signal molecule can inhibit the lldr sequence on the second plasmid pet28a.</P><P>The LLDR sequence is capable of producing GFP-deterring proteins. In the experiment, we verified that two plasmid copies were more similar, and that the O1o2 sequence could be started normally when the lactic acid concentration was lower (less than 1m mol), and then the GFP gene could be produced fluorescent signal.</P><P> Therefore, the expression of two plasmids is more matched, and the experimental results are not affected in this project.</P><P>
What’s more, we provided the yogurt produced by Guangdong SCAU Assets Management Co.Ltd. to NEU_China_B as their experiment materials for the LED project. They finally obtained positive results by using the experimental materials from us.
