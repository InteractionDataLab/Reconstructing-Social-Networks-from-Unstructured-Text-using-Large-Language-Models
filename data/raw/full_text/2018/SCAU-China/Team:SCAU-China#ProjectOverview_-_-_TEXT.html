Project Overview
Background
There are many reasons for land desertification, and one of the most important factors is water. By increasing the moisture content of the soil, it will contribute to the growth of the plant and thus slow down the desertification process. Because cellulose has a lot of hydroxyl groups and can bind to a lot of water molecules, our project is to improve soil moisture retention by using cellulose produced in genetically modified organisms.

Design
There are many different types and structures of cellulose. After comparing and searching the data, we decided to use bacterial cellulose (from Acetobacter xylinum) as the target product. The bacterial cellulose synthesis-related gene bcs operon has a fairly high diversity. After analysis, we selected the seven most suitable genesï¼š bcsA,bcsB,bcsC,bcsD,bcsZ,bglX and bcsH. The chassis organism we chose was Microcoleus vaginatus. So we modified a homologous recombination kit to transfer BC genes of interest into Microcoleus vaginatus by homologous recombination.At the same time, the homologous recombination Kit can also be used to convert a variety of different cyanobacteria. For the convenience of later modeling, we used this kit to simultaneously transform the model organism ( Synechocystis sp. PCC6803).

Result
We successfully obtained two transformed individuals of cyanobacteria and tested them for cellulose content. But we have a problem: the cellulose content has increased to 180%, but the growth rate has been suppressed. We have designed two different scenarios for this in two different ways:
1.in vivo ( Mathematical Model of Biological Intrinsic Regulation System )
2.in vitro ( Method for Optimizing Microbial Cell Culture ).
For the Mathematical Model of Biological Intrinsic Regulation System, we also designed a type-II CRISPR/Cas9 kit. >>>>>>READ MORE ABOUT RESULT OR MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF BIOLOGICAL INTRINSIC REGULATION SYSTEM OR METHOD FOR OPTIMIZING MICROBIAL CELL CULTURE OR TYPE-II CRISPR/CAS9 KIT . )
