Here, we'd like to state our work and thank all who have helped us over the iGEM season.
Team Members
Our project is a team-work involving in 10 undergraduates that are divided into 6 groups. Each group was responsible for one aspect such as WIKI construction, art design, wet-lab work, human practices and so on. Here below, we state their individual contributions in case of further information are desired by iGEMers.
Team set-up and management
Weiteng Xu: He sets up the SCAU-iGEM 2018 team and served as the captain, not only for wet experiment, but also for our iGEM project.
Yinpin Huang: She is responsible for financial affairs.
Jiahua Zou (Kawah): She is responsible for announcement of updated messages.
Wet-lab work
Weiteng Xu: He is responsible for extracting genome DNA, constructing vectors and performing parts-related experiments.
Yinpin Huang: She is primarily responsible for vector construction (including cas9 vector construction and Acetobacter cellulase synthase expression vector reconstruction) and cyanobacterial transformation.
Yingli Li (Lily): Lily also was responsible for the work about lab safety.
Wei Wang: He is mainly in charge of the cultivation of cyanobacteria, cyanobacterial transformation and identification of bacterial cellulose. In addition, he also participates in  a series of wet-lab tasks incluing designing cesA knockout experiments and testing cyanobacterial growth conditions.
Yaohua Huang: He is primarily responsible for the cultivation of cyanobacteria and some other experiments related to cyanobacteria growth.
Xinyu Zhang: She is responsible for some of the experiments in interlab and making the Ubi-H-rrnB plasmid.
Art Design
Jiahua Zou (Kawah): She was the designer of our team, have designed the logo, team flag, team uniform, poster, banner and other promotional items for the team.
Xinyu Zhang:She participates in news reports and the designing of the team uniform.
Wiki
Jiadong Li/Xinling Huang: They work together to accomplish the design and construction of the WiKi contents.
Human Practices
Yinpin Huang: She is responsible for planning and organizing the human practices works (social activities, education and entrepreneurships).
Modeling
Weixu Wang (Ken): He is in charge of for the mathematical modeling of our project and has made significant contributions by providing new suggestions and ideas to improve our project.
Other Undergraduates
Yue Pan:As a former member of the team, she helped us complete some wet-lab experiments.
Supervisors/Advisor
Dr HAO WANG: Our mentor, Professor Wang gave us advices and suggestions, and our team members often discuss with him, search for his help at anytime when we met some difficulties to ensure the smooth running of our project.
iGEM Counselor Committee of SCAU: Professors Yaoguang Liu, Yiqun Deng, Gang Hao, Haihong Wang, Jikai Wen, Guohui Zhu and Dongmei He, all of them were responsible and selfless to help us to make iGEM possible.
The training ofhands-on experimental techniques and the knowledge of synthetic biology for the iGEM team weredone by Jicai Yi, Junhao Lu and Xuecheng Li.
Zihao Huang, Mengxi Zhu: They helped us to check up our wiki pages.
