2. Basic parts and Composite Part
(1) BBa_K515107
We characterized the BBa_K515107 part comprising the coding sequence BBa_K515007 which coded for Dendra2, a photoconvertible reporter protein under the control of the repressible promoter TetR (BBa_R0040) and the RBS (BBa_B0034).
(2) BBa_K2559000/ BBa_K2559001/ BBa_K2559002
This three parts were obtained from the Acetobacter Xylinum bacterial cellulose synthase, as they were suspected to function together to regulate the expression and secretion of bacterial cellulose.
This bcs Z(BBa_K2559000) is coding an endoglucanase in the process of cellulose hydrolysis, bcs H (BBa_K2559001) can express cellulose complement protein A which affects the expression levels of bcsB and bcsC, interacts with bcsD. bglX (BBa_K2559003) is a β-glucosidase.
(3) BBa_K2559003/ BBa_K2559004/ BBa_K2559011
This three parts BBa_K2559000, BBa_K2559001 and BBa_K2559002 were obtained from E. coli, and but the promoters (PrplJ, PdapA, PcaiF) are totally different in expressional intensity.
(4) BBa_K2559007/ BBa_K2559008/ BBa_K2559012/ BBa_K2559013
This four parts BBa_K2559007, BBa_K2559008, BBa_K2559012 and BBa_K2559013 were used for the construction of our synergistic recombination and CRISPR/cas9 kit
