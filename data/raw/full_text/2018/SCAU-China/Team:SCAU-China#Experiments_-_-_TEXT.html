Acetobacter xylinus.Protocols
Acetobacter xylinus. culturing media and culturing
Materials：
For 500ml media:
10g glucose (2%w/v)
2.5g yeast extract (0.5% w/v)
2.5g peptone (0.5% w/v)
1.35g Na2HPO4 (0.27% w/v)
0.75g citric acid (0.15% w/v)
500ml distilled H20
7.5g of agar if making agar plates
Add 250ml dH20 to glucose in one bottle and 250ml dH20 to the rest in a second bottle. In incompletely distilled water, glucose will form a solid mass, so stir vigorously immediately after adding water. Autoclave both bottles to sterilize media and pour glucose solution in sterile conditions (next to a Bunsen burner or in a flow hood) into the second bottle. Autoclaving glucose separately from amino acids avoids Maillard reaction, which can result in the formation of toxic byproducts in the media.
Streak/inoculate Acetobacter xylinus. to plates or into media.
Incubate plates at 30°C inverted. Colonies will appear in 48-72 hours.
Incubate liquid cultures at 30 °C standing. For quick growth, grow with shaking at 180rpm.

E. coli Protocols
Molecular cloning workflow
1. PCR was often used to generate the insert fragments, for example to add eGFP fragment to pSB1C3 plasmid, or to clone out a desired coding sequence for a new biobrick. In each case primers were designed with overhangs containing the desired prefix and suffix sequences. PCR reactions were set up using KOD plus or Q5 (NEB) polymerases. PCR programs varied but typically used a   protocol which improves accuracy of primer binding at the beginning of the reaction due to the higher temperatures. Ran ~10% of the PCR product on agarose gel to confirm it's success, then replicates were pooled and PCR purified (Axygen kit)
2. Insert fragment and vector’s backbone DNA were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes
3. Products were Gel-extracted or PCR purified
4. Vector backbone may be de-phosphorylated to prevent background re-ligation, setting up reaction as per manufacturers recommendation, then heat-kill the enzyme Optional: PCR purify to remove enzyme and buffer
5. Ligation reactions for the desired combinations of insert and backbone were set up, including negative control reactions which contain no insert DNA.
6. Transformed with ~2-4 ul ligation reaction into  DH5-alpha cells using the general heat shock protocol as explained previously
7. Picked colonies and inoculated mini-prep cultures, instead of picking cultures for mini-prepping, colony PCR was used when large numbers of colonies needed to be screened. And we used the forward primer binding at the backbone and reverse primer binding at inserting DNA to run PCR program and confirm it's success. Then only the positive clones were mini-prepped.
8. Positive clones were sent for sequencing of the insert using appropriate primers. Add DNA to 50 ul cells on ice (no more than 5 ul, i.e. no more than 10% volume of cells)
