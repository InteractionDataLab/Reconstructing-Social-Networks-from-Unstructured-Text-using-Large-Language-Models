Overview
We have cooperated with Anhui University of Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, and Ocean University of China.
Human Practices - Collabortion
Collaboration with AHUT-China
This year, our iGEM team developed cooperative relationship with the AHUT-China team, the iGEM team from Anhui University of Technology. We have reached an agreement to help each other check the model.
We first checked the feasibility of the models and analyzed their feasibility. Then, we improved these models. The AHUT-China team helped us test our translation software to identify any bug and provided us helpful suggestions. See more details (AHUT-China) .
Collaboration with UESTC-China
Our iGEM team also developed cooperation with the UESTC-China team, the iGEM team from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. We have reached an agreement of helping examine the effectiveness of DNA carriers.
First, we cloned EGFP cDNA from pEGFPN2 vector using primers containing NheI and BamHI. Second, we used EcoRI and NheI to cut pesc-trp plasmid, and then inserted the EGFP coding region and the FUS1 promoter into pesc-trp plasmid to construct pFUS1-EGFP carrier. UESTC-China used EcoRI and NheI to digest the pFUS1-EGFP carrier, and helped us to verify the DNA sequence of this plasmid. And we also help them verify the validity of the plasmid containing GroES gene. We digested the plasmid with BamH I-Vsp I and Bcu I-Vsp I to verify the validity of the plasmid. After digestion, the results they wanted to see were obtained, demonstrating that the plasmid was constructed correctly. See more details (UESTC-China) .
Collaboration with OUC-China
This year, our iGEM team also cooperated with the OUC-China team, the iGEM team from Ocean University of China. We had extensive interaction to let more people know the principal concepts of our cases.
When communicating with students from elementary schools, we publicized the case of the OUC-China iGEM Team, and distribute their well-decorated brochures to arouse the learning interest of the students. The students have became more familiar to the synthetic biology. They also gained extensive knowledge about the background and ultimate goal of the iGEM. See more details (OUC-China) .
