Quantitative verification of lock and key interaction
Plasmid pCYC-stem loop-Gluc was transformed into yeast. Meanwhile, plasmids with Gluc fragments and plasmids with keys were also transformed into the same yeast. Then, we measured Gluc expression using the GloMax 20/20 Luminometer to evaluate whether a lock and its corresponding key have functional interaction. In another word, we wanted to determine whether the key could specifically resolve the stem loop structure of a lock to enhance Gluc expression. Our data is presented in Figure 4, showing that the key and the lock indeed interacted.

		In order to verify whether α factor induces the expression of the Fig2C promoter, we transferred the constructed plasmids into yeast, and induced them with α factor. We observed the fluorescence in the transformed yeast cells under a fluorescence microscope (Figure 6). In addition, we also did quantitative PCR for EGFP mRNA. The results showed that EGFP expression significantly increased at 12 h (Figure 7), compared with the control group. These results showed that α factor can induce expression of the Fig2C promoter.

			We transferred the constructed plasmid pFig2C-EGFP into yeast, we call it “Spy Yeast”, and induced them with α factor.

		Although the stem loop can work as a “lock” to protect our ciphertext from being stolen, information burglar also can decode it by sequencing DNA directly. To overcome this situation, we were inspired by RNA splicing, a critical mechanism by which to modify transcriptome, it also can be used to realize the “misleading” part of the project. In our case, specific sequences contain misleading words are inserted into the information sequence we just designed by the code book as intron. Therefore, only after receivers tranform the “key plasmid” can cryptographic information be transcripted and spliced normally, and can the receiver get the correct information. As for information burglar, he will make a normal DNA sequncing only to obtain a misleading information with wrong meaning. Therefore, pre-mRNA splicing become a new method protecting our ciphertext from being decoded.<STRONG>Information expression verification</STRONG><STRONG>Yeast:</STRONG> a-type yeast.<STRONG>Function:</STRONG> Using the specific “key-lock” interaction, information can be obtained when expressing a specific key.<STRONG>Vector construction:</STRONG>
		Gene fragments of information with a stem loop and Ura screening genes were inserted between the two homologous arms, HA1 and HA2 to construct the pCYC-stem loop-information-Ura plasmid. HA1 and HA2 act as homology arms to promote the homologous recombination, which allows the integration of the DNA containing the stem loop lock sequence into the yeast genome. And the constructed plasmid is shown in Figure 1.</P><DIV align="center"><SPAN style="

				Verification of homologous recombination

In order to ensure that the information fragments were successfully integrated into the yeast genome, we picked the monoclonal culture and extracted the DNA for PCR verification.

At first we decided to use false information as an intron. In this way, though the thief gets the information sequence from the yeasts, he would get sentences with completely different meanings. And only the mature RNAs that has been spliced will carry the correct information. Therefore, the only way that we could get the correct meaning of the information is to reserve transcript the mature RNAs after getting it. But we didn't have much time to try out whether the introns we designed could be spliced, so we chose to use the natural introns in yeast. Unfortunately, our final result showed that the splice did not happen, either. So this is also the direction of our team's future efforts.
