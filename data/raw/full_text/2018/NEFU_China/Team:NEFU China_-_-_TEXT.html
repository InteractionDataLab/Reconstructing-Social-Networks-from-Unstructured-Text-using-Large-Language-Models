Welcome to NEFU_China
Every letter has its own frequency in English words, so does each codon in organisms. Therefore, we created a coding list, in which each letter corresponds to several codons with the same frequencies. In addition, we composed a program that can easily convert sentences into DNA sequences. Through this module, we achieved the transformation from English words to oligonucleotide sequences.

By inserting introns into the message-carrying DNA sequences, we changed the contents of the information. If the stealers are trying to extract the information by DNA sequencing directly, only wrong message can be read out.

The main part of the locking module is a DNA fragment with a stem loop structure generated by introducing the stem loop DNA upstream of the message-carrying DNA sequence. The stem loop structure blocked the movement of RNA polymerase, which caused transcription abortion. In this way, we prohibited the unwanted expression of the message.

As we know, any puzzle will be solved eventually as long as the attempting time is long enough. With the time going by, all of our barriers could be eventually defeated. Therefore, we added the module of yeast spores with a self-destruction system to limit the time of reading out the information by the suicide of yeast spores.
