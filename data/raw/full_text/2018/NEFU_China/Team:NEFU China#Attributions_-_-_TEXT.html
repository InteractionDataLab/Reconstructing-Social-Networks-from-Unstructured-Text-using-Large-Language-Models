BRONZE
1.The Team NEFU_China has registered the 2018 iGEM with great enthusiasm.
2.We have created a wiki webpage of our team with clear attribution of each aspect of our project. 
3.We have successfully added new and high quality experimental characterization data to an existing BioBrick BBA_K1829002.

SLIVER
1.We have created BBa_K2542000, BBa_K2542007 and BBa_K2542008 that work well in our project. These BioBricks have been documented in the Registry entry.
2.We have helped the UESTC-China team to examine their BioBricks. For more details, see our Collaboration part.
3.We propagated our project to the public, especially to the students, to enhance their awareness of our own information security in the human practices. We have attached a summary of the public perceptions of the importance of information security. Please check the human practice page in our wiki.

GOLD
1.We expanded our human practices by performing a questionnaire  on information security and presenting the concepts of our project in several elementary schools in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province. We also collected advice on how to protect our information assets.
2.We have successfully improved the performance of existing BioBricks BBa_K775004 to adapt our system. We have successfully created BBa_K2542014.
3.We first established a competitive model of two yeasts under the competitive relationship conditions in the medium. After a period of time, yeast alpha secreted factors, breaking the competitive relationship . We can compare factor α to a gun, killing type a yeast, thus establishing a gun battle model.
