Overview
On September 28, 2018, we came to the Gongnongbing primary school which was located in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province. The purpose of this meeting was to popularize the knowledge of synthetic biology and introduce our case to pupils in grade four. Leading teacher - Mr. Zeng, the keynote speaker - captain Pan, and five other members went together. The OUC-China had provided us with a beautiful brochure for this presentation.
First, we briefly explained the structure and application of each part of Escherichia coli (E. coli). What's more, we further encouraged children to think about how to reconstruct E. coli. Engineering bacteria were vividly likened to the 'ship' with different functions - 'E. coli ship'. And the 'blueprint' of 'E. coli ship', which called plasmid, determined its function. In the form of comics, we showed the process of duplication, transcription and translation in E. coli, making it easier for schoolchildren to understand what happened in the 'E. coli ship'.
Secondly, we introduced several famous 'E. coli ship' in the world.  Then, the concept of synthetic biology was introduced in simple language, so that pupils can be aware of the role of engineering bacteria directly.
Besides, we also designed interactive sessions for children, such as drawing their own imaginary 'E. coli ship'.
Last but not least, we introduced our case -- 'secured message transmission by yeast', and demonstrated our program on the spot, which enabled English and the 'language of yeast' to mutual transformation. Accompanied by a warm atmosphere, pupils enthusiastically participated in the interactive session.
In this presentation, we not only publicized our case, but also spread the concept of synthetic biology. With our careful explanation and vivid demonstration, the students in the audience understood the basic knowledge of synthetic biology, and became interested in it, which is conducive to the development of iGEM and synthetic biology.
