SILVER MEDAL CRITERIA
Brief
In our case, we used biological knowledge to build an encryption system with strong confidentiality. we also take into account the public response to our case, so take measures to let the public really accept our case. In order to ensure that our system is in line with the actual application, we interviewed the experts of the National Secrecy Bureau of Heilongjiang Province in China and conducted a questionnaire survey on potential users. In addition, in order to let the public truly accept our system, we made a mini game.

GOLD MEDAL CRITERIA
Brief
By communicating with professor Yuhua Li, we chose α-type yeast. α-type yeast can naturally produce α-factor, which can be recognized by a-type yeast to induce the pFig2c promoter. Besides, professor Chunbo Teng suggested that we can use introns that can be spliced out during mRNA maturation to further encrypt our information. Through communication with experts in the National Secrecy Bureau, we learned that if our system can be used in the encryption industry, we must limit the equipment and personnel access scopes to ensure that the entire encryption process is rigorous enough. Also through the players' self-report, we used computer programming to improve our password book to achieve the effect of word segmentation.
