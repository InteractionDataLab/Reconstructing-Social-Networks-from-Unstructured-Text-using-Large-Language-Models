2018.04.27
Come up with ideas about multi-level bio-encryption systems and search for information to improve scheme design.
2018.05.09
Design a synthetic coding sequence for the stem-loop structure as the lock part of our scheme.
2018.05.12
Design synthetic coding sequence of antisense RNA which can be matched to our designed stem-loop.
2018.05.28
Intercepting the homologous arm sequence from the transposons of the yeast that can integrate the encrypted information into the yeast and synthesizing it.
2018.08.24
Convert our encrypted information to the corresponding DNA sequence according to our encryption principle, and design its primers.
2018.09.15
Verify the expression of the downstream gene of the Fig2C promoter induced by the α factor.
 
2018.09.20
Verify the functionality of the stem loop as the lock part of our scheme.
 
2018.09.25
Interaction between the lock and the key, the correct information can be expressed after adding the key.
 
2018.09.30
Verify the expression level of the improved part pFUS1.
 
2018.10.10
The promoter function in the information destruction system is confirmed.
 
2018.10.15
Verify that the correct information can be expressed after adding the key.
 
2018.10.17
Finish the wiki.
