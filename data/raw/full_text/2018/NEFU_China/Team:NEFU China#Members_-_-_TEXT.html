Jiasong Pan
Contribution: As the student leader, his major tasks include dispatching assignments to team members and making valuable recommendations based on the case. His rich experience and active mind can inspire other members' initiative and creativity.
Xiaolei Wu
Contribution: Xiaolei Wu has participated in iGEM for the second time. As the leader of the group, he was responsible for training new team members in the early stage and guiding the experiment in the late.
Xingyang Liu
Contribution: It is the second time that Xingyang Liu takes part in iGEM. As an old member of the team, she is definitely right about the details of the experiments and she is responsible for the assistance of the wet laboratory.
Zihao Li
Contribution: He is a 2017 iGEMer from NEFU-China. As the old member of the team, he has a lot of experience and often gives new members advice. He can blend in with the new members and make good friends with them.
Yuhan Wang
Contribution: Yuhan Wang is participated in the experimental part of this year. And the meantime, she also works in the Plant Development Laboratory, using the genus Chrysanthemum for plant cold resistance research. When she is not in the lab, she likes to exercise, listen to music, and watch movies.
Yaoqiang Zheng
Contribution: Yaoqiang Zheng, mainly responsible for the construction of the key carrier and the verification of the yeast suicide system.If you’re looking for someone to help you with your problems, he is a reliable person.
Xinyi Gao
Contribution: If you see a girl who is dignified and graceful when you go into the lab, it must be Xinyi Gao. She is used to doing experiments in the daytime so she always gets up early. It was inevitable that the some experiments would fail, although she tried hard to do the experiment during the daytime. However, it doesn't make her negative, because she is an easy-going girl, and always throws her cares to the winds.
Liangliang Lu
Contribution: Liangliang Lu bury himself in biological research and is currently enrolled in undergraduate’s studies in Developmental Biology and is a lab member. He is assisting in wet lab and helping figure out problems in the case.
Yuehan Zhang
Contribution: Yuehan Zhang is the only team member who is major in Chemistry. She is assisting in wet lab and helping design the wiki for the team this year. As a quiet girl, both of reading books and playing guzheng are her favorite things.
Xudong Li
Contribution: Xudong Li is an accommodating person. As a member of the modeling group, it is responsible for the establishment of biological models and the realization of programs. Her main task is to design models and computer programs.
Siqi Liu
Contribution: Shiqi Liu is a backstage staff of the team. He usually gives many helps in this case, and his optimism influences our team. He has participated in the iGEM last year. Hes amenable for helping members to finish the experiments.
Lulu Zhu
Contribution: Lulu Zhu always tries her best to do everything. She had a good grasp of the basic experiment, so all of us trust her very much. During leisure time, she likes listening to music and reading books.
Yunxiao Lu
Contribution: Yunxiao Lu is a very reasonable and very clever good girl. She assisted in the experiments and participated in the design of our wiki. Although she have other experiments in microbiological laboratory, her assignments are never delayed. Finally, it must be emphasized that she is the loveliest girl that we have ever known.
Zhehao Du
Contribution: Zhehao Du actively participates in the design of case and offers lots of funny suggestions which benefits the development of our experiment. He has an intelligent mind and excellent experimental skills. He loves experimenting and always understands companions’ ideas at the first time.
Zicen Zhao
Contribution: Zicen Zhao is an energetic junior student . She likes trying everthing new. At present, she mainly studies the project of testing association between phenotypes and genetic variants. In igem, she mainly organizes the modeling group to hold meetings and is responsible for building most of models. In the spare time, she loves travelling and tastes different kinds of coffee.
Weiye Song
Contribution: Weiye Song is responsible for team culture in the team. She can always see her experimenting with big gloves. In her spare time, she likes music, painting, photography, collecting pens& inks, likes Chinese literature, occasionally writing poetry, and loving all beautiful things.
Bo Wang
Contribution: With great enthusiasm, Bo Wang, a junior majored in Biotechnology, participated the iGEM this year. The purpose of this decision was to turn big dreams into reality, to reinforce what he has learned in the Wet lab and to make efforts to the extension of synthetic biology knowledge. Outside the lab, he is always hiding his light under a bushel. Drawing, racing games, movies, singing... nothing can stagger his resolution to explore the world. The ability to transfer between subjects contribute to his eminent problem-solving skills. Hope fate will not intervene, so no one will give a sketch of his true potential.
Yibin Zhang
Contribution: Yibin Zhang is responsible for keeping everyone happy and adjusting public relations in the team.He introduced himself like this: ‘I like the feeling of going out of the lab under the stars and my friends.

In addition, I always shoulder the most important and arduous task of the team, that is, what to eat at noon.’
Tie Li
Contribution: Tie Li is a junior undergraduate whose major is biotechnology. He assists doing the wet experiment in the team and editing a part of content in the wiki. He likes jogging, painting and playing badminton during free time!
Yuxiao Zhang
