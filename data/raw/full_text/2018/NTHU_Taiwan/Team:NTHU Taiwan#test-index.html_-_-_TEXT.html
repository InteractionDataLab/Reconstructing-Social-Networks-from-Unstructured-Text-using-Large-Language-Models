Our project this year
The Vibrio-related infection leads to inestimable financial damage         in Taiwan and Japan, thus, exerting huge impact on the global fishery market.          Traditionally, in order to solve the problem of Vibrio infection,          the fisherman add antibiotics into the fishpond directly.          But in this way, the abuse of antibiotics will lead to irreversible harm to the Mother Nature.         Our goal this year is to design a system which based on the model of succession.
