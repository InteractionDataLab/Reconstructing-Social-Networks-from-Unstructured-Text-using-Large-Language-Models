With the increase in grain production, the annual straw output is increased by 12 million tons. Less than one-third of the large amount of straw produced each year has been returned to the field, and the utilization rate of fertilizer is less than 20%, and straw that has been burned or discarded has reached more than 20%. As a renewable energy source, corn stalk is the fourth largest energy source next to oil, coal and gas. However, because of the stable structure of corn stalk and the high content of lignocellulose, it is difficult to use. In order to solve this problem, we proposed a method for degrading straw by combining xylanase and feruloyl esterase and converting it into butanol and hydrogen, which can realize the recycling of straw.</P><P>At present, the main degradation methods of corn stalk include: physical treatment, chemical treatment and biological treatment. The physical degradation method is to destroy lignocellulose by mechanical processing method, but the cost is high and it cannot be used in industrial production. The chemical method is to use chemical reagents to co-act with corn stover to degrade the hard-to-use material, but there is acid or the problem of alkali residue, which will cause environmental pollution. The method of biological treatment of corn stalks is mainly using one or several kinds of microorganisms together to improve the physicochemical properties of corn stalks , degrade wood fibers under the cooperation of various means such as biological enzymes and improve the nutritional composition of corn stalks essentially. At present, there are three kinds of biological systems for degrading corn stalks: fungi, bacteria, and actinomycetes. The main problems are strict growth conditions, slow growth rates, and limitations in practical applications.</P><P>In the United States, the whereabouts of straw mainly include four aspects: First, as coarse grains that cattle, sheep and other ruminants like. Second, compost in the fields. Third, when home accessories and building materials. Fourth, turn green fuel. However, the situation is more complicated in China due to the existence of double-cropping or triple-cropping systems, for which there is insufficient time for straw degradation, thus, straw will not be completely decomposed in the soil, which is not favorable for crop growth. At the University of Wisconsin, scientists from the University of Wisconsin already have chemical and biological engineering scientists. They are working on how to make bioethanol from microorganisms such as corn stalks at a lower cost. The conversion of straw to ethanol is the best way to utilize straw. Compared with ethanol, butanol has higher carbon content, higher energy content, better economy and less volatile, and has more advantages. As a result, we chose to convert straw directly into butanol.</P><P>Because the crop stalks are rich in energy, including solar energy converted by photosynthesis and the chemical energy of minerals in the soil that is absorbed by the self- growth. These energy can be used and converted, so straw can be made into fuel. It is a very important energy substance. In 2011, the percentages of CO2, NOx , and PM emitted from burning straw were 0.12, 0.73, and 2.16% of the total national emissions. In addition to environmental issues, burning straw also wastes a valuable biomass resource; the economic loss caused by burning straw in 2004 exceeded 19 billion RMB. It can be seen that because of the advances in crop planting technology, the amount of crop stalks produced each year has also been increasing rapidly. The rational use of straw has received global attention. Correct use of these waste resources not only reduces pollution but also has more economic benefits.</P></DIV><DIV id="Harm"><H2>Why are butanol and hydrogen produced at the same time</H2><P>In recent years, with the massive exploitation and utilization of oil resources, more and more carbon dioxide has been released into the atmosphere, which has caused global warming artificially. Therefore, there is an urgent need for alternative energy sources. In alternative fuels, butanol has a longer carbon chain, higher heat value and boiling point than ethanol. Moreover, the thermal value of butanol is very close to that of gasoline, higher than that of methanol and ethanol. So butanol is more fuel efficient. We know that pure hydrogen fuel is carbon-free and zero-emission. Therefore, if the engine is converted to hydrogen fuel, it will greatly expand the scope of lean mixed combustion of the engine, improve fuel economy and reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.</P><P>After analysis, butanol mixed hydrogen fuel has the following advantages:</P><P>1) The reaction of hydrogen combustion is a chain reaction mechanism, which means that the hydrogen fuel engine is closer to the ideal isothermal heat cycle. It can improve the efficiency of the engine. Therefore, butanol mixed with hydrogen can improve the efficiency of the mixed fuel. The flame propagation speed of hydrogen (2.91m/s) is 7.72 times that of gasoline. The faster the flame propagation speed, the faster the combustion speed of mixed fuel, and the smaller the circulation change.</P><P>2) The combustion limit of hydrogen is 4-75, so there is a wide range of air/fuel mixtures. The combustion limit of butanol is 1.45~11.25. Compared with butanol, hydrogen can be burned at a large air/fuel ratio, making it easy to achieve lean combustion in a hydrogen internal combustion engine. When butanol is mixed with hydrogen, the ratio of air/fuel mixture can be increased and the engine economy can be improved.</P><P>3) Although the spontaneous combustion temperature of hydrogen is higher than butanol, the requirements for ignition energy are lower, and the minimum value can be as low as 0.02mJ. Hydrogen fuel engines rarely catch fire, so they start easily. When butanol is mixed with hydrogen, the starting performance of the engine can be improved.</P><P>4) Hydrogen diffusion coefficient in air is greater than butanol, and hydrogen diffusion coefficient is 12 times of gasoline. Hydrogen is more likely to mix with air than butanol to form a uniform mixture. So when butanol is mixed with hydrogen, it's more likely to form a uniform mixture.</P><P>5) The chemical reaction of CO and HC in the cylinder is more efficient due to the large amount of activation generated by hydrogen combustion chain reaction. When butanol is mixed with hydrogen, CO and HC emissions can be reduced.A butanol-hydrogen economy overcomes the problems faced with ethanol and the other alternative fuels: 1) Butanol does not have to be stored in high-pressure vessels like natural gas. 2) Butanol can be transported through existing pipelines for distribution. The filling station of the future could service regular automobiles, hybrids, and fuel cell vehicles all at one stop, all with one renewable fuel made locally. 3) The application of fuel cell technology is held up by the safety issues associated with hydrogen distribution, since butanol is safe and can be very easily reformed, as is methanol and ethanol, for its hydrogen content butanol solves another problem. 4) Since butanol can be blended with gasoline or diesel (oxygenate), it can be slowly introduced into the fuel grid as more and more biorefineries are built throughout the ‘Bio-Belt’. 5) Jobs created in this burgeoning industry will stay in America and cannot be sent overseas – fuel generation will be a local activity. 6) Further, because butanol is very safe, it solves many of the inherent dangers with transporting fuels, natural gas and hydrogen. We see the different Btu values for ethanol, butanol and hydrogen per pound and gallon in Table 2. It is assumed that hydrogen is produced from the same bushel of corn that produced butanol and accounts for 0.6 pounds per bushel corn. Ethanol at 6.56 pounds per gallon yields 211 Kilo Btu’s per bushel while the butanol-hydrogen process yields 260 Kilo Btu’s with butanol at 6.76 pounds per gallon and another 38 Kilo Btu’s for hydrogen. Or almost 300 Kilo Btu’s more. That is 42 % more energy from the same bushel of corn when making butanol and hydrogen versus ethanol. In a 25,000,000 gallon per year butanol-hydrogen biorefinery capable of converting</P><P>butanol and hydrogen into electricity via fuel cells we might expect to see the following: 750 thousand megawatt-hours per year versus ethanol at 525. (see Table 3.) Butanol has a market value between $0.45 and $0.50 per pound that is around $3.38 per gallon. The open Commodity Market that exists today requires barge loads shipped to distributors. There are over 2 billion pounds of butanol sold each year for paint thinner, brake-fluid and perfumes. With this in mind we might see from Table 5 the following profit of about $47 million more than a similar ethanol facility.</P></DIV><DIV id="Technology"><H2>Part1 From straw to cellulose</H2><P>Feruloyl esterase is a subclass of carboxylesterase that hydrolyzes ferulic acid ester groups that participate in cross-linking in the complex structure of plant cell walls. Xylanase can hydrolyze plant cells from xylan, a component that cleaves the β-1,4 glycosidic bond between xylose residues in the xylan backbone.</P><P>Through various experiments, it has been proved that only a small amount of ferulic acid is released when a single feruloyl esterase acts on a substrate. However, when used together with xylanase, the release of ferulic acid will be significantly increased and lignin will be released from the biomass. When ferulic acid esterase and xylanase work together, there is a clear synergistic interaction between the two, which can significantly increase the activity of feruloyl esterase. So we are going to use these two enzymes together to decompose the straw and use the straw more efficiently.</P><P>We used the bifunctional xylanase-ferulic acid esterase (xyn10D-fae1A) in our experiments and the results of site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated the functional coupling of the two catalytic domains of Xyn10D-Fae1A. The gene encoding a dual-function enzyme comes from an anaerobic bacterium, Prevotella ruminicola 23, which is good at using non-cellulosic polysaccharides such as starch and xylan. In addition, the β-D-glucosidase encoded by the gene sequence xy13A obtained from this bacterial genome is active against pNP-β-D-xylopyranoside, pNP-β-L-arabinofuranoside and oligo-xylose. It can act synergistically with the bifunctional xylanase-feruloyl esterase to accelerate the release of xylose monomer from the xylan substrate.</P></DIV><DIV id="Strategy"><H2>Part2 From cellulose to G6P</H2><P>lar polysaccharide composed of glucose, which is the main component of plant cell wall, and also the most widely distributed and abundant polysaccharide in nature. The base ring of cellulose is a large molecule polysaccharide composed of d-glucose and iso-1 4 glycosidic bonds. Its chemical composition contains contains 44.44% carbon, 6.17% hydrogen, and 49.39% oxygen.</P><P>Cellulose is the floorboard of a group of enzymes that degrade cellulose to generate glucose. It is not a single enzyme, but a synergistic multicomponent enzyme system including exoglucanase, endoglucanase and glucosidase, as well as highly active xylanase.</P><P>Glycosidase is also called iso-d-glucosidase, which is an important component of cellulolytic enzyme system. Its main function is to hydrolyze the non-reductive glucosidic bonds that bind to the ends and release glucose as a product. In a nutshell, glucosidase hydrolyzes cellulosic disaccharides to produce two molecules of glucose.</P><P>The amorphous regions within the cellulose polysaccharide chain are randomly cut by endoglucanase to produce oligosaccharides of different lengths and new ends of chains.</P><P>Exoglucanase react on these reductive and non-reductive ends of the chain of cellulose polysaccharide, realizing glucose and cellulosic disaccharides.</P><P>In this case, we will focus on the choice of endoglucanase and exoglucanase because they play a vital role in hydrolysis of cellulose polysaccharide. So the translative quantity of enzymes and its catalytic activity will greatly affect the results that we finally desire. Therefore, we must choose these two enzymes carefully as possible, not necessarily the most active, but certainly more reliable. We finally found the research on Cellulomonas fimi is relatively mature after reading literatures and referring to previous IGEM projects. As mentioned above, we carefully selected Cellulomonas fimi’s endoglucanase gene and exoglucanase gene and transferred them to Escherichia coli for expressing the enzymes.</P><P>Additionally, compared with fungi’s cellulase gene, Cellulomonas fimi has its own advantages: Prokaryotes don’t distinguish between introns and exons. So it’s easy for Escherichia coli to transcribe and translate in similar prokaryotic cell environment. At the same time, because there is no eukaryotic protein reprocessing (golgi and endoplasmic omentum), the final structure of enzyme can be guaranteed.</P></DIV><DIV id="p31"><H2>Part3-1 From G6P to butanol</H2><P>There is a butanol synthesis pathway in native Clostridium, in order to meet the needs of industrial production, we hope to achieve continuous production of butanol in E.coli. Previous studies have shown that the construction of a clostridium difficile fermentation pathway for the production of 1-butanol in e. coli can achieve good results [1, 2, 3] with a yield of 0.2g /l /h.  Thus we modified the original acid synthesis pathway within E.coli -- the accumulation of NADH in bacteria was used as the driving force for 1-butanol production. Meanwhile, excessive expression of Fdh gene let more formate oxidized to carbon dioxide and NADH. In addition, according to the literature which studies the screening of same enzymes of different species, we finally tried to assemble a relatively superior combination [3], which mainly uses the following six genes to construct a biosynthetic pathway from glucose to butanol：</P><P class="mid">Graph 1：Synthetic 1-butanol pathway expressed in engineered E. coli. the gene are listed as follow: Fdh, formate dehydrogenase; AtoB, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase;  Hbd, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase; Crt, crotonase; ter, trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase; AdhE2, aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase; groES &amp; groEL, heat shock protein.Different microbial sources of the 1-butanol pathway enzymes are shown in the parenthesis: EC, Escherichia coli; CA, Clostridium acetobutylicum; TD, Treponema denticola; CB, Candida boidinii</P><P>Meanwhile, we built a self-regulated 1-butanol production system in E.coli by using its endogenous fermentation regulatory element (FRE) to automatically drive the 1-butanol biosynthetic gene in response to its natural fermentation needs. There is a mixed acid fermentation pathway in wild-type E. coli , which will express and produce mixed acids such as succinic acid and lactic acid when the bacteria are deficient in oxygen. FRE is the transcriptional and translational regulatory element upstream of these mixed acid fermentation genes, including the promoter, ribosome binding site (RBS) and the entire transcription factor (TF) binding site. Wen et al. [4] have proved that using its original regulatory element of ackA and adhE (FREadhE, FREackA) has a good effect on butanol production, without adding revulsant, antibiotics and under anaerobic fermentation conditions, and finally reaching 0.4 g/liter/h. Therefore, it is possible to stably and efficiently produce 1-butanol without using inducer or removing oxygen completely.</P><P>In addition, the accumulation of butanol exerts a great inhibitory effect on cell growth during the production process, which will result in reducing of cell viability and limited butanol yield.</P><P>Thus, we also import GroESL gene from Clostridium acetobutylicum to allow E.coli express the heat shock protein groESL chaperone, which plays an important role in the folding and transport of proteins and the repair of misfolded proteins[5]. It will also increase the protein folding rate and improve the tolerance of E. coli to butanol [6].</P></DIV><DIV id="p32"><H2>Part3-2 From G6P to hydrogen</H2><P>In this project, we have carried out two major transformations of E. coli. First, exogenous introduction of the hydrogenase HYDa of Enterobacter cloacae; and secondly, overexpression of the activator gene fhla of the formate-hydrogen lyase system (FHL). We hope that through these two synthetic biology methods, the transformed E. coli will have the ability to synthesize hydrogen.</P>HYDa: Hydrogenase plays a major role in anaerobic fermentation of hydrogen production. Hydrogenase is a multi-enzyme complex composed mainly of iron-sulfur protein and catalyzes a simple chemical reaction: 2H++2e-→H2. Hydrogenases can be classified into three types depending on the difference in metal ions contained: hydrogenases containing Ni and Fe, hydrogenases containing Fe, and hydrogenases that do not contain metals. The vast majority of known hydrogenases belong to the first two, and metal-free hydrogenases are only found in methanogenic bacteria.<P>Ferrohydrogenase is present in green algae and bacteria, contains only one subunit, and has a unique non-mercapto H-cluster at the catalytic center, so it is 100 times more active than other hydrogenases. All the ferrohydrolase families share three highly conserved four cysteine regions in the active center. Mishra et al. performed a study on the molecular characteristics of the hydrogenase gene HYDa that was higher than the high H. pylori Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08. We chose this hydrogenase gene.</P><P>FhlA:FhlA is aflatoxin formic acid. The transcriptional activator of the hydrolase FHL system, encoding the terminal gene of the hyp operon, is contrary to the HycA effect of the first gene encoding the hyc operon.</P><P>Many studies have found that the overexpression of E. coli fhlA will increase the amount of hydrogen produced by the recombinant strain: in 2005, Yoshida et al. overexpressed fhlA to make E. The hydrogen production of recombinant strain coli W3110 was 1.7-fold higher than that of wild-type strain. The double-mutant strain that overexpressed fhlA and knocked out hycA increased the hydrogen production rate by 2.8-fold, and increased the formate dehydrogenase fdhF gene expression by 6.5. Times, the Hyc3 gene expression of Hydrogenase Hyd3 large subunit increased 7-fold.</P></DIV><DIV id="References"><H2>References</H2><OL><LI>还没加上</LI><LI>还没加上</LI></OL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
