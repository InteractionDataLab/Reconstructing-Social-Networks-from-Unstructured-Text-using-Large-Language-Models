I'm happy to be one of the iGEMers. Here I opened the door to the new world of synthetic biology. Thanks to this competition, I not only learned a lot of knowledge of synthetic biology, but also got to know a lot of like-minded friends. Although I was tired and tired every day for the further perfection of the project, I felt painful but happy. IGEM is not only a technology competition, but also a stage to show our wonderful ideas. This summer, a wonderful trip, for my future left a good memory!

Human practice is a fantastic thing that I have been experiencing this summer. I come across a great many people with the same interest in this area and enjoy every single day in lab with my teammates. For me, iGEM is a great chance to go beyond myself while making more contributions to our project and the world.

As an iGEMer, I enjoy the days in our lab. Synthetic biology can transform our fancy into actual perfect application. Our research could make contribution to society and improve our environmental quality. Besides, I believe that my Gene Rubik's Cube can arouse people’s interest to synthetic biology. For myself, I like photography and I am so happy my hobby can help my teammates.

iGEM is the first academic competetion which means a lot for me. During this summer, I stayed in lab with other 15 partners. In a sense, it is the first time to participate in  scientific research for us. Paid a lot, and harvest a lot.

It’s a long journey to participate in the iGEM match. There, we fight for a corporate destination together and treat ourselves when we’re free. During this period, we learnt much about synthetic biology and gradually knew how to care about our surrounding environment.

Liu Xieyi
As a student majoring in biomedical engineering, I am honored to be an iGEMer, joining into the UESTC-China to explore synthetic biology together with my teammates. During the process, I not only felt the charm of synthetic biology, but also gained precious friendship. As the principal art designer, I made great efforts to design creative elements in order to display our team’s progress. I am proud of being an iGEMer.

Becoming an iGEMer is an coincidence to me but it brings me one of the most fantastic experiences of my life. Though I have relevant experience, I have learned a lot from others. It is so wonderful to aim unsolved but amazing problems with my buddies. When I had dreamed of life as an biology researcher, I never realized the reality is more colorful than the fancy.The memory of the iGEM will be treasure of my life forever.

Ding Shizhi
I was an ordinary college students, love reading and writing. Although I am a girl, I like to admire the lovely and confident girl. Because I think I can learn a lot from these girls. I am confident that you will feel more comfortable with me. Joining iGEM enabled me to become a biological researcher briefly. Doing biology experiments gave me pleasure and satisfaction. I really appreciate my support from my teammates.

For me ,participating in iGEM is an amazing journey during my school life. It’s a big challenge for myself, but I got a fantastic experience. It’s also an opportunity to achieve our ideas to make the world better. Now we are trying to change the straw to clean energy by ourselves. It’s really unbelievable!We believe that IGEM brings us happiness and precious experience.

In addition, we study together, we work together, we play together, we fight for one goal in our team, which make my life interesting!

Wang Yansong
For me, iGEM is a magical competition. I hardly ever imagined that we could put microbes together so that they would work like a machine before we really got to know it. The experience of working with peers for iGEM is hard but fun, and it's fun to keep exploring the biology behind it. IGEM is a window, it brings me very limited things, but I see more through it.
