Gel Extraction of DNA(Omega Gel Extraction Kit)
Excise the agarose gel slice containing the DNA fragment of interest with a clean, sharp scalpel under ultraviolet illumination. Briefly place the excised gel slice on absorbent toweling to remove residual buffer. Transfer the gel slice to a piece or plastic wrap or a weighing boat. Mince the gel into small pieces and weigh. 100 mg of gel is equivalent to a 100 μl volume. Transfer the gel slice into a 1.5 ml microfuge tube.
Add a 3x sample volume of Buffer DE-A.
Resuspend the gel in Buffer DE-A by vortexing. Heat at 75°C until the gel is completely dissolved. Intermittent vortexing to accelerate gel solubilization.
Add 0.5x Buffer DE-A volume of Buffer DE-B, mix. If the DNA fragment is less than 400 bp, supplement further with a 1x sample volume of isopropanol.
Place a Miniprep column into a 2 ml microfuge tube. Transfer the solubilized agarosefrom Step 4 into the column. Centrifuge at 12,000xg for 1 minute.

Analysis
 1.SDS-PAGE
Make the separating gel
Set the casting frames on the casting stands.
Prepare the gel solution(as described above) in a separate small beaker.
Swirl the solution gentlybut thoroughly.Pipet appropriate amount of separatinggel solution (listed above) into the gap between the glass plates.
To make the top of the separating gel behorizontal, fill in isopropanol into the gap until overflowing.
Wait for 1h to let itgelate.
 
Make the stacking gel
Discard the isopropanol and you can see separating gel left.
Pipet in stacking gel untill a overflow.
Insert the well-forming comb without trapping air under the teeth. Wait for 40min to let it gelate.
 
Take the galss plates in the electrophoresis bath
Make sure a complete gelation of the stacking gel and take out the comb.
Take the glass plates out of the casting frame and set them in the cell buffer dam.
Pour the running buffer (electrophoresis buffer) into the inner chamber and keep pouring
after overflow untill the buffer surface reaches the required level in the outer chamber.
 
Prepare the samples
Mix your samples with 5X lodaing buffer.(160L sample + 40L loading buffer).
Heat them in boiling water for 5 min.
 
Sample loading
Load protein marker in to the first lane.
Load prepared samples into wells and make sure not to overflow.
Then cover the top and connect the anodes.
 
Run
Set 80V before the downmost sign of protein marker reach the separating gel, it takes about 0.5h.
Change the volt to 120V when the downmost sign of protein marker reach the separating gel, It takes about 0.5h.
 
Dying and bleaching
You can stop running when the downmost sign of the protein marker almost reaches the foot line of the glass plate.
Take out the separating gel carefully, and dye in the coomassie brilliant blue solution(as described above) for 6h.
Take out the separating gel and rinse it twice by UP water.
Bleach it by destaining solution for 1.5h.
2. Enzyme activity detection
Congo red assay
Luria agar plates with 0.2% CMC are inoculated with the strain and incubated at 37°C for 24h. Next day the agar is flooded with 1 mg/ml Congo Red solution for 1h. Congo Red solution is poured off into a toxic waste bottle and 1 M NaCl is added and left for another 1 h.Then pour off NaCl solution.
3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method
Reactions are carried out in 50 ml centrifuge tubes with substrate in the buffer, plus enzyme solution. Reaction mixtures are incubated at 40 °C for 3 h, enzyme action is interrupted by the addition of 3,5-dinitrosalisylic acid (DNS) reagent, which is used to quantify the total amount of reducing sugars. Reaction mixtures are then placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, cooled to room temperature and diluted to 25 ml with water for the measurement of absorbance at 540 nm with a spectrophotometer.
