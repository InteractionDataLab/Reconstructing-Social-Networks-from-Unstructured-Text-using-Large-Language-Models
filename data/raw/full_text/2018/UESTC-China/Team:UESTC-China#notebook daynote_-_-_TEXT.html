In March
The school competition of iGEM in University of Electronic Science and Technology of China was held. After series of individual races and team competitions, excellent people were finally chosen into iGEM team of 2018: UESTC-China. Then we started to demonstrate the feasibility of our project in school competition and searched for some useful and interesting projects.
In April
Through many active discussions and literature review, we decide to degrade the straw. We divided all the members into two groups to explore more useful information. We all actively seek out relevant literatures about metabolic pathways and involved gene to make the ideas more clear.
In May
After four sessions of the group discussion and papers reading, we decided to choose straw degradation as our project. Then we started to carry out primary design of the project and then synthesized some key gene.
In June
We are constantly optimizing our project and verifying the feasibility of the project.
In July
Follow the primary design, we mainly did Molecular cloning experiments this month.
7.16
According to the requirements of InterLab，We had transformed E.coli  DH5α with these following plasmids :BBa_R0040 、BBa_I20270 、BBa_J364000 、BBa_J364001 、BBa_J364002、BBa_J364007、BBa_J364008、BBa_J3640009.
7.17
1. We pick 2 colonies from each of the transformation plates and inoculate in 10 mL LB medium + Chloramphenicol. Grow the cells overnight at 37°C and 220 rpm.
2. We make three sets of unit calibration measurements: an OD600 reference point, a particle standard curve, and a fluorescein standard curve.
