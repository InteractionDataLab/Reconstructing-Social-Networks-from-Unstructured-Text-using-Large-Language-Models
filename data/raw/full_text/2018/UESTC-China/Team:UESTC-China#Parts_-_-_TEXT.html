Parts contribution
This year, we conducted a series of experiment for the two basic parts, BBa_K118022 and BBa_K118023. We validated that BBa_K118022 and BBa_K118023 can work successfully in E. coli. In addition, we used filter paper assay, CMC enzyme activity assay and Congo Red assay for the two enzymes activities.
