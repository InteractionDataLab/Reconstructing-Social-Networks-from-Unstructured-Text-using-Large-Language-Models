Integration in our project
 "Gene go!"
"Gene go!" was held in Sichuan Science  and Technology Museum on June 17 by UESTC-China and UESTC-Software, which is an event of Education and Public  Engagement. We released information on the activities through the platform of SCSTM.  Within one day, we received registration forms from more than 300 families, reaching the maximum capacity  of the activity.
"Gene go!" including five section, such as DIY classroom, "Cellulose Go" Show, Exploring the micro  world etc. We created an atmosphere of synthetic biology, telling them what is  iGEM and what we're doing for the world.
"Gene go!" was appreciated by SCSTM and  a lot of parents, they both expected us to hold such a great event next year.
 DIY  Classroom
Making  a leaf vein bookmark
Based  on cellulose, which plays an important part in our project, we set up our first  course called"Making a leaf vein bookmark". Through the process of making vein  bookmarks, the children can easily recognize the toughness of the veins and  learn about cellulose which plays an important role in it
Making  cell model with plasticine
The  second course we set up called "Making cell model with plasticine". We  introduced the cell model to children simply and took them making cell model  with plasticine. Under our careful guidance, the children succeeded in making  beautiful cell models. After class, the children said they were happy could  learn the structure of cell today.
 
 Exploring  the micro world
After finishing the course of "Making cell model with  plasticine", we led the children to observe the  real cells with microscopes. We also offer different types of slices, taking  them to operate the microscope and introduce related knowledge to them.
 
 "Cellulose  Go" Stage Play
We have adapted our project  "Straw-Degrading Energy E.coli" into a stage play called "Cellulose Go" to explain  our project. In the play, our protagonist "Cellulose" is an adventurer who is  aiming at exploring ways to change herself into clean energy. But she was  prisoned by the big devil, lignin. At this time, 3 warrior from UESTC take their  plasmid sword to save the cellulose and help her change into clean energy.
It was a play that combined knowledge  and fun. The stage play was so interesting that the children all burst out  laughing. We also set some questions after our play to see whether children  have learned from it. We were impressed by a girl who not only gave us the  right answer of "Why butanol is harmful to bacterial" but also explained her  choice perfectly with the plot in our play.
 
 Gene Card
We  invited children to play gene card. Children had fun and learned synthetic  biology's basic process and tools in the game. Gene card successfully provoked  their interest to synthetic biology.
 
 Learning about iGEM
We  have designed several exhibition boards on iGEM and Synthetic Biology,  introducing what is iGEM and what we are doing for changing the world.
 
lab open day
We held a  lab open day which attracted students of Chengdu NO.7 middle school. We introduced iGEM to them  and showed them around our lab. At last we let them do some basic experiments  and they experienced the real life of lab.
