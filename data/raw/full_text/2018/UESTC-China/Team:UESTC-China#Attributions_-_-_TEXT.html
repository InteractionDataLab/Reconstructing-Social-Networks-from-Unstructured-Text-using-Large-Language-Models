 Team Leader
Jianzhe Yang and Changyu Li are our team leaders. As team leaders, they were responsible for the coordination of the team, and supervised experimental details to promote the experimental process. At the meantime, Jianzhe Yang contacted with biological companies to buy related reagents. The role Changyu Li played in the experiment was mainly to finish the construction and verification of vectors.
 Plasmids Construction, InterLab and Improve a Previous Part
Changyu Li, Huishuang Tan, Shizhi Ding, Yinsong Xu, Yansong Wang and Yetao Zou all contributed to plasmids construction. Additionally, Shizhi Ding and Yinsong Xu were both responsible for InterLab and making great effort in it. Additionally, Huishuang Tan and Jianzhe Yang constructed the improve part and detected it.
 Experiments in Straw Degradation
Shizhi Ding, Yinsong Xu and Yetao Zou were mainly responsible for experiments in straw degradation. They construct the plasmid of straw degradation, which is piGEM2018-Module001 and conduct it into different E. coli strains. For the final product in this step, they finish the detection of ferulic acid by gas chromatography as well as xylose and glucose qualitatively by TLCA.
 Experiments in Butanol Production
Changyu Li and Huishuang Tan were mainly responsible for experiments in butanol production. They construct the plasmid of butanol production, which is piGEM2018-Module002. Additionally, they measured the titer of butanol by gas chromatography. They also studied the improvement of the resistance of E. coli to butanol by GroESL.
 Assay of cellulase activity
Yetao Zou and Liang Zhao were mainly responsible for enzyme assay. They detected the activity and the extracellular expression of cellulase.
 Experiments in Hydrogen Production
Jiayi Yin and Yansong Wang were mainly responsible for experiments in hydrogen production. They construct the plasmid of hydrogen production, which is piGEM2018-Module003 and conduct it into different E. coli strains. In addition, they finish the detection of Hydrogen by gas chromatography and another team member, Qi Wang set up a hydrogen collection device.
 Human Practices
Yuxian Zhang, Longjing Pan, Jianzhe Yang were mainly responsible for human practices and Changyu Li, Yinsong Xu, Xiang Zhou and Qi Wang also make contribution to it. They had made the following contributions :
Support project：
Longjing Pan and Yuxian Zhang carried out a variety of questionnaires to survey the current situation of treating straw and citizen’s attitude toward clean energy. To make our project more practical, they interact with expert in Biogas Institute of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs to learn more information about agricultural waste and bioenergy. They also interviewed synthetic biology expert, Dr. Junbiao Dai to optimize our pathway.
Public Engagement：
Yuxian Zhang and Changyu Li organized a large event of Education of Public Engagement called “Gene go”, interacting with more than 300 families in Sichuan Science and Technology Museum. They are also making effort in high school students, inspiring their interest in synthetic biology. There are other team members designed some product such as “Gene Card” online programed by Xiang Zhou and Qi Wang, Crazy Lab designed by Yinsong Xu and Plasmid Rubik made by Longjing Pan. Collaboration and meet-up is in the charge of Yuxian Zhang and Jianzhe Yang to combine universities to solve the problems that was hardly solved by themselves.
 Model
Zijian Wu was mainly responsible for modeling. He helped the experimenters scientifically design the experiment and get the required data. He used the data to get the optimal conditions for the fermentation process. This is an effective optimization of our system. In order to further explore and optimize our system, he established models for butanol and hydrogen production systems, and found speed limiting steps and sensitive parameters.
 Artists
Xieyi Liu and Jiayi Yin were mainly responsible for art design. As art designers, they focused on cooperation and contacted with Human Practice, Wiki and experiment. Their work included our team logo, team uniform, the design of the page and illustrations of Wiki as well as the posters and PowerPoint required for meetings such as Southwest Alliance and CCiC. They also joined in the design of our educational product, such as “Crazy Lab” etc.
 Wiki Engineer
Qichen Pan was mainly responsible for the establishment of our Wiki page. During the whole project, he warmly cooperated with art designers and designed a set of Wiki style. He was in charge of coding and debugging. Meanwhile, he collected project content from other members and delivered it to the website and ensured complete display of Wiki.
 
Advisor
 Binglin Liu
He taught us how to design construction and primer for vector, and checked the sequence of primers whether it’s right or not. He also guided us to finish the construction of vector efficiently by teaching us how to make Gibson assembly.
 
PI
 Lixia Tang
She is one of our instructors. She gave us some guidance on modeling. She also gave us a hand on experiment of protein expression and detection of enzyme activity. In addition, she helped us to make the data analysis. Moreover, she came up with a series of valuable advices about the design of wiki and ppt.
 Yong Zhang
He is one of our instructors. He guided us to design the whole project and helped us to check construction strategy whether it’s feasible. Especially, he gave us very professional guidance on molecular cloning. He also helped us to comb the pathway and analyzed the result. What’s more, he gave some useful suggestions on wiki and presentation.
 Xuelian Zheng
She is one of our instructors. She gave us a lot of suggestions in details during the process of design and experiments. She helped our team leader to coordinate the team works and had communication with each member friendly to appease our tension. She also raised some idea about the style of our wiki, poster, banner and so on.
 Juan Feng
She is one of our instructors. She was concerned with our InterLab and gave us a lot of useful suggestions on it. Meanwhile, she gave us many theoretical guidance on modeling and taught us way of using various software to found model. She also gave us precious advices on TLC design.
