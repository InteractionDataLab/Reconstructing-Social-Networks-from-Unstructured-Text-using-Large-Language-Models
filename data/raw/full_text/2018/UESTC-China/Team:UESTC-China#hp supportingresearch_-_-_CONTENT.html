            &quot;Gene go!&quot;
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            “Gene go!” was held in Sichuan Science and Technology Museum(SCSTM) on June 17 by UESTC-China and UESTC-Software, which is an event of Education and Public Engagement. We released information on the activities through the platform of SCSTM. Within one day, we received registration forms from more than 300 families, reaching the maximum capacity of the activity.
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            “Gene go!” including five section, such as DIY classroom, “Cellulose Go” Show, Exploring the micro world etc. We created an atmosphere of synthetic biology, telling them what is iGEM and what we’re doing for the world.
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            “Gene go!” was appreciated by SCSTM and a lot of parents, they both expected us to hold such a great event next year.

            a)   Making a leaf vein bookmark
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            Based on cellulose, which plays an important part in our project, we set up our first course called “Making a leaf vein bookmark”. Through the process of making vein bookmarks, the children can easily recognize the toughness of the veins and learn about cellulose which plays an important role in it
        </DIV><DIV class="xstitle">
            b)   Making cell model with plasticine
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            The second course we set up called “Making cell model with plasticine”. We introduced the cell model to children simply and took them to make cell models with plasticine. Under our careful guidance, the children succeeded in making beautiful cell models. After class, the children said they were happy to learn the structure of cell today.
        </DIV><DIV class="smtitle"> Exploring the micro world</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            After finishing the course of “Making cell model with plasticine”, we led the children to observe the real cells with microscopes. We also offer different types of slices, taking them to operate the microscope and introduce related knowledge to them.
        </DIV><DIV class="smtitle"> “Cellulose Go” Stage Play</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            We have adapted our project “Straw-Degrading Energy E.coli” into a stage play called “Cellulose Go” to explain our project. In the play, our protagonist “Cellulose” is an adventurer who is aiming at exploring ways to change herself into clean energy. But she was prisoned by the big devil, lignin. At this time, 3 warriors from UESTC take their plasmid sword to save the cellulose and help her change into clean energy.
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            It was a play that combined knowledge and fun. The stage play was so interesting that the children all burst out laughing. We also set some questions after our play to see whether children have learned from it. We were impressed by a girl who not only gave us the right answer of “Why butanol is harmful to bacterial” but also explained her choice perfectly with the plot in our play.
        </DIV><DIV class="smtitle"> Gene Card</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            We invited children to play gene card. Children had fun and learned synthetic biology’s basic process and tools in the game. Gene card successfully provoked their interest to synthetic biology.
        </DIV><DIV class="smtitle"> Learning about iGEM</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            We have designed several posters about iGEM and Synthetic Biology for exhibition, introducing what is iGEM and what we are doing for changing the world.

            We held a lab open day which attracted students of Chengdu NO.7 middle school. We introduced iGEM to them and showed them around our lab. At last we let them do some basic experiments and they experienced the real life of lab.

            In order to increase the influence of iGEM in the southwest region and facilitate the participation of iGEM events in the southwest region, some members of the iGEM school team of our university went to Chengdu no. 4 high school for recruitment and publicity. We spread the knowledge of iGEM to them, and answer questions for students who are willing to form a team. With our help, they establish an iGEM team this year.

            “Gene Card online” is a turn-based online card game adapting from our product, “Gene Card”, which is a card game based on synthetic biology and genetic engineering. The game is a turn-based game. Through the game between players, the first to get six different base cards will win the game. It was very popular among iGEMers last year, so we decide to put it online.

            Using coli as a prototype, we created a series of emoticon similar to Emoji for iGEMers’ daily use. All expressions are drawn by members of UESTC-China and they are still being added. Their inspiration comes from our daily and experiments, even our educational product. And now, we are trying to applying for qualification of putting it on emoticon store such as WeChat and Twitter.
