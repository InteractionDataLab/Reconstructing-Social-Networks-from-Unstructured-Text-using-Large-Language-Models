</DIV><DIV class="smtitle"> Team Leader</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">Jianzhe Yang and Changyu Li are our team leaders. As team leaders, they were responsible for the coordination of the team, and supervised experimental details to promote the experimental process. At the meantime, Jianzhe Yang contacted with biological companies to buy related reagents. The role Changyu Li played in the experiment was mainly to finish the construction and verification of vectors.</DIV><DIV class="smtitle"> Part Construction &amp; Interlab</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">Changyu Li, Huishuang Tan, Shizhi Ding, Yinsong Xu, Yansong Wang and Yetao Zou all contributed to part construction. All parts that need to submit were constructed by them.   Additionally, Shizhi Ding and Yinsong Xu were both responsible for interlab and making great effort in it.</DIV><DIV class="smtitle"> Experiments in Straw Degradation</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">Shizhi Ding and Yinsong Xu were mainly responsible for experiments in straw degradation. They construct the plasmid of straw degradation and conduct it into different E. coli strains. For the final product in this step, they finish the detection of ferulic acid by gas chromatography as well as xylose and glucose qualitatively by TLCA</DIV><DIV class="smtitle"> Experiments in Butanol Production</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">Changyu Li and Huishuang Tan were mainly responsible for experiments in butanol production. Additionally, they measured the titer of butanol by gas chromatography. They also studied the improvement of the resistance of E. coli to butanol by GroESL.</DIV><DIV class="smtitle"> Cellulose Enzyme Assay</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">Yetao Zou and Liang Zhao were mainly responsible for enzyme assay. They detected the activity and the extracellular expression of cellulose. </DIV><DIV class="smtitle"> Experiments in Hydrogen Production</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">Jiayi Yin and Yansong Wang were mainly responsible for experiments in hydrogen production. They construct the plasmid of straw degradation and conduct it into different E. coli strains. In addition, they finish the detection of Hydrogen by gas chromatography and another team member, Qi Wang set up a hydrogen collection device.</DIV><DIV class="smtitle"> Human Practices</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">Yuxian Zhang, Longjing Pan, Jianzhe Yang were mainly responsible for human practices and Jianzhe Yang, Changyu Li, Yinsong Xu, Xiang Zhou and Qi Wang also make contribution to it. They had made the following contributions ：</DIV><DIV class="xstitle"><STRONG>Support project：</STRONG></DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">Longjing Pan and Yuxian Zhang carried out a variety of questionnaires to survey the current situation of treating straw and citizen’s attitude toward clean energy. To make our project more practical, they interact with expert in Biogas Institute of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs to learn more information about agricultural waste and bioenergy. They also interviewed synthetic biology expert, Dr. Junbiao Dai to optimize our pathway.</DIV><DIV class="xstitle"><STRONG>Public Engagement：</STRONG></DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">Yuxian Zhang and Changyu Li organized a large event of Education of Public Engagement called “Gene go”, interacting with more than 300 families in Sichuan Science and Technology Museum. They are also making effort in high school students, inspiring their interest in synthetic biology. There are other team members designed some product such as “Gene Card” online programed by Xiang Zhou and Qi Wang, Crazy Lab designed by Yinsong Xu and Plasmid Rubik made by Longjing Pan. Collaboration and meet-up is in the charge of Yuxian Zhang and Jianzhe Yang to combine universities to solve the problems that was hardly solved by themselves.</DIV><DIV class="smtitle"> Modeling</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">Zijian Wu was mainly responsible for modeling. In order to maximize the production of butanol and hydrogen, it is necessary to optimize the fermentation of butanol and hydrogen. He first screened out the significant influence factors of the fermentation reaction. Next, he used response surface methodology to establish a functional relationship between the product and the significant influence factor. He used Box-Behnken to design test points to get the data he needed. He finally found the optimum conditions for the fermentation reaction.</DIV><DIV class="smtitle"> Art Design</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">Xieyi Liu and Jiayi Yin were mainly responsible for art design. As art designers, they focused on cooperation and contacted with Human Practice, Wiki and experiment. Their work included our team logo, team uniform, the design of the page and illustrations of Wiki as well as the posters and PPTs required for meetings such as Southwest Alliance and CCiC. They also joined in the design of our educational product, such as “Crazy Lab” etc.</DIV><DIV class="smtitle"> Wiki</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">Qichen Pan was mainly responsible for the establishment of our Wiki page. During the whole project, he warmly cooperated with art designers and designed a set of Wiki style. He was in charge of coding and debugging. Meanwhile, he collected project content from other members and delivered it to the website and ensured complete display of Wiki.</DIV><P id="2" class="konghang" style="text-indent:30.0pt;line-height:200%;"><SPAN style="font-family:'Candara',sans-serif; font-size:15.0pt; color:black; "> </SPAN></P><DIV class="bigtitle">
