            Overview
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            To establish a bond which connect synthetic biology and the public, we devoted ourselves vigorously to public education. We hosted &quot;Gene Go&quot;, a giant education event which drives the public participation in synthetic biology. We promote iGEM in a more innovative way, such as DIY classroom and stage play adapted from our project. We also open up &quot;iGEM Classroom&quot; which contains experiment practice and iGEM classes both online and offline for teenagers. It impressed them deeply and even embraved them forming their own iGEM team. Furthermore, we created a series of edutainment products such as Crazy Lab (a MOBA game), Gene Card Online (an online board game), Plasmid Rubik and E.mocoli (online emoticon) to bring more fun in education. Above all, what we created was not only an edutainment product, but also a carrier of iGEM and synthetic biology which output influence no matter where it is.
        </DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="bigtitle">
            “Gene Go!”
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            “Gene Go!” was held in Sichuan Science and Technology Museum (SCSTM) on June 17 by UESTC-China and UESTC-Software. It is an event of Education and Public Engagement. We released information on the activities through the platform of SCSTM. Within one day, we received registration forms from more than 300 families, reaching the maximum capacity of the activity.
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            “Gene Go!” includes five section, such as DIY classroom, “Cellulose Go!” Stage Play, Exploring the micro world etc. We created an atmosphere of synthetic biology, telling people what is iGEM and what we’re doing for the world. Through this event, we interacted more with the public and received feedbacks from them as well.
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            “Gene Go!” was appreciated by SCSTM as well as a lot of parents. They both expected us to hold this great event next year.

            DIY Classroom
        </DIV><DIV class="xstitle">
            a)	Making a leaf vein bookmark
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            Based on cellulose, which plays an important part in our project, we set up our first course called “Making a leaf vein bookmark”. Through the process of making vein bookmarks, the children can easily learn about cellulose which leads to the toughness of leaf veins.
        </DIV><DIV class="xstitle">
            b)	Making cell model with plasticine
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            The second course we set up is called “Making cell model with plasticine”. We introduced the cell model to children simply and took them to make cell models with plasticine. Under our careful guidance, the children succeeded in making beautiful cell models. After class, the children said they were happy to learn the structure of cell today.
        </DIV><DIV class="smtitle">
            Exploring the micro world
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            After finishing the course of “Making cell model with plasticine”, we led the children to observe the real cells with microscopes. We also offered different types of slices, inviting them to operate the microscope and introduced related knowledge to them.
        </DIV><DIV class="smtitle">
            “Cellulose Go” Stage Play
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            We have adapted our project “Straw-Degrading Energy E.coli” into a stage play called “Cellulose Go” to explain our project. In the play, our protagonist “Cellulose” is an adventurer who is aiming at exploring ways to change herself into clean energy. But she was prisoned by the big devil, lignin. At this time, 3 warriors from UESTC take their plasmid sword to save the cellulose and help her change into clean energy.
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen"><DIV>
                It was a play that combined knowledge and fun. The stage play was so interesting that the children all burst out laughing. We also set some questions after our play to see whether children have learned something from it. We were impressed by a girl who not only gave us the right answer of “Why butanol is harmful to bacterial” but also explained her choice perfectly with the plot in our play.
            </DIV><DIV>
                We also collected their opinions to our project this year in the form of questionnaire and talks. Most of them express their expectation of our project.
            </DIV><DIV>
                “It is a very good work. I believe it will make some changes.”
            </DIV><DIV>
                “It brings me about a completely new understanding of synthetic biology. We have never thought that we can realize such a thing through it.”
            </DIV></DIV><DIV class="smtitle">
            Gene Card
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            We invited children to play Gene Card. Children had fun and learned synthetic biology’s basic process and tools in the game. Gene card successfully provoked their interest to synthetic biology.
        </DIV><DIV class="smtitle">
            Learning about iGEM
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            We have designed several posters about iGEM and Synthetic Biology for exhibition, introducing what is iGEM and what we are doing for changing the world.

            iGEM Classroom
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            We set up a series of iGEM courses for High school students instead of simple lectures. As the saying goes “The best way to learn is to practice”, we held a summer camp with lab visiting and offer them a chance to do experiment themselves. Besides, we open up our iGEM classroom both online and offline for them to learn more about iGEM. It impressed them deeply and even embraved them establishing their own team.
        </DIV><DIV class="smtitle">
            iGEM Summer camp
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            We held a lab open day which attracted students of Chengdu NO.7 middle school. We introduced iGEM to them and showed them around in our laboratories, as well as introducing them our experiment equipment.
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            Then we began our class of Plasmids extraction. We guide them to do some basic experiments and they experienced the real life of lab. We also talked with them and received some feedback:
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            “A wonderful experience. I had never thought that it was such a hard work until I did it myself.”
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            “Thanks to your careful guidance! It is really exciting when my plasmid concentration was detected to be in a normal level.”
        </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
            “Experiment needs patience, determination and circumspection. It is really a hard work, because you have to endure much failure during the experiment and go on to do it again…Of course it is me!”
