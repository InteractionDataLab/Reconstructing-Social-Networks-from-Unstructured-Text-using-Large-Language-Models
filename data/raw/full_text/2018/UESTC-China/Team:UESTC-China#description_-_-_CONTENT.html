At present, China's annual straw production is about 800 million tons (2017), and it is increasing at a rate of about 12 million tons per year[1]. However, more than 20% of the straws are discarded or burned every year, and only 1/3 of them are returned to the field; in America, about 200 million tons of corn stalks is obtained each year, and a large part of it is used for returning to the field or as animal coarse grains[2]. However, due to the high content of lignocellulose, the straw has a stable structure, which causes its application difficulties and a large amount of waste of resources.</P><P>We select corn stalks as our research object. In order to solve the problem of renewable utilization of corn stalks, we propose a method of decomposing corn stalks by using a combination of xylanase and ferulic acid esterase and converting it into butanol or hydrogen. And we also hope that this project can inspire other straw treatments. </P></DIV><DIV id="Harm"><H2>Current status of straw</H2><P>The main components of corn stalks are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The cellulose content is the most, and D-glucose is formed by hydrogen bonding with a β-1,4-glycosidic bond. The second most abundant is hemicellulose, a complex polysaccharide composed of different types of monosaccharides (mainly five-carbon sugars such as xylose, arabinose and six-carbon sugars such as galactose, glucose). The lowest content is lignin, accounting for about 19% to 23%. However, due to the high stability of lignin, it can provide strength and hardness for plant cells, and the natural degradation rate is slow, which directly affects the utilization efficiency of straw[3].</P></DIV><DIV id="Technology"><H2>Ways to solve</H2><P>For agricultural powers such as China and America, the use of straw is both a problem and an opportunity.</P><P>Among the numerous straw treatments, we believe that converting straw into clean energy is the best choice. Now the most mature technology is to convert straw to produce ethanol, which is very effective, but it is still not good enough. Hydrogen and butanol belong to the new type of gas and liquid fuel respectively, which is an important research direction of new clean energy[7]. Therefore, hydrogen and butanol were selected as the final products of our corn straw treatment method.</P><P>At present, the main degradation methods of corn stalks include: physical treatment, chemical treatment and biological treatment. Among them, the physical treatments has a high cost and is not suitable for large-scale industrial applications, and the acid or alkali remaining in the chemical treatment may cause environmental pollution[4]. Therefore, under the comprehensive consideration, we decided to use biological treatment to improve the physical and chemical properties of corn stalks and degrade wood fiber by using one or several kinds of microorganisms to cooperate, and joint with various means such as biological enzymes to fundamentally improve the physical and chemical properties of corn stalks and the nutritional composition of corn stalks[4]. However, biological treatments still have problems such as strict growth conditions of the strain and low enzyme activity. Based on this, we propose to use a combination of xylanase and ferulic acid esterase to efficiently treat straw, and then design a pathway to convert the treated product into a clean energy such as butanol or hydrogen.</P></DIV><DIV id="Strategy"><H2>Our engineering bacteria</H2><P>We assume building two pathways to achieve the entire process from corn stalks to butanol and hydrogen. The combination of xylanase and ferulic acid esterase expressed by transfection is used to cut the chemical bond between lignin and lignin and cellulose and lignin in corn stalks, thereby realizing cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin by physicochemical methods. The cellulase is then used to break down the cellulose to obtain glucose, and the conversion process from glucose to butanol and hydrogen is achieved.</P></DIV><DIV id="References"><H2>REFERENCES:</H2><OL><LI>China Straw Net China's crop straw comprehensive utilization value and current status 2017-01-21</LI><LI>China straw network Comprehensive utilization of crop straws Environmental protection significance 2018-05-10</LI><LI> Xu Xiaokai, Shi Ning, Guo Yuqin, Jiang Linshu, Li Yanling  Advances in research on improving corn straw utilization rate.
