       This summer, we collaborated with nine 2018 iGEM teams for a better progress in project of each other. We received help from 2 teams, SCU-China and Jiangnan in equipment and chassis cells. We also help 2 teams, CDHSU-CHINA and CSU_CHINA set up their team and mentor their work. Besides, we developed cooperative relationship with 4 team, BNU-China, NEFU_China, BUCT-China and UESTC-Software to fulfill our project. Moreover, it was the most fantastic thing that we have a spark with NCKU_Tainan of combining our project together and making use of our side product as well as solving their problems of xylose resource. <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:UESTC-China/Collaborations">Click here for more details about our Collaborations. </A></DIV><DIV class="smtitle"><SPAN>☑</SPAN>  Human Practices</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
        We have thought carefully and creatively about whether our work is responsible and good for the world.

        We conducted a survey for both farmers and other citizens to get their views of the current treatment of straw and clean energy. We found that the phenomenon of burning straw still exists and utilization rate of it is particularly low. Besides, citizen's attitude toward clean energy is friendly but they are still not willing to use it. After understanding the basic situation of straw treatment and clean energy, we have communicated with professionals from Biogas Institute of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs to understand the current research progress in this field so as to improve our design. We got more information about obstacle in current research of reusing straw, as well as analysis of advantages and improvement in our project. After those above, we consulted biologist in our project to further optimize the pathway and experiment design in a more professional perspective. <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:UESTC-China/Human_Practices">Click here for more details about our Human Practices.</A></DIV><DIV class="smtitle"><SPAN>☑</SPAN>  Improve a previous part</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">

        1. We designed the experiment scientifically, and obtained the output equation of the product by using the experimental data. Then, we obtained the optimal fermentation conditions and maximum yield.  And the validity of the optimal fermentation conditions was verified by experiments.

        2. Molecular dynamics models of butanol and hydrogen production systems were also established. For the butanol production system, we find the reaction speed limiting step and the sensitive parameters. For the hydrogen production system, it is theoretically proved that the hydrogen production of the constructed <I>Escherichia coli</I> is relatively high. <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:UESTC-China/Model">Click here for more details about our Model. </A></DIV><DIV class="smtitle"><SPAN>☑</SPAN>   Demonstration of Your Work</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">

    </DIV><DIV class="smtitle"><SPAN>☑</SPAN>Best Energy Project</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
        UESTC-China is focusing on where energy is coming from and where it is going. Straw is our energy source in our project. It is produced in high quantity every year all over the world, but in low usage rate because of its complex structure. We used Xyn10D-Fae1A to efficiently degrade straw without pretreatment. Meanwhile, by taking into account that fossil fuel will be exhausted sooner or later and clean energy will become the trend of the future. Thus, our system was designed aiming at the production of hydrogen and butanol. After about five months’hard work, we successfully constructed an energy conversion system which could degrade straw into butanol and hydrogen.

        To establish a bond which connect synthetic biology and public, we devoted ourselves vigorously to public education. We hosted “Gene Go”, a giant public education event which drove the public participation in synthetic biology. We promote iGEM in a more innovative way, such as DIY classroom and stage play adapted from our project. We also open up “iGEM Classroom” for teenagers which contains experiment practice and iGEM classes both online and offline. It impressed them deeply and even embraved them forming their own iGEM team. Furthermore, we created a series of edutainment product such as Crazy Lab (a MOBA game), Gene Card Online, Plasmid Rubik and E.mocoli (online emoticon) to bring more fun in education. Above all, what we created was not only an edutainment product, but also a carrier of iGEM and synthetic biology which output influence no matter where it is. <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:UESTC-China/Public_Engagement">Click here for more details about our Education &amp; Public Engagement.</A></DIV><DIV class="smtitle"><SPAN>☑</SPAN>  Best Model</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
        Our team should be in consideration for this award for embodying the value of continuous interplay between theory and experiment.
    </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
        1. In order to find the best fermentation conditions, we designed the experiment and used the experimental data to produce butanol function. The optimal fermentation conditions and maximum yield were obtained for the optimal solution of the function. Then we experimented it again under the best fermentation conditions, and the results showed that the yield was obviously increased. This reflects the guidance of the model to the experiment and experimental support to the model.
    </DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
        2. We established a molecular dynamics model for biochemical reactions. For the butanol production system, we find the reaction speed limiting step and the sensitive parameters. For the hydrogen production system, we have theoretically proved that the hydrogen production of the constructed Escherichia coli is relatively high. This theoretically demonstrates the feasibility of the project. <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:UESTC-China/Model">Click here for more details about our Model. </A></DIV><DIV class="smtitle"><SPAN>☑</SPAN>  Best Integrated Human Practices</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">

        Gene Card Online is an online board game developed by Team UESTC-China, realizing the organic combination of synthetic biology and board game. The most basic elements of synthetic biology are clearly delivered to people under the condition of victory, which is the combination of restriction enzyme, DNA ligase, vector, target gene, bacteria and PCR, and they can understand what synthetic biology is in the process of enjoying the game. This fills the blank of Software Tool about promoting synthetic biology. Putting a board game online can further expand the impact of the our project to drive the development of the project itself. It can be transmitted any place at any time in the world that has access to Internet. It can not only help iGEMer around the world to promote iGEM activities, but also help the contributors of synthetic biology to popularize synthetic biology more vividly. <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:UESTC-China/Software">Click here for more details about our Software Tool.</A></DIV><DIV class="smtitle"><SPAN>☑</SPAN> Best New Basic Part</DIV><DIV class="zhengwen">
        Xyn10D-Fae1A is a new bifunctional enzyme, which has the activity of ferulic esterase and xylanase and could directly degrade straw without pretreatment. In detail, Feruloyl esterase can hydrolyze ferulic acid ester groups, which are responsible for attaching in complex cellular cell wall structures. Xylanase can hydrolyze plant cell wall component xylan.  <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2617000">Click here for more details about our New Basic Part.</A></DIV></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="hehe" style="background-color:balck"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12 " style="text-alien: center; vertical-alien: middle; font-size: 127%; text-align: center;">Copyright © 2018 iGEM UESTC-China </DIV><DIV class="col-md-12" style="text-alien: center; vertical-alien: middle; font-size: 127%; text-align: center;"><DIV class="social-icons" style="font-size: 170%;">   </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
