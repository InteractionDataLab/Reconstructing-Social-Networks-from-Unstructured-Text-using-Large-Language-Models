                year. According to a recent paper in Nature Microbiology, this issue is expected to deteriorate even further to 10 million annual deaths by 2050<SUP>[1]</SUP>. This has lead both the United Nations (UN) and World Health Organisation
                (WHO) to

                One of the main causes of the antibiotic resistance crisis is the lack of new antibiotic discoveries. Research is being conducted to discover new antibiotics, however only a handful of new antibiotics have been found in the last
                three decades<SUP>[4]</SUP>. The field of antibiotics is not lucrative enough for pharmaceutical companies and newly discovered compounds remain similar in function to current antibiotics. As a result companies like Novartis and Big
                Pharma are
                retreating from the research field, while the need for new antibiotics keeps increasing<SUP>[8]</SUP>. During our conversation with <SPAN class="blobs XXL"><A class="popoutBlob">

                Although discovering new antibiotics can temporarily address the antibiotic resistance crisis, this does not prevent resistance from forming towards these new antibiotics. Therefore, research into novel antibiotics comprises a

                The teacher does not give them any sort of prior information but through doing the exercise the students will learn about the topic. The advantage of the problem based learning is that information is remembered much better by

                students at the Da Vinci College high school. The students, aged 16/17, of the Da Vinci College tried our workshop as well. They were very motivated to finish the escape room. During our discussion we found out that most students did
                hear about this problem before, but they were not too worried. The main reason was because they thought they could not affect the rate of antibiotic resistance. During our presentation we discussed ways in which they could make a
                change. When the workshop was complete, the students knew more about how their actions can affect the rate of resistance and both students and teachers were very positive about the workshop.

                When we started our project, we identified two main problems in antibiotic resistance by talking to health experts. Firstly, no new antibiotics are being found, and secondly, our current antibiotics are often misused, thereby fueling
                resistance. To solve the first problem, we developed a bacterial stress screening kit based on repeated expert feedback. This kit can be used to discover novel antibiotic combination therapies. To tackle the second problem, we spoke
                to experts involved in policy and public engagement of antibiotic resistance to create an interactive workshop which uses an escape room to explain the problem of antibiotic resistance. Additionally, we decided - together with
                business and marketing experts - to make our research available open source, and we have updated all research groups we were in contact with that our cell lines have been completed. We hope that other research teams will pick up our
                research to fight antibiotic resistance with the help of our cell lines and the 50S.O.S. screening kit.
