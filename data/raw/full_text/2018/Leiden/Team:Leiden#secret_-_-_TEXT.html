Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance poses a serious threat to global public health. The number of drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria is rapidly rising, while only a handful of new marketable antibiotics have been introduced in the past three decades. Most antibiotics       that are currently in use target an essential cellular process, thereby killing the pathogen. iGEM Leiden aims to establish an innovative screening system that enables us to rapidly discover compounds that stress bacterial cells. We will therefore       create a library of reporters that respond to stresses in different cellular pathways, by fusing stress-induced promotors to pigmented chromoproteins in E. coli. In this manner, stress-inducing compounds can be rapidly       discovered and developed for application in combination therapy, aimed at inducing synthetic lethality.
