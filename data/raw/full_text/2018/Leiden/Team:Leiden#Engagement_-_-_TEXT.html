Events
Synthetic biology brings great opportunities for innovative applications, tackling major societal problems. However, as with all applications, they are made to be used by people. Therefore, it is vital to keep these people in mind during the       design       process and to have them on board with our plans. To that end, we are engaging with all people and organizations associated to our project by visiting a variety of events. Scroll down to see what activities we have participated in. You can       read more about the ideas behind our awareness campaign on our Education and Public Engagement page .

Science Day - Hannover Messe Challenge
Five members of our team attended the science day at Twente University, to enthuse high school students for a study in beta or life sciences. During the event we gave a workshop on synthetic biology, explaining the basics         of synthetic biology to         25 motivated higher secondary education students.
The workshop started with a presentation on the usefulness of bacteria and the advantages that synthetic biology offer us. Thereafter, the students received a taste of biological         research         by performing three small experiments, including DNA visualization, ‘agar art’ with colored bacteria and a test to discover where the most bacteria live; e.g. on your phone, the toilet or your hands, and before or after washing? During the         experiments,         the students were stimulated to think about the biology behind the experiments. For instance, discussing the source of the bacteria’s pink color. It was gratifying to see the students enthusiastically discuss and perform the experiments,         being         eager to learn about synthetic biology.
We want to give a big shout out to Twente University for inviting us to this great educational event.

RIVM: Safe by Design
To kickstart our brainstorming on the Human Practices behind our project, we met with the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and with the Rathenau Institute, tasked with supporting the         public and political discussion         of science. During the day we pitched our idea to the RIVM and other Dutch iGEM teams. Afterwards, 7 experts from the fields of policy & law, societal impact, safety & security, business and ethics enriched us with their knowledge and         thoughts         on our project. This provided us with many valuable insights and helped us to firmly include Human Practices into all the steps of our project. Additionally, the day provided a nice opportunity to meet up with the other Dutch iGEM teams,         allowing         us to exchange ideas and get to know each other better.

Industry Day
The city of Leiden has a rich history of scientists and artists engaging their work to find solutions to problems and explore the scientific and ethical boundaries of curiosity. At Industry day, we kept that tradition         alive by bringing scientists         and artist into one room and displaying our work. iGEM Leiden team member, Germaine Aalderink, had prepared two large pieces of agar art for the occasion, using colored bacteria as ‘paint’. Sadly, bacterial infections took hold on the large         homemade         agar containers leading to the art being overgrown. Fortunately we were able to use this loss to further emphasize the need for antibiotics and to raise awareness for the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.
We also had the opportunity to have discussions with fascinating artists. A favorite was Auke-Florian Hiemstra, a biologist and artist who uses his art as a medium to raise awareness for an endangered squid species. Hiemstra made us realize         that - although         graphs are a scientific method to show a negative trend - art is a way to emotionally involve the viewer an make them truly realise the problem and the need to solve it.

Science meets Business Café
The Science Meets Business Café is a monthly meeting of scientists and bioscience company representatives, with the goal of stimulating cooperation between them. During the final Café event before the summer break, we         presented our project and opened         the discussion with scientists and businesspeople alike. It was motivating to receive many positive reactions to our project and the subsequent drinks allowed us to delve into further details with interested individuals. The afternoon         provided         us valuable new contacts and allowed us to further spread our ideas and the added value of synthetic biology.

Netherlands Biotechnology Conference
At the Netherlands Biotechnology Conference promising developments in biotechnology were discussed. During the day we attended pitches and lectures given by researchers and students from universities, companies - such as         DSM - and the Rathenau Institute.         We also presented our project via a posterpitch and held interesting discussions with the many participants at the conference. Particularly the critical questions on our project helped us challenge our plans and decisions. For example,         making         us think of why we choose to use plasmids over incorporating our system directly into the bacterial genome. Furthermore, the conference was another opportunity to make contact with Dutch iGEM teams, including members of the winning Delft         iGEM         team of 2017. This allowed us to gather many tips and tricks. Finally, we made contact with several speakers who offered us support and guidance during our project to combat antibiotic resistance. Altogether, the Netherlands Biotechnology         Conference         provided us with inspiring day where we made many new contacts and promoted our iGEM project!

Museum Night
The Leiden Museum Night is an annual event which promotes the visiting of museums. During the night, the museums of Leiden open their doors and offer special workshops and lectures. This year, we stood in the Botanical         garden where we gave a workshop         in agar art. Our goal was to make people more familiar with bacteria and take away some of the stigma surrounding them. The workshop was appropriate for all ages and we got very positive feedback from both children and elders. Besides this         we         had a stand with our poster and flyers where we explained our project and the issue of antibiotics resistance to the visitors. We had great conversations and got to understand the fears people have when it comes to GMO's and bacteria. We         were         very glad to see that many people were interested in our project and supported our work. The night was a great success and the many pictures of brightly colored bacteria drawings warmed our heart.

Werfpop
On the 8th of July we organised a “Drawing with bacteria” workshop at Werfpop, a free music and art festival in Leiden. We were invited by Science meets Business to organise a workshop involving some crazy science. We         decided to do bacterial painting         with coloured bacteria. Nothing was visible while painting, but after three days the bacteria grew and the drawings magically appeared. We were really impressed by all the amazing works of art people made! The workshop was a great success         with         both young and old participating. Besides the drawing we also explained our project to anyone who was interested.
Lastly, we asked participants to vote in favor or against genetic modification to see what the general public thought.         Votes         were cast by adding coloured liquid to large eppendorfs. The final tally showed 110 votes in favor and 45 votes against. The voting allowed us to have many great discussions with the Werfpop visitors on our project and genetic engineering as         a         whole.

Workshop at EL CID Leiden University Introduction Week
On the 16th of July, fresh Leiden University students were already on their fourth day of the El Cid introduction week. During this day, we had the opportunity to teach students about our project, synthetic biology and the threat of         antibiotic resistance. At our stand during the El Cid symposium, we provided the opportunity for students to draw using colourful bacteria, while enthusiastic students were allowed to tackle our newly created “Escape the Resistance” escape         room game. It was great fun to engage with the future students of our university and show them all the amazing things we got to do as an iGEM team. Lastly, the day provided us a great opportunity to gather feedback on our Read more about this feedback and our escape room on our Education & Public Engagement page escape room game.

Night of Discoveries
The Night of Discoveries is an annual science festival in Leiden which attracts large crowds of people with diverse ages. During the night, we performed a version of our “Escape the Resistance” workshop adapted to larger crowds. Over 300         colourful bacteria drawings were made and many people tested their antibiotic knowledge with our escape room game. Additionally, we loved having another opportunity to speak to people about our project and synthetic biology.

Workshop at Da Vinci College High School
Our final test of our “Escape the Resistance” workshop was performed at the local High School: Davinci College. Here, we taught a large group of final year high school students about the possibilities of synthetic biology, and the dangers of         antibiotic resistance. It was interesting to learn that most students were not that worried about antibiotic resistance, even though they were already aware of the problem. They stated their main reason for this was because they couldn’t do         anything about it. Therefore, we were happy to learn them how any member of society can help tackle the antibiotic resistance crisis through better handling of our current antibiotics.

Leiden Science Family Day
The Leiden Science Family Day was a fun opportunity to let faculty members and other local families to teach their children about science. We gladly took this chance to teach children about the fun things you can do using bacteria. This was         shown to them by allowing them to draw with colourful bacteria. Additionally, we took this opportunity to talk to parents about antibiotic resistance, and the threat it poses to our future. Particularly these parents were eager to learn         about the issue of resistance as their children would grow up in this world. Therefore, they were also glad to learn all the ways they can help prevent the spread of resistance, by using antibiotics responsibly.
