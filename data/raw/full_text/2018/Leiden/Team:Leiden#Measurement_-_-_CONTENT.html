        As our project depends on reliable detection of bacterial cell stress using reporter strains, we spent much time on creating reproducible measurement protocols. We decided to use Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) for quantitative measurements
        after <SPAN class="blobs"><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Leiden/Human_Practices" class="popoutBlob" target="_blank"> Read more about our consultation on our Integrated Human Practices page</A><SPAN> consultation</SPAN></SPAN> with
        potential users of our stress-detection system. However, agar plate-based applications of our system do not require detailed quantitative information on gene-expression, and would benefit from a cheap and simple
        readout. Therefore, we also designed a novel method for naked-eye detection of stress responses in <I>E. coli</I> using visual reporters based on chromoproteins. These reporter cell lines will change colour when exposed to stress.
        In the following chapters, our journey to obtaining a reliable measurement framework for both systems is explained, including interpretation of data and controls.
      </P></DIV><SECTION class="popout chapter"><DIV class="collapsible"> Fluorescence Measurements</DIV><DIV class="collapsibleContent"><P>
          There are several ways to measure the production of GFP in organisms. Popular methods include microscopy, flow cytometry and plate reader measurements<SUP>[1]</SUP>. For analysis of our system, predominantly flow cytometry and confocal
          microscopy was used. In the sections below, the choice for these two techniques will be explained. Furthermore, our journey to optimizing the experimental setup will be shown and data interpretation will be discussed.
        </P><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">Evaluating measurement methods</H2><P>
          Two of the most common methods of quantifying GFP expression in <I>E. coli</I> are plate reader and flow cytometry measurements<SUP>[1]</SUP>. Using plate readers is an easy and accessible setup for relatively high-throughput GFP
          measurement.
          Therefore, we aim to implement such measurements in our <SPAN class="blobs"><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Leiden/Applied_Design" class="popoutBlob" target="_blank">Read more about our design process on our Product Design page</A><SPAN>
              final product design.</SPAN></SPAN> However, plate reader measurements give very little information about the cells apart from an optical density (OD) and fluorescence. With flow cytometry, we can
          obtain more details such as the extent of cell death and whether all cells display increased fluorescence or whether multiple are populations formed.
          Furthermore, plate reader measurements must be normalised to OD. In our project we routinely used substances that inhibit growth, creating a great variability in OD between samples. This has the potential to skew the data after
          normalisation of fluorescence to OD.
          Because of the aforementioned reasons, we chose to validate our strains with flow cytometry. For visual understanding and extra confirmation of the effect of antibiotics and other stressful substances on our strains, we used confocal
          microscopy.
        </P><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">Starting validation</H2><P>
          For flow cytometry, we started by testing whether this technique would be able to measure a GFP signal in <I>E. coli</I>. Hence we compared a wild-type <I>E. coli</I> DH5α strain and the GFP-expressing InterLab positive control
          (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I20270" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">BBa_I20270</A>) in flow cytometry experiments. As can be seen in figure 1, the fluorescence intensity is much higher for the InterLab strain indicating
          that this technique could successfully detect bacteria expressing GFP.
        </P><FIGURE class="resultfig horizontal"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 1. The GFP fluorescent signal measured for untreated wild-type DH5α versus an InterLab positive control strain (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I20270" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">BBa_I20270</A>).</B>
            A higher GFP signal was observed for the positive control demonstrating the ability of
            our protocol to detect GFP expression. </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>For the initial validation of our system we stressed our strains with a <SPAN class="blobs"><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Leiden/Results" class="popoutBlob" target="_blank">You can read more about the stressors we used on our Results
              page</A><SPAN> range of stressors </SPAN></SPAN>of which the mode of action is known. These stressors potentially have drastic influences on the detected GFP signal in flow cytometry by for
          example altering the morphology of the cells. For instance, cell elongation due to nalidixic acid treatment may cause an increase in detected fluorescence intensity regardless of a change in expression, leading to misinterpretation of the
          results<SUP>[2]</SUP>.
          We performed a series of experiments to test the influence of these stressors on autofluorescence and GFP expression of <I>E. coli</I>. For this purpose, we performed experiments with <I>E. coli</I> DH5α to establish the levels of
          autofluorescence with and without stressor treatment (Figure 2). As a second control experiment, we took the positive control provided in the InterLab studies (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I20270" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">BBa_I20270</A>)
          and repeated the experiment to understand the influence of
          antibiotics on measured GFP expression (Figure 3).
        </P><FIGURE class="resultfig horizontal"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 2. The effect of stressor treatment on autofluorescence of wild-type DH5α.</B> No significant increase or decrease of detected GFP signal as a results of stressor treatment was observed.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><FIGURE class="resultfig horizontal"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 3. The effect of stressor treatment on constitutive GFP expression by the InterLab positive control (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I20270" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">BBa_I20270</A>). </B> The GFP
            signal was not found to increase significantly under any of the stressor conditions
            compared to the negative control (no stressor added, LB). Some stressors lead to a decrease in GFP signal.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>The data in figure 2 shows that stressor treatment had no significant influence on the autofluorescence of the DH5α wild-type strain.
          As can be seen in figure 3, no stressor lead to a significant increase in detected GFP expression or autofluorescence. Therefore we concluded that false positives as a result of a change in morphology or another effect caused by stressor
          treatment
          could not occur. We did not test for ampicillin as the plasmids used for validation were cloned in ampicillin resistance <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_pSB1A3" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">backbones</A>.
          Several antibiotics lead to a decrease in the GFP signal, as seen in figure 3. One might object with the argument that we will never detect a signal when we use these antibiotics.
          First of all, it should be noted that we are not necessarily looking at the strength of the signal, only at hits that exceed the negative control. A slight decrease in signal will therefore not be an issue.
          For hydrogen peroxide, chloramphenicol, zeocin, vancomycin and rifampicin we believe that the observed decrease is small enough to be overcome by stress-related induction of the promoters. This assumption is confirmed by our results. For
          instance, our pSoxS-GFP construct (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2610031" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">BBa_K2610031</A>) showed increased GFP expression for treatment with hydrogen peroxide and zeocin, and
          pKatG-GFP (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2610018" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">BBa_K2610018</A>) displayed an upregulation in response to hydrogen peroxide treatment.
          Tetracycline, streptomycin and kanamycin are protein synthesis inhibitors (PSIs), which explains the marked decrease in detected GFP signal<SUP>[3]</SUP>. Ideally, we would like to use a concentration where cells are stressed and no
          protein synthesis inhibition occurs. However, this is not realistic as it is unlikely stress occurs when no protein synthesis inhibition occurs. Therefore, we chose to keep using the same concentrations of these stressors while being
          careful with
          interpretation of results, using other PSIs as controls (to verify whether the response was specific) and by including extra controls when we suspected protein synthesis inhibitors caused stress-related promoter regulation. For example, in
          our <SPAN class="blobs"><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Leiden/Results" class="popoutBlob" target="_blank">Read our Results page for more information</A><SPAN> Results page</SPAN></SPAN>we discuss pCspA-GFP (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2610037" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">BBa_K2610037</A>), a reporter which appeared to be specifically downregulated by protein synthesis inhibitors. To
          test whether this was a regulatory effect and not simply inhibition of GFP production, we
          performed a confocal microscopy experiment where we included a pSoxS-mCherry strain as a positive control for protein synthesis. If the response was specific to pCspA, only GFP production would be inhibited and mCherry production would
          still be observed. This is indeed what we saw (Figure 4).
        </P><FIGURE class="resultfig"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 4. Use of extra controls to verify the effect of protein synthesis inhibitors on pCspA-GFP (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2610037" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">BBa_K2610037</A>). </B>pCspA is a
            promoter with a high base level of expression that appeared to be downregulated by exposure to
            protein synthesis inhibitors in our experiments. Our pSoxS-mCherry strain (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2610032" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">BBa_K2610032</A>) was included as a positive control for protein
            production. A: treatment with ampicillin as a negative control. B: Treatment with nalidixic acid for
            the induction of pSoxS-mCherry. This did not have much effect, but an mCherry signal can be seen in one cell. C: Treatment with kanamycin and nalidixic acid. GFP production has decreased while several cells with an mCherry signal remain,
            indicating that the kanamycin treatment has a specific effect on our pCspA-GFP strain.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">Good measurement practices and reproducibility</H2><P>After simple proof-of-concept GFP detection with the flow cytometer, we started validation of our GFP-expressing strains in response to stress. To increase reliability, every flow cytometer experiment was done either in duplo or in triplo
          on the plate, and experiments were repeated over the course of different days. Negative controls were blank LB medium, non-transformed <I>E. coli</I> DH5α and a reporter strain without the addition of a stressful compound. To prevent
          the additional production of GFP over the course of the experiment and to eliminate interference by particles that interfere with the flow cytometry measurements (e.g. salt crystals), cells were kept on ice and washed two times with cold
          PBS. 
          For confocal microscopy, only pictures taken on the same day under the same conditions were compared with each other. A wild-type DH5α was used as negative control to measure the autofluorescence, while a GFP reporter strain without
          any additional compounds was used to visualise the basal expression. 
          More details of the stress-inducement procedure as well as technical details and the equipment and settings used can be found on the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Leiden/Experiments" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">protocols page</A>.
        </P><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">Data analysis</H2><P>There are several ways to analyse flow cytometry data. One way is to gate the cloud which are presumably cells and to then only use data from that gate (Figure 5A). Alternatively, one can remove measurements that yielded no fluorescence,
          as all cells display a basic level of autofluorescence<SUP>[4]</SUP> (Figure 5B). </P><FIGURE class="resultfig"><FIGCAPTION><B> Figure 5. Two analysis methods of Fluorescence Flow Cytometry measurements. </B>Method A: A gate is selected around the cloud of the presumed cells and only data from cells within that gate will be used. Method B: A gate
            excluding the measurement points with a fluorescence of less than 1 is selected (see the black line above the x-axis). This method is based on the fact that cells have autofluorescence and the assumption can be made that particles with
            no
            fluorescence are not cells.
          </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>We analysed data from an experiment with both data interpretation techniques, the results are shown in figure 6. We can see that the absolute values differ, but the overall pattern is similar and the same conclusions can be drawn from
          both methods. Considering that the second method of removing measurements is more time efficient - especially with the large amount of experiments we had to analyse - we chose that method for further analysis.
        </P><FIGURE class="resultfig"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 6. GFP-signal graphs obtained using both methods of flow cytometry data analysis.</B>The absolute values of the signals differ based on the analysis method used. However, the ratios between the different stressors and
            the negative control are similar.
          </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>In terms of statistics, it was decided to represent the data with the geometric mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). It must be noted that MFI is sometimes used as an abbreviation for mean or median fluorescence intensity. Because we are
          generally dealing with very asymmetric populations, outliers - both low or high - will have a large influence on the mean intensity. We considered using the median intensity, which is common in flow cytometry experiments to represent a
          ‘typical’ member of the population<SUP>[5]</SUP>. However, in our results, it is more relevant to assess the entire population. Because of that, we decided to represent our data in geometric mean fluorescence intensity.
        </P><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">Fluorescence units</H2><P>The units of the detected GFP signal in flow cytometry are arbitrary and may differ greatly between repeat experiments. As such, absolute values of different measurements cannot be compared. This can be mitigated using calibration of
          fluorescence units to known standards, as performed in the <SPAN class="blobs"><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Leiden/InterLab" class="popoutBlob" target="_blank"> View our InterLab page for more information</A><SPAN> InterLab study</SPAN></SPAN>.
          However, for our experiments this is not of great importance because we only considered the difference in detected signal compared to a negative control, which was
          always included in the same experiment. This difference can be quantified in fold changes, which is the numeric value we used for comparisons between measurements.

          Besides GFP reporters, an important part of our project was the use of chromoproteins to create visual reporters. Similar to the stress-responsive GFP strains, careful thought was put into measuring and validating our chromoprotein
          strains. In the next section, a short explanation on our measurement methods, optimization of the experimental setup and analysis is provided.
        </P><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">Evaluating methods</H2><P>The idea to use chromoproteins for the detection of bacterial cell stress was prompted by conversations about <I>Streptomyces</I> overlays. For these experiments, a visible readout on agar plates is crucial. For initial validation of
          agar-plate based reporters, we employed disk diffusion experiments because they allowed for greater control of the antibiotic used and concentration thereof. In addition, we performed experiments in liquid culture to assess whether we
          could observe a dose-dependent response of our chromoprotein strains. </P><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">Starting validation</H2><P>Initially, to confirm that chromoproteins would be visible on agar plates and in liquid cultures, we created constructs that constitutively express blue and pink chromoproteins with our novel pGapA promoter (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2610040" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">BBa_K2610040</A>): pGapA-AmilCP
