Without their support it would not have been possible to successfully perform our experiments in
      the laboratory and promote or fundraise our project. Not only did they help in making this iGEM project possible, they have also contributed to making this experience incredibly fun! This page is dedicated to all these wonderful people and
      organisations.

The initial idea for our project was the result of an internship completed by our Science manager Marjolein Crooijmans under our PI Dennis Claessen. Although everyone
        had their own role to play within the team, we helped each other in all project aspects. We credit this willingness to help each other as the most important factor in our successes.</P></H2><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">Experimental Work</H2><P>In our lab we benefited from a very free working atmosphere, and even though people were assigned to a specific subproject we all pitched in and helped each other where needed. Before our project started, Marjolein worked on
        isolating our first 30 stress promoters and coupling them to GFP constructs to enable testing.</P><UL class="bullet"><LI>Charlotte de Ceuninck van Capelle and Germaine Aalderink</LI><LI class="description">Charlotte and Germaine were responsible for the selection of the bacillus subtilis promoters as well as transforming bacillus with a chromoprotein.</LI><LI>Daphne van den Homberg and Mees Fox</LI><LI class="description">Daphne created all our new promoter constructs using PCR. As a team, Daphne and Mees focussed on coupling these new promoters to GFP.</LI><LI>Maaike de Jong and Lotte Weel</LI><LI class="description">Maaike and Lotte occupied themselves with the construction of our composite plasmid.
        </LI><LI>Tim de Jong and Carli Koster</LI><LI class="description">Tim and Carli were responsible for the validation of our system using fluorescence-activated cell sorting.</LI><LI>Jazzy de Waard and Marijke Grundeken</LI><LI class="description">As antibiotics are traditionally discovered with the overlay techniques using streptomyces and <I>E. coli</I>, Jazzy and Marijke learned to perform this technique as well as disk diffusion. </LI><LI>Laurens ter Haar and Marjolein Crooijmans</LI><LI class="description">Laurens and Marjolein were concerned with enhancing our system so we could obtain a clear read-out. To this end they used T7.</LI><P>Furthermore, we want to thank exchange student Paula Regal Alonso for creating our constitutively expressed chromoprotein strains.</P><P>
          In addition we would like thank Julia Mullink, Nienke van Noort, Mike Johnson en Jo-Anne Verschoor for their contribution in the demonstration of our system.</P></UL><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">Fundraising and Finances</H2><P>Tim de Jong and Jazzy de Waard functioned as our Fundraising team and were mainly responsible for approaching sponsors and managing our crowdfunding campaign. Our treasurer Maaike de Jong safeguarded our finances and managed our budget with
        occasional help from Charlotte de Ceuninck van Capelle.
      </P><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">Design</H2><P>Our secretary and design manager Daphne van den Homberg designed all of our promotion materials, including flyers, banners, postcards et cetera with help from Laurens ter Haar and Chiel van Amstel.
      </P><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">Collaborations</H2><P>Carli Koster was responsible for the countless collaborations that we did with teams from all around the world, such as the postcards from team Düsseldorf, the Instagram Challenge for July and Moves Like iGEM amongst others. Charlotte de
        Ceuninck van Capelle managed the collaboration between Leiden and Rotterdam HR as well as the Dutch Meet-Up and BBQ.
      </P><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">Programming and Statistics</H2><P>All of our <SPAN title="Beautiful and easy to use">wiki</SPAN> programming and statistics were performed by Chiel van Amstel. Mathematical modelling was done by Jazzy de Waard, with help from Chiel van Amstel who visualised the results for the wiki.
      </P><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">Outreach and Social Media</H2><P>Our PR team, Carli Koster and Marijke Grundeken, managed all of our social media accounts and our monthly newsletter, while Mees Fox arranged for us to be present at local events to give workshops and talks about our project.
      </P><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">InterLab</H2><P>Charlotte de Ceuninck van Capelle arranged for iGEM Leiden to be able to use the transformed InterLab strains from team Delft. All InterLab experiments were performed by Chiel van Amstel and Jazzy de Waard.
      </P><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">Lab Safety</H2><P>Naturally, all of our team members took lab safety extremely seriously. However, Germaine Aalderink was responsible for arranging the GMO course everyone needed to complete in order to work in the ML-1 lab and for completing our safety
        form.
      </P><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">Presentations</H2><P>Laurens ter Haar presented our project at events like This Week’s Discovery and the Science Meets Business Cafe.
      </P><H2 class="SubSectionTitle">Wiki</H2><P>As our programming manager Chiel <SPAN title="SVG animations for the win!">designed</SPAN> and programmed the entire wiki. All team members contributed to writing the wiki but the final content was managed by Laurens ter Haar.</P></DIV><DIV class="UnderPageNav"><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Leiden/Team" class="NavBlock"><DIV class="NavBlockText"><SPAN>Team</SPAN>Click here to read more about our team members, advisors and PIs
