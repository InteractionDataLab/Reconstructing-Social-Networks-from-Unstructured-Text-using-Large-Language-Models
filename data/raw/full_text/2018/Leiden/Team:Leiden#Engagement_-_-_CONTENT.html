However, as with all applications, they are made to be used by people. Therefore, it is vital to keep these people in mind during the
      design
      process and to have them on board with our plans. To that end, we are engaging with all people and organizations associated to our project by visiting a variety of events. Scroll down to see what activities we have participated in. You can

During the event we gave a workshop on synthetic biology, explaining the basics
        of synthetic biology to
        25 motivated higher secondary education students. The workshop started with a presentation on the usefulness of bacteria and the advantages that synthetic biology offer us. Thereafter, the students received a taste of biological
        research
        by performing three small experiments, including DNA visualization, ‘agar art’ with colored bacteria and a test to discover where the most bacteria live; e.g. on your phone, the toilet or your hands, and before or after washing? During the
        experiments,
        the students were stimulated to think about the biology behind the experiments. For instance, discussing the source of the bacteria’s pink color. It was gratifying to see the students enthusiastically discuss and perform the experiments,
        being
        eager to learn about synthetic biology. We want to give a big shout out to Twente University for inviting us to this great educational event.

        public and political discussion
        of science. During the day we pitched our idea to the RIVM and other Dutch iGEM teams. Afterwards, 7 experts from the fields of policy &amp; law, societal impact, safety &amp; security, business and ethics enriched us with their knowledge and
        thoughts
        on our project. This provided us with many valuable insights and helped us to firmly include Human Practices into all the steps of our project. Additionally, the day provided a nice opportunity to meet up with the other Dutch iGEM teams,
        allowing
        us to exchange ideas and get to know each other better.

At Industry day, we kept that tradition
        alive by bringing scientists
        and artist into one room and displaying our work. iGEM Leiden team member, Germaine Aalderink, had prepared two large pieces of agar art for the occasion, using colored bacteria as ‘paint’. Sadly, bacterial infections took hold on the large
        homemade
        agar containers leading to the art being overgrown. Fortunately we were able to use this loss to further emphasize the need for antibiotics and to raise awareness for the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.
      </DIV><DIV class="cardtext">
        We also had the opportunity to have discussions with fascinating artists. A favorite was Auke-Florian Hiemstra, a biologist and artist who uses his art as a medium to raise awareness for an endangered squid species. Hiemstra made us realize
        that - although
        graphs are a scientific method to show a negative trend - art is a way to emotionally involve the viewer an make them truly realise the problem and the need to solve it.

During the final Café event before the summer break, we
        presented our project and opened
        the discussion with scientists and businesspeople alike. It was motivating to receive many positive reactions to our project and the subsequent drinks allowed us to delve into further details with interested individuals. The afternoon
        provided
        us valuable new contacts and allowed us to further spread our ideas and the added value of synthetic biology.

During the day we attended pitches and lectures given by researchers and students from universities, companies - such as
        DSM - and the Rathenau Institute.
        We also presented our project via a posterpitch and held interesting discussions with the many participants at the conference. Particularly the critical questions on our project helped us challenge our plans and decisions. For example,
        making
        us think of why we choose to use plasmids over incorporating our system directly into the bacterial genome. Furthermore, the conference was another opportunity to make contact with Dutch iGEM teams, including members of the winning Delft
        iGEM
        team of 2017. This allowed us to gather many tips and tricks. Finally, we made contact with several speakers who offered us support and guidance during our project to combat antibiotic resistance. Altogether, the Netherlands Biotechnology
        Conference
        provided us with inspiring day where we made many new contacts and promoted our iGEM project!

During the night, the museums of Leiden open their doors and offer special workshops and lectures. This year, we stood in the Botanical
        garden where we gave a workshop
        in agar art. Our goal was to make people more familiar with bacteria and take away some of the stigma surrounding them. The workshop was appropriate for all ages and we got very positive feedback from both children and elders. Besides this
        we
        had a stand with our poster and flyers where we explained our project and the issue of antibiotics resistance to the visitors. We had great conversations and got to understand the fears people have when it comes to GMO's and bacteria. We
        were
        very glad to see that many people were interested in our project and supported our work. The night was a great success and the many pictures of brightly colored bacteria drawings warmed our heart.

We were invited by Science meets Business to organise a workshop involving some crazy science. We
        decided to do bacterial painting
        with coloured bacteria. Nothing was visible while painting, but after three days the bacteria grew and the drawings magically appeared. We were really impressed by all the amazing works of art people made! The workshop was a great success
        with
        both young and old participating. Besides the drawing we also explained our project to anyone who was interested. Lastly, we asked participants to vote in favor or against genetic modification to see what the general public thought.
        Votes
        were cast by adding coloured liquid to large eppendorfs. The final tally showed 110 votes in favor and 45 votes against. The voting allowed us to have many great discussions with the Werfpop visitors on our project and genetic engineering as
        a
        whole.

        On the 16th of July, fresh Leiden University students were already on their fourth day of the El Cid introduction week. During this day, we had the opportunity to teach students about our project, synthetic biology and the threat of
        antibiotic resistance. At our stand during the El Cid symposium, we provided the opportunity for students to draw using colourful bacteria, while enthusiastic students were allowed to tackle our newly created “Escape the Resistance” escape
        room game. It was great fun to engage with the future students of our university and show them all the amazing things we got to do as an iGEM team. Lastly, the day provided us a great opportunity to gather feedback on our <SPAN class="blobs"><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Leiden/Public_Engagement" class="popoutBlob" target="_blank"> Read more about this feedback and our escape room on our Education &amp; Public Engagement page</A><SPAN> escape room game.</SPAN></SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="card links"><DIV class="title"><H1 class="date">04/09/2018</H1><H1 class="cardtitle">Workshop at Biomedical Sciences Introduction Day</H1></DIV><DIV class="cardtext">
        The next trial of our education workshop came during the introduction days of prospective Biomedical Sciences students. Here, we got the opportunity to engage students with our newly expanded workshop, which now also features an introductory
        interactive quiz and a presentation to provide additional insights into synthetic biology and antibiotic resistance. It was very pleasing to see the enthusiasm of these fresh students. They were eager to learn and were able to to complete
        our “Escape the Resistance” workshop within the allotted time.

        Our final test of our “Escape the Resistance” workshop was performed at the local High School: Davinci College. Here, we taught a large group of final year high school students about the possibilities of synthetic biology, and the dangers of
        antibiotic resistance. It was interesting to learn that most students were not that worried about antibiotic resistance, even though they were already aware of the problem. They stated their main reason for this was because they couldn’t do
        anything about it. Therefore, we were happy to learn them how any member of society can help tackle the antibiotic resistance crisis through better handling of our current antibiotics.

        The Leiden Science Family Day was a fun opportunity to let faculty members and other local families to teach their children about science. We gladly took this chance to teach children about the fun things you can do using bacteria. This was
        shown to them by allowing them to draw with colourful bacteria. Additionally, we took this opportunity to talk to parents about antibiotic resistance, and the threat it poses to our future. Particularly these parents were eager to learn
        about the issue of resistance as their children would grow up in this world. Therefore, they were also glad to learn all the ways they can help prevent the spread of resistance, by using antibiotics responsibly.
