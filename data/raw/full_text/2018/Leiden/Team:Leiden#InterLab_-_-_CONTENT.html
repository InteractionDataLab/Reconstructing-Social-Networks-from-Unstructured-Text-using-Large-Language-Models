      InterLab is an iGEM initiative aiming to reduce lab-to-lab variability. This years goal is to normalise fluorescence data to absolute cell counts or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD. As one of many iGEM teams we participated in this
      study and
      measured six different GFP expressing E. coli strains, along with a positive and negative control.
    </P><H1> Calibration </H1><P>
      In order to normalise the fluorescence of GFP in cell measurements, three calibrations were performed. All experiments, including the calibrations, were performed in four replicates. First of all, an OD<SUB>600</SUB> reference was determined
      to
      convert the measured absorbance at 600 nm (Abs<SUB>600</SUB>) into a comparable OD<SUB>600</SUB> value, such as generally obtained from a spectrophotometer. To that end the Abs<SUB>600</SUB> of both water and a LUDOX CL-X solution (45%
      colloidal
      silica suspension) was measured. From these measurements, a conversion factor of 3.679 was obtained between the Abs<SUB>600</SUB> and OD<SUB>600</SUB>. The next step is a calibration to convert the obtained absorbance at 600 nm to an estimated
      number
      of cells. By measuring samples with different concentrations of monodisperse silica microspheres, a calibration curve was made (Figure 1). As the microspheres have similar size and optical characteristics as cells, this calibration can be used
      to
      estimate the cell count in samples.

        properties as cells.</P></DIV><P>
      Next, the fluorescence measurement of cells expressing GFP was normalised to the fluorescence of Fluorescein, a fluorescent molecule with a similar excitation and emission profile. A calibration curve for the fluorescence of Fluorescein was
      made (Figure
      2) and used to normalise the fluorescence measurements from cells expressing GFP.

The devices have a pSB1C3 backbone and contain promoters, with different expression levels,
      coupled
      to a GFP gene (BBa_E0040). More information about the devices and controls can be found on their respective pages in the iGEM BioBrick Registry:

      Transformants were kindly provided by the iGEM team of <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TUDelft" target="_blank">Delft</A>. The Abs<SUB>600</SUB> was measured from an overnight culture of these transformants, which were subsequently diluted
      to
      an Abs<SUB>600</SUB> of 0.02. The Abs<SUB>600</SUB> and fluorescence (excitation 485 nm, emission 525 nm, 20 nm bandwidth, gain = 58) were measured from samples at 0 and 6 hours after inoculation. Measurements were performed in 96 well plates
      in
      a plate reader (TECAN Spark 10M).
    </P><H1>CFU count</H1><P>
      In order to determine the amount of colony forming units (CFUs) per 0.1 OD<SUB>600</SUB>, overnight cultures of the positive (BBa_I20270) and negative control (BBa_R0040) were diluted to this OD and plated at different dilutions. A total of
      six
      dilutions to an OD of 0.1 were made per strain. After 20 hours plates with less than 300 colonies were counted and used to determine the final CFUs per OD<SUB>600</SUB> of 0.1.
    </P><H1>Conclusions</H1><P>
      Using the calibration curves and the fluorescence and absorbance measurement, the average Molecules of Equivalent Fluorescein (MEFL) per particle was calculated for each of the devices and controls (Figure 3).
    </P><DIV class="InterLabFigureBox"><P class="caption"><B>Figure 3</B> Expression of GFP in different E. coli constructs normalised to Molecules of Equivalent Fluorescein (MEFL) per particle. Two colonies of each respective transformations were tested with four independent
        replicates.</P></DIV><P>
      Device 1 showed the highest normalised fluorescence per particle, followed by device 4, 2 and the positive control. Lowest normalised fluorescence was seen in device 6, 3 and the negative control. Device 5 showed a remarkable difference
      between the two
      replicates (Figure 3). This was due to both a difference in absorbance and fluorescence measurement, amplified in the difference in MEFL/particle. The reason why both absorbance and fluorescence differed between replicates is unknown.The
      average CFUs were calculated using the dilution factor and the amount of colonies counted on the respective plates. Using these results, the average CFUs per OD<SUB>600</SUB> of 0.1 were found to be <SPAN class="grouped">3.5 × 10<SUP>7</SUP>± 2 ×
        10
        <SUP>7</SUP></SPAN> and <SPAN class="grouped">3.8 × 10<SUP>7</SUP>± 2 × 10<SUP>7</SUP></SPAN> for the negative and positive control respectively. As the average CFU count is very similar for both positive and negative
      controls,
      expression of GFP is not likely to impact viability of cells.
