Fifty Shades of Stress
Antibacterial resistance leads to thousands of deaths annually. Meanwhile, only a handful of new antibiotics have been found in the last three decades. Therefore iGEM Leiden 2018 is looking into designing an innovative and colourful screening platform                                                 to detect bacterial cell stress. The system will consist of multiple stress promoters that are combined with chromoproteins. This results in a bacterial strain that produces a specific colour when the                                                 bacteria                                                 experience a specific kind of stress. This way our system visualises which type of stress is experienced by the bacteria. With our system, we hope to
expand the current screening methods for antibiotics. Nowadays, potential new antibiotics are screened for by assessing the lethality of a compound for bacteria. However, compounds that cause                                                   stress to the                                                   bacteria, but do not kill them are overlooked. Our theory is that a cocktail of these stress inducing compounds can be deadly. By using such cocktails, we will expand the pool of potential                                                   antibiotics.                                                   Simultaneously this obstructs the development of antibiotic resistance, as becoming resistant to one specific antibiotic is easier than to a cocktail of stress-inducing compounds.
Design update
The last couple of  weeks we have launched two new pages on our Wiki. The Events page where you can stay up to date on all the events we have visited and read a small review. Besides                                                         the                                                         Events page we have also launched our Sponors page. If you are interested to see who makes our project possible, then this page is a must see. Want to see more of our Wiki?

Promotion
The past couple of weeks we have been filming for our first crowdfunding promotion. Working with the Media Department of Leiden University, we are sure the result will be amazing. In August                                                           our crowdfunding will be launched, so stay tuned for more updates!
Working in the lab
In order to start our lab work as efficiently as possible we have made sure that the lab and all the equipment are ready for us to get to work the coming weeks. The materials and disposables                                                           are on their way, the DNA-primers have been ordered and some early enthusiasts have prepared the first batches of competent cells. From the 9th of July until the end of August it will only be lab work, more lab work and even more labwork. Wish us luck!
Human Practices
 
Working in the field of Synthetic Biology comes with enormous responsibility. We feel the importance of thinking about the impact of our project on society. This is why we have planned to                                                           discuss                                                           our project with experts in the field of antibiotics. Besides the opinion of experts, we also find it important to make people aware of the problem that we are facing, which is antibiotic resistance.                                                           We try to attend as much events as possible and inform visitors in a fun way about synthetic biology and how we can use it in our battle against bacteria. Come visit us at one of our upcoming                                                           events                                                           and share your opinion on synthetic biology!
In the spotlight
The past month we have attended several events. Here we have been introducing the broader public to our project and to Synthetic Biology in general. To make the subject more comprehensible we                                                           have offered them the opportunity to draw with bacteria. This                                                           resulted in some very beautiful pictures. On the left  you can see some of the results from our visit to UTwente. Interested? Come visit us at one of our upcoming events.

Dear reader, thank you for subscribing to our monthly newsletter. Via this platform we will keep you up to date on our project: Fifty Shades of Stress!
Our first month in the lab
July was the first month working full time in the lab on our project: Fifty Shades of Stress. The first succesful transformations were performed and the the first results using                                                     the GFP-strains were obtained.
Our PCR experts Daphne and Mees succeeded in isolating the DNA from all the promoters we intend to use during our project. Daphne is also the current record                                                     holder within our team for using the most                                                     pipette tips. Together with Germaine, they finished the first transformations. Our own “Classy” Jazzy explored the dangerous world of Streptomyces together with Marijke. Despite a few really smelly                                                     infections,                                                     Jazzy finished the first overlay to test our bacteria. Lotte has become an expert in pouring agar plates in the first few weeks, while Maaike performed the first attempt to synthesize a                                                     megaplasmid,                                                     unfortunately without success. Our programming manager Chiel, has set his computer aside for two weeks to focus on the Interlab studies, a necessity to win a gold medal in the competition this                                                     year.                                                     Like the true team manager she is, Charlotte was able to set us up with some Bacillus plasmids from iGEM Groningen. While the plasmids were transported from Groningen to Leiden, Laurens was busy                                                     trying                                                     to let E. coli produce colours and Carli and Tim set the record for the longest measurement, using the FACS-machine for over four hours. Each activity was carefully supervised by our                                                     Science                                                     manager, Marjolein, who lies awake at night to think about all the problems we could not fix ourselves.

European iGEM MeetUp
From July 20 to 22 five of our team members went to the iGEM European meet-up in Munich to meet 35 other European iGEM teams. The Munich team organized a                                                           lot of interesting and educational lectures                                                           and workshops. We also discussed our project with the other teams and learned about their projects during the poster presentations. Beside all the educational activities, of course we also                                                           did                                                           some sightseeing in the beautiful city center of Munich.

Werfpop
On the 8th of July we organised “Drawing with bacteria” at Werfpop, a free music and art festival in Leiden. We were invited by Science meets Business to                                                   organise a workshop involving some crazy                                                   science. We decided to do some bacterial painting with coloured bacteria. Werfpop visitors used cotton sticks to scrape some bacteria from the petri dishes we brought and drew on a small plate.                                                   Although                                                   nothing was visible while painting, the drawings magically appeared after three days as the bacteria had grown. We were really impressed by all the amazing works of art people made! The workshop was                                                   a                                                   great success with both young and old participating. Besides the drawing we also explained our project to anyone who was interested. It was great to hear all the different opinions everyone had on                                                   genetic                                                   modification and antibiotic resistance. We had many great discussions with the Werfpop visitors and look forward to all the events to come!

Dear reader, welcome to the crowdfunding special of our newsletter series. In this edition we will tell you all about our crowdfunding campaign and how you can help in                                                     the fight against                                                     antibiotic resistance: Say YES to stress!

Say Yes to Stress
Bacteria that make us ill are very clever. Through natural evolution, they constantly develop new strategies to arm themselves against our antibiotics. These resistant bacteria put all of                                                     mankind at risk. In order to ensure humanity’s future                                                     health, we must develop new strategies to deal with bacterial infections.
To combat these resistant bacteria we need new antibiotics, but scientists have been unable to discover new marketable ones. To tackle this problem, we came up with an innovative                                                     approach:                                                     bacteria that can show us what kind of stress they are experiencing by changing colour. Stressful substances are not deadly to bacteria by themselves, however, the right combination                                                     can result                                                     in a lethal cocktail. Our ‘stress bacteria’ will enable us to identify substances that can enhance the effect of existing medicines or create entirely new ones. This means we can outsmart the                                                     resistant bacteria.
With your support we want to tackle the global issue of antibiotic resistance, take home the grand prize in Boston and put Leiden University on the map as a world-class university. Our                                                     project                                                     is part of ongoing research within the university and will be continued when we achieve promising results, even if we do not win in Boston.
Our project requires funding to buy lab materials,                                                     chemicals, and a lot of DNA. You can decide to what extent you want to support us in the battle against antibiotic resistance. Pick the colour of stress you want to expose resistant                                                     bacteria                                                     to and together we will defeat them. In short, say yes to stress!

Dear reader, thank you for subscribing to our monthly newsletter. Via this platform we will keep you up to date on our project: Fifty Shades of Stress!
Our progress in the lab!
August already marked our last month of full time lab work in our ‘own’ lab, so we made the most of it.
Maaike and Lotte were able to amplify the SoxS stress-signal - which responds to DNA damage - by fusing multiple SoxS-GFP combinations together. Consequently, Tim and Carli, our validation team,                                                     confirmed that all these strains worked, and at a much higher                                                     efficiency than our previous singular SoxS-GFP strains. Additionally, Laurens made progress on enhancing the GFP signal using a different system called: T7, while helping others in the lab as our                                                     interim-Science manager.
On the other side of the lab, Jazzy and Marijke were able to freeze dry bacteria and revive them successfully, thereby enabling safer transport and storage of our bacteria.
This brings us closer to our goal of creating a safe and easy to use application for testing bacterial stress. Meanwhile, Daphne finished her project (to produce 32 stress detecting strains) by                                                     isolating                                                     7 new stress promoters and coupling them to GFP. These                                                     new constructs will be tested for their stress detecting capacity in the upcoming month.
This week, we are getting used to our new lab and office environments and setting up the systems for sequencing all our newly made parts. We have also made an extensive planning for our final two                                                     months                                                     until the wiki freeze, coming up on the 17th of october.                                                     With this planning we intend to acquire a golden medal in Boston, and win the grand prize!

Result of a disk diffusion experiment with a constitutive (always on) blue chromoprotein on the right. On the left the negative control, so a                                                     strain that contains no chromoprotein, and in the middle                                                     a lesser succesful strain is visible. Our next task is getting a blue colour only when stressed.
Disk diffusion for dummies:
Disk diffusion is a method that can be used to easily determine whether a compound is lethal to bacteria. To do this, small discs containing                                                     a potential antibiotic are placed on growing bacteria.                                                     The compound in the disc will then slowly spread out. If the compound is lethal to these bacteria, a “halo” will form around the disc where bacteria can not grow.
Dutch iGEM Meet-Up: BBQ and PubQuiz
On the 17th of August iGEM Leiden hosted a meet-up and BBQ for all Dutch iGEM teams. We were happy to see representatives from all 6 teams attend our                                                     meeting. During the barbecue itself, our chef Chiel made sure all food was seasoned deliciously and cooked to perfection. We also prepared a pub quiz about the Dutch iGEM projects, to allow                                                     everyone to familiarize themselves with eachothers projects. The winners                                                     of the pubquiz were iGEM Delft and iGEM Eindhoven, they took home the grand prize (some delicious candy!).

Sponsors!
This month we would like to give a special mention to our major sponsors: Medical                                                       Delta and Sarstedt . Medical Delta supports cooperation in Life Sciences, Health & Technology in Leiden, Delft and Rotterdam. Within the three Universities of these cities they are                                                   represented by YOUNG Medical                                                   Delta. Sarstedt is a                                                   distributor of disposable                                                   lab material. They were kind enough to provide us with enough disposables for our project and even paid a visit to our lab.

EL CID
Every year Leiden welcomes thousands of new first year students during its introduction week in August, the EL CID. This week is filled with fun activities, allowing                                                     the new students                                                     to get to know each other, the city and the university. This year the EL CID hosted their very first EL CID symposium and iGEM Leiden was there! We informed students visiting the symposium about                                                     our project and invited them to draw with coloured bacteria.                                                     Moreover, we tested our newly developed “Escape Room board game”! In this game, the students were faced with a problem: drug resistant bacteria. In order to find the cure, the students had to solve                                                     four minigames in time. We received lots of great feedback,                                                     which will allow us to make the game even more fun and educational.

Wiki Update
With the interlab study finished Chiel, our Programming Manager, could - in theory - dedicate all his time to programming the wiki.
In practice - of course - this was not the case, as the preparations for the iGEM barbecue, the EL CID and the launch of our crowdfunding campaign took a lot of time as well. Still, we managed to                                                   publish                                                   three new pages: The featured page, the newsletter page                                                   and the crowdfunding page. Furthermore, the team page received an extensive update. It is now possible to learn more about each of our team members by clicking on their picture.
The crowdfunding page took a lot of time, particularly to incorporate some cool features. The page started out as a countdown to the start of our crowdfunding campaign and automatically changed to a                                                   'Click-here-to-donate' page when our campaign launched. On                                                   desktops, a very soothing animation of rising circles complements the DONATE-button. Programming this seamingly simple animation took great effort!
With the start of our crowdfunding campaign, the crowdfunding page (on our wiki) was in need of another update, including the Hall of Fame for our donors. In this Hall of Fame, the rising circles                                                   return                                                   once again, even more glorious this time. All donors are                                                   given their own circle floating across the page. It took more than a week to get this concept to a working web page. Make sure to check this page out (on a desktop) and don’t forget to donate if you also                                                   want a personal floating circle on this page!

In the SPOTLIGHT
During the EL CID Symposium we had multiple teams participating in our self-made Escape Room. The goal of an Escape Room is to solve the puzzles as fast as possible and escape to freedom                                                           before the                                                           timer runs out. This of course enabled us to pick a winner!                                                           The team that was fasted to escape the drug resistant bacteria and thus find a cure was composed of Maxim van Delft and Daan Roossien, well done!

iGEM Leiden 2018
Dear reader, welcome to the October issue of the iGEM Leiden newsletter. This newsletter will be the last one before we go to Boston to present our project at the Giant Jamboree (24-28 October). For                                                   updates during the Jamboree please check out our social media! Enjoy the reading.
Our last month in the lab!
September has been a rather exciting month for the team. The initial goals of our research phase                                                     went according to schedule. We had successfully produced                                                     our bacterial strains in the previous months, which meant that this month we could focus more on completing the loose ends of the project and we started the analytical phase. Unfortunately, we also                                                     had                                                     to move out of our ‘own’ lab this month. Now we share                                                     a new lab space with multiple PhD researchers, who are kind enough to share their space with us.
In the lab, we mostly focussed on creating evidence and demonstrations of our product for the Jamboree at the end of October.                                                     Furthermore, our strains that contain handcrafted plasmids                                                     (small pieces of DNA that are separated from chromosomal DNA) were isolated this month and sequenced. DNA sequencing is the process of determining the precise order of the bases of our                                                     plasmids.                                                     This process is done by a company in Amsterdam.
The results are send to us by email during the night and we can verify our plasmids the next morning. It is mandatory to sequence                                                     our DNA before submitting it to iGEM. We have produced                                                     many different strains of bacteria that all need to be tested before the submission deadline. Charlotte and Marjolein were mostly responsible for these verifications.  
Tim and Carli were in charge of testing the bacterial strains with different types of stress, to                                                     check the responsiveness and effectiveness. We have found at least 6 strains that showed interesting results. Lastly, Jazzy made beautiful agar plates which demonstrated the potency of our project (see picture below). The dark line around the clear                                                     circles are                                                     bacteria that produce a “blue/grey” chromoprotein in                                                     response to DNA damage, proving that our project works!

The picture shows a plate containing our growing "stress bacteria". The three white discs contain antibiotics, which can be seen from the                                                     lack of                                                     growth in the surrounding circle. On the edge of that                                                     circle you can see a dark color. Those are bacteria that are producing a grey/blue chromoprotein in response to stress caused by a low antibiotic concentration!
Disk diffusion for dummies:
Disk diffusion is a method that can be used to easily determine whether a compound is lethal to bacteria. To do this, small discs containing                                                     a                                                     potential antibiotic are placed on growing bacteria.                                                     The compound in the disc will then slowly spread out. If the compound is lethal to these bacteria, a “halo” will form around the disc where bacteria can not grow.
Night of Discoveries 
During the week of 10 - 16 september we had the honour of organising a workshop for the Night of                                                     Discoveries (formerly known as the “Nacht van kunst en                                                     kennis”). We provided people with the opportunity to create their own bacterial drawings and play our renewed "Escape Room"-game, while learning something about antibiotic resistance on the way. We                                                     explained our project to everyone who was interested, and                                                     fortunately many people were. It was great to be part of such a big event! We loved the experience and hope that the next iGEM team will also be able to participate.

Crowdfunding
Our crowdfunding campaign: "Say YES to Stress!" received a major boost during the month of September. Thanks to all our amazing donors, we have                                                             reached over 80% of our total goal, which equals an amount of €7.820. The crowdfunding will end on October 6th during the Family Day of the Science Faculty at Leiden University. So, please                                                             help                                                             us reach 100% by choosing your colour and saying YES to stress!

Opening of the Academic year!
On the fourth of September we had the pleasure to attend the ceremonial opening of the academic year at the Faculty of Science. We                                                     were welcomed by the dean Geert de Snoo, were entertained                                                     by a fascinating lecture on ecotoxicology and enjoyed a musical intermezzo. Afterwards we were of course present at the drinks to promote our project and our crowdfunding campaign! We even quickly                                                     met up                                                     with Ionica Smeets, an endorser of our project and known                                                     from TV and radio.

Wiki Update
Calm before the storm… The deadline for the wiki freeze is approaching fast. Although it seems as if not much has happened with                                                     the wiki, behind the scenes a lot of work has been done.                                                     The past month a template for all our major pages has been programmed, so that the final text can be easily inserted when ready. For navigation purposes these templates also include an                                                     automatically                                                     generated quick-navigation, soft-links and even a few custom                                                     designed icons. As soon as the text is done for a page, it will be - in theory - just a case of copy and paste and all will be done. Let’s hope the iGEM servers will not give in under the pressure                                                     of                                                     over 300 teams uploading files at the same time…
