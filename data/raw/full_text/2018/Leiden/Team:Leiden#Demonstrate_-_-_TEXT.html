Demonstration
Antibiotic discovery is in sore need of innovation. Current antibiotic screening focuses on detecting lethal antimicrobial compounds. This leads to many non-lethal - but stressful - compounds being missed by conventional testing. Therefore,         we         propose a novel method for antibiotic screening that allows stressful compounds to be detected as well. Compounds that cause stress could be used in synergistic combination therapies that will delay the onset of antibiotic resistance.         Additionally, our method allows detection of non-lethal concentrations of lethal compounds. With our system we hope to drive the antibiotic discovery field forward by enabling easy detection of bacterial cell stress. To this end, we have         developed two frameworks for the detection of stressful compounds to be used in the lab by antibiotic researchers in academics and industry.
Bacterial cell stress visualised for the naked eye
Bacterial overlays are typically performed using Streptomyces or other antibiotic producing bacterial colonies. To perform an overlay experiment, an agar plate is dotted with colonies of a (pathogenic) organism of interest. These           antibiotic producing colonies secrete compounds that are damaging to the surrounding cells, creating a so called ‘death halo’ around the colony. This halo indicates a bactericidal activity of the producing colony. Afterwards the secreted           compounds that caused the halo are isolated and analysed for their structure and possible mechanism of action. Many of our current-day antibiotics have been discovered using these techniques. However, this process can be very time           consuming. For this reason, we have created a reporter strain in E. coli DH5α using chromoproteins coupled to stress activated promoters. When these E. coli cells are applied to an agar plate with an antibiotics           producing colony, they           will produce a color when being stressed. This not only indicates a mechanism of action for these antibiotics early in the discovery process - in the form of a specific chromoprotein colour produced by a specific stress promoter - but           also allows us to detect stressful but not necessarily deadly compounds and non-lethal concentrations of lethal compounds.
For demonstration purposes, we have replicated these bacterial overlays using a traditional disk diffusion           assay. Disk diffusion assays encompass antibiotic disks being placed on test organism saturated agar plates. These disks release the antibiotic slowly creating death halos around the disk (Figure 1). Thus, they are very similar in function           to bacterial overlays and provide an excellent replacement for demonstration purposes.
Figure 1.Disk diffusion on an E. coli saturated Mueller-Hinton agar plate with four nalidixic acid disks
In order to test our colourful bacterial strains, we saturated a Mueller-Hinton agar plate with pSoxS-AmilCP ( BBa_K2610033 ) transformed E. coli DH5α - one of our stress response elements, capable of detecting DNA damage. A disk containing nalidixic acid, an antibiotic which selectively and reversibly blocks DNA replication, was placed on the pSoxS-AmilCP ( BBa_K2610033 ) expressing bacteria. Figure 2 shows an example of such a disk diffusion. Around the disk - visible in white - the death halo is apparent, additionally, at the edge of the halo the E. coli bacteria are coloured blueish grey. This shows that as a result of the upregulation of pSoxS in these cells, AmilCP is being produced. This is indicative of a stressful process occurring in these cells. Hereby, we have shown           that           non-lethal concentrations of nalidixic acid can be detected using disk diffusion with our chromoproteins stress reporter BioBricks.

GFP based stress detection system responds selectively to antibiotics
Our system is designed to selectively respond to antibiotics based on their cellular targets, while not responding to other antibiotics targeting other cellular targets. This allows for early estimations about the mechanism of           action of candidate compounds, thereby shortening drug discovery pipelines. Some of the BioBricks we demonstrated this objective with, are pCspA-GFP ( BBa_K2610037 ),           pKatG-GFP ( BBa_K2610018 ) and pSoxS-GFP ( BBa_K2610031 ),           using flow cytometry. Cells were stressed by a repertoire of known antibiotics at non-lethal concentrations, in order to obtain their unique response profiles, such as can be seen in figure 3A, B and C for pCspA, pSoxS and pKatG           respectively. Promoter CspA is suppressed by nearly all antibiotics, but is activated specifically by nalidixic acid. In contrast to pCspA, promoter SoxS is not only activated by nalidixic acid but also by zeocin (both associated with DNA           damage). Conversely, promoter KatG           is activated only by hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, we have shown that our stress activated promoters react only to specific stressors. This is vitally important for our screening system because it allows for differentiation between modes           of actions of candidate compounds.
Figure 3 Specificity of stress response The pCspA-GFP ( BBa_K2610037 ),             pKatG-GFP ( BBa_K2610018 ) and pSoxS-GFP ( BBa_K2610031 )             were incubated with 12 stressors. Each BioBrick displays a different response pattern showcasing the specificity of our system.
GFP based stress detection reveals mode of action and enhances antibiotics.
Combination therapies have been proven to suppress the development of resistance in cancer and HIV treatment[1][2]. Moreover, synergistic combination therapies for fighting infections are already being used in the clinic in the           form of           amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. During our research we have proven that a non-lethal stressful compound verified by our system could be used to enhance the effect of antibiotics. We screened a number of natural and chemically engineered           compounds for their ability to stress bacterial cells, in this case E. coli DH5α. Firstly, compounds that were lethal were eliminated from the screen to ensure results from our system were in response to purely stressful           compounds (Figure 4).           Consequently, we continued with a select number of compounds due to time restraints. The following compounds were selected through literature research: ginger, ascorbic acid, cinnamon and cannabis[3-8]. We tested the ability of           these compounds           to activate or suppress various stress-related promoters fused to GFP using flow cytometry.
Figure 4. Experimental design of our system demonstration
The clpB promoter ( BBa_K2610020 ), a gene involved in the cellular stress response to aggregated proteins, responded to ascorbic acid, more commonly           known as vitamin C (Figure 5). This is an indication that this compound is involved in protein aggregation. Previous research has shown an involvement of ascorbic acid in the inactivation of proteins[9][10]. This suggests our           screening           system can indicate a possible mechanism of action for stressful compounds.
Figure 5. pClpB responds to ascorbic acid with an increased fluorescent response
Ascorbic acid not only emerged as a stressful substance but we also demonstrated that this compound could lower the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ampicillin, chloramphenicol and nalidixic acid (Figure           6). You can read further about these experiments on our Results page This set of experiments proves our system           is able to detect stressful compounds which can be used in antibiotic combination therapies.
Figure 6. Addition of ascorbic acid dramatically reduces MIC values of selected antibiotics. The MIC values of ampicillin, chloramphenicol and nalidixic acid were determined with             and without the addition of ascorbic acid (5 mg/mL).
