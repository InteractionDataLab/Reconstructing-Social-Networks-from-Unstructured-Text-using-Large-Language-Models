        Antibiotic discovery is in sore need of innovation. Current antibiotic screening focuses on detecting lethal antimicrobial compounds. This leads to many non-lethal - but stressful - compounds being missed by conventional testing. Therefore,
        we
        propose a novel method for antibiotic screening that allows stressful compounds to be detected as well. Compounds that cause stress could be used in synergistic combination therapies that will delay the onset of antibiotic resistance.
        Additionally, our method allows detection of non-lethal concentrations of lethal compounds. With our system we hope to drive the antibiotic discovery field forward by enabling easy detection of bacterial cell stress. To this end, we have
        developed two frameworks for the detection of stressful compounds to be used in the lab by antibiotic researchers in academics and industry.
      </P></DIV><SECTION class="popout chapter"><DIV class="collapsible"> Bacterial cell stress visualised for the naked eye </DIV><DIV class="collapsibleContent"><P>Bacterial overlays are typically performed using <I>Streptomyces</I> or other antibiotic producing bacterial colonies. To perform an overlay experiment, an agar plate is dotted with colonies of a (pathogenic) organism of interest. These
          antibiotic producing colonies secrete compounds that are damaging to the surrounding cells, creating a so called ‘death halo’ around the colony. This halo indicates a bactericidal activity of the producing colony. Afterwards the secreted
          compounds that caused the halo are isolated and analysed for their structure and possible mechanism of action. Many of our current-day antibiotics have been discovered using these techniques. However, this process can be very time
          consuming. For this reason, we have created a reporter strain in <I>E. coli </I> DH5α using chromoproteins coupled to stress activated promoters. When these <I>E. coli</I> cells are applied to an agar plate with an antibiotics
          producing colony, they
          will produce a color when being stressed. This not only indicates a mechanism of action for these antibiotics early in the discovery process - in the form of a specific chromoprotein colour produced by a specific stress promoter - but
          also allows us to detect stressful but not necessarily deadly compounds and non-lethal concentrations of lethal compounds. For demonstration purposes, we have replicated these bacterial overlays using a traditional disk diffusion
          assay. Disk diffusion assays encompass antibiotic disks being placed on test organism saturated agar plates. These disks release the antibiotic slowly creating death halos around the disk (Figure 1). Thus, they are very similar in function
          to bacterial overlays and provide an excellent replacement for demonstration purposes. </P><FIGURE class="resultfig horizontal"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 1.Disk diffusion on an <I>E. coli</I> saturated Mueller-Hinton agar plate with four nalidixic acid disks</B></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>
          In order to test our colourful bacterial strains, we saturated a Mueller-Hinton agar plate with pSoxS-AmilCP (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2610033" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">BBa_K2610033</A>) transformed <I>E. coli</I>
          DH5α - one of our stress response elements, capable of detecting DNA damage. A disk containing nalidixic acid, an antibiotic which selectively and reversibly blocks DNA replication, was placed on the pSoxS-AmilCP (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2610033" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">BBa_K2610033</A>) expressing bacteria. Figure 2 shows an example of such a disk diffusion. Around the disk - visible in white - the death halo is apparent, additionally, at the edge of the halo the
          <I>E. coli</I> bacteria are coloured blueish grey. This shows that as a result of the upregulation of pSoxS in these cells, AmilCP is being produced. This is indicative of a stressful process occurring in these cells. Hereby, we have shown
          that
          non-lethal concentrations of nalidixic acid can be detected using disk diffusion with our chromoproteins stress reporter BioBricks.

This allows for early estimations about the mechanism of
          action of candidate compounds, thereby shortening drug discovery pipelines. Some of the BioBricks we demonstrated this objective with, are pCspA-GFP (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2610037" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">BBa_K2610037</A>),
          pKatG-GFP (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2610018" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">BBa_K2610018</A>) and pSoxS-GFP (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2610031" class="colouredlink" target="_blank">BBa_K2610031</A>),
          using flow cytometry. Cells were stressed by a repertoire of known antibiotics at non-lethal concentrations, in order to obtain their unique response profiles, such as can be seen in figure 3A, B and C for pCspA, pSoxS and pKatG
          respectively. Promoter CspA is suppressed by nearly all antibiotics, but is activated specifically by nalidixic acid. In contrast to pCspA, promoter SoxS is not only activated by nalidixic acid but also by zeocin (both associated with DNA
          damage). Conversely, promoter KatG
          is activated only by hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, we have shown that our stress activated promoters react only to specific stressors. This is vitally important for our screening system because it allows for differentiation between modes
          of actions of candidate compounds.

Moreover, synergistic combination therapies for fighting infections are already being used in the clinic in the

          compounds for their ability to stress bacterial cells, in this case <I>E. coli</I> DH5α. Firstly, compounds that were lethal were eliminated from the screen to ensure results from our system were in response to purely stressful
          compounds (Figure 4).
          Consequently, we continued with a select number of compounds due to time restraints. The following compounds were selected through literature research: ginger, ascorbic acid, cinnamon and cannabis<SUP>[3-8]</SUP>. We tested the ability of
          these compounds
          to activate or suppress various stress-related promoters fused to GFP using flow cytometry. </P><FIGURE class="resultfig horizontal"><FIGCAPTION class="center"><B>Figure 4.

          known as vitamin C (Figure 5). This is an indication that this compound is involved in protein aggregation. Previous research has shown an involvement of ascorbic acid in the inactivation of proteins<SUP>[9][10]</SUP>. This suggests our
