Parts Overview
Our team contributed 7 parts to the registry: 6 basic and 1 composite. One of the basic parts was our chassis, FCP2-01 (part BBa_K2633000 ). Our composite part is a restriction-legal version of the fusion-protein expressing plasmid used to transformed FCP2-01 and inoculated into plants. Our other 5 basic parts make up this composite part.
