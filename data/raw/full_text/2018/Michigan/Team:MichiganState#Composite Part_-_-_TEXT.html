BBa_K2633000 proB + RBS + Pseudomonas acdS+ linker + GFPmut3b + term FCP2-01
This part is used to constitutively express a fusion protein of Pseudomonas sp. acdS and eGFP. Our team transformed a restriction-illegal version of this part into FCP2-01 and inoculated Brachypodium distachyon, a model grass species, with this transformed bacteria. We observed colonization of roots with this bacteria up to 4 weeks after inoculation.
