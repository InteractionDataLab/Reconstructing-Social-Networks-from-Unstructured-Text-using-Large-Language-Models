His research utilizes functional genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics to probe central signaling pathways underlying eukaryotic cell growth and function. In particular, Dr. Kumar’s work addresses a fundamental process wherein yeast cells undergo a dramatic change from a unicellular to a filamentous growth form. This growth transition is a critical determinant of fungal pathogenicity and also provides an excellent model regulatory network with relevance to ERK/MAPK signaling.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><H2 class="teamname">Dany Lewin</H2><H4>Graduate Advisor</H4><P class="personDescription">I am a senior at the University of Michigan, studying Cell and Molecular Biology and Biomedical Engineering.
