The Team
Matthew Fischer
President
I am a senior majoring in Cellular and Molecular Biology. I am interesting in pursuing an MD with a focus on transitional medicine, bench to bedside clinical work. I believe that research can take us to new heights in the medical field. I am currently researching epigenetics in the Pathology Department of the Medical Campus.
Thomas Stewart
Science Director
I am a biomedical engineering student with an interest in protein engineering and the use of proteins as theapuetics to help treat diseases. Currently, my research is focused on computational protein design and validation for the Zhang Lab within the department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics. I hope to pursue a PhD in biochemistry and one day make drugs that improve the lives of others.
Caleb Kaczmarek
Finance and Wiki Director
I am a senior at the Univeristy of Michigan studying Cellular and Molecular Biology with minors in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology and Computer Science. After graduation, I hope to enter graduate school to research genetics and develop gene therapy technologies.
Annabelle St. Pierre
Human Practice Director
I am a junior at the Univeristy of Michigan studying Biomedical Engineering with a concentration in biochemistry. I plan on obtaining a Masters degree in BME and using my knowledge to advance medical devices and/or pharmaceutical drugs.
Sam Bower
Member
I am an Ecology, Evolution, and Biodiversity major at the University of Michigan. I value the diversity of ideas that stem from this team and the ways it challenges me to think on a different scale then I do in my usual studies. I am passionate about the environment and the conservation of biological diversity. For these reasons I have goals of attending law school in the future with a focus on environmental law.
Yongzhen Chen
Member
I am a rising junior in pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Michigan. My research experiences include pharmacokinetics in the Department of clinical pharmacy and blood disorders with zebrafish in the Department of Pediatrics. I love traveling and photography.
Paulina Czarnecki
Member
I am a sophomore planning on double majoring in Mathematics and Neuroscience. I do research in a Biophysics lab under Dr. Zochowski, studying neural networks computationally and experimentally. I hope to pursue a PhD. On the rare occasion I'm not busy with academics, I enjoy running, or playing the piano.
Jaewon Heo
Member
I am a rising senior studying Biochemistry at U of M. My current research involves the design and testing of Cas9 protein inhibitors, as well as the characterization and functional studies of PAM sequence mutants. I believe that student-led research such as ours is an effective way to become involved in the scientific community and explore the value of collaborative science. After graduation, I plan to pursue further study in biochemistry and molecular biology at graduate school.
Rachel Lee
Member
I am a junior at the University of Michigan, studying Cell and Molecular Biology and Psychology. I plan on pursuing a medical degree after graduation in hopes to advance the medical field, especially for children cancer research and clinical applications. I am also interested in developing sustainable energy to decrease the amount of carbon output.
Anna Mychalowych
Member
I am a rising junior studying Cellular and Molecular Biology. I am also working towards my honors thesis in the Kumar Lab. I am interested in knowing how Ksp1 affects translation and cell survival in response to stress. Currently, I am studying the relationship between Ksp1 and Cdc33, one of the initiation factors in Baker’s yeast. After college, I hope to enter graduate school to pursue a PhD in the biological field.
Akira Nishii
Human Practice (External) Director
I am a senior at the University of Michigan studying Chemical Engineering and Cell and Molecular Biology. I am studying the effect of temperature on lipid desaturation in adipocytes in the MacDougald lab.
Shaunak Puri
Member
I am a sophomore at the Univeristy of Michigan studying Biomedical Engineering with a concentration in biochemistry. I am also pursuing minors in Business and Biology. I hope to attend law school after graduation and to enter into the field of biotechnology patent law.
Marcus Ammerlaan
Faculty Advisor
Marc Ammerlaan is a lecturer in the Program in Biology. He is in charge of labs and graduate student instructors for the department's introductory courses. Along with the introductory biology office staff, Ammerlaan handles course administration (grades, regrades, and make-ups).  He has been an adviser to Michigan's iGEM team since 2010.
Anuj Kumar
Faculty Advisor
Dr. Kumar is a Professor in the department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology.  His research utilizes functional genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics to probe central signaling pathways underlying eukaryotic cell growth and function. In particular, Dr. Kumar’s work addresses a fundamental process wherein yeast cells undergo a dramatic change from a unicellular to a filamentous growth form. This growth transition is a critical determinant of fungal pathogenicity and also provides an excellent model regulatory network with relevance to ERK/MAPK signaling.
Dany Lewin
Graduate Advisor
I am a senior at the University of Michigan, studying Cell and Molecular Biology and Biomedical Engineering. I will be obtaining a master's in Biomedical Engineering next year. I do research on molecular imaging of breast cancer signaling events using fluorescence microscopy of various kinds. After graduation I hope to work in development at a biotechnology company and return to grad school for a Ph.D.
Aaron Renberg
Graduate Advisor
I am a graduate advisor working towards a M.S.E. in Biomedical Engineering. I have previous research experience interning at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD and at Children’s National Medical Center’s genetic medicine department in Washington, D.C. When a micropipet isn’t in my hand, it's usually replaced by a hockey stick or a fencing foil.
