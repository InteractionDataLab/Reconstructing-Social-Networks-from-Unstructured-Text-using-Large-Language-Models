Collaborations
Midwest iGEM Conference
Michigan State University hosted a small conference for nearby iGEM teams on July 1, 2018. Five teams, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, University of Iowa, Carroll High School, Michigan State University, and our team, attended and each team presented their project design and their plans moving forward. We gave and received feedback regarding design components and potential experiments moving forward.
Rose-Hulman Institute
Following the Midwest iGEM Conference, we reached out to the team from the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology about a potential collaboration. Over a Skype video call, we discussed the current status of our projects and the role that each of our teams could play in helping the other. They were willing to read a few papers that we intended on using as a basis for our mathematical models and suggested two different routes that we could focus on. We provided feedback on their wiki, giving tips and suggestions to make the information more clear and accessible to others. While both of these were relatively simple tasks, they went a long way toward helping us each accomplish our goals.
