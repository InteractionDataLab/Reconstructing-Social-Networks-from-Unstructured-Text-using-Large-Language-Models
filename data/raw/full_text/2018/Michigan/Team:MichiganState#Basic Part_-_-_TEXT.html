Basic Parts
BBa_K2633006 Enterobacter ludwigii FCP2-01
This part was our projectâ€™s chassis. It provides an organism to the repository with novel traits, as an engineerable generalistic endophytic bacteria of grasses. Its transformation and stable maintenance of green fluorescent protein after 4 weeks in plant roots demonstrates its usefulness to the repository.
BBa_K2633001-BBa_K2633005
These basic parts make up the composite part BBa_K2633000 , which constitutively express a fusion protein of Pseudomonas sp. acdS and eGFP.
