Impression 5 Science Center
In order to educate children about synthetic biology and get them excited about science, we held an outreach event at Impression 5, a science center in Lansing, Michigan on June 29, 2018. The event started with a brief introduction to our team and what synthetic biology is. Then, in efforts to entertain the children, we hosted some hands on activities. These were organized into separate stations. Some of the stations consisted of practicing pipetting, extracting DNA from strawberries, constructing an alien with randomized selection, and colored leaf imprints. Over 50 children participated in the event. Our main goal in collaboration with Impression 5 was to teach children more about science and how it may be applicable to their interests and future careers.
East Lansing Public Library & Capital Area Public Library
Using Impression 5’s event as a model, we also reached out to the East Lansing Public Library and the Lansing Public Library. The East Lansing Public Library’s event took place on July 13th 2018 in East Lansing and the Lansing Capital Area Public Library’s event was held in the Lansing on the 26th of July. Both of these featured the activities previously mentioned from Impression 5 (practicing pipetting, extracting DNA from strawberries, constructing an alien with randomized selection, and colored leaf imprints).
Mid-Sure Presentation
We attended a poster presentation at the Mid-Michigan Symposium for Undergraduate Research Experiences held at Michigan State University, discussing our project with attendees and exploring projects designed by students from across the area.
