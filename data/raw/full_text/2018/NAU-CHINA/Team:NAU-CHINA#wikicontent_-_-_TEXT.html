Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team
if our institution teaches an iGEM or synthetic biology class and when we started our project:
Does our institution teach an iGEM or synthetic biology course?
When did we start this course?
Are the syllabus and course materials freely available online?
When did we start our brainstorming?
When did we start in the lab?
When did we start working on  our project?

parts\刘逸珩,葛吉涛
parts overview
Adding parts to the registry
describe and define a part
provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more
send the DNA sample before the Jamboree：在ddl前送至金斯瑞
link1 link2 link3
information needed on registry:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
basic parts
all the basic parts
NOT put characterization information on this page
Best Basic Part Special Prize: only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize(of course the best one)
composite parts
all the composite parts
NOT put characterization information on this page
Best Composite Part Special Prize: only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize
part collection
improve
For teams seeking to improve upon a previous part or project
Include all part measurement and characterization data on the part page on the Regisrty. Include a link to  improved part on this page.(Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part. The original part must NOT be from part number range. If you change the original part sequence, you must submit a new part. In addition, both the new and original part pages must reference each other. )

safety\韦思齐
write about how we are addressing any safety issues in our project
write about whatever safety topics are most interesting in our project (do not need to copy our safety forms onto this wiki page)
Safe Project Design (project safety features, certain decisions about the design to reduce risks, etc)
Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis
Choosing parts that will not harm humans / animals / plants
Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experiment
Including an "induced lethality" or "kill-switch" device
......
Safe Lab Work
Safety procedures used every day in the lab
Did we perform any unusual experiments, or face any unusual safety issues?
Safe Shipment
Did we face any safety problems in sending our DNA parts to the Registry?
How did we solve those problems?
