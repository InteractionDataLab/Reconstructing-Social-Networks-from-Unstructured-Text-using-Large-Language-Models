Our Best Composite Part:BBa_K2557010
TetO-miniCMV promoter-Bxb1(BBa_K2557010) is composed of TetO(BBa_K2557038), miniCMV promoter(BBa_K2557032) and Bxb1 recombinase(BBa_K2557001). It is regulated by TetR and can express Bxb1 recombinase to open the expression of RFP. Bxb1 attB-RFP-Bxb1 attP(BBa_K2557002) consist of Bxb1 attB(BBa_K2557041), tagRFP(BBa_K2557035) and Bxb1 attP(BBa_K2557042), functioning as reporting part. miniCMV promoter-Bxb1-RDF(BBa_K2557019) is composed of miniCMV promoter(BBa_K2557032) and Bxb1-RDF(BBa_K2557047), which expresses Bxb1-RDF fusion protein to block the expression of RFP. TetO-miniCMV promoter-Bxb1(BBa_K2557010), miniCMV promoter-Bxb1-RDF(BBa_K2557019) and Bxb1 attB-RFP-Bxb1 attP(BBa_K2557002), three of them ensure the uniqueness of downstream output.
