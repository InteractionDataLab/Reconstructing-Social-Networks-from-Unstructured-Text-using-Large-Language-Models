Transient transfection of Jurkat T cells
1. Culturing of cells before nucleofection. Cells should be nucleofected after reaching 70-85% confluency, higher cell densities may cause lower nucleofection efficiencies, mycoplasma contamination will negatively influence experiments results.
2. Combine the cells of interest, DNA and the appropriate cell-type specific Nucleofection Solution (Here Buffer C), and transfer to an amaxa certified cuvette (invitrogen cuvette). 1X106-5-106 cells, 1-5 μg plasmid DNA in 1-5 μL H2O or TE, and 100 μL room temperature Buffer are used in this step. The quality and the concentration of DNA used for nucleofection plays a central role for the efficiency of gene transfer. We strongly recommend the use of high quality products for plasmid purification like Qiagen endofree plasmid kit. The purified DNA should be resuspended in deionised water or TE buffer with a concentration between 1-5 μg/μL. The ration of A260;A280 should be at least 1.8 for nucleofection.
3. Insert the cuvette into the Nucleofector TM and choose the cell-type specific program. Press the start button "X". If the program is unknown, please following the recommend above. To avoid damage to the cells remove the sample from the cuvette immediately after the program has finished (display showing "OK").
4. Rinse the cuvette with culture medium and transfer the cells into the culture dish.
5. Incubate at 37 °C until use.

Add the same amount of 10 % DMEM culture solution to stop the digestion. Transfer the cell suspension to a 1.5 mL EP tube and centrifuged at 1000 rpm/min for 5 min using a centrifuge. Suck and discard the supernatant , and add 600 μL PBS to resuspend the cells. Use 380 μL of them for WB.

6. Add loading buffer (5% SDS) to supernatant by volume ratio of 1:4 (50 mL/200 mL) then boil at 100 ℃ for around 5-10 minutes.
Running the gel
1. Wash glass plates and spacers.
2. Place rubber seal in bottom of gel kit.
3. Put the spacers in between the two pieces of glass, making sure they are level.
4. Add the clamps and plugs.
5. Dispense the separation gel. Shake well immediately after adding TEMED to fill the gel. When filling the gel, 5 mL of gel can be sucked out along the glass by the gun, and the gel surface can be raised to a height of 1 cm under the rubber comb. Then add a layer of ethanol to the gel, and the gelation after liquid sealing is faster.
6. placed at room temperature for 30 min (20 min in summer) to be solidified, when there is a line of refraction between ethanol and gel, the gel has been condensed. When the gel is fully solidified, the upper layer of ethanol can be poured off and the ethanol is blotted dry with absorbent paper.
7. Dispense 5% concentrated gel. Immediately after adding TEMED, the mixture can be filled. Fill the remaining space with the concentrated gel and insert the comb into the concentrate. When filling the gel, the gel should also flow down along the glass plate to avoid bubbles in the gel. Keep the comb level when inserting the comb. Since the volume shrinks and shrinks when the gel solidifies, the loading volume of the sample hole is reduced, so the gel is often applied on both sides during the solidification process of the concentrated gel. After the gel has solidified, pinch the sides of the comb and pull them straight up.
8. Make up running buffer (1 in 10 dilution of stock). Need around a liter.
9. Remove comb and place gel in opposite side of apparatus.
10. load samples and molecular weight markers. 20-30 μg of total protein from cell lysate.
11. Put on grey plastic top (make sure rubber seal is in place).
12. Add the plugs.
13. Slowly add running buffer.
14. Put on front plastic cover and run at 70 V for around 30 minutes. After the sample reaches the concentrated gel, run at 120v for 1 hour.
Note: The gel percentage required is dependent on the size of your protein of interest:

Transferring the protein from the gel to the membrane
1. Need 6 pieces of filter paper (11 x 14.5 cm) and 1 piece of Hybond-P PVDF membrane of the same size.
2. Hydrate Hybond-P by placing in methanol for 3 minutes and in transfer buffer for 10 min.
3. Remove gel from electrophoresis apparatus and cut to size.
4. Place gel in transfer buffer for 10 min.
5. Assemble the transfer cassette as follows (black side down): fiber pad (pre-wet in transfer buffer), filter paper (x3, pre-wet), gel (no bubbles), Hybond-P PVDF membrane (non bubbles), filter paper (x3, pre-wet) and fiber pad (pre-wet).
6. Place cassette in transfer cell (black on black).
7. Add transfer buffer to the electrophoresis tank.

9. Remove membrance and, if necessary, keep hydrated in TBS in the cold room until needed.
Blocking and Antibody staining and Development
1. Block the membrane for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C using blocking buffer(5% skim milk powder).
2. Incubate the membrane with appropriate dilutions of primary antibody in blocking buffer. We recommend overnight incubation at 4 °C.
3. Wash the membrane in three washes of TBST, 5 min each.
4. Incubate the membrane with the recommended dilution of conjugated secondary antibody in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h.
5. Wash the membrane in three washes of TBST, 5 min each.

Gel Extraction
According to the E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction kit:
1.Perform agarose gel/ethidium bromide electrophoresis to fractionate DNA fragments. Any type or grade of agarose may be used. However, it is strongly recommended that fresh TAE buffer or TBE buffer be used as running buffer. Do not reuse running buffer as its pH will increase and reduce yields.
2.When adequate separation of bands has occurred, carefully excise the DNA fragment of interest using a wide, clean, sharp scalpel. Minimize the size of the gel slice by removing extra agarose.
3.Determine the appropriate volume of the gel slice by weighing it in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Assuming a density of 1 g/mL, the volume of gel is derived as follows: a gel slice of mass 0.3 g will have a volume of 0.3 mL.
4.  Add 1 volume Binding Buffer (XP2).
5.Incubate at 50-60 °C for 7 minutes or until the gel has completely melted. Vortex or shake the tube every 2-3 minutes.
6.Insert a HiBind® DNA Mini Column in a 2 mL Collection Tube.
7.Add no more than 700 μL DNA/agarose solution from Step 5 to the HiBind® DNA Mini Column. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 minute at room temperature. Discard the ltrate and reuse collection tube.
8.Repeat Steps 7 until all of the sample has been transferred to the column.

CloneExpress
According to the CloneExpress Multis One Step Cloning Kit:
1).Preparation for the linearized cloning vectors；
Select appropriate cloning sites, and linearize the cloning vector.The cloning vectors can be linearized by restriction digesting with endonuclease or by reverse PCR amplification.
2).Design of PCR primers of the insertions；
The principle for the design of ClonExpress® MultiS primers is: introduce homologous sequences (15 bp～20 bp)into 5’ end of primers, aiming to making the ends of amplified insertions and linearized cloning vector identical to the ends of their neighbours which is required for recombination reaction.
3).PCR amplification of the insertions；
Insertions can be amplified by any polymerase (Taq DNA polymerase or other high-Fidelity polymerases),but to prevent mutations introduced during PCR, high-Fidelity polymerases is highly recommended.
4).Recombination reaction；
Set up the following reaction on ice. Spin briefly to bring the sample to the bottom before reacting.
