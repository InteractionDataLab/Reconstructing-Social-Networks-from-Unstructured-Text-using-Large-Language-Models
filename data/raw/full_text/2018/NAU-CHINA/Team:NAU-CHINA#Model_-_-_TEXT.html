Introduction
We propose post-integration conditions, rationally simplify the complex situation, and split the whole process into a series of chemical reactions. Assuming that intervals between two reactions obey exponential distribution, we use the Gillespie algorithm[1] to calculate the changes in various substances in the system with reference to the Dynamics of the Brusselator [2]. The ideas and methods of this model have strong promotion prospects and adaptability. Our model demonstrates the necessity of using the recombinase(rec) system，the improvement effect of the system after adding the pathways expressing RDF-inhibitor and rec-inhibitor in turn, and the robustness of the model .The experimental team verified some assumptions and results of the model and selected materials according to the parameters of the model.
For judging handbook
What kind of modeling is being done and what information it will provide?
We use the Gillespie algorithm to calculate the changes in various substances in the system
What assumptions were made and why?
One of our assumptions is that the length of the interval between consecutive reactions obeys an exponential distribution so that we can use the Gillespie algorithm [1] to calculate the changes in various substances in the system.
What kind of data was used to build/assess the model
(a) Expression rate of each gene (production rate of related proteins, consumption rate of each protein.
(b) The computing coefficient of each reaction’s rate.
How the model results affected the project design and development?
Our model shows the improvement effect of the system after adding the pathways expressing RDF-inhibitor and rec-inhibitor in turn, so as to provide guidance to the experimental team.
1.  How impressive is the modeling?
Our model has successfully done a proof of concept and played a key role in guiding experimental direction and path design.
2.  Did the model help the team understand a part, device, or system?
Of course we did
3.   Did the team use measurements of a part, device, or system to develop the model?
The experimental group verifies the feasibility of the path step by step and roughly determines the parameter dimensions of the model.
4.  Does the modeling approach provide a good example for others?
The ideas and methods of this model have strong promotion prospects and adaptability. The codes are showed on our wiki , you can copy and run in you Matlab convenient.

Tips: Click the button named Aim.
1. Normal protein expression is a reaction which satisfies the post-integration conditions. All reactions which satisfy post-integration conditions can be viewed as one single chemical reaction. part1 . Aim>>To simplify calculation
2. Different reactions in cells occur independently. Aim>>To determine when the next reaction occurs and which reaction occurs.
3. The length of the interval between consecutive reactions obeys an exponential distribution. Aim>>To determine when the next reaction occurs and which reaction occurs.
4. The degradation of protein can be viewed as linear degradation. Aim>>To simplified calculation，this model is also compatible with other methods of calculating degradation for example Michaelis-Menten equation.
5. The repressor effect of the protein can be described by the Hill equation. Aim>>To calculate the expression of rec.
