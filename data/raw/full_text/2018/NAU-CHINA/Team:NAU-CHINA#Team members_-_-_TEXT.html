Yaxuan Wu
A preson who loves freedom,
likes unrestrained, close to nature,
likes extreme sports,
also likes to stand on top of the world looking down on the earth.
Yes! This person is me,
the captain of the iGEM team,
responsible for planning and scheduling,
and occasionally doing a few small experiments.
And I am from
the College of Life Sciences of
Nanjing Agricultural University.
Jitao Ge
When I was very young,
I liked to explore the mysteries of nature.
After I went to college,
I fell in love with life sciences.
I told myself that this is what you want.
Therefore, I have participated in many research activities.
This time I participated in iGEM,
I gained science, friendship and enthusiasm.

I am studying at College of Veterinary Medical
of Nanjing Agricultural University.
My major is veterinary medicine.
I love sports, thinking and music，
especially good at basketball and table tennis.
In the iGEM team NAU-CHINA,
I am mainly responsible for the functional verification
about TetO/R system and cell experiments in the project.
The longer you get along with me,
the more you will find the charm of me.
Yuan Yu
Hello, everyone.
My name is Yuan Yu.
My teammate often call me YY.
I like travelling but no opportunity.
I love reading but no time.
When can I have free time?
That is a question.
After a long period of exploration,
I find that working, working, working,
no lazy, no slack off and no delay,
then I will have time to do what I want to do.
Now, let me see, what else have I not done?
