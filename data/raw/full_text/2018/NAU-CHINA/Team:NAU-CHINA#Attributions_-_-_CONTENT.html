Their help and support for us to make our project a success.</P><H1>Team members </H1><P>As the caption of NAU-CHINA 2018, main rsponsibilities of<B> Yaxuan Wu </B>are to design the project, experiments and interact with other iGEM teams. He also do some experiments. He preside over the bi-weekly group meeting, and check the team members' work at the meeting, and issue new tasks.</P><P><B>Jitao Ge</B> participated in the construction of the syn-Notch transgenic plasmid and completed the design, registration, construction and sample submission of parts. He also participated in the completion of Safety Form, Human practice, notebook recording and wiki writing.  </P><P><B>Yuan Yu</B> constructed plasmids in upstream circuit and did cell experiments to examine the effect of our system.</P><P><B>Sheng Xu</B>
                designed most cloning strategies including the system of Recombinases and Recombinases with RDF .He also assisted in interlab.
            </P><P><B>Chunfeng Wang</B> constructed a portion of plasmids about the recombinase and recombinases with RDF , as well as three parts. She is also responsible for the pronuclear verification of recombinase.</P><P><B>Chengzhu Fang</B> constructed plasmids, checked the problems in the laboratory, did experiments on cells, and participated in interlab study.</P><P><B>Peikai Li</B> assisted with simple experimental operations and participated in the human practice activities. He also built a mathematical model to simulate the feasibility and stability of the path. By using different algorithms for calculation, he got the results.</P><P><B>Yifei Ren</B> was responsible for human practice and wet lab. He planned the work arrangement of the whole human practice work, organized the popular science propaganda, interviews with researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, interviews on citizens, campus lectures, and training in synthetic biology in high schools.  He also constructed a plasmid which can be used to verify the function of RDF.</P><P><B>Zelan Huang</B> was mainly responsible for HP's various matters, and continuously carried out related activities and information collection, and timely gave feedback to the subject. </P><P><B>Jiangyuan Liu</B> is responsible for subject crossing: removing the barrier between experiments and modeling.Wiki master.
