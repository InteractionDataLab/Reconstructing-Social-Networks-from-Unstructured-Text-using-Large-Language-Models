CloneExpress
According to the CloneExpress Mtis One Step Cloning Kit 1).Preparation for the pnearized cloning vectors； Select appropriate cloning sites, and pnearize the cloning vector.The cloning vectors can be pnearized by restriction digesting with endonuclease or by reverse PCR amppfication.  2).Design of PCR primers of the insertions； The principle for the design of ClonExpress® MtiS primers is: introduce homologous sequences (15 bp～20 bp)into 5’ end of primers, aiming to making the ends of amppfied insertions and pnearized cloning vector identical to the ends of their neighbours which is required for recombination reaction.  3).PCR amppfication of the insertions； Insertions can be amppfied by any polymerase (Taq DNA polymerase or other high-fidepty polymerases),but to prevent mutations introduced during PCR, high-fidepty polymerases is highly recommended. 4).Recombination reaction； Set up the following reaction on ice. Spin briefly to bring the sample to the bottom before reacting.
