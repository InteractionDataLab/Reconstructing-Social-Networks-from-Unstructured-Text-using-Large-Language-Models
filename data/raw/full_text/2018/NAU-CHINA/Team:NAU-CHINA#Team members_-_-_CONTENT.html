                    When I was very young,
                    I liked to explore the mysteries of nature. 
                    After I went to college,
                    I fell in love with life sciences. 
                    I told myself that this is what you want.
                    Therefore, I have participated in many research activities.
                    This time I participated in iGEM,
                    I gained science, friendship and enthusiasm.

                    My name is Yuan Yu.
                    My teammate often call me YY.
                    I like travelling but no opportunity.
                    I love reading but no time.
                    When can I have free time? 
                    That is a question.
                    After a long period of exploration, 
                    I find that working, working, working, 
                    no lazy, no slack off and no delay,
                    then I will have time to do what I want to do.
                    Now, let me see, what else have I not done?
