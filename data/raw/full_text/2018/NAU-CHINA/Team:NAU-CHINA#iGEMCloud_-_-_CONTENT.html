APP:IGEM CLOUD(android platform)</H2><H3>Why we want create it:</H3><P>Regarding the planning of this HP-related event, we have conceived a more unique idea - the development and production of iGEM's exclusive app.</P><H3>Information source is too scattered:</H3><P>At present, all the information about iGEM in China's participating regions comes from: QQ group, WeChat group, Post bar, Zhihu, iGEM official website, etc. The information about the events that these platforms can get is more scattered and in a certain The timeliness, authenticity, and referability of the information obtained on these platforms are not guaranteed.Here are some troubles we have now:
  
 

1. Information mess:
The above-mentioned platforms have more participants, some of them are current and former teams or instructors, but there are also some groups that have little to do with the competition, which leads to the confusion of the entire source of information. As a result, the information that you want to obtain cannot be found effectively and targetedly.

1.	Low interactivity：
Everyone lacks a platform to share resources. There are many teams in these platforms who want to acquire or purchase some resources, such as: a certain bacteria, a genetic sequence, etc. Some people want to contact some participating school teams; others will consult, for example, how to cultivate a certain bacteria; There will also be some teams that will post some of the relevant conference events they hold, etc., and invite other teams to participate. This reflects a problem, you need a reliable and specific platform to obtain or publish resources. This platform needs to be centralized and specific, and there is a need to simplify the various steps involved.

2.	Experience is difficult to record and pass on：
Getting information about the events of the past is cumbersome. Due to the official website setting of iGEM, the official website of the corresponding year can only be registered if it is registered, so that it is known that the entire detailed information of the participating teams in the same year and the characteristics of the team's topic are somewhat different. What are the disadvantages? What are the shortcomings? What can provide experience for future teams?

3.	Barriers to exchanges between countries or teams: 
It is difficult for domestic teams to communicate with foreign teams. Many foreign websites or social platforms, domestic landing registration is more troublesome, and because of the different resources of each participating team, many teams rarely have the opportunity to exchange and learn with foreign teams, it is difficult to achieve a more international innovation.

Those are reasons why we create this application--IGEM CLOUD,which is hoped to be a information gathering platform that receives the latest information from IGEM, a micro-blog that allows all users to participate in discussions in the form of individuals or teams, and a community that built for IGEMers all around the world.</P><H3>How does it work?</H3><P>The outlook of the app:
    

1. The name of this application is IGEM Cloud, the application is based on Android platform, and supports versions above Android5.0.register an account with your email address.
Register/login：
   

2. In the application, you can receive official news, notifications, etc., so that you can get the latest news of IGEM events in a timely, convenient and accurate manner.
  
3. Users can post blog posts in the discussion forum for all users to browse. The blog post is in the form of pictures + text. The blog posts are classified into different sections, such as experiment, life, etc., so that you can share your matches with all IGEM participants. Experience outside the game. Good blog posts will be tagged so that they are discovered by users.
   
4. At the same time, users who see the blog post written by you can comment or reply to you. The content of the reply is in the form of image + text.
  

5. If you want to remind specific users to view the content you posted, you can remind the user to view this blog post or comment by &quot;@&quot; + &quot;user nickname&quot;.
 
6. When you find a very good blog post, click on the star symbol in the upper right to bookmark it for later reading.
 
7. You can search for blog posts in one or more keywords in the app, and sort the search results by time, number of view , and collection. You can also search for users or teams.
  
  
8.You can follow the teams or users that you think are worthy of attention so that you can view their published content more easily in the future.
  
9. Each user can create or join a team, become a member, and use their team space, the team creator is the captain. The captain can edit the team information in the team space to introduce others to the team and show the team research direction.
10. Only members of the team can post in the team space, but everyone can view it, the captain can also add albums in the team space, members of the team can post photos in the album.
    
11. This app has built-in gadgets that may be needed for the lab.
12. More other features will be added in the future.......</P><H3>Imagination of this app:</H3><P>The App we conceived can be similar to domestic knowledge, small red books, etc., can provide comprehensive information on the release of events, each team to register their own team home page, various activities related to iGEM, question answer and experience sharing , topic discussion, experimental supplies, and more.
1. Publish event information: Be able to update all notifications and news about iGEM in a timely manner.
2. Registration of each participating team: Each participating team can have its own space. In this space, the team's dynamics can be released at any time. Whether it is experience, event photos, troubles, etc., the members of this shared space are members of this team. This space is a space shared by them. At the same time, other teams can come to visit. The advantage of this space is to reserve resource information for future teams, and to create an environment for the participating teams to share memories. This team registration will be updated year by year, which can be grouped by year or team name, which can facilitate future players to communicate with previous players. At the same time, other teams can also communicate more easily with the team they are looking for through this app. and they can choose the communication objects they want to find.
3. Related activities: For example, this year's Taiwan exchange meeting was organized by ZTE University in Taiwan. They distributed information to the QQ group, but as the number of chats increased and new members joined, the news gradually Being overwhelmed, it needs constant updates, it is very troublesome. This app can provide an event publishing platform for all teams similar to this, and can perform dynamic page flipping of the event on the homepage, and for those who want to know the latest activities, specials can also click directly to the event. &quot;This function bar performs conditional screening and selects satisfactory activities to participate.&quot; Of course, the team that organizes the event can choose to send invitations and other forms of event notification invitations so that they expect the invited team to be informed in a timely manner.
4. Questions and Answers:You can ask questions and even invite designated people to answer them. Of course, others can also discuss them. You can also post a topic on the latest iGEM related issues, discuss it, and more. 
5. Purchase of experimental related supplies and other resources: A platfrom where information is organized so that you can purchase the necessary supplies for the relevant experiments. You may contact some related biotech companies in the later stage to provide them with platform-related experimental products. Sale. Or you can buy some of the strains, sequences, etc. that the team is selling. (provided that it is legal and capable of responding to biosafety)
Some of the current basic functional concepts are above, and improvements and innovations can be made later.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
