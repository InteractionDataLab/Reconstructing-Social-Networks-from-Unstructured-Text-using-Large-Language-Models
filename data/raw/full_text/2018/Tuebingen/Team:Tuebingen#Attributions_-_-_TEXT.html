General Support
Hubert Kalbacher
We would like to thank our PI Hubert Kalbacher who helped us out so much in planning and carrying out the toxicity assay, the MALDI-TOF Measurements and also the protein purification. Furthermore he provided us with lots of laboratory equipment and the materials we needed for the protein purification. Thank you very much!
Leonard Kaysser
We would like to thank our PI Leonard Kaysser for his extensive support in this year's project. If any problems occurred he was always there to help and advise us. He also gave us important tips for the Boston presentation. Thanks a lot for this great year!
Michael Jendrusch
Michael Jendrusch is a very experienced iGEMer, who helped us out a lot in time management, thinking about a great storyline for our project and planning our wiki. Thank you for traveling to Tübingen in your spare time to share your experience and advice with us!
Student Council of Biochemistry
Many thanks also go to the student council of Biochemistry, who provided us with money on loan to register for this years iGEM competition.
Lukas Radwan
Lukas Radwan supported us in designing our project and was always there in if we needed advice on how to implement the ideas that we had. Thank you very much!
Project Support and Advice
Thomas Binz
Also, we would like to thank Thomas Binz, a brilliant scientist working on clostridial neurotoxins, who supported us very much in planning and implementing our toxicity assay and who consulted with us, that we would perform everything correctly. Thank you!
Lab Support
Especially in our lab work, we experienced an enormous amount of support by so many different people, which we would like to thank very much in the next section.
Heide Lab Members
We thank the Heide Lab and all team members for providing us with a laboratory to work in where we performed most of our molecular biology work and supporting us with a huge amount of materials we needed for our work. Furthermore, the team members were always happy to give us advice in all sorts of questions reaching from help with Gibson cloning or PCRs to the usage of the different devices in the lab. A big thank you goes to Tobias Raichle. He is the “Gibson God” in the lab. Tobias always was happy to share his knowledge and experience about Gibson assembly with us. Furthermore, he helped us to screen the errors and to optimize our workflow. With his support, we were able to finally achieve positive results. Franziska Wiker and Nils Hauck supported us in the area of protein expression. They gave us an overlook and performed with us a small workflow to test our expression system. Although both, Franziska and Nils, were occupied with their doctoral thesis, they spent their time and nerves to help us. For all other questions about lab work and theory, Tomke Bakker knows the answer. She answered all questions and shared her experience with a lot of calm. A thank you goes to all other members from the Heide Lab: Felix Wolf, Alicia Engelbrecht, Simon Schäfermann, Marius Bader and Alexandra Bauling. They all supported us with their advice, support, and experience.
Lerche Lab Members
We would also like to thank the Lerche Lab, especially Heidi Löffler, who provided us with the SHSY5Y cells and Eslicarbazepine while also giving advice on how to culture and differentiate these cells properly.
Stehle Lab Members
We would like to thank Prof. Dr. Thilo Stehle and his Lab Members who provided us with financial support and also supplied us with materials and the technical support.
Schwarzer Lab Members
The Schwarzer Lab provided us with many devices, advice, and materials that were needed for the different detection methods. Thank you very much for your support!
Feil Lab Members
The Feil Lab team provided us with many different materials media and also with the mT/mG MEF cells. Also, we received plasmids (pcDNA3.1(+), pcDNA3.1(-), pLacZ reporter plasmid) that we needed for our cloning experiments, which we would like to thank the Lab very much for. We would also thank the team for letting us use the autoclave. Furthermore, we are thankful that we received so much advice and support from the team members, whenever we had questions or needed help otherwise. Additionally, we want to thank Markus Wolters for providing beautiful fluorescent images of neurons which we could use to design our postcards.
Dodt Lab Members
We would very much like to thank the Dodt Lab for letting us use their fluorescence microscope and also for giving us an introduction in how to use it properly. Also, we are thankful for the materials that were provided and that they let us use the autoclave multiple times.
Rapaport Lab Members
The Rapaport lab members provided us with Pasteur pipette tips for our cell culture and let use their autoclave many times. Thank you very much!
Hailfinger Lab Members
We are very thankful that the working group Hailfinger provided us last minute with a plate reader for our InterLab study after we encountered several problems with the plate reader we were using before.
Garcia Lab Members
The Garcia Lab members supported us a lot in troubleshooting the InterLab study, which we are very thankful for!
Jansen Lab Members
We were supported by the Jansen Lab members, with storage room in the -80°C freezer for our cell culture, which we would like to thank them for!
Frank Essmann
Frank Essman provided us with storage room in the  -80°C freezer for our proteins. Thank you very much!
Elisabeth Fuss
Special thanks also go to Elisabeth Fuss, who took the responsibility in supervising us and our work in the lab. She was always there to support us with any kind of advice or materials we needed, which we would like to thank her for very much!
Klaus Möschel

Grond Lab Members
The Grond Lab Members supported us a lot with the analytics (MS and NMR) of our chemical experiments. Thank you very much for your time and patience! Here, we also want to thank Julian Schmid who dedicated lots of time, advice and measurement time in order to help us. We hope we didn't bother you to much! We would also like to thank Nadine Schilling of AK Grond for her support, advice and the measurement of our MALDI samples.
Maier Lab Members
We would like to thank the Maier working group, which provided us with a laboratory, where we could perform all our chemistry work. Furthermore, they also offered us lots of advice, especially Sibylle Riedel. The lab provided us with some basic chemicals, solvents and material. Thank you very much!

As a student of media studies, she gave us invaluable advice about how to present ourselves on social media and provided us with contacts for campus tv and Kupferblau. She showed us new possibilities on how to draw public attention to our project and gave general useful tips.
Service Learning Interview
We would like to say thank you to service learning with whom we filmed a video clip with an integrated interview about iGEM and our research among students.
24 Hour Lecture
The event was organized by the FSVV and we were lucky that we could hold a presentation and be part of it. Thank you very much!
Ract! Festival
On short notice, the Ract! team offered us a spot where we could present iGEM and our project to the visitors. Thank you for the great cooperation!
Public Debate
Without Streitkultur e.V. this event would have not been possible. Thank you for this collaboration and amazing evening!
Student Laboratory Day
A huge thank you Ms. Fuss who made this project possible and helped us with the organization so that we could offer the pupils an exciting day in the lab.
Prof. Dr. Selzer
Through Prof. Dr. Selzer, we made contact with Boehringer Ingelheim and have the chance to have a factory visit.
Boris Palmer
We are so proud that we had the chance to meet our mayor Boris Palmer and talk to him about our project and the topic of synbio in politics. Thanks a lot for this exciting opportunity.
Bioinformatics Support
Phillipp Thiel
Finally, we would like to thank Philipp Thiel who gave us a great amount of support in our bioinformatics work. First of all, he introduced us to structure elucidation of proteins and to homology modeling. Furthermore, he also introduced molecular dynamics simulations and the corresponding software (GROMACS) to us. We would also like to thank him for giving us access to a remote PC with two GPUs for our MD simulations. Lastly, he supported us with our interpretation of our generated results.
