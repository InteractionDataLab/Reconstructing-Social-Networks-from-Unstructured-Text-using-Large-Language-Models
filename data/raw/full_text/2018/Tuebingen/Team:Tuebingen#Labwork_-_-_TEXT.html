Labwork
Everybody's a mad scientist, and life is their lab. We're all trying to experiment to find a way to live, to solve problems, to fend off madness and chaos.- David Cronenberg
Introduction
BoNT C - Liscense to enter
As stated, we modified botulinum toxin in a way that lead to its detoxification.  This, as well as the coupling of our detoxified BoNT C to other substances were the main aspects of our lab work, next to our special cell culture to test our library on neuron-like cells. The whole process we went through and the different methods we used to achieve our goals are described below.
An other important part of every iGEM year is the InterLab Study, which is one of the Bronze-Medal Criteria.

Interlab
In this year, our team again decided to participate in the fifth international iGEM InterLab study, which aims to identify and correct the sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology measurements. The overall goal is that eventually, measurements taken in different labs will not underly the problems of variability due to different measurement environments or devices anymore, but will be reliable and comparable for all members of the science community.
The main question the InterLab Study 2018 tackeled was:
Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD?
