According to the problem we mentioned in the demonstration, the expression of the NicA2 protein may be toxic to
E. coli
so that its gene cannot be stably present in
E. coli.
Similarly, genes that are toxic to
E. coli
are difficult to achieve genetic manipulation in it, especially using replication-dependent recombination methods such as Red/ET homologous recombination. However, many proteins that are toxic to
E. coli
are normally present in
Pseudomonas
, and during the establishment of the
P.fluorescens pf-5
promoter library of
Pseudomonas fluorescens
, we found that most of the promoters of
P.fluorescens pf-5
cannot work in
E. coli.
Therefore, in addition to the transformation of
P.fluorescens pf-5
into a new chassis for heterologous expression, we are also interested in directly implementing genetic manipulation in
Pseudomonas
. The genetic manipulation of
Pseudomonas
was carried out earlier. The early genetic manipulation method was to use the homologous recombination of the endogenous RecA recombinase, but the efficiency was very low and it was prone to off target. In 2017, Zheng Wenzhao et al[1]. studied the construction of the
Pseudomonas
Red/ET recombination system and achieved preliminary results in
Pseudomonas putida
,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
,
Pseudomonas syringae
and
Pseudomonas fluorescens.
Regardless of the type of cloning, screening markers are indispensable, and our part BBa_K2569032 have improved one of the most widely used parts BBa_J04450 in iGEM. lacI is present on the genome of many host cells, which suggests that he normal expression of RFP requires the induction of IPTG and need 18 hours of waiting. We replaced the lac promoter in front of the RFP gene with the strong pf-5 promoter PampC. And hope that RFP, as a visible marker for the naked eye, can be expressed more pronouncedly and faster in
Pseudomonas fluorescens pf-5
.
