Overview
Our submitted parts include a promoter library of inner promoters with various strength built in
Pseudomonas fluorescence
-pf5. We also include well-characterized composite part. One includes our strongest promoter and nicotine oxidase NicA2, working well in  enhancing nicotine degradation compared to original nicA2 gene.
