Overview
Our submitted parts include a promoter library of inner promoters with various strength built in
Pseudomonas fluorescencepf-5
. We also include well-characterized composite part. One includes our strongest promoter and nicotine oxidase NicA2, working well in  enhanced nicotine degradation compared to original nicA2 gene.
Promoter Library
We are proud to submit a promoter library of inner promoters with various strength built in
P.fluorescencepf-5
. And these promoters belong to our basic parts. They are so lovely and good boys, which enable future iGEM teams to easily and predictably get protein production in
P.fluorescencepf-5
. Additionally, this promoter library will support future iGEM teams some help in exploration on
P.fluorescencepf-5
cells with high capacity in degrading.
We explored these promoters by measuring strength of firefly fluorescein, marked as “y” data.
According to friend teams’ collaboration datas and our analysing, we built a model to regularize and predict the strength of library members. You can learn about these members intuitively.
