General Support
PIs
Thanks to our PIs Prof. Youming Zhang, Prof. Jun Fu and Prof.Guijie Ren for helping us in optimizing our design as well as offering advice on lab techniques. They always give us constructive advice and help us during our brainstorm process like assessing the applicability and feasibility of our project.
Instructors
Doctoral candidate Li Zhen is the instructor of the wet lab experiments, he was supervising and profoundly shaping the wet lab experiments in certainly every project. All the time, He gave crucial advice in the conceptual situation and implementation of our experiments. It is him that organized our team, allocated resources and shaped our project with enormous expertise. He was keeping the general overview of our team and experiments, yet he landed a helping hand in human practice.
Doctoral candidate Jiang Chanjuan is also one of our experiment instructors who is kind and always teaches us with patience. From the beginning of our project, she provides us with much inspiration and guides our daily work.
Advisers
Graduate student Sun Tao has advised us in our experimental project design and daily lab work. He always kept a backup plan in his mind, if experiments would fail. He profoundly supported our efforts in experimental techniques and lab regulation. He is an easy going and warm-hearted person who always concerned about our daily life.
PhD candidate M.Nazeer Abbasi is the other adviser in our team. He is from Palestine and has been working in this lab for long years. He loves studying and working in China and talking with us, Chinese students. From the very beginning of our team, he organized seminars with us to help our undergraduates learn more about scientific study and develop our interest in life science.
