Panel Title
Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5(pf5) is the only safety bacteria using in Chinese agriculture approved by Ministry of agricultural and rural affair of China . Besides ,this strain has been confirmed to be non-pathogenic to mammals. Compared with E.coli, the developed organisms , the toolkit for Pseudomonas fluorescens seems not exploit well. We are going to build a promoter library of inner promoters with various strength in pf5. We characterize the strength by a ﬂuorescent reporter gene, firefly. An additional vector is that We hope to engineer our bacteria with the nicotine degradation gene cluster from Agrobacterium S33 into Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 by rec/ET recombination , so that Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 could degrade nicotine. These bacteria will be used to handle nicotine in cigarette butts or in the environment. At the same time, we would apply the promoter library to control nicotine degradation efficiency.
