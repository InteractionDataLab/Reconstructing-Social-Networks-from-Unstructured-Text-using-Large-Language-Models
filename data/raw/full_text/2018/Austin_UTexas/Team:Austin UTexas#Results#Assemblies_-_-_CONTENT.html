The same promoters, terminators, and origins of transfer are used within all assemblies. Each 1-5 bridge connector has a different reporter protein coding sequence making it easy to determine which plasmid each colony contains. Each plasmid also contains a unique Barcode, that is paired to a specific origin of replication. This design eliminates as many variables as possible, allowing the origin of replication to be the single largest factor determining whether the bacteria sustain and express the plasmid. </P><DIV class="floatright"><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Table 1.</B> The completed assembly plasmids along with their antibiotic resistance gene, origin of replication, reporter, and barcode.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><P>We currently have 8 completed assembly plasmids and continue to make more. Table 1 shows the completed assemblies along with which reporter gene, antibiotic resistance gene, origin of replication, and barcode is on the plasmid. All assemblies have the same origin of transfer, assembly connectors, promoter/RBS, and terminator.</P><H3> p15A Assembly Plasmid </H3><P><B>Our lab has created a total of eight assembly plasmids and are constantly working to add more to the kit.</B> Eventually each 1-5 bridge connector, with an assigned chromoprotein reporter and barcode, will be assigned to a specific origin of replication. We currently have created three 1-5 bridge connectors with the GFP, RCP, and E2C reporters. The plate shown below demonstrates in <I> E. coli</I> cells what a successful assembly plasmid transformation looks like with a GFP reporter. While a successfully created part-plasmid does not exhibit any chromoprotein, assembly plasmids do exhibit the chromoprotein from the 1-5 bridge connector part.</P><DIV class="floatright"><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 2.

It is normal to only see a few colony that are transformed with the assembly plasmid and express the chromoprotein</P><H3> Shuttle Vector Assembly</H3><DIV class="floatleft"><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 3.</B> BHR 925 Golden Gate Assembly
