Cyano Q&A
A lot of current iGEM teams work with cyanobacteria. These tiny green microorganisms require special cultivation methods which aren’t always common knowledge to everyone. We created this Cyano Q&A especially for iGEM Hamburg 2018 in order to solve the most prominent questions they had and also for other teams entering the world of cyanobacteria.
What are the culture conditions of cyanobacteria?
It depends on the strain. Typically Synechococcus elongatus sp 7942 and Synechocystis PCC 6803 - two model organisms - are incubated at 30°C (86°F). Moreover, as an autotrophic organism they need light in order to survive. We use light bulbs with a light intensity of 120 μE/m2·s . With those settings they have a growth rate of 0.052 h‐1. Optionally, you can use the light intensity of 60 μE/m2·s. With those adjustment the growth rate would be 0.026 h‐1.
