Register and attend
Thanks to the amazing support of our university, our friends and sponsors, our team was successfully registered and is looking forward to conclude an awesome year at the Giant Jamboree!
Deliverables
We created our own wiki and are excited for everyone to explore our work!
We are very proud of what we have achieved as a team and we are also happy to present everyone who attributed to our success!
We are looking forward to inspiring discussions at our poster during the Giant Jamboree!
We worked very hard on an exciting presentation and look forward to showing what we have achieved!
We have thoroughly discussed safety and security issues associated with our project and have documented the results in our Safety Form!
We documented all created and submitted parts and submitted DNA samples to the registry!
We have submitted the following parts .
Attribution
We are very thankful for all the support we experienced during the competition and are more than happy to mention everyone who attributed to our project and wiki!
Characterization / Contribution
We have successfully participated in the InterLab Measurement Study and submitted our data on time.
Silver
Validated Part / Validated Contribution
We characterized BBa_K2587024 .
This part was submitted to the iGEM registry and is validated.
Collaboration
We were delighted to meet other teams and collaborate in order to achieve our goals.
Human Practices
One of the most valuable experiences of the competition was sharing our project and acquired knowledge with the public . We highly enjoyed inspired conversations about ethical and societal aspects of synthetic biology, organizing our own lecture series , and starting a worldwide postcard campaign !
Gold
Integrated Human Practices
In addition to engaging with the public, we expanded our Human Practices by investigating both ethical and scientific issues, opportunities and limitations of our projects. Talking to experts from international laboratories, we were happy to integrate their valuable feedback into our lab work!
Improve a previous part or project
We are proud to improve an existing part (BBa_C0061) to a codon optimized version (BBa_K2587000).
Model your project
This year modeling plays a particular role in the iGEM teams´s Düsseldorf project. The aim of our model was to find the perfect ratio of different constituents of the co-culture, such as medium composition, ratio of different organisms or incubation setups.
Demonstrate your work
We were able to demonstrate the functionality of our concept under real world conditions.
