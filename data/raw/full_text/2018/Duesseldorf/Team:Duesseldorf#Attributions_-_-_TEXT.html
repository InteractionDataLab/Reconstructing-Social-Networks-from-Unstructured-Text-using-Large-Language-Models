Help and support
Principal Investigators
Jun. Prof. Dr. Ilka Axmann – Our primary PI
Thank you for any expertise we received when we suddenly stood in your office. Especially in the field of cyanobacteria your advice including sending three advisors from your team was a great help. Also thank you for your calm nature, your positive attitude, the help at each meeting, the talk at our lecture series and lending us almost all your flasks for our experiments.
Prof. Dr. Oliver Ebenhöh – Our secondary PI
Even though we did not always understand everything straight away, many thanks for the incredible and patiently given know-how in modeling. In addition to that, you were always accessible to us and gave us input in every meeting that influenced our project again and again.
Institute for Plant Cell and Biotechnology
Prof. Dr. Markus Pauly – Our hero
Thank you for providing us with not just an entire lab, all the consumables, and the expertise of you and the entire team, but also for the trust in us to let us work independently and allowing us all the freedoms we had.
Christiane Heil
Thank you for all organizational matters that were settled in a very short time and for all the lovely conversations during the breaks in the seminar room.
Barbara Schulten – Our Lab Angel
Thank you for the incredible support you have given us throughout the entire year. No matter what we needed, within a short time it was there. But most of all we thank you for every shared laugh together.
Ghizlan Bousejra
Our "new Barbara" - thanks for at least 1000 bottles of media you made for us while still having fun with us. You were also our counterpart for personal problems and listened to us when we needed someone to talk to and we are very grateful for that.
Katharina Lufen
For the technical know-how, the organization in the lab in case we wanted to block almost every lab device at once, and for unlocking our lab countless of times, when we did not have the keys in the morning yet again.
Felix Roth
Thanks for the patience and the expertise in all technical matters and the kind smiles.
Dr. Catalin Voiniciuc
Thank you so much for all your tips and tricks especially in the end of our project. It was a great help that you proof read some of our texts and gave us great input in how to phrase everything we want to mediate in a good scientific language.
Dr. Murali Dama
Thank you for all your expertise and always asking us if you are disturbing a meeting, when you want to use the coffee machine.
Dr. Balakumaran Chandrasekar
For all the help and protocols for our yeast cloning.
Dr. Merve Seven
For every expertise and sharing giggles at lunch and late nights in the lab.
Dr. Vicente Ramirez Garcia
Thanks for the expertise in sugar detection measurements. You always helped us immediately, no matter when.
Fabian Stritt
Thanks for the patience, the primer orders and the help in the daily lab routine.
Tim Niedzwetzki
For all the microscopy, your advice and every conversation during the breaks.
Advice
Prof. Dr. Lutz Schmitt

Melanie Voigt-Polzen
A team member by heart! We know it wasn’t always easy with us but thank you so, so much for not only being a true friend and giving us hope, but also for spending your weekends in the laboratory and your free time with driving us around. We’re sure that some members would have gone crazy without your understanding and support!
Brigitte Haumann
Thank you for everything you have organized for us this year. It is not always easy to consider all the wishes of a team and overcome all the bureaucratic hurdles, but you made it happen.
