Newsletter
A newsletter is a method to bring news to a big range of people, which is why we gave the scientists we worked with, our sponsors and other interested people the chance to sign up for a monthly newsletter early on. It is very important to us to have many people informed about every step we take in order to let them have a look at our evolving ideas, involve them in our experience and to keep interest in our project. Therefore, we decided to create an English version in addition to the version in our native language German, to be able to go international. In our newsletter we do not only describe scientific topics related to our project but also events outside the scientific realm. During the year we often had a lot of updates to share, which is why the newsletters were always in demand.  At first we introduced our topic with an abstract and included theoretical information our ideas are based on. Then, for each monthly report we summed up our improvements in the lab to give an overview of our progress. This was especially important for our professors: Not only were they able to observe the motivation in the team and improvement within the project over the time, but they were also able to react quickly and send us more advice in regards to information stated in the report.
Important conversations with our PIs and events such as trade fairs and meetups were also not neglected. But we also showed our subscribers the evolvement of our team. We included reports of our intense and fun team building weekend or BBQs together, how we got to know each other and more fun events.
