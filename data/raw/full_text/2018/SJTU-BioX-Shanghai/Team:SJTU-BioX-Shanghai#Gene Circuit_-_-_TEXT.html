Gene Circuit
Summary
Since the wet-lab has designed the circuits, it is natural for us to think of this question: how does the circuits work, or can we actually achieve the desired function in reality? And there are also many questions which we may find it not easy to answer: how does the amount of drug molecules produced and metabolized change? What will happen when we adjust the concentration of NO?
Furthermore, we also want to get to know about the logical relationship between the promoter, terminator, protein, inducer, and so on of the genetic circuits. And it is one of the most important things we concern about that whether the results obtained in the experiment consistent with those obtained in the simulation or not.
With these questions, we conducted simulation modeling for the genetic circuits. We hope to provide references for the selection of the wet-lab scheme by changes of the relative concentration of each factor in the simulated circuits, and further verify the correctness and feasibility of our circuits.
Procedure
We used the Simbiology toolbox in MATLAB for simulation.
Five genetic circuits were established, which were responsible for localization, imaging, drug synthesis and cell lysis. We also creatively combined localization and imaging circuits to save plasmids.
The modeling process is showed below. Since ARG2 works the same way as ARG1, we just show one model of them.
Establishing the ODE equations for each circuit and representing them as diagrams.

Results
By solving the ODE equations for simulation, we obtained the figures of the change of factor concentration over time in several circuits as shown below.
Analysis
It can be seen from the above simulation curves that all the target proteins we need can be successfully expressed, especially azurin protein is very sensitive to the promoter. So as long as the NO concentration is sufficient, azurin protein can be induced.
