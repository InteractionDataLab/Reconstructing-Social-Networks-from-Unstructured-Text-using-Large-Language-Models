Graphical Abstract
Highlights
Acoustic Reporter Genes
We successfully realize the expression and ultrasonic detection of acoustic reporter gene, and have performed specific identification of colorectal cancer through which.
T Peptide
We successfully construct an outer membrane peptide-displaying system that uses INP-tPEP and OmpA-tPEP to target T antigen expressed on the surface of cancerous cell.
ECHO Capsules and Hydrogel Beads
We successfully generate a bacterial loader that contains lyophilized engineered bacteria and enable its normal function in vivo.
