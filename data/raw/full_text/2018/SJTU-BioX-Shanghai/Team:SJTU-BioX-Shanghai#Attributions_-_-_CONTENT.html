Being the core of this project Zhang has been continuously giving new thoughts as well as advice on the project design throughout the season, and has carried out great improvement on our device.</P><H3>Biobricks </H3><P>Peixiang He, Zhihan Liang, Zhixiang Liu and Yirui Hong were mainly responsible for biobrick-related works in wet lab. They were capable of engineering unique bacteria that express exactly how we wanted them to. It is also their efforts on preparing engineered bacteria for further properties examination in cell and mouse experiments.</P><H3>Cell Experiments</H3><P>Cancer cell lines HT29 and normal epithelial cell lines HACAT were cultured by Yuncong Ran, Shiyu Sun, Ruoyu Xia and Shihao Bai to serve as the subjects for multiple short peptides adhesive property examinations. The examinations aimed to testify the specificity of antigen-antibody binding between our bacteria and different cell lines.
</P><H3>Mouse Experiments</H3><P>Mouse experiments are among the most important parts of our projects and they are mainly designed and performed by Shuyu Zheng and CHIA-YI HSIAO, including diseased mouse model induction as well as device testifying. 
</P><H3>Ultrasound imaging</H3><P>Ultrasound-related experiments were mainly designed and performed by Qingwei Fang. He also developed the Matlab code for ultrasound image processing job. And Shiyu Sun carried on doing this job when Qingwei was overwhelmed with the team wiki.</P><H3>MRI imaging</H3><P>Qingwei Fang recorded MRI imaging experiment and assisted in experiment design as well as data processing. And Kuan Yao helped with the record of the experiments while Qingwei being busy on wiki development.</P><H3>Modeling</H3><P>Shuyu Zheng, Shiyu Sun, Xin Zhang, Anyuan Tian and Yulin Liao did all the modeling work for our projects.
</P><H3>Human Practices</H3><P>Bozitao Zhong, Weiwen Wu, Kuan Yao and Shihao Bai were in charge of the human practices part. Bozitao Zhong was the leader of this part. Weiwen Wu brought up a lot of new ideas. Kuan Yao organized the exhibition and Shihao Bai helped with the research in Canada.
</P><H3>Art</H3><P>Our team’s logo, banner, posters, uniforms and the layout of our wiki were all designed by Weiwen Wu. She helped us to rank the second best poster in the fifth CCiC. Yuncong Ran also helped to design the posters exhibited in our 10th anniversary exhibition.
</P><H3>Wiki</H3><P>Our wiki were developed by all of us but Qingwei Fang and Yulin Liao construct the website’s frame for us in advance. Qingwei were in charge with communicating with the designer Weiwen and the development of wiki on computers while Yulin worked on the mobile web.
</P><H3>Presentation</H3><P>Hsiao Chia Yi is our presentation mastermind. She attended the Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference on behalf of our team. Later, she instructed the presentation on the fifth CCiC. Our last presentation on Giant Jamboree was also conducted by her. Her speech is really appealing and full of passion.
