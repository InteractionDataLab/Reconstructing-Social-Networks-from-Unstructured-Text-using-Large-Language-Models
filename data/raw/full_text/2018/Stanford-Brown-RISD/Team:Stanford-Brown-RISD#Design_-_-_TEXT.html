JUDGING FORM â‡—
The overall design of our team's project is interwoven across several different sections in our wiki. The Experiment page clearly outlines the steps and design processes that our team went through before and during our research. Most notably, we structured our research around a space mission with the end goal of producing a Martian habitat out of mycelium. The actual Mission Architecture addresses several design problems; how will the mycelium grow on Mars? How will the mycelium grow into a specific shape? What shape will this habitat actually be? How will humans on Mars be able to produce more materials when needed? All these vital questions are explored and evaluated in our Mission Architecture page. These considerations and research have been reflected in our approach in the lab and research.
