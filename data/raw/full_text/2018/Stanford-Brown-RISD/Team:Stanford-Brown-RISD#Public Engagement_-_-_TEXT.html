JUDGING FORM ⇗
Our team engaged with the public about synthetic biology often, most notably when we presented at the NASA Ames Research Center Showcase, the Mountain View Tech Showcase, and the NIAC Symposium in Boston. At all of these events we presented on our project to a diverse audience –– ranging from children to researchers working on NASA. At the showcases we also extended our presentation to what the field of synthetic biology is, teaching through demonstration: having individuals extract strawberry DNA (to the delight of many children) and fold up paper origami. It was also particularly rewarding to hear young people, especially young girls, say how much they our project and that they wanted to pursue an education in science.
NASA Silicon Valley Innovations: From the Earth to the Moon and Mars
At the NASA Silicon Valley Innovations: From the Earth to the Moon and Mars Showcase, we were able to engage with several children and introduce them to the field of synthetic biology. As mentioned above, we conducted quick & fun experiments with children ranging from ages 5 to 10 to extract the DNA from strawberries. We also folded DNA structures with them from printed cut outs, as well as provided a mini Mars like environment to encourage children to play and think about how to build their own dream Space Habitat. We additionally had the opportunity to talk to professionals at NASA who further informed our project and encouraged us to consider different avenues of research. We similarly were able to expose them to the potential for synthetic biology in their own practice.  You can learn more about the NASA Ames Showcase by seeing their webpage linked here.

Mountain View, CA, Tech Showcase
Similarly, at the Mountain View Tech Showcase, we were able to present to a broad range of individuals. We performed similar outreach to children, adults, professionals, and the like. We were able to generally educate individuals on what synthetic biology is, as well as our project and our goals. Additionally, we were able to engage with individuals with diverse perspectives and opinions on the power and potential of synthetic biology, which in turn influenced us to have more sensitivity to particular issues and approach our lab work with fresh perspectives.

NIAC Symposium 2018
A delegation from the team presented at this year's NASA Innovative and Advanced Concepts (NIAC) symposium in Boston, on September 26th, speaking about the utility of "mycotecture" off-planet. Response from the assembled NASA officials was positive, and further informed the team on how to approach presenting such research to individuals both in and outside of the scientific community.

In the bottom right image, Dr. Amy Kronenberg, an expert in radiation biology at the Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and member of the NIAC external advisory committee, passes on one of the team mycelial bricks. Her advice on the need for cosmic radiation protection for astronauts at the beginning of the summer was critical to our mission design.
