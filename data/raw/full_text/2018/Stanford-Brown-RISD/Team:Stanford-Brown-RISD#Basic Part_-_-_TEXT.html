Stanford-Brown-RISD Best Basic Part
This is a version of the peptide computationally designed by Kozisek et al. (Chemistry, 2008) to bind to copper (HHTC). This metal binding domain has had amino acids replaced for specificity, and has a flexible GSGGSG linker attached to allow for spacing for proper folding of the constituent domains in any fusion proteins being created.
