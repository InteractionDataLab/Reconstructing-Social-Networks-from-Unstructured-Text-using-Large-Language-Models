JUDGING FORM â‡—
A software tool is defined as "a program that is employed in the development, repair, or enhancement of other programs or of hardware." Under this definition, the model devised by the SBR iGEM team ought to be eligible as a software tool, as it enhances the function of other programs. The main tenet of our collaboration with DTU was our "cohesive" process: that DTU's two programs form the "beginning" and the "end" of the transition of mycelium from spore to plug and from brick to freestanding structure, while SBR's program forms the "middle"--the transformation of plug to brick. In that the SBR model enhances the function of DTU's two models, it ought to qualify as a software tool.
To read more about our model, please see the modeling entry here.
To read more about our collaboration with DTU on the model, and how these two may work together to produce a software tool, please see our collaboration entry here.
If the reader wishes to test out the model in its capacity as a software tool, a link to an online IDLE environment is provided here complete with the code base. To run the model, simply click on the green box in the upper left-hand corner marked "run", and follow the prompts given in the output box.
