Stanford-Brown-RISD Best Composite Part
This is a fusion protein formed with a Chitin Binding Domain (CBD) and semi-rationally designed copper binding domain (HHTC-Re) as subunits. There are two metal binding domains, allowing for two copper atoms to be bound to each protein molecule. GSGGSG linkers were added in between the CBD and HHTC-Re subunits to spatially isolate the individual domains while still allowing for flexibility.
