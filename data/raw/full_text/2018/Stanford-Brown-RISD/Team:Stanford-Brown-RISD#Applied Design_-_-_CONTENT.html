[2]</P><P style="text-align: center; font-size: 98%">Proposed 3D Printed Design crafted from a Martian Ice. [3]</P></DIV><DIV class="column two_thirds_size"><P>Current ideas that are being explore by NASA involve sending large 3D printers up to Mars that will print with materials sourced from Mars. More specific examples include a composite material made from martian regolith, or using ice found on planet [2, 3]. However, as we interviewed Dr. Michael Meyer, the lead Scientist of NASA’s Mars exploration program, it was highlighted that there are number of issues with these designs. Issues range from designing reliable material from components sourced from Mars to the cost of sending up such a large 3D printer (both in the production of such a large printer, as well as the actual cost per kilogram). Additionally, the materials sourced from Mars would most likely need to be supplemented with binders brought from earth, and could not be applied to interior design elements. </P><P>Our proposal to design a martian habitat from mycelium is therefore a strong concept, as it addresses many of the large concerns regarding habitat development on Mars, and bypasses the drawbacks of other proposed designs.</P><P>Instead of a large 3D printing machine, we would just need to send up a few spores of mycelium, a few supplemental nutrients, and a light-weight mold. Depending on the habitat’s design, we could either grow algae with carbon dioxide sourced from Mars or use martian regolith as the substrate for growth &amp; binding. Furthermore, the mycelium has the potential to be genetically engineered to enhance its properties or have it produce other vital materials. It is also an extremely versatile material, and its mechanical properties can be manipulated. This creates the potential for it to produce everything from the exterior of the habitat to the softer interior products such as furniture and clothes. And as long as you have a few dormant spores, you can continue to grow more materials by simply activating them with sufficient oxygen and nutrients.</P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><P style="text-align: center; font-size: 98%">Stanford Brown RISD's proposed Mars Habitat, made of mycelium that is grown within a light-weight mold. Rendering by team member Emilia Mann.</P><P>The versatility of mycelium as a material, and its self-growing abilities, paired with the fact it is completely biodegradable, means it has the potential to completely revolutionize the housing and manufacturing industries on earth. With a few modifications, our habitat design could be brought to earth to build eco-friendly houses that require minimal effort to assemble. We also took advantage of these properties in the creation of products beyond our habitat – creating furniture items and filters. These prototypes created in our lab, most notably our stool (see images below) demonstrate the potential for its use on and off planet, as an alternative, eco-friendly alternative to plastics and other soft goods.
