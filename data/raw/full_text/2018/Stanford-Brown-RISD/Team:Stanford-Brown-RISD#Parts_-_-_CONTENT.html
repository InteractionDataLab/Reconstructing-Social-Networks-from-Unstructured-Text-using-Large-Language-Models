This composite part consists of a T7 promoter with RBS (BBa_K525998), followed by a coding region for csgA (BBa_K1583000) with a His-Tag expressed at the end, an ochre stop codon, and then a BglII cut site followed by a T7 terminator (BBa_K731721). The construct constitutively produces the amyloid-forming E.coli curlin-precursor protein csgA when restriction ligated into a backbone plasmid of choice. The his-tag allows for the protein product to be purified with standard his-tag protein purification methods. Because of the T7 promoter and RBS, for protein production this construct must be used in T7 cell lines like BL21 that produce T7 RNA polymerase. The SalI and BglII cut sites also allow for the replacement with a desired coding region after the construct is successfully in a plasmid backbone. </TD></TR><TR><TD style="width:20%"><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2868011"> BBa_K2868011 </A></TD><TD style="width:80%"> Composite Part T7 CBD-6xhistag expression </TD></TR><TR><TD style="width:80%; font-size: 70%;"> Designed by Cale Lester.

Expression requires a T7 RNA polymerase because of the T7 constitutive promoter. It is a csgA curlin precursor of E.Coli coding region linked to a Bacillus circulans chitin binding domain with a 6x polyhistidine tag.</P><P>CsgA has well documented amyloid formation behavior and is a main component of E.Coli biofilms, so we theorized that if it were fused to a chitin binding domain the resulting fusion protein would exhibit exceptional adhesive properties to chitin while also remaining cohesive with other csgA-CBD proteins. These traits are extremely attractive for use as a biological adhesive on mycelium substrates, as the fungal cell wall is largely composed of chitin.</P><P>We were able to successfully express our fusion csgA-CBD protein using this composite part on a pSB1C3 plasmid backbone. We then purified the resulting csgA-CBD protein using standard his-tag purification protocols on Ni-NTA resin spin columns, followed by isoelectric precipitation. The final pure protein product tied for the strongest bonding strength on a mycelium substrate out of the proteins we tested, and had the best ratio of strength on mycelium to strength on cardboard.
