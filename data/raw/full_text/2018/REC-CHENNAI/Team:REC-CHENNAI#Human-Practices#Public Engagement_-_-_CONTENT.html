In order to gauge general public knowledge and opinion on various facets of Molecular and Synthetic Biology, we conducted ‘The Hangout’ by setting up an information kiosk. This kiosk was set up on the pavement of Edward Elliot’s Beach, a beach frequented by all demographics. We started ‘The Hangout’ early in the morning in order to attract the first wave of joggers and families who had come out to have a fun day and we were lucky that the date corresponded to that of a marathon, thus diversifying our audience. We handed out survey forms and explained what Synthetic Biology is. We also gave them an insight into what we seek to achieve through iGEM. In order to engage all age groups, we conducted two games that are in relevance to what we seek to achieve with our project. 
</P><H3>Game 1: Red-Green Game</H3><P>
This game required the identification of minute differences between two seemingly similar pictures. If the difference was identified, a green banner was lifted and if there was no difference, then a red-green banner was lifted. The minute differences were to synonymous to mutations and the green or red-green banners were to depict our proposed screening mechanism for mutagenesis that has occurred successfully. All age groups participated in this game and the winners were rewarded. For the slightly older individuals we explained the relevance of this game and we found that their understanding and appreciation of our project and what we aim to achieve increase. 
</P><H3>Game 2:  Touch-It-Not</H3><P>
This game tested the concentration of its players. It involved moving a loop over another convoluted wire making sure that both wires did not come into contact with one another. If the wires did come into contact, a buzzer would emit a sound thereby disqualifying the player. The relevance of this game is to depict the general necessity for lab technicians to be precise and also stressed on the importance of hand-eye coordination in any task requiring perfection.  We gave them relatable examples such as human diagnostic testing and the requirement of the highest form of accuracy within it. This game attracted the younger demographic who thoroughly enjoyed playing it and were inspired to look into Synthetic Biology and its scope.
