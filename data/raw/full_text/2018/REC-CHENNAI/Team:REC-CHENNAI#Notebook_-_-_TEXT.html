March 2018
March 10, 2018
Interviews were held to select students to form the REC-CHENNAI 2018 iGEM team.
March 16, 2018
Final team members were selected and the team was formed
March 20, 2018
First official team meeting
March 25, 2018
First brainstorming session
March was the month of firsts for our team. We bounced ideas off of one another and made ourselves familiar with who we were going to work with and how we were to get as much productive work done as possible. We spent the first few meetings talking about the roles each member was going to play and how we would monitor our progress. It’s safe to say that March was the beginning of our journey into iGEM 2018.

Skype call with VIT iGEM team
April was filled with back-to-back brainstorming sessions. With many a day spent in the deserted classrooms of our college, we managed to finalize what would be our project ‘FluoroScreen’. We familiarized ourselves with our Plan of Action and dived into the depths of Site-Directed Mutagenesis.

HP team discussion
May started with the iGEM Distribution kit on our doorstep. The entire team was there to witness it being opened along with Mr Arun Kumar our Team Advisor. We spent the rest of the month discussing our course of action and getting our lab ready for the number of hours we had to spend. We also had brainstorming sessions about what we wanted to do for Human Practices.

Batch 1. Experiment: Transformation
WET LAB RESULTS
Psb1c3 plasmid backbone containing  BBa_J04450 ( needs to be linked) RFP construct from iGEM 2017 competent cell kit was used to perform the transformation.
Transformation was done for 10 pg/µl and 100 pg/µl plasmid concentration after making DH5α strain of E.coli cells competent.
After transformation, cells were plated on LB agar plates containing Chloramphenicol in two volumes 20µl and 200µl.
Red RFP colonies were obtained and were confirmed by spectrophotometric analysis.
a) Plasmid concentration --  10pg/µl. Cell volume plated -- 200µl
b) Plasmid concentration -- 100pg/µl. Plated cell volume -- 200µl

HP team discussion.
June proved to the one of the busiest months for the entire team. With college functioning side-by-side, we had to push the pedal to the metal to make sure we met deadlines. With multiple optimizations and runs of transformations on-the-go, we used every spare moment we had to execute our innovative ideas for Human Practices.

2018 Plate Reader and CFU protocol was performed wherein various GFP constructs were found in psb1c3 plasmid backbone.
Transformed DH5α E.coli cells were seen in plates containing the construct present in the Negative Control ie BBa_R0040
One green GFP colony was obtained and confirmed by spectrophotometric analysis.

Batch 3. Experiment: InterLab protocol
July proved to be another busy month for us as we reached a consensus on our project name. Based on the project name, we were able to come up with a logo and a team logo that aptly explains who we are and where we come from. In the midst of many days of wet lab experiments, we had a few members of our team represent us at the All India iGEM meet that was held in IISc Bangalore.

Preparation for ‘The Hangout’
August flew past us like a blur of light and with event after event that defined what we are today. We had meetings with renowned people to figure out what we can do to make our project better. We discussed and towards the end of the month, we figured out how to execute our idea of ‘The Hangout’. Our InterLab results were uploaded thus marking the end of a journey filled with joy and happiness alike.
