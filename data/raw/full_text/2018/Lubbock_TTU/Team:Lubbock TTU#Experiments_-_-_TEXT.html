Do NOT let cells get above 4 °C from here on!
Centrifuge at 1000g for 15mins at 4 °C
Decant and Resuspend pellet in 50mL COLD autoclaved water by pipetting
Centrifuge at 1000g for 20mins at 4 °C

Immediately remove ALL of the supernatant!
Resuspend the pellet by gently swirling in 1mL of COLD GYT media 1% Agarose Gel protocol:
1)Measure 1 g of Agarose and 100 ml of 1x TAE buffer in specific flask designated for ethidium bromide
2)Weigh the total of flask and mixture
3)Microwave mixture for 1 minute and power level 10
4)Stir and microwave once more for one minute at power level 10
The mixture should have gone from cloudy to clear
1)Since water has evaporated, weigh the mixture and flask again and add enough water to compensate the amount that evaporated in the microwave
2)Set up the casting apparatus
Put wells in place
Make surface level using the bubble level
1)Add 4 µl ethidium bromide to the mixture and swirl bottle to homogenize
2)Pour mixture into the apparatus. Pop the bubbles with a pipette tip. Keep the bubbles away from the wells
3)Let the gel solidify for 15-20 minutes (should turn opaque when ready)
4)Since you can only add 10 µl into the well:
Make enough small wells with parafilm to match the number of PCR samples
Add 1 µl of dye and 10 µl of PCR sample into the parafilm well and homogenize with pipette tip (dye damages the PCR sample so do not add directly to sample ever)
1)Remove comb carefully from gel and apparatus
2)Fill the apparatus with the 1x TAE buffer so that the gel is completely covered (If it's already full then don't fill it up with new buffer.)
3)Grab the correct DNA ladder and pipette 10 µl into the far left lane
4)Load 10 µl of each sample from the parafilm wells
