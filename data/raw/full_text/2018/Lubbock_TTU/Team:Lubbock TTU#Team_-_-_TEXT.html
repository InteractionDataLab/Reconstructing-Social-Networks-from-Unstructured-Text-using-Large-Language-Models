About Us
The Lubbock TTU iGEM Team is part of a student organization at Texas Tech University known as iGEM Raiders. Our mission is to expose the university and community to synthetic biology through undergraduate initiative and involvement in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition. This year, the iGEM Raiders team is composed of 8 dedicated undergraduate and graduate students with backgrounds in cell & molecular biology, biochemistry, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and chemical engineering. The diversity within our team enables the iGEM Raiders to tackle novel project ideas.
