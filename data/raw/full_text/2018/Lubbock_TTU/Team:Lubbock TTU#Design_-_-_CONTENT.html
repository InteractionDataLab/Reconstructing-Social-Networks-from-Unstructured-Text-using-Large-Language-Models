The TTU iGEM Team would like to sincerely thank the following mentors for their guidance and support through our journey during the 2018 iGEM Competition.<B>Primary PI:</B> Dr. John D’Auria generously granted the TTU iGEM Team the opportunity to conduct research in his lab space and offered his time and commitment as a mentor. We are thankful for his help with ordering supplies, supporting our fundraising efforts, and providing critical feedback on our research efforts. Dr. D’Auria helped guide the team towards a feasible project that can be conducted within his lab while providing us the flexibility to determine how we would like to execute our research objectives.
<B>Secondary PI:</B>  Dr. Michael Latham kindly offered his time to teach the team how to use the plate reader for the InterLab study and future research objectives. During team meetings he directed the team towards feasible goals for the competition. We look forward to future research activities with Dr. Latham.
<B>Advisor:</B> Dr. Serra-Ruth Moreno assisted the team with troubleshooting the protocols for lambda red recombineering in our E. coli host chassis and our mutagenesis assays.
<B>Advisor:</B> Dr. Roger Sutton provided the team with guidance for dry lab objectives and has always offered the team his support through access to lab space and technical advice regarding structural investigations.
<B>Advisor:</B> Julie Isom has always been a substantial supporter of the TTU iGEM Team and she serves as the director for the iGEM Raiders Student Organization on TTU campus and the Associate Program Director of Research for CISER. Julie assisted the team by providing financial support and managerial assistance through the entire competition.


We would like to express our gratitude to the following financial supporters of iGEM for making the iGEM experience possible for students at Texas Tech University.
