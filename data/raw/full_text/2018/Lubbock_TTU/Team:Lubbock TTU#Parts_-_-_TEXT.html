Title
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:

Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Part Table
Please include a table of all the parts your team has made during your project on this page. Remember part characterization and measurement data must go on your team part pages on the Registry.
