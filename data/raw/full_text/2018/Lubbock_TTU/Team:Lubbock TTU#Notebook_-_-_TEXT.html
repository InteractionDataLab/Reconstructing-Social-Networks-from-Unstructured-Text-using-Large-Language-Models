Inter-Lab Study
 July 15th
For this week, the group split up to tackle the inter-lab study experiments. Jeff and Paula started the plate reader protocol, which Ben finished later that day. However, due to scheduling issues, the flow cytometer was unavailable. We later repeated this experiment with the extra credit portion after asking for an extension from iGEM HQ. We are having issues with our experiment. We decided to redesign primers for the lambda proteins on the pREDKI plasmid rather than on the I-SceI gene to insure that there were no issues with the recombination step.
Making Plates
 July 16th
We made Arabinose + Kan and Kan + Spec plates. Ben tried another electroporation of the pREDKI containing W3110 cells.
Electroporation day 2
 July 17th
After allowing the cells a longer incubation period, we came in to make a master plate and check on our colonies. They had grown very weakly, and we decided to run a colony PCR to ensure that the spec template had been inserted into the genome.
Colony PCR
 July 19th
We Ran a colony PCR, but the pREDKI plasmid didn't show up in our cells.
Colony PCR Take 2
 July 20th
After a meeting with our mentor, we redesigned our controls and re-ran the PCR. We still had issues.
Re-Priming
 July 23rd
We decided to redesign our primers and check their annealing temperatures. We found discrepancies with the temperatures we had been using and the actual annealing temperatures.
The (Lab) Notebook
 July 27th
We held our weekly lab meeting. We talked about our project progress, and keeping our individual lab notebooks up to date. We also re-did the InterLab study, with the optional flow-cytometry section.
  
AUGUST

SEPTEMBER
New Member Recruitment
 September 3rd-6th
Jeff and Paula visited several colleges and gave talks to classes about the opportunities and benefits iGEM had to offer. Over 30 new undergraduates, from Freshmen to Seniors and consisting of dozens of majors showed interest in iGEM. Unfortunately for everyone, this made the application process very competitive! In the lab, We worked on making chemical competent DH5alpha cells and performing a transformation of both pREDKI and the florescent plasmids.
First Friday Art Trail
 September 7th
The Lubbock_TTU team went to the monthly First Friday Art Trail in Lubbock to showcase our research and educate the public about synthetic biology.Thousands of people come to the downtown arts district for live music, food trucks, and of course - spectacular art.   iGEM decided to take our own approach to art - streaking GFP transformed E.Coli onto plates in fantastic shapes! We also painted a few "traditional" paintings ourselves! We invited members of the community to view our artwork while we questioned them regarding basic knowledge of synthetic biology. Members of the team educated enthusiastic patrons about the field of synthetic biology, the iGEM competition, the protocols for the artwork, ethical dilemmas associated with biology, and the long term goals and effects of our project. Many people were surprised to find out that bacteria can be little factories for our medicines!
