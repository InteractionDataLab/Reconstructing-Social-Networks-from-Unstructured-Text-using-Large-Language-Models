Jeff Dui
As a student in SMS that had attend the last iGEM competition, I am eager to share my experience and give humble suggestions to our team this year. I will continue to focus on the design and experiments for enzymes which l have accumulated deeper understanding in some degree. iGEM is an innovative competition that not only requires hard work but also demands for cooperation within team and between teams at the same time. I am glad to found a place like this at which I can make accomplishments on fileds  I interested.

Hello everyone! My name is Jinfan Huang and I am a high school student in the Shenzhen Middle School. I like running, listening to musics, and I'm a fan of FC Bayern club. Out of curiosity about the microcosm and love of biotechnology, I joined igem, hoping to enrich my research experience here, and to recognize more like-minded friends.
Meng Sun
Hello everyone! I am Meng Sun from the Senior 3 in the International Curriculum of Shenzhen Middle School. In our iGEM team, I joined the experimental group, the HP group, and the art group. I am a lively and outgoing person who have a wide range of hobbies. I love to dance and to communicate with people around me. Of course, I am also extremely passionate with biology. Therefore, I joined iGEM for my love of micro-scale genetic experiments. I hope that I can learn more professional knowledge about synthetic biology and develop my academic ability during the iGEM competition. I also hope that I can make many like-minded friends and work with them together to strive for the competition.
Yiheng Ye
I’m Yiheng Ye from SMS. I have abundant knowledge about Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, and my interests spread from literature to art. Aiming to apply science knowledge on solving actual problems and those unpredictable issues that come by, I participated iGEM to challenge myself, longing for fascinating “Urica” moments after conquering tasks.
Heyi Xu
Hi, I am Heyi Xu, a senior in Shenzhen Middle School. I love solving real world problems and look synthetic biology as a useful tool, so I participate in iGEM throughout high school years and I am the team leader this year. Enjoying our Pesticide Mate project this year, I hope to make farming more sustainable in the future.
Hanyi Mao
Hi, I’m Hanyi Mao, a junior in SZMS. I designed the project and took part in the theoretical construction of it. With strong interest in biology, I hope our teeth cleaner project this year can not only bring real benefit but also inspire people to learn about synthetic biology.
Qinxi Liu
Hi, I am Qinxi Liu from Shenzhen Middle School. My nick name is Cici. In my spare time, I like drawing and jogging. As for school, physics and biology attract me most by their mysterious but intriguing principles of life, universe and the world we live in. Being one of the IGEM members, I enjoy learning genetic biology apart from classroom and doing experiments based our own design. The logic behind an experiment is rather complex and elaborate, which requires various background information and comprehensive anticipation of various contingency, while a completed project enables us to develop thorough communication and integrated ability. Overall, I love the experience in IGEM and look forward to the any further cooperation ! !
