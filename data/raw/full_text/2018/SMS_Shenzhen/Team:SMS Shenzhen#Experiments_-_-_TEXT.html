I Overview of Experiment Design Ideas
There are three crucial aspects we can focus on to prove the plausibility of our design concept, including the preliminary characteristic determination of participant sugars, the enzyme activities of the two target enzymes in realistic conditions of oral cavities, and the optic observations about the enzyme effectiveness on real scale teeth.

Experiment 1: Preliminary Experiments:
We characterize the stability of reaction participant sugers in various of realistic thermal and pH conditions

Experiment 2: Enzyme Activity Measurements
We measure the activity of two target enzymes - DexA and FruA

Experiment 3: Optic Observation of Enzyme Effectiveness on Teeth sample
We demonstrated how our project will function on real scale teeth by using colour developing agent of dental plaque and image analysis
