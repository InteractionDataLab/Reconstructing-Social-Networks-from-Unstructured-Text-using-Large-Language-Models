Title
InterLab
This year, team SMS_Shenzhen has successfully participated in the Interlab measurement. We were able to construct a calibration curve, which helps with converting absorbance of the cell to known concentration of silicon beads. We determined cell concentration by counting colony-form units. This way, we were able to contribute to the elimination of law variability.
