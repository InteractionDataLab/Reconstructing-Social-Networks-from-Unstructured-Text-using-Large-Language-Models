Sricharan Kadimi
Year: Senior
Major: Chemical Engineering
iGEM Position: President
When Sricharan isn’t in iGEM lab, he can be found running or falling off his bike. He firmly believes he is not superstitious but also thinks that he fell because he forgot to knock on wood before getting on the bike. Eek. Talents include laughing and eating spicy food until he cries, puns (both good and bad), and getting way too excited about “to deliver” graduated cylinders. Sricharan wins the Biggest Nerd Award due to the fact that he dreams about iGEM experiments and he asked for High Fidelity Phusion Polymerase for his half birthday.
Peter Crowley
Year: Sophomore
Major: Mechanical Engineering
iGEM Position: Dry Lab Chair
Peter’s secret talent is impressions, and his favorite pastime is quoting SNL skits or Monty Python and the Holy Grail. His life aspiration is to be a Knight Who Says Ni, although he will never really achieve his goals because he likes green apples. Apparently, Peter just has strange eating habits, though, because he is known to use granola bars as spoons and refuses to eat cold pizza. If you ever need a petty thief, Peter is the one to call, as long as you don’t mind the stolen goods being logged on the online lab inventory.
Ryan Chen
Year: Sophomore
Major: Molecular and Cell Biology
Ryan has one dream for the future of UConn iGEM: iGEM nap time. He plots to hang hammocks in the lab for easy access between experiments. When awake, he is busy working on designing our amazing BASSET logo or eating grapefruit. Ryan is never caught without his Chance the Rapper hat, nor has he ever turned down the chance to make agar plates, earning him the reputation of Plate Guy.
Malik Harris
Year: Senior
Major: Digital Media and Design
If you want someone to talk to about technology for hours on end, Malik is your guy. He loves computers, phones, cameras, and so much more - except printers; they are the bane of his existence. He also enjoys watching horror films, especially late at night. When he's not busy working on our awesome Wiki site, he can be found playing Farming Simulator, meticulously tending to his crops. Malik is a spicy guy, who puts hot sauce on almost anything, and likes to cover his pizza in crushed red peppers. To him, the spice of life is spice itself.
Shannon Doyle
Year: Graduated
Major: Molecular and Cell Biology
For assistance with deciding on an ice cream flavor, please consult Shannon. UConn’s famous Dairy Bar has taught her all the essential skills from how to sneak samples throughout her shift to how to keep ice cream frozen overnight. Although destined to be a Texas cowgirl, Shannon currently keeps the companionship of a sweet German Shepherd instead of a horse. In addition to iGEM, Shannon enjoys discussing the Bachelorette and cajun seasoning (but not on ice cream).
Liz Chamiec-Case
Year: Sophomore
Major: Physiology and Neurobiology
iGEM Position: Wiki Chair
This earthy crunchy, manual Honda Fit-driving, vegan member of UConn iGEM contributes to iGEM by dropping anything that she picks up (what a flubaroo!). She speaks in a sound-based language composed of grunts, extended consonant sounds, and squeaks. Did you know that, in Liz, “uh-uh” means serological pipettor? Fascinating. The quickest way to her heart is to put a squirrel on her shoulder, or squirrels in her bed, or just reference squirrels at all. She’s probably too busy laughing at the bad joke someone made to hear that squirrel reference though. Just watch out for her spinning keys, which have a ferocious bite.
