For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.</P></DIV><DIV class="column third_size"><DIV class="highlight decoration_B_full"><H3> Can we base our project on a previous one? </H3><P>Yes!
