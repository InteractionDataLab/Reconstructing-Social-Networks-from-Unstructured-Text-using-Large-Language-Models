Safety
Safety has been our ultimate goal since we began our project. In an attempt to improve our personal protection the team was involved in multiple training seminars. We all completed University of Illinois safety training which included videos and quizzes. We also completed safety training for the Carl Woese Institute of Genomic Biology. Our lab space also had a specific lab safety presentation about their specific requirements and protocols. We learned so much from all of these training sessions which led us to have a very safe and effective work space. We also completed the iGEM safety sheets which allowed us to discussion in more detail with our mentors the safety of our specific project.  A few of the practical safety precautions we used everyday:
1. Closed toed shoes
2. Gloves
3. Proper sterile technique
4. Always having another member present while doing lab work
