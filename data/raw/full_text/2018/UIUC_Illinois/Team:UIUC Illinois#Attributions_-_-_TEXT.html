2018 UIUC Illinois iGEM Team
The UIUC Illinois iGEM undergraduates were responsible for almost every aspect of the iGEM project, from project development to wiki design to performing and scheduling experiments to preparing the presentation but they could not have done it without the help of many experienced individuals! Many thanks to everyone who contributed time, funds, experience, thoughts, space, tools, and skill to the success of UIUC Illinois iGEM team.
