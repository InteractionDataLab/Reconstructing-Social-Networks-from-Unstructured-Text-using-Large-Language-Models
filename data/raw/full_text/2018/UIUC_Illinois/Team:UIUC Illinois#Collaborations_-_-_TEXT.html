UIUC Illinois 2018 iGEM Midwest Meet Up w/ Washington University in St. Louis
On August 17th, a couple of team members from Washington University in St. Louis iGEM team came to our Midwest meet up. We listened to Dr. Ting Lu give a presentation on his work in the field of synthetic biology. Both teams gave presentations to each other about our projects and the work we were conducting. We talked about problems we were facing and gave each other advice on how to overcome these problems. The WashU iGEM team was having some trouble with their PCR, so we gave them advice by explaining how we successfully completed ours. They provided us with resources needed to obtain important materials for our research for free such as competent cells. We had a great time learning and getting to know each other.
University of Nebraska-Lincoln Collaboration
Additionally, we collaborated with the University of Nebraska- Lincoln on their new safety project: A "Safety Case". A Safety Case is:"a proactive technique used to visualize the safety of a synthetic biology project and its end goal." One can use this program to visualize any possible safety concerns with your current project. We input our data in and saw that we should consider adding a kill switch to our Yeast and LAB strains in case they ever were ever introduced into nature.
Collaboration with Imperial College of London
We helped  Imperial College of London on their "Lets talk about this" project. This project allow colleagues to better communicate and solve internal social conflicts. This could create a better work environment and a more efficient work space
