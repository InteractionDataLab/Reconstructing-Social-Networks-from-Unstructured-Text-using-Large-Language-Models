Modeling
We constructed computational growth models of our S. cerevisiae/L. lactis co-culture based on monod kinetics. The monod equation is a simplified model for relating the growth rate of an organism to the concentration of a limiting substrate. We constructed out models based on the assumption that both organisms used glucose as their limiting substrate. These models informed what we expected to see in the lab.
We utilized the Gro programming language to simulate the growth conditions of our co-culture.
We utilized MatLab's ode45 function to solve the differential equation for the density of each species in the culture. In this figure, the red line represents glucose concentration, the blue line represents L. lactis density and the orange line represents yeast density.
