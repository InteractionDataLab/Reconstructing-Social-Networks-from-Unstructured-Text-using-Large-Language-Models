UIUC Illinois 2018 iGEM Team
The UIUC Illinois 2018 iGEM Team is made up of 3 Biochemistry majors and two Molecular and Cellular Biology majors. Four of the five members will be attending graduate school, and the fifth will be attending medical school. Outside of their academic lives, they participate in activities ranging from building bionic arms to taking the blood pressure of economically distressed patients. They have spent the summer and the beginning of the Fall 2018 semester working together with the guidance of mentors Shekar Mishra, Carl Shultz and Mathew Waugh.
