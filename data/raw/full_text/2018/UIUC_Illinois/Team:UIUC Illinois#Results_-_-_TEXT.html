All of our Data and Tables
The above section showed some of the positive and negative results that we have compiled over the course of the year. If you are interested in see all of our work, below are links to two pdfs that contain all of our data and results from close to 6 months worth of work. Enjoy.

Future Direction:
Using the information we have collected from a summer of research and experimentation we can begin to work on metabolic engineering of yeast and LAB. Using metabolic engineering we would be able to create high throughput products like polylactic acid using glucose flux.
