COMPETENT CELL PREPARATION
 
Incubate the cells in 10 ml LB medium overnight at 37°C.
Dilute the overnight culture with 1:100 ratio.
Incubate for 2 hours 37°C until OD600 value is in between 0.2-0.6.
Split the culture into two ice-chilled falcon tubes and chill the samples on ice for 10 minutes.
Centrifuge the samples for 10 minutes at 4200 g at 4°C and remove the supernatant.
Resuspend the cells by pipetting with ice-chilled TSS buffer 1:10 ratio. NOTE: Perform the step on ice.
Add 100 μl of resuspended sample to ice-chilled 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. Store at -80 °C. NOTE: Perform the step on ice.
 
 
TRANSFORMATION
 
Competent cells are put on ice until they are deforested. Add 100 ng of plasmid except the control group and keep the cells on ice for 30 minutes.
Put the cells on the heat block for 45 seconds at 42°C, then put them back on the ice for 2 minutes.
Add 250 μl LB medium.
Incubate the cells for 45 minutes in 37°C incubator.
Centrifuge the cells at 5800 g for 5 minutes.
Remove the supernatant (approximately 100 μl supernatant should be left in the tube).
Resuspend the cells by pipetting and spread them on agar plates.
Incubate the agar plates overnight at 37°C.

SDS GEL ELECTROPHORESIS
Preparation of SDS gel
For a 5 ml stacking gel:
H20 2.975 ml
0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH:6.8 1.25 ml
10%(w/v) SDS 0.05 ml
Acrylamide/Bis-acrylamide (30%/0.8%) 0.67 ml
10% (w/v) ammonium persulfate (APS) 0.05 ml
TEMED 0.005 ml
Note: APS and TEMED must be added right before each use.
For a 10 ml separating gel:
 
We load 20 ul of the samples mixed with loading dye and run at 120 V.
After the run we place the gel in a container with Coomassie Blue dye for staining and microwave for 15-40 seconds. The gel should be checked in between to be safe.
The container is put on shaker for 10 minutes the washed under water.
We then place the gel into another container with Destaining Buffer and it can be put on shaker overnight for the destaining. The bands are usually clearly visible the next morning.  
 
WESTERN BLOT
Before setting up the cassettes we place Whatman filter papers into Transfer Buffer, and the nitrocellulose membrane into methanol first for a few minutes then into Transfer Buffer as well.
One of the Whatman papers is placed in the cassette and flattened with the rolling apparatus gently so there are no bubbles trapped.
The membrane is placed on to the first paper and the gel is placed onto the membrane. The second layer of Whatman paper goes onto the gel. After placing each layer we roll over them with the apparatus again gently to smooth out the bubbles.
We place this cassette inside the tank and it is set to Turbo -> Mini Gel -> Run for a 7-minute transfer.
While the transfer is occurring we prepare the Blocking Buffer with 5% dry milk in TBS-T. This solution can be used up to a few times so we do not discard it, keep it at -20.
When the transfer is over we take the membrane out with tweezers gently and the top corner is marked to know which side is up.
The membrane is placed inside the milk solution and incubated inside the shaker for 1-2 hours at RT.
Then we place the membrane carefully into the 1st Antibody solution (1:10000 in 5% dry milk solution in TBS-T) and keep it rocking on the shaker for another 1 hour at RT or O/N at +4 (cold room).
Remove primary Ab solution and keep it at -20 (up to 5 usages) then we put enough TBS-T to cover it, leaving it rocking for another 5 minutes. Afterwards the membrane is washed twice, first for 5 then for 10 minutes.
Then we expose the membrane to the 2nd Antibody (1:10000 in 5% dry milk solution in TBS-T) for 1 hour at RT, rotating.
Remove secondary Ab solution and keep it at -20 (up to 5 usages) then we put enough TBS-T to cover it, leaving it rocking for another 5 minutes. Afterwards the membrane is washed twice, first for 5 then for 10 minutes.
Then we take the image of the membrane.
DO IT IN DARK!!! Take 500ul A and B from ECL solution substrates and mix. Apply the solution on membrane and wait for 1 min. Remove the substrate and take the image.
