Toronto
This year our projects are on similar topics with Toronto iGEM team, we both worked on antibiotic remediation from wastewater using different approaches. We sent Toronto team a peptide sequence that could be helpful in their research and they sent us a model they use in their project that could help improving our project in further steps.
OUC-China
OUC-China team  prepared a fun comic book to tell public about synthetic biology and we translated the comic book into our language, Turkish to use in promoting our project, iGEM and the synthetic biology applications. Here you can see the cover of the English version. For Turkish translation of the comic book, see the link below.
