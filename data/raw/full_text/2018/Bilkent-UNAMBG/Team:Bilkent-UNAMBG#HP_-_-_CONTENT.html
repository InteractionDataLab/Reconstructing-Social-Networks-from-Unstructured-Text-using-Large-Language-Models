You must clearly state the work that was done by the students on your team and note any work that was done by people outside of your team, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.

We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.</P><P>
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.</P></DIV><DIV class="column third_size"><DIV class="highlight decoration_B_full"><H3> Can we base our project on a previous one? </H3><P>Yes!
