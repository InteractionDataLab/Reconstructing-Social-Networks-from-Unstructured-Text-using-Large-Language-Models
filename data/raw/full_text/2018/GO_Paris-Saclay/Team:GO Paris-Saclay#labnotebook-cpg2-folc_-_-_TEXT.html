DNA was digested 1h at 37°C.
Electrophoresis gel of digestion and gel clean-up :
Migration step lasted 20 minutes at 100V with a 0,8% agarose gel.
Spin column gel cleanup was done according to the protocol [NucleoSpin Macherey-Nagel].

This new size obtained can be our vector without the insert cpg2. So, we purified our DNA and we obtained our expected size.

Ligation to achieve pPS18-20 (pSB1C3/cpg2/folC)
2 µL of vector pPS18-13.5 purified and digested (18 ng) were ligate with 6 µL of each insert folC (from pPS18-17.2, pPS18-17.5 or pPS18-17.7) (11 ng). Ligation was let overnight in the fridge.

Transformation of the ligation product (pPS18-20)
DH5α competent cells were transformed with 4 µL of our ligation products (10/08). After heat choc, LB was added and cells were left to grow 2h at 37°C. Cell cultures were spread on two LB + Cm (30 ng/µL) plates (1/10 of culture then the rest).

Trasformation results : we had some clones on each plates (around 20) and we had nothing on negative control.
Colony PCR
12 clones by each contruction were tested with this PCR.
