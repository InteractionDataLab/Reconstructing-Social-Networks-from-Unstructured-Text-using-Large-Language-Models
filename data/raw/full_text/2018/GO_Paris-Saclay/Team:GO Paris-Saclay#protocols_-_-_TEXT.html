PROTOCOLS
Agar plate
Dissolve the LB-agar in the microwave
Cool the agar down to room temperature until you can hold the bottle by hand.
Add the correct amount of the correct antibiotic.
Under sterile conditions, pour the LB-agar in empty Petri dishes.
Leave the Petri dishes open until the agar has solidified
Colony PCR (DreamTaq polymerase)
Prepare the mix for all the samples in a single 1.5 mL tube. For one sample
Add the total volume per sample (without DNA) to each PCR tube.
Add the template DNA to each tube.
Put the tubes in the PCR machine and apply the following program (it needs to be adjusted for primers annealing temperature and extension time):
Run a DNA electrophoresis following the DNA electrophoresis protocol.

Digestion assay
Decide on which enzyme(s) to cut with. Check online what buffer the enzyme(s) work(s) in. For Bio labs enzyme use the Double Digest Finder.
Prepare a sample as follows:
Incubate for one hour at 37 °C.
DNA concentration measurement (NanoDrop)
Turn on the NanoDrop
Press the button for dsDNA to measure the concentration of double-stranded DNA in your samples.
Clean the measurement surface with a piece of tissue and ethanol.
Use the elution buffer or the media where your DNA is contained as a blank.
Clean the measurement surface with a piece of tissue and water.
Use 2 µL of sample to measure its concentration.
If you have multiple samples, clean the measurement surface in between measurements.
DNA electrophoresis
Pour the solution Agarose (0, 8%)-EtBr into the mould. Add a comb to create wells for the samples. Let it solidify (approx. 20 minutes).
Transfer the gel to the electrophoresis Remove the combs and cover it with TAE (0, 5 X). Transfer the gel to the electrophoresis.
Load the molecular weight marker (ladder) in the first well (check the appropriate volume for each marker, generally 5 µL works fine) and load 5-10 µL of the samples in the other wells.
Use the elution buffer or the media where your DNA is contained as a blank.
Run at 100 V for 25 min
Gel product purification (Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean-up)
Heat-shock Transformation
Ligation assay
Liquid culture (5 mL)
Midi and MaxiPrep (Qiagen)
MiniPrep
PCR phusion
PCR product purification (Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean-up)
PCR with q5
Plasmid DNA extraction (Mini, midi and maxi Prep)
