Sorbonne Université
Our collaboration with Sorbonne université was the best experience of collaboration. Informatician and designers of Sorbonne team guide us and helped us with the coding part of iGEM  wiki , and also with the sketching process of our new logo.
The mathematician of our team also collaborate with  the Sorbonne university team in their modelling part of their project.
Grenoble
In collaboration with the iGEM Grenoble team we created the: “Take a famous painting and throw some biology in it challenge”. Pictures were posted on social media, the one with the most “likes” wins the competition. A very fun challenge indeed, a nice break from the lab during the summer.
Dusseldorf
We collaborated with Dusseldorf iGEM team and we participating team designs a postcard which shows an image related to synthetic biology (or your topic) on the front and a small informational text on the back. Afterwards each team’s postcards are exchanged with other iGEM-teams so that every team can collect postcards from all over the world. The received postcards can then be shared with people in the neighbourhood, during public events etc. We choose to put the picture of our challenge in the front, and in the back a brief description of the Grenoble and the GO Paris Saclay teams.
Sorbonne Université Paris and Bordeaux
With the help of Sorbonne University and the Bordeaux IGEM team, we organised a Seminar , the 26 of september, about synthetic Biology. Aliaa El Dairouty (PHD student in public law), Alexei Grinbaud( researcher at CEA) and Pierre Crozet (lecturer at Sorbonne University) were kind enough to join our little project and introduce different topics to our audience. We hope this collaboration between our 3 team will last in time, in the IGEM competition. Go check out the picture of the lecture.
