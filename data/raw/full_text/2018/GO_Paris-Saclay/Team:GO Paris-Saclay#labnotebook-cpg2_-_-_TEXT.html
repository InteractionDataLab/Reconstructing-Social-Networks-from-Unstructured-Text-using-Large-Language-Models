Ligation of pGEM-T Easy / cpg2 (pPS18-08)
2 µL of vector pGEM-T Easy digested (2 ng) were ligate with 4 µL of insert cpg2 digested (? ng). Ligation were let overnight in the fidge.

Transformation of the ligation product (pPS18-08)
DH5α competent cells were transformed with 5 µL of our ligation product (06/07). After heat choc, 450 µL LB was added and cells were left to grow 1h at 37°C. Cell cultures were spread on two LB IPTG X-gal Ampicillin plates (1/10 of culture then the rest). No negative control made.

Transformation results and cultures
There are plenty of clones for the ligations pGEM-T Easy / cpg2, but most of them are blue (which means closed vector). However, 5 white clones were put in 4 mL LB + Ampicillin, X-gal and IPTG overnight at 37°C and named pPS18-08.1, …, pPS18-08.5.

Sequencing analysis COL18-052W
pPS18-08.1 : Extensive matching. Prefix was partially destroyed : EcoRI site is not garbled. NotI is preserved, XbaI is preserved. Suffix was partially destroyed. SpeI is preserved. NotI is preserved. PstI is garbled. There is a missing C in the terminator, which is probably fine.
pPS18-08.2 : Extensive matching. More analysis needed to verify sequence. Prefix was partially destroyed : EcoRI site is not garbled. NotI is preserved, XbaI is preserved. Suffix was partially destroyed. SpeI is preserved. NotI is preserved. PstI is garbled. There is a missing C in the terminator, which is probably fine. However, there is a missing G in the CDS (pos 494), which is very bad (frameshift of the last third of the protein.)
Conclusion : Glycerol stocks of pPS18-08.1 and .2 are made. pPS18-08.1 will be used for further construction

Sequencing analysis COL18-05LB
pPS18-13.5 and pPS18-13.22 both have the insert cpg2. We aslo saw, like previously digestion showed, that pPS18-13.5’s insert has the good orientationcontrary to pPS18-13.22.
We thought our preparation contains both empty and good vector, but the sequencing data suggest us our preparation is pure.
Conclusion : Glycerol stocks of pPS18-13.5 is made. pPS18-13.5 will be used for further constructions.
