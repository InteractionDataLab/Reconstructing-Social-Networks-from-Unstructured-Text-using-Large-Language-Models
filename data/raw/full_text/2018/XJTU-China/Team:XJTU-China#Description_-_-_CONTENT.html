The design philosophy of synthetic biology: top-down and bottom-up meets and thus is how we come up with this idea. </P><P>The first idea comes from the dillema for those who want to lose weight, or especilly for those who suffer from diabetes: health and taste. Sugar are delightful but the energy it provides may lead to trouble. That's the reason why a variety of sugar substitutes emerges, but none without a clear record of health concerns. That's the reason here we introduce psicose, a rare sugar, the C-3 epimer of fructose, which is the ultimate solution of saccrose substitute: a balance between sweetness and low energy (about 3% of that in saccrose).</P><P>Chemical manufacturing of psicose is laborous and poses trouble in chiral separation. Biomanufacturing is promising but suffers severely from low enzymatic activity. The goal of our team is to find a reliable, robust and high throughput method in screening for enzymes with high activity.</P><P>The second idea emerges from the concerns about the instability of traditional continuous-culture-based directed evolution. Why a accelerated Darwinian evolution is never achieved with simple tools of pressure-introducing such as toxic proteins or antibiotics? We would manage to build up a Standard Framework for Directed Evolution with detailed data and standarized procedures.</P><P>We are applying this exciting new method in searching for a more optimized enzyme for the biomanufacturing of psicose.</P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><H3>Gallery</H3><DIV class="coursel"><DIV class="courselCont"><P style="text-align:center;" class="courselTag">Lab overview 1</P></DIV><DIV class="courselCont"><P style="text-align:center;" class="courselTag">Lab overview 2</P></DIV><DIV class="courselCont"><P style="text-align:center;" class="courselTag">Lab overview 3</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
