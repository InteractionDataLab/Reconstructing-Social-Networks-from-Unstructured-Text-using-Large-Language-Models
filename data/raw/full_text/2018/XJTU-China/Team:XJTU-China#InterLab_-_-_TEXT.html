InterLab
Overview
Synthetic biology requires reliable and repeatable measurement. However, the ability to repeat measurements in different labs has been difficult for different units or different ways may be used in various groups. The InterLab Study is part of the Measurement Committee’s continuing effort to develop a standard measurement procedure for green fluorescent protein (GFP). In order to improve reproducibility, we used plate readers to take measurements of fluorescence and absorbance this year.

Methods
Day 1: transform Escherichia coli DH5α with given plasmids (all in pSB1C3)
Day 2: Pick 2 colonies from each of the transformation plates and inoculate in 5-10 mL LB medium + Chloramphenicol. Grow the cells
Day 3: Cell growth, sampling, and assay
Make a 1:10 dilution of each overnight culture in LB+Chloramphenicol (0.5mL of culture into 4.5mL of LB+Chlor)
Measure Abs 600 of these 1:10 diluted cultures
Dilute the cultures further to a target Abs600 of 0.02 in 50 mL falcon tube
Take 500 µL samples of the diluted cultures at 0 hours into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes, prior to incubation.Place the samples on ice.
Incubate the remainder of the cultures at 37°C and 220 rpm for 6 hours.
Take 500 µL samples of the cultures at 6 hours of incubation into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes. Place samples on ice.
Measure samples (Abs fluorescence measurement).
Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E. coli cultures
Step 1: Starting Sample Preparation
Measure the OD600 of the cell cultures and dilute to the linear detection range of the plate reader, e.g. to 0.05 – 0.5 OD600 range.
Dilute the overnight culture to OD600 = 0.1 in 1mL of LB + Cam media. Do this in triplicate for each culture.
Check the OD600 and make sure it is 0.1.
Step 2: Dilution Series Instructions
For each Starting Sample (total for all 12 showed in italics in paraenthesis):
We need 3 LB Agar + Cam plates (36 total).
Prepare three 2.0 mL tubes (36 total) with 1900 ºL of LB + Cam media for Dilutions 1, 2, and 3 (see figure below).
Prepare two 1.5 mL tubes (24 total) with 900 ºL of LB + Cam media for Dilutions 4 and 5 (see figure below)..
Label each tube according to the figure below (Dilution 1, etc.) for each Starting Sample.
Pipet 100 ºL of Starting Culture into Dilution 1. Discard tip. Do NOT pipette up and down. Vortex tube for 5-10 secs.
Repeat Step 5 for each dilution through to Dilution 5 as shown below.
Aseptically spead plate 100 ºL on LB + Cam plates for Dilutions 3, 4, and 5.
Incubate at 37°C overnight and count colonies after 18-20 hours of growth.
Step 3: CFU/mL/OD Calculation Instructions
Based on the assumption that 1 bacterial cell gives rise to 1 colony, colony forming units (CFU) per 1mL of an OD600 = 0.1 culture can be calculated as follows:
Count the colonies on each plate with fewer than 300 colonies.
Multiple the colony count by the Final Dilution Factor on each plate.
