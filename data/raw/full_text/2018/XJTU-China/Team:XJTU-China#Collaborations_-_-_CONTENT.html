                This year we collaborate with Jilin_China from Jilin University.
              </P><P>
                We meet them during the CCiC meeting in China, we were then aware of their large amounts of RNA-based thermosensors to submit to the part registry. In addition, we have our experience with Golden Gate assembly. Therefore, <STRONG>we provide our help to construct the standardized parts: RT104 for them.</STRONG></P><P>
                The parts is shown below, the number of the conserved sequence in the device is RT104.
              </P><P>
                We inserted an 60bp DNA fragment into the pSB1C3 plasmid. The DNA fragment contains BsaI restriction site. Golden Gate assembly will enable fast and efficient parts construction. We sent the device to them as quickly as possible and hopefully it will improve their experimental efficiency and reduce their work.
              </P><P>
                The plasmid was confirmed to be constructed as expectation by enzyme digestion (original plasmid, BsaI single digestion, and EcoRI and PstI double digestion). We sequenced it, and the sequencing results shows the positive result.
              </P><P>
                Moreover, <STRONG>Jilin_China also help us with the measurement of our Device A</STRONG>. We test the data once, however, after analyzing the data, we were then aware of several problems. For example, we suspected that both LB culture medium and psicose in the system may probably make the bacteria grow, and the osmotic pressure is not controlled. Therefore, we asked Jilin_China to re-suspended the bacterial precipitation with MM culture medium and test the data. The result is shown below.
              </P><P>
                Except for this cooperation, we also discussed our protocol in Golden Gate assembly and we solved many problems for each other that were encountered during the experiment. We also discuss some questions about modeling.

                This year, XJTU-China, NPU-China, and NWU-China held the first iGEM meet-up in north-wets session of China. We shared our projects with each other, and the other two teams shared their experiences with iGEM with us.
              </P><P>
                Moreover, we helped them to contact the patch clamp detecting instrument, to fulfil the requirement they raised during the meet-up.
              </P></DIV><DIV id="section3"><DIV class="page-header"><H2>NPU_China</H2></DIV><BUTTON class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:NPU-China/Collaborations">Go to NPU_China</A></BUTTON><H3>Communications and meet-up</H3><P>
                Because it’s the first year for us to take part in iGEM, we were quite unfamiliar with the progress, and about how to choose a project and how to organize a team. We invited NPU-China to guide us from the beginning of the process.
              </P><P>
                XJTU-China, NPU-China, and NWU-China held the first iGEM meet-up in north-wets session of China. We shared our projects with each other, and the other two teams shared their experiences with iGEM with us. We keep communicating on the WeChat with all kinds of problem.
              </P><H3>XJTU-China’s aid for conducting DNA Time Capsule</H3><P>
                We helped them contact Mawu Primary School in Xi'an, enabling their DNA Time Capsule activity to be implemented smoothly.
              </P><H3>Standardizations of parts</H3><P>
                Problems occurred while NPU-China tried to construct the plasmid. They failed to ligate 5 fragment onto the vector pSB1C3. So we offered help and successfully construct the plasmid.
                The electrophoretogram are as shown below.

                For dryLab, we collaborate with OUC. With the help of OUC, we set up a hairpin coupling model to describe the coupling coefficient of upstream and downstream expression level. And we model our project to validate the coupling model from OUC.

                As for the device A, we set up an ODE model to describe the concentration change. We share our wetLab data with SYSU to help them test their model and besides they use their CO-RAD model to validate our ODE model. And it works well with two models for device A.
              </P><P>
                The modeling result is shown below.

                We assisted UCAS-China in making their calendar, which will be a gift for the world, with the blessings sent by XJTU-China and dozens of other teams!

                Yuqing Lei is responsible for human practice in iGEM teams UCAS-China in 2017. She has given a great deal of experience and helpness in the HP, which benefit us a lot !

                iGEMers of Jilin-China, USTC, BNU and XJTU-China had a nice meeting in USTC,Hefei. Each team presented their projects and had an extensive discussion about ideas, collaborations details in experiment and modeling, and competition details etc. We learn how to prepare our project and how to present our ideas from the discussion.
