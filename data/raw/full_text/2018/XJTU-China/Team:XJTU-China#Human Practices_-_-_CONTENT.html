We also conducted questionnaires for online and offline surveys. In addition, social practice of IGEM competition is including offering lectures on synthetic biology, visiting nursing homes, and handing out health manuals.

                  In rodents, D-psicose is known to inhibit digestive enzymes, including alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase. D-psicose also inhibits the absorption of glucose from the intestine by competing with glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) on the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells.

                  In rats, D-psicose-induced hepatic glucokinase has been reported to improve hepatic glucose utilization.

                  Rats fed D-psicose had significantly lower serum insulin and leptin levels. The D-psicose diet significantly reduced liver enzyme activity involved in adipogenesis, while gene expression of fatty acid oxidative transcriptional regulators was enhanced.

                  D-psicose is by far a perfect substitute for sucrose, not only in taste, sweetness, calorie, but also in food processing. The most similar sugar to D-psicose is tagatose, but it is more expensive, and its comprehensive characteristics are not as good as D-psicose.
                </LI><LI>
                  Japan is a pioneer for study of D-psicose, and the three companies to commercialize D-psicose worldwide are Matsutani Chemical Industry Co.,Ltd.(JP)，CJ Cheiljedang Crop.(KR) and Tate &amp; Lyle P.L.C (UK)
                </LI><LI>
                  All three commercialized companies for D-psicose use enzymatic production instead of chemical synthesis, which means high activity of key enzyme in D-psicose biosynthesis is essential.

                D-psicose has been approved by FDA in 2011. FDA-related information shows that D-psicose is sufficiently safe to be used in food. In China it is not approved yet.                
                </LI><LI>
                  D-psicose has been industrialized out of China since FDA’s approval, and hundreds of foods have been added with D-psicose as a sweetener.

                  The global market of sugar is more than $10 million per year, of which more than 80% is sucrose. In China, the demand for sucrose is also large and the yield is insufficient.

                 Thanks to Prof. Sun, it can be concluded that D-psicose is safe to be used in food and has unparalleled advantages over other sugar substitutes!

So we are trying to find out the possibility to commercialization of D-psicose in China.

However, more than half said they would mind the use of sweeteners and want their food to have sugar and low energy. </P><P>D-psicose is a natural and healthy sugar, yet little is known about it by public. This sugar with a sweetness of 70%-80% of sucrose, and with low calorie as well as possible positive effect on diabetes. So, when are asked “do you want to buy if D-psicose is added to the food”, about half of them choose &quot;Yes&quot;. Therefore, we believe that D-psicose is promising to be used in food and will have huge market in the future.</P></DIV><DIV id="section4"><DIV class="page-header"><H2>Market analysis summary of D-psicose</H2></DIV><P>
                Based on the survey, we summarized the current beverages on the market and counted the sweeteners used in them.

                By investigating the types of sweeteners in different beverages, we found that most soda drinks use a variety of sweeteners and most of the sweeteners currently used are not as sweet as sucrose. Besides, they can cause dangerous side effects to the human body. In contrast, D-psicose has high sweetness, low calories, and no known side effects, which may be a healthy sweetener. This proves that D-psicose has great advantages in entering the market.
              </P><P>
                The price of D-psicose on Amazon is $12.88, while in China, D-psicose is currently not sold as a sweetener. However, according to our company visits, market professionals told us that d-psicose under 20,000 yuan/ton can be accepted by the market. If D-psicose is added to the beverage as a sweetener, a price of 10 yuan/bottle is acceptable in the market.

                </P><P>iGEMers of Jilin-China, USTC, BNU and XJTU-China had a nice meeting in USTC. Each team presented their projects and had an extensive discussion about ideas, collaborations details in experiment and modeling, and competition details etc. We learn how to prepare our project and how to present our ideas from the discussion.</P><DIV id="section52"><DIV class="page-header"><H3>CCiC</H3></DIV><P style="text-align: right">Location: Shanghai;

                </P><P>As a communication platform for Chinese synthetic biology enthusiasts, CCiC develops in reform and innovation during 5 years. The 5th CCiC was hosted by ShanghaiTech University. There are more than 60 teams participated in the conference, with more than 500 people. During the five-day meeting, we met and communicated with other iGEMers, exchanging our ideas and experience. </P><P>
                Meanwhile, Vice President of iGEM Miss Meagan Lizarazo and some experienced advisors thought highly of our projects, and provided us a lot of valuable advice. We benefit a lot from this meeting, and based on the suggestions, we changed our track to “Manufacturing” and focus more on D-psicose.  </P><DIV id="section53"><DIV class="page-header"><H3>Xi'an meetup</H3></DIV><P style="text-align: right">Location: NPU, Shannxi;

                </P><P>This summer, three teams in Shaanxi came together and shared their thoughts in the first stage of the iGEM season. It was a great chance for us to share the sparks we had in brainstorming and the obstacles we met during lab (especially in InterLab, by then), to share the resources we have, and to talk about the experiences we had in building up the team and managing all the experiments
                </P><P>
                  During the meetup, we all shared our conceptions of iGEM projects. After it, NPU and NWU teams have shared their experiences in attending the Giant Jamboree. We have learned some very useful tips in Boston. At last, we shared our thoughts about how to pass our knowledge to younger iGEMers, and how to involve them in our current labs, so that they will be familiar to the protocols when building up a team of themselves.
                </P><P>
                  In summary, it is very important to meet and collaborate with other teams, sharing wonderful ideas and solving the problems together.

                Our product, D-psicose, can be used as a sweetener and has certain medical value. In order to fully understand it, we have done a lot of related work. The communication with experts offered us a opportunity to deep understand the value of D-psicose. To know more about the current market,we visited several companies .Undoubtly，it is important for us to communicate with the elderly and diabetic patients, ,which let us understand the current market demand. Besides, meeting up with other IGEM teams to exchanges and cooperation has caused us to spark new sparks in the study of D-psicose
