Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
Materials:
agarose        0.25g TAE            25mL GelRed         2uL 6× Gel loading Dye   DNA marker     4ul
Methods:
Heat the mixture until no particle can be seen.
Add GelRed when the temperature drops to around 55℃.
Pour the solution into the gel casting tray with appreciate comb.
Place the gel in the electrophoresis chamber and add enough TAE Buffer.
Add 6× Gel loading Dye into the samples and load them.   130V, 15min of electrophoresis.
Staining and visualization.
Notes:
The concentration of gel affects the resolution of DNA separation. For a standard agarose gel electrophoresis, a 0.8% gives good separation or resolution of large 5–10kb DNA fragments, while 2% gel gives good resolution for small 0.2–1kb fragments. 1% gels is often used for a standard electrophoresis.

Methods:
Keep materials at room temperature (22-30℃) for 1-5 min.
Notes:
The materials should not be put on ice after ligation.
The PCR product should use taq DNA polymerase. Otherwise they should be added into the taq DNA polymerase system and incubate in 37℃ for 10min.
BioBrick Ligation
Materials:
Linear vector DNA        20-100ng Insert DNA               5:1molar ratio over vector 10× T4 DNA Ligase Buffer 2uL T4 DNA Ligase            1 Weiss U ddH2O                    up to 20uL Total volume             20uL
Methods:
Incubate 10 min at 22℃.
Use up to 5uL of the mixture for transformation of 50uL of chemically competent cells or 1-2uL per 50uL of electrocompetent cells.
Notes:
The electrotransformation efficiency may be improved by:
Heat inactivation of T4 DNA ligase at 65℃ for 10 min or at 70℃ for 5 min.
Purification of DNA.
The overall number of transformants may be increased by extending the reaction time to 1 hour.
If more than 2 Weiss U of T4 DNA ligase is used in 20uL reaction mixture, it is necessary to purify DNA before electrotransformation.

Gel purification with Tiangen Gel Extraction kit
Materials:
Buffer BL Buffer PN Buffer PW Buffer EB Spin columns CA2 2mL Collection Tubes
Methods:
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean shaver blade;
Weigh the gel slice in a 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 1 volumes of Buffer PN to the same volume of gel (0.1g gel slice is treated as100μL buffer PN).
Incubate at 65°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). To help dissolve gel, mix by inverting the tube several times every 2–3 min during the incubation.
Add 500μl buffer BL to a column, centrifuge at 12000rpm for 1 min and discard flow through before use to maximally activate the column.
After the gel slice has dissolved completely, wait until the sample returns to room temperature and apply the sample to the column, let stand for 2min; Centrifuge at 1200rpm for 1 min and discard the flow-through.
Wash the column by adding 600μl buffer PW and centrifuging for 60s. Discard the flow-through.
Repeat the last step.
Centrifuge for 2 min to remove the residual wash buffer.
Place the column in a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube and add 30-40μl ddH2O to the center of the column; Let stand for 2min and centrifuge for 2min; (If necessary, repeat this step).

Plasmid extraction
Purification of plasmid using TIANGEN pure low copy plasmid kit
Materials:
Buffer BL buffer P1 Buffer P2 Buffer P3 Buffer PW Spin columns CP3 2mL Collection Tubes
Methods:
Column equilibration: Place a Spin Column CP3 in a clean collection tube, and add 500 μl Buffer BL to CP3. Centrifuge for 1 min at 12,000 rpm (~13,400 × g) in a table-top microcentrifuge. Discard the flow-through and set the Spin Column CP3 back into the collection tube.
Harvest 1-5 ml bacterial cells in a microcentrifuge tube by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm (~13,400× g) in a conventional, table-top microcentrifuge for 1 min at room temperature (15-25°C), then remove all traces of supernatant by inverting the open centrifuge tube until all medium has been drained.
Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 μl Buffer P1. Note: Ensure that RNase A has been added to Buffer P1. No cell clumps should be visible after resuspension of the pellet.
Add 250 μl Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 6-8 times. Note: Mix gently by inverting the tube. Do not vortex, as this will result in shearing of genomic DNA. If necessary, continue inverting the tube until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed for more than 5 min. If the lysate is still not clear, please reduce bacterial pellet.
Add 350 μl Buffer P3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 6-8 times. The solution should become cloudy. Note: To avoid localized precipitation, mix the solution thoroughly, immediately after addition of Buffer P3.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 12,000 rpm (~13,400× g) in a table-top microcentrifuge. A compact white pellet will form.
Carefully transfer the supernatant from step 6 to the Filtration Columns CS (place the CS in a collection tube) by decanting or pipetting. Centrifuge for 2 min at 12,000 rpm (~13,400× g). Note: Avoid pipetting out the precipitate.
Transfer the flow-through in the collection tube to the Spin Column CP3 by decanting or pipetting. Centrifuge for 1 min at 12,000 rpm (~13,400× g). Discard the flow-through and set the Spin Column CP3 back into the Collection Tube.
Recommended: Wash the Spin Column CP3 by adding 500 µl Buffer PD and centrifuging for 1 min at 12,000 rpm (~13,400× g). Discard the flow-through and set the CP3 back into the Collection Tube. Note: This step is necessary to remove trace nuclease activity when using end A+ strains such as the JM series, HB101 and its derivatives, or any wild-type strain, which have high levels of nuclease activity or high carbohydrate content.
Wash the Spin Column CP3 by adding 600 µl Buffer PW (ensure the ethanol (96%-100%) has been added to Buffer PW) and centrifuging for 1 min at 12,000 rpm (~13,400× g). Discard the flow-through and set the CP3 back into the Collection Tube.
Wash Spin Column CP3 by adding 600 µl Buffer PW and centrifuging for 1 min at 12,000 rpm (~13,400× g).
Discard the flow-through, and centrifuge for an additional 2 min at 12,000 rpm (~13,400× g) to remove residual wash buffer PW. Note: Residual wash buffer will not be completely removed unless the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation. We suggest open CP3 lid and stay at room temperature for a while. Residual ethanol from Buffer PW may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions.
Place the Spin Column CP3 in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. To elute DNA, add 30-50 μl water (pH 7.0-8.5) to the center of the Spin Column CP3, let stand for 2-5 min, and then centrifuge for 2 min at 12,000 rpm (~13,400×g)
Notes:
Add the provided Rnase A solution to buffer P1, mix and store at 2-8℃
Check Buffer BL, P2 and P3 before use for salt precipitation. If necessary, dissolve the buffer by warming at 37 ℃ for several minutes.
Avoid direct contact Buffer P2 and P3, immediately close the lid after use.
All centrifugation steps are carried out at 12000rpm(~13,400×g) in table-tap microcentrifuge at room temperature (15-25℃)
After treated with Buffer BL, use the Spin column soon, otherwise long-term placement may affect the purifying effect.
Add ethanol to Buffer PW before use, check bottle tag for the adding volume.

Components I III and V need to be sterilized at 121°C separately to prevent reaction between component.
