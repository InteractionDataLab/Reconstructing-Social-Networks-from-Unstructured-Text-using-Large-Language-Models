The main process of psicose manufacture is catalyzed by D-psicose 3-epimerase. The models of device A, B, C and D are as follows.</P><P>In device A, extracellular concentration of $psicose$ is higher than the intracellular concentration, so it can enter the cells by diffusion. As a small molecular, the $psicose$ inside the cell can be combined with $pPsiR$ to generate $CCI$. $pPsiR$ is a repressor, which can bind to promoters on DNA and block gene expression. After binding with $psicode$,$pPsiR$ falls off from the promoter and the gene starts expressing, And eventually produce the produce $EGFP$.</P><P>For device A, the dynamic equation can be listed as follows:</P><P>Concentrations of A and B are different inside and outside the cell, so the diffusion rate of $psicose$ is proportional to the concentration difference between inside and outside of the cells.</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[PsiO]}{ \text{d}t}V_{outside}=-\gamma_F([PsiO]-[PsiI])$$</P><P>Where $\gamma_F$ is the diffusion coefficient.</P><P>Consider the external solution as an infinitely solution, which means $V_{outside}\rightarrow\infty$ , so</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[PsiO]}{ \text{d}t}=0$$</P><P>When reducer psicose combines with repressor, the process is</P><P>$$PsiI+pPsiR\rightarrow CCI$$</P><P>Where $PsiI$ is the intracellular $psicose$, $pPsiR$ is $psicose$ dependent repressor and $CCI$ is $psicose$-repressor complex. The change in concentration of $PsiI$ï¼Œ$pPsiR$ and $CCI$ contains three influencing factors: the binding reaction of $pPsiR$ and $psicose$, and the degradation reaction of themselves and the reverse reaction. Here we consider the binding reaction as a second order reaction and the degradation reaction and reverse reaction as first order reactions. According to law of mass action, reaction rate is proportional to the product of the reactant concentration, so we have</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[PsiI]}{\text{d}t}=\frac{-\gamma_F([PsiI]-[PsiO])}{V_{cell}}-m_{pPsiR,Psi}[PsiI][pPsiR]+m_{CCI}[CCI]-\delta_{PsiI}[PsiI]$$</P><P>And considering $pPsiR$ is constantly expressing, we can get</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[pPsiR]}{\text{d}t}=\alpha_{pPsiR}-m_{pPsiR,Psi}[PsiI][pPsiR]+m_{CCI}[CCI]-\delta_{pPsiR}[pPsiR]$$</P><P>Where $m_{pPsiR,Psi}$ is the coefficient of reaction rate of the binding reaction, $\alpha_{pPsiR}$ is the rate of constant expression of $pPsiR$, $\delta_{pPsiR}$ and $\delta_{PsiI}$ are coefficients of reaction rate of the degradation reaction of $pPsiR$ and $PsicoseI$ respectively.</P><P>The concentration of inactivated repressor is</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[CCI]}{\text{d}t}=m_{pPsiR,Psi}[PsiI][pPsiR]+m_{CCI}[CCI]-\delta_{CCI}[CCI]$$</P><P>The change in $EGFP$ concentration depends on the concentration of its repressor,  $pPsiR$ which can be described by Hill-equation. Considering $EGFP$ is also degrading, the equation is</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[EGFP]}{\text{d}t}=H\frac{\beta_{EGFP}K^n}{K^n+[pPsiR]^n} -\delta_{EGFP}[EGFP]$$</P><P>Where $n$ is hill coefficient, $K$ is the ligand concentration producing half occupation, $\beta_{EGFP}$ is maximal transcription rate of gene $EGFP$, and $H$ is a constant used to indicate the deviation between the theoretical and actual values.</P><P>In device B, extracellular concentration of $IPTG$ is higher than which is intracellular, so it can enter the cells by diffusion. As a small molecular, the $IPTG$ inside the cell can be combined with $pLacR$ to generate $CC$. $pLacR$ is a repressor, which can bind to promoters on DNA and block gene expression. After binding with $IPTG$, $pLacR$ falls off from the promoter and the gene starts expressing, And eventually produce the produce $EGFP$. Since the gene of $ABR$ and the gene of $EGFP$ are connected in series, they are expressed together.</P><P>Similarly, we can get the function of device B by using the reaction rate equation and the diffusion function. First,</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[IPTGO]}{\text{d}t}=0$$</P><P>According to the reaction between $IPTGI$ and $pLacR$ and the reaction rate equation, we can get</P><P>$$IPTGI+pLacR\rightarrow CC$$</P><P>This reaction is similar with the reaction in device A, so we have</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[IPTGI]}{\text{d}t}=\frac{-\gamma_{IPTG}([IPTGI]-[IPTGO])}{V_{cell}}-m_{IPTG,pLacR}[IPTGI][pLacR]+m_{CC}[CC]-\delta_{IPTG}[IPTGI]$$</P><P>Similarly, we can also get</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[pLacR]}{\text{d}t}=\alpha_{pLacR}-m_{IPTG,pLacR}[IPTGI][pLacR]+m_{CC}[CC]-\delta_{pLacR}[pLacR]$$</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[CC]}{\text{d}t}=-m_{IPTG,pLacR}[IPTGI][pLacR]+m_{CC}[CC]-\delta_{CC}[CC]$$</P><P>And $pLac$ is a transcription activator of gene $EGFP$, according to hill equation, the concentration of $EGFP$ is </P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[EGFP]}{\text{d}t}=H\frac{\beta_{EGFP}K^n}{K^n+[pLacR]^n} -\delta_{EGFP} [EGFP] $$</P><P>The concentration of $EGFP$ is the same as the concentration of antibiotics resistance due to the transcription and translation of antibiotic resistance gene combined with the gene of $EGFP$.</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[EGFP]}{\text{d}t}=\frac{\text{d}[ABR]}{\text{d}t}$$</P><P>Where $[EGFP]$ is the concentration of $EGFP$ and $[ABR]$ is the concentration of antibiotic resistance protein expression.</P><P>Device C is the same with device B.

After $IPTG$ binding with $pLacR$, $DTE$ starts to express, and as an enzyme, to catalysis $fructose$ to turn into $psicose$. As more and more $psicose$ are produced, more and more the repressor of gene $EGFP$, $pLacR$ are inactivated, so expression of $EGPF$ increase. At the same time, expression of $ABR$ also increase since the gene of $ABR$ and the gene of $EGFP$ are connected in series by a hairpin.</P><P>For device D, $psicose$ and $fuctose$ get in cells by diffusion:</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[PsiO]}{\text{d}t}=\frac{-\gamma_{F}([PsiO]-[PsiI])}{V_{outside}}=0 $$</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[FO]}{\text{d}t}=\frac{-\gamma_{F}([FO]-[FI])}{V_{outside}}=0$$</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[IPTGO]}{\text{d}t}=\frac{-\gamma_{F}([IPTGO]-[IPTGI])}{V_{outside}}=0$$</P><P>And device D consists of device A and device C connected by an extra step:</P><P>$$FI\underrightarrow{DTE}PsiI$$</P><P>This reaction is an enzyme catalyzed reaction, which can be described by Michaelis equation, so we can get the following equations:</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[FI]}{\text{d}t}=\frac{-\gamma_{F}([FI]-[FO])}{V_{cell}}-\frac{k_2[DTE][FI]}{K_M+[FI]}-\delta_{FI}[FI]$$</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[PsiI]}{\text{d}t}=\frac{-\gamma_{F}([PsiI]-[PsiO])}{V_{cell}}+\frac{k_2[DTE][FI]}{K_M+[FI]}-\delta_{PsiI}[PsiI]$$</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[IPTGI]}{\text{d}t}=\frac{-\gamma_{IPTG}([IPTGI]-[IPTGO])}{V_{cell}}+m_{IPTG,pLacR}[IPTGI][pLacR]-\delta_{IPTG}[IPTGI]$$</P><P>Where $k_2$ is reaction rate coefficient of transition state productâ€™s decomposition reaction, $K_M$ is the Michaelis contant.</P><P>The rest of the equations are the same with which in device A and device C:</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[pLacR]}{\text{d}t}=\alpha_{pLacR}-m_{IPTG,pLacR}[IPTGI][pLacR]+m_{CC}[CC]-\delta_{pLacR}[pLacR]$$</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[pPsiR]}{\text{d}t}=\alpha_{pPsiR}-m_{pPsiR,PsiI}[pPsiR][PsiI]+m_{CCI}[CCI]-\delta_{pLacR}[pLacR]$$</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[pPsiR]}{\text{d}t}=\alpha_{pPsiR}-m_{pPsiR,Psi}[PsiI][pPsiR]+m_{CCI}[CCI]-\delta_{pPsiR}[pPsiR]$$</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[CC]}{\text{d} t}=m_{IPTG,pLacR}[PsiI][pPsiR]-m_{CC}[CC]-\delta_{CC}[CC]$$</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[CCI]}{\text{d} t}=m_{pSiR}[PsiI][pPsiR]-m_{CCI}[CCI]-\delta_{CCI}[CCI]$$</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[DTE]}{\text{d}t}=H\frac{\beta_{EGFP}K^n}{K^n+[pLacR]^n}-\delta_{DTE}[DTE]$$</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[EGFP]}{\text{d}t}=H\frac{\beta_{EGFP}K^n}{K^n+[pPsiR]^n}-\delta_{EGFP}[EGFP]$$</P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}[ABR]}{\text{d}t}=k\frac{\text{d}[EGFP]}{\text{d}t}$$</P></DIV><DIV class="page-header" id="section3"><H2>Production and Conversion Rate Simulink Model</H2><DIV align="center"><H3>The Establishment of Production and Conversion Rate Simulink Model</H3></DIV><P>To understand how we get psicose in a deep view, replication, transcription and translation are involved to describe the synthesis of psicose and thus come to our production on a large scale. As we all know, the enzyme will degrade due to the mutation of coding sequence during DNA replication and the transcription error. Although the rate mutation and transcription error are one in 100 million and one in 10 thousand, the yield of psicose may not decrease because even errors happen in the process of replication and transcription, the type and order of amino acid may not reverse as well as the function of our enzyme which lead to the same catalytic rate of the original one.</P><P>However, the butterfly effect tells us that we cannot ignore the small change in our system, even it is little enough for us to ignore. Considering the mutation rate and transcription error, the production of psicose is closely related to the cycling times, error rate and original production. The production of psicose is a function with variables of cycling times, error rate and original production.</P><P>$$Prd(t)=Prd(t,Times,errRate,oriPrd)$$</P><P>Where Times is the cycling times of psicose, errRate is the rate of replication and transcription error, oriPrd is the original production of our system.</P><P>The errRate is influenced by the replication error rate and the transcription error rate. Meantime, the more replication and transcription errors we get, the lower or higher production we will get. The error rate function is </P><P>$$errRate(t)=repRat(t)\cdot trsRat(t)$$</P><P>Where the replication error rate depends on the length of D-psicose 3-epimerase coding sequence, the multiplication of single error rate define the replication and transcription rate as follows</P><P>$$repRat(t)=srepRat^{len}(t)$$</P><P>The length of mRNA is one third of the cDNA length, here we get</P><P>$$trsRat(t)=\sqrt[3]{strsRat^{len}(t)}$$</P><P>Although errors can result in the decrease of production, the increase of production is also promoting on account of the uncertainty of variation. For a natural evolution system, we consider that the probability of production decrease and increase is equal, decided by the error rate per cycling period. Therefore, the average production growth rate is distributed normally with the mean of 0 and the variance of error rate. The production growth rate is shown as follows </P><P>$$grsRate~N(0,errRate)$$</P><P>If we set X as production growth rate,$\sigma^2$ as error rate, then we will get</P><P>$X ~{}N(0,\sigma^2)$ </P><P>And the probability density function is </P><P>$$f(x\mid 0,\sigma^2)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$</P><P>The probability of production growth rate is </P><P>$$P(x_1 &lt; grsRat &lt; x_2)=F(x_2)-F(x_1)=\int_{x_1}^{x_2}f(x)dx$$</P><P>The original production is also vital when we simulate the production of our system by reason that the larger our system is, the more psicose we will get in our manufacturing and it makes no sense to compare a certain system with another in a totally different scale. So the standardization and the estimation of original production for psicose is necessary.</P><P>There are many variables which have impacts on the original production, such as the quantity of E.coli, the growth rate of E.coli, the conversion rate of psicose and the total amount of substrate which determines the scale of the production system. The original production rate is as follows </P><P>$$\frac{\text{d}oriPrd}{\text{d}t}=N\alpha C_{sub}$$</P><P>Where $oriPrd$ is the original production of the psicose production system, $N$ is the number of E.coli in the system, $\alpha$ is the conversion rate for D-psicose 3-epimerase, $C_{sub}$ is the concentration of substrate, which represents the concentration of fructose in our production system for psicose.</P><P>As for the growth of E.coli, we use Logistic equation to describe the process of E.coli proliferating.</P><P>$$\frac{\text(d)N}{\text{d}t}=r_1N(1-\frac{N}{r_2})$$</P><P>Meanwhile, the concentration of substrate is changing during the process of fermentation in our psicose-production system. We assume the concentration of substrate changes little and can be processed as a constant in order to simplify our process and to find out the discipline of production change, as well as simulating our system in directed evolution method. The concentration of substrate is as follows</P><P>$$C_{sub}\approx C_{sub}(t_0)=constant$$</P><P>In this way, we can get the original production of psicose from the very beginning. The original production of psicose can be calculated as a constant as below</P><P>$$oriPrd=\lim_{t_0\rightarrow 0}\int_0^{t_0}\alpha N(t)C_{sub}(t)dt$$</P><P>Finally, based on the probability distribution function, the variation of production is defined and we can compare the psicose production in natural system and directed evolution system.</P></DIV><DIV class="page-header" id="section4"><H2>Microfludics Model</H2><DIV align="center"><H3>The Establishment of Microfludics Model</H3></DIV><P>In our Lab tour, we find that it is extremely complicated to use pipette to prepare and transfer solutions, especially gradient concentration solutions. High throughput methods to get the gradient concentration of solutions are well needed. In this case, we made a hardware by using the principle of microfluidics and then we simulate it whether it can give us different concentration by using the microfluidics device before the microfluidics chip is finally made. To get the downstream concentration of high concentration and low concentration, particle collision is used to demonstrate the downstream concentration.</P><P>When the fluid flows into the vertical channel of the microfluidics chip, the number of the solute is equal and both are half of the original quantity. In this case, the concentration of the both sides or both directions are the same with the half original concentration.</P><P>$$m_3=m_4=\frac{1}{2}m_1\qquad m_5=m_6=\frac{1}{2}m_2$$</P><P>$$n_3=n_4=\frac{1}{2}n_1\qquad n_5=n_6=\frac{1}{2}n_2$$</P><P>$$c_3=c_4=c_1\qquad c_5=c_6=c_2$$</P><P>When the liquid flows to the corner of the channels, the momentum is considered as a constant due to the orthogonal relation between the vertical channel and the horizontal channel.
