Instructors
We would like to take this opportunities to say thanks to our instructors, Mr. Kelvin K.F. Shek, Mr. Paul P. Lau, Mr. Caleb K.H. Wong and Mr. Tim K.C. Fan for giving project support and advice, lab support and difficult technique support
Achievement by our teammates
Part design
We obtained the sequence from NCBi and iGEM library, we did codon optimization and reverse transcription. After that, we designed the composite parts.
UCCKE: Nathan Ip, Sean Yam, Rosa Lai, Owen Hsiu , Gabriel Lee, Hannah Luk
TKP: Sharon Fong, Bowie Wong, Andy Tse
Collaboration
We contacted Team Hong_Kong_CUHK and Team Hong_Kong_UST for collaboration.
UCCKE: Jonathan Cheng, Sean Yam, Nathan Ip, Owen Hsiu
TKP: Bowie Wong, Lily Lau, Dolphin Chan
Human Practice/ Public Engagement
We involved the society to obtain ideas to improve for our project by collecting water samples and doing interviews. We also keep on promoting iGEM and synthetic biology to other schools in Hong Kong.

Idea and project design
Based on our inspiration on heavy metal pollution over the world, we designed a new approach to solve the problem by metallothionein and synthetically biological techniques.

Product design
We tried to make our project into a working product which can achieve the goals of our approach
PLKCHC: Suki Chan, Louis Kwong, Xyrace Tse, Eric Chu, Tran Do Giang My
3D modeling
After designing the product, we used 3D printing to create a prototype of the device

Pilot test run
In order to prove that our device is functional on absorbing copper ions from aqueous medium, we selected some of our members to undergo a pilot test.

Presentation coaching
Treating students sternly is always the action of showing love by teachers. The mentors of HKJSS team coach us with their deepest love, gradually improve our presentation skills and organising ability. We would like to express our greatest thanks to our team mentors, who spent their days and nights to lead us to flourish.
