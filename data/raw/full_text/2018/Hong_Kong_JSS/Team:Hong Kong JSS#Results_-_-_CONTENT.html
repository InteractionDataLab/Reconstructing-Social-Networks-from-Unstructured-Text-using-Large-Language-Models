We figured that shops in Goldfish market usually monitor their water quality in order to keep fishes healthy. Moreover, when the heavy metal concentration in water is too high, shopkeepers will use bio-rings to remove the excess heavy metal. They will also use heavy metal precipitating agent after replacing water. But the procedures of replacing water is complicated as they need to relocate large number of fishes.That is why not many shopkeepers prefer to use replacing water as a method to remove excess heavy metal. As shopkeepers monitor the water quality regularly, shops have lower copper concentration than in households. </P><H2>Assay 2 : Absorption spectrum of copper solution after adding API copper test solution </H2><H3>Abstract of assay</H3><P>In a high school labobatory, we do not have any specialised equipments for testing copper concentration directly.

The test was repeated twice to obtain an average value of the absorbance value. An equation was generated to estimate the concentration of copper ions in SOB medium from absorbance at 440 nm. y = 0.0939x + 0.186. y is absorbance of solution in 440 nm while x is the  concentration of copper solution in SOB medium.  The result of the standard curve shows a linear relationship between absorbance and copper concentration. When the copper concentration increases, the absorbance increases. Water is used as blank reference. The absorbance of SOB medium without copper ions is 0.19 because SOB medium is yellow in color. In assay 4, SOB medium is used for culture medium. Therefore, it is essential to study the relationship between absorbance and copper conconcentartion in SOB medium background. The result show that SOB medium will not affect the linear relationship between absorbance and copper concentration in 0 to 10 mg/L range. </P><H2>Assay 4 : test for copper absorption ability of engineered <I>E.coli</I></H2><H3>Abstract of assay 4A</H3><P>In preparation of this assay, transformed <I>E.coli</I> with MT plasmids (<I>Homo sapiens</I> and <I>Elsholtzia haichowensis</I> MT1 gene) and plasmid vector without insert (as control setup), are inoculated as <I>E.coli</I> colonies and incubated for another 18 hours in SOB medium.
