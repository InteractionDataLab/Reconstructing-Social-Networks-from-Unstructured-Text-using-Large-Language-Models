Firstly, as we hope our result is beneficial and useful to the society, we performed Assay 1 to find out the range of concentration of copper ions in the water we use daily. Then, we used assay 2 to determine which copper concentration, wavelength of filter and colorimeter will generate the best results. After that, we made our standard curve by assay 3 so that we can use it to estimate the change in concentration of copper in assay 4. We also conducted assay 5 and assay 6 to test the feasibility of the device that we proposed which the designs of our assays will be discussed detailedly below. </P><H2>Assay 1 : Heavy metal test of water sample collected from Goldfish Market and households</H2><H3>Abstract of assay	</H3><P>Measuring the copper concentration of water sample collected from Goldfish Market and households with the aid of Salifert Copper Test Kit.</P><H3>Aim of Experiment </H3><P>To know the copper concentration of both water samples from households and Goldfish Market, and determine the seriousness of copper pollution problem in Hong Kong.</P><H3>Protocols</H3><OL><LI>Add 2 mL of water sample into Salifert Profit test kit test vial.</LI><LI>Add 5 drops of the Salifert Profit Copper reagent to the test vial and swirl gently for 5 seconds.</LI><LI>Allow to stand for 10 minutes .</LI><LI>Hold the test vial in front of eyes, compare the colour of solution in the test vial with the colour chart provided by the Salifert copper test kit.</LI></OL><P class="pho">Colour Chart</P><H3>Reference</H3><OL><P><LI>About Salifert Copper Test Kit: </LI></P><P><A href="https://www.marinedepot.com/test_kits_salifert_copper_information-ap.html">https://www.marinedepot.com/test_kits_salifert_copper_information-ap.html&quot;</A></P></OL><H2>Assay 2 : Absorption spectrum of copper solution after adding API copper test solution</H2><H3>Abstract of assay</H3><P>In a high school labobatory, we do not have any specialised equipments for testing copper concentration directly.

</LI><LI>Thaw competent cells on ice, this may take 10-15 minutes for a 260µl stock. Dispose of unused competent cells. Do not refreeze unused thawed cells, as it will drastically reduce transformation efficiency.
</LI><LI>Pipette 50µl of competent cells into 1.5 ml tube, 50µl in a 1.5ml tube per transformation. Tubes should be labeled, pre-chilled, and in a floating tube rack for support. Keep all tubes on ice. Don’t forget a 1.5ml tube for your control.

</LI><LI>Pipette 100 µL of each transformation onto petri plates Spread with sterilized spreader or glass beads immediately. This helps ensure that you will be able to pick out a single colony.
</LI><LI>Spin down cells at 6800g for 3 minutes and discard 800 µL of the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in the remaining 100 µL, and pipette each transformation onto petri plates, spread with sterilized spreader or glass beads immediately. This increases the chance of getting colonies from lower concentration DNA samples.
</LI><LI>Incubate transformations overnight (14-18 hours) at 37°C,  incubate the plates upside down (agar side up). If incubated for too long, colonies may overgrow and the antibiotics may start to break down; un-transformed cells will begin to grow.
</LI><LI>Pick single colonies: Pick single colonies from transformations: do a colony PCR to verify part size, make glycerol stocks, grow up cell cultures and miniprep.</LI></OL><H3>Reference </H3><OL><LI>Restriction Digestion : </LI><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Help:Protocols/Restriction_Digest">http://parts.igem.org/Help:Protocols/Restriction_Digest</A><A href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/146gJ1lDpryZF4geOJkIYtExIa0tkdQAE/view?usp=sharing ">https://drive.google.com/file/d/146gJ1lDpryZF4geOJkIYtExIa0tkdQAE/view?usp=sharing</A><LI>DNA purification from gel Invitrogen™ PureLink™ Quick Gel Extraction Kit :</LI><A href="https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/purelink_quick_gel_extraction_kit_qrc.pdf">https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/purelink_quick_gel_extraction_kit_qrc.pdf</A><LI>Ligation	 :  </LI><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Help:Protocols/Ligation">http://parts.igem.org/Help:Protocols/Ligation</A><LI>Single tube transformation :</LI><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Help:Protocols/Transformation">http://parts.igem.org/Help:Protocols/Transformation</A><LI>Miniprep using the Invitrogen™ PureLink™ Quick Plasmid Miniprep Kit :</LI><A href="https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/purelink_quick_plasmid_qrc.pdf">https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/purelink_quick_plasmid_qrc.pdf</A></OL></DIV><DIV class="pre"><CENTER><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Hong_Kong_JSS/Design"><DIV class="arrow" style="display: inline-block">〈</DIV><DIV style="display: inline-block; text-align:left">Previous:  Design </DIV></A></CENTER></DIV><DIV class="nex"><CENTER><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Hong_Kong_JSS/Results"><DIV style="display: inline-block; text-align:left">Next:  Results </DIV><DIV class="arrow" style="display: inline-block">〉</DIV></A></CENTER></DIV><DIV class="sand"><DIV class="san"><DIV class="sana"><DIV class="sanda"><H2>Hong Kong JSS</H2></DIV><DIV class="sandb"><H3>Contact</H3><P>hkjsigem@gmail.com</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
