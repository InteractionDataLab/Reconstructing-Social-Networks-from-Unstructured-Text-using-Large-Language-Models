Assay
In order to design suitable experiments and to test the effectiveness of our bacteria, we carry out five assays. Firstly, as we hope our result is beneficial and useful to the society, we performed Assay 1 to find out the range of concentration of copper ions in the water we use daily. Then, we used assay 2 to determine which copper concentration, wavelength of filter and colorimeter will generate the best results. After that, we made our standard curve by assay 3 so that we can use it to estimate the change in concentration of copper in assay 4. We also conducted assay 5 and assay 6 to test the feasibility of the device that we proposed which the designs of our assays will be discussed detailedly below.
Assay 1 : Heavy metal test of water sample collected from Goldfish Market and households

Assay 2 : Absorption spectrum of copper solution after adding API copper test solution
Abstract of assay
In a high school labobatory, we do not have any specialised equipments for testing copper concentration directly. Moreover, using naked eye and color chart of testing kits to determine the copper concentration is not accurate enough for our purpose. Therefore, we modified the protocol and using 2 colorimeter to measure the absorbance of reaction mixture.
Aim of Experiment
The aim of these trials is finding the optimal wavelength of filter in colorimeter and concentration range of copper(II) sulphate aqueous solution after copper testing kit treatment. These settings and initial concentration were selected for performing assay 3 and 4.
Protocols
Test 1. Absorption spectrum of 10 mg/L copper solution
Prepare 10 mg/L Copper solution from Copper(II) sulphate powder.
Transfer 5 ml Copper solution to a test tube.
Add 10 drops of API Copper testing solution into the copper solution.
Wait 30 seconds.
Transfer 2.5 ml of the reaction mixture into a clean cuvette. Insert the cuvette into colorimeter.
Measure the absorption spectrum of the solution at different wavelength by colorimeter No. 6 and No. 9.
Test 2. Absorbance of copper solution at different concentration
Label four test tubes 1 mg/L, 2 mg/L,  3 mg/L, 4 mg/L, 10 mg/L.
Add 4.5, 4, 3.5, 3 ml of distilled water into the test tubes respectively.
Add 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 ml of copper into the test tubes respectively. Add 175 ul of API Copper ions testing solution into each tube.
Wait 30 seconds.
Measure the absorbance of each solution (in cuvette) by using colorimeter.
To further improve the accuracy and consistency of future experiments, the unit of API test solution has been changed from 5 drops to 175 ul which is approximately the same volume. Because using drops has a larger error than using micropipette when dripping.

Assay 5 : Test for the permeability of dialysis tubing
Abstract of assay
We designed a bacterial copper filtration device which can circulate E. coli culture inside dialysis tubing. We believe that due to the pore size of dialysis tubing, bacteria cannot move across the tubing while copper ion can, thus allowing the bacteria to absorb copper ion in water without letting the transgenic bacteria out to the environment.
Aim of Experiment
Confirm copper ion can pass through the dialysis tubing
Confirm E. coli cannot pass through the dialysis tubing

Assay 6 : Testing the cardboard colorimeter
Abstract of assay
In this experiment, we used standard copper (II) solutions to test the reliability of the cardboard colorimeter. The measurement was taken using iphoneX with an iOS Apps “ColorMeter”. Other smartphone (iOS or android) with camera and similar color identification Apps can also be used. In this experiment, since we are detecting an orange color change, a contrasting blue background is used and we will be monitoring the change in blue intensity of the RGB color codes. The absorbance of the solution were calculated by the fomular A = Log10 (I0/I) under Beer’s rule.
Aim of Experiment

Plasmid Cloning
Composite part cloning
Abstract
As we ordered our plasmid by custom gene synthesis, which the backbone of the plasmid is pUCIDT (Amp), we did miniprep to obtain the plasmid and did cloning after we conducted assays 1-5. To ligate our gene of interest, MymT producing gene (BBa_K2578410),  EhMT1 producing gene (BBa_K2578610) and MT1A producing gene (BBa_K2578810), with the pSB1C3 backbone, which is the shipping standard backbone, we first did restriction enzyme digestion on the ordered plasmid and pSB1C3 backbone by using Pst1 and EcoR1, then we did gel extraction followed by gel purification, and ligate the gene of interest with the pSB1C3 backbone. After that, we transformed that to E.coli and obtain the DNA by miniprep.
Aim
To ligate the gene of interest with the standard backbone pSB1C3, in order to meet the requirement of part submission.

Purification Procedure Using Centrifugation
Centrifuge 5 mL of the overnight LB-culture. Remove all medium.
Add 250 μL Resuspension Buffer (R3) with RNase A to the cell pellet and resuspend the pellet until it is homogeneous.
Add 250 μL Lysis Buffer (L7). Mix gently by inverting the capped tube until the mixture is homogeneous. Do not vortex. Incubate the tube at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Add 350 μL Precipitation Buffer (N4). Mix immediately by inverting the tube, or for large pellets, vigorously shaking the tube, until the mixture is homogeneous. Do not vortex. Centrifuge the lysate at >12,000 × g for 10 minutes.
Load the supernatant from step 4 onto a spin column in a 2-mL wash tube. Centrifuge the column at 12,000 × g for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and place the column back into the wash tube.
(OP) Add 500 μL Wash Buffer (W10) with ethanol to the column. Incubate the column for 1 minute at room temperature. Centrifuge the column at 12,000 × g for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and place column back into the wash tube.
Add 700 μL Wash Buffer (W9) with ethanol to the column. Centrifuge the column at 12,000 × g for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and place the column into the wash tube. Centrifuge the column at 12,000 × g for 1 minute. Discard the wash tube with the flow-through.
Place the Spin Column in a clean 1.5-mL recovery tube. Add 75 μL of preheated TE Buffer (TE) to the center of the column. Incubate the column for 1 minute at room temperature.
Centrifuge the column at 12,000 × g for 2 minutes (the recovery tube contains the purified plasmid DNA). Discard the column. Store plasmid DNA at 4°C (short-term) or store the DNA in aliquots at −20°C (long-term).
Restriction enzyme digestion
Prepare one 8-tube strip, BioBrick Part in BioBrick plasmid (Purified DNA, > 16ng/ul), dH2O, NEB Buffer 2, BSA and Restriction Enzymes: EcoRI, PstI.
Add 250 ng of DNA to be digested, and adjust with dH20 for a total volume of 16ul to every reaction.
Add 2.5ul of NEBuffer 2 to every reaction.
Add 0.5ul of BSA to every reaction.
Add 0.5ul of EcoRI to every reaction.
Add 0.5ul of PstI to every reaction.
There should be a total volume of 20 ul of solution in every reaction. Mix well and spin down briefly.
Incubate the restriction digest at 37°C for 30 minutes, and then 80°C for 20 minutes to heat kill the enzymes. We incubate in a thermal cycler with a heated lid.
Gel electrophoresis
Prepare Agarose Gel
Measure 0.6 g Agarose powder and add it to a 200 ml conical flask.
Add 60 ml TAE Buffer to the flask to make 1% agarose gel.
Cover the opening with aluminium foil.
Melt the agarose using the hot plate until the solution becomes clear .
Let the solution cool to about 50-55°C using water bath, swirl the flask occasionally to cool evenly.
Add 6 ul of SYBR Green dye into the solution. (SYBR Green is light-sensitive, keep it dark).
Seal the ends of the casting tray with two layers of tap
Place the combs in the gel casting tray.
Pour the melted agarose solution into the casting tray and let cool until it is solid (it should appear milky white).
Carefully pull out the combs and remove the tape.
Place the gel in the electrophoresis chamber.
Add enough TAE Buffer (About 120 ml) so that there is about 2-3 mm of buffer over the gel.
Loading The Gel
Record the order each sample will be loaded on the gel, including who prepared the sample, the DNA template - from what organism did the DNA came from, controls and ladder.
Add 2 ul loading buffer on parafilm. (Same number as sample)
Carefully pipette 10 ul of each sample and mix with loading buffer.
Load the mixed sample to the corresponding well.
Pipette 10 ul of the DNA ladder marker into at least one well of each row on the gel.
Running The Gel
Place the lid on the gel box, connecting the electrodes.
Connect the electrode wires to the power supply, making sure the positive (red) and negative (black) are correctly connected.  (Remember – “Run to Red”)
Turn on the power supply to about 120 volts.
Check to make sure the current is running through the buffer by looking for bubbles forming on each electrode.
Check to make sure that the current is running in the correct direction by observing the movement of the blue loading dye – this will take a couple of minutes  (it will run in the same direction as the DNA).
Let the power run until the blue dye approaches the end of the gel.
Turn off the power.
Disconnect the wires from the power supply.
Remove the lid of the electrophoresis chamber.
Using gloves, carefully remove the tray and gel.
DNA purification from gel by using Invitrogen™ PureLink™ Quick Gel Extraction Kit
Excising and Dissolving the Gel
Equilibrate a water bath or heat block to 50°C.
Excise a minimal area of gel containing the DNA fragment of interest.
Weigh the gel slice containing the DNA fragment using a scale sensitive to 0.001 g.
Add Gel Solubilization Buffer (L3) to the excised gel in the tube size indicated in the following table:
Gel
Tube
Buffer L3 Volume
≤2% agarose
1.7-mL polypropylene

>2% agarose
5-mL polypropylene
6:1 (i.e., 2.4 mL Buffer L3: 400 mg gel piece)
Place the tube with the gel slice and Buffer L3 into a 50°C water bath or heat block. Incubate the tube at 50°C for 10 minutes . Invert the tube every 3 minutes  to mix and ensure gel dissolution.
Note: High concentration gels (>2% agarose) or large gel slices may take longer than 10 minutes  to dissolve.
After the gel slice appears dissolved, incubate the tube for an additional 5 minutes .
For optimal DNA yields, add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the dissolved gel slice. Mix well.
Purify the DNA using a Centrifuge.
Purifying DNA Using a Centrifuge
Add ethanol to the Wash Buffer (W1) according to the label on the bottle provided by the testkit set.  Pipet the dissolved gel piece onto a Quick Gel Extraction Column inside a Wash Tube. Use 1 column per 400 mg of agarose gel.
Note: The column reservoir capacity is 850 µL. Centrifuge the column at >12,000 × g for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and place the column into the Wash Tube.
Add 500 µL Wash Buffer (W1) containing ethanol to the column.
Centrifuge the column at >12,000 × g for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and place the column into the Wash Tube.
Centrifuge the column at maximum speed for 1–2 minutes . Discard the flow-through.
Place the column into a Recovery Tube. Add 50 µL Elution Buffer (E5) to the center of the column. Incubate the tube for 1 minute at room temperature.
Centrifuge the tube at >12,000 × g for 1 minute.
Store the purified DNA in elution tube at 4°C for immediate use or at −20°C for long-term storage.
Ligation
Add 2 ul of digested plasmid backbone (25 ng).
>Add 2 ul of EcoRI-HF PstI digested fragment.

Note: Do not use quick ligase.
Add 0.5 ul T4 DNA ligase.
Add water to 10 ul.
Ligate 16C/30 min, heat kill 80C/20 min.
Transform with 1-2 ul of product.
Single tube transformation
Resuspend DNA with 10µl dH20. Pipet up and down several times, let sit for a few minutes . Resuspension will be red from cresol red dye.
Label 1.5ml tubes with part name or well location. Fill lab ice bucket with ice, and pre-chill 1.5ml tubes (one tube for each transformation, including your control) in a floating foam tube rack.
Thaw competent cells on ice, this may take 10-15 minutes for a 260µl stock. Dispose of unused competent cells. Do not refreeze unused thawed cells, as it will drastically reduce transformation efficiency.
Pipette 50µl of competent cells into 1.5 ml tube, 50µl in a 1.5ml tube per transformation. Tubes should be labeled, pre-chilled, and in a floating tube rack for support. Keep all tubes on ice. Don’t forget a 1.5ml tube for your control.
Pipette 1µl of resuspended DNA into 1.5 ml tube, pipette from well into appropriately labeled tube. Gently pipette up and down a few times. Keep all tubes on ice.
Pipette 1µl of control DNA into 2 ml tube, pipette 1µl of 10pg/µl control into your control transformation. Gently pipette up and down a few times. Keep all tubes on ice.
Close 1.5ml tubes, incubate on ice for 30 minutes, tubes may be gently agitated/flicked to mix solution, but return to ice immediately.
Heat shock tubes at 42°C for 45 sec, 1.5ml tubes should be in a floating foam tube rack. Place in water bath to ensure the bottoms of the tubes are submerged. Timing is critical.
Incubate on ice for 5 minutes, Return transformation tubes to ice bucket.
Pipette 950µl SOC media to each transformation, SOC should be stored at 4°C, but can be warmed to room temperature before use. Check for contamination.
Incubate at 37°C for 1 hours, shaking at 200-300rpm
Pipette 100 µL of each transformation onto petri plates Spread with sterilized spreader or glass beads immediately. This helps ensure that you will be able to pick out a single colony.
Spin down cells at 6800g for 3 minutes and discard 800 µL of the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in the remaining 100 µL, and pipette each transformation onto petri plates, spread with sterilized spreader or glass beads immediately. This increases the chance of getting colonies from lower concentration DNA samples.
Incubate transformations overnight (14-18 hours) at 37°C,  incubate the plates upside down (agar side up). If incubated for too long, colonies may overgrow and the antibiotics may start to break down; un-transformed cells will begin to grow.
Pick single colonies: Pick single colonies from transformations: do a colony PCR to verify part size, make glycerol stocks, grow up cell cultures and miniprep.
