Weekly Course
Summer camp in HKUST
Sharing to students
Knowing that about 1% of the world's population is suffering from gout, which is formed due to the crystallisation thus accumulation of uric acid in synovial fluid, thereby bring about extreme pain to the patients every day, we would like to use genetic engineering techniques to help them by developing a rapid detection method potential gout patients simply by measuring the concentration of uric acid in their blood. It is hoped by preventing the increase of uric acid concentration to a certain threshold, a cure for gout can thus be invented. However, our investigation towards this application is still in progress. Notwithstanding, several parts have already been designed to achieve the above goals along with assays designed to test and demonstrate the sensibility and curability of our parts.
Weekly Course
The weekly course is held every single tuesday at 16:30-18:00 for both biology research team members and anyone who is interested in UCCKE. The course covers a compressive content of synthetic biology and science through both theory mentoring and wet laboratory work. The content taught in this series of course are as follow.
Principle of Science
Principle of Synthetic Biology
Techniques of Synthetic Biology (With wet-lab experience)
3A Assembly
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
Gel Electrophoresis
Laboratory safety
Laboratory skills and Preparation
The course has received very positive feedback from our student too. The course have grown from a total participant of 12 to around 45 participants (including staff members) and is currently one of the most famous Co-Curricular Activities in our school, attracting a lot of newcomers every year. We are working on building a much larger team and creating a stronger bond between the teammates.
For every topic mentioned before, we created a set of teaching materials including fact sheet, worksheet, protocol and quizes. We do this to ensure that they will understand and remember those techniques easily. The following image is a part of our fact sheet for transformation. A link to download all materials in zip format is provided below the image.
Summer camp in HKUST
This camp is held on the 3rd of August to the 5th of August in HKUST. Camp content includes experiments about transformation and polymerase chain reaction. Also teachings about basic knowledge of central dogma.On the last day,we hosted a talk by our team and professors from universities.  All students gained a lot and have a taste of working in lab.
Sharing to students
We often hold public sharing on science, particularly synthetic biology, to the fellow students and teachers in our school. What we have done over the years is fruitful and have definitely match our aim to cultivate a research and science atmosphere in UCCKE. Here is a list of activities with details of what we have done in the past year.
