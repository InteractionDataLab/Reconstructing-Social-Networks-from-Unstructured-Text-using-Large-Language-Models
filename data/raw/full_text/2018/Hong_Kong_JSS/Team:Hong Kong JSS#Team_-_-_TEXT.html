About Us
We are the Hong Kong Joint-Secondary School iGEM team (HKJSS), a joint high school team from Hong Kong. Our team consists of 43 dedicated students coming from United Christian College (Kowloon East), Pentecostal School, Yan Oi Tong Tin Ka Ping Secondary School and Po Leung Kuk Celine Ho Yam Tong College. Supported by our schools and the Tin Ka Ping Foundation, 23 of us will be attending the jamboree in Boston.
About Our Schools
United Christian College (Kowloon East)
United Christian College (Kowloon East) was founded in 2003. We are an EMI and co-ed school with an enrolment of about 900 students. The teachers are dedicated and qualified.
The school provides a different sky of learning with a broad and challenging curriculum. Our priority is to offer an all-rounded and quality education, emphasising on academic excellence, broadening international perspective, fostering positive and lasting godly values in the lives of our students. United Christian Community Church, which is a part of the School, further provides pastoral support to the school community. Together with committed teachers who are dedicated to Christian school education, the school finds pride in making it a unique quality Christian secondary school in Hong Kong.
Pentecostal School
Established in 1973 by Kowloon Pentecostal Church Ltd., it is a CMI school with about 900 students.  Pentecostal school emphasizes to enhance career planning and multiple pathways and nurture students' self-directed abilities. The school implemented 'Career and Life Planning', different life planning activities both outside and inside classes are organized to enable students to gain a better understanding of the students themselves. To prepare the students for university studies, the students are equipped with interview skills and provided with different seminars to establish their goals in studies.
Yan Oi Tong Tin Ka Ping Secondary School
Dr. Tin Ka Ping founded the school in 1987.  The ratio of teachers with postgraduate qualifications is one of the highest among all secondary schools in Hong Kong. Currently, around 50% of our teaching staff is holders of Master / Doctoral Degrees.
The School Motto is lucidly set out, and manifests consistently in the School's policies and ethos.
"One Sport One Art for One Student" Program encourages students to broaden their horizons by pursuing their interests in non-academic areas.
The School environment is caring and supportive, fostering a close relationship among teachers and students.
It pays a lot of attention to the discipline and behaviour of students and has been actively collaborating with partners in the community. Activities have been organized in collaboration with community organizations, while some students have initiated academic activities in the community to promote academic development within the district.
Po Leung Kuk Celine Ho Yam Tong College
Established in 2001, it was the thirteenth secondary school to open in Po Leung Kuk. We adhere to the mission and vision of Po Leung Kuk, and attach great importance to students’ balanced learning including moral, intellectual, physical, communal and aesthetic education, and nurture students to develop nobleness and a correct outlook of life.
The mission is to enhance students’ interest in learning and unearth their potential by means of inspiration. Our school’s motto is love, respect, diligence and integrity; it is hoped that students can learn to respect and strive for excellence. Moreover, the College will keep close contact with parents to ensure their child grows happily.
The College nurtures students to become trilingual and biliterate individuals equipped with high order thinking ability and presentation skills.
