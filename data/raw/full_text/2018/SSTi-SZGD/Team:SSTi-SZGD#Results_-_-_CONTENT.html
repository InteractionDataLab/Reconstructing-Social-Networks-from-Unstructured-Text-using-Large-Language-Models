									Our project is to use food-grade <I>B. subtilis 168</I> as a host, which is prokaryotic expression system with unique advantages (i.e. high-density growth, endotoxin free supernatant, secretory expression for easy protein purification, etc.). By cloning <I>hasA</I> gene, derived from S. Zooepidemicus, into <I>B. subtilis 168</I>, containing two precursor synthesis pathways (different from zooviral streptococcus), HA synthase can be expressed heterogeneously to regulate the biosynthesis of HA polymers that express extracellularly. <I>hasA</I> coding sequence was commercially synthesized and subcloned into the integration vector pAX01 at the restriction sites SacII and BamHI (Figure.1). The integration of <I>hasA</I> gene into <I>B.subtilis</I> genome to generate a <I>168E</I> strain was confirmed by colony PCR polymerization.

									A fed-batch fermentation strategy was employed to ensure an optimal HA production over a time course. We performed a 48 h high-cell-density fermentation experiment using MM medium with xylose as an inducer. Sucrose was fed to the batch at designated time points. HA concentrations and cell growth densities were measured every 12 h.

									</P></DIV><P>
									The results showed that HA production increased at a steady rate as time passed, reaching over 300mg/L (CTAB method) at the 50 h; while bacterial cells maintained normal growth pattern and experienced lag phase dropping in the final hours. These results confirmed the success of HA production by recombinant <I>B.subtilis</I> 168E strain.
								</P></DIV><DIV class="Three"><P class="subtitle">Optimizing HA production Level by Regulating Precursor Genes</P><P>
								We would like to take HA production to the next level by co-overexpressing some key native genes that play a role in biosynthesis of the two HA precursors, UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc. There are a handful genes available (Figure 5) however due to time limits, we selected three of them, tuaD, gtaB, and glmU to analyze (Figure 6). tuaD and gtaB gene products regulate the last two steps in the synthetic pathway of UDP-GlcUA, while gene product of glmU regulates the final two steps in the synthetic pathway of UDP-G lcNAc. By conducting CTAB experiments that form turbidity from a reaction between HA and CTAB solution, the results showed a remarkable increase in HA production when co-overexpressed tuaD-gtaB together (488mg/L, a 38% increase) (Figure7b), suggesting that UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (encoded by tuaD) and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (encoded by gtaB), are two key enzymes in the biosynthesis of UDP-GlcUA and HA in B. subtilis. Similar results have been reported in recombinant L. lactis (1). On the other hand, the overexpression of glmU, which encodes the bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes glucosamine-1-phosphate to UDP-N-acetyl gluco-samine, also gave rise to a greater amount of HA (448mg/L, a 32% increase) (Figure 7b), which is consistent with previous reports (2). Together these results suggested that optimization of precursor genes has positive effects on HA production. Co-overexpression of tuaD and gtaB genes seemed to have a slightly better effect on HA production compared to that of glmU alone.

									In addition, Ubblelohde viscometer method indicated that HA products secreted from these recombinant expression systems were with comparable molecular weights, suggesting that they are all high-molecular-weight HA products (~4.233*106Da) (Figure 8).

									Conclusion: we successfully constructed a recombinant <I>B. subtilis</I> 168E strain secreting high molecular weight HA. By overexpressing three of the precursor genes in <I>B. subtilis</I>, HA production level increased by 38%, indicating augmentation in the biosynthesis of the two precursors, <I>UDP-GlcUA</I> and <I>UDP-GlcNAc</I>, is vital to achieve high level of HA production. In the future we will investigate the effects of co-overexpression of other precursor genes on HA production in <I>B. subtilis</I>168E.

									In order to construct a recombinant <I>B. subtilis 168</I> strain that is able to secrete low-molecular-weight HA, a leech HA hydrolyzing gene (LHAyal) is cloned into the wildtype <I>B. subtilis 168</I> to express hyaluronidase (HAase). An a-amylose signal peptide (AmyX) was added to the N-terminus of the LHAyal coding sequence to construct an extracellular secretory system. Furthermore, 6xHis tag has been extensively used in recombinant protein expression to facilitate protein purification process. Compare with other lengths of his tags, 6xHis tag provides sufficient space that ensures the proper folding of mature protein. We added a 6xHis tag between AmyX and LHAyal coding sequence. Two plasmid vectors, pDG1730 and pMA0911, were used to compare protein expression efficiency. Colony PCR polymerization confirmed the construction of the recombinant B. subtilis strains.

									Similar to HA production, a fed-batch fermentation strategy was also employed to ensure maximal expression of LHAase over a time course. We performed a 60 h high-cell-density fermentation experiment with feeding of fresh culture media every 12 h. LHAase production and cell growth density were measured at regular interval. As expected, fusion of the signal peptide and 6xHis tag resulted to a distinct accumulation of extracellular LHAase in the flask culture. (Figure 11) showed that LHAase expression increased exponentially as time passed, enzymatic activity up to 1.149*105 U/ml at the final 60 h (in pDG1730 vector); on the other hand, overexpression of LHAyal did not seem to affect normal bacterial growth (Figure 11). Therefore N-terminal engineering enables an extracellular secretion of hyaluronidase. A visual HA plate assay was also conducted to verify and confirm the activity of LHAase. HA hydrolysis by the crude culture supernatant resulted to the appearance of a circle zone around the hole, indicating that leech LHAase has distinct hyaluronidase function and can be successfully overexpressed in B. Subtilis (Figure 12).

									In addition, we extracted total RNA at each indicated time point to understand the expression pattern at transcriptional level. By reverse transcribing mRNA to cDNA and performed RT-PCR using LHAyal primers, the results showed that mRNA levels accumulated up to 48 h and seemed to drop at 60 h (Figure 13). Given Figure 11 showing that LHAase production continued to rise up to 60 h, it is possible to assume that LHAase production may cease to increase after 60 h, due to a drop in mRNA transcripts after 48 h of bacterial growth. In the future we will explore this further.

									We further analyzed LHAase enzyme activity using ELISA assay. By interacting with a HAase antibody, the ELISA results confirmed that LHAase has hyaluronidase property (Figure 16). It is interesting to note that LHAyal subcloned in pMA0911 vector seemed to have a better LHAase activity than that of in pDG1730 vector, which is an integration vector. This may suggest that integration of LHAyal expression cassette into the genome of B. subtilis 168 somehow inhibits LHAyal overexpression.

									By transforming pDG1730-LHAyal vector into recombinant B. subtilis 168E, we devoted to achieve a cell factory that is able to directly produce low molecular weight HA. Although recombinant LHAyal in pMA0911 vector seemed to have more prominent enzymatic activity, we still decided to use pDG1730-LHAyal vector to construct a recombinant strain based on two reasons: 1) recombinant LHAyal in pDG1730 had a comparable enzymatic activity compare to that in pMA0911, 2) pDG1730 is an integration vector that help inserting LHAyal gene into the genome of B.subtilis to avoid plasmid loss. It also provides convenience for further introduction of other plasmid into the recombinant strain.

									HA secreted in culture supernatant was separated and purified, gel chromatography (GPC-RI-MALS) was performed to evaluate the molecular weight of HA molecules(4). The results showed that the average molecular weight of HA decreased significantly from HA produced in 168E strain to that of 168E+LHAyal strain (Mw from ~6 x 106 to ~5x 104) (Figure 17), suggesting that LHAase expressed extracellularly was able to hydrolyze HA polymers in culture environment. We also analyzed HA concentration by CTAB methods. Surprisingly, the resulted showed a significant increase in HA production in 168E+LHAyal strain (780mg/L), compared to that of 168E strain (303mg/L) (Figure 18). This 260% increase indicated a new approach to overcome the bottleneck in HA production via microbial fermentation. It is likely that reduced molecular weight results to a reduction in cultural viscosity, which in turn increases dissolved oxygen level that provides an improved condition for bacterial growth.

									At present, BTH dominates commercial HAase market as the expression level of other recombinant HAases are too low to meet practical needs. By employing N-terminal engineering and fed-batch fermentation, considerable amount of LHAase was obtained, with a crude titre of 1.149*105 U/ml, a value that is higher than that of commercial BTH (1.05*103 U/mg, 20-25% pure (5) obtained from bovine testicle extraction. The hydrolysis property of LHAase was evaluated and confirmed in a HA-secreting recombinant B.subtilis 168E strain, where low molecular weight HA (around 5 x 104 Da) was produced at a relatively higher concentration compared to that of the HMW-HA.

									In order to successfully fabricate a HA microneedle, we tested different weight ratio of the HA molecules and cHA. The experimental results showed that the ratio of HA-cHA (0:1) forms a lump after overnight curing and is easily broken into powder. The ratio of HA-cHA (1:1) is difficult to be demolded after overnight curing, and could not form a complete needle shape, while being poor in mechanical properties and spreadability. The ratio of HA-cHA (5:1) forms complete microneedles after overnight curing, and the patch is easily to be demolded, with high mechanical strength and spreadability (Figure 20). Therefore, the ratio of HA-cHA (5:1) is the most suitable ratio for preparing microneedles that have appear to be strong and sharp enough to penetrate into the skin. It took less than 48 h to complete a microneedle patch and the required materials are minimal. Microneedle made from micromold-based fabrication technology is suitable for mass production due to high production efficiency, and repeat-using of the mold.

									Microneedle experiments demonstrated that we successfully fabricated HA microneedles using a mixture of cHA and HA molecules. This particle microneedle product has high mechanical strength and spreadability, and a stabilized needle structure did not impair its water soluble property, as it can rapidly dissolve in aqueous solutions. We came a long way searching for the most suitalbe ratio for fabricating HA microneedles(6). At this stage, ratio of 5:1 (HA-cHA) seems to give the best outcome. However, after curing overnight, the surface of microneedle patch gets dry so quickly, possibly due to a quick evaporation, that sometimes causing the surface to crack. Our next step is to test other ratios (1:3:, 3:1, 1:4, 4:1, etc) in order to search for more appropriate weight ration for microneedle fabrication.
								</P><P>
									Due to time limits, we are unable to conduct all experiments that validate the function of HA microneedles. In the future we plan to conduct the following experiments, 1) test the in vitro degradation rate of microneedles by using hyluronidase, 2) use skin models (i.e. pig skin) to test the mechanical strength and penetration efficiency of the microneedles, and 3) test the penetration/insertion ability and in vivo
