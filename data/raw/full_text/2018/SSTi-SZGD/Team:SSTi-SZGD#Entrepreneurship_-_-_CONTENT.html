							In order to bridge the gap between laboratory research and commercialization, we implemented our project “hyaluronic acid production plus microneedle patch formulation” into commercial advantage. Imagine that we are a startup company that provides solutions right from various mass hyaluronic acid production to comprehensive microneedle preparation. Based on the analysis of the current market, relevant products, and feasible promotional channels, we came up with a comprehensive business plan with respects to business model, marketing strategy, market and financial analysis.

							We constructed a business model canvas (below) as a guideline for our overall project direction. It plays the role of summarizing business model, and providing guidance for long-term implementation. From time to time, we would make changes on the canvas, through looking for loopholes on the existing business model to avoid potentially incorrect business decisions. Overall, this canvas will help us stay on top of the project.

							According to the data of “2018 market analysis report of sodium hyaluronate in China -- industry operation situation and development trend forecast”, hyaluronic acid containing cosmetics and skin care products raised to a sale of $2,543 million in 2017.

							According to figure 1, at present, hyaluronic acid is on the rise in the beauty industry, showing a strong marketing potential. In recent years, with the rapid development of biotechnology, biological and microbial preparations of active ingredients and effective materials used in cosmetics have been widely applied in many aspects of industrial production. Many biological materials, such as hyaluronic acid (HA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and epidermal growth factor (EGF), have been successfully applied in cosmetics as effective additives. One of the main directions of cosmetic development is towards biologization. With the improvement of fermentation technology and production expansion, hyaluronic acid (HA) has become an important component in skin care products, and highly recognized by the market and consumers.
						</P><P>					Currently, most of the HA products on the market only stay on skin epidermis temporarily, and cannot penetrate into the skin dermis. As a result, the water retention effect of HA is not obvious, and the duration is short, which requires frequent use to maintain the effect. According to the market prospect and demand, we proposed to develop a crosslinked HA based microneedle product. Through the percutaneous penetration system of microneedle, HA can be released efficiently through the epidermis, giving full play to the role of HA, with better effect. According to the current demand of consumers for HA and the market analysis of the cosmetic’s industry, hyaluronic acid microneedle has a strong market potential to replace the traditional injection methods.

							Cosmetics as a kind of daily consumables have been accepted by more and more consumers. According to TNS Worldpanel Europe, women aged 40-59 in Europe spend nearly twice as much on facial care as women aged 25-39, while women over 60 account for almost 34% of the facial care market. These data reflect that the consumption of cosmetics by women in developed countries increases with age. On the one hand, with the disposable income increases, the demand for anti-aging products also increases.

According to the report, the consumption proportion and growth rate of people aged between 26 and 35 in facial skin care and perfume and color cosmetics in 2016 were significantly higher than that of other age groups. Among skin care products, anti-wrinkle products accounted for the highest average consumption amount in 2017, followed by moisturizing and moisturizing products. At present, the post-80s generation is the main anti-wrinkle consumption target group. With the enhancement of young people's awareness of skin care and the early start of skin care, the number of anti-wrinkle products among the post-90s generation is also increasing, accounting for nearly 15%. According to a report on the survey of cosmetics consumers in China in 2017, the proportion of cosmetics consumption of 25-35 years old is 76%, and that of those over 35 years old is 12%.
