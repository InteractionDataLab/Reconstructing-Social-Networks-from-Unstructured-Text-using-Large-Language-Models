Overview
This year, we submitted seven new parts in total, including four basic parts and three composite parts. We took advantage on the BGI China special gene synthesis promotion offer in August this year to synthesize our basic parts, such as coding sequence, RBS, promoter and signal peptide separately. The composite parts were generated using a combination of PCR, restriction ligation and 3A assembly methods. All submitted parts are RFC10 compatible.

Improved parts
In our project, we added to the characterization of  an existing Biobrick , design by Philip Hartz from iGEM Saarland 2014. Our P43-tuaD-gtaB-T1 composite part was designed based on two BioBrick parts ( BBa_K1469002 and BBa_K1469005 ) created by Saarland. For example, co-expression of tuaD-gtaB as an operon under the control a constitutive promoter so that recombinant B. Subtilis 168 produces elevated level of HA.
