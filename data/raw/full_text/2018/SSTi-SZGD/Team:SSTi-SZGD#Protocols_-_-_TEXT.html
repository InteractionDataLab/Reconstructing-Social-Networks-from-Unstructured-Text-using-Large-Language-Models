Clean the viscometer using suitable solvents, and by passing clean, dry, filtered air through the instrument to remove the final traces of solvents.
Place the viscometer into the holder, and insert it into the constant temperature bath. Vertically align the viscometer in the bath if a self-aligning holder has not been use.
Place a finger over tube M and apply suction to tube N until the liquid reaches the center of bulb D. Remove suction from tube N. Remove finger from tube M, and immediately place it over tube N until the sample drops away from the lower end of the capillary into bulb B. Then remove finger and measure the efflux time.
To measure the efflux time, allow the liquid sample to flow freely down past mark E, measuring the time for the meniscus to pass from mark E to mark F.

HA Microneedle Experiment
Reagent preparation:
BDDE(1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether，MW = 202.25Da);
0.25 mol/L NaOH  (pH 13) ; HA (MW = 447.37Da);

Fabrication of cHA hydrogel particles:
Cross-linking HA (cHA) reagent solution was prepared by mixing 200μL of 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) into 9.8 mL of 0.25 mol/L NaOH, (pH 13).
Approximately 1.0g of HA powder was added to the cHA reagent solution and stirred well, and thoroughly mixed at 40℃ for 5 hours.
The prepared hydrogel was ground, squeezed out and screened with a 170 mesh sieve to get particles having a diameter of less than 90 μm.
Fabrication of HA-cHA-micro-needles(MN):
(1)We prepare HA-cHA-MNs by mixing different proportions of HA-cHA mixture, so we will use three ratios to compare. (1:0,1:1,5:1)
(2)The mixtures were dissolved in ultrapure water and a 20% (w/v) viscous polymer solution was stirred at room temperature under a magnetic stirrer for the production of homogenous suspension.
(3)The polymer solution was poured into a mold, placed in a centrifuge and centrifuged at 10,000rpm for 10min, and then taken out (this step was repeated twice), and then the polymer solution was again poured into the mold.
(4)After curing overnight at room temperature, the cured MN was successfully prepared by separating from the mold using a blade.
