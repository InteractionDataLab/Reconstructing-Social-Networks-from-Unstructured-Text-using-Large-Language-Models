In our modern world, millions of people do not hesitate to spend a fortune to achieve younger looking and vibrant appearances, thus the cosmetic industry keeps growing.
Hyaluronic acid is one of the mostly used ingredients in cosmetic products, thanks to its exceptional water retention ability that helps rejuvenating skin and reducing wrinkles.
Hyaulornic acid production via microbial fermentation is generally through Streptococus species, which contains endotoxins. We constructed recombinant Bacillus subtilis , the food-grade safe species, to mass produce hyaluronic acid.
After covalently cross-link, low molecular weight hyaluronic acid (LMW-HA) forms stable hydrogel that is important for film-forming process. By introducing a hydrolase gene, we constructed a B. Subtilis strain that is able to biosynthesize LMW-HA.
We developed a novel cosmetic product: HA Micro-Needle Patch !!!
