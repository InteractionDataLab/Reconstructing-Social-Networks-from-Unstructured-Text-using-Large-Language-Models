In the past ten months, we experience the biggest challenge in our lives, from the initial interest in synthetic biology to the team formation, project brainstorming and learning of theoretical and experimental operations, and eventually we managed to successfully completed the entire project. In the whole process, we received tremendous supports from many people, including instructors, advisors, sponsors, families, and related organizations. 
Without their supports, our project would not possibly exist. Their supports and helps were not only materially but also mentally, encouraging us to overcome obstacles one by one. We would like to express our highest respect and sincere gratitude to those for making our project possible.
