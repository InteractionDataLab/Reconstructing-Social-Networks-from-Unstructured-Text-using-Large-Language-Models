Nation-wide Issue
Indiscriminate spitting of red coloured      catechu after ‘paan’ consumption makes      public places and historical monuments      unsightly & unhygienic.
Prevalent not only in India but also in      much of the South Asian continent!

Our Solution
Our synthetic biology solution will contribute in saving CRORES of government money, LAKHS of litres     of water and THOUSANDS of manual labour hours which      the country is spending since many years to scrub these paan      stains off.
Catechewing coli
Catechewing coli is a stain-degrading genetically engineered      machine which is designed in such a way that not only will it degrade the stubborn paan stains but also would prevent its      diffusion in the environment by having a kill switch module built      in.       To know more click here..
Stakeholders & communities
The enormity of this problem made us involve various stakeholders & communities in the society so that our system is optimised      towards their needs and can be further turned into a more      commercial aspect.To know more click here...
