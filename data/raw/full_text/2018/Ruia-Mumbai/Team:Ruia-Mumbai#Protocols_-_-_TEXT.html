PROTOCOLS
Protocol 1:
Aim: Determining the solubility of finely powdered catechu in 100ml of boiling distilled water and ethanol.
Protocol:
(For distilled water)
150 ml of distilled water was heated to its boiling point and then 100ml of this was taken into a separate beaker.
A pinch of finely powdered catechu from 0.1g was added to check the solubility.
A colloidal solution was obtained.
0.1g of catechu was added to boiling distilled water and heated for 5 minutes.
(for Ethanol)
Add 0.1g catechu in 10 ml of ethanol (i.e 1% of catechu) .
Check whether it is soluble or not.
Protocol 2 :
Aim: To standardize the quantitative assay of colour produced due to mixing of catechu and slaked lime.
Goal: To have a standard graph of absorbance vs concentration of our coloured compound.
The graph obtained shall serve as a standard while doing the enzyme assays to check the efficiency of pigment degradation.

Protocol 3:
Aim:To measure the optical density of the colour produced due to mixing of catechu and slaked lime colorimetrically.
Protocol:
(KEEPING CATECHU CONSTANT)
Weigh fixed amount of sieved catechu powder and slaked lime (in grams) (amount needs to be standardised)
Mix the two components in various ratios.(1:2,1:3,1:4,1:5)
(since catechu is constant the amount of slaked lime must be varied)
Add a fixed volume of boiling water to the mixtures with 1:2,1:3,1:4 and 1:5.

For Catechu+slaked lime:
Take six 100 ml beakers and add 100 ml of boiling distilled water to it.
To each of the beakers add 0.1g gram of catechu and let it boil again for 10 minutes to extract the catechu pigment.
Cool these solutions and then add slake lime paste to it in the following manner:

Protocol 5:
Aim:
To determine the effect of varying concentration of catechu extracted and constant amount of slake lime added.( from the experimentation done with protocol 3 it was determined that maximum intensity of red colour solution was obtained in solution of 1:0.1 catechu:slake lime conc.)
Protocol:
Boil around 500 ml of distilled water and using a measuring flask transfer 100 ml to 5 different beakers.
Add 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 grams of fine catechu powder to different beakers.
Hence ratios would now be, 10:1, 20:1, 30:1, 40:1, 50:1 catechu:slake lime conc.
Heat these mixtures again separately till boiling and let cool at RT then ice water bath.
Add 0.01 g slake lime in each beaker and then stir till the white powder is completely dissolved.
Centrifuge the mixtures and collect the supernatant.
Discard the pellet (which may be white ppt or slightly reddish brown)
Protocol 6:
Aim: To determine the relative amounts of Catechu and slake lime required in media preparation.
Goal: To have a standard protocol for extraction of catechu pigment for the purpose of media preparation.
Protocol :
Take six 100 ml beakers and add 100 ml of boiling distilled water to it.
To each of the beakers add 0.1g gram of catechu and let it boil again for 10 minutes to extract the catechu pigment.

Protocol 7 :
Aim: Preparation of stock solution of catechu extract to be added in media.
Protocol :
Boil around 150 ml of distilled water and take 100 ml of this in a beaker using a standard measuring flask.
Add 10g of catechu to this boiling water.
Mix it well and boil the water again for 5 minutes.
Cool the catechu solution in an ice bath.
After it is cooled, add 1g of slaked lime and mix it well till all the slaked lime reacts with the catechu.
Centrifuge this solution at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes and collect the supernatant and again centrifuge it at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes to get rid of suspended particles.
The supernatant is your stock solution of catechu extract.
Add 10 ml of this solution to 100ml of media.
Sterilization of catechu stock:
Using a membrane filter having pore size of 0.22 micron filter the catechu extract through a sterile membrane filtration assembly in a LAF.
