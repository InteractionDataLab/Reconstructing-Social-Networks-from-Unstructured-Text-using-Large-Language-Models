COMPOSITE PARTS
 
Two Composite parts were cloned which are submitted to iGEM with DNA Submission kit and added to the registry.
pBAD_xylE : BBa_K2749005
pBAD_ompT_xylE : BBa_K2749003
pBAD_xylE:
The part consists of promoter pBAD which in presence of arabinose initiates transcription and hence synthesis of the enzyme catechol-2,3-dioxygenase, which degrade catechol to 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde.

Our use of the part in the project: Tannins are major constituents of catechu. Catechu/katha being the substance causing red colour in the the paan is targeted to degrade, hence degrading the red colour.
Since tannins are constituted of monomer catechins, epicatechin, gallic and ellagic acid which  have similar structures as that of catechol, catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (enzyme which cleaves the double bond between 2nd and 3rd carbon double bond in the phenolic ring) is used to determine catechu degradation.

pBAD_ompT_xylE:BBa_K2749003
This part consists of an arabinose induced promoter pBAD which in presence of arabinose allows transcription of ompT-an aspartic type endopeptidase allowing extracellular production of enzyme catechol 2,3-dioxygenase causing cleavage of oxidative ring of catechol.
