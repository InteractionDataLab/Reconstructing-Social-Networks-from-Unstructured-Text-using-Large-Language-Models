				  Safety in the lab
				</H2><DIV class="p">
				  Security is a prerequisite for any academic research to be ensured. As our team's products are mainly
				  industry-oriented, safety issues are of the top priority.
				  Professor.Ding is responsible for the safety and security of our lab and his students will promise the safety of
				  daily experiments.
				  Biosafety officers will guide us how to do a good job in lab safety protection, obey experimental procedures
				  carefully and operate equipments correctly. It is helpful for us to decrease the risks.
				  Here are rules in the lab
				  1. Must be familiar with the laboratory and the surrounding environment.
				  such as water valve, gas valve, switch, safety door location, fire extinguishers and outdoor source location.
				  2. When the experiment is carried out, we should not leave the post casually and pay close attention to the
				  progress of the experiment.
				  3. In the event of a potentially dangerous experiment, the necessary safety measures, such as wearing protective
				  glasses, masks or rubber gloves, should be taken in accordance with the experiment. 4. Do experiments should open
				  doors and windows or ventilation equipment, to maintain indoor air circulation.
				  Heating volatile harmful liquids, prone to serious odor, easy to pollute the environment in the experiment should
				  be in the fume hood.
				  5. Use flammable and explosive chemical reagents, should be away from fire, wear protective glasses, protective
				  gloves and so on. 6. Laboratory chemical reagents shall not be imported, smoking or eating in the laboratory is
				  strictly forbidden. Wash your hands carefully after the experiment is over. Corrosion and irritant drugs, such as
				  strong acids, alkalis, glacial acetic acid, and so on, when possible to wear protective glasses, protective gloves,
				  dumping, do not straight to the top of the container, when absorbing, should use the ear wash ball.
				  Disable bare hands to take the above items directly. 7. Beware of electric shocks when using electrical
				  appliances. Do not use wet hands and objects to contact electrical or electrical plugs when energized.
				  After the experiment, the electrical power should be cut off.
				  8. Laboratory staff must be in the laboratory uniform printed and numbered pages of the experimental records in
				  detail, the computer stored data can only be used as an attachment, not as a formal record, the experimental records
				  must be immediate, objective, detailed, clear, no alteration, tear pages and afterwards to fill the record;
				  The personnel entering the laboratory shall wear cotton overalls, sandals, high heels or slippers, and those with
				  long hair should have their hair pierced, and the work clothes should be replaced when leaving the laboratory. In the
				  laboratory is strictly forbidden to visitors, noisy. The key of the laboratory is strictly forbidden.
				  9.Each laboratory personnel must be skilled in the use of fire extinguishers. The person who finally leaves the
				  laboratory should check the water valve, switch, gas valve and so on, close the door, window, air, electricity, gas
				  before leaving the laboratory.
				  10.To achieve sterilization, open uv lamp for 30 to 60 minutes in sterile room space for 30 to 60 minutes.
				  11.Check the equipment, must be separately sterilized before moving in sterile room.
				  12.Pay attention during animal feeding, wear work clothes and gloves, if you are bitten, go to hospital
				  immediately.
				  13.Laboratory medicine can not be medical use and shall not be eaten.

				  The experimental materials used in our experiment were not of high risk, such as K-12 E. coli. These materials are
				  basically harmless to the human body.
				  We construct the expression plasmid and its expression of the signaling molecule and the fluorescent protein as
				  the natural normal substance, and the expression protein is harmless to the environment.
				  Our project poses very small risks. The actions we take to reduce those risks include wearing gloves and uniforms
				  all the time in the laboratory, removing the gloves after use, do not wear laboratory clothing outside the
				  laboratory, do not wear open-toed footwear in the laboratory working areas, do not eat, drink or store food and drink
				  anywhere in the laboratory, and sterilizing the waste such as the bacteria culture before discarding them.
