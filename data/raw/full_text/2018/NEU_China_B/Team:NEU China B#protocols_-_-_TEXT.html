Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 0.25 g
Glacial acetic acid 10 ml
MetOH:H2O (1:1 v/v) 90 ml
Destaining solution

OVERLAP PCR
OVERLAP PCR:
order two primers which are complements of one another.
These primers will each have a 60°C Tm with one part and a 60°C Tm with the other part.
The "end primers" will not have any complements and will likely only have restriction sites.
PCR amplify the necessary fragments separately. Use a proofreading polymerase enzyme. Use an annealing temp        of 60°C.
Clean up the product using a DNA column.
"Overlap PCR" Use cleaned up fragments as template in a PCR reaction:
About 1/2 to 3/4 volume of the Overlap PCR reaction should be equimolar amounts of purified fragments. Do not        use Phusion polymerase. Try Pfu Turbo. Do not add any primers; the templates will prime each-other. 3.Run 15 PCR        cycles without primers.Use an annealing temp of 60°C.
Add end primers to the Overlap PCR reaction: Continue cycling for another 15-20 rounds. Use an annealing temp        of 72°C
Gel extract the correct size fragment.
Gel Extraction
V. Gel Extraction:

Incubate at 50°C for 30 min.
Centrifuge the sample for 1 min.
Carefully remove the supernatant using a pipet or a drawn-out Pasteur pipet. Pass thesupernatant through a        disposable plastic column or a syringe containing either aWhatman GF/C filter or packed, siliconized glass wool        to remove any residualpolyacrylamide.
Determine the volume of the recovered supernatant.
Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of supernatant and mix. Check that the col or of the mixture is        yellow.
Place a QIAquick Spin Column in a provided 2 ml collection tube.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick Spin Column and centrifuge for30– 60 s.
Discard flow-through and place QIAquick Spin Column back into the same collection tube.
To wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.
Discard flow-through and place QIAquick Spin Column back in the same tube. Centrifuge column for an        additional        1 min at maximum speed.
Place QIAquick Spin Column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 50 µl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of t he QIAquick Spin Column        and centrifuge for 1 min.

Incubate for 12-16 hours at 37°C with vigorous shaking (300        rpm). Use a 10-20 mL culture tube or a flask with a volume of at least 4 times the volume of the culture.
Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 minute at room temperature. Decant or aspirate and discard the culture media.
Add 250 µL Solution I/RNase A. Vortex or pipet up and down to mix thoroughly. Complete resuspension of cell        pellet is vital for obtaining good yields.
Add 350 µL Solution III. Immediately invert several times until a flocculent white precipitate forms.
Centrifuge at maximum speed (≥13,000 x g) for 10 minutes. A compact white pellet will form. Promptly proceed        to the next step.
Insert a HiBind® DNA Mini Column into a 2 mL Collection Tube.
Transfer the cleared supernatant from Step 5 by CAREFULLY aspirating it into the HiBind® DNA Mini Column. Be        careful not to disturb the pellet and that no cellular debris is transferred to the HiBind® DNA Mini Column.
Centrifuge at 10000g speed for 1 minute.
Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.
Add 500 µL HB Buffer.
Centrifuge at 10000g speed for 1 min.
Discard the filtrate and reuse collection tube.

Centrifuge at 10000g for 1 minute.
Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.
Centrifuge the empty HiBind® DNA Mini Column for2 min at 13000g to dry the column matrix.
