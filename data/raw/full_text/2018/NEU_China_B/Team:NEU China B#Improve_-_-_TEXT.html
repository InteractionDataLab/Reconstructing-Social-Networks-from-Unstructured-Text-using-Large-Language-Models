BBa_k2824006:T7-lldPRD operon promoter-GFP
LLDPRD promoter can sense the presence of lactic acid, in the absence of lactic acid, only a lower background level     of expression, but in the presence of lactic acid can open gene expression. We integrated the GFP reporter gene     into downstream this promoter to respond to the presence of lactic acid. In order to improve the GFP expression, we     integrated a strong promoter, T7, into the upstream of lldPRD region.
This part is constructed based on the part lldRO1-plldR-lldRO2 (BBa_k82000) . lldRO1-plldR-lldRO2 part is a lactic     acid regulated promoter that is open to gene transcription in the presence of lactic acid. It can effectively     improve the expression of the target gene and detect whether the target gene is expressed or not. At the same time,     it can accurately determine the amount of the target gene. This allows the overall work of our system to be     reflected in digital form.

In the following figure, we compared the expression of lldPRD operon promoter-GFP and T7-lldPRD operon     promoter-GFP. The T7 promoter could enhance gene expression when the concentration of lactic acid was less than 1 m     mol/L. Considering that the lactate concentration in yogurt is generally no more than 1m mol/L, the conclusion can     given that the T7 promoter can enhance the signal intensity for our experiments (Figure 1).

The aim of this part is using llDPRD promoter to activate downstream GFP reporter gene expression under different     lactic acid concentration inductions and this operon is repressed without lactic acid induction. Briefly, LLdR     repression protein specifically binds to llDPRD promoter and impedes downstream gene expression, while lactic acid     enables to antagonize and replace LLdR protein to activate llDPRD promoter (Figure 1). In order to improve the GFP     expression, we integrated a strong promoter, T7, into the upstream of lldPRD region.
This part is constructed based on the part lldRO1-plldR-lldRO2 (BBa_k82000). lldRO1-plldR-lldRO2 part is a lactic     acid regulated promoter that is open to gene transcription in the presence of lactic acid. Comparing with the     T7-lldPRD operon promoter-GFP part, the improvement of this part is that the LLDR is added to part and placed under     the control of two promoters respectively to form a double expression regulatory system. This comparison with the     two plasmids working together is more convenient for testing the success of the system.

We can easily find that the Lldr-T7-lldPRD operon promoter-GFP part are in a higher level of expression comparing     to the lldPRD operon promoter-GFP when the lactate concentration is lower than nearly 1.5 mM. Considering that the     lactate concentration in yogurt is generally no more than 1 mM, the conclusion can give that the T7 promoter can     enhance the signal intensity for our experiments (Figure 2).
