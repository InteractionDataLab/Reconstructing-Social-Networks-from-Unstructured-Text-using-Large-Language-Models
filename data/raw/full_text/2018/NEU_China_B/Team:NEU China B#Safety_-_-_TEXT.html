Safety in the lab
Security is a prerequisite for any academic research to be ensured. As our team's products are mainly       industry-oriented, safety issues are of the top priority.
Professor.Ding is responsible for the safety and security of our lab and his students will promise the safety of       daily experiments.
Biosafety officers will guide us how to do a good job in lab safety protection, obey experimental procedures       carefully and operate equipments correctly. It is helpful for us to decrease the risks.
Here are rules in the lab
1. Must be familiar with the laboratory and the surrounding environment.
such as water valve, gas valve, switch, safety door location, fire extinguishers and outdoor source location.
2. When the experiment is carried out, we should not leave the post casually and pay close attention to the       progress of the experiment.
3. In the event of a potentially dangerous experiment, the necessary safety measures, such as wearing protective       glasses, masks or rubber gloves, should be taken in accordance with the experiment. 4. Do experiments should open       doors and windows or ventilation equipment, to maintain indoor air circulation.
Heating volatile harmful liquids, prone to serious odor, easy to pollute the environment in the experiment should       be in the fume hood.
5. Use flammable and explosive chemical reagents, should be away from fire, wear protective glasses, protective       gloves and so on. 6. Laboratory chemical reagents shall not be imported, smoking or eating in the laboratory is       strictly forbidden. Wash your hands carefully after the experiment is over. Corrosion and irritant drugs, such as       strong acids, alkalis, glacial acetic acid, and so on, when possible to wear protective glasses, protective gloves,       dumping, do not straight to the top of the container, when absorbing, should use the ear wash ball.
Disable bare hands to take the above items directly. 7. Beware of electric shocks when using electrical       appliances. Do not use wet hands and objects to contact electrical or electrical plugs when energized.
After the experiment, the electrical power should be cut off.
8. Laboratory staff must be in the laboratory uniform printed and numbered pages of the experimental records in       detail, the computer stored data can only be used as an attachment, not as a formal record, the experimental records       must be immediate, objective, detailed, clear, no alteration, tear pages and afterwards to fill the record;
The personnel entering the laboratory shall wear cotton overalls, sandals, high heels or slippers, and those with       long hair should have their hair pierced, and the work clothes should be replaced when leaving the laboratory. In the       laboratory is strictly forbidden to visitors, noisy. The key of the laboratory is strictly forbidden.
9.Each laboratory personnel must be skilled in the use of fire extinguishers. The person who finally leaves the       laboratory should check the water valve, switch, gas valve and so on, close the door, window, air, electricity, gas       before leaving the laboratory.
10.To achieve sterilization, open uv lamp for 30 to 60 minutes in sterile room space for 30 to 60 minutes.
11.Check the equipment, must be separately sterilized before moving in sterile room.
12.Pay attention during animal feeding, wear work clothes and gloves, if you are bitten, go to hospital       immediately.
13.Laboratory medicine can not be medical use and shall not be eaten.

Safety of our biological part
The experimental materials used in our experiment were not of high risk, such as K-12 E. coli. These materials are       basically harmless to the human body.
We construct the expression plasmid and its expression of the signaling molecule and the fluorescent protein as       the natural normal substance, and the expression protein is harmless to the environment.
Our project poses very small risks. The actions we take to reduce those risks include wearing gloves and uniforms       all the time in the laboratory, removing the gloves after use, do not wear laboratory clothing outside the       laboratory, do not wear open-toed footwear in the laboratory working areas, do not eat, drink or store food and drink       anywhere in the laboratory, and sterilizing the waste such as the bacteria culture before discarding them.
Safety of the members
All participants in the experiment were trained in laboratory safety-related training. The following projects are  for members to receive training programs
Lab access and rules (including appropriate clothing, eating and drinking, etc.)
Responsible individuals (such as lab or departmental specialist or institutional biosafety officer)
Differences between biosafety levels
Biosafety equipment (such as biosafety cabinets)
Good microbial technique (such as lab practices)
Disinfection and sterilization
Emergency procedures
Transport rules
Physical biosecurity
Personnel biosecurity
