LuxS
Coding
LuxS gene can produce LuxS protein and catalyze the formation of AI-2, a signaling molecule of the quorum sensing pathway.

BBa_K2824002
LsrA promoter
Regulatory
The LsrA promoter can be blocked by Lsrr protein, so they are not expressed in normal condition. Only when the signal molecule AI-2 exists can it bind to lsrr and change its conformation so that gene expression is no longer suppressed and can function normally.
