Our Library of Standard Biological Parts
On this page, we compiled an overview of all the BioBricks we have created this summer in our mission. The links below will lead you the corresponding registry entry. We submitted the basic parts constituting our gene fragments, then we designed the composite parts constituting these synthesised fragments and finally we assembled these composite parts into a main gene circuit (BBa_K2796060), that's our favorite part. If you'd like to to know more about our Vesicle attacker, have a look at our project or our results page.
