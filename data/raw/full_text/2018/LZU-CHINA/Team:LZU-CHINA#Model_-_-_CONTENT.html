However, excessive tetracycline can affect gastrointestinal tract, liver, blood system, central nervous system and kidney to different degrees. Tetracycline can also bind with phosphate in dentin and enamel, leading to teeth becoming yellow and bone dysplasia. Therefore, we need to establish a drug metabolism model to analyze and calculate the optimal drug concentration range during intravenous injection, to reduce the impact of tetracycline administration and provide certain mathematical basis for the selection of drug injection time and drug injection amount in practical application.<B>a.

We predicted miR-135b-3p, miR-769-5p and miR-942-5p, respectively, the inhibitory ability of these three microRNAs to other genes, the gene pathways that may be affected and the interactions between these gene pathways and analyzed the interaction network between the same functional proteins that are affected. We also predicted the genetic effects of all three on human cells at the same time. These bioinformatics results suggest that this is the kind of microRNA that has complex regulatory networks. Combined with our phenotypic results (cck-8 analysis, transwell test, flow cytometry analysis, scratch test), miR-135b-3p, miR-769-5p and miR-942-5p finally affected the activity, migration and DNA synthesis of gastric cancer cells through these regulatory networks. In addition, bioinformatic analysis indicates that much work remains to be done. Many regulatory mechanisms still need to be validated and interpreted experimentally. Nevertheless, as an important regulatory device in human organism, microRNA has a promising prospect in the application of cancer treatment.
