Even cancer cells collaborate so that they can invade our bodies and spread their wrath. For us, collaboration is a superpower that has produced incredible discoveries in the medical and scientific field.And it is the superpower that we can all turn to to inspire us to create something bigger than ourselves,that will help make the world a better place. Collaboration is the superpower that our team turn to, to help us fight cancer. And we are confident that with the right collaborations, we will beat this terrible disease.
iGEM is a great platform for us to improve ourselves. Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. Not only we can gain experiences from our own project, but also by learning from other teams to spark more innovative inspiration. Throughout the course of our project, we interacted with many teams and helped each other out in meaningful ways. Here is a record of ours collaborations.
XI’AN JIAOTONG - LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY (XJTLU )
During the later half of the iGEM season, our team was fortunate enough to be able to collaborate with the XJTLU  iGEM  team. Together, we gave feedback on each other’s projects face to face in Shanghai’ s meeting.They helped us have a deeper understand of Model, and offered their suggestions about  our project design. And also, we proposed ours  idea about how to characterize their biobricks. Except the verbal communication, we do have experimental collaborations. As both our projects are related to exosome, which functions as a vehicle to carry target particles, we offered our exosome-booster biobrick when they get stuck in its construction. At the same time, they helped us finished our exosome-booster’s efficiency model. More details for model ,please click here
Nanjing Agricultural University (NAU-CHINA)
11th Aug, our two teams had a meet together in Nanjing Agricultural University, we negotiated intentions of two teams’ projects and discussed experimental undertakings. We soon realized that it would be more significant to use a model to predict the loss of inducers because of drug metabolism or biotransformation in the living
28th Sept,  we have had candid and in-depth dialogues of our model.
Figure1: we were discussing projects.
Central South University (CSU-CHINA)
Both of ours projects need to construct stable cell line to verify our target particles’ function.With the same purpose, we sincerely invited them come to our university to have a seminar. We introduced the main experimental methods, experimental procedures, data measurement, and the issues need to pay attention to in cell operation to them.At the same time ,we gave tips on how to optimized their biobrick and successfully amplify target gene fragments.
Figure2: we showed CSU-CHINA around our microscopy center and have a talk about ours design
CCIC(Conference of Chinese iGEM community)
The fifth Conference of Chinese iGEM Community was held in Shanghai Tech University. CCIC is a platform for Chinese igem teams to share experience and receive suggestions from judges and all the Chinese igemers before the competition. CCiC Ambassador Haotian Guo queried and gave directions to ours consideration about cell’s target problems and how can we precisely control the functional particle’s expression in a complicated individual environment, which perfected our project and improved the project’s scientific rigor, becoming more convincing.
Figure3: we showed our project to all the Chinese iGEMers and obtained some feedback
Xuzhou Workshop
8th Aug, we meet Nankai University, Xiamen University, Dalian University of Technology, Jiangnan University, Zhejiang University of Technology igem teams in the final round of The third National College Students Life Science Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition. Five groups came together and had a seminar, sharing participation experience. In the light of the difficult position faced by each team, participates put forward some paths for solving these problems. Besides, our seminar drew in several dozen students and teachers from different universities, which promoted the spread of iGEM and synthesis biology in China.
Figure4: six teams came together and sparked inspirations.
About Us
We wish to extend our deepest appreciation to the Lanzhou University, The First Clinical Medical College and School of Life Science for the great support and help in this project
