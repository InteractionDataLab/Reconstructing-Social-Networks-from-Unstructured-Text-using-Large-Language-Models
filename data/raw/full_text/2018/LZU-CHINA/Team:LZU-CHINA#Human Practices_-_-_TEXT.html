Human practice
To ensure that project ideas can be applied not only in science but also in society,we conduct scientific research through four steps: anticipation, reflection, participation and action.
we designed a questionnaire and conducted a number of social analyses to anticipate our research direction. This helps to put our research in the most effective direction. In addition, through field interviews and mutual communication, we got feedback from citizens and villagers on the project.
In addition, we had in-depth exchanges with synthetic biologists, IGEM experts and professors of international law. Their message led us to rethink the direction of design. We also collaborate with local doctors to understand the prospects and directions of tumor biology in practical applications. To inspire more young people to pay attention to the field of synthetic biology, we taught synthetic biology in local schools.
Conversation with Synthetic biologist
We 're honored to invited Yamazaki, professor from Hokkaido University, used to be one of judges in the iGEM, came to Lanzhou University to give our team a synthetic biology course from 8th Aug to 14th Aug. During the workshop, we had a further and general understanding of synthetic biology, for instance, the basal knowledge like position, roles and structure of genetic elements becomes more clear. Besides, we learnt about how can we choose the correct promoter to make sure the initiate efficiency, which helped us enormously in our project. Later, we showed our project to Pro. Yamazaki and obtained feedback. Thanks to professor’s insight and helpful feedback provided at ours conference discussions.
Following is our schedule:
Conversation with Oncologists
Ren xiaoyang, a senior researcher from MD Anderson institute in Texas, US, visited Lanzhou university on April 8 and had an in-depth exchange with our team. He pointed out the shortcomings of our design and suggested us to verify our experimental function in several gastric cancer cell lines. In addition, he made important suggestions for experiments related to exosomes, and gave guidance on biosafety issues. Care should be taken when operating lentiviral vectors, he said, and although it is detoxified, lentivirus is still at risk of infecting humans. Make sure you don't leak out of the lab always. At the same time, he explained the concept of precision medicine to us, and believed that the future medical direction was targeted at specific people. These novel concepts and descriptions give us important guidance for our project.
Conversation with clinical medical expert
Peng Nie is the director of gastroenterology department of Wuwei cancer hospital. He has been in Wuwei city for a long time and has treated thousands of cancer patients. With his help, we have a deeper understanding of the clinical knowledge of gastric cancer.
Conversation with expert in international law
Usman is a foreign professor at Lanzhou university law school. His main research interests are international law and intellectual property law. He provided us great help in legal level work. We know that the secrete body enhancer prototype is made by R Kojima published, but we think we're a degree of renovation, team members want to know if our research can be published or apply for a patent, Usman professor told us that our study is a great improvement on the basis of R Kojima research, so we should can be published or apply for a patent for independent study.
Conversation with psychologists
Mr. Jokhoun is an associate professor of clinical psychology at Lanzhou university school of medicine. He has provided us with great help in clinical investigation and questionnaire design. He has also taught us how to properly communicate with cancer patients and provided us with great help in investigation and clinical practice.
Conversation with high school students
Our IGEM team members teach and interact with high school students in the affiliated middle school of Lanzhou university. Mainly about synthetic biology and our project. Students are very enthusiastic about synthetic biology. They learned about the concepts and applications of synthetic biology. In our project, students also give a lot of ideas. We should not be limited to the transformation of T cells, but to tap the potential of more applications. Reliable inducible promoters should be integrated and invented. The device of bacteria and the promoter of eukaryon should be considered synthetically. Some students hope to join our igem team and gain experience for next year's senior high school competition.
About Us
We wish to extend our deepest appreciation to the Lanzhou University, The First Clinical Medical College and School of Life Science for the great support and help in this project
