Medel Criterion
√1. Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the purpose, design, and/or execution of your project. Document on your team wiki how your project has changed based upon your human practices work. Done! See our Human Practices page here
√2. Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part here
√3. Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling. This could be either a new model you develop or the implementation of a model from a previous team. See our model page here
√4. Convince the judges that your engineered system works.
We have successfully constructed our engineering device and verify theirs function through AGE(agarose gel electrophoresis) , WB, flow cytometry, fluorescence imaging, NTA, CCK-8, Transwell and TEM. See our experimental results here
√ 1. One new BioBrick Part (Basic or Composite, must be RFC10 compatible) of your own design that is related to your project works as expected. Clearly document the experimental characterization on that Part's Main Page on the Registry.
We have submitted three BioBrick Parts： BBa_K2796028 ; BBa_K2796029 ; BBa_K2796052 ;
√ 2. Convince the judges you have significantly worked with one (or more) currently registered 2018 iGEM team(s) in a meaningful way.
Done! See our Collaborations page here
√ 3. Convince the judges you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your work is responsible and good for the world.
Done! See our Collaborations page here
√ 1. Register for iGEM, have a great iGEM season, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
√ 2. Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page (wiki, poster, Presentation and judging form)
√ 3. Attributions: We have created a page on our team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of our project. See our page here
√ 4. Successfully complete the InterLab Measurement Study here and Improve the characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information on that part's Main Page in the Registry here
