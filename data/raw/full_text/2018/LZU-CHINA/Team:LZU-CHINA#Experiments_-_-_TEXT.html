Incubate for 12-16 hours at 37°C with vigorous shaking (~ 300 rpm). Use a 10-20 mL culture tube or a flask with a volume of at least 4 times the volume of the culture. It is strongly recommended that an endA negative strain of E. coli be used for routine plasmid isolation. Examples of such strains include DH5a® and JM109®.
2. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 minute at room temperature.
3. Decant or aspirate and discard the culture media.

7. Add 350 µL Solution III. Immediately invert several times until a flocculent white precipitate forms.
Note: It is vital that the solution is mixed thoroughly and immediately after the addition of Solution III to avoid localized precipitation.
8. Centrifuge at maximum speed (≥13,000 x g) for 10 minutes. A compact white pellet will form. Promptly proceed to the next step.
9. Insert a HiBind® DNA Mini Column into a 2 mL Collection Tube.

19. Add 15-30 μL Elution Buffer or deionized water directly to the center of the column membrane.
