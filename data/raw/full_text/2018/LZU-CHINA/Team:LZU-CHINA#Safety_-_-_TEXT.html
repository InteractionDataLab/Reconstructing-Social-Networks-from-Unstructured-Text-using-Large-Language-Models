Before we were allowed to enter the laboratory, we were given a briefing by our PI, Professor Li. He informed us of all the potential risks and dangers associated with the use of different chemicals, techniques, and equipment, and how we could minimise these risks. Following this, we were given a laboratory induction by our instructor, who demonstrated the safest and most efficient ways to carry out the protocols we would require. Full details of these protocols can be found here.       In our experiments, aseptic techniques were always used when handling live culture. All the cell experiments are operated in the Biosafety Cabinet, including HIV derived lentivirus experimental operation. Precautions for handling and disposal of wasted lentivirus-contained medium were carried out according to its standard operating procedures. Our dressing seriously follow BSL-2 laboratory standard. Gloves, hats, masks, and eye shields and specialized lab-gown are are required to protect ourselves during the operation. Agarose gel analysis of DNA was performed with Ethidium bromide (EtBr) stain and always imaged safely in a gel doc. EtBr staining was performed safely with proper containment and disposal.  Our lab follow China National Institute of Pathogenic Microorganisms Biosafety Management and Lanzhou University Laboratory Safety Rules.
