For us, collaboration is a superpower that has produced incredible discoveries in the medical and scientific field.And it is the superpower that we can all turn to to inspire us to create something bigger than ourselves,that will help make the world a better place. Collaboration is the superpower that our team turn to, to help us fight cancer. And we are confident that with the right collaborations, we will beat this terrible disease.
							iGEM is a great platform for us to improve ourselves. Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. Not only we can gain experiences from our own project, but also by learning from other teams to spark more innovative inspiration. Throughout the course of our project, we interacted with many teams and helped each other out in meaningful ways. Here is a record of ours collaborations.

Together, we gave feedback on each other’s projects face to face in Shanghai’ s meeting.They helped us have a deeper understand of Model, and offered their suggestions about  our project design. And also, we proposed ours  idea about how to characterize their biobricks. Except the verbal communication, we do have experimental collaborations. As both our projects are related to exosome, which functions as a vehicle to carry target particles, we offered our exosome-booster biobrick when they get stuck in its construction. At the same time, they helped us finished our exosome-booster’s efficiency model.

Five groups came together and had a seminar, sharing participation experience. In the light of the difficult position faced by each team, participates put forward some paths for solving these problems. Besides, our seminar drew in several dozen students and teachers from different universities, which promoted the spread of iGEM and synthesis biology in China.
