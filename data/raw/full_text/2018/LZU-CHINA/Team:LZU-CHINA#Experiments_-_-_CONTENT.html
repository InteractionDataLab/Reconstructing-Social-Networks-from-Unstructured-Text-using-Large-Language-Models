							2. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 minute at room temperature.
							3. Decant or aspirate and discard the culture media.
							4. Add 250 µL Solution I/RNase A. Vortex or pipet up and down to mix thoroughly. Complete resuspension of cell pellet is vital for obtaining good yields.<B>Note: RNase A must be added to Solution I before use.</B>

							5. Transfer suspension into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
							6. Add 250 µL Solution II. Invert and gently rotate the tube several times to obtain a clear lysate. A 2-3 minute incubation may be necessary.
							Note: Avoid vigorous mixing as this will shear chromosomal DNA and lower plasmid purity. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed more than 5 minutes. Store Solution II tightly capped when not in use to avoid acidification from CO2 in the air.

							7. Add 350 µL Solution III. Immediately invert several times until a flocculent white precipitate forms.<B>Note: It is vital that the solution is mixed thoroughly and immediately after the addition of Solution III to avoid localized precipitation.</B>

							17. Centrifuge the empty HiBind® DNA Mini Column for 2 minutes at maximum speed to dry the column matrix.<B>Note: It is important to dry the HiBind® DNA Mini Column matrix before elution. Residual ethanol may interfere with downstream applications.</B>

							18. Transfer the HiBind® DNA Mini Column to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
							19. Add 15-30 μL Elution Buffer or deionized water directly to the center of the column membrane.<B>Note: The efficiency of eluting DNA from the HiBind® DNA Mini Column is dependent on pH. If eluting DNA with deionized water, make sure that the pH is around 8.5.</B>

							20. Let sit at room temperature for 2 minutes.
							21. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.<B>Note: This represents approximately 70% of bound DNA. An optional second elution will yield any residual DNA, though at a lower concentration.</B>
							22. Store DNA at -20°C.</P><H6 style="color: black">Enzyme Digestion</H6><P class="para2">1. Use Nanodrop to measure the concentration of gene fragments and plasmids
							2. Calculate digestion system’s concentration</P><P class="para2">3. Put the system in the Thermostatic Water Bath at 37℃ for 4h-12h
							4. Add 10×lodding Buffer to end the reaction
							5. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis , operating voltage 100V, 40 minutes
							6. Imaging in gel doc. Cut off the target band. DNA extraction.<B>Note: As mRFP fragment is located between Spel site and Xbal site, two bands would be obtained, cut off linear plasmid fragments band in which represents the length is around 2000bp.</B></P><H6 style="color: black">Enzyme Connection</H6><P class="para2">1. Connect the linear plasmid fragment and target gene fragment using T4 ligase offered by Takala company, following is the system component:
