Senthil Kumar</H2><SPAN class="pos">Professor &amp; Division Chair, Environmental &amp; Analytical Chemistry Division</SPAN><P>The CO<SUB>2</SUB> equilibrium is always established in nature. With the increase in CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions with industrialisation and
                    other anthropogenic actions, the overall CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration in the atmosphere has increased. Considering the equilibrium that nature is trying to establish as given below:
                
                From the above equation, it is clear that with increasing CO2 in the reactants, with respect to Le Chateliers principle, the forward reaction is favoured and there is more dissolved CO​2​. This establishment of equilibrium is what causes the increased CO2 level in the ocean and thereby leading to ocean acidification. Initially we had decided to use a system that facilitates an influx of carbonate/bicarbonate ions. Thankfully, our discussions with Dr.A.Senthil Kumar after almost 2 months of working brought in              light the fact that by using a system that removes products from the above reaction, will tend the reaction to move in the forward direction and that would mean we were doing the reverse of what we intended i.e., we were going to reduce the pH by dissolving more CO<SUB>2</SUB>.
               
               This was a major contribution after which we changed our system completely.

With decades of experience in the field, her insights on our project was a great                 contribution to view our idea in the bigger picture.She emphasised on the fact that the environment in                 even the different oceans were going to be different and that we have to work with specific areas to be able to get the native organism that we can possibly manipulate.</P><H2 class="ihp-heading">Dr. Sridharan T.

In his first year of observation, he saw a decline in the corals and its                   associated symbionts. But over the next two years of his observation, he saw the revival of the                symbionts suggesting that they were evolving according to the environmental changes. The result of              
                    his work suggests that similarly it is possible that over a period of time,an evolution might occur in                  organisms native to the ocean enabling them to resist the change in oceanic pH. He also suggested that                  we keep in mind that the metabolic pathways of the organism in concern should be sustainable in                 alkaline environment as well.</P><H2 class="ihp-heading">Dr. Punyasloke Bhadury</H2><SPAN class="pos">Associate Professor, Biological Sciences, IISER Kolkata</SPAN><P>Dr. Punyasloke Bhadury is a scientist who predominantly works on using biological systems to tackle               ocean acidification.

He gave us a                   deeper insight into our model. He was enthusiastic about the project and was in favour of using indigenous strains as they have a                  good doubling time and carbon dioxide capture capacity.He suggested that we also need to look into how the engineered strain will behave at different parts of                   the oceans, like at the coasts and further into the ocean. He also proposed a parallel mechanism that                  can work complementary to our existing system, of using Carbonic Anhydrase. He suggested that              express enzymes that are inherent to micro algae that can increase the efficiency of the whole                construct.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="horizontal"><DIV class="ihp-section"><H1 class="ihp-title">Choosing the suitable system</H1><H2 class="ihp-heading">Jabez Osborne</H2><SPAN class="pos">Assistant professor(senior) - Dept of Biosciences VIT, Vellore</SPAN><P>In our initial proposal, we had planned to use PhoBox promoter for sensing the external pH. This                 works using a periplasmic protein PhoR which phosphorylates PhoB that acts as the activator of the                PhoBox promoter leading to translation and expression of the necessary proteins to control the pH.In our discussion with Dr. Jabez , he asked us to check the activity range of the different proteins                   and promoter system involved in our project at varying factors like pH and temperature. When we did check for it, we found that the promoter is active at pH below 7. But the oceanic pH is around 8.So                      the PhoBox promoter wouldn’t work at that pH. This led to the modification of the idea into its                  current form.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="horizontal"><DIV class="ihp-section"><H1 class="ihp-title">Safety</H1><H2 class="ihp-heading">Everette Jacob Remington N</H2><SPAN class="pos">Associate Professor of School of Bio Sciences and Technology &amp; Member of Institutional Biosafety              Committee and Stem cell Research Committee</SPAN><P>His insights on safety regulations related to GMOs gave us a clearer picture on why regulation of our                  organism’s mechanism is of high importance.

Mr. Ishee is a passionate dog breeder who was stumped with the idea that there wasn’t a way to tackle                    an inherited disease in Dalmatians called hyperuricemia. Hence, he took it upon himself to find a way                 using genetic engineering as a tool and as inexpensively as possible. He started out his own venture to                  face this issue and has hence inspired several to use synthetic biology as a tool to face many problems.
 
                    We had a virtual conference with Mr. Ishee over Skype and he took us through his initial research                  with Dalmatians and the difficulties he faced with respect to rustic genetic engineering in his               home-lab. He talked us through the CRISPR technology and how unique and easy it was use it for                  modifying each strain. He also suggested how our organism of choice interacts withotherorganisms               in the native ecosystem and how it might affect our project.</P><H2 class="ihp-heading">Tamanna Sharma</H2><SPAN class="pos">Founder &amp; Director, Earthling First Private Limited</SPAN><P>Miss Tamanna Sharma is a Journalist by profession but was inspired to start her venture when she                 recognized that the waste management was a serious issue that needs to be tackled. This laid the                 foundation for Earthling First, Miss Tamanna’s own venture to a better and a sustainable future.               Earthling First has collaborated with various initiatives by the Government of India.
                Our talk with Miss Tamanna Sharma was very insightful and enriching. Even as she was not an expert                  in the field of genetic engineering or its related fields, her experience working with nature and the                 people affected by the disasters caused by man, made her a very resourceful person.Even as Miss Sharma was against the concept of genetic engineering as it was a lot against nature, she                   conceded that it could be beneficial if done safely and keeping in mind that the natural systems are not                   to be tampered with to a large extent or in the future. She was favourable to our idea of using synthetic                     biology to tackle Ocean Acidification as the phenomenon was a man-made disaster and it was up to us                  humans to find a solution too.
                She firmly said before any actual release of any of our engineered organism into the natural oceanic                 waters, we need to simulate how our organism would respond to the such environments and this                should be done by taking oceanic waters were taken as a sample for simulation. Moreover, she was                 cautioned us about how our engineered organism could potentially affect the natural balance of the               marine ecosystem and that too needs to be monitored and simulated carefully before any release into                the natural waters. It really is true that experience is the best teacher!
