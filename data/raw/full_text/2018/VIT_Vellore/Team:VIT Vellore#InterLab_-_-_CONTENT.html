Fluorescein, a reporter, is targeted for the studies performed this year as the intensity observed directly correlates with the number of cells that are producing it. However, the comparison among the data provided by different labs is difficult due to two major reasons: Different units of reporting the data and different ways of processing the raw data so as to suit the labs.However, iGEM measurement committee this year has taken great steps to turn this into reality.</P><P class="team-description">Initially, there were three basic calibration steps that needed to be followed.</P><H2 class="main-h2">Reference point protocol</H2><UL class="square-type-list"><LI>This protocol is used in conversion of the Abs<SUB>600</SUB> values to OD<SUB>600</SUB> values</LI><LI>This is necessary because the Abs readings are volume-dependent.
