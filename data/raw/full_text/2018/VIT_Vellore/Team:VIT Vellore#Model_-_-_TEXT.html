Mathematical modelling gives us a better insight of our synthetic biology                 system. Using mathematical equations, it helps us analyse and reconstruct our system prior to performing the experiment practically. It predicts the responses                 of our biobricks and aids us in approaching the experiment in a well-informed                 and clear manner. Thus, before beginning our experimental work, we simulated                 a virtual model of our system using Matlab, in order to check the effectiveness                 of our proposed theory.
Purpose
Our model depicts how extracellular concentration of H+ ions in the                 surrounding oceanic environment would alter the level of protein production in our system.
The main objective was to investigate how different concentrations of the                 proteins are produced at different pH levels due to the activation and repression                 of the respective promoters through a series of kinetic equations.
Method
The model predicted the performance of the pCadA and pNhaA promoters. It                 also predicts the interactions between their protein products resulting in                 activation or repression of these promoters.
We applied ordinary differential equations using Hills equation with already                 existing parameters obtained from literature to estimate the effect of                 extracellular pH on PNhaA and pcadA promoters.
Hills Equation
Hills equation helps measure the degree of interaction between a ligand and it                 binding sites. We have used hills equation kinetics to model the regulatory                 system of our engineered plasmid.

Our Genetic Circuit
Response of promoters in varying pH
pNhaA and pCadA promoters are pH sensitive. Hence, we simulated models depicting the responses of the pCadA and pNhaA  promoters at varying extracellular pH levels applying Hills equation with the parameters taken from literature(Refer Table 1).
pNhaA promoter behaviour
Here, the expression of lexA protein increases with increasing pH. This is in accordance with our proposed model.
pCadA promoter behaviour
Here, we can clearly see that the pCadA expression shown by the reporter decreases with increase in pH, which is also in accordance with our proposed model.
