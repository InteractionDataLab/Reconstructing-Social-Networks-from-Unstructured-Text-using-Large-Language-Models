We gave the lab work and project requirement utmost importance when it came to safety by                 carefully studying protocols and accordingly preparing our work surroundings for safe and successful                 execution of the project experiments.                 Since the project is going to be carried in the laboratory under controlled environment, the safety                 requirements are going to be minimal.
TogglepH is a revolutionary technology that requires deft and responsible handling. It is inherently                 safe to use as none of its components are toxic to living beings and the engineered sequences do not                 produce any unwanted responses. Despite its safe nature, it is important to use this remediation                 tool with care so that the balance of the ocean is not adversely affected.
Environmental Safety
Our entire solution is based on safe microorganisms which solve the problem of ocean acidification                 which we humans have caused. Our safe and friendly workers contain no sequences which may                 cause secretion of toxic substances or cause the microbe to become toxic to the marine life in the                 ocean. Special care has been taken to assess the growth of our microbes in order to prevent them                 from replicating excessively and disturbing the biological load of the ocean. Environmental safety is                 something we that we kept in mind right from the start since our solution aims to restore the                 balance of nature which we have disturbed. It aims at creating a better, healthier and cleaner                 environment for all us by solving the cosmopolitan problem of ocean acidification.
Lab Safety
We used a Biosafety level 1 laboratory since we were working with E. Coli DH5α. All of us adhered to                 strict safety protocols including but not limited to autoclaving glassware before and after use,                 wearing disposable personal protective equipment and we prohibited all food items inside the lab.                 This enabled us to work with constitutively with high competency all the while ensuring that we                 produce credible results. Being college students, we were already familiar with the lab conditions of                 the area and hence augmented with the aforementioned rules, we were able to set up a truly                 efficient, safe and efficacious workplace.
To meet the personal protection aspect, we were given the safety introduction for the facilities in                 our laboratory by the laboratory in-charge. Explanations of centrifuges, incubators, fume hoods as                 well as waste disposal of aqueous and organic liquids are one of the few basic examples explained to                 us thoroughly.
As E. Coli DH5α do not represent a particular danger as compared to other biosafety level 1                 organisms, personal protection with lab coats, glasses and gloves are sufficient for safety purposes.                 General protocols used
1. Ethanol was used to sterilize surfaces.
2. Autoclaving of equipment before and after use was performed.
3. All work done with microbes was done in a laminar air flow chamber.
4. Eyewear/masks were used while working with microbes.
5. Lab coats and gloves were mandatorily used during the execution of our experimental protocols.
6. Personal protective equipment to be autoclaved after every day of lab work to prevent                 contamination.
7. Prohibition of consumption food stuffs and drinks in the lab.
Ethidium Bromide: This compound is a potent mutagen and is moderately toxic after an acute                 exposure. Working was performed in an active fume hood wearing personal protective equipment                 (PPE) to minimize the chance of exposure. We disposed it off in accordance to the safety disposal                 regulations.
UV light: We utilized the UV light in the fume hood as well as for both to sanitize our containers in                 addition to equipment (counting Gibson pipettes, petri-plates, pipette tips, glasswares etc) and to                 watch and cut out gels. Our colleagues wore protective glasses to avoid any kind of harmful                 exposure.
Additional personal protection: Enclosed footwear were made available and mandatory to minimize                 the possibility of skin exposure with harmful substances. Also, before leaving the lab, the team made                 sure to prevent the external environment contamination by disinfecting their clothing.                 Chemical safety: Proper storage for both flammable and potentially hazardous chemicals, as well as                 proper working methods for the required working environment protocols to handle respective                 substances: example working in an active fume hood ,use and storage of acids etc.                 In case of an emergency, safety showers, eyewashes and hand washes, fire extinguishers in addition                 to a nearby facility in case of serious injury were made easily accessible.
Ethical, Legal and Social Issues (ELSI)
All ELSI raised during our numerous presentations were countered successfully with facts and a                 general acceptance of those facts was achieved throughout the spectrum. In future, a local body                 within our college can be set up to address these ELSI which may arise from time to time.
Responsibility
Since our product is a genetically modified organism, we are committed to working with the                 regulatory authorities in order to ensure that our product is completely safe. We intend to perform                 multi-site testing in synthetic environments to assess all the repercussions of introducing our                 product into the ocean. Only once all avenues have been considered will we make a move towards                 pushing for its wider acceptance amongst the general public.
