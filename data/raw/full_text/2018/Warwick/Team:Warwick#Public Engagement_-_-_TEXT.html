Public Engagement
Public engagement and education play a big part in iGEM, with the acceptance of synthetic biology only being possible through education and increased awareness. This is why our team conducted various educational and outreach events in order to tackle this “psychological fear of the unknown” and also try to encourage acceptance of our project’s technologies. We did this through multiple outreach channels. We hosted various educational sessions whereby we went to schools in both Malaysia and the United Kingdom to spoke to school children about the different applications of synthetic biology. We conducted an international survey to assess people’s attitudes towards synthetic biology products. Based on the survey results, we were able to draw up an “East vs West” study where we could investigate whether culture or race differences play a part in affecting the acceptance rate of synthetic biology. In our “Psychology of Risk Perception” study, we further explored the psychological causes behind the rejection of synthetic biology, alongside hosting an ethics roundtable session on live radio.  Furthermore, we compiled an intellectual property guidebook where we emphasised the development of blockchain in the IP sector. In addition, we realised the problem with iGEM’s lack of publicity in Southeast Asia. Hence, we decided that the best way to remedy this was to publish a experience journal detailing the journeys of iGEM participants who majored in degrees other than the conventional iGEM-related degrees such as biology and chemistry. We hoped that with this guidebook, which can be found on our “Publicity” tab, we are able to serve as an inspiring example to future teams. As part of our educational outreach targeting young children, we also developed a video game and produced a guide on how to communicate synthetic biology to children. Finally, we wrote a policy brief that combined the research we had consolidated regarding the different approaches to governance of synthetic biology, in order to provide an assessment of the current legislation in place and offered recommendations of improvement.
