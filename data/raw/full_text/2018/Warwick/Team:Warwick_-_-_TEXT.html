Why water safety?
Access to safe water is among the many crises we face as a growing population. The WHO estimates that 2.1 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services (http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/water/) , and it is estimated that $260B lost globally each year due to lack of basic water. source
When we tried to break down this problem, we were overwhelmed by the many different types of contaminants in water, each of which require different approaches to their removal. We decided to look into how to remove on of each in three main sub-categories of contaminants: Biological, Organic and Inorganic.
Looking into this event, we realised there were many different types of contaminants in water, each of which require different approaches to their removal. We decided to look into how to remove on of each in three main sub-categories of contaminants: Biological, Organic and Inorganic.
Three very different problems: Lead, Legionella and Oestrogen.
We are tackling the bioremediation of waters, focusing on three water pollutants in particular: the organic (oestrogen), inorganic (lead) and biological (legionella). Core concepts of synthetic biology were used create circuits which degrade, remove and detect these pollutants respectively.
Our projects are ambitious and attempt to solve a wide range of problems that aren’t connected to each other by a unified solution, and that’s not what we are trying to come up with. Each of these areas we have invested in were chosen based on the resources we had as a university in terms of expertise, equipment and experience.
