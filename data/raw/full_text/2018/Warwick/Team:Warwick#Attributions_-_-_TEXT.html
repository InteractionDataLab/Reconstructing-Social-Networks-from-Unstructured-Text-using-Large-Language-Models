Dr. Christophe Corre
Our teams lab supervisor. He gave us access to his lab when we needed it, helped us with shipping our parts, supported us in the develop of our ideas and found us contacts throughout the department.
Dr. Corinne Hanlon
Our teams supervisor. From safety forms to finance, she did it all. Dedicated a substantial amount of her time to us, made sure iGEM could exist. The fundamental pillar which Warwick iGEM relies on.
Geraldine Keene
Gave us lab space, helped introduce us to lab safety, let us use every piece of lab equipment: pipettes, nanodrops, incubators, spectrophotometers, centrifuges, everything.
Clare Hayes
Our teams lab guru. Spent the entirety of iGEM supporting us and helping us with our project, both wet lab and dry lab, theory and practice. Instrumental in the Bacillus plasmid design. Directed our project at meetings.
Dr. Emzo De Los Santos
Helped guide our project, instrumental in the Bacillus plasmid design. Gave us advice on our presentation skills. Directed our project at meetings.
Robert Ramirez Garcia
Provided us with MG1655-Z1 cells, helped us get our cells working, influenced the design of our system. Instrumental in the development of the Riboregulated dCAS9. Directed our project at meetings.
Eduardo Goicoechea
Helped us locate archived cells and obtain them, helped us with obtaining sequences and data from archived projects.
Mr Satya Prakash
Taught us how to use the fluorometer, gave us advice on growing our Z1 cells. Let us use the nanodrop, incubator and shaking incubator.
Prof. Alfonso Jaramillo
Let us use his lab, provided us with riboregulated dCAS9 design and optimisation data, helped us to design the circuit, taught us about Nupack, allowed us to use his research paper and plasmids.
Jack Ho
Let us use his lab, provided us with riboregulated dCAS9 design and optimisation data, helped us to design the circuit, taught us about Nupack, allowed us to use his research paper and plasmids.
Marco Delise
Let us use his lab, provided us with riboregulated dCAS9 design and optimisation data, helped us to design the circuit, taught us about Nupack, allowed us to use his research paper and plasmids.
Alexander Darlington
Supported our model design. Directed our project at meetings.
Dr. John McCarthy
Head of WISB, advised our presentation, helped find us support from all over the department.
Dr. Robert Spooner
Helped to modify and finetune our presentation for a wide range of audiences.
Daniel Taylor
Helped in model development. Supported our team at the Oxford Meetup. Directed our project at meetings.
Audam Chhun
Provided support in generating and reading LCMS results. Helped with the characterisation of the Oestrogen degrading enzymes.
Special thanks to John N. Duncan, William Rostain, and Alfonso Jaramillo for their work on Riboregulated dCAS9 and their plasmids PAJ379 and PAJ390, which were instrumental in our project design and their RNA-dependent control of CRISPRi regulation research paper.
