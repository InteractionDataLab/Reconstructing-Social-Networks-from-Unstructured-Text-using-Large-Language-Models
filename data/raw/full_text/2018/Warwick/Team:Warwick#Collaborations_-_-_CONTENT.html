                                       At the Oxford University SynBioCDT meet-up we asked multiple other UK iGEM teams to send us samples of water so we could measure the concentration of oestrogen and check for dangerous levels, while simultaneously looking for bacteria that already contained the oestrogen degrading pathways seen in Taiwan.

                                       Hello iGEM Teams,It's been a long, exciting and no doubt exhausting Summer. We have come a long way from the water samples you provided us in the Oxford Meet-up! You might be wondering what we did with them: Initially we tested the oestrogen concentration of the water, and found it to be too low for us to detect. In parallel with this we used the water samples to isolate bacteria we thought might possess the ability to degrade oestrogen. The behaviour of the circuit found in the sample isolated in Taiwan (2017) was not imitated by any bacteria from the water samples collected throughout the United Kingdom. Through these water samples we have expanded our understanding on just how rare these degradation circuits can be for such a common molecule as Oestrogen. We have all come a long way this Summer, and we wouldn't be here without you.
Thank you for helping us,The Warwick iGEM Team
The team that sent us water samples are: Univeristy of Exeter, University College London, Cardiff University, University of Nottingham, Newcastle University. A big thanks to all these teams for collaborating with us and sending water samples to us.
                                   </P></DIV><DIV class="Contents" id="Content3"><H2>Oxford</H2><P style="width: 90%">Oxford and Warwick shared DNA with one another - after both teams required more plasmids from each others kitplates, we filled in a few safety forms, met up and exchanged DNA. We were looking for help with our mathematical modelling and Oxford university were open to supporting us. They taught us how to create a hill function for our construct, and what information a hill function could transfer. See our <A href="2018.igem.org/Team:Warwick/Model">modelling page</A> for more.</P></DIV><DIV class="Contents" id="Content5"><H2>Imperial College London</H2><P style="width: 90%">We helped to develop their Communication Strategies Guide by giving feedback</P></DIV><H2>iGEM IIT Madras</H2><P>The IIT Madras team approached us as they needed our help in translating the synthetic biology videos we were making. A member of our team, June Ong, alongside Robert Garcia, the research assistant help translate their videos into the Malay and Catalan language respectively. In return, they helped us in publicising our “public perception of synthetic biology” survey in India which gave us really good insights for our East meets West study.</P><H2>iGEM Stockholm</H2><P>Recognising that many of our outreach objectives were aimed at engaging more young people and children in synthetic biology, we chose to work with iGEM Stockholm to test and reflect on our communication methods. We first did this by trialling iGEM Stockholm’s childrens book at a regional ‘Family Fun Day’ event where we collected qualitative feedback from families and children on their book. We then decided to deepen our collaboration by producing a guide on communicating synthetic biology to children, designed for educators and the iGEM, as well as the wider synthetic biology community, to understand some of the insights our teams jointly gained over our summers of public engagement.</P><H2>Turkey HS Ankara </H2><P>We mentored a Turkish High School team during the summer by skyping them regularly over the summer to answer any of their questions and taught them how to use tools such as Benchling. We were on hand to answer any of their questions about synthetic biology techniques and BioBricks and also provided general support via messaging.</P><H2>Imperial College London</H2><P>After holding skype calls with Imperial iGEM, we advised them on how to improve their science communication guide. We tested it out for our own purposes and used our own experiences of science communication this summer to provide them with feedback.
We also trialled out Imperial’s team communication app within our team to test how the app works in an iGEM team dynamic, this feedback was again circulated back to Imperial so they could improve their app.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer"><DIV id="leftFoot"><H1 class="FooterTitle" style="margin: 15px auto">Contact Us</H1><DIV id="socialmedia"><H1 style="color: white; font-weight: 300; font-size: 1.5vw;">igem@warwick.ac.uk</H1></DIV></DIV><DIV id="rightFoot"><H1 class="FooterTitle" style="color: black">Sponsors</H1></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
