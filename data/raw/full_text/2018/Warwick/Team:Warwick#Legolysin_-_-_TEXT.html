Legolysin
Legolysin is a surface membrane lipoprotein involved in toxic hemolysis activity. The protein contains a BON domain which is capable of binding to the surface membrane of cells. The sequence shares extensive similarity with a virulence protein from a characterised strain of Legionella Pneumophila known to be involved in pathogenic activity.
The protein was selected as a target for the Legionella detection gRNA by the 2018 Warwick iGEM team due to the fact that BLAST analysis performed on the ORF Nucleotide sequence shows high conservation to Legionella strains (left), but not to any other bacteria (right).
