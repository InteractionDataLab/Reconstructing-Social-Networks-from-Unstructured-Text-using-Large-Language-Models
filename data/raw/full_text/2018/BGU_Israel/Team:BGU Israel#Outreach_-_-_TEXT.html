Outreach
Throughout work on our iGEM project this past year, our team appeared in local newspapers, national morning TV shows, and organized events to raise public awareness about ALS. Through these channels and social media, we aimed to inspire the public about the potential of synthetic biology to solve world problems and the potential of our iGEM project to help ALS patients. Furthermore, a press release and additional outreach will follow during the Giant Jamboree, with the help of the communication department of our university. For further information, please visit our Facebook and Twitter pages.

AddGene Podcast
Avital Bailen, an OriginALS team member, visited the Addgene headquarters in Boston on April 2, 2018. Addgene, a leading non-profit biological resource center, provides key materials used in laboratory research. During this visit, Avital recorded a podcast where Dr. Kim De Mora, Addgene Business Development Analyst and a former iGEM judge, interviewed Avital about iGEM, the OriginALS project, and the challenges the team could face during the coming year.
We would like to thank Addgene’s CEO, Dr. Joanne Kamens, Dr. Kim De Mora, and all of the Addgene staff for this great opportunity and wonderful podcast! Listen to the podcast featured on Addgene’s blog!

IGEM with a beer in a popular student local pub
On Monday, May 21, 2018 the OriginALS team hosted the "iGEM on the Bar" event. We invited friends, colleagues and the public to an evening lecture at a local pub in Beer Sheva. At this event, our team gave a presentation about iGEM, the OriginALS project, and the upcoming annual ALS fundraising race.
We began by explaining what this new field of synthetic biology is all about. Then we delved into the ALS disease and how our project aims to slow its progression. Next, we described to the audience the uniqueness of the ALS community in Israel. We ended this event by inviting our guests to join us and participate in the annual ALS fundraising race with the OriginALS team.
At the end of our presentation, the OriginALS team- members mingled with the guests answering questions and discussing the project.

A Meeting with Tzvika Levi
At the ALS race closing ceremony, several patients shared their experiences with the disease. One of the patients who spoke was Tzvika Levi. Tzvika is known in Israel as the “father of the lone soldiers” due to his tireless support of and advocation for lone soldiers. Lone soldiers are soldiers whose families are not in the country or are not able to care for them during the child’s mandatory army service in the Israel Defense Forces. Tzvika recently won the president’s award for outstanding Israeli citizens due to this work.
Avital Bailen, an iGEM team member, has known Tvika since she was a lone soldier herself. At the onset of the OriginALS project, Avital visited Tzvika and his corageuous wife Naomi, and wrote the following about that experience:
I first met Tzvika when I was eighteen years old, freshly out of high-school and a few months after making Aliya to Israel. By that time, Tzvika was already a legend to lone soldiers. We had heard countless stories about Tzvika “saving the day” when there was nobody else to turn to; helping people get into the army units they were interested in, connecting them to adopted families, or just checking up on them to say hi. I didn’t know it at the time, but I too would make a phone call one day to Tzvika when I was in need.
I had served in a co-ed infantry combat unit for almost 3 years and was looking forward to my discharge vacation, a few weeks of paid vacation given to combat soldiers as a token of appreciation for their service. I was having some difficulty with my Brigade Commander, a very high-ranking officer, who insisted on revoking my discharge vacation. Frustrated by the situation, I decided to try and contact Tzvika to see if he could help.
Tzvika seemed really calm as I explained the situation. When I finished, he simply said “Ok, let’s see what we can do, I’ll call you back.” Less than ten minutes later Tzvika called back and said, “I talked to your commander, the problem is solved.” As a lone soldier, with few connections and little influence, this was amazing. A huge relief to have someone looking out for me when for so long you have learned to rely on yourself.
Meeting with Tzvika, years later, as part of the iGEM research project, was very meaningful. When I first walked in I began by introducing myself. Tzvika smiled and immediately said “I remember you!”. I was amazed he had remembered me after all these years and after taking care of thousands of lone soldiers over the years. While it was difficult to see Tzvika looking frail and sick, I watched in amazement as he used his computer to type with his eye movements and communicate. When I asked him how he is doing, he answered “I am still helping lone soldiers.”
We continued to catch up as I shared the details of our research project and listened as Tzvika shared his experience with ALS. Looking back on that meeting, I am truly honored and excited to rekindle my friendship with Tzvika and involve him in the 2018 BGU-iGEM team!
Youth Science Center visit
On Thursday, August 2, 2018 a group of twenty students from the Choosidman Youth Science Center visited our lab. This high-achieving group of high-school students participated in a two-week Science workshop during their summer vacation.
As part of this workshop, they visited our lab and were taught about iGEM and the OriginALS project. After the introduction, we gave the students a tour of the lab and explained some of the processes we use in order to implement our ideas, such as plasmid cloning methods and how cell-lines are maintained. The students were especially excited to learn about the high-school iGEM track.
We encouraged them to investigate the option of putting together an iGEM team at their local schools. It was a pleasure to host these talented students who had excellent and insightful questions!

OriginALS Animation
As part of our goal to make the OriginALS idea accessible to the public, we created a short animation video which provides a visual aid to understanding the scientific aspects of the project.
We tried to be very precise with our video message and invested a great deal of effort in order to get people excited about this idea, yet avoid spreading false hopes to ALS patients and their families.
We hope you enjoy and learn something new!
