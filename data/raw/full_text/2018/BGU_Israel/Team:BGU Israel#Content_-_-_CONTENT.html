Many ideas were proposed but one idea resonated with us. Liat Tsoran, one of our team members, told us her personal story. Liat’s father, Nir Tsoran, was diagnosed with ALS when Liat was only eleven years old. For seven years (longer than the average patient’s survival rate), Liat witnessed her father’s health, deteriorates from a fully functional adult to a man trapped inside his body. Throughout his ordeal, Nir did not let his disease prevent him from being an exemplary father and advocate. He served as the CEO of IsrALS, an Israeli non-profit organization committed to supporting ALS patients, their families, and promoting ALS research in Israel. Nir took this budding non-profit and the very small Israeli ALS scientific community and turned it into an influential strong local movement. Since her father’s diagnosis, Liat has been dedicating her life to understanding the disease and hopes, to one day contribute to finding a cure. Once we heard Liat’s story, the whole team enlisted to join her efforts. We suddenly understood that the “Ice Bucket Challenge” was not just a fun activity but a necessary step in bringing awareness to a devastating disease which has not received the exposure required to promote significant research for a cure.
