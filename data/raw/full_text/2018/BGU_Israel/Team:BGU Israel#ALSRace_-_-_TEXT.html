“Friend4ALS” Funding Race
<
On Thursday July 6, 2018 the OriginALS team participated in the “Annual Race for ALS Patients”. All donations collected went directly towards promoting ALS research and supporting ALS patients and their families.
Leading up to the race, the OriginALS team dedicated itself to fundraising for this great cause. Each team member asked family and friends to sponsor them in the race. Additionally, we embarked on a social media and a poster campaign around the university to recruit both donations and additional race participants. We followed this up with a sign-up booth located in the student union building, in which we took shifts for several days personally approaching students and encouraging them to donate and join the race.
The proceeds from the iGEM on the Bar event were used to subsidize fellow students’ race admissions fee, providing an additional incentive to participate. Also, we must thank Ben- Gurion University for sponsoring free transportation to and from the event. Through these combined efforts, we were able to collect a respectable sum and add twenty students to our race delegation.
On the day of the race, our team assisted with the race route and event area set-up. Once the event began, we helped with participant registration and handed out the official t- shirts. After the race, we assisted with handing out medals, water, and popsicles to the runners. Of course, our team ran in the race as well (we had trained by running from the lab to the fluorescent microscope in the adjacent building).
During this event we had the opportunity to meet ALS patients and talk with their families, hearing how they confront the disease on a day to day basis. The event was very meaningful for our team, as we met the people who we would potentially be helping, giving us motivation to move forward with our project.
