Colorado School Of Mines Collaboration
Our team teamed up with Colorado School of Mines to collaborate and give feedback on our projects so far. Though our projects were very different, it helped to have an outsiders point of view. They asked questions that made us think about our overall design and application and we got experience presenting. Presenting to them was trial run for the big presentation at the iGEM Jamboree. We also helped them with a part of their project that used non-canonical amino acids since our team had experience with that.
