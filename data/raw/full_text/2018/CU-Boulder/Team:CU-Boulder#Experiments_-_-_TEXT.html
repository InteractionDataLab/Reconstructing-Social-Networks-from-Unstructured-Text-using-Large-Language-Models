Protein Gel Staining
1. Gels electrophoresed with MOPS or MES running buffers must be prefixed with a 50% methanol and 7% acetic acid solution for     15 minutes and then washed with ultrapure water to remove fixing solution. GelCode Blue Stain penetrates prefixed gels     better than non-fixed gels and, therefore, standard SDS-PAGE gels may also be prefixed with good results. 2. Wash SDS-PAGE or native PAGE gels as follows: • SDS-PAGE: After electrophoresis, place gel in a clean tray and rinse 3 × 5     minutes with 100-200mL of ultrapure water. Alternatively, wash gel in 1-2L of ultrapure water with gentle shaking for 15     minutes. 3. Mix the GelCode Blue Stain Reagent solution immediately before use by gently inverting or tipping and swirling the bottle     several times. Do not shake bottle to mix the solution. 4. Add 20mL of GelCode Blue Stain Reagent for an 8 × 10cm mini gel. Use more reagent as needed if using a large tray. Gently     shake tray and periodically monitor protein band development. Stain intensity reaches a maximum within approximately 1     hour. Gels may be stained overnight without increasing background. 5. To destain (water wash enhancement step) gel, replace Stain Reagent with ultrapure water. For optimal results, change water     several times for 1-2 hours. This step enhances stain sensitivity, as weak protein bands continue to develop.

Electroporate PCR
1. Prepare 17 mm x 100 mm round-bottom culture tubes (e.g. VWR #60818-667) at room temperature. Place SOC recovery medium in a     37°C water bath. Pre-warm selective plates at 37°C for 1 hour. 2. Place electroporation cuvettes (1 mm) and microcentrifuge tubes on ice. 3. As a positive control for transformation, dilute the control pUC19 by 1:5 to a final concentration of 10 pg/μl using     sterile water. Heat-denatured ligation reactions can be used for electroporation directly; however, column purification is     recommended. 4. Thaw NEB Turbo Electrocompetent cells on ice (about 10 min) and mix cells by flicking gently. Transfer 25 μl of the cells     (or the amount specified for the cuvettes) to a chilled microcentrifuge tube. Add 1 μl of the DNA solution. 5. Carefully transfer the cell/DNA mix into a chilled cuvette without introducing bubbles and make sure that the cells deposit     across the bottom of the cuvette. Electroporate using the following conditions for BTX ECM 630 and Bio-Rad GenePulser     electroporators: 2.1 kV,    100 Ω, and 25 μF. The typical time constant is ~2.6 milliseconds. 6. Immediately add 975 µl of 37°C SOC to the cuvette, gently mix up and down twice, then transfer to the 17 mm x 100 mm round-     bottom culture tube. 7. Shake vigorously (250 rpm) or rotate at 37°C for 1 hour. 8. Dilute the cells as appropriate then spread 100-200 μl cells onto a pre-warmed selective plate. 9. Incubate plates 8 hours to overnight at 37°C.  set machine to 1.8V place cuvette in machine press both pulse buttons for 3 seconds, you should hear a beep after If you hear a pop or see a flash your culture has arched. This means one of a few things, your cell concentration is too high, dilute with 10% glycerol. Your DNA is not pure, either used less or use another DNA stock. Or both of the previous issue is present. Add 600ul of LB to the cuvette (or 250ul of SOC) and pipette up and down, take out some culture and grow on a shaker for 1 hour Place culture on selective plate
