Gibson Assembly
1.Set up the following reaction on ice:
2-3 Fragment Assembly
4-6 Fragment Assembly

* Optimized cloning efficiency is 50–100 ng of vectors with 2–3 fold of excess inserts. Use 5 times more of inserts if size is less than 200 bps. Total volume of unpurified PCR fragments in Gibson Assembly reaction should not exceed 20%. ** Control reagents are provided for 5 experiments. *** If greater numbers of fragments are assembled, additional Gibson Assembly Master Mix may be required.
2.Incubate samples in a thermocycler at 50°C for 15 minutes when 2 or 3 fragments are being assembled or 60 minutes when 4-6 fragments are being assembled. Following incubation, store samples on ice or at -20°C for subsequent transformation.
Gel Electrophoresis
500 mL of TAE Buffer
1. Add 10 mL of TAE buffer
2. 490 mL of D.I. water
1% gel
1. Add 0.5 g of Agarose
2. Add 50 mL of TAE
3. Microwave for 1 min and 45 sec
4. Let it sit until room temperature
5. Add 5 uL of SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain
6. Swirl Solution
7. Pour gel into cast
8. Let it sit for 20 minutes.
Loading of gel

Plastic Weighing: We weighed the plastic particles with the laboratory weighing scale before and after inoculation with transformed E. coli+Media.
Scanning Electron Microscopy: This is part of our future directions.
