We've got people. We've got teamwork. We've got trips to adventureland. We've got trips to Taco Bell. We've got trips to Taco Bell. Take a few moments out of your day to bask in the glorious grid of colors and pictures that is our team. I can't come up with any more filler text.

Mechanical Engineering
</STRONG>As the other glorious leader of our team, Matt (aka Elon) always manages to look enitrely cool and composed in front of every and any problem we encounter. This is likely due to his lifelong dream of becoming a pirate, since pirates need perfect composure out on sea. However, the ocean is not the only area Matt would love to explore, he also enjoys the more land based activity of hiking.

When she is not spending inordinate amounts of time in lab or studying organic chemistry, Priya enjoys roasting other team members (Lin) and watching various anime shows.

Outside of the lab she works as an RA, attempting to teach freshmen how to adult while struggling to do the same herself.

</STRONG>Although she may look harmless, Sara is not to be underestimated. As the most badass of us all, Sara was always ready to take anyone on in a game of cards. Besides winning those card games, Sara likes to show off her crafty skills through DIY projects and listen to some hip-hop in the meantime.

Biology</STRONG>We can confidently say Jennifer is the most organized and put together member of our team. Motivated and ready to kick our butts into gear at any time, Jennifer always kept us on task. She always brightens up our days, and our outreach events, by bringing Gosha, her parrot (and our honorary iGEM member). When not in lab, Jennifer is an active athlete on the Rowing Team, a member of the Marching Band Color Guard, and the iGEM Photographer.
