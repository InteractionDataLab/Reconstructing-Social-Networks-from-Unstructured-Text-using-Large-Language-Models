                    From exchanging lab protocols to making an instructional video, and even hosting our very own Instagram challenge, the Stony Brook iGEM team has collaborated with over fifteen teams across the world, sharing deep bonds and bringing everyone together. We knew from the start that an iGEM project is not just about pumping out results on our own, but is rather about a global community coming together, and mutually enjoying the ride. The Stony Brook iGEM team wanted to give every team the same enthusiasm and passion we gave to our project, for the goal of furthering the advancement of synthetic biology research. The collaborations have been extremely helpful towards our experiment, and we cannot be where we are today without them.  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class="mbr-section article content1 cid-r4GueTfmyZ" id="content1-1i"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="media-container-row"><DIV class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-5">Directed Evolution Education with Queens University iGEM</DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="mbr-section article content1 cid-r6vELm3EXP" id="content1-gm"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="media-container-row"><DIV class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><P>We initially wanted to use directed evolution (DE) to select for cyanobacteria that produced large quantities of sugar. However, we had limited knowledge of DE techniques. Luckily for us, the QGem iGEM team also wanted to use DE in their project and reached out to us. We soon set up a video call and discussed ways we could collaborate.  
</P><DIV>We learned about how QGem wanted to use error-prone PCR to generate copies of their cortisol-detection circuit and produce a more sensitive detector. We told QGem about how we wanted to use in-vivo UV mutagenesis in combination with Megazyme’s Sucrose D-glucose assay to create mutations and screen variants with the greatest yields of sugar. As we were discussing our projects, we soon realized the breadth of DE techniques and the lack of simple, organized information on the topic.
</DIV><DIV>We decided that working on a simple, organized Directed Evolution resource would be the best use of our time and a great resource for future iGEM teams. Both teams worked together on gathering information, script writing, and recording audio. QGEM filmed the video, and iGEM Stony Brook edited the video and added additional graphics. We hope that future iGEM teams can use these resources as a starting point and an encouragement for implementing DE into their projects!  </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="mbr-section content8 cid-r6d6RqtOMm" id="content8-3o"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="media-container-row title"><DIV class="col-12 col-md-8"><DIV class="mbr-section-btn align-center"><A class="btn btn-secondary display-4" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Queens_Canada/Collaborations" target="_blank"><STRONG>Collaborations Page</STRONG></A><A class="btn btn-secondary display-4" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2018/7/7f/T--Stony_Brook--Collaboration_directed_evolution_pamplet.pdf" target="_blank"><STRONG>Pamphlet</STRONG></A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="mbr-section article content1 cid-r4GwjdKH1x" id="content1-1l"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="media-container-row"><DIV class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-5">Instagram Challenge</DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="mbr-section article content1 cid-r6vENQxJ5z" id="content1-gn"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="media-container-row"><DIV class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">In an effort to present our iGEM projects to communities in an interesting and creative way, we created an Instagram Challenge!

They were trying to establish a co-culture of <I> S. elongatus </I>, <I> E. coli </I>, and <I> S. cerevisiae </I>. Due to our shared goal, we exchanged a variety of information from culturing conditions to genetic assembly methods. We also sent a few articles that discussed co-culture that we found helpful for our project, and extensively discussed it with Dusseldorf iGEM.
</P><DIV>In addition to the similarity between our projects, we were also both honored to receive an Opentrons OT-2 robot from Opentrons. Unfortunately, at the time of discussion, they have not yet received their Opentrons robot, so we wholeheartedly offered to run any protocols on the Opentrons that they wanted to test out. In return, they offered to let us try out a cyanobacteria gene circuit in their co-culture apparatus. However, due to time constraints and the extensive shipping process, we could not prepare and ship the gene circuit to Dusseldorf.
</DIV><DIV>Furthermore, we were incredibly excited to collaborate with HHU Dusseldorf in their mission to send postcards to bolster public awareness of synthetic biology and allow teams to introduce themselves and their projects before the Giant Jamboree. We designed our postcard to have gumballs (as we are The Sucrose Factory) and described our project briefly on the back. After we shipped one hundred postcards, we received a stack of postcards from other teams, as well as a stack of our own postcards with the address of other participating teams on them.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="mbr-section content8 cid-r6d8SLRtIL" id="content8-3x"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="media-container-row title"><DIV class="col-12 col-md-8"><DIV class="mbr-section-btn align-center"><A class="btn btn-secondary display-4" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Duesseldorf/Collaborations" target="_blank">Collaborations Page</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="carousel slide cid-r6doUvHjCj" data-interval="false" id="slider2-5g"><DIV class="container content-slider"><DIV class="content-slider-wrap"><DIV><DIV class="mbr-slider slide carousel" data-pause="true" data-keyboard="false" data-ride="carousel" data-interval="4000"><A data-app-prevent-settings="" class="carousel-control carousel-control-prev" role="button" data-slide="prev" href="#slider2-5g"><SPAN class="sr-only">Previous</SPAN></A><A data-app-prevent-settings="" class="carousel-control carousel-control-next" role="button" data-slide="next" href="#slider2-5g"><SPAN class="sr-only">Next</SPAN></A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="mbr-section article content1 cid-r6dpRxrTyj" id="content1-5h"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="media-container-row"><DIV class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-5">Opentrons</DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="mbr-section article content1 cid-r6vEQcJVHZ" id="content1-gp"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="media-container-row"><DIV class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Opentrons gave us a unit of their OT-2 pipetting robot to help us automate lab protocols and help them gather feedback for future releases.

Our relationship proved invaluable in the beginning of our time with the robot - we ended up on a Skype call with an Opentrons representative to help diagnose a protocol-breaking issue we were having with the robot. Additionally, we joined an exclusive Opentrons forum dedicated to feedback between other iGEM teams with Opentrons products - even making a few technical posts. On top of it all, we automated part of an Interlab protocol using the OT-2 robot and open-sourced every protocol we wrote to GitHub.</DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="carousel slide cid-r6qoKu9bc7" data-interval="false" id="slider2-7x"><DIV class="container content-slider"><DIV class="content-slider-wrap"><DIV><DIV class="mbr-slider slide carousel" data-pause="true" data-keyboard="false" data-ride="carousel" data-interval="4000"><A data-app-prevent-settings="" class="carousel-control carousel-control-prev" role="button" data-slide="prev" href="#slider2-7x"><SPAN class="sr-only">Previous</SPAN></A><A data-app-prevent-settings="" class="carousel-control carousel-control-next" role="button" data-slide="next" href="#slider2-7x"><SPAN class="sr-only">Next</SPAN></A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="mbr-section article content1 cid-r6d8EcNl8p" id="content1-3r"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="media-container-row"><DIV class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-5">Cyanobacteria Protocol Exchange with NU Kazakhstan iGEM</DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="mbr-section article content1 cid-r6vERb736N" id="content1-gq"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="media-container-row"><DIV class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">We had a brief Skype call with NU Kazakhstan discussing our projects as we were both working with <I> S. elongatus </I>.
