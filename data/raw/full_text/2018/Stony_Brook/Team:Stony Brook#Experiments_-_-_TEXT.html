Workflow
Go with the flow.
Growth Experiments
After receiving our cyanobacteria cultures from Dr. Jackie Collier, we wanted to determine the optimal conditions for growth. First, we wanted to determine doubling time and growth rate at room temperature without a shaking incubator. We first made two replicates of a 1% solution of cyanobacteria (49 mL of BG-11 media and 0.5 mL of culture). In order to determine the density of the cultures, we utilized a spectrophotometer and measured the optimal density at 750 nm. We conducted measurements 3 times a day, spaced around 8 hours apart for 5 weeks. We used 750 nm to measure cell density because that wavelength does not conflict with that of the photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll.
Sodium bicarbonate experiments
For the second growth experiment, we wanted to determine the optimum amount of sodium bicarbonate to add to our cyanobacteria. The sodium bicarbonate acted as a buffer for the solution and as another source of carbon for the cells. First, we made a 1M filtered solution of sodium bicarbonate by adding 3.36 g of sodium bicarbonate powder to 40 ml of autoclaved Milli-Q®️ water and running the solution through a filter to filter sterilize the solution. We set up two sets of four flasks with a starting amount of 2% cyanobacteria (1 mL of culture in 49 mL of BG-11 media) for growth room temperature and 33 °C. The four different concentrations were 0 mM sodium bicarbonate, 5 mM sodium bicarbonate (250 µL of sodium bicarbonate solution) , 10 mM sodium bicarbonate (500 µL of sodium bicarbonate solution) and 20 mM sodium bicarbonate (1000 µL of sodium bicarbonate solution). We left one set of cultures at room temperature and grew the other set in a shaking incubator at 33 °C and 100 rpm. We conducted daily spectrophotometer readings for almost 200 hours. 
Constructs/Plasmids
Plasmids were ordered from Addgene and arrived as agar stabs which we replated using a quadrant method. After overnight culture, we inoculated colonies from each plasmid in liquid Luria-Bertani (LB) media. After another overnight culture, we mini prepped using the PureYield™ Plasmid Miniprep System to isolate the plasmid DNA for use in NEBuilder®️ HiFi DNA Assembly with the constructs. 
Constructs were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT) and their respective primers were ordered from Eurofins Scientific and they arrived in dry form in screw cap tubes. They then were resuspended with the appropriate amount of autoclaved Milli-Q®️ water based on the number of moles/weight of DNA shipped. Each construct was amplified via 50 µL PCR reaction. Reactions were set up as according to table 1. 
All PCR reactions were done using the touchdown method, with an initial annealing temperature of 72 °C and gradually lowered to the calculated annealing temperature of the template DNA, usually in the mid to low sixties. Extension times were calculated based on template DNA length. The shortest fragments had calculated extension times of 3 seconds, which was inadequate. Thus, this was modified and we set the extension times for those fragments to 10 seconds. For some constructs the actual annealing temperature was set 3-4 °C lower than the calculated annealing temperature.
PCR cleanup was performed with the Monarch® PCR and DNA Cleanup Kit. We eluted with 10-15 µL of elution buffer or nuclease-free water.
To view DNA bands, we initially used Diamond™ Nucleic Acid Dye from Promega to dye our DNA. Dye solution was prepared by diluting the provided 10000x stock solution with 1x TAE. Gels were soaked in dye solution for around 30 minutes while being gently agitated on a shaker. The dye solution was most effective for a single use and was less effective in subsequent re-uses. When our supply of dye ran out, ethidium bromide was used in the running buffer and gel for visualization of DNA bands.
BioBrick Production
We digested the linearized plasmid backbone pSB1C3 supplied in the iGEM Distribution Kit with an enzyme mastermix (recipe shown in table 2), following iGEM Registry protocols with a few edits. Then, we ligated the digested backbone to purified PCR products of our constructs. We transformed the E. coli with the BioBricks following the iGEM Registry’s single tube transformation protocol and left the plated bacteria in an incubator at 33 °C for overnight. Next, we made liquid inoculations of the bacteria and grew them at 33 °C in a shaking incubator at 250 rpm for 12-14 hours. Afterwards, the vectors containing our Biobricks were isolated from transformed E. coli through miniprep. Successful transformation was confirmed by digesting the mini prepped products with restriction enzymes and running the digest on a gel. Furthermore, we sent in the BioBricks for sequencing for further confirmation of successful transformation. When we received our sequencing results, we isolated the BioBricks by miniprep, placed the solution of DNA on a 96 well microtiter plate and dried it out in a hood for 3 hours and then in an 60 ℃ incubator for 20 minutes to accelerate drying.
NEBuilder®️ HIFI DNA Assembly
In order to ligate our constructs together, we utilized the NEBuilder®️ HIFI DNA Assembly Cloning Kit from New England Biolabs. Following the protocol, we transformed DH5-alpha E. coli with purified PCR products. We left our plates in a 33 ℃ incubator overnight and the next morning, we made liquid inoculations of several colonies with LB media. These inoculations were grown in a shaking incubator at 33 ℃ and 250 rpm for 12-14 hours. Afterwards, we miniprepped our transformed E. coli to isolate DNA which we then used to transform cyanobacteria.
Cyanobacteria Transformation
The cyanobacteria were transformed using stock cultures of UTEX 2434 Synechococcus leopoliensis (from the UTEX Culture Collection of Algae). This culture is equivalent to Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 . We first conducted two experiments by plating the cyanobacteria on low (2 µg/mL) and high antibacterial concentration (10 µg/mL) of streptomycin and spectinomycin. We concluded that the high antibiotic concentration was more optimal for plating. We then proceeded to perform cyanobacteria transformation with plates made with the high concentration of antibiotics. When single colonies formed, we immediately restreaked a select few colonies onto a new plate (with colony patches greater than or approximate to 1cm2). After one round of re-streaking individual colonies were inoculated in BG-11 media with antibiotics and HEPES buffer. 
Sucrose Assay Experimentation 
In order to test CscB (sucrose permease), we added 150 mM of NaCl to 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 50 mL of BG-11 to induce sugar production. S. elongatus PCC 7942 naturally produces sucrose to balance out the osmotic pressure caused by the extracellular salt. Additionally, we added 2 g/L of pH 8.0 HEPES buffer to prevent acidification of the media (as cscB depends on a basic environment to function). We also induced with 1 mM of IPTG after the cells had reached the mid-log phase.
The Sucrose/D-glucose Assay Kit was donated to us by Megazyme and was tested on the cyanobacteria after 1 week and then 2 weeks of IPTG induction. The cyanobacteria were spinned down at 10,000 g for ~5-10 minutes until a pellet formed, and 200 µL of their supernatant was extracted for the assay.
With the assay, the sample was mixed with both acetate buffer (negative control) and fructosidase. After incubating at 50 ℃ for 20 minutes, we added the GOPOD dye, which turns a bright pink (510 nm) when exposed to glucose. After incubating for the required time, we ran triplicates in a spectrophotometer and calculated glucose values with the calculator on Megazyme’s website.
We tested all of our samples against glucose and starch controls (0.25g/L of flour), as well as uninduced samples of cyanobacteria (which lacked NaCl and/or IPTG).
After the obtaining results, we measured the pH because CscB will not secrete sucrose in acidic conditions. Before even testing for sucrose, we noticed that the wild type culture (without antibiotics) had gotten visibly contaminated by fungus (figure 2). As such, we suspect contamination to be the major cause of our lack of results.
Figure 1 : Wild Type induced with NaCl and possibly contaminated with mold 
Figure 2: Cyanobacterial culture contaminated by unknown species of fungus
Then, we started a new round of testing, with and without added antibiotics. We conducted the sucrose assay as before, except the cultures with antibiotics were supplied with 10 µL spectinomycin and 10 µL streptomycin. The cultures we measured sucrose for are:
#1 = cscB #3 150 mM NaCl 1 mM IPTG 10 uM Spec 10 uM Strep 25 ℃
#2 = cscB #2 150 mM NaCl 1 mM IPTG 10 uM Spec 10 uM Strep 25 ℃
#3 = cscB #2 0 mM NaCl 1 mM IPTG 33 ℃
#4 = cscB #2 150 mM NaCl 1 mM IPTG 33 ℃
#5 = cscB #2 150 mM NaCl 33 ℃
#6 = cscB #4 #1 150 mM NaCl 1 mM IPTG 10 uM Spec 10 uM Strep 33 ℃
#7 = cscB #4 150 mM NaCl 1 mM IPTG 10 uM Spec 10 uM Strep 33 ℃
#8 = cscB #2 150 mM NaCl 1 mM IPTG 10 uM Spec 10 uM Strep 33 ℃
#9 = cscB #4  #2 150 mM NaCl 1 mM IPTG 33 ℃
Luciferase Promoters
In order to test the expression of our promoters, cpc, cpc560, idiA, psbA2, (which were incorporated into Dr. Susan Golden’s vector pAM1414 using Gibson assembly), we conducted luciferase experiments. Following Dr. Golden’s procedure, we added 5 µL of decanal to 95 µL of cyanobacteria in each well to induce expression. The decanal acted as a substrate for the bacterial luciferase enzyme, but due to the toxicity, the cells ended up dying, so the data obtained represents the end static expression. For the standard expression experiments for nighttime and daytime, we plated 95 µL of cyanobacteria into a 96 well plate, added 5 µL of decanal, parafilmed the edges and left the plate for 15 minutes before measuring the luminescence in a plate reader. For the high light experiment to psbA2 promoter, we plated 95 µL of cyanobacteria to half of the wells and put them under at least 500 µE of high light in our incubator for 1 hour. Then, we added 95 µL of cyanobacteria not exposed to high light to the other half of the wells and added 5 µL of decanal to all of the wells. Then, we placed the well plate in a plate reader and measured the luminescence. For the iron repressible experiment to idiA promoter, we plated 95 µL of cyanobacteria to half of the wells and exposed them to 2.3 mM of 2,2 dipyridyl (iron chelating agent) for one hour. Then, we added 95 µL of cyanobacteria not exposed to then iron chelating agent to the other half of the wells and added 5 µL of decanal to all of the wells. We placed the well plate in a plate reader and measured the luminescence.
