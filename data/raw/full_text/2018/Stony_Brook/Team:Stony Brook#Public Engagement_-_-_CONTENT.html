Through this activity, children learned about transformation and the fundamental basis of synthetic biology through an interactive means. The main goal of synthetic biology is taking DNA with genes of interest and inserting them into microorganisms such as <I>E. coli</I>, so that they can produce the proteins that the genes code for. Before the activity, we attached velcro to the <I>E. coli</I> we received from Giant Microbes, as well as to cardstock. This would stand as a base for the proteins that the kids would make. At the start of the activity, we explained to the kids the structure of DNA, namely that it is double stranded and has a double helix. Then, we asked them to pick two different colored strings which they twisted together to form the helix. Then, this string was tied to the <I>E. coli</I> in a ring to represent transforming the organism with a recombinant plasmid. Next, we explained that the DNA encodes for proteins. The kids were able to design the proteins that their DNA coded for using pom poms, glitter, googly eyes, pipe cleaners, and beads onto the base we precut for them. In the process of this activity, the kids were able to see how synthetic biology actually works and imitate what scientists do. We were successful in educating while entertaining, ultimately allowing us to create other activities. To help future iGEM teams make activities like this, we have made our activity video publically available on YouTube in addition to posting it on our wiki. One key feature of the video is that it is searchable by a number of tags, and that our team has added closed captions allowing for greater accessibility.

Our iGEM Team built upon this to create a expanded gene circuit activity in which students would be able to create their own tools to make a genetic circuit, stressing key features in science, such as creativity and problem solving. First, this activity was precluded with a presentation on iGEM and basic concepts of synthetic biology. Then, students were able to think of promoters and genes that they would want connected together to solve issues in the world, which they would then restriction enzyme digest and ligate together. This tied together their creativity and the information they learned from the presentation. For example, one of the students created a biosensor for bicarbonate in the oceans to determine areas with increasing acidification. We also have made available on our wiki a PowerPoint® presentation of this activity that we used at one of the schools. We hope that other teams can utilize this activity to learn from the students as we did!

Both our team and Queen’s University iGEM team considered incorporating directed evolution into our corresponding projects. Upon doing some research into directed evolution, we found a lack of resources regarding this topic online and thus, we sought to ameliorate this issue. Both teams collaborated to make create a pamphlet that provides detailed information regarding the methods by which directed evolution can be performed while taking into consideration the advantages and disadvantages of the methods discussed. In addition, the accompanying video about directed evolution present much of the same information as discussed in the pamphlet but does so in a more concise way. We hope that this resource is beneficial for future iGEM teams and other researchers interested in performing directed evolution in their labs. Through this collaboration we expanded our knowledge of synthetic biology and we learned how to collaborate with other student scientists within the community in a meaningful way.

In addition to spreading the knowledge of iGEM, we discussed how important it is to engage in research, and explained how one could start obtaining research experience at an early age. As a reminder of how molecular biology is fun and exciting, we gave the students temporary DNA tattoos. The teachers at WT Clarke High School enjoyed our visit and asked us to come back to present to first-year students. We gifted the faculty with the forum activity from Building with Biology called “Should we genetically engineer mosquitos?” to bring further interest about the ethical considerations of synthetic biology.

We presented to two groups of children. With the first group of children, we gave a presentation about biology as well as synthetic biology and led the students in an activity in which they extracted DNA from strawberries. They were able to isolate and visualize the DNA from a mixture of strawberry fruit clumps, dish soap, salt, and rubbing alcohol. The children learned to transfer the DNA into a microcentrifuge tube using a micropipette. Finally, we helped them attach a string to the microcentrifuge tubes and allowed them to take their extracted strawberry DNA home as a necklace or bracelet. They were ecstatic with the activity and asked us many questions regarding DNA and our project. With the second group of students, we gave the same presentation, but the students took part in the <I>E. coli</I> buddies activity, allowing them to interactively learn what synthetic biologists do. We feel that it is important for an interest in science and sense of curiosity in children to be fostered at a young, and by reaching out to such a young group of students, we were able to introduce the basics of biology to them in a fun and engaging way. By performing strawberry DNA extraction with the kids and allowing them to store and keep the extracted DNA in a creative way, the basic knowledge about the origin or appearance of extracted DNA will be firmly grasped. Furthermore, we learned that young students love asking insightful questions during presentations, and we made sure to accommodate with a longer Q&amp;A session in future presentations.</DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="mbr-section content5 cid-r6dKdfdTMo mbr-parallax-background" id="content5-79"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="media-container-row"><DIV class="title col-12 col-md-8"><H2 class="align-center mbr-bold mbr-white pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-2" id="LaValle">LaValle Movie Night</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="carousel slide cid-r5fd8zwfrp" data-interval="false" id="slider2-2w"><DIV class="container content-slider"><DIV class="content-slider-wrap"><DIV><DIV class="mbr-slider slide carousel" data-pause="true" data-keyboard="false" data-ride="carousel" data-interval="4000"><A data-app-prevent-settings="" class="carousel-control carousel-control-prev" role="button" data-slide="prev" href="#slider2-2w"><SPAN class="sr-only">Previous</SPAN></A><A data-app-prevent-settings="" class="carousel-control carousel-control-next" role="button" data-slide="next" href="#slider2-2w"><SPAN class="sr-only">Next</SPAN></A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="mbr-section article content1 cid-r6vM8244Nj" id="content1-i5"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="media-container-row"><DIV class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">To increase awareness of synthetic biology, we held a booth at the LaValle Movie Night, where parents and children from Suffolk County came to our University's football field to watch the animated movie Sing. To engage the children before the movie, we gave out pompoms and explained the basic principles of biology and what molecular biology means. For older audiences, we handed out flyers explaining our project and spoke with parents and members of the community about what synthetic biology entails. Parents shared their personal concerns with GMO’s and synthetic biology in many aspects of day to day life. We were able to ease their worries by explaining the benefits and applications of synthetic biology. Young children were also able to grasp the advantage of our project in helping the environment. We approached reaching the general community by attending this event and speaking with parents and children. Our pom-pom activity and flyers were both informational as well as engaging. We learned that the best way to educate young children is with hands-on activities and props. Nonetheless, many were very interested to see what we were doing and teaching! This was a fun event for the community and for the iGEM team as well.

Girls Inc. is an organization that focuses on empowering young girls with research-based activities and other programs. Our visit to Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), where the Girls Inc. event was held, was both stimulating for the girls and for our team. We started our visit by observing a panel of executives from companies and corporations, such as National Grid, providing insight and advice on how to succeed. Next, we presented about iGEM, our project, synthetic biology, and even gave a “crash course” on basic biology terminology. The girls were captivated and asked us questions about our research experience and advice on what classes they should take. To further captivate the girls, five team members created a game to crystallize the concepts of genes and promoters, a major aspect of synthetic biology. In order to solve a real-world problem, the girls were asked to create theoretical gene circuits with promoters, genes and restriction enzymes. The girls were creative in producing their gene circuits. For example, one girl came up with a sensor that would detect high acidity and would show bioluminescence in the presence of pollution and other girls tried to tackle diseases such as Alzheimer's and diabetes. Then, they were given two different colored string to represent the DNA that they twisted and tied together to create plasmid DNA. Our approach to educating a higher educational level of students was a success as we were invited back to present to BNL. We, as a team, believe that we learned to question more real-life situations stemming from the curiosity of the girls. </DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="mbr-section content5 cid-r6dKh1zFgf mbr-parallax-background" id="content5-7d"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="media-container-row"><DIV class="title col-12 col-md-8"><H2 class="align-center mbr-bold mbr-white pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-2" id="STEP">STEP/BNL Summer of Science</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="carousel slide cid-r5fdcAEa1C" data-interval="false" id="slider2-32"><DIV class="container content-slider"><DIV class="content-slider-wrap"><DIV><DIV class="mbr-slider slide carousel" data-pause="true" data-keyboard="false" data-ride="carousel" data-interval="4000"><A data-app-prevent-settings="" class="carousel-control carousel-control-prev" role="button" data-slide="prev" href="#slider2-32"><SPAN class="sr-only">Previous</SPAN></A><A data-app-prevent-settings="" class="carousel-control carousel-control-next" role="button" data-slide="next" href="#slider2-32"><SPAN class="sr-only">Next</SPAN></A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="mbr-section article content1 cid-r6vM96UtHC" id="content1-i7"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="media-container-row"><DIV class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><DIV>After spending hours perfecting our interactive presentation, we were successful in introducing synthetic biology to students between the grades of 7 and 9.

Ultimately leading to our interactive activity in which the students were able to insert their creative genes into plasmids. Many of these middle schoolers had fascinating questions, and the iGEM team members were able to answer them diligently. After the activity, the students walked away with a complimentary iGEM pen, a plasmid made up of twisted string, a syringe that represented the tools that biologists used, and the basic knowledge of synthetic biology. The pictures we took can not even express how rewarding the students felt with their experience in this interactive event. We approached this event by preparing an interactive and captivating activity in which participants were able to use their creativity and imagination.

In an effort to liven up the program, we built upon activities used by previous iGEM teams at Stony Brook. Many students already had a basic understanding of synthetic biology and were able to ask us insightful questions. They were quite curious about the workings and implications of our project.

We had an amazing time with the children there, showing them the basics of biology with a more visual and interesting method: extracting DNA from strawberries and oranges. To make the activity as hands-on as possible, the children themselves became “scientists” and through dish soap, salt, and rubbing alcohol, were able to visualize clumps of fruit DNA. They then learned how to use a micropipette, and pipetted their DNA solution into microcentrifuge tubes, which they were able to bring home as a necklace or bracelet. We chose this as an activity in order to inspire and introduce younger children to the fields of biology and synthetic biology.

Therefore, our iGEM team decided we should pioneer and educate those in the Deaf community about iGEM and synthetic biology. Three members of our team, one of whom has a background in American Sign Language, ventured to the Islip Middle School, a satellite center of the Cleary Deaf School, packed with activities, posters boards, and presentations. We first gave a presentation on biology, synthetic biology, and our presentation -- translated with the help of an interpreter. We thought hands-on activities would be the best way for the students to get a visual of biology in action. The first activity we presented was DNA extraction with fruit. As soon as the DNA began to clump up, the students (and teachers) were beyond excited. With just this moment, we were touched and were grateful for the opportunity! Next, we introduced the students to pipettes. They pipetted liquids and the DNA from the previous activity into small tubes. These small tubes were then turned into bracelets and necklaces. We fostered small discussion within groups with the help of the interpreters. The students asked insightful questions about many aspects of biology. With just this event, we learned that, just like the Deaf community, there are many groups that are not often reached. Although we may not have been able to reach all these communities, we are beyond happy to have been able to reach the Deaf community and are humbled by our experience.

More specifically, one topic we discussed was how the revenue from producing biofuels could trickle back into funding the research behind these improving these processes. To this extent, her staff was very interested in increasing the sustainability of our project, and so we agreed to send our project poster and full wiki information after the Jamboree, such that they could help reach out to other leaders to help making carbon sinking more of a reality. We reached out to Laura Curran because she is a powerful and respected leader within Nassau County’s local government and we not only wanted her perspective on the importance of funding biofuel research but also we aimed to share our knowledge with an individual who had the ability to make impactful change in the community. The success of this meeting with local members of politics informed us of society’s growing acceptance towards using biofuel in reducing carbon emissions as well as the receptiveness of local politicians towards the concerns of local citizens. While most of our outreach events involve young children, this meeting provided us a chance to engage with political leaders on the topic of synthetic biology and create a dialogue centered around synthetic biology.
