Our Team
Stony Brook iGEM is not only the best iGEM team to have ever existed, but also the best team to have ever existed. We've got people. We've got teamwork. We've got trips to adventureland. We've got trips to Taco Bell. We've got trips to Taco Bell. Take a few moments out of your day to bask in the glorious grid of colors and pictures that is our team. I can't come up with any more filler text. How's it going?
Matthew Mullin
Sophomore
Mechanical Engineering
As the other glorious leader of our team, Matt (aka Elon) always manages to look enitrely cool and composed in front of every and any problem we encounter. This is likely due to his lifelong dream of becoming a pirate, since pirates need perfect composure out on sea. However, the ocean is not the only area Matt would love to explore, he also enjoys the more land based activity of hiking.
*thumbs up* "Cool"
Priya Aggarwal
Sophomore
Human Evolutionary Biology
One of our two lovely team leaders, Priya is always down to go and indulge in her love of Taco Bell. When she is not spending inordinate amounts of time in lab or studying organic chemistry, Priya enjoys roasting other team members (Lin) and watching various anime shows.
"We are massivley f*cked"
Dominika Kwasniak
Junior
Biochemistry
Dominika is the coolest cat of the cool cats (according to Priya). In her free time, she tries to learn to penny board without breaking anything and enjoys arts and crafts. Outside of the lab she works as an RA, attempting to teach freshmen how to adult while struggling to do the same herself.
"SINCE WHEN IS MY NICKNAME OEDIPUS"
Matthew Lee
Sophmore
Biology
Our lab's very own Steph Curry; when not in the lab itself you can find him playing, or talking about, or watching basketball. He claims to lead a simple life which includes working out and playing the Doom Series, though we wouldn't say working out is all that simple.
"Is it weird that the Elmer's Liquid Glue is making me hungry?"
Sara Vincent
Senior
Biology
Although she may look harmless, Sara is not to be underestimated. As the most badass of us all, Sara was always ready to take anyone on in a game of cards. Besides winning those card games, Sara likes to show off her crafty skills through DIY projects and listen to some hip-hop in the meantime.
"You're making me blush <3"
Natalie Lo
Sophomore
Biology
Always smiling, Natalie insists she does nothing but sleep outside of lab. However, through intensive investigation, we have discovered that she also enjoys watching netflix and skillfully folding origami.
"It's stupid"
Woody Sea
Senior
Biochemistry and Psychology
The oldest member on our team, Woody hates being reminded of his age. In whatever spare time he can find, Woody enjoys dancing, playing both video and board games, and crying. The crying is a joke...mostly.
"Look at that perfect suck"
Manvi  Shah
Sophomore
Psychology
The Queen of puns herself, Manvi brightened lab with her MANvelous puns and jokes. With her happy spirit and creative mind she helped design much of our teams logo and other projects. Being apart of the SBU Raaswalas Team, she was always ready to dance and pump the rest of the team up.
*rolling on a lab chair* "Guys, I'm on a roll today"
Robert Ruzic
Senior
Biomedical Engineering
Bringing more life to lab, Rob could be found bopping to a variety of music or ready to try out some face paint on his fellow team members. As the modeling expert for our team, Rob has spent countless hours perfecting his techniques. When not in lab, you can find Rob juggling class work, research, and extracurriculars with ease.
"Two times two times two times two - that's eight"
Jennifer Rakhimov
Sophomore
Biology
We can confidently say Jennifer is the most organized and put together member of our team. Motivated and ready to kick our butts into gear at any time, Jennifer always kept us on task. She always brightens up our days, and our outreach events, by bringing Gosha, her parrot (and our honorary iGEM member). When not in lab, Jennifer is an active athlete on the Rowing Team, a member of the Marching Band Color Guard, and the iGEM Photographer.
"Wiki Wiki Wiki WIKi WIKIIIII"
Karthik Ledalla
Sophomore
Biomedical Engineering
From Litty City itself (population 1), Karthik was always ready for an adventure. Being one of the few driving members on the team, Karthik would join members on food adventures and iGEM adventures. When not in lab, Karthik enjoys beating Matt Lee in basketball and being an active member of the SBU Raaswala team.
"Litty City"
Lin Yu Pan
Junior
Health Science
The lab's dedicated night owl, Lin has spent many a spooky night working away in the lab. While his night's are taken, Lin spends his days baking pies (which none of the lab members have tasted quite yet) as well as cooking Korean food. His talents do not only lie in the kitchen as, on occasion, Lin treats himself to a quaint game of ping pong.
"Do it, you won't"
Stephanie Budhan
Sophomore
Chemistry
Stephanie was always willing to risk her life for iGEM. Whether it be taking a left-turn on red, or parking in staff parking lots, she did it all with the best messy bun any of our lab members have ever seen.
"I'm gonna f*ck you up Karthik"
Lukas Velikov
Sophomore
Computer Science
Lukas is not a man of many words but most definitely a man of many thoughts. When not sharing dad jokes with the rest of the team, you can find Lukas working diligently on the wiki page. As a "foodie", Lukas was always willing to try new foods with the rest of the team!
"Noice" *best said in Lukas' voice*
