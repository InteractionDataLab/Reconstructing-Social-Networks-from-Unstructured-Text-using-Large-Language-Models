Our team is composed of 16 students : 14 Master students in Biology, 1 Bachelor student and 1 PhD student. Sugar, spices, and everything nice, these were the ingredients chosen to create the Sugar[R]evolution team. We have dedicated our lives with Claude to spread the use of microalgae.

Human practices
- Creation of an image representing our bioreactor concept: iGEM Newcastle
Newcastle worked on an initial visual of our photobioreactor.
- Conférence: “What will synthetic biology bring to the Future”: iGEM GO Paris Saclay , IGEM Bordeaux
We worked with iGEM Paris Saclay and iGEM Bordeaux to organize a conference at Sorbonne Université. We all searched for speakers and we have shared the tasks for the implementation of the conference and its diffusion on social media.
- Practical work at Maurice Genevoix high school: Léo Carillo and Léa Meneu ( IGEM Montpellier )
Léo Carillo and Léa Meneu wrote the slides for the presentation during the practical work at High School. They gave their help to succeed this practical work
Experiments
Interlab: iGEM Pasteur
They answered our question during the interlab period. They also gave us advices to succeed the interlab.
Modelling
Modelling of our project: Raphael Guegan et Guillaume Garnier ( iGEM GO Paris Saclay )
We did not have mathematicians in our team. Raphael Guegan and Guillaume Garnier helped us to conceive the modelling part of our project. We brought them the data.

General Support
Our special gratitude goes for to our amazing supervisors Marco Da Costa, Frédérique Péronnet and Pierre Crozet: their help was more than precious from all points of view! They followed us all along this bumpy ride, they supported us, they gave us confidence in ourselves even in the difficult times and cheered with us in the good ones. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you for everything you gave us during this incredible year.
- Pr. Frédérique Peronnet: a specialist in epigenetic and developmental biology. She is a research director at IBPS, UMR7622, Laboratoire de Biologie du Développement Team "Contrôle épigénétique de l'homéostasie et de la plasticité du développement" and Vice-Dean of the Faculty of Science and Engineering of Sorbonne Université.
- Dr. Marco Da Costa: a specialist in cellular biology and regeneration. He is an associate professor at Sorbonne Université and a researcher in the same team than Frédérique Peronnet
- Dr. Pierre Crozet: : a specialist in plant biology, specifically in the molecular mechanisms that allow plants to adapt to stress conditions and developing Algal Synthetic Biology. He is an associate professor at Sorbonne Université and researcher in Molecular and Cellular Biology of Eukaryotes Laboratory in the Team Systems and Synthetic Biology of microalgae.
They are our superheroes, without them the iGEM adventure would have not been possible. To learn more about our awesome instructors visit our team page

Project support and advice
- Sophie Louvet-Vallée: Head of the Molecular and Cellular Biology Master at Sorbonne Université. We really appreciate her unconditional support.
- Stéphanie Graff-Dubois:Head of the Molecular and Cellular Biology Master at Sorbonne Université (starting from September 2018)
Brainstorming
This experts helped us during our brainstorming session. They accepted to answer our questions about the feasibility of our previous projects. They also gave us valuable advice and other ideas of project.
Lyme disease project
- Fréderique Gay:He is involved in the project "Clima-Tique".  He is a doctor of medicine, doctor of sciences in parasitology and ecology. During our interview with Mr. Gay, he proposed different projects related to malaria, the environment, early diagnosis of Alzheimer's with biomarkers. He advised us to contact specialists in research and development as well as in institutions. He also gave us the contact of professionals to help us in our project.
- Benoît Jaulhac:Bacteriologist at the Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital of Strasbourg (National Borrelia center). He explained to us that in the context of this disease, it is not possible to provide a diagnosis due to the fact that the bacteria is hidden in the tissues. It stays in the blood only for a short periode of time. There are too many open questions regarding this disease. In conclusion, the project of Lyme disease could hardly succeed.
Cicasqualane project
- Luc Teot: member in the medical team: "Plaies-cicatrisation, brûlés, chirurgie plastique et reconstruction CHU de Montpellier”  and President of the “société française et francophone des plaies et cicatrisation” (SFFPC)
- Sylvie Meaume: Geriatrics - Wounds and healing at Rothschild Hospital and Vice-president of the “société française et francophone des plaies et cicatrisation” (SFFPC)
During our brainstorming period, we had several interesting projects. You can follow our brainstorming on the brainstorming page

Improve a previous project
As we were making bibliographic researches for our project, we found out that a previous team had a similar project in 2017. It was the D.I.V.E.R.T. project conceived by the BOKU-Vienne team. You can find below a short presentation of their project quoted from their wiki (https://2017.igem.org/Team:BOKU-Vienna)

D.I.V.E.R.T. Directed In Vivo Evolution via Reverse Transcription
Abtract
In vivo continuous directed evolution offers significant advantages over classic in vitro methods as it drastically reduces the amount of time and actual lab work required. Most current approaches, however, are based on globally accelerated mutagenesis inevitably leading to unwanted off-target mutations. D.I.V.E.R.T. represents the concept of a new continuous in vivo evolution strategy that allows full spatial control of mutagenesis by building systems that resemble the retrotransposon life cycle: The gene of interest’s mRNA is reverse transcribed in an error prone way and reintegrated into the genome at the respective locus replacing the original gene for several cycles. To demonstrate the generalizability of the process we plan on carrying out our proof of concept experiment in yeast and E. coli. By the end of August we are still in the cloning stage. Additionally, we are working on a single plasmid system for CRISPR-enhanced chromosomal integration in E. coli.
https://2017.igem.org/Team:BOKU-Vienna
To spread the use of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as green cell factory, we enriched the recently published Modular Cloning (Moclo) toolkit with a synthetic retrotransposon to generate in vivo continuous directed evolution. Directed evolution aims to identify beneficial mutations on a gene or a biosynthetic pathway.
