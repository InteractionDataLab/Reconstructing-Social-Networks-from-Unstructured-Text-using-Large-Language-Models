Sponsors
Thank to our sponsors, we were able to pursue our experiments and create communication platforms for our project. They also enabled us to take part in events such as the Sustainability festival (festival du développement durable), organised by the LUPA organisation, Les Universitaires Planteurs d’Alternatives (Academics planters of alternatives). They also allowed us to hold a stand at the 2018 Science Village of Sorbonne Université which will take place from October 12th to October 14th.
Last but not least they enabled us to join the iGEM competition and the Giant Jamboree in Boston by donating money for our tuition fees and travel expenses!

Master BMC
Molecular and Cellular Biology Master at Sorbonne Université (Master BMC)
TThe department of Molecular and Cellular Biology at Sorbonne Université was among the first entities to support our project. Many of our team members are currently enrolled in this Master Program.  Its main objective is to provide its students high levels of education. In this Master students can specialize in a large variety of disciplines in biology: biochemistry, molecular, cellular or developmental biology, genetics, immunology, microbiology, bioinformatics and biophysics. In addition, students acquire many skills such as managing bibliographic resources, knowing how to set up an experiment, making critical analysis of scientific results as well as cross-disciplinary skills such as knowing how to work in a group, carrying out a project and communicating results. Those were very helpful to our team throughout the iGEM competition.

UFR de Sciences de la Vie de Sorbonne Université
Education and Research Unit for Life Sciences at Sorbonne Université
The Education and Research Unit for Life Sciences at Sorbonne University (UFR 927) gathers three departments: the Bachelor degree of Life Sciences, the Master degree of Molecular and Cellular Biology Master, and the Master degree of Integrative Biology and Physiology. It is a multidisciplinary unit that covers all fields of biology. Besides being an important platform for theoretical and practical education that welcomes around 3700 students each year, its research activities are being carried out in 15 institutes. Moreover, 6 research centers and 6 PhD programs are also affiliated to the UFR 927. This year our project SugaRevolution was selected for the BQR (Bonus Quality Research) Prize offered by the UFR 927. The BQR which was created by the Ministry of Higher Education and Research of France in 1990 allows Education and Research Units to support and promote research projects carried out within their laboratories. We are very proud of this distinction.
