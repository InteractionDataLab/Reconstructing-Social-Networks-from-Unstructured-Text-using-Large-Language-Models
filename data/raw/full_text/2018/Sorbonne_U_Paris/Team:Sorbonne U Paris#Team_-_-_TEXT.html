Our team
We are the Sorbonne U Paris iGEM team. Our team is composed of 16 students: 14 Master's students in Biology, 1 undergraduate student, 1 PhD student and one microalgae Claude. Sugar, spices, and everything nice, these were the ingredients chosen to create the Sugar[R]evolution team.  This is our third year participating in the iGEM competition, and we look forward to continuing for years to come! Meet the Suga[R]evolution team after clicking on the pictures.

iGEM at Sorbonne Université
Sorbonne University was born on January 1, 2018, from the merger of the Paris-Sorbonne and Pierre and Marie Curie universities. The purpose of pooling the strengths of these two institutions is to lead and train future players in world-class research, presenting the full range of disciplines in the fields of literature, the arts, the humanities and social sciences, the sciences, engineering and medicine.
As Sorbonne University students, we are proud to bring to the international scene of synthetic biology the values of scientific excellence and openness to the world of our university already rich in history.
The first iGEM UPMC-Paris team was created in 2016 at the initiative of students in the Master of Molecular and Cellular Biology who recognized themselves in the values of iGEM and allowed the creation of a second team in 2017 Both teams were able to lead with determination their projects "Bee subtilis" and “The BioMaker Factory” rewarded by a Bronze Medal.
We have set up a tutoring system between the previous teams and this year's team, which allows us to exchange and benefit from their experience of the competition, which with the help of our teachers gives us every chance to win the competition. highest award of the contest.
