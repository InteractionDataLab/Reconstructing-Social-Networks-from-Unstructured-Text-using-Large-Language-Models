Improving our 3-HP(3-Hydroxypropionic Acid) Biosensor
Project Description
Many industrial manufacturing processes revolve around the molecule 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP). This         organic molecule can be used in a variety of industrial products, from biofuels to bioplastic production. As a         biologically produced chemical, 3HP is biodegradable and thus a better substitute for inorganic plastics for         environmental reasons. As 3HP-derived plastics degrade, they release carbon dioxide, but do not persist for         thousands of years in landfills (as PET plastics do). While much of the field is focusing on maximizing the         production of this important molecule, a much smaller subset is focused on finding ways to sense and measure         its production in an effort to aid industrial manufacturing systems. In a recent study, genes from the         bacteria Pseudomonas putida were incorporated into Escherichia coli and Cupriavidus         necator and demonstrated that re-purposed regulatory proteins from P. putida could be used as a         biosensor for 3HP (Hanko et al. 2017). A separate study identified similar 3HP responsive genes in Pseudomonas denitrificans (Zhou et al. 2015).
Our summer iGEM research project seeks to use the same 3HP responsive genes found in P. putida and P. denitrificans as switches for a reporter. This system will program our bacteria to express         luciferase in response to the presence of 3HP. Additionally, we are seeking to add this system to Bacillus subtilis, a hardy bacterium that has great potential as a 3HP producer for industrial processes         and metabolic engineering experiments. B. subtilis can withstand high concentrations of 3HP without         triggering toxicity pathways. By modifying naturally occurring proteins with 3HP sensitive genes in new         organisms, we can tune our biosensor to be used for different purposes in research and industry. This         collection of 3HP responsive biological tools can also be used by future iGEM teams around the world, as we         will package our system in biological packets known as Biobricks. Similar to Lego pieces snapping together,         Biobricks can be easily incorporated into bacteria by other iGEM teams to build larger projects with an         amalgam of these biological building blocks.
What makes our project impressive is its potential impact on the industrialization of environmentally friendly plastic alternatives.  Talking with Lanzatech, a biotech start-up company in Illinois, a biosensing system that reports within six hours would be a desirable industrial tool.  They mentioned that 3HP is one of the chemicals that they are investigating, because of rising mode of production in industrial processes for bioplastics.
We had to apply some creative problem solving to imagine how we could incorporate our biosensor into a chassis that would be hardy enough to carry out its intended function as well as work in tandem with other biologically engineered systems.  Being inspired by the accomplishment of other iGEM teams, we rearranged our preconceptions of how our device should function and put the device back together in multiple iterations to test the interactions between alternate ORIs and promoters and regulators across different biological systems.  In this way we embraced the principles of iGEM and synthetic biology by demonstrating the interchangeability of our biobricks. And thus we were able to optimize our biosensor’s performance and reduce its induction time.
