Community Expert iGEM Contributors
Brendan Owens & Integrated DNA Technologies:
We want to thank IDT for providing us with primers and M-blocks for our regulators & promoters.             We want to give a special shoutout to Brendan Owens who took us on a personal tour of IDT and their synthetic biology facility in Coralville, IA.
Opentrons:
We want to thank Opentrons for awarding our team with the OT2 pipetting robot and providing general support for installation and implementation. We cleverly named our bot, "Opentrons Prime"!
Boas Pucker:
We want to thank our iGEM mentor, Boas Pucker. He has been a huge help in aiding us with troubleshooting, staying on top of deadlines and general support.
Jacob Beal:
We would like to thank Dr. Jacob Beal. Dr. Beal spoke with our team about standardization in measurement and provided some tips on how to manage communication among multiple labs as an iGEM team.
2017 iGEM Team
Shahaed Hasan
We would like to thank Shahead Hasan for being our student mentor. Shahead provided insight into the 2017 iGEM project and helped us dig into some of the scientific papers relevant to our project.
Mason Lamarche
We would like to thank former 2017 UIOWA iGEM member, Mason, for interviewing our group for a 23andMe article.
Nicholas (Niko) McCarty
We would like to thank the founder of the UIOWA iGEM team. Niko met with us, brought us coffee and             bagels and provided some scientific background and insight into current news and advances in synthetic biology.

Teacher's Assistant: Tanner Reeb
We would like to thank our teaching assistant for the Synthetic Biology class. He ensured all the reagents for class were prepared and available. He also attended meetings and provided some insight and assistance with data analysis and interpretation.
Students: all
The course objective aims to establish standardized lab practices for the 2018 iGEM team using the iGEM protocols and invited interested University students to participate in an abridged iGEM experience. The course exposure included recreating the 2017 interlab and working with actual iGEM Biobricks to demonstrate applied principles of synthetic biology.
The Voayers of Plasmo, Molecular Defender-
Animated story to bridge the gap between STEM student outreach and fans of sci-fi/COMICON. We wanted to bridge the gap between outreach attempts to students who self-identify as STEM tracked and fans of sci-fi/COMICON aka: future world citizens who would be favorably disposed and have a potential aptitude for STEM concepts.

Jorge Moreno
We would like to thank our student mentor, Jorge Moreno. Jorge went above and beyond attending meetings and mentoring our Outreach and Human Practices group. Good luck at Princeton!
Human Practices
Meeting with Dr. Anya Prince
Dr. Prince currently serves as University of Iowa professor and attorney who specializes in the ethics of genetics and biotechnology. We would like to thank her for taking the time to sit down and discuss with us possible issues with working in synthetic biology.
