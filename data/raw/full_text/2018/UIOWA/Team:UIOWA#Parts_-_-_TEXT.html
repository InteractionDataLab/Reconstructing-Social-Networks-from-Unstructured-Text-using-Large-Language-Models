Parts Overview
BBa_K2712000
3-HP Inducible Promoter (PmmsA)
This is a promoter that was selected for use in Bacillus subtilis. It originates from Pseudomonas denitrificans. This promoter is regulated by the Lys-family regulator protein encoded by the mmsR biobrick and is intended for use as a biosensor for 3-hydroxypropionic acid. Registry Page
BBa_K2712001
3-HP Inducible Regulator (MmsR)
This is a Bacillus subtilis optimized regulator that belongs to the Lys-family of transcriptional regulators and it is inducible by 3-hydroxypropionic acid. It originated from Pseudomonas denitrificans. Its intended use is in conjunction with PmmsA promoter as a biosensor for 3-HP. This promoter can be found in the BBa_K2712000 biobrick. Registry Page
BBa_K2712002
3-HP Inducible Promoter (PhpdH)
This is a promoter that selected for use in Bacillus subtilis. It is regulated the complex formed between 3-hydroxypropionic acid and the Lys-family transcriptional regulator encoded by HpdR. It is intended for use as a 3-HP biosensor. Registry Page
Figure 1: Optical density of 3-HP inducible biobricks with varying concentrations             over an six hour period in xylose. The 3-HP inducible biobricks are the             Promoter PmmsA, Regulator MmsR, and Promoter PhpdH. The last column displays the negative             control to verify no contamination was present within the             wells throughout the experiment.
Figure 2: Molecular weight of 3-HP inducible biobricks analyzed through gel electrophoresis as part of the gel extraction.             The 3-HP inducible biobricks Promoter PmmsA and Promoter PhpdH have molecular weights of 220 bp while Regulator MmsR have molecular weight of 860 bp.             The caculation of molecular weights were interpolated through the 20-log ladder.
