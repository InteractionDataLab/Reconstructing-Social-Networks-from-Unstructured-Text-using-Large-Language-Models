</H1><DIV class="collapsible_accordion"><H1> Discussion with Professor Anya Prince on the Ethics of Genetic Manipulation and Engineering
        </H1><DIV class="collapsible_accordion_content hide_content"><DIV class="deadline_content"><P>
                With a competition in which the goal is to genetically manipulate a system, our team decided to sit down with
                Anya Prince, a University of Iowa professor and lawyer focusing on the ethics and legal standpoint on genetic
                testing. Professor Prince came fully prepared to have an open discussion on what the implications of our project
                may entail. She brought articles and statements from other outside sources on their views of the iGEM competition.
            </P><P>
                A frequent topic of discussion was the idea of Dual-Use. This is the idea that some physical thing can have
                more than one use. Take this drastic example; you want to study some nasty, highly virulent disease in hopes
                to find a cure. But in doing the research and publishing your results, you run the risk of someone out there
                deciding to read your papers in the malicious intent of weaponizing such a disease. Do you take the risk that
                someone out there might use your results for bad purposes? What if said disease had a high fatality rate, would
                you endanger the other people in your lab in hopes of furthering knowledge on this disease?
            </P><P>
                Our team wasn’t particularly concerned as our project revolves around a low hazard chemical and bacterium,
                but it was interesting to think of all the arguments for and against genetic engineering and manipulation.
                The common agreement was as long as genetic engineering is not used for the “wrong” purposes and instead used
                to benefit health, it is morally ethical.
            </P><P>
                Along the lines of ethics of a growing topic in science, we briefly covered what regulations and rules are imposed
                on science.The government has say over what can and can not be done in publicly owned labs. These include University
                labs and military. The interesting fact was that privately owned labs may not have to follow these same regulations.
                Another controversial topic was brought up; embryos. While there are governmental laws protecting embryos from experiments
                including gene editing, what’s to stop a private company from doing such a thing? And what if studying embryos for
                the purpose of curing hereditary diseases via gene editing is beneficial? Where does the government draw their boundary
                line between what should and should not be researched?
            </P><P>
                Overall, the team had a great conversation with Professor Prince. We learned a lot about
                regulations and what consequences our project could bring about. Luckily biodegradable plastic and
                a biosensor for biodegradable plastic can’t really be used in malicious ways!

            </P><P>
                At iGEM we believe societal considerations should be upfront and integrated throughout the design and execution
                of synthetic biology projects. “Human Practices” refers to iGEM teams’ efforts to actively consider how the world
                affects their work and the work affects the world. Through your Human Practices activities, your team should
                demonstrate how you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your project is responsible and good for
                the world. We invite you to explore issues relating (but not limited) to the ethics, safety, security, and
                sustainability of your project, and to show how this exploration feeds back into your project purpose, design
                and execution.

                </H1><DIV class="collapsible_accordion_content hide_content"><DIV class="deadline_content"><P>
                        Jennifer Farrell, Delaney Soule, Sean Ryan and our mentor Dr. Sander had the pleasure
                        of video chatting with Dr. Michael Koepke, the LanzaTech Team Leader for Synthetic Biology.
                        LanzaTech is a chemical biotech company that uses industrial pollutants as a carbon source
                        for their synthetically bioengineered fuel producing microbes.
                    </P><P>
                        During our call, we discussed the process LanzaTech uses when engineering metabolic pathways 
                        and what conditions our biosensor would have to operate under for it to be useful in their 
                        industrial process. Dr. Koepke’s primary concerns were the ability of our reporter to work 
                        under anaerobic conditions,
                        a fast induction time, and the ability of the device to work in <I>Clostridium autoethanogenum</I>.
                    </P><P>
                        When considering the viability of our device in anaerobic conditions, we understood that
                        most fluorescent proteins would not be a viable option because their chromophore require
                        diatomic oxygen to active color expression. We also know that luciferase reporter we are
                        using may face this challenge as well. To solve this, we discussed replacing the luciferase
                        reporter with an anaerobic fluorescent protein such as phiLOV from pRPF185
                        (Buckley et al. 2016). Unfortunately, this does not exist as an iGEM BioBrick at this
                        time and our lab is not equipped to work on bacteria in anaerobic conditions, making
                        it difficult for us to adequately test the performance of such a construct in its intended
                        chassis.
                    </P><P>
                        However, we have been able to demonstrate the viability of our device upstream from the
                        reporter. Our device currently shows a luminescent signal around 6 hours after the introduction
                        of 3-HP and xylose. This would be an improvement upon the LanzaTech screening time of about 12
                        hours. This would help tremendously in the screening of strains during the initial phases of
                        testing.
                    </P><P>
                        With all this in mind, we feel that the future of our system would be the creation of
                        a <I>Clostridium autoethanogenum</I> codon optimized phiLOV protein introduced into our
                        device in place of our current luciferase reporter. With this change, we could develop
                        new biobricks and expand the current iGEM library into more diverse organisms with current
                        industrial applications.
