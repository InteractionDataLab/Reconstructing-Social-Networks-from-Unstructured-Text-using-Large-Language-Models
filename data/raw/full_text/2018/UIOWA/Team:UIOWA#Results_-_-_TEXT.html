Results
Luminescence (RLU)/OD600 by timepoint
Peak Luminescence (RLU)/OD600
Raw Luminosity Data (RLU)
Raw Luminosity Data by device in 3-HP
Propionic Acid (RLU)/OD600 by timepoint
Propionic Acid (RLU)/OD600
Discussion/Analysis:
Induction occurred at the sixth hours proportionate to varying concentrations of 3-HP
Concentrations of 3-HP examined during induction:
1.25 mM
2.50 mM
5.00 mM.
Non-specific induction method utilized propionic acid metabolites
Conclusion: the induction was not as expected due to lumonisty being present within the promoter construct rather than the whole 3-HP.
Future Directions:
Is there LysR protein assistance coming from our chassis?
What is the underlying biological cause of the peak and drop in luminosity?
