We worked very hard to improve the 2017 part.  We transformed it into E. coli and confirmed through a pcr and a restriction digest that the transformation was successful.  However we were not able to achieve successful induction of our LUX reporter using 3-HP.  We turned our time and attention to working with an industrially desitrable chassis, Clostridium autoethanogenum. As part of our Human Practices collaboration, we have made progress codon optimizing our regulator for Clostridium and discovered an appropriate reporter for anaerobic conditions to be attached to.  As this will expand the diversity of the iGEM parts bank, we propose that work on this innovation will continue.
