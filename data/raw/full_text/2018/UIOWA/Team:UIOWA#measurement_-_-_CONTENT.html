The results demonstrated the potential for reprodicibility and standardization of protocols.  In addition to replicating our interlab work, we also wrote a more intricate program for the OT-2 to perform our device testing.  We used the robot to prepare our dilutions, and dispense our chemicals and our samples into 96-well plates.  By implementing this structure over testing our biobrick devices, we were able to achieve true replicate testing, and ensure accuracy and consistency of all paradigms being tested.  We maintained confidence that the samples and concentrations reflected in our data were accurate representations of our planned experiments.  We eliminated the outliers of hand pipetted plates where single wells might have missed application of a single reagent or sample.
