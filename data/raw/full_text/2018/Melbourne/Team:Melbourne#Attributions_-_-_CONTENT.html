We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.</P><P>
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.</P></DIV><DIV class="column third_size"><DIV class="highlight decoration_B_full"><H3> Can we base our project on a previous one? </H3><P>Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, <B>as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.</B></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
