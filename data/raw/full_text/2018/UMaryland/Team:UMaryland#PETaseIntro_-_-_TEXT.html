History
Past iGEM Teams involved with PET
Listed here are past iGEM teams that have worked on projects on or related to PET degredation.
2012
BAU-Indonesia
Isolation of cutinase gene from nature with primers
TU Darmstadt
Surface display of cutinase on E. coli
Attempted TPA transport into E. coli, further research required
Expressed all TPH enzymes, did not attempt to measure activity
Confirmed anaerobic conversion of PCA via AroY and  XylE enzymes
UC Davis
Confirmed cutinase activity using PNPB esterase assay
Engineered E. coli ethylene glycol metabolism with directed evolution
2013
Imperial College
Produced P3HB bioplastic from mixed waste containing at least some PET
2014
METU Turkey
Reduced catechol to pyruvate
ITB Indonesia
LC cutinatse activity confimed with SEM, PNPB
2015
Pasteur Paris
PNPB assay to confirm activity of esterase EST13
Fluorescent detection of TPA can not be accomplished when in LB broth
2016
ASIJ Tokyo
Attempt at detecting PET degradation by mass change failed
AUC Turkey
Withdrawn
Baltimore BioCrew
Planned to weigh PET degradation, no results
BGU Israel
PNPB and EM to confirm LC cutinase activity
P. putida can grow on PCA as sole carbon source, but not TPA
E. coli expressing LC-cutinase with pelB leader sequence grew on M9 plates with PET as sole carbon source. Expected to be due to consumption of ethylene glycol from PET degradation
Unable to determine enzyme efficiency based on growth due to heterogeneity in PET distribution
Measured fluorescence of TPA on plates, unable to quantify LC cutinase activity
Harvard BioDesign
Petase function confirmed with PNPB
Bacteria produced electric current when supplied with unspecified quantity of TPA
Tianjin
EM confirmation of PETase activity of PET film degradation
Multispectral scanning quantified PETase products for cell free system
TJUSLS China
HPLC detection of MHET to confirm PETase activity in varying conditions
Surface display of PETase in E. coli
UESTC-China
SEM and PNPB to confirm PETase activity
Possible detection of TPA by UV vis (higher absorbance across spectrum)
UoA New Zealand
Assembled PETase part with His tag
2017
Baltimore Bio-Crew
Fluorescine diacetate hydrolysis assay to confirm PETase and MHETase hydrolytic activity
BOKU-Vienna
Discussion of a possible method for directed evolution of PETase by culturing cells on PET film that fluoresces when degraded
ITB Indonesia
Successful biofilm formation on PET, but biofilm matrix hampered PETase activity
Engineered E. coli ethylene glycol metabolism with directed evolution
