Recognizing Those Who Helped Us
Special Individuals
We would like to acknowledge and thank following people for providing us with the resources, advice, and connections that made our project possible:
Dr. Eiji Masai, Nagoya University of Technology - Provided us with tph enzymes for our TPA sensor
Dr. Jason Khan, UMD Biochemistry - Acted as a mentor to the team. Attended lab meetings, provided advice, organized an iGEM seminar, and helped to make iGEM a wonderful experience.
Dr. Edward Eisenstein, UMD IBBR - Acted as a mentor to the team. Attended lab meetings, provided advice, organized an iGEM seminar, and helped to make iGEM a wonderful experience.
Dan Trettel - Acted as a mentor to the team. Attended lab meetings, provided advice, and helped to make iGEM a wonderful experience.
Dr. Ramesh Jha - Shared experience with developing PcaU, provided advice on its use.
iGEM Teams and Collaborations
We would like to acknowledge the students and advisors of the following groups, who contributed to the designs of our projects, and enabled us to learn through outreach efforts:
Walter and Ryan, Baltimore Biolab - Helped us with our cellulose
iGEM Makerere and Alex Kyaborongo - Shared experience on work with PETase
RHIT iGEM - Provided insight into results of PETase secretion that aided our decision
Yale iGEM - Provided further insight into PETase secretion
Laboratories
We would like to thank the following groups for their scientific advice and support:
Eisenstein Research Group, UMD IBBR - They performed HPLC to analyze our PET degradation process and provided our E. coli BL21 cells.
Kahn Research Group, UMD Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry - Provided us with reagents and access to their equipment, including their shaker and electroporator
Jay Lab, UMD Department of Bioengineering - An iGEM member working in this lab conducted several experiments
Murphy Lab, UMD Plant Sciences - Provided us access to their equipment such as their microplate reader
Qi Lab, UMD Department of Plant Sciences and Landscape Architecture - Provided us access to their equipment such as their NanoDrop and their gel imager
UMD Bioprocess Scale Up Facility - iGEM members working there cultured and induced several samples of bacteria
All of the cloning, assembly, and wet lab work not mentioned were conducted by the iGEM students.
