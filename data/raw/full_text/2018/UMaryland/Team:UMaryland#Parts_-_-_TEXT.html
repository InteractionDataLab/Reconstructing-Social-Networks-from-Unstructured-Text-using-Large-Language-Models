Our Contribution to the Registry
BBa_K2825000
PETase-Linker-CBDcipA-Linker-HlyA tag + HlyBD secretion system
The PETase fusion protein is expressed on an inducible T7 promoter to be excreted extracellularly with an HlyA tag and an alpha-hemolysin secretion system (iGEM13_TecMonterrey BBa_K1166002). The PETase fusion protein is comprised of isPETase (), and a cellulose binding domain.
BBa_K2825002
PcaU Sensor
Biosensor for protocatechuic acid (PCA), downstream degradation product of PET degradation. This sensor is optimized for BL21 DE3 E. coli and, when attached to a fluorescent reporter, can differentiate single micromolar PCA concentrations. PcaU itself is an inducible iclr transcription factor.
