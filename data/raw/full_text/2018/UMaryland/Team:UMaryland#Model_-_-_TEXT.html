Predicting Outcomes To Direct Our Projects
One of the primary goals of our project, PETNET, was to be informed and deliberate in our approach.
We employed Matlab Simbiology to make a critical decision on which of two biosensors to select in order to detect PET degradation.
We also used modeling to justify the use of a bacterial cellulose domain for increased biodegradation before pursuing further work.
