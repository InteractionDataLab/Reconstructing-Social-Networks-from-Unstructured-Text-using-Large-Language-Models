UMaryland with iGEM ambassador Holly M. Bowman and mentors Dr. Jason Kahn and Dr. Edward Eisenstein
UMaryland iGEM is made of dedicated undergraduates who are passionate about improving the world through synthetic biology. They are from a variety of backgrounds, majors, and interest that contribute their talents through lab work, outreach, fundraising, wiki coding, video editing, social media, and photography. They dedicate their time through a spring seminar, summer work, and finishing up of the project in the fall.
Mentors
UMaryland iGEM is lead by two faculty advisers: Dr. Edward Eisenstein in the Fischell Department of Bioengineering, and Dr. Jason Kahn in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. They help evaluate project proposals, attend regular lab meetings, connect us to resources on and off campus.
Dr. Jason Kahn
Jason D. Kahn is a biophysical chemist who studies protein-nucleic acid interaction and engineering. He is best known for studies of DNA looping, bending, twisting, and cyclization, as well as hybridization thermodynamics for modified bases. He teaches a variety of chemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology courses, which he credits for initiating his interest in synthetic biology. Dr. Kahn was a graduate student at UC Berkeley and a post-doc at Yale before coming to Maryland in 1994.
Dr. Edward Eisenstein
Edward Eisenstein is a Fellow in the Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research and an Associate Professor in the Fischell Department of Bioengineering at the University of Maryland. Trained in modern structural enzymology, his current research interests are focused on protein and biosystem engineering for discovery and application in plants and microorganisms.
