Educating the Next Generation
Tarbiryah Academy
Over the summer, members of the lab volunteered at a science fair hosted by Tarbiryah Academy to teach the next generation of young scientists. We had a pipetting and micropipetting lab to teach young kids basic lab techniques. We then had an agar plate demonstration (which was fun to play with!) to teach them what bacteria are and how we can transform bacteria, introducing the current and future potential of engineering bacteria as biological machines to tackle real world problems.
MdBio
Our team also worked with MdBio at a Water Conservation Fair with the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC).  With MdBio, members of our team held pipetting experiments, an activity with non-newtonian fluids, a demonstration of coke and mentos reaction, and an engineering challenge outside their mobile lab. Once again we had a great time interacting with parents and future young scientists.
