                        Glutathione (GSH) is biosynthesized from glutamic acid, cysteine and glycine, and distributes
                        in many organs in human body, especially in the liver where the highest concentration of GSH
                        exists. GSH plays an important role in liver biochemical metabolism. GSH can inhibit the
                        formation of fatty liver, directly antagonize the toxicity of oxygen free radicals, prevent
                        hepatocyte injury and treat of fulminant hepatic failure caused by drug poisoning.

                        S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) is an important intermediate product in liver metabolism. As a

                        important metabolic reactions in vivo. SAM can delay the need for liver transplantation and

                        CwaA protein encoded by gene cwaA is a cell wall-anchored protein. The C terminus of CwaA
                        contains an LPQTDE (LPxTG-like cell wall anchoring) motif belonging to the gram-positive LPxTG
                        anchor superfamily. Aside from the hexapeptide motif at the C terminus, CwaA possesses five
                        cell wall surface anchor repeat domains. The specific hit domains of CwaA included epiglycanin
                        (tandem-repeating region of mucin), OmpC (outer membrane protein), PT (the tetrapeptide XPTX
