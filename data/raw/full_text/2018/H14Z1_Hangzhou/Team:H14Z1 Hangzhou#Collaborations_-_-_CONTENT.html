                        This year, we made a collaboration with SZU-China in Shenzhen University. We helped them make
                        some new content of their WeChat-based Mini Program. We gave them detailed feedback after using
                        it, and shared our familiar experience with them about how to promote it to more and more high
                        schools. In return, they did much work to screen several compatible strains, which were used by
                        us to screen the suitable strain to produce our “smart yogurts ” combined with our constructed
                        L. lactis. They went to the supermarket, bought various bands and different conditions of
                        yogurt for them, including Classy·Kiss and CHENGUANG DAIRY, finally isolated several local
                        strains, which were mailed to us for our strain screening plan.

                        In the present project, since the oral table administration of GSH and SAM have some
                        disadvantages, such as low stability and short life span, here we tried to develop a novel
                        in-vivo strategy of produce and deliver them simultaneously by using NICE system. In the
                        experiment, two-functional GSH synthetase gene (gshF) and SAM synthetase gene (metK) were in
                        tandem inserted into the expression vector (pNZ8148), and the resulted plasmid (pNZ8148-SG) was
                        employed to construct the target vector pNZ8148-SGC by introducing adhesion factor gene (cwaA).
                        This target vector was transformed to get recombinant Lactococcus lacti, which was employed to
                        produce our “smart yogurt”.

                        As team XMU-China’s HSFCM data shown, OmpA-ST inside OMVs could be detected. To validate the
                        ST/SC conjugation inside OMVs, they linked BBa_K2623022/BBa_K2623024 with BBa_K2623025 (NG5) to
                        form BBa_K2623028 and BBa_K2623030 respectively. Hence, they need to demonstrate the
                        SC-L7Ae-mRFP1 inside E. coli BL21 to validate its presence inside E. coli BL21 and therefore
                        OMVs. We measured the RFP intensity versus OD600 value (RFP intensity/OD600) of E. coli
                        transfected with NG5 to test the function of NG5.

                        XMU-China gave a good demonstrative example for our smart yogurt conception by preparing our
                        special yogurt and determined the cell number and contents of two liver-protective agents. The
                        process and results were described in the following:
                    </P><P style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">1) Yogurt production process</P><P class="content_context">
                        We provided them the yogurt formula ( raw milk 93%, white granulated sugar 7%) and two strains
                        (L. lactis NZ9000 and L. lactis NZ9000/pGMcA). They did the following steps for the process: 1)
                        Heating raw milk to 55-60 oC, add a quantity of sugar, then stir then for 10 minutes at 3000
                        rpm, finally heat up to 65 oC; 2) keep the culture medium at 65 oC for two-stage homogenization
                        (5/20MPa), then do the sterilization at 90 oC for 5 minutes. Then cool down to 30 oC for the
                        next inoculation; 3) Inoculate the milk-containing medium with suitable amount of L. lactis
                        NZ9000 or L. lactis NZ9000/pGMcA, meanwhile the mixed amino acids were supplemented suitabley.
                        Each fermentation process was maintained for 12 hour at 30 oC, and both of the end pH was
                        around 4.6. Several samples were taken out carefully at some time points.
                    </P><P style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">2) Product analysis</P><P class="content_context">
                        The comparison was made for product quality by using different strains. The results showed that
                        the recombinant strain (NZ9000/pGMcA) had a little lower growth rate with regard the original
                        host, but the function of the combinatory module was fully confirmed by measuring the content
                        of the yogurts. The original host did produce GSH during the whole process, but the recombinant
                        cells raised GSH concentration up to 11.8mg/l, which is quite comparable to the data in our
                        laboratory. They also proved that the original host can produce a small amount of SAM during
                        its growth process, but the introduction of our composite module did improved the SAM
                        biosynthesis greatly. Moreover, high density (1.0 x 109/ml) of the strain NZ9000/pGMcA gave the
                        good potential for their continuous biosynthesis of GSH and SAM in human gastrointestinal
                        tract.
