                        GM foods currently available on the international market have passed safety assessments and are
                        not likely to present risks for human health. In addition, no effects on human health have been
                        shown as a result of the consumption of such foods by the general population in the countries
                        where they have been approved.

                        Currently available transgenic crops and foods derived from them have been judged safe to eat
                        and the methods used to test their safety have been deemed appropriate. To date no verifiable
                        untoward toxic or nutritionally deleterious effects resulting from the consumption of foods
                        derived from genetically modified crops have been discovered anywhere in the world (GM Science
                        Review Panel). Many millions of people have consumed foods derived from GM plants – mainly
                        maize, soybean and oilseed rape – without any observed adverse effects (ICSU).

                        The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a
                        period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research
                        groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are not per se more risky than e.g.
                        conventional plant breeding technologies. These activities provide at least equal assurance of
                        the safety of these foods compared to conventional counterparts, provided these GM products
                        have been approved by the EU and the national food safety evaluation procedures.

                        Regulation of GM crops in the United States is divided among three regulatory agencies: the
                        Environmental Projection Agency (EPA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the U.S.
                        Department of Agriculture (USDA). Each of these agencies regulates transgenic crops from a
                        different perspective. FDA is responsible for regulating the safety of GM crops that are eaten
                        by humans or animals. According to a policy established in 1992, FDA considers most GM crops as
                        “substantially equivalent” to non-GM crops. In such cases, GM crops are designated as
                        “Generally Recognized as Safe” under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and do
                        not require pre-market approval.
