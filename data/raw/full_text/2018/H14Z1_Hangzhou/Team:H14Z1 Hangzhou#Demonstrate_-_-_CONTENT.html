                        It is known that <I>L. lactis</I> NZ9000 cannot form GSH and can form little SAM by itself. As shown
                        in Figure.1, no GSH was detected in <I>L. lactis</I> NZ9000 as expected. And GSH was obviously
                        appeared during the fermentation, illustrating that GSH module was effective. And Figure.2
                        showed that more SAM were accumulated in strain <I>L. lactis</I>/pNZ-GMcA than wild-type, illustrating
                        the good function of SAM module.
