                        In order to learn the general information on the treatment of liver diseases,
                        <B>Jiajun and Nanting</B>
                        went to the First Hospital of Zhejiang Province to consult with clinic doctors, visit
                        patients with liver diseases. Especially, some patients gave many good suggestions to protect
                        human liver in the daily life, which are included in the following:

                        1) Night time is the best time for the liver to detoxify. It is unfavorable to eat at night for
                        our liver health since this life style invisibly increases the metabolic burden of the liver.
                    </P><P class="content_context" style="text-indent:2em; text-align: justify">
                        2) Excessive wine drinking will harm the liver. When alcohol enters the body, it is metabolized
                        mainly in the liver and has direct damage to the liver.
                    </P><P class="content_context" style="text-indent:2em; text-align: justify">
                        3) Avoid misuse, abuse of drugs. We should carefully follow the doctorsâ€™ instruction or
                        standardize drug usage.
                    </P><P class="content_context" style="text-indent:2em; text-align: justify">
                        4) Greasy food, especially high fat food, can invisibly increase the metabolic burden of the
                        liver, and in the long run can seriously affect the normal functioning of the liver.
                    </P><P class="content_context" style="text-indent:2em; text-align: justify">
                        5) Do not abuse some so-called healthy products to prevent liver damage caused by drugs.

                        In order to understand liver disease more deeply,
                        <B>Chutian</B> went to Zheda Hospital to visit
                        several doctors for their suggestions. And five teammates went to visit several medical Doctors
                        in The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University.
                        <B>Dr. Chen Yuanchi and Dr. Xu Zhipeng</B> in
                        their research center of liver and gallbladder told us the recent progress of hepatobiliary and
                        pancreatic surgery. We learned that hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery is a sub-specialty of
                        general surgery, mainly facing patients with liver, biliary and pancreatic diseases. The liver
                        is an important organ of life, and liver disease can affect the whole body. However, up to now,
                        they have not fully understood the pathology, physiology, pathogenesis of the liver, there are
                        still many serious diseases to be solved in the future. The two notable characteristics of
                        hepatobiliary surgery are complex and difficult, thus chemical drug is a good choice.
