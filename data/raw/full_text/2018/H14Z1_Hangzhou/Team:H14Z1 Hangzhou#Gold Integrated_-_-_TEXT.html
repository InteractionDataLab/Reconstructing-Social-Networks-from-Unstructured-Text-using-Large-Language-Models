Activity A
With the guidance of Dr. Guanchen Liuï¼Œour team members started to use their facilities                         to                         produce yogurt in the bench-top fermentor. Several different yogurts were successfully produced                         with a variety of strain modes by us.
Activity B
We went to give one seminar for the AP students in our AP center of Hangzhou No. 14 High                         School. In the seminar, we introduced the common liver diseases, explained the prevention of                         liver diseases in daily life, and popularized the treatment of liver diseases. Of course, our                         student leader also introduced our project and 2018 iGEM loudly. Besides, we encouraged the                         audience to check their body regularly and prevent the incurrence of liver diseases.
Activity C
We have surveyed more than 30 enterprises, including state-owned, private, foreign enterprise                         and sino foreign joint venture, distributed in different area and countries. Most of them                         produce drugs, food and beverages.
Liver is an important metabolic organ in human body. The protection and treatment of liver have                         always been a hot topic for enterprises. In this survey, more than 70% of enterprises expressed                         interest in the production and development of liver treatment and protection medicine. However,                         few enterprises are producing GSH and SAM.
According to our surveys, we found that minority enterprises account for most of the market in                         the production of GSH and SAM no matter in domestic or foreign. Most of them do not produce. In                         addition to the cause of unconversant, the main problems are difficult product purification,                         complex production process and then the high cost and low yield.
Surveys about GSH market and confronting problems
Surveys about SAM market and confronting problems
Surveys showed that our program has two advantages that are acknowledged: firstly, the drugs in                         yogurt can stay in the body for a long period, reducing the number and dosage of drugs;                         secondly, the yogurt can serve two purposes for taking in GSH and SAM simultaneously.
However, the surveyed companies think that it might be better to add GSH and SAM directly into                         yogurt and we should pay more attention to instability of engineered bacteria. They suggested                         that more safety assessment and scientific researches are needed. Even so, most of them                         consider that our technology is innovative and has willingness or potential willingness to                         cooperate with us to produce smart yogurts containing GSH and SAM.
Overall, our program is innovative, entrepreneurial, and contributes to the research of liver                         disease significantly. According to the surveys, it has tremendous potentials to be                         industrialized.
