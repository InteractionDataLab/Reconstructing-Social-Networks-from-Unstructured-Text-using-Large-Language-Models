                        At the very beginning, we went to three hospitals to investigate current status for the
                        incurrence and treatment of liver diseases by consulting with clinic doctors, medical
                        researchers and patients. With the budding of smart yogurt concept in our brains, we visited
                        one local yogurt research center and make discussion with a top-level researcher on how to
                        utilize Lactococus lactis to produce two liver-protective agents in gastrointestine tract. And
                        a variety of activities were made to publicize the iGEM competition and our project. Luckily we
                        are supported to prepare our smart yogurt in one local food company. After that we tried to
                        evaluate industrial potentials of our product and technologies by finishing one unusual
                        questionnaire by inviting more than thirty companies to take part in. This integrated human
                        practices was necessary for the commercialization of our innovated products, and our
                        whole-process human practice will also be demonstrative to other teams
