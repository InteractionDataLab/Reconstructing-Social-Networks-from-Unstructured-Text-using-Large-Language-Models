                        Previous experiments had shown that BBa_J04450-transformed E.coli BL21(DE3) would turn red
                        color under natural light after 18 hours due to leaking expression. This part is useful for
                        characterizing the expression of different proteins using the lacI sensitive promoter. For
                        better application of this promoter in controlling protein expression, the effects of different
                        hosts under various conditions were investigated systematically. The target hosts include E.
                        coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli MC1061. The target culture conditions were temperature, inducer
                        concentration and medium volume in the flask.

                        The mRFP expression of two strains showed the same trend in different volume of medium in the
                        flask. After 6 hours, the fluorescence intensity in 30 ml medium-containing flask is
                        significantly higher than others, indicating that mRFP express fastest in this volume scale
                        (Fig 3). This suggest that dissolved oxygen is an important factor which will affect the
                        protein expressin and cell growth, since the lower medium volume in the same type flask will
                        bring about higher level of dissolved oxygen in the medium.

                        Our results showed that significant fluorescence differences were not observed by using
                        different IPTG induction (Fig 3). However, it is interesting that the fluorescence intensity of
                        BL21(DE3) after IPTG induction are higher than those of MC1061, not similar to the trend in our
                        previous experiment (Fig 2). It might be explained that the expression of mRFP can be
                        accelerated by IPTG inductin in BL21(DE3) with regard to other E. coli hosts.
