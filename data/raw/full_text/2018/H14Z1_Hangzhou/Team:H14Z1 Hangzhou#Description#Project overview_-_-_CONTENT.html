                        is one of the most common organisms used in bacterial drug delivery system.

                        is a food-grade bacterium that is widely used in the dairy industry. It is a
                        Gram-positive bacterium and therefore lacks endotoxic lipopolysaccharides (LPS) which are
                        associated with commonly used 
                        <A href="http://www.discoverymedicine.com/category/species-and-cell-types/bacterium/gram-negative-bacteria/">Gram-negative bacteria</A>
                        . It is also non-invasive and non-commensal
                        and thus has less potential to trigger immunotolerance or side effects upon prolonged use. The
                        bacterium has an established safety profile through its long use in fermented dairy products
                        and is considered as a GRAS (generally recognized as safe) microorganism. During the last two
                        decades, significant advances have been made in the field of lactococcal genetics and protein
                        expression systems. The most commonly used system is the nisin-controlled gene expression
                        (NICE) system, containing the nisin promoter. Consequently, we have seen the emergence of new
                        areas for the application of engineered L. lactis for protein expression,

                        In the present project, since the oral table administration of GSH and SAM have some
                        disadvantages, such as low stability and short life span, here we tried to develop a novel
                        in-vivo strategy of produce and deliver them simultaneously by using NICE system. In the
                        experiment, two-functional GSH synthetase gene (gshF) and SAM synthetase gene (metK) were in
                        tandem inserted into the expression vector (pNZ8148), and the resulted plasmid (pNZ8148-SG) was
                        employed to construct the target vector pNZ8148-SGC by introducing adhesion factor gene (cwaA).
                        This target vector was transformed to get recombinant Lactococcus lacti, which was employed to
                        produce our “smart yogurt”.
