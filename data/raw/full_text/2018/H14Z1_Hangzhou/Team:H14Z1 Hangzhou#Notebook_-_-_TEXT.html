January
1) We heard about the significant competition in synthetic biology - iGEM, and developed a                         strong                         interest in participating in this grand competition.
2) Then we set up a team in Hangzhou No.14 High School.
February
1) The team was organized finally and the team members brainstormed the competition project. We                         used the winter vacation to visit three hospitals to investigate the incurrence rate of liver                         disease, visit patients and make a survey about how to prevent and treat liver disease.
March
1) With the suggestions of advisors, we choose to express GSH and SAM in Lactococcus lactis,                         since both are helpful to protect the liver. And one gene of adhesion factor was considered to                         increase the retention time of Lactococcus lactis in the intestinal tract of human body.
2) Make a trip to the local yogurt research center to study the procedure.
April
1) The plasmids containing the biosynthetic gene (gshF and metK) was constructed respectively,                         and the expression was carried out in Lactococcus lactis.
2) Make a Wechat public account to send out articles regularly.
3) Give lecture in the AP center in our campus. Help High school students and community                         residents learn knowledge about protection and treatment for the liver, and synthetic biology.
May
1) Two modules of GSH and SAM are connected by Gibson. To achieve tandem expression in                         Lactococcus lactis. the modules of GSH, SAM and adhesion factor were integrated into the same                         plasmid (E. coli and Lactococcus lactis shuttle plasmid). The target plasmid was successfully                         transformed.
June
1) A number of articles on WeChat public account have been thrown out.
2) At the same time, some team members start brainstorming the wiki design. After reading a                         large number of award-winning wiki, they determine the style and main content of Wiki. Some of                         the team members are assigned to design some wiki parts.
3) Get in touch with the iGEM team of Xiamen University and Shenzhen University to establish a                         cooperative relationship.
July
1) The iGEM team of Shenzhen University delivered several strains isolated from a variety of                         yogurts .
2) The contents of GSH and SAM in the culture were detected by HPLC, and the optimization of                         their production was made. The cell growth curve was also obtained.
August
1) The effect of adhesion factor was verified by sedimentation experiment.
2) Began the modeling work.
3) We improved the expression of one existing module in the website.
4) Help Xiamen University iGEM team measure gene circuits.
5) We released our iGEM project in the WeChat-based mini-program created by iGEM team of                         Shenzhen University.
September
1) We were supported to utilize the facilities to produce different yogurts in a local company                         2) Complete most of wiki design work.
3) Optimization of experimental results.
4) The iGEM team of Xiamen University helped our team to detect the results of the fermented                         yogurts there.
5) We tested the expression of the gene module of Xiamen University in our team lab.
6) Two teammates organized a trip to West Lake, and donated the West Lake tourism guide map,                         of course ,combined with iGEM theme.
7) Questionnaires were specially designed to investigate the potential of our technology in industry in the future.
October
1) Complete all the experiments, submit all biological bricks, and complete the building of the whole webpage.
2) Apply one invention patent in China.
3) Prepare PPT for the final Giant Jamboree, practice the speech.
