Project overview
Liver function and protection
Lactococcus lactis is one of the most common organisms used in bacterial drug delivery system. Lactococcus lactis is a food-grade bacterium that is widely used in the dairy industry. It is a                         Gram-positive bacterium and therefore lacks endotoxic lipopolysaccharides (LPS) which are                         associated with commonly used Gram-negative bacteria . It is also non-invasive and non-commensal                         and thus has less potential to trigger immunotolerance or side effects upon prolonged use. The                         bacterium has an established safety profile through its long use in fermented dairy products                         and is considered as a GRAS (generally recognized as safe) microorganism. During the last two                         decades, significant advances have been made in the field of lactococcal genetics and protein                         expression systems. The most commonly used system is the nisin-controlled gene expression                         (NICE) system, containing the nisin promoter. Consequently, we have seen the emergence of new                         areas for the application of engineered L. lactis for protein expression, gene delivery ,                         vaccine delivery, and therapeutic drug delivery.
In the present project, since the oral table administration of GSH and SAM have some                         disadvantages, such as low stability and short life span, here we tried to develop a novel                         in-vivo strategy of produce and deliver them simultaneously by using NICE system. In the                         experiment, two-functional GSH synthetase gene (gshF) and SAM synthetase gene (metK) were in                         tandem inserted into the expression vector (pNZ8148), and the resulted plasmid (pNZ8148-SG) was                         employed to construct the target vector pNZ8148-SGC by introducing adhesion factor gene (cwaA).                         This target vector was transformed to get recombinant Lactococcus lacti, which was employed to                         produce our “smart yogurt”.
The project is outlined with two stages：
Stage AConstruction of Lactococcus lactis NZ9000/pNZ-SGC
Stage BPreparation of smart yogurt with our constructed Lactococcus lactis
