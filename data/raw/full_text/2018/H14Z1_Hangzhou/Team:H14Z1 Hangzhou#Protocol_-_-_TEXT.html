Protocol
1. Media
Luria-Bertan (LB) medium: 10 g/L tryptone, 10 g/L NaCl, 5 g/L yeast extract;                         GM17 medium: M17 Broth with 0.2M KH2PO4, adjust pH to 6.8 with 2M NaOH, 10 g/L glucose;                         G-SGM17 medium: M17-Broth with 0.5 M sucrose, 2.5% glycine, 0.5% glucose.
2. PCR
DNA segments were amplified with PrimeSTAR Max DNA Polymerase (Takara). Reaction mixture was                         prepared as follows:
Reaction conditions were set as follows:
3. SDS-PAGE
1) Set the casting frames (clamp two glass plates in the casting frames) on the casting stands.
2) Prepare the 12% separating gel as follows:
Swirl the solution gently but thoroughly. Pipet appropriate amount of separating gel solution                         into the gap between the glass plates. To make the top of the separating gel be horizontal,                         fill in isopropanol into the gap until an overflow. Wait for 20-30min to let it gelate.
3) Prepare stacking gel as follows:
Discard the isopropanol and pipet in stacking gel until an overflow. Insert the well-forming                         comb without trapping air under the teeth. Wait for 20-30min to let it gelate.
4) Take out the comb after a complete gelation of the stacking gel. Take the glass plates out                         of the casting frame and set them in the cell buffer dam. Pour the electrophoresis buffer into                         the inner chamber and keep pouring after overflow untill the buffer surface reaches the                         required level in the outer chamber.
5) Prepare the samples:
Mix the samples with loading buffer. Heat them in boiling water for 5-10 min. The loading                         buffer contains:
6) Load prepared samples into wells and make sure not to overflow. Load protein marker into the                         first lane. Then cover the top and connect the anodes.
7) Set the volt as 100 V and run the electrophoresis for 30 min. Then, switch to 180 V and keep                         running till the blue band reaches the bottom line of the separating gel.
8) Take out the SDS-PAGE gel and put it in staining solution. Stain for 30 min at 100rpm.
9) Pour out the staining solution, wash the gel once with water and immerse it in destaining                         solution for 30 min at 100 rpm.
Change the destaining solution for several times. When the protein bands become clear, observe                         it in lights and take pictures.

7.2 GSH
CIntracellular GSH was extracted by resuspending cells in 1.2M perchloric acid and cultivating                         for 4 hours at 4℃. Cell resuspension was reverse blended every 30 min to prevent cell                         aggregation.

Agilent 1100 series with a UV absorption detector and a reverse phase Agilent TC-C18                         (2) column was used for HPLC. The mobile phase was 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 3.0,                         with 10 mM sodium heptanesulfonate and 5% methanol. The column temperature was set at 30 ℃ and                         flow rate at 1.0 ml/min. Quantification of GSH was based on its absorbance at 210 nm

Cell extracts were centrifuged at 12,000g for 3 min, the supernatant was taken for HPLC                         analysis. Agilent 1100 series with a UV absorption detector and a reverse phase Agilent TC-C18                         (2) column was used for HPLC. The mobile phase was 40 mM ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, with 10                         mM sodium heptanesulfonate and 18% methanol. The flow rate was set at 1.0 ml/min and column                         temperature not controlled. Quantification of SAM was based on its absorbance at 254 nm[5].

To evaluate auto-aggregation rate, cells were collected and washed twice with o.1M PBS buffer                         (pH=7.0) and resuspended in 4ml PBS buffer (pH=7.0) with an initial OD600=0.5 (A0). The final                         OD600 (At) of the uppermost layer was measured after 4 hours’ cultivation in 30℃ without                         shaking. The auto-aggregation value was calculated using the following equation:
Autoaggregation (%)=100-(At/A0)×100
