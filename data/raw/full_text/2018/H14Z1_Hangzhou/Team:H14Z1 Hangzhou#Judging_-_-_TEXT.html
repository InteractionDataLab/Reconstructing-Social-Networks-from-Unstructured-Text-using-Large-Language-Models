Special prizes
The core synthetic biology modules were integrated into the yogurt, which brought about one                         special “smart yogurt” called by us. More details for our  product design .
In order to investigating the recent status of liver diseases, we visited three hospitals, and                         also make an industrial survey in a famous local company. We did much work to introduce iGEM                         and our projects to the community. Finally, we carried out the questionnaire for the potential                         of our smart yogurt for industrialization. More details for  Human Practices .
We have invented a new high technology to produce two protective agents in the yogurt, and this smart yogurt concept is relatively easier to be understand and accepted by general public. One                         local company have some relations with our iGEM group and want to build a biotechnology to run                         this project. More details for the section see Entrepreneurship.
We apply mathematical models and computer simulations in our project and help our project more                         perfect. More details for  Modeling
