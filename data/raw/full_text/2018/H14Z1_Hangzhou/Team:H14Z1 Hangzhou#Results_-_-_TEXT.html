Construction of the expression plasmids
Three genes ( gshF, metK and cwaA) were cloned to plasmid pNZ8148 to form three modules (GSH                         module, SAM module and Adhesion factor module). Each module contained Pnis promoter (containing                         RBS sequence), the coding gene and terminator. Then, GSH module and SAM module were combined                         together to construct plasmid pNZ-GM. GSH module, SAM module and adhesion factor module were                         combined together to construct the final plasmid pNZ-GMcA.

Design and integration of three different modules (gshF, met K                         and cwaA)
Two fragments were chosen in the constructed plasmid to validate the validity. Fragment 1                         named gm containing gene gshF and metK was 3670 bp and fragment 2 named cA containing gene                         cwaA was 3079 bp. As shown in Figure. 2, all the picked colonies contains gene gshF, metK                         and cwaA, illustrating that the plasmid pNZ-GMcA was successfully constructed.

SDS-PAGE detection of protein GshF and MetK
In order to validate the availability of the modules expressed in the plasmid pNZ-GMcA. We                         carried out SDS-PAGE analysis of protein GshF and MetK. GshF protein is about 86kDa and MetK                         protein is about 43 kDa. As shown in Figure. 3, expected bands of GshF and MetK protein were                         observed on the gel. Recombinant L.lactis containing pNZ-GMcA induced with different nisin                         concentration showed higher expression of MetK protein than wild-type. These results                         illustrated the successfully expression of GSH module and SAM module in plasmid pNZ-GMcA.
