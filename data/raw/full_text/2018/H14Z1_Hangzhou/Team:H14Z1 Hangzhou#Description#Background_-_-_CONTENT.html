                        Good health is dependent upon proper liver function. The liver is a huge chemical plant of the
                        human body. It has many major functions as shown in Fig.1. In the daily life, as shown in
                        Fig.2, there are many reasons which overload liver to disease. Liver disease can be divided
                        into viral liver and non viral liver diseases. Non viral liver diseases consist of alcoholic
                        liver, drug or toxic liver disease, metabolic abnormal liver disease, fatty liver, etc.

                        Liver disease is a common disease with great danger. And the incidence rate in East Asia is
                        higher than the average in the world. Scientists have made great efforts to prevent or treat it
                        by hepatitis virus vaccine inoculation, clinic operation, and medicine administration, etc. At
                        present oral administration of two protective drugs (glutathione and S-adenosyl methionine) is
                        very effective against a variety of liver diseases in hospital.

                        Glutathione (GSH) is biosynthesized from glutamic acid, cysteine and glycine, and distributes
                        in many organs in human body, especially in the liver where the highest concentration of GSH
                        exists. GSH plays an important role in liver biochemical metabolism. The liver therapeutical
                        effects of glutathione are listed in the following:

                        S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) is an important intermediate product in liver metabolism. As a
                        methyl donor and a precursor of physiological sulfhydryl compounds, SAM participates in
                        important metabolic reactions in vivo. The liver therapeutical effects of SAM are listed in the

                        Oral administration is the most attractive option for drug delivery due to convenience of
                        administration, patient acceptance, and long-term compliance. However, this strategy is not
                        feasible for many drugs, especially peptide or protein drugs, due to poor biochemical stability
                        (degradation and denaturation) in the harsh gastrointestinal environment (Fig.3) and low
                        epithelial permeability. Synthetic cell therapy is a ﬁeld that has broad potential for future
                        applications in human disease treatment. In vivo synthesis and delivery via cell therapy has
                        several important advantages over traditional oral systemic treatment. First, the required
                        dosage of the therapeutic agent is reduced by several orders of magnitude to achieve a
                        comparable therapeutic eﬀect. This helps in reducing undesired side eﬀects, both at the site of
                        delivery and elsewhere in the body. Second, the route of administration is less invasive than
                        intravenous or subcutaneous injection. For example, certain diseases of the gastrointestinal
                        tract could be treated, by oral administration of a synthetic bacterium that can traverse to
                        the desired location. Third, multiple therapeutic agents can be produced by the same cell
                        simultaneously as a combination therapy. Finally, in vivo production and delivery by a
                        synthetic chassis provides a more cost-eﬀective treatment as it obviates the need for
                        puriﬁcation and formulation of the active compound. In this area, many different agents were
                        tried to be synthesized and delivered in-vivo with a variety of microbes (Fig.3).
