Liver function and protection
Good health is dependent upon proper liver function. The liver is a huge chemical plant of the                         human body. It has many major functions as shown in Fig.1. In the daily life, as shown in                         Fig.2, there are many reasons which overload liver to disease. Liver disease can be divided                         into viral liver and non viral liver diseases. Non viral liver diseases consist of alcoholic                         liver, drug or toxic liver disease, metabolic abnormal liver disease, fatty liver, etc.

Protection agents
Liver disease is a common disease with great danger. And the incidence rate in East Asia is                         higher than the average in the world. Scientists have made great efforts to prevent or treat it                         by hepatitis virus vaccine inoculation, clinic operation, and medicine administration, etc. At                         present oral administration of two protective drugs (glutathione and S-adenosyl methionine) is                         very effective against a variety of liver diseases in hospital.
Glutathione
Glutathione (GSH) is biosynthesized from glutamic acid, cysteine and glycine, and distributes                         in many organs in human body, especially in the liver where the highest concentration of GSH                         exists. GSH plays an important role in liver biochemical metabolism. The liver therapeutical                         effects of glutathione are listed in the following:
Inhibit the formation of fatty liver.
Directly antagonize the toxicity of oxygen free radicals.
Preventing hepatocyte injury.
Treatment of fulminant hepatic failure caused by drug poisoning.

S-adenosyl methionine
S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) is an important intermediate product in liver metabolism. As a                         methyl donor and a precursor of physiological sulfhydryl compounds, SAM participates in                         important metabolic reactions in vivo. The liver therapeutical effects of SAM are listed in the                         following:
Delay the need for liver transplantation and reduce mortality in patients with                                 alcoholic cirrhosis in a 24-month trial.
Significantly increase hepatic glutathione levels in nonalcoholic liver disease with                                 oral administration of 1200mg SAM daily
(J Hepatol 1999, 30(6) 1081-1089).
Bacterial drug delivery system
Oral administration is the most attractive option for drug delivery due to convenience of                         administration, patient acceptance, and long-term compliance. However, this strategy is not                         feasible for many drugs, especially peptide or protein drugs, due to poor biochemical stability                         (degradation and denaturation) in the harsh gastrointestinal environment (Fig.3) and low                         epithelial permeability. Synthetic cell therapy is a ﬁeld that has broad potential for future                         applications in human disease treatment. In vivo synthesis and delivery via cell therapy has                         several important advantages over traditional oral systemic treatment.
The required dosage is reduced by several orders of magnitude.
The route of administration is less invasive than intravenous or subcutaneous                                 injection.
Multiple therapeutic agents can be produced by the same cell simultaneously.
No need for puriﬁcation and formulation of the active compound.
Our objective
Lactococcus lactis is one of the most common organisms used in bacterial drug delivery system. Lactococcus lactis is a food-grade bacterium that is widely used in the dairy industry. It is a                         Gram-positive bacterium and therefore lacks endotoxic lipopolysaccharides (LPS) which are                         associated with commonly used Gram-negative bacteria. It is also non-invasive and non-commensal                         and thus has less potential to trigger immunotolerance or side effects upon prolonged use. The                         bacterium has an established safety profile through its long use in fermented dairy products                         and is considered as a GRAS (generally recognized as safe) microorganism. During the last two                         decades, significant advances have been made in the field of lactococcal genetics and protein                         expression systems. The most commonly used system is the nisin-controlled gene expression                         (NICE) system, containing the nisin promoter.
In the present project, since the oral table administration of GSH and SAM have some                         disadvantages, such as low stability and short life span, here we tried to develop a novel                         in-vivo strategy of produce and deliver them simultaneously by using NICE system. In the                         experiment, two-functional GSH synthetase gene (gshF) and SAM synthetase gene (metK) were in                         tandem inserted into the expression vector (pNZ8148), and the resulted plasmid (pNZ8148-SG) was                         employed to construct the target vector pNZ8148-SGC by introducing adhesion factor gene (cwaA).                         This target vector was transformed to get recombinant Lactococcus lacti, which was employed to                         produce our “smart yogurt”.
