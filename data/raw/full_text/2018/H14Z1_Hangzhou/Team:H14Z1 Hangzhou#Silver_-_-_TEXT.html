Especially, some patients gave many good suggestions to protect                         human liver in the daily life, which are included in the following:
1) Night time is the best time for the liver to detoxify. It is unfavorable to eat at night for                         our liver health since this life style invisibly increases the metabolic burden of the liver.
2) Excessive wine drinking will harm the liver. When alcohol enters the body, it is metabolized                         mainly in the liver and has direct damage to the liver.
3) Avoid misuse, abuse of drugs. We should carefully follow the doctorsâ€™ instruction or                         standardize drug usage.

5) Do not abuse some so-called healthy products to prevent liver damage caused by drugs.

We learned that hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery is a sub-specialty of                         general surgery, mainly facing patients with liver, biliary and pancreatic diseases. The liver                         is an important organ of life, and liver disease can affect the whole body. However, up to now,                         they have not fully understood the pathology, physiology, pathogenesis of the liver, there are                         still many serious diseases to be solved in the future. The two notable characteristics of                         hepatobiliary surgery are complex and difficult, thus chemical drug is a good choice.
