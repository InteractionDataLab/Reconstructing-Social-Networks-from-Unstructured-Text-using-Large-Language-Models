Overview
At the very beginning, we went to three hospitals to investigate current status for the                         incurrence and treatment of liver diseases by consulting with clinic doctors, medical                         researchers and patients. With the budding of smart yogurt concept in our brains, we visited                         one local yogurt research center and make discussion with a top-level researcher on how to                         utilize Lactococus lactis to produce two liver-protective agents in gastrointestine tract. And                         a variety of activities were made to publicize the iGEM competition and our project. Luckily we                         are supported to prepare our smart yogurt in one local food company. After that we tried to                         evaluate industrial potentials of our product and technologies by finishing one unusual                         questionnaire by inviting more than thirty companies to take part in. This integrated human                         practices was necessary for the commercialization of our innovated products, and our                         whole-process human practice will also be demonstrative to other teams
