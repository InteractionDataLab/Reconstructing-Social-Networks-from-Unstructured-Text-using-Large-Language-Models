1. PI
Xiaomei TANG
-- Primary PI. As the key person of our project, she gave us a lot of professional advice. And                         she helps us coordinate the relationship of our team with the school and outside.
Zhinan XU
-- Academic mentor, Leader of the brainstorm. He organizes students to brainstorm and accept                         the                         team to do research work in his laboratory. He also recommended the experts for the young team.
2. Team members
· Experiment Module
-- As the leader of the team, Chutian was response of organizing the experiment work. This year                         we designed an expression system based on Lactococcus lactis. In order to construct our                         combinatory module,  Chutian, Zhou Ke and Qiaoyu completed the work of plasmid                         construction, Qiaoyu made a great contribution in the transformation. About the verification of                         the gene, these three members completed the DNA level verification.  Protein detection and                         functional characterization were made by Chengkai and Mingrui. And the strain was used to                         produce yogurt by Yixiao and Chutian. The six members performed their duties and completed the                         construction and functional characterization of our combinatory modules in Lactococcus lactis.
· Modeling
-- In order to predict the cell growth and product formation in our constructed Lactococcus lacti, Minglei and Chutian constructed a mathematical model and used our experimental data to                         evaluate this model so as to understand the principle under the experimental phenomena.                         Human Practice Module.
· Human Practice Module
-- In order to investigating the recent status of liver diseases, Jiajun and Nanting went to                         the First Hospital of Zhejiang Province to consult with clinic doctors, visit patients with                         liver diseases. Chutian went to Zheda Hospital to make a survey about the marketing of                         liver-protective agents. Almost half of our teammates ( Yixiao, Mingrui, Chengkai, Jinyuan,Yixiao and Chutian)                         went to visit several medical Doctors in The First Affiliated Hospital of                         Zhejiang University, and also visited one large yogurt research center in a famous local food                         factory. In order to let more people know about synthetic biology and the iGEM competition,                         Mingrui has made a Wechat public visiting account. And Yixiao and Mingrui handed out                         iGEM-themed West Lake map to tourists from all over the country. Chutian also gave several                         lectures in the community and the 14th high school in Hangzhou to introduce synthetic biology                         and the iGEM competition. To find out whether our research have social value, Chutian designed                         and sent questionnaires to more than thirty companies to investigate the effects of our                         developed project on the future health of human beings.
· Wiki and PPT
-- Jiaqi is responsible of team wiki editing. Jiajun and Nanting take part in the wiki editing.                         Nanting made some photo shooting. Chutian, Qiaoyu and Ke Zhou prepared PPT and will give the                         presentation in Boston.
3. Instructors & Advisors
-- As the advisor of our team, Wezhao gave us valuable advice on project development. As an                         instructor, Zhuwei instructed us a lot on experiment.
