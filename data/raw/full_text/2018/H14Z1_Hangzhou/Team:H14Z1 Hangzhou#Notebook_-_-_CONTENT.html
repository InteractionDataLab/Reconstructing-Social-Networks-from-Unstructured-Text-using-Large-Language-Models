                        1) We heard about the significant competition in synthetic biology - iGEM, and developed a
                        strong
                        interest in participating in this grand competition.
                        2) Then we set up a team in Hangzhou No.14 High School.
                    </P><H6 class="content_sub_subtitle">February</H6><P class="content_context" style="text-align:justify;">
                        1) The team was organized finally and the team members brainstormed the competition project. We
                        used the winter vacation to visit three hospitals to investigate the incurrence rate of liver
                        disease, visit patients and make a survey about how to prevent and treat liver disease.
                    </P><H6 class="content_sub_subtitle">March</H6><P class="content_context" style="text-align:justify;">
                        1) With the suggestions of advisors, we choose to express GSH and SAM in Lactococcus lactis,
                        since both are helpful to protect the liver. And one gene of adhesion factor was considered to
                        increase the retention time of Lactococcus lactis in the intestinal tract of human body.
                        2) Make a trip to the local yogurt research center to study the procedure.
                    </P><H6 class="content_sub_subtitle">April</H6><P class="content_context" style="text-align:justify;">                      1) The plasmids containing the biosynthetic gene (gshF and metK) was constructed respectively,
                        and the expression was carried out in Lactococcus lactis.
                        2) Make a Wechat public account to send out articles regularly.
                        3) Give lecture in the AP center in our campus. Help High school students and community
                        residents learn knowledge about protection and treatment for the liver, and synthetic biology.
                    </P><H6 class="content_sub_subtitle">May</H6><P class="content_context" style="text-align:justify;">
                        1) Two modules of GSH and SAM are connected by Gibson. To achieve tandem expression in
                        Lactococcus lactis. the modules of GSH, SAM and adhesion factor were integrated into the same
                        plasmid (E. coli and Lactococcus lactis shuttle plasmid). The target plasmid was successfully
                        transformed.
                    </P><H6 class="content_sub_subtitle">June</H6><P class="content_context" style="text-align:justify;">
                        1) A number of articles on WeChat public account have been thrown out.
                        2) At the same time, some team members start brainstorming the wiki design. After reading a
                        large number of award-winning wiki, they determine the style and main content of Wiki. Some of
                        the team members are assigned to design some wiki parts.
                        
                        3) Get in touch with the iGEM team of Xiamen University and Shenzhen University to establish a
                        cooperative relationship.
                    </P><H6 class="content_sub_subtitle">July</H6><P class="content_context" style="text-align:justify;">
                        1) The iGEM team of Shenzhen University delivered several strains isolated from a variety of
                        yogurts .
                        2) The contents of GSH and SAM in the culture were detected by HPLC, and the optimization of
                        their production was made. The cell growth curve was also obtained.
                    </P><H6 class="content_sub_subtitle">August</H6><P class="content_context" style="text-align:justify;">
                        1) The effect of adhesion factor was verified by sedimentation experiment.

                        3) We improved the expression of one existing module in the website.
                        4) Help Xiamen University iGEM team measure gene circuits.
                        5) We released our iGEM project in the WeChat-based mini-program created by iGEM team of
                        Shenzhen University.
                    </P><H6 class="content_sub_subtitle">September</H6><P class="content_context" style="text-align:justify;">
                        1) We were supported to utilize the facilities to produce different yogurts in a local company
                        2) Complete most of wiki design work. 
                        3) Optimization of experimental results.
