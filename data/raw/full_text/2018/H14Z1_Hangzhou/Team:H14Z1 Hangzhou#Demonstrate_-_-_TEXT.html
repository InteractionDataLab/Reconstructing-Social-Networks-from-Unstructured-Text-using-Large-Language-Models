Functional validation of GSH module and SAM module by HPLC
To further validate the GSH module and SAM module, we tested the GSH and SAM content in final                         engineered strain L. lactis/pNZ-GMcA.
It is known that L. lactis NZ9000 cannot form GSH and can form little SAM by itself. As shown                         in Figure.1, no GSH was detected in L. lactis NZ9000 as expected. And GSH was obviously                         appeared during the fermentation, illustrating that GSH module was effective. And Figure.2                         showed that more SAM were accumulated in strain L. lactis/pNZ-GMcA than wild-type, illustrating                         the good function of SAM module.

Functional validation of adhesion factor module by self-aggregation                         value assay
To validate adhesion factor module, we carried out self-aggregation assay which could reflect                         the adhesivity of strains. As shown in Figure. 3, by introducing plasmid pNZ-GMcA, L. lactis could have obviously improvement in self-aggregation value, illustrating that adhesion module                         was expressed successfully and worked well.

Functional comparison among different composite modules
After constructing plasmids containing different combination of the three modules, they were                         introduced to L. lactis NZ9000 by electroporation, separately. Then, the function of these                         engineered strains were validated by detected the GSH and SAM content and self-aggregation                         value.

Process demonstrate of smart yogurts with three target modules
After validation of the function of the final engineered strain L. lactis/pNZ-GMcA, we applied                         it to produce smart yogurts. As depicted below, we produced three kinds of smart yogurts. One                         was produced by using wild-type strain L.lactis NZ9000 adding GSH and SAM in the process.                         Another one was produced by using engineered L. lactis/pNZ-GMcA and the last one using                         wild-type strain L.bulgaricus and engineered L. lactis/pNZ-GMcA without adding GSH and SAM.

The content of GSH and SAM in the smart yogurts
The GSH and SAM content of the smart yogurts in the fermentation at 6 and 12 hours were                         detected. As shown in Figure. 6, the smart yogurt made by using engineered L. lactis contained                         obvious more GSH and SAM. The content increased with the increase of cell numbers.

Application of patent for the production of smart yogurts
At last, we have applied a Chinese patent for producing smart yogurts using the engineered                         strain containing three modules. And it was registered by National Patent Office of China.
