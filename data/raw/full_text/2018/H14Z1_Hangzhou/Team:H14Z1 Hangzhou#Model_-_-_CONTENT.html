                        GSH and SAM are becoming more and more popular health care product, and our project focus on
                        producing and accumulating GSH and SAM in <I>L. lactis</I> and improving its adhesivity, and, finally,
                        getting “Smart yoghourt” by using the engineered strain. During our experiments, we have
                        collected some data about cell growth and GSH and SAM production, and then modelled according
                        to the theory kinetics equations. Through these analyses, we wonder a better optimizing
                        strategy to increase both of the production of GSH and SAM in fermentation.
