                        Good health is dependent upon proper liver function. The liver is a huge chemical plant of the
                        human body. It has many major functions as shown in Fig.1. In the daily life, as shown in
                        Fig.2, there are many reasons which overload liver to disease. Liver disease can be divided
                        into viral liver and non viral liver diseases. Non viral liver diseases consist of alcoholic
                        liver, drug or toxic liver disease, metabolic abnormal liver disease, fatty liver, etc.

                        Liver disease is a common disease with great danger. And the incidence rate in East Asia is
                        higher than the average in the world. Scientists have made great efforts to prevent or treat it
                        by hepatitis virus vaccine inoculation, clinic operation, and medicine administration, etc. At
                        present oral administration of two protective drugs (glutathione and S-adenosyl methionine) is
                        very effective against a variety of liver diseases in hospital.

                        Glutathione (GSH) is biosynthesized from glutamic acid, cysteine and glycine, and distributes
                        in many organs in human body, especially in the liver where the highest concentration of GSH
                        exists. GSH plays an important role in liver biochemical metabolism. The liver therapeutical
                        effects of glutathione are listed in the following:

                        S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) is an important intermediate product in liver metabolism. As a
                        methyl donor and a precursor of physiological sulfhydryl compounds, SAM participates in
                        important metabolic reactions in vivo. The liver therapeutical effects of SAM are listed in the

                        Oral administration is the most attractive option for drug delivery due to convenience of
                        administration, patient acceptance, and long-term compliance. However, this strategy is not
                        feasible for many drugs, especially peptide or protein drugs, due to poor biochemical stability
                        (degradation and denaturation) in the harsh gastrointestinal environment (Fig.3) and low
                        epithelial permeability. Synthetic cell therapy is a ﬁeld that has broad potential for future
                        applications in human disease treatment. In vivo synthesis and delivery via cell therapy has
                        several important advantages over traditional oral systemic treatment.

                        <I>Lactococcus lactis</I> is a food-grade bacterium that is widely used in the dairy industry. It is a
                        Gram-positive bacterium and therefore lacks endotoxic lipopolysaccharides (LPS) which are
                        associated with commonly used Gram-negative bacteria. It is also non-invasive and non-commensal
                        and thus has less potential to trigger immunotolerance or side effects upon prolonged use. The
                        bacterium has an established safety profile through its long use in fermented dairy products
                        and is considered as a GRAS (generally recognized as safe) microorganism. During the last two
                        decades, significant advances have been made in the field of <I>lactococcal</I> genetics and protein
                        expression systems. The most commonly used system is the nisin-controlled gene expression
                        (NICE) system, containing the nisin promoter.

                        In the present project, since the oral table administration of GSH and SAM have some
                        disadvantages, such as low stability and short life span, here we tried to develop a novel
                        in-vivo strategy of produce and deliver them simultaneously by using NICE system. In the
                        experiment, two-functional GSH synthetase gene (<I>gshF</I>) and SAM synthetase gene (<I>metK</I>) were in
                        tandem inserted into the expression vector (pNZ8148), and the resulted plasmid (pNZ8148-SG) was
                        employed to construct the target vector pNZ8148-SGC by introducing adhesion factor gene (<I>cwaA</I>).
                        This target vector was transformed to get recombinant <I>Lactococcus lacti</I>, which was employed to
                        produce our “smart yogurt”.
