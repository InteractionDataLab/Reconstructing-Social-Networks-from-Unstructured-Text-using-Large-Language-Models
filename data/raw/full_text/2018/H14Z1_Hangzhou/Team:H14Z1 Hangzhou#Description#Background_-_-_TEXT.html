Liver function and protection
Good health is dependent upon proper liver function. The liver is a huge chemical plant of the                         human body. It has many major functions as shown in Fig.1. In the daily life, as shown in                         Fig.2, there are many reasons which overload liver to disease. Liver disease can be divided                         into viral liver and non viral liver diseases. Non viral liver diseases consist of alcoholic                         liver, drug or toxic liver disease, metabolic abnormal liver disease, fatty liver, etc.

Protection agents
Liver disease is a common disease with great danger. And the incidence rate in East Asia is                         higher than the average in the world. Scientists have made great efforts to prevent or treat it                         by hepatitis virus vaccine inoculation, clinic operation, and medicine administration, etc. At                         present oral administration of two protective drugs (glutathione and S-adenosyl methionine) is                         very effective against a variety of liver diseases in hospital.
Glutathione
Glutathione (GSH) is biosynthesized from glutamic acid, cysteine and glycine, and distributes                         in many organs in human body, especially in the liver where the highest concentration of GSH                         exists. GSH plays an important role in liver biochemical metabolism. The liver therapeutical                         effects of glutathione are listed in the following:
Inhibit the formation of fatty liver.
Directly antagonize the toxicity of oxygen free radicals.
Preventing hepatocyte injury.
Treatment of fulminant hepatic failure caused by drug poisoning.

S-adenosyl methionine
S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) is an important intermediate product in liver metabolism. As a                         methyl donor and a precursor of physiological sulfhydryl compounds, SAM participates in                         important metabolic reactions in vivo. The liver therapeutical effects of SAM are listed in the                         following:
Delay the need for liver transplantation and reduce mortality in patients with                                 alcoholic cirrhosis in a 24-month trial;
Significantly increase hepatic glutathione levels in nonalcoholic liver disease with                                 oral administration of 1200mg SAM daily
Bacterial drug delivery system
Oral administration is the most attractive option for drug delivery due to convenience of                         administration, patient acceptance, and long-term compliance. However, this strategy is not                         feasible for many drugs, especially peptide or protein drugs, due to poor biochemical stability                         (degradation and denaturation) in the harsh gastrointestinal environment (Fig.3) and low                         epithelial permeability. Synthetic cell therapy is a ﬁeld that has broad potential for future                         applications in human disease treatment. In vivo synthesis and delivery via cell therapy has                         several important advantages over traditional oral systemic treatment. First, the required                         dosage of the therapeutic agent is reduced by several orders of magnitude to achieve a                         comparable therapeutic eﬀect. This helps in reducing undesired side eﬀects, both at the site of                         delivery and elsewhere in the body. Second, the route of administration is less invasive than                         intravenous or subcutaneous injection. For example, certain diseases of the gastrointestinal                         tract could be treated, by oral administration of a synthetic bacterium that can traverse to                         the desired location. Third, multiple therapeutic agents can be produced by the same cell                         simultaneously as a combination therapy. Finally, in vivo production and delivery by a                         synthetic chassis provides a more cost-eﬀective treatment as it obviates the need for                         puriﬁcation and formulation of the active compound. In this area, many different agents were                         tried to be synthesized and delivered in-vivo with a variety of microbes (Fig.3).
