                        With the guidance of <B>Dr. Guanchen Liu</B>ï¼Œour team members started to use their facilities
                        to
                        produce yogurt in the bench-top fermentor. Several different yogurts were successfully produced
                        with a variety of strain modes by us.

                        We went to give one seminar for the AP students in our AP center of Hangzhou No. 14 High
                        School. In the seminar, we introduced the common liver diseases, explained the prevention of
                        liver diseases in daily life, and popularized the treatment of liver diseases. Of course, our
                        student leader also introduced our project and 2018 iGEM loudly. Besides, we encouraged the
                        audience to check their body regularly and prevent the incurrence of liver diseases.

                        We have surveyed more than 30 enterprises, including state-owned, private, foreign enterprise

                        produce drugs, food and beverages.

                        Liver is an important metabolic organ in human body. The protection and treatment of liver have
                        always been a hot topic for enterprises. In this survey, more than 70% of enterprises expressed
                        interest in the production and development of liver treatment and protection medicine. However,
                        few enterprises are producing GSH and SAM.

                        According to our surveys, we found that minority enterprises account for most of the market in
                        the production of GSH and SAM no matter in domestic or foreign. Most of them do not produce. In
                        addition to the cause of unconversant, the main problems are difficult product purification,
                        complex production process and then the high cost and low yield.

                        Surveys showed that our program has two advantages that are acknowledged: firstly, the drugs in

                        secondly, the yogurt can serve two purposes for taking in GSH and SAM simultaneously.

                        However, the surveyed companies think that it might be better to add GSH and SAM directly into
                        yogurt and we should pay more attention to instability of engineered bacteria. They suggested
                        that more safety assessment and scientific researches are needed. Even so, most of them
                        consider that our technology is innovative and has willingness or potential willingness to
                        cooperate with us to produce smart yogurts containing GSH and SAM.
