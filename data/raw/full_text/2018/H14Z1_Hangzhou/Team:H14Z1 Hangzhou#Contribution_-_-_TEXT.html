Improved functional characterization of BBa_J04450
Purpose
Previous experiments had shown that BBa_J04450-transformed E.coli BL21(DE3) would turn red                         color under natural light after 18 hours due to leaking expression. This part is useful for                         characterizing the expression of different proteins using the lacI sensitive promoter. For                         better application of this promoter in controlling protein expression, the effects of different                         hosts under various conditions were investigated systematically. The target hosts include E.                         coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli MC1061. The target culture conditions were temperature, inducer                         concentration and medium volume in the flask.
Experiment design
Exploring the effect of temperature on mRFP expression
1. Inoculate 5 ml LB with monocolony (BL21(DE3)/MC1061) from the plate. Grow the cells                         overnight at 37 ℃，200 rpm.
2. Dilute pre-culture 1:100 into 5ml LB (BL21(DE3)/MC1061) and cultivate at different                         temperature (26, 30, 34, 37 ℃), 200 rpm, respectively.
3. Measure the fluorescence and OD600 every 4 hours.
Exploring the effect of medium volume on mRFP expression
1. Inoculate 5 ml LB with monocolony (BL21/MC1061) from the plate.Grow the cells overnight at                         37 ℃, 200 rpm.
2. Dilute pre-culture 1:100 into 30ml, 50ml, 70ml LB (BL21(DE3)/MC1061) and cultivate at 37 ℃,                         200 rpm.
3. Measure the fluorescence and OD600 every 2 hours.
Exploring the effect of concentration of IPTG on mRFP expression
1. Inoculate 5 ml LB with monocolony(BL21(DE3)/MC1061) from the plate. Grow the cells overnight                         at 37 ℃, 200 rpm.
2. Dilute pre-culture 1:100 into 5ml LB (BL21(DE3)/MC1061), cultivate at 37 ℃, 200 rpm. Protein                         expression are induced using 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0 mM IPTG, respectively.
3. Measure the fluorescence and OD600 every 4 hours.
Results
Exploring the effect of concentration of IPTG on mRFP expression
There are some differences of growth rate at different temperatures for both E. coli strains                         (BL21(DE3), MC1061) (Fig.1). However, the differences of the fluorescence intensity at                         different temperature is much higher than those of the growth rate at various temperatures by                         using two E. coli cells (Fig 2).

Effects of medium volume on mRFP expression
The mRFP expression of two strains showed the same trend in different volume of medium in the                         flask. After 6 hours, the fluorescence intensity in 30 ml medium-containing flask is                         significantly higher than others, indicating that mRFP express fastest in this volume scale                         (Fig 3). This suggest that dissolved oxygen is an important factor which will affect the                         protein expressin and cell growth, since the lower medium volume in the same type flask will                         bring about higher level of dissolved oxygen in the medium.

Effects of IPTG concentration on mRFP expression
Our results showed that significant fluorescence differences were not observed by using                         different IPTG induction (Fig 3). However, it is interesting that the fluorescence intensity of                         BL21(DE3) after IPTG induction are higher than those of MC1061, not similar to the trend in our                         previous experiment (Fig 2). It might be explained that the expression of mRFP can be                         accelerated by IPTG inductin in BL21(DE3) with regard to other E. coli hosts.
