Title
Smart Yogurt：A possible alternative supply of two liver-protective factors with                     colonization-prone Lactococcus lactisa
Abstract
A variety of liver diseases occur throughout the world irrespective of age, sex, region or                     race. Two important liver-protective factors (glutathione and S-adenosyl methionine) has been                     applied to prevent and treat many different liver diseases and damage. Due to low stability and                     short half-life, oral table supply of GSH or SAM might be replaced by a novel strategy of                     supplying these molecules continuously using our synthetic biology design of smart yogurt. In                     the experiment, two-functional GSH synthetase gene (gshF) and SAM synthetase gene (metK) were                     in tandem inserted into the expression vector (pNZ8148), and the resulted plasmid (pNZ-GM) was                     further employed to construct the target vector pNZ-GMcA by introducing adhesion factor gene                     (cwaA). This target vector was confirmed by gene sequencing and transformed into food-grade Lactococcus lactis. Further studies showed that the synthetic levels of SAM and GSH were                     improved greatly with Lactococcus lactis NZ9000/pNZ-GMcA, and the colonization-prone ability                     was also increased simultaneously. Finally, this recombinant Lactococcus lactis was inoculated                     to produce our smart yogurt separately or combined with Lactobacillus delbruecki. The present                     work paved one road to supply liver-protective agents using smart yogurt concept thanks to                     synthetic biology.
