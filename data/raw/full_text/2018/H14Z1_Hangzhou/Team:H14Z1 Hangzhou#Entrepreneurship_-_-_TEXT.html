Entrepreneurship
A variety of liver diseases occur throughout the world. Glutathione (GSH) and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) have been applied to prevent and treat a variety of liver diseases. In the project we created the new concept of “smart yogurt” by engineering the food-grade Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 with the composite modules, including the syntheses of GSH, SAM and adhesion factor A. Our smart products not only have much higher contents of SAM and GSH, but also hold high-density of colonization-prone cells for potential biosynthesis of these two liver-protective factors in our gastrointestinal tracts. Due to the advantages over commercial yogurts in the daily life, our smart yogurt technology attracts several pharmaceutical companies to sponsor our iGEM team for this competition. Then we applied one Chinese invention patent (App No. 2018111840951) to protect it. With further efforts in social activities, our smart yogurt project will have an increasing commercial potential in industry.
