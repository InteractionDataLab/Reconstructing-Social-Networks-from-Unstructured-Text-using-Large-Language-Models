Parts
TUST-iGEM 2018 team members are committed to the establishment of a wide range of diverse parts library. We have constructed a detection and degradation system for tetracycline and data and phenomena demonstrate that they are valid.
We use the Gibson assembly method to build our parts. This way we were able to generate our required parts in a fast and efficient way. Therefore, all of the parts we used are composite. The different basic parts comprising the composite parts are documented seperately, although they do not exist induvidually.
In the case of a constitutive expression, the promoter is included in the biobrick itself. For the inducible expression, we made use of a plasmid backbone containing a Tet-promoter ，a Lac-promoter and the LacI gene, which encodes for the Lac repressor. And we improve both the function and characterization of the some part to better express in our constructive chasis.

COMPOSITE PARTS
We use the Gibson assembly method to build our parts. This way we were able to generate our required parts in a fast and efficient way. Therefore, all of the parts we used are composite.

BASIC PARTS
The different basic parts comprising the synthesized parts we used are documented here. Please note that some of these parts do not exist individually. And we improve both the function and characterization of the some part to better express in our constructive chasis.
