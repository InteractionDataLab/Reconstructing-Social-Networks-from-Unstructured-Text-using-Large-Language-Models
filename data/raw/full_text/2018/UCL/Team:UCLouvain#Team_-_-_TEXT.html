About us
For the 2018 edition, it will be the third time when the UCLouvain participates, representing the only Belgian university to the competition! To meet the challenge, we decided to establish a great team compound of medical students, civil         engineers, bioengineers, biologists and IT specialists. Although we come from diverse faculties, we consider the differences of skills as a real added value and we have all something to say around the table. The responsibilities were         attributed according to our expertise and to our preferences.
During this adventure, we realized various enriching collaborations in particular a conference to the European Parliament including several other teams. Furthermore, to reach a bigger impact with our project, we were brought to meet various         leading players in particular in the field of resistance in antibiotics.
In a few words : “It is a great experience with great people”.
