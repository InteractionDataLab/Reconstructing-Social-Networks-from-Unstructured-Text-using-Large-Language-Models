We also had a discussion with Dr. Chris Myers about his research in genetic circuits. He brought up the importance of modularity in Synthetic Biology, which further encouraged us to change the direction of our project.

Our RFP, GFP and Intein Passenger plasmids were transformed into E. Coli BL21 for expression. As seen in the photo below, the expression was successful. They were induced with 400 μM IPTG when OD reached 0.6. Expression was done overnight at 25˚C and 37˚C to test for optimal conditions. Some of our 50 ml LB overnight cultures were contaminated and had to be repeated. Fluorescence was measured using our BMG plate reader.
The cells were sonicated, and the proteins purified and run on an SDS gel.
As the Intein Passenger is ready we can start cloning in our nickel binding peptide (NikR) and our estrogen binding peptide (ER). We first amplified them through PCR, as seen on the first gel. Another attempt of GFP cloning gave the second gel; it looks like GFP2C1 (colony 1) could have worked.
To compare our improved mScarlet-intein BBa_K2842669 construct to Heidelberg’s 2014 RFP-intein construct BBa_K1362101, we cloned their construct into BL21 cells.
