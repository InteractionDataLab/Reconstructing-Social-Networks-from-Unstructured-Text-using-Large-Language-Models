He is a part time pianist and full time genius.  Shaheer is a key member of the group, team leader and the one who took up the challenge of starting the first ever Highschool iGEM team from Pakistan. His contributions in the lab were very important for our project. Also known for giving off these Einstein vibes (messy hair and twinkly eyes) he was in the list of Forbes 30 under 30 class of 2018.
One of the team leaders of group and the person responsible for keeping it all together. He loves debating so much you will always catch him debating. A student of LACAS, Marsad takes deep interest in molecular biology, psychology and an evolved democracy.
Rubba Khokar, yeah you heard that right. This little human has Khokar blood in her. You can find her crying after her test claiming it went really bad, but don't make the mistake of trying to comfort her because it'll be her comforting you after she gets an A* and you yourself end up failing. She has contributed blood, sweat, and especially tears to our SynBio cause.
Khadija's hobbies include filmography and photography. She also has this exceptional ability to figure out riddles and solve puzzles, which are some of the things required to be a brilliant detective. Also her love of memes is unparalleled.
Don't let Khadija Sakhawat's kind eyes and height fool you; you don't want to mess with her. However, she loves science and more so, her friends. She's got a 'lit' music playlist, and oh, she's really into cute aethetic stationary items for some reasons.
Alishba is determined to make a difference, that ís why she studies hard and raises awareness for mental health. She worked hard in the lab all summer long and hopes that our team wins something. Also she loves pets and hopes to one day own a very animal friendly zoo.
Shaheer Akhtar isn't only our school's Head Boy, he also happens to be the best guitarist I know. His love of reading philosophy has shaped him into a humanitarian person who doesn't say no to anyone. He is waiting for the day his parents allow him to cycle to school (It is a long distance with no cycling path).
Soha loves robotics, reading and music in that order. She is fluent in sarcasm and wants to own a robot factory in the near future. A huge Harry Potter fan, she is hoping to make ëmagicí possible by her work on machinery in the future.
Rafay takes great interest in human philosophy and politics and studies these topics in detail. He likes sports of all sorts. He is also inspired by Allamah Iqbal (Pakistan's national poet) poetry and hopes to one day start a revolt inspired by his poems.
Sohaib loves sports. He loves volleyball and basketball. When he isn't slam dunking or winning points in volleyball. However, he is being a role model student. He also loves sleep almost as much as he loves sports.
Saqlain
When Saqlain isn't wooing people with his melodious voice, he is working hard in the lab, isolating DNA and creating slides. He is a student of LACAS by day and a world renowned singer by night.
Moosa is the kindest 18 year old you'll meet. He has contributed a lot to the SynBio workshop by providing our audience with delicious samosas at the right time. He specializes in being friendzoned.
Mahad's interest in biology is great, and he's very passionate about this competition and has worked hard in the lab. He may seem very innocent to look at but there be more there than it seems to the eye.
