Model
By the model we built, the feasibility proof of our project is provided and a diagnostic criteria for this testing is designed.
Experiments
We successfully transformed plasimids into previously screened Saccharomyces cerevisiae to construct modified yeast. Further test has been carried out to prove the function of modified yeast as histamine detector.
Hardware
We have run two vital testing to ensure the hardware can actually measure OD value and the fluorescence intensity of the sample and do the diagnosis automatically.
Human Practice
After doing a questionnaire survey and consulting the clinic doctors of allergy department, we figured out the stockholders of our projects and knew that there are indeed demands on convenient allergy testing device.
