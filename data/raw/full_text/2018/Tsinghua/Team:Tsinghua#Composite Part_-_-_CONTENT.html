Therefore dCas9/gRNA complex is able to inhibit expression without damaging DNA. As dCas9 is detrimental to the growth of bacteria, we put it after promoter J23114 with B0030 to make sure that dCas9 will be expressed at a constant level with minimal side effect on bacterial growth. </TD></TR><TR><TD>[2]</TD><TD><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2558202">BBa_K2558202</A></TD><TD>lacI-regulated, lambda pL hybrid promotor test device</TD><TD>This part contains constantly expressed lacI, and plac-controlled sfGFP as our reporter.

Without AHL stimulation, the lux pR-HS promotor is repressed by the dCas9-gRNA expressed by Safety Catch system. Therefore, the luxI and GFP cannot be expressed. Upon the stimulation of AHL, the CRISPRi system in Safety Catch is inhibited, thus the lux pR-HS promotor is exposed, and then luxR-AHL complex can now bind to and activate lux pR-HS promotor. Therefore, luxI and GFP can now be expressed. Besides, this system will keep producing more luxI-AHL, which will form a positive feedback and increase the expression of GFP.

Upon the addition of AHL, lacI on Safety Catch is transcribed (here we need to mention that even though the lacI on the Safety Catch is also controlled by lux pR, the design of gRNA allows us to make it unaffected by CRISPRi, thus it can still be activated by the luxR-AHL complex.) and prevents gRNA synthesis, thus relieving inhibition on lux positive feedback system on Neon.
