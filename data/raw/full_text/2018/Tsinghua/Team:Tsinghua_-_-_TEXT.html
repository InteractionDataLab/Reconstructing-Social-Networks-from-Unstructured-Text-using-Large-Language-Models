Abstract
NEON COLI - WIDE-DYNAMIC-RANGE, FINE-TUNED QUORUM SENSING POSITIVE FEEDBACK CIRCUIT
Neon Coli is an acronym of our slogan: Necessary Expression ONly! What we built is a controllable positive feedback device. We combined the lux quorum sensing system from Vibrio Fischeri with CRISPRi to design our own NEON system. NEON system is a great improvement to preexisting artificial positive feedback devices. It has the advantages of positive feedback loops—sensitive, extraordinarily high output and wide-dynamic-range. It can also avoid their shortages of uncontrollable leakage. We built this device with the initial intention to control a leaky generator. However with the help of other iGEMer we realized the potential of our NEON system. NEON system can be integrated into other iGEM projects as expression optimizer and assist in signal transduction processes. It may also lead to new applications in synthetic biological computations, and circuits that require fine control of gene expression.
