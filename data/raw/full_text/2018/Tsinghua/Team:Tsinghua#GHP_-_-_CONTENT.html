This year we went to Changsha Yali High School, Hunan, where the 27th China High School Biology Olympiad was being held. Also we prepared synthetic biology lectures for students at the Tsinghua summer school. By introducing iGEM and our project, we hope to attract more young masterminds to the field of synthetic biology.
              
           
                  
              As we aim to expand our public education program, we held a conference with members in the conjoint Chinese-International teaching assistance programs, discussing how we were going to help communicate the idea of science and biology to those students in economically and educationally underdeveloped area in China.
                        As an active member of the community, Tsinghua is well engaged in meeting and sharing with other universities and iGEM teams. We attended the annual meetup held at Beijing Normal University at the beginning of this year, sharing our experiences. Our presentation was awarded with the First Prize. In summer, we shared the history of our iGEM projects with students from USTC.
               At the end of August, Tsinghua attended the 5th CCiC hosted by Shanghai Tech. CCiC, the biggest iGEMer community in China, provided us with a great opportunity to establish new friendships and renew old ones. We received much help from other teams in many ways. Team Peking, in particular, generously shared a new transformation technique. Also in September, we attended a regional meet up held by UCAS, through which we laid the foundation for further collaborations among iGEM teams in Beijing and Tianjin.                 
              
              
              
             During the Chinese national holiday, Tsinghua and Tsinghua-A team held an exhibition on synthetic biology at Chinese Science and Technology Museum (CSTM). By introducing visitors to microorganisms and microscopes we gave them a basic understanding of microbiology. We provided graphs of bacteria for children and encouraged them to design their own bacteria. We even provided florescent bacteria with GFP, RFP and YFP plasmids for children to draw on LB plates. Later we sent the pictures of their bacterial painting back. We also talked about the mechanism of allergy which is closely related to Tsinghua-A's project. Members from both teams had a great time and we are looking forward to further collaborations.              </SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><FOOTER class="bg-light"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-4"><SPAN class="copyright">Copyright Â© Tsinghua iGEM 2018</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
