Dr. Chen set up the BioLab in Mingdao since 2014 and led a team beginning iGEM then. In 2016, the School officially announced Mingdao High School BioLab facility for genetic engineering, molecular biology and iGEM. We as students are very luck in Mingdao High School having course and competition for synthetic biology study.
