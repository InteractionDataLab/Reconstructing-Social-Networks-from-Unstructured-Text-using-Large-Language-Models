Dr. Pei-Hong CHEN
Michael's working attitude is a nice blend of robot ethos, self-abandonment and relentlessness. Fueled by energy drinks and snacks from the sushi bar he dissects problems with chirurgic precision in no time. He more than once saved our models and algorithms from memory leaks, division errors and underflows. As he is probably the mathematically and programatically most gifted dude in the galaxy, it is not surprising that he doesn’t find it problematic to “just write your custom CUDA ops” or to work on state calculations in supraconductors besides his BSc in Physics and MSc in Bioinformatics.
