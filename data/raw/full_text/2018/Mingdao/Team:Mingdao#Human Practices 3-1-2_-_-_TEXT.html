Description
Taiwan Lourdes Association
Interview: a HIV/AIDS social worker Date: Aug. 22, 2018 Location: Lourdes association office in Taichung Reflection: patient care, dignity and privacy
Lourdes association is a place that provides many aspects of services for AIDS patients, such as health, medical, occupation and interpersonal relationship. They offer places for AIDS patients that are in need to stay temporarily by establishing midway houses in Taipei and Taichung and aid them to return to their origin life. Why: We want to understand how a social work can give to HIV patients and realize the life and difficulties one could meet with HIV infection.
How: A talk with a professional AIDS social worker What:
We went to Lourdes association to discuss our project with a social worker. The association can give the HIV patients a temporary home in order to enable them to connect with the society. The patients could return to their origin community as long as they have a stable job and take medicine regularly. We asked the social worker we want the HIV patients to be involved in our interview and survey. Unfortunately, the patients stayed here always felt illness because of the chronic disease. It is not convenient and comfortable for them to be interviewed publicly. Moreover, the association has to protect their privacy, since the public still has some prejudice against them. Reflection:
As for the blood testing methods we provided, the HIV social workers think the point-of-care system is great under an anonymous way. In addition, the product we designed is suitable for suspects with possible HIV infection in a limited-resource region like some areas in African. After today’s visit, we realized that to provide service for HIV patients as a social work requires amounts of time, patience and sufficient knowledge. Most importantly, the concerns about the privacy issues should be taken cared of for HIV patients. Therefore, we think the best way is to modify our questionnaire and inquire their opinion anonymously.
