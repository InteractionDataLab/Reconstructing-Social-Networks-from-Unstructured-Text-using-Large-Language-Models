Experiment
↓Aedes aegypti
↓10% glucose water with or without heat-killed E. coli (109 cells/ml)
↓gDNA extracted at 0, 6, 18 hours after feeding
↓2 repeats for every group & one control of gDNA of E. coli
↓PCR with specific primer for A. aegypti or E. coli
Primers
•Aedes: (730 bp)
    -Act-2F (5′-ATGGTCGGYATGGGNCAGAAGGACTC-3′),
    -Act-2R (5′-TCGCACTTCATGATSGAGTTGTA-3′)
•E. coil: (970 bp)
    -K12IS-L (5’-CGCGATGGAAGATGCTCTGTA-3’)
    -K12-R (5’-ATCCTGCGCACCAATCAACAA-3’)
Result
Genomic DNAs of Aedes aegypti were confirmed by PCR with Aedes primers in all groups, indicating the integrity of the extracted DNA. Feeding heat-killed bacteria to the mosquitoes, genomic DNAs of E. coli can be detected in the group at 6hr post-feeding and slightly decreased at 18hr post-feeding, demonstrating the existence of non-dividing bacteria at least within overnight in the gut of a mosquito.

GFP System
To create a reporter system, we constructed a GFP expression vector. We amplified a constitutive promoter from Drosophila actin 5c gene and an eukaryotic poly A signal by PCR from pAc5.1 vector. The resulting DNA fragments were assembled with a BioBrick existing part of GFP to generate the reporter vector of Ac5- GFP-polyA / pSB1C3 (K2543004).
To test the reporter system, we cultured a mosquito Aedes albopictus C6/36 cell line and transfected cells with the plasmid of Ac5-GFP-polyA. GFP positive cells and intensity were analyzed 2 days after transfection.
EXPERIMENT
↓C6/36 cells (1.8 x 105 cells/well in a 96-well plate)
↓Liposome-mediated transfection and culture for 2 more days
↓Read fluorescence intensity at Ex/Em = 480/520 nm with a microplate reader
↓Observe GFP+ cells under a fluorescence microscope
RESULT
As data shown here, Ac5 is a strong and constitutive promoters which can drive GFP to high expression level in mosquito cells. And we can transfect more than 50% of GFP positive cell with liposome-mediated DNA delivery.
Mosquito Immune Signaling
Mosquito immune defense signaling involves well-studied and well-known Toll and Imd intracellular pathways to trigger antimicrobial peptide (AMP) production. Gram-positive bacteria induce Toll signaling, while Gram-negative bacteria induce Imd signaling. However, some promoters may be activated in a synergistic and cross-talk way. Even though Mosquito-borne viruses are controlled by immune signaling in mosquitoes in a currently unidentified pathway, AMP promoter activities were enhanced in mosquito cells in the presence of the viruses.

Rudian Zhang, et al.
EXPERIMENT
↓Aag2 cell line from Aedes aegypti
↓E. coli or Bacillus at OD600 = 0.05 (≅ MOT = 10)
↓RNA extracted 12 hours after bacteria challenge
↓qRT-PCR with specific AMP primers
RESULT
AMP promoters can be activated by challenging with Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, some are regulated synergistically by cross-talking Toll and Imd pathways.

AMP System
Aedes aegypti, a yellow fever mosquito, is a major arbovirus vector to transmit several diseases and spread mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue virus, Ziki virus, yellow fever viruses, etc. It can be genetically modified to control viral transmission. The cell line isolated from Aedes are widely used in the research. The full genome sequence and signaling pathways are defined in the literature. Therefore, it a good host for our study. In our project, we successfully cloned 3 AMP (GAM1, CecN, DefA) promoters from gDNA of Aedes aegypty and confirmed the sequencesby sequences by sequencing.
AMP promoters amplified by PCR
To create AMP reporter system, the AMP promoters of Aedes aegypti amplified from PCR were assembled with GFP-polyA /pSB1C3 (BBa_K2543003)
To test the function of the device, C6/36 cells were transfected with the vectors. And the mosquito cells were challenged with bacteria on 2 days after transfection.
EXPERIMENT
↓C6/36 cells were seeded at the density of 1.8 x 105 cell/well in a 96-well plate
↓Cells were transfected with the AMP-GFP-polyA vectors
↓E. coli was added on 2 days post-transfection at MOI=10
↓GFP positive cells and intensity were analyzed by a fluorescence microscope and a microplate reader at Ex/Em =                 480/520 nm,respectively
GAM1-GFP-polyA / pSB1C3 challenged with E. coli
GAM1/CecN/DefA-GFP-polyA / pSB1C3 challenged with E. coli
RESULT
We successfully assembled three AMP promoters with GFP and poly A to pSB1C3 vector. The function of the devices were tested by challenging with E. coli. The intensities were 5.31-fold, 3.02-fold and 2.29-fold increase for E. coli-induced GAM1, CecN and DefA promoter activities, respectively. The GFP positive cells after induction were clearly observed under fluorescence microscope.
To test the AMP promoter in response of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, we challenged GAM1 promoter with E. coli and Bacillus subtilis, respectively.
EXPERIMENT
↓C6/36 cells were seeded at the density of 1.8 x 105 cell/well in a 96-well plate
↓Cells were transfected with the GAM1-GFP-polyA vector
↓E. coli or B. subtilis was added on 2 days post-transfection at MOI=10
↓GFP intensity was measured by a microplate reader at Ex/Em =                480/520 nm.
RESULT
The data represented in C6/36 cells showed that GAM1 promoter was not only activated by Gram-negative E. coli but also induced by Gram-positive B. subtilis. The result further indicated the AMP promoter activity may cross talk between Toll and Imd signaling pathways.
GAM1-GFP-polyA / pSB1C3 challenged with E. coli & B. subtilis
To apply GAM1 promoter as a biosensor, E. coli at various concentrations were added to the mosquito cells transfected with the GAM1-GFP-polyA / pSB1C3
EXPERIMENT
↓C6/36 cells were seeded at the density of 1.8 x 105 cell/well in a 96-well plate
↓Cells were transfected with GAM1-GFP-polyA or Ac5-GFP-polyA vectors
↓E. coli at MOI=2, 4, 8, 16, 32 were added on 2 days post-transfection
↓GFP intensity was measured by a microplate reader at Ex/Em = 480/520 nm.
RESULT
As figures shown below, the green fluorescence intensities driven by GAM1 promoter were increased dose-dependently in the presence of E. coli at MOIs from 2 to 32. The fluorescence expressed by Ac5 promoter was not influenced at the same condition. These results demonstrated GAM1-GFP reporter system can used in the mosquito cells as a biosensor in response of different concentrations of bacteria.
GAM1 promoter was dose-dependently induced by heat-killed E. coli
Ac5 promoter was not affected by heat-killed E. coli
