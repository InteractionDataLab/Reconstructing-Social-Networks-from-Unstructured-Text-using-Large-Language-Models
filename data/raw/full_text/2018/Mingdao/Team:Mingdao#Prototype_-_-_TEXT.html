Product Design
So now that the experiments are proven successful, it’s time to take the mosquitoes out for a spin. But we wouldn’t want the mosquitoes flying around spreading diseases. And that’s where the prototype comes in.  Our cage-bandage consists of three parts. The first part is a transparent top for observing the mosquitoes. The second part is a fine metal web, sort of like a screen window. The mosquitoes can draw blood through the holes, but can’t wriggle through it. The final part is the bandage, for sticking the device onto skin.

Transparent Window Allows Observation
     
The device is no larger than a matchbox, so it is light enough to be carried in hundreds on a drone. Yet, the box is still large enough to hold more than 20 mosquitoes. The drone would be equipped with a UV light bulb to read the results. The results would then be uploaded to a hard-drive in a world wide database.
Smaller Than a Matchbox
     
There have been people who ask, what happens if a mosquito escape? Well, we have an easy solution. We simple have to pluck off the wings. It can stop the mosquitoes to spread quickly because mosquitoes are terrible at crawling.
