Description
Mosquito Toll-Amp signaling plays an important roll in response to and regulating blood infectious pathogens.
To genetically engineer mosquitoes as blood testing tools, we’ve collected DNA materials as BioBrick parts for future assembly.
First, we designed a universal pathogen blood testing kit consisting of BioBrick parts of GAM1 promoter, GFP and polyA, as well as Ac5 promoter as a positive expression control.
Second, we designed a HIV viral blood testing kit consisting of BioBrick parts of Ac5 promoter, CD4 extracellular domain, Drosophila transmembrane and intracellular domains, and poly A, as well as Ac5-GFP-polyA as a positive expression control.
