Description
International Volunteers in Africa
Interview: student volunteers Date: Aug. 3, 2018 Location: International Department of Mingdao High School Reflection: limited resources, diseases Why: To understand the situation and health problem in Africa
How: We interviewed the international volunteers in Mingdao High School who went to Africa Tanzania for twenty days to help them with education, environmental sanitation, personal hygiene, accompany, and interflow. What:
They told us about what they’ve heard, what they’ve seen and what they’ve feel through their experience. Here are the arrangement our reporter said: Although I have known that in Africa there are still rich people, before the interview, my impressions of Africa are no roads, simple houses, people usually travel on foot, and bad sanitation system. After the interview and some outside chatting with the interviewees, I have a more complete view of Africa. Even though the country, Tanzania, the interviewees went is a comparatively more developed country in Africa, the interviewees have shared that when they took out the donated materials, the kids look excited and seems like they have never seen them before, especially for soaps. The interviewees also depicted that the children will show off their long, new pencils to others since they always used the pencil to less than 5 cm long, which impressed me a lot. The interviewees said that after volunteering in Tanzania, they won’t describe Africa as dirty or having bad sanitation system, but primeval. In fact, there are only one long alphalet road in Tanzania. Only a few people have private vehicle and oxcart as well as carriage still can often been seen on the street as public transportation. An interesting fact the interviewees shared is that the mosquitoes at there are slow and are not afraid of people. Also, the locals don’t have the concept of protecting oneself from mosquito bite. In conclusion, most African regions are less developed with locals lacking complete health education. At last, please noted that this conclusion is not the representative of whole Africa. Reflection:
Through discussing, we knew about the concepts of Africans’ common opinions about mosquitos. It’s important to our project because this data affect the probabilities we will succeed in that region. Fortunately, since most of them don’t afraid of mosquitos, our project seem to be implementable!
