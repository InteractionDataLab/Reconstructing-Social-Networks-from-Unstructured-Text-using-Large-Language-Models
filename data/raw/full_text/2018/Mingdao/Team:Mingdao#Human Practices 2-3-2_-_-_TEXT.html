Description
Application in Livestock
Interview: Prof. Wu-Chun Tu Date: Sep. 23, 2018 Location: National Mosquito-Borne Diseases Control Research Center, NHRI Reflection: Ethical issue, technical problem
Why: To understand the application and technical problems of our project design
How: We interviewed Dr. Wu-Chun Tu, a professor working in the Department of Entomology, National Chung Hsing University, who has published more than dozens of articles in SCI journals. He is also serving in National Mosquito-Borne Diseases Control Research Center, National Health Research Institutes for the government to control mosquito-borne diseases. In our conversation, he gave us quite a lot suggestions and indicated the direction of our project in the future. What:
In our conversation, the professor told us that the greatest disadvantage of our mosquito-based blood testing system to detect pathogens is the lack of specificity. Also, he indicated that applying the system to human body could still be too far away. Even providing it to African people, it is impossible for the authority to pass the related legislations, which involves in many moral issues and a sense of discrimination. After all, why are they but not others tested? The professor suggested we could design a device which can be applied to everyone instead of special communities. He suggested that it’s better for us to apply our design to livestock. By decreasing the animal infectious diseases, it could reduce the zoonotic pathogen to people. Reflection:
Due to so many limitations, it is currently impossible for us to release GE mosquitoes to the environment. In the conversation, we found that we don’t fully understand mosquitoes as our experimental host. We still need to learn more about the experiment using mosquitoes and the application of GE organisms in a safety and moral way.
