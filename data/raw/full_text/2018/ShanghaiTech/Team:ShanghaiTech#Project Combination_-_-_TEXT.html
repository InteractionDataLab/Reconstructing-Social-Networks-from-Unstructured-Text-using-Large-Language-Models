The result of the combination of our negative feedback loop and orthogonal ribosome is as described below. When the input signal comes, it will be processed by our negative feedback loop and the translation of orthogonal ribosome will be initiated. Through precise processing by the negative feedback loop, the output, shown as the instantaneous expression quantity of the orthogonal ribosome, will be highly similar to the input signal. The orthogonal ribosome will then combine with specific RNA sequence named orthogonal RBS, and hence initiate the expression of our target protein, which will be translated with the same instantaneous expression quantity as the orthogonal ribosome owns.
Through the optimization and analysis of our model, we have proved that the expression of orthogonal ribosome regulated by the negative feedback loop, which is introduced for avoiding resource competition, does not have any negative influence on the signal retaining efficiency of the whole loop.

Hence our system not only retained the frequency given by the input, but also greatly reduced the severity of resource competition in bacteria, leading to a high fidelity expression system with fast response to the appearance of the input signal.
Base on the prediction of the complete system, we are seriously considering the applications in medical, diagnostic, environmental monitoring and other fields.
