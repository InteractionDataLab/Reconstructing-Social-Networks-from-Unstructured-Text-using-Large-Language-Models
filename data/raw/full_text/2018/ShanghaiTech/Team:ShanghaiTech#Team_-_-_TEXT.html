Meet Our Team Attribution
Team
There was an idea, to bring together a group of remarkable students, to see if we could become something more. Seventeen students from information science, material science and life science academy responded to the call.
As a paragon model of interdisciplinary integration, each member participates as an essential part in our team, the spark of inspiration glittered along the way.

Favorite bioexperiment: As a basic biochemist with speciality in signal transduction, my favorite bioexperiments are mass spectrometry and western blotting analysis. Mass spectrometry has the power to reveal variety of post-translational modifications on protein with interest, including phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination；with the help of great antibodies, all these novel findings could be further validated with western blotting analysis.
Brief description of your iGEM journey: It’s amazing. I am amazed by my fantastic colleague (Co-PI), who provides sincere help in every step of the journey for the success of the whole team. I am amazed by my undergraduate teammates, who exhibit tremendous capapility, responsibility and persistence during the course of the project. I am amazed by the global influential power of the iGEM, and am very proud of myself as part of it in 2018 competition event.
