Overview
Science and life. The advance of science including synthetic biology cannot digress from people's daily life. And   laboratory creations always aim at bettering the world. What iGEM team ShanghaiTech wants to achieve this   year is to bridge the distance between science and the public. Through education and institutions visit, we   try to find the approach to build a direct relationship between laboratory and society. Through colorful   design in biosafety education, we help students achieve the transition from a green hand to a qualified   member of biological researches. Through communication with experts, we seek more possibilities in our   project for both laboratory-use and social-use.
