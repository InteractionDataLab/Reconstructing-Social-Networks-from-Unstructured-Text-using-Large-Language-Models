CCiC
Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) is one of the biggest synthetic biology conferences for all iGEM teams in China. With its rapid development, nowadays CCiC has grown into a mature medium for scientific leaders to pass on advanced knowledge to the upcoming successors. This year, we were proudly to be the host of the fifth CCiC, gathering 63 iGEM teams and more than 500 participants in ShanghaiTech University.
Themed “Among us, past, present and future meet” , the fifth CCiC aimed to gather present and past iGEMer to share experience and memory about participating iGEM as well as knowledge people learned from iGEM. We were looking forward to providing a platform for iGEMer or people who are interested in iGEM and synthesis biology to communicate and exchange their mind. The conference was held from August 28th to August 31st. We were honored to invite members of iGEM headquarters, Meagan Lizarazo and Richard Johnson to attend our conference and deliver interesting lectures.
During the four-day conference, we organized team presentation and poster session for iGEM teams to present their work, providing participants with precious opportunities to improve collaboration and learn from each other. To make sure that each team could get helpful feedback for the last month’s preparation for the Giant Jamboree, we invited present iGEMers to judge each team’s presentation and poster as well as experienced past iGEMers to host panel session. Every team that participated in the fifth CCiC had chances to receive instructions and give suggestions.
Besides, according to elaborate voting for special events, we held special events such as trouble-shooting which focused on problems solving for various parts of iGEM project and After-iGEM show where teams present relevant artwork, books, software, business or academic achievements derived from iGEM. We believed that these events are meaningful to continuously spread the enthusiasm of participating iGEM.
Six months of preparation, four days of synthetic biology party. Our team received numerous of appreciation from other teams. There is no doubt that the fifth CCiC became a part of the best memory of our 2018 iGEM journey and a perfect place for all teams to build collaboration and friendship.

This year we collaborated with NCHU_Taichung iGEM team in human practice part. NCHU team want to use eco-friendly biological process to remove dioxin which is a group of toxic chemical compounds and harmful to the environment. They had found a company in Shanghai called “Dajing”, which is relevant to their project. So we helped them to interview the manager of Dajing Company, collected suggestions on their project and answers for their question.
During our visit to Dajing Biotechnology Company, the manager emphasized the significance of NCHU’s project and introduced us how Dajing deals with the similar toxic chemical compounds from an industrial perspective. Besides, he provided useful advice as well as detailed answers to the questions that NCHU team asked.
After the visit, we collected interview materials and sent to the NCHU team. They followed some advice from the interview materials and improved their project.

In September, we helped Jilin_China iGEM team to test ten of their plasmids in the cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) system. The goal for Jilin_China this year is to build a collection of RNA-based thermosensors. After achieving data in vivo, they wanted to test the ability of their thermosensors in CFPS system to gain better expression results with less noise interruption. With better equipment and well-experienced crew members in our lab, we helped them do the measurement and obtained fantastic experimental results for their thermosensors in vitro.
Ten plasmids sent to us were expressed in vitro under three temperature conditions: 29°C, 37°C and 42°C. Using microplate reader, we read the relative fluorescence intensity of each group of expressed protein, and received protein expression quantity under each temperature conditions for each plasmid according to the standard curve of concentration-fluorescence intensity. Eventually, we drew the relative fluorescence intensity-temperature plots of different plasmids, and the protein expression quantity-temperature plots of different plasmids. According to these data, we concluded that these ten plasmids have a relatively good expressing condition in vitro. With the rising of environment temperature, some of these plasmids showed the elevated protein expression level as expected.
