During our meeting with him, we learned about the possible future implications of iPS cell technology and the development of this new industry in the context of Japanese regulations. We were inspired by his work and wanted to know how we could also contribute to this field of research. The talk with him was our initial inspiration for starting this project.

After each presentation, we had a QnA where many good suggestions were made, which everybody followed up on after all the presentations over snacks. Our team received a helpful suggestion from the Tokyo Tech and Gifu team about the use of a histidine tag to simplify and speed up the protein purification process, also making a more accurate result. </DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
