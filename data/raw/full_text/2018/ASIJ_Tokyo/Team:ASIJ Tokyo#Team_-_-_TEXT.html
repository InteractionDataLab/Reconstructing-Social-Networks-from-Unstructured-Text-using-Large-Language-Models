Senior
Saloni Agarwal
Hi, my name is Saloni and I am currently a senior at the American School in Japan. I've only been to one school my entire life so I haven't seen much of any other school. I was born and raised in Japan but grew up in an Indian household. Some of my hobbies, other than science, include art and music.
Senior
Noe Anderson
Hi! I'm Noe and I'm a senior. I love to watch TV shows (crime) and figure skating. My other hobbies include sleeping and drawing, and I hope my graphic design skills can be of some use in the team. I learned html and css over summer and am now part of the wiki team! I hope you enjoy our website!
Senior
Eliot Behr
Hello, my name is Eliot, and I'm a senior who enjoys pursuing science. My favorite musician is Elliott Smith and I like the Boston Celtics. I hope to become a doctor in the future and believe iGEM will offer me valuable lab work experience.

My favorite sports are Aussie rules and rugby, but I haven't been able to do either in Japan. My favorite band is the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but I love all kinds of music. I take interest in chemistry and biology and often find myself reading about new discoveries.
Sophomore

Hello! I'm Misaki, I'm a junior, and this is my first year in iGEM. I moved to Tokyo last year from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I've been playing the violin for more than 10 years now. Even though music has been a major part of my life, I am focused towards science and iGEM gives me a place to challenge my skills while having fun. Random fact about myself: If I could only eat one food for the rest of my life, it will be ratatouille.
