Human Practices
Raising awareness about the development of gene editing techniques and the future use of iPS stem cells was an integral aspect of our project. We addressed the three aspects of human practices (integrated practices, educational outreach, and collaboration
Education Outreach
Colaboration and Integrated Practices
DNA Fingerprinting with ASIJ Summer Passport Program
June 21st, 2018:
During the ASIJ Summer Passport program, iGEM students helped to educate middle school students taking a forensic science course about utilizing fingerprints for crime investigation. We talked about the use of gel electrophoresis and explained the function of restriction enzymes and electricity for the experiment. Finally, we let everyone in the group use the scientific procedure to discover their unique fingerprints.
Talk with Dr. Kagimoto
June 4th, 2018
The iGEM team met with Dr. Hardy Kagimoto, founder of the Japanese biotech company Healios. During our meeting with him, we learned about the possible future implications of iPS cell technology and the development of this new industry in the context of Japanese regulations. We were inspired by his work and wanted to know how we could also contribute to this field of research. The talk with him was our initial inspiration for starting this project.
GOA Online Presentation
September 17, 2018
iGEM students talked to Medical Problem Solving I students on Global Online Academy (GOA) about future treatments with immunotherapy, gene therapy, and cell therapy with iPS stem cells. GOA is a collection of online courses that are in schools in over 24 countries, allowing us to reach a broad and multinational group of students. In our presentation, we implemented a case study with A1AD Deficiency to showcase our use of CRISPR editing in our iGEM project and future use of organ buds.
i-GEM Pakistan Video Call
June _____, 2018
During the summer portion of our lab work, we participated in a Skype call with the Pakistan high school iGEM team, known as LACAS Biobots. We explained our projects to each other, took virtual lab tours, and got to know another HS team and the different ways in which various teams work.
Back to School Night
September 20, 2018
During Back to School Night, iGEM students presented our iGEM team and project to parents of high school students at the American School in Japan.
Tokyo Tech Meetup
August 8, 2018
During the summer, iGEM teams from across Japan attended a meetup held by Tokyo Tech University. KAIT, Bochan lab, Gifu University, Tokyo Tech, and ASIJ. Our team presented, along with the other teams, the progress we have made throughout the year. After each presentation, we had a QnA where many good suggestions were made, which everybody followed up on after all the presentations over snacks. Our team received a helpful suggestion from the Tokyo Tech and Gifu team about the use of a histidine tag to simplify and speed up the protein purification process, also making a more accurate result.
