BBa_K2562000
SERPINA1 gene coding for Alpha-1-antitrypsin
The SERPINA1 gene coding for the Alpha-1 Antitrypsin protein is derived from Homo sapiens. In studying the point mutation E342K, or the replacement of glutamic acid with lysine, this coding sequence can be used as a control, as it remains unmutated.
BBa_K2562001
E342K point mutation in SERPINA1 gen
The SERPINA1 gene coding for the Alpha-1 Antitrypsin protein is derived from Homo sapiens. The coding sequence has a point mutation at E342K, a replacement of glutamic acid for lysine. The mutation accounts for Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, in which the lack of Alpha-1 antitrypsin leads to a defective lung and liver.
BBa_K2562002
E342K point mutation corrected through CRISPR technology in the SERPINA1 gene
The SERPINA1 gene coding for the Alpha-1 Antitrypsin protein is derived from Homo sapiens. We used CRISPR technology to cut out the faulty mutation and replace the E342K point mutation with its correct amino acid in the SERPINA1 gene.
BBa_K2562003
SERPINA1 secretion using an OsmY tag, a GFP reporter system, and a double terminator
The SERPINA1 gene coding for the Alpha-1 Antitrypsin protein is derived from Homo sapiens. Secretion was optimized through the use of an OsmY tag and reported through GFP fluorescence.

Secretion of SERPINA1 with E342K point mutation using an OsmY tag, a GFP reporter system, and a double terminator
The SERPINA1 gene coding for the Alpha-1 Antitrypsin protein is derived from Homo sapiens.The SERPINA1 coding sequence has a point mutation at E342K, a replacement of glutamic acid for lysine. The mutation accounts for Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, in which the lack of Alpha-1 antitrypsin leads to a defective lung and liver. Its secretion was optimized through an OsmY tag and reported through GFP fluorescence.

Secretion of CRISPR corrected E342K mutation in SERPINA1 using an OsmY tag, a GFP reporter system, and a double terminator
The SERPINA1 gene coding for the Alpha-1 Antitrypsin protein is derived from Homo sapiens. The coding sequence has a point mutation at E342K, a replacement of glutamic acid for lysine. We used CRISPR technology to cut out the faulty mutation and replace the E342K point mutation with its correct amino acid in the SERPINA1 gene. Secretion was optimized through the use of an OsmY tag and reported through GFP fluorescence.
BBa_K2562006
SERPINA1 secretion using an OsmY tag,  His tag, a GFP reporter system, and single terminator
The SERPINA1 gene coding for the Alpha-1 Antitrypsin protein is derived from Homo sapiens. Secretion was optimized through the use of an OsmY tag and a His tag and reported through GFP fluorescence.        Recommended: For protein purification, nickel lined chromatography tubes were used for this because of the His tag.
