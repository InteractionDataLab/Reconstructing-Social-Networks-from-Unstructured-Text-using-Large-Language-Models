H2O2 DECOMPOSITION MODEL
Purpose
In our experiment, we found it hard to measure the intracellular H2O2 concentration, so we                     controlled the external H2O2 concentration in culture to confirm our system'                     function. Although the                     H2O2 can entry the cell quickly through simple diffusion, we needed to build                     up a model to simulate                     the intracellular H2O2. At the same time, this model will provide a base for                     roGFP2-Orp1 Michealis                     equation model.
Model simulation
Firstly, in order to describe the process in cells more accurately, three reactions in this process                     are considered: diffusion, fast degradation and slow degradation. The fast degradation is caused by                     some natural reduction molecular (like Glutathione) directly react with H2O2.                     And slow degradation                     is led by enzymatic degradation.[1]

ODE model
$$\frac{\mathrm{d_{\mathit{p}_{e}}} }{\mathrm{d} t}=k_{1}(p_{i}-p_{e})v$$
$$\frac{\mathrm{d_{\mathit{p}_{i}}}                     }{\mathrm{d}t}=k_{1}(p_{e}-p_{i})-(k_{2}+k_{3}\frac{g}{k_{g}+g})p_{i}$$
$$\frac{\mathrm{d_{\mathit{g}}} }{\mathrm{d} t}=-k_{3}(\frac{g}{k_{g}+g})p_{i}$$
The ODE model accounted for intracellular and extracellular H2O2 levels, and the                     consumption of a finite                     antioxidant capacity using three rates:
1) The membrane permeability (k1).[2][3][4]
2) Intracellular slow degradation rate (k2).[5]
3) Intracellular fast degradation rate (k3) dependent upon a finite capacity (g), e.g. NADPH                         levels in naive cells.[6]
We reviewed the above literature and combined the results of the wet experiment, as shown in Fig.3,                     to determine the parameters required for the model simulation, listed in the table below.

Simulation result
We used MATLAB to simulate the kinetics of extracellular and intracellular H2O2 changes over time.                     (Fig. 2)

Experimental result
To verify the feasibility of the model and to confirm this dynamic process, we did some experiments                     using our system's output, roGFP2-Orp1. The results show that the fluorescence ratio value                     I405/I488, an oxidant condition indicator, decreased by time when S. cerevisiae exposed to                     different concentrations of H2O2. This ratio's decreasing stands for the                     increasing of                     intercellular H2O2 concentration. It also stopped at a stable concentration at last, which's                     correspond to our model's result.

Summary
In this model, we successfully simulated the kinetics of extracellular and intracellular H2O2 changes over time. Furthermore, the dynamic process of fluorescence ratio value by time was                     detected by using roGFP2-Orp1 green fluorescent protein in wet experiment, and the feasibility of                     the model was further verified.
