FLUORESCENT PROBE MODEL
Background
It can be seen from the reaction pathway that when the probe is excessive, the fluorescence                     intensity should be linear with the hydrogen peroxide content at a specific time. The model                     validates this linear relationship through experimental data and predicts future possible outcomes                     by constructing a linear regression model. Linear regression analysis
Definition
H2O2: The concentration of H2O2, units in mM.
FOD: Florescence intensity / OD.
Scatter Plot
The Scatter Plot of data are demonstrated below.
Fig.1
From the chart, it is clear that the FOD is in proportion to the H2O2, only                     when H2O2 is between                     0-2.5 mM. The data in the points that H2O2 is 5 are obviously not obeying                     linear model. Thus, we                     consider to building a linear model between 0 and 2.5mM of H2O2. The new                     Scatter Plot of this part                     of data is showed below.
Fig.2
The scatter plot witnessed a significant linearity of between FOD and H2O2,                     so we tend to use a                     linear model to predict and explain the results.
Model Construction
With the criteria of the least square, we construct following linear model
$$FOD_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\ H_{2}O_{2_{i}}+\epsilon_{i},\epsilon_{i} \sim                     N(0,\sigma^2)$$
The property of the model are demonstrated below
Fig.3
It is obvious that the data fits linear model well and the parameters are following
$$FOD_{i}=4752+1214.48\ H_{2}O_{2_{i}}+\epsilon_{i},\epsilon_{i} \sim                     N(0,425.9)$$
The data along with the fitted values of the model and the confidence interval are pictured below.
Fig.4
Residuals Analysis
We also run a residuals analysis to ensure this linear model is proper to fit the data. First, we                     draw histogram and QQ-plot of standard residuals.
Fig.5
Fig.6
From the histogram, the standard residuals equally drop in the two sides of zero, which means that                     the residuals are possibly independent. Also, the QQ-plot implies the significant normality of                     residuals.
Results and Inspirations
The linear model we constructed validates the linearity between the concentration of H2O2 and the                     fluorescence intensity divided by the OD value, which the H2O2 is in the                     interval from 0 to 2.5mM.                     And we also analyzed the residuals of the model to ensure it works well. With this model, we can                     properly predict the output when the concentration of H2O2 is in certain                     interval.
