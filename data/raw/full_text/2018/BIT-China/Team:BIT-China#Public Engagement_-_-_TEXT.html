EDUCATION & PUBLIC ENGAGMENT
Helping other teams / iGEM bases training
ITCCC
In July 13th, we got an invitation to introduce iGEM to preparatory members of high                                 school team                                 in ITCCC (INTERNATIONAL TEENAGER COMPETITION AND COMMUNICATION CENTER). Our team leader gave a                                 speech about iGEM and some of team members answered the questions. After the speech, the high                                 school students had a further understanding and got more interests about iGEM. In which, we                                 brought our years of experiences on iGEM to them.
BCU
Between July 17th and 21st, our team and team BCU conducted an                                 communication of iGEM, mainly                                 about the InterLab experiments. BCU is a young iGEM team. So, as an experienced team, we                                 BIT-China helped them. We provided them with some conveniences on instruments and reagents. In                                 five days, we completed the InterLab experiments, analyzing and discussing them based on the                                 experimental data obtained. This exchange established the foundation for the communication of                                 the two teams in future projects, and we all benefited from this exchange.
Education to younger generation
Back in high school, if someone would show us the beauty of biology, we think there would be                                 more students choose to study biology in college. Therefore, to expand the influence of                                 synthetic biology, we delivered a lecture to high school students of Capital Normal University                                 High School in Beijing, during which we introduced iGEM giant jamboree and our project, WHO CAN                                 GET AN A to them. Through the lecture, not only did high school students gained a better                                 insight into such a meaningful competition, but also we knew more about our own project and                                 started to think a new way to let public understand our project.
Public Engagement
We always want the public to learn more about synthetic biology and iGEM. We believe that if                                 you want to promote something, you should publicize it in a way which is closer and appealing                                 to the public. At the age of big data, using the popularity of new-media industry to spread                                 ideas is more convenient, more extensive, and more effective. Therefore, we decided to film some videos to promote synthetic biology and iGEM.
Videos about synthetic biology
In order to spread the knowledge of synthetic biology to the public and to publicize our                                 projects, we have taken several beauty blogger-style videos about synthetic biology and                                 published them on several video platforms (Which are most used by young people in China). We                                 believed this kind of way to popularize science is effective. In the video, our team members                                 introduced the knowledge including the pipette and the plate coating in vivid form and humorous                                 tone. The videos are very popular and get many positive influence.
Video about iGEMer
We always want to promote the influence of iGEM, and let more people know how important iGEM is                                 for iGEMers. So we filmed a video to show how an iGEMer find herself by attending an iGEM                                 team(BIT-China) and published it on several video platforms. The video is based on the mv of Taylor Swift`s Delicate. This video not only shows a growing road of an iGEMer, but also let                                 more people learn about iGEM.
