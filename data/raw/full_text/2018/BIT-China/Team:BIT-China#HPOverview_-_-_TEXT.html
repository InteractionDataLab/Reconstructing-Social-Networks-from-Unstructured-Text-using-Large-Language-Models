As the iGEM web said, before you pick up your first pipette you should think about Human Practices.                     Human Practices is an integral aspect of iGEM.
As we advance our project, we always think about how our work be responsible and good for the                     world. At                     the same time, we want the society to influence the direction of our project. In order to show what                     we                     did in Human Practices part, we divided an iGEM project into four parts: purpose, design,                     execution,                     and outreach, demonstrate respectively in the Integrated Human Practices                     and Education & Public Engagement modules.
Now, we present you how we use HP as a channel to open up the gap between the laboratory and the                     society.
