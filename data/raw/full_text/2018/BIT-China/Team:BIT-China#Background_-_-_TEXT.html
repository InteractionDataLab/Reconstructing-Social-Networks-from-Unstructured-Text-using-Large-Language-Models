BACKGROUND
What is ROS?
Fig. 1 Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) refers to substances that have strong oxidative properties in                         living organisms. ROS are mainly divided into four categories: hydrogen peroxide(H2O2),                         superoxide anion(O2-), hydroxyl radicals(OH-), and single-line                         oxygen(1[O2]). [1]
The harm of the ROS
Fig. 2 ROS can cause oxidative damage
The overproduction of ROS in body organisms could lead to the damage to nucleic acids, lipids                         and proteins, impede normal cellular metabolism, worse more, those oxidized substances can                         attack bodies too. The accumulation of oxidative damage will eventually induce kinds of                         diseases, such as aging, initiate cancer, arteriosclerosis and heart disease. [2]
What are antioxidants?
Fig. 3 Glutathione, one of Antioxidants
Antioxidants are compounds that inhibit oxidation.
Antioxidants can scavenge the excess ROS in the organisms. The antioxidants mentioned here is                         not antioxidants for food preservation, nor reductants, but working in organisms. [3]
The classification of antioxidants
To better study the performance of antioxidants in the market, we divide them into two                         categories: direct antioxidants and indirect antioxidants, according to the mechanism of                         antioxidant action. Direct antioxidants exert antioxidant effects by redox reaction to                         scavenging or inhibiting free radicals, such as vitamin C, vitamins E and proanthocyanidins.                         And indirect antioxidants achieve antioxidant activity by regulating gene expression and                         intracellular metabolism in cell endogenous antioxidant system, such as the natural                         antioxidants oleuropein, [4]quercetin, and the synthetic antioxidant probucol. The                         antioxidants that are commonly found in cosmetics and health products on the market today are                         vitamin C, vitamin E, tea polyphenols, etc.
The prospect in the field of antioxidants and detection
In recent years, with the improvement of people's living standards and the aging of the                         population, health, anti-oxidant and anti-aging have attracted people's attention more and                         become hotspots. According to statistics, the scale of China's medical and health industry has                         increased from 1.6 trillion yuan in 2009 to 5.6 trillion yuan in 2016. And it is estimated that                         by 2020, the total size of China's medical and health industry will exceed 8 trillion yuan. [5]
Because of the functions of anti-oxidant, anti-aging, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, vascular activation and the capacity of scavenging the excess ROS in the organisms, antioxidants have a                         remarkable prospect in the fields of pharmaceuticals, health products and cosmetics. [6]
Through literature review and data collection, we learned that the current antioxidant testing                         methods on the market are not good enough, which means, there is no standard method for us to                         judge the effects of antioxidants. So we want to establish a convenient and efficient standard                         and detection method for evaluate antioxidants. Additionally, how to accurately evaluate the                         activity of antioxidants is also a hot topic in the field of antioxidants research. [7] Besides, the public resist synthetic antioxidants and inclined to choose natural antioxidants. Check                             here to know what people want for antioxidants detection. [8] The most amazing thing is that countless excellent natural antioxidants are hidden in nature.                         We just need a key of antioxidants detection method to open the huge treasure house of nature.
Here showed the current detecting methods that we collected in the market:
The existing methods of detecting antioxidants:
Human studies and animal models
Fig. 4 Detecting methods based on human/animal cells
In these existing assays for detection of antioxidants, human studies and animal models could                         give us the most truthful and reliable measurement results could. However, these are expensive                         and time-consuming and not available for initial screening antioxidants. [9]
Chemistry methods
Fig. 5 Chemistry methods
Chemistry methods were widely-used, including oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) [10] , total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP) [11] , Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) [12] , total oxyradical scavenge capacity (TOSC) [13] , the peroxyl scavenging capacity (PSC) [14] , the ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay (FRAP) [15] , and the DPPH free radical method [16] . Although these chemistry methods are currently widely-use, their main measurement principle                         is to characterize the reducibility of antioxidants by virous artificially synthesized                         exogenous free radical occurring redox reactions with the antioxidants. As a result, chemistry                         methods have the shortcoming of low biological relevance, their detecting conditions are almost                         different from the physiological environment of cell living in, and these assays can’t evaluate                         the effects of antioxidants in the complicated metabolic process. That means, chemical methods                         are unable tot evaluate indirect antioxidants properly. [17][18] Therefore, the authenticity of the experimental results of chemistry methods is questioned. [19] For example, USDA's Nutrient Data Laboratory (NDL) removed the USDA ORAC Database for Selected                         Foods from the NDL website in 2012, because of the poor authenticity and low credibility of the                         chemistry methods. [20]
Cell-based assays
Compared to human studies and animal models, our program has shorter cycles, lower costs and                         lower detection difficulty. Compared to chemistry methods, our project is compatible with                         complex metabolic processes in cells, and biological relevance and data reliability have been                         greatly improved. In addition, our project can also detect the indirect antioxidants that can’t                         be evaluate by chemistry methods, such as antioxidants that functions by stimulating the                         endogenous antioxidant system in cells, which have not antioxidant capacity without cells.
Cell-based methods for evaluating antioxidants are a novel field. Cell-based antioxidants                         detection methods that people have developed can be roughly divided into three types. The first                         type is the CAA assay and MTT assay developed from the traditional chemistry methods. The                         second type is the cell-based electrochemical method evolved from the traditional                         electrochemical methods. The third type is the engineered cells that we use to synthesize                         biology. The third one utilize the engineering cells transformed by synthetic biological                         methods, which can detect and evaluate the antioxidants.
CAA assay
Fig. 6 CAA assay
CAA assay [21] is cell-based assay, but it still doesn’t break through the limitations of traditional                         chemistry methods. Firstly, it still produces free radicals using artificial synthetic                         materials used in traditional chemistry methods, such as ABAP (Azo compound) which are                         criticized for cells. [22]
Secondly, the CAA assay uses an artificial synthetic fluorescent probe DCFH-DA, which is widely                         used to detect ROS currently, but the authenticity of the data obtained by this probe is                         questioned. [23]
MTT assay
Fig. 7 MTT assay
MTT assay [24][25] breaks through the defect that the traditional chemical method can only detect single free                         radical, and the cell survival rate is used as the standard to characterize the antioxidant                         activity. However, the evaluation of MTT assay is not very good, because its detection                         condition is too critical for the cell and the cell survival pressure is very high. [26]
Cell-based electrochemical assay
Fig. 8 Cell-based electrochemical detection method
Cell-based electrochemical detection method, [27] which is based on the traditional electrochemistry and the bio-electrochemical probe. This kind                         of method has high sensitivity and can realize real-time monitoring which is its unique                         feature. But the high cost and critical requirement of equipment limits this method used                         widely.

What are we going to do?
Based on the problems mentioned above, we want to screen excellent antioxidants to help us                         scavenge ROS against aging and diseases. Our goal is to build a system with function of                         detecting the antioxidants and has the advantages of high biological relevance, simple                         operation, low-cost, good reproducibility, accuracy, and high sensitivity for antioxidant                         detection. More importantly, we hope to establish an efficient standard for evaluating                         antioxidants through our system.
