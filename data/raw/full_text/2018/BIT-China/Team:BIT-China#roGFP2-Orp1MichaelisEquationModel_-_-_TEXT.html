roGFP2-Orp1 MICHAELIS EQUATION MODEL
Purpose
In the previous model, we successfully obtained the relationship between intracellular H2O2 concentration and extracellular H2O2 concentration. Therefore, we were going                     to establish the                     relationship between intracellular H2O2 concentration and roGFP2-Orp1 in                     order to evaluate the                     antioxidant function signal output of our entire system.
Model Hypothesis
1. The roGFP2-Orp1 is a fusion protein, and Orp1 is a catalase. Therefore, the reaction process of                     the protein with H2O2 can be considered as a classical enzymatic reaction                     meaning that this                     reaction is a  roGFP2-Orp1 Michaelis equation Model, and the oxidation state of roGFP2 is one of the reaction products.
2. The total intracellular concentration of roGFP2 is constant. And roGFP2 has two states,                     oxidative state and reductive state. And the intracellular protein concentration is depended on the                     transcription rate of promoter.
3. The two absorption peak values of roGFP2 at 405 nm and 488 nm are linear with the protein                     concentration in two states.
Model analysis and construction
According to Hypothesis 1, we consider the reaction process of intracellular hydrogen peroxide with                     roGFP2 as an enzymatic reaction process, which is consistent with the roGFP2-Orp1 Michaelis equation Model.
$$V=\frac{v_{max}[H_{2}O_{2}]}{K_{m}+[H_{2}O_{2}]}$$
Here we define a new parameter OxDroGFP2 to reflect the degree of oxidation of                     roGFP2.                     Meanwhile, facilitate subsequent calculations.
$$OxD_{roGFP2}=\frac{[roGFP2_{ox}]}{[roGFP2_{ox}]+[roGFP2_{red}]}$$
According to Hypothesis 3, we can correlate the redox state of roGFP2 with the fluorescence value                     measured by the macroscopic observables easily. To establish this relationship, several molecular                     quantities followed need to be defined. i405red, i405ox, i488red,                     and i488ox are the fluorescence                     intensities contributed by a single roGFP2 molecule at the indicated wavelength and redox state.                     Ntotal is the total number of roGFP2 molecules. Nred is the number of reduced                     roGFP2 molecules. Nox is the number of oxidized roGFP2 molecules. Based on the assumption that the overall fluorescence                     intensity is equal to the sum of the fluorescence intensities from the individual roGFP2 molecules,                     the relationships were given in Table 1.
Table 1. Relationships Between Fluorescence Intensities and Probe Molecules
Condition
Formula
Limiting condition 1:
Ntotal = Nred
I405red = Ntotal · i405red
Complete reduction
Nox = 0
I488red = Ntotal · i488red
Limiting condition 2:
Ntotal = Nox
I405ox = Ntotal · i405ox
Complete oxidation
Nred = 0
I488ox = Ntotal · i488ox
Actual measurement
Ntotal = Nred + Nox
I405 = Nox · i405ox + Nred · i405red
I488 = Nox · i488ox + Nred · i488red
By substituting the resulting equations (right column of Table 3) into OxDroGFP2=Nox/Ntotal,                     the                     relationship between OxDroGFP2 and the macroscopic observables can be deduced.[1]
$$oxD_{roGFP2}=\frac{I405\cdot I488_{red}-I405_{red}\cdot I488}{I405\cdot I488_{red}-I405\cdot                     I488_{ox}+I405_{ox}\cdot I488-I405_{red}\cdot I488}$$
After the above relationship is completed, since the absolute protein concentration determination                     is difficult, we define the relative reaction rate as
$$V^{'}=\frac{V}{[roGFP2_{ox}]+[roGFP2_{red}]}$$
$$OxD_{roGFP2}=\frac{[roGFP2_{ox}]}{[roGFP2_{ox}]+[roGFP2_{red}]}$$
$$V^{'}=\frac{OxD^{'}-OxD}{t^{'}-t}$$
At the same time, according to Hypothesis 2, roGFP2total is constant, but the protein                     concentration could not be measured by us. So we thought that under the same promoter conditions,                     the protein concentration was basically the same and according to the data provided in the previous                     literature, it is known that in yeast cells, the Eno2 protein concentration is around 0.5                     mM.[2]
So we could get:
$$[roGFP2_{total}]=0.5\ mM$$
In order to obtain the two constants in the Michealis equation, we measured the reaction rate of the                     reaction in yeast cells by applying different concentrations of H2O2 and                     using the simulation                     results of the H2O2 Decomposition Model in combination with the function of                     roGFP2. The results                     were as follows:

$$K_{m}=0.451642$$
The relationship between the change in fluorescence intensity of roGFP2 and the concentration of                     intracellular H2O2 is set up successfully.
Summary
Our model has been successfully implemented. Different concentrations of intracellular H2O2 can change                 the spectral properties of our system's roGFP2, and successfully convert our selected ROS signal                 (Intracellular H2O2 concentration) into a visualized fluorescent signal that                 means we can evaluate the                 intracellular H2O2 concentration easily through calculate the OxD value.                 However, due to time and experimental limitation, our model is only a preliminary establishment, and                 its subsequent calibration work is limited by experiment and time, there is no enough time to continue                 optimization .We also hoped that there will be follow-up teams to continue to finish our models.
