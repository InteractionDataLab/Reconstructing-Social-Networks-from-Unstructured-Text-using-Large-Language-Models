PARTS
In 2018, BIT-China has submitted 16 parts. We divide our parts into 3 group, Regulator,                         Feedback and Output. Each group contains some parts with similar function or close relation.                         Different groups also connect with each other.
Regulator
Increase ROS Content
BBa_K2765026 and BBa_K2765021 is a collection of regulate components including coding                         protein and expression cassette, which can increase the accumulation of intracellular ROS                         through overexpressing yon1 induced by galactose.
Improve Tolerance
BBa_K2765030 is 1000bp homologous arm of yca1 gene, which can knock out yca1 gene                         through                         homologous recombination so that the yeast's tolerance to H2O2 could be                         improved.
Feedback
Control ROS Content
BBa_K2765000~BBa_K2765005 is a collection of feedback components that are downstream                         gene                         promoter of Yap1. We use them to turn on the expression of dCas9 which can inhibit the                         expression of yno1 gene. Considering the application of our system in the future, to realize                         different feedback effect, we verified different promoters, GLR1p, SOD2p, TRR1p, TRX2p and GSH1p,                         with different transcription level.
Output
Detect ROS content
BBa_K2765040~BBa_K2765053 is a collection of output components including promoters,                         coding                         protein and expression cassette, which can express redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein                         roGFP2-Orp1 and display ROS content in cells by its fluorescence ratio.
According to this measurement principle, the concentration of whole roGFP2-Orp1 can influence                         the final signal output strength, even detect the same sample, so we verified four promoters,                         FBA1, TEF2, TEF1 and ENO2, with different transcription level to solve this interfere.                         Considering the application of our system in the future, we made this collection and wished                         these parts can be used in different antioxidant detection.
Improve a previous part
We performed codon optimization on team Connell 2017's previous part BBa_K2296006 and obtained our core part BBa_K2296006, which codes for roGFP2-Orp1 protein. Also we got As a result, it is more suitable                         to our chassis organisms---yeast and has better expression in yeast. Check                             here to know further                             information.
