Overview
The objective of this year’s interlab is to test a more direct method of fluorescence measurements than those currently used in an effort to achieve better reproducibility in life science experiments. By computing the results of absorbance and fluorescence obtained by hundreds of teams around the world, this study will help identify and correct the sources of systematic variability in measurements. The absorbance and fluorescence measurements were performed with a plate reader which was kindly lent to us by the Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Bioinformatics at Laval University. As we also had the chance to be able to access a flow cytometer as well as SpheroTech calibration beads, our team also participated in the cytometry measurements experiment. The cytometer was kindly lent to us by the Landry laboratory (Laval University) while the beads were kindly given to us by the Centre Hospitalier de l’Université Laval (CHUL). The iGEM ULaval team will be pleased to communicate their results upon request:  igem@bcm.ulaval.ca

Calibration
For the calibration, three different protocols were used: an OD600 reference point, a particle standard curve, and a fluorescence standard curve. In order to produce valid results, those measurements used the same plates, volumes, and settings than the cell-based assays.
Calibration 1:​ OD​600 Reference point - LUDOX Protocol
The LUDOX protocol ( plate reader , page 2) was used to transform Abs600 measurements taken from a plate reader into comparable OD600 measurements. The arithmetic means for the absorbance of LUDOX CL-X and water of the four replicates were used to calculate the corrected Abs600 (value of 0.045). By using an OD600 reference of 0.063, we found a conversion factor of 1.39.

Calibration 2:​ Particle Standard Curve
A particle standard curve was obtained by plotting the Abs600 against several concentrations of monodisperse silica microspheres. The data was analyzed by performing a linear regression analysis.

Calibration 3:​ Fluorescence Standard Curve
Linear fluorescence standard curves were constructed by plotting the fluorescence intensities against several concentrations of monodisperse silica microspheres. The data was analyzed by performing a linear regression analysis.

Cell Measurement
For the cell measurements, a strain of Escherichia coli K-12 DH5-alpha has been used by all the iGEM teams.
Bacterial cells were transformed with the eight following devices:

Two colonies from each transformation were picked up and incubated overnight in 10mL LB medium + Chloramphenicol at 37°C and 220 RPM. Abs600 and fluorescence were measured after 0 and 6 hours of incubation.
The Equation 1 presents the mean of the ratio between net fluorescence and net Abs600 multiplied by the ratio of the two unit scaling factor found during Calibration 2 and 3 (i.e. for each replicate).

The Equation 2 presents the mean of the ration between net fluorescence and net Abs600 multiplied by the ratio of the two unit scaling factor found during Calibration 1 and 3 (i.e. for each replicate).

Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E. coli cultures
This protocol used both the Negative ( BBa_R0040 ) and Positive Control ( BBa_I20270 ) cultivated during the Cell Measurement. Those for sampling (A1-A2: Positive Control (t=0 and 6h); B1-B2: Negative Control (t=0 and 6h)) were diluted to reach an OD600 between 0.097 and 0.239 with the LB+Cam solution. For each culture, triplicates of 200μL were prepared (receptively I, II and III). For all the triplicates, serial dilutions were made and, as a result, three dilutions were selected for each replicate; Dilution 3 (8E-3), Dilution 4 (8E-4) and Dilution 5 (8E-5). These cell cultures were incubated overnight before calculating the number of colonies for each plate and multiplying those number by the Final Dilution Factor (8E4, 8E5 and 8E6, receptively) to obtain the colony forming units (CFU) per 1mL of an OD600 of 0.1.
