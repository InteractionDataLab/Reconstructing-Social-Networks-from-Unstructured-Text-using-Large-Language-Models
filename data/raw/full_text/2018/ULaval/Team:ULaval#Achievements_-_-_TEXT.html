Silver
Collaborations : We collaborated with at least one of the registered 2018 iGEM teams in a significative way. See Collaborations .
Human Practices : Scientific research is not only about science, it is also about its impact on the society and environment. To better understand the bioethics aspects of our project, we met with a philosophy teacher and a philosophy student. They helped us understand the repercussions of our project and helped us design a survey to gather public input on various implications of our project. Our survey was designed to answer questions about ecology, economy, ethics and society. We also discussed these themes with other iGEM teams as mentioned above. Finally, we talked about our project on social media, in university classes  and we made a radio interview to explain our project.
