Our Team
As part of the international Genetically Engineered Machine competition, a student team was assembled at Laval University to create a biological system that meets a major current need: adrenaline synthesis at a lower cost, with milder experimental conditions and fewer environmental impacts. Our team is multidisciplinary, motivated and creative. We wish to make history by realizing the biosynthesis of adrenaline for the first time.

Advisors
Steve Charette
Principal Investigator
My interests in science concern the interactions between bacteria and protists as well as bacterial virulence. I am fascinated by synthetic biology and all the potential for development that this science promises us. I still play with Lego bricks that have a lot of parallels with synthetic biology! Incidentally, I am also the Director of the Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Bioinformatics! As a result, I help our iGEM team for logistical and financial aspects.
Hélène Deveau
Helene Deveau received her PhD degree in Microbiology from Université Laval in 2006. During her post-doctoral study, she investigate the function of strange repeat in DNA sequence: the CRISPRs. Since 2010, she is lecturer at the Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Bioinformatics. This year, she participated to the creation of the first iGEM team for the Université Laval.
Michel Guertin
Michel was always interested in cellular evolution and protein structure, function and engineering. After receiving his PhD, he became a professor at Université Laval. In recent years, he has taken interest in synthetic biology, more precisely on the economic aspects of synth. bio. and the impacts that it has on society. When the iGEM project was presented, he was eager to participate and oversee the student team.
