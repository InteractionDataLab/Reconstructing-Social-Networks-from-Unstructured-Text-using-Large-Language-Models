As part of the international Genetically Engineered Machine competition, a student team was assembled at Laval University to create a biological system that meets a major current need: adrenaline synthesis at a lower cost, with milder experimental conditions and fewer environmental impacts. Our team is multidisciplinary, motivated and creative. We wish to make history by realizing the biosynthesis of adrenaline for the first time.

                    <B>Motivation to join iGEM :</B> I’ve always been amazed at what synthetic biology could allow us to do. Wanted to do the extra mile to bring synth. bio. in my University, decided that starting an iGEM team to regroup all the people with similar interests to work toward a common goal was the best way to do so. I was blown away by the support and interest the team got for a first year!

                My interests in science concern the interactions between bacteria and protists as well as bacterial virulence. I am fascinated by synthetic biology and all the potential for development that this science promises us. I still play with Lego bricks that have a lot of parallels with synthetic biology! Incidentally, I am also the Director of the Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Bioinformatics! As a result, I help our iGEM team for logistical and financial aspects.
