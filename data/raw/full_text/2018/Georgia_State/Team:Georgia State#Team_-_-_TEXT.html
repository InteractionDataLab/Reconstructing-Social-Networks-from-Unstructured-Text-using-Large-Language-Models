What is the funniest thing that’s ever happened to you?
The first time I entered a McDonald's restaurant in the United States was the funniest experience I had. I went to order a drink and there were different cup sizes. The choices were small, regular or large. I ordered a regular size of Coke. Then seconds later, the waitress came back with a gigantic cup of Coke. I told her that I asked for a regular size cup. She looked at me, laughed and told me that it was a regular size. I looked back at her, I laughed too. I was really surprised by the size difference between France and the United States. I realized that at McDonald's, the smallest size in the United States corresponds to the largest size in France. This was unbelievable!
