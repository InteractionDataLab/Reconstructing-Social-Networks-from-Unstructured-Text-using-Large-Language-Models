hCG & Beta 3 Loop Fusion
As seen on our results page, we were able to successfully express the recombinant form of the hCG Beta subunit and the Beta 3 loop subunit. While we were not able to detect our proteins with an over the counter pregnancy test, we were able to demonstrate that they were able to be detected using an anti-hCG antibody that we purchased for the purpose of Western Blotting.
