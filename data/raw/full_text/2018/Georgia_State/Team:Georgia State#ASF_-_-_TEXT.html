Atlanta Science Festival
The Atlanta Science Festival gave our team the opportunity to get kids engaged into the world of science. This festival occurs in Downtown Atlanta every March and is open to all who want to get involved in the STEM community. We set up our table with a “Pipette Painting” workshop where they could learn the basics of using a micropipette. We talked to the kids about what DNA is and encouraged them to match the colors of nucleotide pairs on their DNA coloring sheet. It was exciting to watch all the young faces at our booth concentrate hard on using their pipettes. This event reminded us that a love for science should develop at a young age, and that science should be accessible to people of every background.
