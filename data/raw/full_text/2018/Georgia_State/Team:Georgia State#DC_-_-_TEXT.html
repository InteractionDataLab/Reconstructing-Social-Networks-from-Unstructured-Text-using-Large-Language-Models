Dragon Con
This past year, we participated in DragonCon in Atlanta. It is an event that occurs each year around the same period of time, in which people dress up as fictional characters and attend various workshops and seminars of their particular interest. The purpose of attending this event is to expose the science fiction community about biology and present to them our project idea. This represents public engagement  because we went to an audience that is not necessarily made up of scientists, but they may have an interest in the world of science. We attempted to bridge the gap between scientists and a lay audience so that they could have a better understanding on how some scientific techniques work. Overall, exposing our work to a different community gave us a better insight on how to make our project more relatable to the lay audience.
