The iGEM 2018 USP-Brazil team is thankful for all the financial, technical and intellectual support given. We wouldn’t have been able to participate in the competition without the support of the University of São Paulo and their Institutes. Reagents and DNA sequences were provided by New England BioLabs and Integrated DNA Technologies, which were essential for our wet lab experiments and the assembly of our parts was more efficient with the SnapGene software. The modelling and the analysis of our data was productive using the tools provided by MatLab. The BioRender database allowed us to make good quality figures and diagrams with much ease. We thank each and every one of our sponsors.
