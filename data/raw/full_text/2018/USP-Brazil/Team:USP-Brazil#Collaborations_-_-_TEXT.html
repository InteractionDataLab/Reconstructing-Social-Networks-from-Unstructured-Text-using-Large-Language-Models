Latin America
In our search to expand and build bridges within Latin America’s synthetic biology community we collaborated directly with team USP-EEL-Brazil and Team TecCEM, who hosted a Latin America meetup which we attended through video conference. We also attended to the brazillian team Jamboree, at the beginning of the year.
USP-EEL-Brazil
USP-EEL-Brazil team worked with estrogen contamination in water and needed their hormones in a purified form to test their degradation. We got in touch with Professor Wothan Tavares de Lima, who gladly provided us with the samples used by the team.
TecCEM
In the meetup hosted by TecCEM team we discussed the teams projects and received feedback on our project, especially in regards to how we designed ou plasmids and on their workings.   As a result of the meetup we were kindly invited to take part in the “Moves like iGEM” video in september.
Brazillian Meetup
One of our members attended to the brazillian team "Jamboré", at the start of the year, where we could share experiences from veterans, project ideas, and ultimately bond and strengthen our brazillian iGEMers community. The meetup was organized by the USP-ESALQ prospective team, that is planning on entering the competition in the near future. Teams USP-EEL, UNESP-AQA were present, along with other prospective teams, ranging from the whole country, from Rio de Janeiro to Manaus. The experience was great and we hope to see more iGEM teams in Brazil rise from this collaboration!
Düsseldorf
In an effort to evaluate how our system would respond to the chemically characterized HSL molecule, we got in touch with Duesseldorf team 2018. They kindly provided us 3OC6 HSL for our Lux system, which allowed us to conclude that our project has a great potential to test not only biological but also chemical crosstalk between different quorum sensing devices. This can be performed by using two compatible plasmids at the same time. They also gave us some of their plasmid constructs for us to test what would be the minimum concentration for their project to be measurable.
