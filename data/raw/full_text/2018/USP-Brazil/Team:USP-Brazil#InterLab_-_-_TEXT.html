Interlab
The iGEM Interlab Project is the biggest interlaboratory studies in the world, and it is now on its fifth edition. This project aims to improve a protocol to measure fluorescence and minimize the variation between assays. Improved reproducibility will allow research groups to share data more safely. And to achieve this goal, our iGEM Team makes an effort to refine and test multiple protocols since 2016, trying to standardize every step, in a way that the results will be accurate regardless of the outside variables. This year, the focus was on improving the strategy to normalize the fluorescence by the population size. For that, teams around the globe compared the results of cell count utilizing two methods, the easier, using optical density (OD), and a more direct one, based on colony formation units (CFU).
We have worked with the devices made available by iGEM, and strictly followed the available protocols. The measurements were taken with a plate reader, and the results were sent to iGEM headquarters. The preliminary analysis showed that the results behaved as expected. Being that, we have successfully contributed to this year Interlab Study! Our team was happy to participate in this daring project, and our experience is further detailed below.
Calibration Procedures
Three calibration protocols were followed before the cell measurements, one for fluorescence setups and the others for optical density. The first was conducted using increasing concentrations of fluorescein, creating a standard fluorescence curve. The calibration for absorbance followed the same thought, but this time doing a standard curve using silica microspheres that resemble Escherichia coli cells. Together with a LUDOX analises, this can be successfully used to standardize OD measurements. Thus, this curves will help in the analysis of our data, by correcting the results and enable comparison.
Cell Measurements
The first step was to transform E.coli DH5α with the test devices provided by iGEM, which are listed below:

Two colonies with each of the devices were selected and grown overnight in liquid LB medium. They were used to make the inoculum on time 0 of the assay. Then, the cultures were incubated at 37°C and 220 rpm for 6 hours. An aliquot was taken from each colonie at timepoints 0h and 6h, which were used to do the OD and fluorescence measurements. The raw data we obtained are represented in the table below:

This step was necessary to calibrate our OD measurements with CFU counts, and with that, obtain a more reliable number of cells. First, we measured the absorbance of the overnight cultures from the two controls. Them, we diluted each one to a 0.1 OD in triplicate, and measure again. That value will be compared to the CFU counts from the same cultures. To obtain a countable number of colonies each inoculum was dillute  8 x 104, 8 x 105 and 8 x 106 times before being placed on an agar plate. The plates were incubated overnight and the number of colonies were computed and sent with our relatory.
