The Quorum Sensing Collection
Our collection of Quorum Sensing parts may very well be considered the apex of our 2018 project. As we set on a goal to improve the repertoire of available Quorum Sensing parts and to improve their characterization, we arrived at an extensive array of basic and composite parts. Many parts already existed on the Registry, with varying amounts of characterization information, but we decided to include them in our Quorum Sensing Collection as a way to centralize this information for future reference. We hope that this collection may be the cornerstone for innovative synthetic biology projects, which use quorum sensing (and bacterial communication as a whole) as circuit building tool.

Composite Parts
The Registryâ€™s range of quorum sensing-related composite part is simply massive. So we have selected a few that peaked our interest over the course of our project, and that may come in hand for future projects.
