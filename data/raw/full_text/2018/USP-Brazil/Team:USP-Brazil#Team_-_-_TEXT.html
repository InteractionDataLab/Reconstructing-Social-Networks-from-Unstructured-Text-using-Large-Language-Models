Team description
Hello iGEMers! We are the USP-Brazil team and we welcome you to our wiki.  The USP-Brazil team is formed by people of different areas like cellular biology, microbiology, molecular biology, ecology and developmental biology. All the members are from undergraduate or graduate courses of the University of São Paulo. The integration between members of different areas and different courses made us a highly interdisciplinary team and with that we were able to develop our project for the competition.

Henrique D'Ambrosio Retti
A.K.A Ocarina, I'm a very missbalanced character, kind-of in the last year of Biological Sciences. Very interested specially in theoretical works, like Mathematical Modelling, Evolutionary Ecology and Artificial Evolutionary Ecology :v The procrastination monster itself. See you at Giant Jamboree! Allons-Y! Alignment: Chaotic Good
Caio Gomes Tavares Rosa
Microbiologist in decay and comic relief of the team. Average in the right measure. I try my best in everything I do, but considering the amount of things, can't put much effort in any. The points that I did not put in intelligence and strength are in charisma. Great company for the delusions of life.

Felipe Buson Xavier
Hi! I'm Felipe, now three times iGEMer and Senior student of Biological Sciences and excited about genetic circuits ang videogames. After spending all of the last semester in the lab, I can't wait to learn more from everyone in this year's iGEM.

Andressa Flores Salvatierra
Hi, I'm Andressa, a final year undergraduate student pursuing my bachelor's in biological sciences. My academic interests include genomics, molecular biology and evolution of development. I love reading, especially when it's science related. I also enjoy music, Netflix, going out with friends and learning new languages. This is my first iGEM and I'm very excited for the Giant Jamboree!

Catharina Villaça
Hi, I'm Catharina, a last year Biomedical Sciences undergrad, perfectly average and fascinated by multifactorial diseases research. This is my first iGEM and I'm looking forward to meeting all of you! Great company when you need to chill.

Fabio Nunes de Mello
Third year Biomedical Sciences undergrad, third year iGEMer, serial procrastinator and academically not brilliant. Absolutely in love with molecular biology and synthetic biology, and hoping to finally graduate one day. I can also solve the Rubik's cube in three different languages, but not very fast.

Lucca Helmich
My name is Lucca. I'm currently in my first year of medical school, and I participated in the 2018 USP igem team as way of learning more about synthetic biology and molecular biology in general, an area in which I plan to do undergraduate research in.
Guilherme
First-year Biotechnology MSc Student and second year as an IGEMer! Engineering life and designing novel biological circuits are things that always keep me motivated! You can always find me in the lab.

Lucas dos Reis
Hi, I'm a 4th-year Biology student and I'm fascinated by molecular biology! The main focus of my entire research and academic formation are Eucaryotes but working on iGEM projects I can expand my knowledge to Bacterias. Every year iGEM competition provides me the opportunity to meet new people and develop different skills. That's awesome!
Lucas Yudi Nishida
Hi there! I'm in the third year of biomedical sciences and first year iGEMer. The fields I like the most are immunology and molecular biology. I'm really excited for the Giant Jamboree!

Vinicius Sousa Flores
Hello everyone! I'm Vinicius and this year I became a member of the team USP-Brazil for iGEM. I'm really excited to know everyone in the Giant Jamobree this year!
