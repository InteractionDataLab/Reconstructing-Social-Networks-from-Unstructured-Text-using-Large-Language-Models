As explained on our Project Design page, our work this year revolved around 12 base plasmids: 6 sender-receiver circuits and 6 promoter-reporter circuits. We have decided to not upload to the Registry all of our intermediates, as to not fill it with uninteresting parts that we have no data for. Instead, we have uploaded all of our 12 plasmids, with the associated relevant characterization, as well as the individual devices (constitutive LuxR, regulated TraI, and so on). As a lot of the basic parts already existed on the Registry, we have chosen to work with and upload modified versions of them, taken from the literature. For a full breakdown of our teamâ€™s parts (as well as grouping with other interesting quorum sensing parts), please visit our Collection of Parts page.
