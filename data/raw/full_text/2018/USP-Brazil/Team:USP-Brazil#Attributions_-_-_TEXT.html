The beginning of our project for this year was in February, in a meeting with the members of 2017 and the presence of new students interested in integrating the 2018 team. In the following meetings we decided the project and the name: QS-Comms. In July we started the development of the project in the laboratory, whilst the development of the other areas of the project like human practices, modelling and funding begun around May.
The name, visual identity and wiki design were done by the members of team USP-Brazil. The process was a rich contribution to our personal development, as it allowed people from diverse areas of interest to work on new things and gain experience, such as synthetic biology, programming and modelling, which of course would not have been possible without the help of all of our wonderful collaborators and sponsors.
Some members of our team, due to their university courses tough demands, couldn't contribute as much to the bulk of the project, but still deserve some attribution for the development of the project's ideas and designs, along with some help with modelling. Lots of thanks and hope you guys can work with us again in the following years,

Principal Investigators (PI)
We are really grateful for all the support Prof. Gisele Monteiro and Prof. Shaker Chuck Farah gave us. Both PIs contributed with the bureaucratic questions related to funding, laboratory space, reagents and equipments. The ideia of the project was proposed by the students and doesn’t present connection with the research being conducted in either laboratories. Nevertheless, both professors helped us with theoretical advice about the stages of the project.
Instructor and Advisor
Both advisor and instructor had a big importance in the development of the project. Gabriel Lovate was our instructor and helped us with the design of the DNA parts and project assembly. Henrique Pellin Biasoto was our advisor and helped a great deal in the laboratory experiments, and also gave important advices about microbiology and molecular biology.
Special Thanks
We want to once again express gratitude for all the people who helped us in this wonderful journey. The QS-Comms project was only able to exist because the help of many researchers, teachers and friends who gave us advice with many aspects of the project such as wiki, logo, visual identity, reagents, financial support from our university and many more.
