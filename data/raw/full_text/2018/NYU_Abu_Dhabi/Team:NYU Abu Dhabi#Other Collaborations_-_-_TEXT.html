Wiki Workshop
We collaborated with iGEM Team Linkoping Sweden in their Dear Diary initiative. We recorded interesting and fun things happened inside and outside the lab. We then sent it to Team Linkoping Sweden, who collected the diaries from each team and compiled them into a book/document. Through this initiative, we were able to showcase our excitement and interesting work for iGEM with the wider public.
We collaborated with iGEM Team IlT-Madras in their Language Project Initiative, aiding them in creating several synthetic biology educational videos in various languages. We received the English script of the video from IlT-Madras, translated in into different languages, as well as recording the audio of the script. Due to the diversity of our team, we were able to help them with 6 different language versions of the videos, namely, “Introduction to Synthetic Biology” in Mandarin, Bosnian, Korean, and “DNA and RNA” in Arabic.
Mandarin: Introduction to Synthetic Biology
Bosnian: Introduction to Synthetic Biology
Korean: Introduction to Synthetic Biology
We held a Wiki Workshop for our iGEM team that covers the basics of web development from HTML and CSS to Javascript. We also covered the basics of a good design, a good website, and a good visual identity. In addition to that, we went over the iGEM Wiki rules and resources.
All of our iGEM team were in attendance of this workshops in addition to a few members from iGEM VIT both over skype and in real life. Here are the contents of the workshop, that we want to make available to all iGEM teams in the future to make use of when creating their Wiki’s:
