We wanted to test how specific each of these amplification techniques is by running each plasmid with its primers and the primers of other fragments. Our results show that LAMP is the most specific amplification technique which is consistent with results from the literature that show that LAMP has very high specificity (1). PCR had the lowest specificity which is also consistent with results from literature (2). RPA has been shown to be the best amplification technique currently available in terms of parameters like speed, complexity, and user-friendliness. However, our results show that RPA is less specific than LAMP. Daher et al (2015) (3) showed that mismatches can occur if extra precautions are not taken during primer design to eliminate this. In our case, our primers could be the reason for RPA being less specific than LAMP.</H2><H2>We also tested how sensitive LAMP and PCR are by checking for the lowest concentration of DNA past which amplification is lost. We visualized amplification for both techniques by gel electrophoresis. We visualized the results for LAMP alone by adding SYBR green to the reaction post-amplification and visualizing with UV light. The results show that both LAMP and PCR have a similar sensitivity of up to 0.1 ng/μl of DNA. however, results from literature (4)(5) have shown that LAMP is significantly more sensitive than PCR. </H2><H2>As we would be using SYBR green in our device for visualization of amplification, we performed experiments to determine the optimal concentration of SYBR green to be added to our LAMP reaction and the wavelength of UV light that allows for the best visualization. We found that 1000X SYBR green in 25 μl total volume of LAMP reactants visualized with 254 nm UV light gave the best results.</H2><H2>To test if the results obtained from intra-lab amplification using miniprep DNA would work in our device which would use samples of putatively contaminated food or water, we tested detection of lmo0733 gene from Listeria Monocytogenes in beef. Ground beef was spiked with lmo0733 and E. Coli (as control for specificity) and direct swabs of prepared beef samples were used to run a LAMP reaction using NEB WarmStart colorimetric mastermix and lmo0733 primers. We observed a distinct yellow color in reactions with samples spiked with lmo0733 15 minutes after the reaction which confirms amplification; while samples from unspiked beef (negative control) and beef grown with E. Coli remained bright red. Gel electrophoresis was also used to confirm the results of the colorimetric amplification.</H2><H4><CENTER><U>Results</U></CENTER></H4><H4><INS>PCR</INS></H4><H2>PCR reactions were run with designed primers to confirm that the primers amplify the gene of interest and also characterize the DNA fragments we would be working with. The agarose gel (1%) shows bands at expected lengths for lmo0733 (430 bp), gbpA (1019 bp) and invA (818 bp). The negative controls show no bands i.e. no amplification which is what was expected.
PCR reactions were run to test the specificity of the primers for this technique. Each gene was run with its primers and the primers of other gene fragments
</H2><H5><I>Sensitivity (lmo0773, invA and hipO)</I></H5><H2>In order to determine the PCR reaction sensitivity, the reaction was run with serial dilutions of miniprepped plasmid with the gene of interest. The reactions were set up according to an optimized protocol used in the laboratory.
</H2><H2><CENTER><I>Figure 1. Agarose gels (1%) corresponding to the PCR reaction with serial dilutions of miniprepped lmo0773, invA and hipO DNA. (a). lmo0773 serial dilutions 363 ng/µl, 200 ng/µl, 100 ng/µl, 50 ng/µl, 25 ng/µl, 10 ng/µl, 1 ng/µl, 0.5 ng/µl, 0.1 ng/µl. (b). invA serial dilutions 295.5 ng/µl, 200 ng/µl, 100 ng/µl, 50 ng/µl, 25 ng/µl, 10 ng/µl, 1 ng/µl, 0.5 ng/µl, 0.1 ng/µl. (c). hipO serial dilutions 159.8 ng/µl, 100 ng/µl, 50 ng/µl, 25 ng/µl, 10 ng/µl, 1 ng/µl, 0.5 ng/µl, 0.1 ng/µl
</I></CENTER></H2><H2>Results obtained clearly shows that PCR is sensitive up to 0.1 ng/µl, lowest concentration tested, for all three plasmids tested. Visually, all bands appear to be similarly thick, which shows that, despite the changes in concentration, PCR amplified each DNA in a similar manner.
</H2><H2>Published research has reported PCR to be sensitive up to 3 pg/µl (6). This shows that PCR is a sensitive technique that is able to amplify DNA even at low DNA concentrations.
</H2><H5><I>Specificity  (lmo0773, invA and gbpA)</I></H5><H2>Two sets of experiments were carried out to test the specificity of each amplification technique used.  In the first set of experiments, the genes used were kept constant, while the primers were varied, while in the second set, the primers were kept constant while the genes were varied. As can be seen in the figure below, PCR was not found to be specific, as the DNA for a specific gene was amplified by primers designed for another gene as well as with primers specific for that gene.

</I></CENTER></H2><H5><I>SYBR Green Optimization</I></H5><H2>SYBR Green was used to visualize amplification of miniprep DNA in the presence of UV light. 1 ul of SYBR Green was added to 25 ul of LAMP reactants (using NEB Master Mix, designed primers, &amp; miniprep DNA for positive controls and water for negative controls). The samples were visualized at different wavelengths of UV light to determine the optimal wavelength for visualization and to optimize the concentration of SYBR Green in 25 ul of LAMP reactants.

The <I>gbpA</I> gene was amplified using the LAMP method and fluorescence was detected in the positive sample at UV 254 nm as well as under blue light. The negative control showed background fluorescence, possibly due to the addition of primers or as a result of the SYBR Green itself. However, a clear distinction in fluorescence was observed.

A sample of untreated store-bought beef was prepared alongside a sample of DH5-alpha cells transformed with the lmo0733 gene from <I>Listeria Monocytogenes</I>. Direct swabs were taken from each sample and used in the LAMP reactions. Reactions lacking the target gene appear a bright red colour whereas reaction mixes containing the amplified gene appear salmon to yellow in colour.

</I></CENTER></H2><H2>Both the visual colorimetric results immediately following and 15 minutes after the reaction show the treated sample of beef as having a distinctly lighter colour than the other two unamplified samples. The gel electrophoresis confirms the amplification of the <I>lmo0733</I> gene from the whole swabbed bacterial cells and no amplification in samples without the target gene, assuring LAMP’s specificity. </H2><H5><I>LAMP Sensitivity (lmo0773, invA and hipO)</I></H5><H2>In order to determine the LAMP reaction sensitivity, the reaction was run with serial dilutions of miniprepped plasmid with the gene of interest. The reactions were set up according to Optigene or NEB LAMP kit protocols.
</H2><H2><CENTER><I>Figure 12.

</I></CENTER></H2><H2>The sensitivity test corroborated that LAMP is a sensitive technique that can detect the DNA up to very small concentrations. Results obtained show that <I>lmo0773</I> and <I>hipO</I> plasmids are sensitive up to 0.1 ng/µl, while <I>invA</I> plasmid is sensitive up to 0.5 ng/µl. Visually the amplification is comparably visible for all concentrations for <I>lmo0773</I> and <I>hipO</I> plasmids, with miniprepped plasmid band being visible up to 25 ng/µl for all plasmids. The <I>invA</I> plasmid seems to not be as sensitive, however, as the literature reports LAMP to be sensitive up to 33 ng/µl, it is very likely that the <I>invA</I> plasmid is an outlier (6). The sensitivity of <I>invA</I> plasmid could have been affected by the improper set up of the reaction e.g. inaccurate serial dilutions, mistakes in the protocol, etc. Therefore, the test showed that LAMP is a good alternative technique, which is comparably sensitive to PCR.
</H2><H2>In order to determine if visualization will be possible with the SYBR Green fluorescent dye even at low DNA concentrations, a LAMP reaction was run with <I>hipO</I> plasmid serial dilutions with 1 µl of 1000x SYBR Green dye added into the 25 µl LAMP reaction. Additional negative controls were included, such as SYBR Green + water and SYBR Green, water + <I>hipO</I> primers to determine the background fluorescence.
</H2><H2><CENTER><I>Figure 13. The SYBR Green fluorescence of the <I>hipO</I> serial dilutions represented under <B>(a)</B> UV light (365 nm) <B>(b)</B> Blue light <B>(c)</B> under Blue light with overexposure demonstrates.
</I></CENTER></H2><H2>The fluorescence results under UV and Blue light confirmed that the reaction can be visualized up to 0.1 ng/µl. Under UV light you can clearly see the difference between positive and negative controls. There is also a trend of decreasing fluorescence with decreasing plasmid concentration with the highest fluorescence at 172.5 ng/µl and lowest at 0.1 ng/µl. This is corroborated by the reaction vessels under the Blue light, which show the same trend. The overexposure option of visualization under the Blue light allows to show that even at 0.1 ng/µl there is more fluorescence than the background fluorescence present in the negative controls. Therefore, this test shows that even at low concentrations the SYBR Green is effective at showing the successful DNA amplification.
</H2><H5><I>LAMP Specificity (lmo0773, invA and gbpA)</I></H5><H2>The same two experiments done with PCR were done with LAMP. The results obtained indicate that LAMP is highly specific as every gene was only amplified by its primers and not by any other primers. LAMP was found to be the only completely specific technique out of PCR, LAMP and RPA.

The amounts of reagents in the protocol stated for 50 ul were brought down proportionally and the reactions genes were amplified successfully as shown in the agarose gel (3%) images.  The reactions were run with miniprepped plasmid with the gene of interest. Optimization of RPA reactions to lower volumes helped save RPA reagents in the experiments as well as in the microfluidic chips used for the amplification of pathogens in the Pathogene device.

</I></CENTER></H2><H2>The results obtained show that RPA is sensitive up to 0.1 ng/µl for both <I>lmo0773</I> and <I>hipO</I> plasmids. Visually both plasmids have a clear amplification band that is comparable at all concentrations. The negative controls do not contain the specific amplicon band for either of the plasmids. The hipO plasmid has a smear at lower weight boundaries, however, it can be explained by the primer dimerization. Therefore, the test showed that RPA is an alternative technique that is comparably sensitive to PCR and LAMP.
</H2><H5><I>Specificity</I></H5><H2>The two specificity experiments were done with RPA for the two genes, <I>lmo0733</I> and <I>invA</I>. The results shown in the Figure below, show that RPA is not as specific as LAMP as amplification of a gene with primers designed for another gene does occur. This could be due to the fact that RPA uses the longest primers out of all three techniques, resulting in a higher possibility of having regions of the primers complementary to different genes.

Its current version provides a small form factor that may be further reduced. Sample collection is done by brushing the sterile cotton swab against a sample. The device contains a sterile watertight chamber for TE buffer solution for safe transportation and use. This chamber is sealed with a thin watertight film that maintains the liquid in the chamber until it is needed. A funnel maintains the film in place through pressure with the use of three screws. Once sample collection occurs, TE buffer is released through the press of a plunger, which the funnel guides into the cotton swab with the sample. The sample is washed out of the cotton by the flow of liquid. A lid may be used to direct the liquid flow directly into the microfluidic chip inlet, making the transition between sample collection and sample preparation seamless. </H2><H2>The sample collector is currently manufactured with 3D printed PLA with the exception of the sterile cotton tip swab and the plunger retrieved from standard 10 ml medical syringes. It uses two O-rings (at the base of the sample collector and funnel) to ensure water tightness. The current unit cost of materials and chemicals is $2.89 USD but can be further reduced with design optimization and mass production.

There are three modes for the device: in the first mode, the
green LED light lights up, signaling that the power is connected. The 6 blue LED lights that aids visualization will also be on. In the second mode (for RPA reaction), one red LED light turns on, and the heating board heats up to 40&amp;deg C. In the third mode (for LAMP reaction), two red LED lights turn on and the heating board heats up to 65&amp;deg C. A temperature sensor is closely attached to the heating board and helps ensure that the temperature is maintained as desired. A power bank that consists of a 9V rechargeable battery is used as the power supply for the device. The user can just connect the power bank to the device for the device to start operating.

Final Heating Device Prototype</I></CENTER></H2><H4><CENTER><U>The Microfluidics</U></CENTER></H4><H2>The microfluidic chip provides chambers for each LAMP/RPA reaction to occur. The chip is designed to have a circular shape with a small a small inlet in the middle. The inlet is connected by 600um width channels to 10 different reaction wells. DNA will then be amplified in each reaction well to determine the presence of harmful pathogens within the food sample. The chip is made with a hydrophilic film and double-sided tape to reduce cost and ensure that the food sample flows easily to each reaction chamber. The material used for this chip has a significantly lower cost compared to the conventionally used PDMS chip. Compared to the method of using silicon mold used to create PDMS chip, Pathogene’s chip is laser cut also contributing toward low production cost. It also has a longer shelf-life and is more stable compared to paper microfluidic chips. With this chip, users are able to expect reliable results with reduced cost.

As such, before building the device and integrating engineering and biology, each biological reaction was tested and the engineering working principles were verified and documented. More details on the process and tests themselves may be found in <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:NYU_Abu_Dhabi/Biology">the biology</A> and <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:NYU_Abu_Dhabi/Engineering">the engineering</A> lab notebooks. </H2><H4><CENTER><U>Sample Collector</U></CENTER></H4><H2>When a sterile cotton bud is used to collect a real life sample, amplification of the target gene and thus presence of the subject pathogen can be colorimetrically visualised in normal light conditions. Immediately after the LAMP reaction with WarmStart Colorimetric Mastermix is completed, there is a notably lighter appearance to the reaction tube containing the transformed bacteria with the target gene (<I>lmo0733</I>). On the other hand, the sample of uncontaminated beef and the negative control remain a bright red colour, the difference is more noticeable 15 minutes after the reaction. The gel electrophoresis confirms the amplification that occured. This set of experiments provides evidence that LAMP results can be visualised on real food samples with bacterial cells and not only on purified DNA samples. </H2><H2><CENTER><I>Figure 1.

</I></CENTER></H2><H2>The film was tested if it was hydrophilic enough to ensure good flow of liquid. When roughly testing wells and channels made only from the chip, it showed that the film is hydrophilic enough for liquid to flow without pressure. </H2><H2><CENTER><I>Figure 8. Testing flow of liquid in the 3M film chip
</I></CENTER></H2><H2>Confirming the hydrophilicity of the chip, a prototype made from double sided tape and film was tested. The chip had a channel width of 200µm, which is a conventional width for PDMS microfluidic chip. However, the liquid did not flow to the wells. Through varying different width of the microfluidic chip, we realized that maximizing the surface area exposed to the hydrophilic film is more important than varying surface pressure of the wells. The finalized chip had a 600µm width to ensure good flow but prevent flowback. </H2><H4><CENTER><U>Amplification</U></CENTER></H4><H2>The reagents for two positive as well as two negative  NEB LAMP reactions were added to four different wells on PDMS chip. Each reaction contained 12.5µl of mastermix, 9µl of water and 1µl of miniprep DNA. Positive control reactions contained 2.5µl of primers, while in negative control reactions, the same volume of water was added instead. After the reagents were added to the chip, it was covered with hydrophobic PCR tape in order to prevent evaporation of the reagents throughout the reactions.The reactions were then run for 30 minutes by placing the chip on a hot plate heated to a temperature of 65°C. Figure 1 shows the chip as viewed under blue light. The wells containing positive are marked with a + symbol while the negative controls are marked with a - symbol.

</I></CENTER></H2><H2>Next, the four RPA reactions were carried out in a 3M chip. For one RPA reaction, 29.5µl of re-hydration buffer was added to one tube of dried reaction, along with 2.4µl forward primers, 2,4 µl backward primers, 8.2µl of water, 5µl of DNA, 1µl of 1000X SBYR Green and 2.5µl of Magnesium acetate. The primers were replaced with an equal volume of water for the two negative control reactions.

The reactions were run in PCR tubes at 65°C for 30 minutes. The completed reactions were then pipetted into the wells of a ten-well PDMS chip, alternating between positive and negative.
</H2><H2>
The objective of this was to ensure that fluorescence could be observed in the PDMS chip under blue light. Moreover, this was done to illustrate the difference in fluorescence between positive and negative controls.
