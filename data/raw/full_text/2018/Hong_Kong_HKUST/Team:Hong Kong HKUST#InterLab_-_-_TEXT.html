OUR INTERLAB OBJECTIVES
The iGEM Interlab 2018 aims to reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements that were shown in previous interlab studies which use an optical density (O.D.) as the normalization method of fluorescence. Since O.D. is an approximation of cell number, the interlab this year attempts to address the problem by two orthogonal approaches. Hypothesized that silica beads have similar light scattering properties as the cells due to their similarities in size and shape, one of the approaches is to convert the absorbance of cells to the absorbance of a known concentration of silica beads [1]. Adopting a more direct normalization method, the other approach is to normalize the absorbance of cells by absolute cell counts or colony-forming units (CFU).
Method:
All procedures were performed according to the given iGEM protocol [2], except that the O.D. measurement setting was changed from OD600 to OD595, due to the limited options of plate reader in HKUST.  After further discussion with the iGEM headquarter, we retained the data to be OD595.

Fig.3b Fluorescein standard curve (log scale) The non-linear fluorescence standard curve is conjectured to be a result of detector over-saturation. This could be inferred from a linear curve at low concentrations of fluorescein while reaching plateau at high concentrations.

Conclusion:
There is no significant difference in the pattern of normalized fluorescence values between using O.D. and particle count, as illustrated in Figure 4 and 5. The normalized fluorescence values of the devices are consistent with their respective promoter strengths, with device 1 (BBa_J23101) as the highest fluorescence value (i.e. 1791 a.u.) and device 3 (BBa_J23117) as the lowest fluorescence value (i.e. 162 a.u.). However, cell quantification by colony-forming units failed to reproduce the modeled cell concentration by silica beads. This may conclude that the two methods, CFU cell count and silica beads, may not be able to produce a consistent value of cell concentration.
