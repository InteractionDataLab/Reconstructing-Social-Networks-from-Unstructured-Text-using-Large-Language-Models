BBa_K2764000
The gene alkL codes for the outer membrane alkane channel protein known as AlkL. Derived from Pseudomonas Oleovarans, the sequence of 693bp has already been codon optimized for an E.coli chassis. The AlkL is able to collect alkanes thanks to an extracellular domain that has a high binding affinity to hydrophobic molecules. Once collected, the alkane makes it way through the hydrophobic core of AlkL before exiting into the periplasm through a small lateral opening in the protein. Hence, the AlkL, which penetrates the lipopolysaccharide outer membrane, may allow alkanes of larger molecular size to enter the cell.

From literature, we know that the AlkL protein is toxic. As such, we used Anderson promoters of different strength to determine which expression level would be optimal. The Anderson promoters selected were J23104, J23107 and J23110 were intended to form an expression level gradient for this purpose.
