We formed our team and had a meeting about safety training in laboratory.
Week 1
Wet lab
We conducted the Interlab experiment.
Week 2
Dry lab
According to the purpose of our project, we designed our parts by using Snapgene. Then, we chose Gibson assembly to synthesize them, for which we also designed some primers.
Week 3 ~ Week 9
Wet lab
We amplified our interest gene fragment through PCR and constructed the plasmids. Then we transformed them into DH5α to proceed amplification. Then, we did colony PCR to find positive clones. We extracted the plasmid from this kind of bacteria and checked them by gel electrophoresis. After the result accorded with our prediction, we sent it to a company to sequence them.
Human Practice
In the sixth week, we applicated for WeChat public address and published the first article about the introduction of our team. Then, we applicated the official Twitter. In the next week, we finished the design of our logo and searched for some information about hydrogen oxygen fuel cell. In the eighth and ninth week, we visited Bluepha company to get some information about oxygen demand in fermenter and tidied up it.
Dry lab
We designed the modeling part and did paper research for relative information.
Week 10
Wet lab
We transformed our plasmids into bacteria after we got the right sequencing results.
Human Practice
We designed a questionnaire about the genetically modified food to know people’s understanding of it.
Dry lab
We confirmed the direction of modeling and built the function about the influence of VHb on the useful oxygen concentration.
Week 11
Wet lab
When bacteria were amplificated, we observed the fluorescence of the transformed bacteria under the super resolution microscope and test the growth ability such as growth curve and CDW of our interest bacteria.
Dry lab
We did paper research and built the function about the influence of useful oxygen concentration on the growth efficiency of bacteria.
Week 12
Wet lab
We kept observing the fluorescence of the transformed bacteria under the super resolution microscope and testing the growth ability such as growth curve and CDW of our interest bacteria.
Human Practice
We gained the result of our questionnaire and found that we should give a presentation to spread the knowledge of this subject. So, we made the posters about this presentation and put up it in our school.
Dry lab
We did paper research and built the function about the influence of protein expression on the growth efficiency of bacteria.
Collaboration
We prepared for Northern China Highschool iGEMers’ MEETUP.
Week 13
Wet lab
We kept observing the fluorescence of the transformed bacteria under the super resolution microscope and testing the growth ability such as growth curve and CDW of our interest bacteria.
Human Practice
We gave a speech about synthetic biology in our school and collected students’ comment of our presentation by using questionnaire.
Dry lab
We optimized our functions and used MATLAB to do the calculation.
Week 14
Wet lab
We observed the fluorescence they sent out and the growth ability by using microscope.
Human Practice
We wrote the report about the result of our questionnaire (the one which is about genetically modified food) and published it on our WeChat public address.
Team stuff
We designed the ladder of our team.
Week 15
Collaboration
We gave a presentation at Northern China Highschool iGEMers’ MEETUP, communicated with other teams in Beijing and discussed biosafety at that meeting. Besides, we also had a collaboration with BNU china.
Human Practice
We wrote our article about all the information of our Human practice and published them on our WeChat public address.
Wiki
We designed the picture we would use on our wiki.
Team stuff
We made our uniforms.
