At present, one way to solve this problem is to leverage the technology of high-cell-density growth, and the key factor limiting cell density in bioreactors is <B>the availability of oxygen</B> during the late phases of fermentation<SUP title="Guoqiang Chen. New challenges and opportunities for industrial biotechnology. Microb Cell Fact.11(2012)">[1]</SUP>.</FONT></P><P style="line-height:30px"><FONT size="4">Compared with oxygen dissolved in pure water, the solubility of oxygen is significantly reduced in fermentation broth due to the presence of various dissolved nutrients, inorganic salts and metabolites of microorganisms. In addition, the concentration of dissolved oxygen varies with temperature, pressure and salt. In general, the higher the temperature, the more salt dissolved, the lower the dissolved oxygen in the water; The higher the pressure, the higher the dissolved oxygen in the water.</FONT></P></H2><H2>Factors that affect the oxygen content in the fermentation process.</H2><P style="line-height:30px"><FONT size="4">At present, the lack of oxygen in the fermentation process is mainly caused by the following two factors.</FONT></P><P style="line-height:30px"><FONT size="4"><B>1. The insufficient dissolved oxygen in the medium.</B> Dissolved oxygen refers to the dissolved oxygen in the molecular state of water. Since oxygen is undissolved gas, under the condition of normal pressure, 25 ℃, oxygen solubility in the water in the air is only about 0.25 tendency for L. Therefore, if the outside world cannot supply oxygen in time during the fermentation process, the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water can only maintain a very short period of normal respiration of the bacteria, it will be exhausted. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly introduce sterile air into the fermentation system and further disperse it by stirring in the fermentation tank, so as to maintain a moderate concentration of dissolved oxygen in the fermentation liquid, but sometimes it is still unable to meet the oxygen demand of fermentation production. With the increase of fermentation tank volume, the raw material and power consumption of the fermentation process have increased to a large extent, and the demand for oxygen is also increasing<SUP title="Mingya LI,Chenshui Lin.Ice crystal nucleoprotein and its application in bacteria surface display technology. Amino acids and biological resources (2016) 38(2) : 7-11">[3]</SUP>.</FONT></P><P style="line-height:30px"><FONT size="4"><B>2. The uneven distribution of oxygen in the fermentation tank</B>, which is mainly affected by the oxygen transfer rate. Oxygen is dissolved in water by air and then transferred to the surface of the cells of the bacteria, where it is eventually used. In this process, oxygen transfers resistance mainly includes gas membrane resistance, liquid membrane resistance, mass transfer resistance of cell membrane, etc., which greatly reduces the utilization rate of cell to oxygen.</FONT></P><H2>The limitations and recent methods to increase the oxygen usage in the fermentation process </H2><P style="line-height:30px"><FONT size="4"><B>1. Reduce the temperature of the medium or the content of nutrients in the medium, or to increase the oxygen partial pressure in the fermentation tank</B>. However, these methods have many limitations. The temperature and nutrients of fermentation medium are determined according to the physiological characteristics of the stains, so they cannot be changed at will. Although the increase of tank pressure increases the oxygen partial pressure, thereby increasing the solubility of oxygen, it also increases the partial pressure of other gases, such as carbon dioxide, and the solubility of carbon dioxide is much higher than that of oxygen, which is not conducive to the fermentation.</FONT></P><P style="line-height:30px"><FONT size="4"><B>2. Increasing the amount of ventilation in the fermentation tank.</B>However, the amount of dissolved oxygen has a certain upper limit at a certain temperature and pressure. Excessive increase of ventilation will result in a large amount of gas not dispersed, directly through the mixer in the form of large bubble rise, stirring power will be greatly reduced. It may also increase the burden of air filters and the possibility of contamination. Morever, the increase of stirring power is limited to a certain extent. Excessive stirring will produce great shear force, resulting in inactivation of microbial species and products. In addition, too much stirring power will also lead to uneconomical system operation and waste of resources.</FONT></P><P class="text-center" style="line-height:30px"><FONT size="4.5"><B>Therefore，a new method to increase the low-oxygen condition tolerant ability of the engineering bacteria is of great importance.</B></FONT></P><H2><I>Vitreoscilla</I> hemoglobin(VHb) are well used to the oxygen usage ability of bacteria.</H2><P style="line-height:30px"><FONT size="4"> Hemoglobin is not only existed in vertebrate blood but appears in almost all living organisms, including vertebrates, invertebrates, higher plants, algae, fungi and bacteria. <I>Vitreoscilla</I> is a kind of obligate aerobic gram-negative bacteria living in an environment that lacks of oxygen, such as rotting plant material, cow dung, flooded rice paddies and stagnant ponds.

Under the condition of poor oxygen, VHb can improve the dissolved oxygen utilization ability of bacteria, and can improve the cell oxygen transfer efficiency. Therefore, the expression of VHb can satisfy the requirement of respiration and help the bacteria adapt to the low dissolved oxygen levels, thus can promote the growth and metabolism of cells, improving the yield of desired products. Therefore, it has a good application prospect in genetic engineering and fermentation engineering. Currently, the gene (vgb) that encodes VHb has been cloned and sequenced, and has been expressed in multiple kinds of hosts.
