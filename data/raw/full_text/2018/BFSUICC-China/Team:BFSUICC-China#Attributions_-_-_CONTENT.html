She is my leader, and our job contact with other, and being a spy, because we went to the swimming pool got few samples for our lab. Also, we are responsible for presentation, such as the presentation between teams and teams, and we went to high school to the publicity the synthetic biology to students who interested in synthetic biology. That is a good chance for us to practice our speaking skill, and I’m very happy to participate in IGEM, hope sees you guys in Boston.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align="center"> </P><BLOCKQUOTE><P align="center"><SPAN class="style7">Tina:</SPAN> I was mainly responsible for human practice in the team, and my main job was to contact other teams and discuss our experimental plans and deficiencies. For example, in the initial stage of iGEM, we contacted students who had participated in iGEM before and asked them to tell us some experience and give us some valuable advice. This time, we learned a lot. At the same time, I and other students in charge of human practice will also go to other schools through WeChat or iGEM publicity. We went to a high school in Beijing to let students who were interested in synthetic biology know about iGEM. In this process, I think the biggest difficulty we encountered was how to contact other teams, how to adjust the time overlap between iGEM and learning. Through participating in this iGEM, I learned how to allocate my spare time, and I was very happy to meet many people with the same interests.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align="center"> </P><BLOCKQUOTE><P align="center"><SPAN class="style7">Clarance: </SPAN>I am mainly in charge of editing Wiki, which requires some basic knowledge about HTML5, that was what I had been told but the truth was far more “interesting” than that, I also need to acquire JavaScript. Well at first, I had lots of passion for learning how to create a website, but as I dug in, I became very desperate. I was far more completed than I thought. Therefore, I went out computer science teaches to ask for help. Because I don’t take computer science at school so my knowledge on either HTML5 or JavaScript were all from the internet which is not always correct and accurate. Our teacher, Mr Anton is a very patient man, he was very willing to teach me. Creating a good and nice website is a time consuming and a hard skill to learn. It is my first time ever to design a website so please, forgive me if there are many defects and mistake.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align="center"> </P><P align="center"><SPAN class="style7">Lynn:</SPAN> 1.Taking note of team conference
