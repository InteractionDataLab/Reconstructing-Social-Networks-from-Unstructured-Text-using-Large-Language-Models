Host Northern China High School Meet Up
On October 4, to prepare for the upcoming Giant Jamboree, our centre has hosted high school teams in Northern China have met. Meet up information was posted on the iGEM website in advance.
Firstly, at the beginning of the meeting, our team members Sally and Celina gave a welcome speech. Secondly, each team has a presentation. The instructors judge these projects and give valuable advice to these teams. Finally, we share our experiences each other. We also discuss how to improve our projects and how to do better in the next year.
With CIEI-BJ
2018 CIEI-BJ
In summer vacation, we participated in a meet up hosted by CIEI-BJ. We knew many iGEM members of the different team, such as BIT-China, USTBeijing and CIEI-BJ. Each team has done a presentation. Our team instructor Mary du has given valuable comments and advice for these team. Meanwhile, we receive some advice from the instructor Arya Qu of CIEI-BJ and other instructors. We focus on Implementation of experimental plan.
After that, we often communicate with the members of CIEI-BJ through Wechat or telephone. During our experiment, we need to use plate reader to measure fluorescent intensity and OD 600.   During CIEI-BJ experiment, they need to use chromatograph to measure the amount of aflatoxin。We discuss the Instrument usage and procedure together In addition to this，Mary Du often communicate with Arya Qu about part requirement, part submission, wiki editing and so on.
Communication promotes the development of the project, adds a lot of fun to the preparation of the project, and we have been friends.

Report
In Mar, 29th, 2018, the leader of RDFZ-China team Bowen, Xiao came to International Course Centre of Beijing Foreign Studies University, and had an excited and impressive report on us
Bowen illustrated his experience of participating in iGEM for two years. He summarized his experience into three phases: self-study, perfection and creation. He gave us some tips about the circumference of self-study and introduced two books on synthetic biology for us. He emphasized that HTML to program WIKI is an essential skill for us to master. In addition, he briefly described his team’s project and other teams. This is very useful for us during the progress of preparing the iGEM project.
He indicated that the biggest problem his team had, is the uneven distribution of task last year. He suggested us that we should prepare the knowledge for the project before carrying out any experiment. He also mentioned that each team member should be more proactive for high efficiently preparing iGEM project. He believed that iGME provides a great communicating platform for students with the common interest to make friends. It is possible to meet your new friends in the Jamboree next year. This lets us deeply understand how to do an iGEM project.
After the presentation, we had happy communication. Someone asked: What were some problems you had? He answered: The biggest problem he had is the resource and not enough time for the experiment. We discussed how to design the part and device, analyze the results of the experiment. We all harvest a lot of new knowledge, which is crucial for us to apply and practice. Bowen introduced a Wechat number for communication to students of iGEM teams. We can communicate with more members of iGEM teams.
Communication
On September 16th I have a meeting with the leader of RDFZ-China. We have a little presentation just to share the basic information about our project. Then I ask some question about Jamboree and got a very useful information. I believe that can give me a better understanding of whole iGEM competition. This may give our team a better result. All in all, great thanks to RDFZ-China which helps us a lot.
