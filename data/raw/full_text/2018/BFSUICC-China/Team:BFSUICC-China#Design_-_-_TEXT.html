Design
We aim to detect the concentration of copper ion in  the water. According to our goal, we design a circuit    which can improve previous copper detection  system to make it efficient and  intelligent.
 
 
Circuit
The  design of BBa_K2555002
We design two basic parts to form a whole system, sensor  part and regulator part:
 
 
 
Sensor Part
The  design of BBa_K2555000 (optimum BBa_K1555000)
 
 
Previous part BBa_K1555000 in the registry
 
Escherichia  coli has high  tolerance for copper. CopA is the central component of copper homeostasis in E.  coli, which removes Copper ions from the cytosol into  the periplasm (Stoyanov  et al .,2001). CopA is required for intrinsic copper resistance (Outten et al.,2000).  The promoter of cop A is more sensitive to copper than  the other two copper-responsive promoter. So, we use this promoter in our  sensor part. Moreover, we add RiboJ between promoter and RBS of previous Part  BBa_K1555000. RiboJ is an insulator commonly used in genetic circuits to  prevent unexpected interactions between neighboring parts. Insulation with  RiboJ may increase protein abundance. We replace GFP to sfGFP. The  investigation has found that sfGFP increased resistance to denaturation,  improved folding kinetics, increased resistance to aggregation during  refolding(Andrews et al., 2007), and  was very useful for improved protein detection(Cabantous et al., 2006).
 
Regulator Part
The  design of BBa_K2555002
In the absence of metal ,the metalloregulator  CueR bends the DNA so that the RNA polymerase cannot interact with the pCopA  promoter properly, thereby repressing transcription (Outten et al., 1999). Upon  metal coordination, CueR enables the DNA to assume a conformation that can  activate the transcription process. CueR can behave as a net activator or a net  repressor under different copper concentrations through interaction with RNA  polymerase.( Danya J et al., 2015). We link L-arabinose inducing promoter-pBAD  and CueR together. We can control the amount of Cue R expression though adding  different concentration of arabinose.
 
 
The design of BBa_K2555003
BBa_K2555003 is used  to indirectly reflect the expression of cueR of BBa_K2555002 under different  concentration of L-arabinose by measuring green fluorescent intensity with  plate reader.
