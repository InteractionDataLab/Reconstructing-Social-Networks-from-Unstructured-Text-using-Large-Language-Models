        I major in molecular biology and have received a doctorate degree from The Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and published a paper about UV radiation-responsive proteins in rice leaves by proteomic analysis in the academic journal:Plant Cell and Physiology. The iGEM competition is interesting for me and my students. The process of preparing for the competition was hard, but funny, and exciting for us. It improved the ability of our students and promoted friendship between them. 
        Team idea <P>During the early stage,  nearly all members of our team came up with multiple ideas about synthetic biology. Many of them are devoted to the improvement or protection of the environment. Others focus  on drug developement. Finally, after many discussions, we conclude that Tina’s project about copper detection is more practical and easy to implement. So our team focus its dedication to studying improvement of copper detection.</P></SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P class="style1"> </P><P class="style1"> </P><P> </P><TABLE width="200" border="1" align="center"><TBODY><TR><TH height="23" class="style6" scope="col"> Members</TH></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P> </P><P> </P><TABLE width="1027" border="4" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TBODY><TR><TD width="374" height="132"><DIV align="justify"><SPAN class="style7">Hi.

        My favorite thing is spend whole day at home and keep doing something crazy rarely.

The reason for me to participate in IGEM this time is that I have been interested in biology since my childhood, and I want to know more about biology in my spare time. I hope that I can make more friends and learn more about biology in this study and exchange activity.</DIV></TD><TD width="270"><SPAN class="style7">My name is Wang Chenxi, and English name is Clarence, born in august 24, 2002.

I have always considered as a science student, which is also the reason why I dropped economics after one year of working, and chose to be study biology as a new subject. It seems that books and basketball will always follow me in school-a bottle of water as well, but the main thing I do back home is to focus on improving my knowledge of different aspects.  There are two reasons why I have become one part of our iGEM team: recommendation from my friends, and my preference to this project. I have then become a part of the Wiki team, which means I had to learn HTML5 and JavaScript. Even though it is a hard time, but I am still glad I got over through it.  PS：Little wish, I want to grown up to 185cm, and reduce my weight to 70kg. God bless me. </P></SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P class="style1"> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
