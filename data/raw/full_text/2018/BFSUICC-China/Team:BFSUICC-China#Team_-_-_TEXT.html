Since the beginning of the January, 2018, along the join of the two new team members and some new arrangements were made, our team has dedicated to the theoretical knowledge and experimental practice. On this page, you can find some information about all the members that have contributed to the experiments we have done. Furthermore, we give the greatest appreciation to our instructor who guided us to proceed series complicated experiments.

Hello!
I major in molecular biology and have received a doctorate degree from The Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and published a paper about UV radiation-responsive proteins in rice leaves by proteomic analysis in the academic journal:Plant Cell and Physiology. The iGEM competition is interesting for me and my students. The process of preparing for the competition was hard, but funny, and exciting for us. It improved the ability of our students and promoted friendship between them.
Team idea
During the early stage,  nearly all members of our team came up with multiple ideas about synthetic biology. Many of them are devoted to the improvement or protection of the environment. Others focus  on drug developement. Finally, after many discussions, we conclude that Tina’s project about copper detection is more practical and easy to implement. So our team focus its dedication to studying improvement of copper detection.

Hi. My name’s Sally. I’m a grade 11 student and I’m the leader of the BFSUICC-China. My major job is doing experiment and preparing the essay of our team.
My favorite thing is spend whole day at home and keep doing something crazy rarely. Because in my view human brain would be so tired if it keeps doing thing alright,                   so being crazy is a good way to relax.
Hello, everyone. My name is wang yuyao.，English name is Tom I am an 11th-grade student from BFSU-ICC. I am interested in equestrian. I am now studying a-level major in computer and economics. The reason for me to participate in IGEM this time is that I have been interested in biology since my childhood, and I want to know more about biology in my spare time. I hope that I can make more friends and learn more about biology in this study and exchange activity.
My name is Wang Chenxi, and English name is Clarence, born in august 24, 2002. Grew up in Beijing. Currently I am studying in Beijing Foreign Studies University International Curriculum Center (BFSU ICC). Major subjects studied in school are biology and chemistry, but I am not very good at any of those. Beside riding bike and playing basketball, I don’t have any other hobbies. In the university I want to major in medicine or any subjects that are related to biology.
 
 
Hi, I am Tianyan Zhao and English name is Tina. I am from Beijing Foreign Studies University--ICC. This year is my first time to participate in iGEM. I am mainly responsible for Human paractice in the team. Usually I prefer sports, such as playing basketball. I think only sports can eliminate fatigut and bring motivation. This time, I am very happy to form an iGEM team with the school leaders. I hope we can cherish the process and enjoy the results.
I’m an international student in BFSUICC. Although I’m not studying biology, the knowledge of neuroscience and genetic engineering has a great attraction on me, therefore I decided to attend this competition. I enjoy the time that I spent in the lab, it brought me great surprise and fun to me.
Hello，everybody .I am Huang yilin, and I go by Lynn.I am 16 years old and I am currently study at Beijing Foreign Language Study University International Course Center.I have diverse hobbies.For instance, reading , watching films ，make journals ,cooking and so on.I asm a big fan of delicious food.As a result, beside seek for yummy food, another thing that I like do is keeping fit,Like running or swimming .It’s the first time I take part in IGEM, although the subjects that I study in school has no connection with biology.I enjoy the fun that biology bring to me.Thanks  guys!
 
Hello, I’m Deng Rui, a 16-year-old student from BFSU-ICC. I am a very casual person, and I like biochemistry, I am mainly responsible for experiments and various things in the team, what I like most is to soak in the laboratory, and operate all kinds of facilities or culture bacteria. Also, I like to discuss our project with the team, and I'm glad to have such a group of partners. I hope I can strengthen all my skills by participating IGEM and progresses together with everybody!!!
Hello, I am Mark Shen, come from BFSU-ICC. I have always considered as a science student, which is also the reason why I dropped economics after one year of working, and chose to be study biology as a new subject. It seems that books and basketball will always follow me in school-a bottle of water as well, but the main thing I do back home is to focus on improving my knowledge of different aspects.  There are two reasons why I have become one part of our iGEM team: recommendation from my friends, and my preference to this project. I have then become a part of the Wiki team, which means I had to learn HTML5 and JavaScript. Even though it is a hard time, but I am still glad I got over through it.  PS：Little wish, I want to grown up to 185cm, and reduce my weight to 70kg. God bless me.
