PROTEIN EXPRESSION MEASUREMENTS
In order to show that our synthetic bacteria have a fully functional part that works, expression measurements were made. The construct was usually linked to superfold GFP. The fluorescent intensity can be measured in different ways and is directly related to the expression frequency of the construct (the more intense the signal the more expression you have). For most parts plate reader and microscopy experiments were done.
Plate Reading (Relative and Absolute Fluorescence)
A plate reader is able to take optical density (OD600nm) and fluorescent measurements over time. OD is a measure of bacterial growth over time and fluorescence a measure of protein expression over time.
