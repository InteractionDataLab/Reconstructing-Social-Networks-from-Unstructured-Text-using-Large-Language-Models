Teamwork
All members of our team participated studying the curriculum,reading previous project, and so on.
Browse the web
We often visit igem.org and parts.igem.org. we analyze the information of 2016team. From the analysis, we have known that iGEM competition is the best platform of communicating for the high school student.
Study curriculum
We studied chapter 1,2 and 3 of《An introduction to molecular Biology with Chinese Translation》We master the mechanism and regulation of transcription  in prokaryote
Learn about Classical experiment
we have explore some important experiments of the road of genetics.The progress increases our interest in biology and IGEM.
Study the software of snapgene.
Read the projects
We read some excellent previous project of iGEM.We do presentation, and then discuss these projects.
Brainstorm
Every one in our team come up with new idea for one project. These ideas include:
Medicine  for malarial artemisia
Medicine for heart disease
Detection of Sudan red
Medicine for depression
Degradation of plastic
Application of circadian promotion
Method of increasing memory
Detection of heavy metal in water
Everyone search the paper about his or her ideas.Preparing ppt for their projects.All members discuss together and determine the detection of heavy metal as our team’s project by voting the favorite project. We search the paper and informations about heavy metal. we found  that statue of liberty contain 80 tons of copper.We also learn about the increase of copper  consumption and mining. Therefore, we decide to improve the method of detection copper.
Plan for our project
Then, we visit parts.igem.org and search the profession paper for genes of copper detection. After that, we want to improve the method and design our project circuit.
Discuss the safety and application with professors and specialist
We gain advice from professors and specilist about our projects safety and significance and do the survey about copper
Attribution of our team’s members
All of us participates in doing experiment, editing wiki, collaboration, design logo and so on.However ,our team is divided into 3 groups.These are  experiment group, wiki group and human practice group.
Experiment group: Sally, Celina, Anita and Mark
Human practice: Tom,Tina
Wiki editing: Clarance, Lynn
 
Sally :1.Mail the informed consent form to iGEM HQ       2.Contracted with one of the BIT leader        3.Took parts in all of the project experiment and interlab experiment.       4.Wrote the method of experiment       5.Uploading the first vision of interlab wiki       6.Made presentation PPT       7.Took part in background writing       8.Made circuit diagram and part description for copper       9.As the leader of BFSUICC-China and had meeting with groupmate during self-study       10.Uploading the parts information       11.Manage data for factional test       12.Draw cartoon of our team
 
Celina: 1.took part in the experiment of our project      2.took picture and write method and note about the experiment      3.collating and keep data     4.participate the interlab experiment      5.made presentation PPT      6.write background and design      7.design the logo of the team      8.meet and communicate with our iGEM team
 
Anita :I'm Tingyue Li Anita. In the team, I mainly in charge of brainstorm, making ppt, and part of the edit of background. As well as the background and brainstorm, I also join most of the experiments with Sally and Celina. During the preparation later, I designed the team uniform.
 
Tom: I am mainly in charge of human practice with my classmate and team member Tina. She is my leader, and our job contact with other, and being a spy, because we went to the swimming pool got few samples for our lab. Also, we are responsible for presentation, such as the presentation between teams and teams, and we went to high school to the publicity the synthetic biology to students who interested in synthetic biology. That is a good chance for us to practice our speaking skill, and I’m very happy to participate in IGEM, hope sees you guys in Boston.
 
Tina: I was mainly responsible for human practice in the team, and my main job was to contact other teams and discuss our experimental plans and deficiencies. For example, in the initial stage of iGEM, we contacted students who had participated in iGEM before and asked them to tell us some experience and give us some valuable advice. This time, we learned a lot. At the same time, I and other students in charge of human practice will also go to other schools through WeChat or iGEM publicity. We went to a high school in Beijing to let students who were interested in synthetic biology know about iGEM. In this process, I think the biggest difficulty we encountered was how to contact other teams, how to adjust the time overlap between iGEM and learning. Through participating in this iGEM, I learned how to allocate my spare time, and I was very happy to meet many people with the same interests.
 
Clarance: I am mainly in charge of editing Wiki, which requires some basic knowledge about HTML5, that was what I had been told but the truth was far more “interesting” than that, I also need to acquire JavaScript. Well at first, I had lots of passion for learning how to create a website, but as I dug in, I became very desperate. I was far more completed than I thought. Therefore, I went out computer science teaches to ask for help. Because I don’t take computer science at school so my knowledge on either HTML5 or JavaScript were all from the internet which is not always correct and accurate. Our teacher, Mr Anton is a very patient man, he was very willing to teach me. Creating a good and nice website is a time consuming and a hard skill to learn. It is my first time ever to design a website so please, forgive me if there are many defects and mistake.
 
Lynn: 1.Taking note of team conference   2.Participated in experiments   3.Did the garph of parts circuit   4.Team Banner(haven't finished)   5.Wiki editing   6.Input whole arrangement into computer
