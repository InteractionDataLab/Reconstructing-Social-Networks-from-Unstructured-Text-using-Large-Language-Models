AGAROSE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS
Pouring a Standard 1% Agarose Gel:
1.Measure 1 g of agarose.
2.Mix agarose powder with 100 mL 1xTAE in a microwavable flask. See TAE Recipe.
3.Microwave for 1-3 min until the agarose is completely dissolved.
4.Let agarose solution cool down to about 50 °C (about when you can comfortably keep your hand on the flask), about 5 mins.
5.Pour the agarose into a gel tray with the well comb in place.
6.Place newly poured gel at 4 °C for 10-15 mins OR let sit at room temperature for 20-30 mins, until it has completely solidified.
Loading Samples and Running an Agarose Gel:
1.Add loading buffer to each of your DNA samples.
2.Once solidified, place the agarose gel into the gel box (electrophoresis unit).
3.Fill gel box with 1xTAE until the gel is covered.
4.Carefully load a molecular weight ladder into the first lane of the gel.
5.Carefully load your samples into the additional wells of the gel.
6.Run the gel at 80-150 V until the dye line is approximately 75-80% of the way down the gel. A typical run time is about 1-1.5 hours, depending on the gel concentration and voltage.
7.Turn OFF power, disconnect the electrodes from the power source, and then carefully remove the gel from the gel box.
8.Using any device that has UV light, visualize your DNA fragments. The fragments of DNA are usually referred to as ‘bands’ due to their appearance on the gel.
EXTRACTION THE DNA FRAGMENT FROM THE AGAROSE GEL
1.Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
2.Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg ~ 100 µl).
3.Incubate at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved).To help dissolve gel, mix by vortexing the tube every 2–3 min during the incubation.
4.After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose).
5.Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix.
6.Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube.
7.To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column, and centrifuge for 1 min.
8.Discard flow-through and place QIAquick column back in the same collection tube.
9.Recommended: Add 0.5ml of Buffer QG to QIAquick column and centrifuge for1min.
10.To wash, add 0.75 ml of Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min.
11.Discard the flow-through and centrifuge the QIAquick column for an additional 1min at 13,000 rpm.
12.Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
13.To elute DNA, add 50µl water (pH7.0–8.5) to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1min.  Alternatively, for increased DNA concentration, add 30µl elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min. After the addition of Buffer EB to the QIAquick membrane, increasing the incubation time to up to 4 min can increase the yield of purified DNA.
14.If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.
T4 LIGASE
1.Set up the following reaction in a microcentrifuge tube on ice.
2.Gently mix the reaction by pipetting up and down and microfuge briefly.
3.Incubate at 16°C overnight or room temperature for 10 minutes.
4.Heat inactivate at 65°C for 10 minutes.
5.Chill on ice and transform 1-5 μl of the reaction into 50 μl competent cells.
AGAROSE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS（checking）
we run the electrophoresis again to check the base pair is correct or not, thus we could know our ligation is successful or not.
