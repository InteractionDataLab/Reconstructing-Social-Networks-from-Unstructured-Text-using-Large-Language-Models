Biological Toolkit for copper detection
The world's production (supply) and consumption (demand) of copper have increased dramatically in the past 25 years. Massive mining and extensive using of copper results in serious contamination to environment, and then copper contamination threaten the balance of the whole ecosystem. We design a circuit that can better detect the amount of copper ions than before. We improve a previous Part by placing  self-cleaving RNA ribozyme RioJ between the promoter of CopA and RBS, and  replacing reporter of GFP by sf GFP. PcopA is regulated by Cue R protein. We design a new part that is made up of L-arabinose inducing pBAD, RBS and Cue R coding sequence. Furthermore we connect the improved part and the new part together, which is the circuit of our project. It is found that Cue R protein of different concentration affects the response of pCop A to Copper ions.
