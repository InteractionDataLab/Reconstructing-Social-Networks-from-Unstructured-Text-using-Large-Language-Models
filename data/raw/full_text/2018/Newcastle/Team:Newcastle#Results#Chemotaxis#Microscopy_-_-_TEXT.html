Principle
The need for microscopy work was highlighted after we were unable to determine the relative chemotactic response of our bacteria towards naringenin. The use of brightfield microscopy allowed us to make observations of if our bacteria was still motile and compare their morphology to that of the literature used in the community model. Microscopy enabled the development of the cell density:optical density index, this index was also utilised in the community model to adapt the growth curve data collected during bacterial characterisation in standard laboratory conditions.
Optical Density to Cell Density Index

Observing Bacterial Size
While producing the optical density:cell density index, it was also possible to use the haemocytometer to observe the phenotypic characteristics of our bacteria. This data would then be collated with the literature that was used to inform the Community Model about bacteria sizes. The use of microscopy also allowed us to assess the motility of our bacteria. By directly observing motility in liquid culture, the reasoning behind our results for quantitative capillary-based approach to characterising chemotaxis.
