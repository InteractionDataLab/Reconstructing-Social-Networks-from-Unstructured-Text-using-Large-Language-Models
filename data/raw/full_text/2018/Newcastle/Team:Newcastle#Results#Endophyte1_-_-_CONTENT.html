To ensure that we were working with a suitable organism, we needed to determine whether or not our selected organism, <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. strain CT 364, was able to colonise roots as both a wild type and a transformant. To do this it was necessary to develop root colonisation protocols, explore methods to detect the endophyte within plant roots and ensure the transformed endophyte is not detrimental to plant growth. </P></H1><H1 class="display">Inoculation and Re-isolation<P style="font-size:medium"> The first step was to see if <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. could be used to colonise the roots of <I>Arabidsopsis thaliana</I>. We looked into methods that involved root wounding, and the subsequent submergence of wounded roots into liquid endophyte cultures. However, engagement with GrowUp Urban Farms led us to consider alternative routes. This stakeholder engagement brought two issues to our attention: firstly, root wounding methods (as we initially intended) are not accessible to farmers and it was suggested that an alternative method of seed coating may be more appropriate. The second issue raised was that, from a commercial point of view, there is a concern that the genetically modified  <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp.  would be present in the leaves which may be harvested and eaten.</P><P style="font-size:medium"> To address these concerns the team ensured to investigate the presence of the <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. in both the root and stem / leaves. Furthermore, the team shifted from using a wounding inoculation method to a seed-coating method.</P><P style="font-size:medium"> The first set of results came from seed-coating experiments, where 96 <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I> seeds were surface sterilised and coated in a liquid culture of <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. wild type. Once germinated, 8 seedlings were selected and surface sterilised before being cut at the root and leaves for plating on typtone-soya agar (TSA) plates. Wild type <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. was re-isolated in pure culture from all of these samples and no <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. was re-isolated from a set of 8 control <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I> seedlings that had not been treated (Figure 1). These results showed that seed-coating was an appropriate inoculation method which makes our project more accessible for commercial use.</P><P style="font-size:small;text-align:center"> Figure 1. <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. on a TSA plate that has been re-isolated from <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I> seedlings which have been inoculated by the seed-coating method suggested by GrowUp Urban Farms (left), and a plate showing no <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. isolates amongst the wild endophytes (Right).</P></H1><H1 class="display">Visualising the wild type</H1></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row about-desc" data-aos="fade-up"><P style="font-size:medium">The team decided that the most valuable way to assess the endophytic relationship between <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. and its host plant was to use microscopy. The team sought expertise from Dr Vasilios Andriotis who advised bright field and fluorescence microscopy techniques.</P><P style="font-size:medium"> Using seedlings inoculated with wild type <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. as a positive control, initial microscopy used only water to mount the samples onto the microscope slide. This method was unsuitable for visualising bacteria in the root as bacteria were indistinguishable from the plant (Figure 8). Our <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. strain produces a fluorescent siderophore causing green fluorescence so we attempted to view the sample through a GFP filter, this was unsuccessful as the auto-fluorescence of plant tissue was too great to see the bacteria. To overcome this issue, 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) stain was used. DAPI is a highly-specific cell permeable fluorescent probe for double-stranded DNA (absorption 358 nm; emission 461 nm) – we used this to stain nucleic acids in the bacteria and visualise <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. in our samples. DAPI was added to distilled water at a concentration of 1 microlitre per millilitre DAPI, this was used to mount the sample and a DAPI filter was used to visualise the sample. Using a 100X immersion objective, bacteria were visible and this revealed a biofilm was present on the surface of the root (Figure 3), however, it was unclear if the bacteria were inside the root. To minimise the risk of non-specific root-microbe interactions, seedlings were washed at least three times in distilled water before imaging. Examination of the cleaned seedlings was challenged by the fact that root hair cells had wrapped around the main root during the washing process meaning that it was unclear if bacteria were inside the main root or merely on the surface.</P><P style="font-size:medium"> To overcome the issue of root hair cells wrapping, the team used 15 % glycerol in place of water for mounting samples. This was highly successful as the viscosity of the glycerol caused root hair cells to spread and revealed clear signs of colonisation. <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. was present in the intercellular spaces along both the root and hypocotyl. These bacteria were still motile and we could see them moving in real time.</P><P style="font-size:small;text-align:center">Figure 2. Bright field microscopy of a DAPI stained <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>. Wild type <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. is visible in the intercellular spaces.The seedling was imaged under bright field (BF) and under fluorescence (Fluoro) simultaneously, and photographed with a monochrome camera.

Fluorescence microscopy with a DAPI filter, <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. is visible on the surface of root hair cells.</P><P style="font-size:medium"> We were able to take images of the bright field microscopy with and without a DAPI filter (Figure 4 and 5 respectively) before merging the images to provide a clear visual representation of how the bacteria live within the plant (Figure 6).</P><P style="font-size:small;text-align:center">Figure 4.

Furthermore, a <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. transformant, transformed with a plasmid conferring gentamicin resistance, was also used to successfully colonise <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I> seedlings using the same method, with no negative impacts on seed germination or plant growth.</P><P style="font-size:medium">Microscopy analysis was used to successfully visualise both wild type and transformed <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. which had colonised <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I> seedling roots. We also observed that the bacterium colonises not only the root but also the hypocotyl and is able to form a biofilm on the root surface, another level to the plant-microbe association.</P><P style="font-size:medium">Finally, our germination assays demonstrated that the germination rate of <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I> seeds which had undergone a seed coating treatment with transformed <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. did not differ to the germination rate of seeds which had undergone a seed coating treatment with the wild type strain. This provides further evidence that the use of an engineered bacterial endophyte is suitable for use in our proposed system without negatively impacting plant growth.</P></H1></DIV></SECTION></DIV><SECTION id="references" class="s-services"><DIV class="row section-header has-bottom-sep" data-aos="fade-up"><DIV class="col-full"><H1 class="display-2">References &amp; Attributions</H1></DIV></DIV><BUTTON class="collapsible">Click for References &amp; Attributions</BUTTON><DIV class="content"><DIV class="row about-desc" data-aos="fade-up"><DIV class="col-full"><P class="about-para"><FONT size="3"><B>Attributions: Frank Eardley and Lewis Tomlinson</B></FONT></P><P class="about-para"><FONT size="3">References: Conte S, Stevenson D, Furner I, Lloyd A (2009) Multiple Antibiotic Resistance in Arabidopsis Is Conferred by Mutations in a Chloroplast-Localized Transport Protein.
