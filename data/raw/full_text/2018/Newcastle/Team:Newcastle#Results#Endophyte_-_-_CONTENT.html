This would indicate which selectable markers were suitable for use in transformation procedures. Five antibiotics were tested, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, gentamicin, carbenicillin and streptomycin. Kanamycin, gentamicin and streptomycin are all aminoglycosides with similar but independent modes of action interfering with protein synthesis via ribosomal binding. Chloramphenicol prevents protein chain elongation and carbenicillin interferes with cell wall synthesis. Many <I>Pseudomonas</I> species are known to be resistant to chloramphenicol but this antibiotic was tested to determine compatibility with pSB1C3 (1). Carbenicillin and the aminoglycosides have been identified as active against many <I>Pseudomonas</I> species (2 and 3). </FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">Antibiotic screening on tryptone soy agar (TSA) showed <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. to be resistant to chloramphenicol, kanamycin and carbenicillin.

This was done by carrying out minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) experiments where growth was tested against a range of antibiotic concentrations. To minimise variation between replicates MIC experiments were automated using an Opentrons OT-2 pipetting robot.</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">The results of MIC experiments showed a clear dose response between antibiotic concentration and growth of <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. for both streptomycin and gentamicin (Figures 7 and 8). Gentamicin was found to be the more effective antibiotic with a concentration of 1.5 µg/ml sufficient to prevent growth. A minimum concentration was clear for gentamicin with a significant drop in growth rate between concentrations of 1.0 µg/ml and 1.5 µg/ml. The minimum inhibitory concentration for streptomycin was less clear, with a small drop in growth rate for each increase in concentration. A working concentration of 6.0 µg/ml was determined for streptomycin. A slight increase in absorbance was observed in the positive control for both antibiotics. This is likely due to release of compounds by bacterial cells upon death.</FONT></P><P><FONT size="2"><CENTER>Figure 7. <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. strain CT 364 grown in tryptone soy broth containing gentamicin at varying concentrations.

Concentrations of 2.0 µg/ml, 4.0 µg/ml (Figure 9) and 6.0 µg/ml (Figure 10) were tested as the working concentration was expected to be slightly higher than the 1.5 µg/ml MIC in liquid culture due to lower availability of antibiotic in agar. It was necessary to establish a working concentration in agar as cells would be plated onto agar following transformation. Gentamicin was selected as the working antibiotic as it is known to stunt Arabidopsis growth (4). Treatment of Arabidopsis with a gentamicin resistant transformant could prevent stunting of growth by breaking down gentamicin in the rhizosphere (5). Demonstrating that a plant colonising microbe can be used to change the physiology of the plant. </FONT></P><P><FONT size="2"><CENTER>Figure 9. <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. strain CT 364 plated on tryptone soy agar containing gentamicin (4 µg/ml).</CENTER></FONT></P><P><FONT size="2"><CENTER>Figure 10. <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. strain CT 364 plated on tryptone soy agar containing gentamicin (6 µg/ml).</CENTER></FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">Agar assays showed that concentrations of 2.0 µg/ml and 4.0 µg/ml of antibiotic were insufficient to prevent growth of <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. on agar.

The function of this plasmid was as a helper plasmid for conjugation. This plasmid could therefore also be used to optimise conjugation protocols for <I>Pseudomonas</I> sp. if transformation of larger plasmids is required.

A 10 times concentration of 50 µg/ml was also tested to determine if there was an upper limit to resistance.
