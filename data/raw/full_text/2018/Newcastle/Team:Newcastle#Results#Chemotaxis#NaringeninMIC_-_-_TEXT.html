Influence of Naringenin on Growth Rate of Bacteria in Liquid Media

Principle
In addition to being a chemoattractant, naringenin possess antimicrobial properties against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [1]. We therefore characterised the effect that increasing concentrations of naringenin had on the growth rate of Azospirillum brasilense, Azorhizobium caulinodans, Herbaspirillum seropedicae, and E. coli. This information was essential in guiding our chemotaxis assays.

Results
All species successfully grew in the presence of 0-150μM naringenin (Figure 1). However, it was noted that E. coli showed reduced growth rate even at lower concentration of naringenin. When concentration of naringenin exceeded 100μM, there exists greater flux in all species suggesting that naringenin begins to have a greater impact on some, but not all, bacteria. As such, naringenin concentrations of <100μM were used as part of subsequent chemotaxis assays as to not negatively impact bacterial growth.
