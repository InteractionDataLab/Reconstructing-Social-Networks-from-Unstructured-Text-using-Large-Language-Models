Overview
New Interlab Parts Collection
We developed a collection of parts that enable an alternative measurement approach to both the InterLab study and assessing promoter ‘strength’ for other projects. Our parts collection includes an RFP device inserted into the pSB1C3 backbone that acts as an internal standard (IS) for the device being assessed. Four of the Interlab test devices have been returned with this modification. Second, we designed and deposited a new mNeonGreen fluorescent reporter part ( BBa_K2797003 ) into the registry. This part demonstrated an improvement in the reproducibility over the existing GFPmut3b reporter currently in use in each test device. Five of the Interlab devices were returned with this modification.
