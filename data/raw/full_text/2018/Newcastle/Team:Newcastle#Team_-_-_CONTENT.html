</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-block service-item" data-aos="fade-up"><DIV class="service-text"><H3 class="white_h3">Josh Isaac</H3><P>During my third year of Pharmacy, I came across synthetic biology through its diagnostic potential in the Rapid, Low-Cost Detection of Zika Virus Using Programmable Biomolecular Components. After more reading I left Pharmacy with a BSc in Pharmaceutical Sciences and pursue a masters in Synthetic Biology, which I completed end of August 2018. 

Throughout my masters it became apparent to me that Synthetic biology is moving towards a systems era and whilst module complexity and capability has advanced rapidly, integrating techniques have not. My research looks to overcome this bottleneck through dsRNA strand displacement cascades - by stacking these cascades you can emulate the same gated logic used in electrical engineering. Specifically I aimed to provide a proof of concept and build a model to study how changing sequence energetics affects the behaviour of individual and stacked displacement motifs in response to an RNA input. These transcription based tools could enable algorithms and SCADA systems to be encoded into plasmids whereby the result is reported via Toehold Riboswitch.

I’m currently pursuing PhD opportunities that will allow me to move past modelling and into synthesis, assembly, and implementation, to introduce to Synthetic Biology what the 7400 integrated circuits brought to electrical engineering.

My fascination with plant biology started when I was an undergraduate student and my research supervisor, Prof. Vladimir Pyankov, invited me into work with Prof. Gerald Edwards. After my PhD on plant genetics, I was fortunate to work with Gerry again at Washington State University revisiting evolution of C4 photosynthesis in the succulent clade of chenopods. This work was very formative and enforced my enthusiasm for plant science and photosynthesis research. My PhD led to a period of postdoctoral research on plant molecular evolution in Prof. Dmitry Filatov’s lab (Oxford) where I began developing my independent research vision to combine evolutionary analysis with my background in photosynthesis and apply this to the evolution of the major CO2 fixing enzyme, Rubisco. In 2013, I was invited by Prof. Spencer Whitney to work in his lab at Australian National University within the Gates funded project 'RIPE: Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency for sustainable increases in crop yield'. Using chloroplast transformation in plants I showed current limitations of interspecies Rubisco translocation and how they could be overcome by co-expressing cognate Rubisco chaperones. Working with RIPE made me aware of global challenges in food security. In September 2017 I started as a Senior Lecturer at Newcastle University.
