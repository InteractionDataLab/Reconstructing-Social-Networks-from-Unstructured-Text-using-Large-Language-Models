To secure higher productivity, the sector relies upon synthetic fertilisers derived from energy intensive manufacturing methods; the run-off from these fertilisers coupled with the food mileage required for crops to reach our cities is having a devastating environmental impact. In addition, for every 1 °C increase in atmospheric temperature, 10 % of farmland used for crop production will be lost [1]. This destructive cycle impacts consumers, farmers, and the environment.</P><P class="about-para">In the coming decades, urbanisation is expected to increase considerably. Today, 54 % of the world population lives in urban areas. By 2050, this share is forecast to increase to 66 %. That equates to an additional 2.4 billion people living in urban centres [2]. </P><P><CENTER>[3]</CENTER></P><P class="about-para">One way of protecting our crops and the land we use for agriculture is by growing within controlled, contained environments.

Newcastle’s Victoria Tunnel; a disused tunnel that was once used to transport coal from the mines down to the river for shipment - as well as serving as a bunker during WWII.

GrowUp used to use Aquaponics, a method of growing that uses fish and their waste to provide nutrients in a conventional hydroponic system. We asked him about how consumers respond to this method of growing.

Talks with Tom Webster (CTO at GrowUp Urban Farms) highlighted concerns about the localisation of the endophyte within the plant. We had not considered the issues with the GMO being present in the leaves/fruit of the plant.</P><P class="about-para">This impacted our wetware in that we no longer attempted to re-isolate endophytes from just the roots, from this point we cut roots and leaves separately to re-isolate endophytes. In the event of the endophyte being present in the fruit it is possible for future work to engineer the bacterium to remain localised in the root.</P><H3>Safety Considerations</H3><P class="about-para">We had a Skype meeting with Chris Tapsall, Research Director at <A href="https://www.kws-uk.com/"><FONT color="green">KWS Seeds</FONT></A>. <A href="https://www.kws-uk.com/"><FONT color="green">KWS</FONT></A> are one of the top 5 biggest seed producers in the world. The meeting was eye-opening, we discussed consumers views towards the use of GMOs in crop production and how some markets may be more accepting of our product than others. We also talked about the importance of transparency when it comes to marketing a product in relation to the use of genetically modified material.</P><P class="about-para">We learnt about certain EU regulations and alternative applications for our bacteria (i.e. methods in which a manufacturer could apply our bacteria to a seed). Chris was passionate about our project and forwarded our information to other researchers in KWS.</P><P class="about-para">Please see our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Newcastle/Safety"><FONT color="green">Safety Page</FONT></A> for more information on how we designed our urban farm to comply with safety standards. </P><H3>Consumer Views</H3><P class="about-para">When eating at a local restaurant, one of our team members noticed the small print at the bottom of the menu (see below). The small print assures customers that none of their food products contain ‘genetically modified materials.’ This made us question whether consumers would want to eat food grown with our bacteria.</P><P class="about-para">Products grown within our proposed urban farm would be different to the traditional genetically modified crops in the sense that our crops wouldn’t be genetically modified at all – but the bacteria that colonise the roots would be. As a result, we think that this would make consumers more comfortable about eating products grown in this way.</P><P class="about-para">To further our understanding about consumer views and how best to market our product we invited <A href="http://www.foodnewcastle.org/"><FONT color="green">Food Nation</FONT></A> to visit us at the University. <A href="http://www.foodnewcastle.org/"><FONT color="green">Food Nation</FONT></A> is a social enterprise based in Newcastle with a vision to inspire people about good food, they have extensive knowledge about consumers views on food products.</P><P class="about-para">Listening to Food Nations story and learning about the good food initiatives they’re involved with led us to re-evaluate the values of our own project. The food companies we visited prior to <A href="http://www.foodnewcastle.org/"><FONT color="green">Food Nation</FONT></A> (<A href="http://www.growmodule365.co.uk/"><FONT color="green">GrowModule365</FONT></A>, <A href="http://growing-underground.com/"><FONT color="green">Growing Underground</FONT></A>, <A href="https://www.growup.org.uk/"><FONT color="green">GrowUp Urban Farms</FONT></A>) were all commercial enterprises – but we loved <A href="http://www.foodnewcastle.org/"><FONT color="green">Food Nation's</FONT></A> approach to social enterprise, promoting initiatives owned by local communities and businesses, any profits of which go back into the community. Prior to this, our proposed economic model for the tunnel would have looked something similar to that of the commercial enterprises; however, we began to see the potential of the Victoria Tunnel Urban Farm as a resource that could be owned and maintained by the communities that use it: an educational tool, an accessible source of fresh produce, or perhaps even a food bank.</P><P class="about-para">If we take this project further after the Giant Jamboree, <A href="http://www.foodnewcastle.org/"><FONT color="green">Food Nation</FONT></A> have the contacts to enable us to conduct thorough public consultations as well as the relevant contacts within the local council who could potentially make a concept like the Victoria Tunnel Urban Farm possible. By engaging with <A href="http://www.foodnewcastle.org/"><FONT color="green">Food Nation</FONT></A> we have started a conversation locally about the adaptive re-use of the Victoria Tunnel as an urban farm. </P><H3>Conclusion</H3><P class="about-para">Our thorough approach to stakeholder engagement has had a huge impact on the outcome of our project. The Victoria Tunnel Urban Farm concept was our way of bringing it all together: stakeholder engagement, safety, hardware, and wetware. Moreover, it gave us the opportunity to demonstrate our vision of what a sustainable urban future may look like for Newcastle – a future that uses land efficiently, a future that reduces the pressure on the agriculture industry to use synthetic fertilisers... a future for sustainable agriculture.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="urbanFarmPlan" class="s-services"><DIV class="row section-header has-bottom-sep" data-aos="fade-up"><DIV class="col-full"><H3 class="subhead">Human Practices</H3><H1 class="display-2">Step 4:  Victoria Tunnel Urban Farm</H1></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row services-list block-1-2 block-tab-full"><DIV class="row about-desc" data-aos="fade-up"><DIV class="col-full"><P class="about-para">A trip to the tunnels demonstrated their size and potential as a growing environment and we began to consider the possibility of our design becoming realised.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="map" class="s-services"><DIV class="" data-aos="fade-up"><DIV class="col-full"><P class="about-para">The Victoria Tunnel is 3.9 kilometres in length and runs under many urban 'hubs’ that could utilise an urban farm (For example: Newcastle and Northumbria University campuses &amp; The Royal Victoria Infirmary).
