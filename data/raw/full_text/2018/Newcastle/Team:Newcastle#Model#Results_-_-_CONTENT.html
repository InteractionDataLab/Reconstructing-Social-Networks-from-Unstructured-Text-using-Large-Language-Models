By manipulating the regulatory structure of the pathway through the design of our model, bottlenecks and stoichiometric imbalances could be investigated. Figure 1A shows that the model meets the most basic requirement in converting L-tyrosine to naringenin. </FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">The extent of active site saturation for each of the four enzymes is displayed in Figure 1A. Both CHI and 4CL remain unsaturated throughout the run time suggesting that these two reactions in the pathway are not rate limiting. TAL is initially highly saturated when L-tyrosine is in greatest excess but as the system reaches a steady state TAL concentration has a less significant effect on the flux of the pathway. As the system moves towards a steady state CHS becomes the most rate limiting enzyme. P-coumaroyl CoA produced by 4CL starts to build up and binds to the active site of CHS. Insufficient malonyl CoA in the system means that naringenin chalcone cannot be produced quickly enough and CHS becomes increasingly saturated with P-coumaroyl CoA.</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">Figure 1A. Change in relative number of free enzymes for each of the four enzymes in the system over a time period of 50 seconds.</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">Figure 1B shows how the three intermediate resources in the pathway change over time in comparison to naringenin production. Malonyl CoA is utilised more rapidly than ATP in the system as three molecules of malonyl CoA and only one ATP are required for each molecule of naringenin. In the pathway, one free CoA is utilised to produce P-coumaroyl CoA and four CoAâ€™s are produced as a by-product in naringenin chalcone production. Due to higher flux through the pathway up until P-coumaroyl CoA, after initial fluctuation CoA concentration remains steady. </FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">Figure 1B. Consumption of input resources by the system over a time period of 50 seconds.</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">The rate of accumulation of each waste product from the pathway is shown in Figure 1C. As CoA is both a substrate and waste product it is included in both Figure 1B and 1C. One molecule of ammonia and a proton as well as AMP and PPi are produced by TAL and 4CL respectively. Production of these pairs are therefore equal, and each pair are represented by one line in Figure 1C. With the exception of CoA, CO<SUB>2</SUB> is the only by-product produced after P-coumaroyl CoA. Three waste molecules of CO<SUB>2</SUB> are produced for every Ammonia, H<SUP>+</SUP>, AMP and PPi. Despite the similar amount of each waste product are produced. This again suggests an imbalance of flux in the pathway.</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">Figure 1C. Accumulation of waste resources in the system over a time period of 50 seconds.</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">In Figure 2A, 2B and 2C the bottleneck is removed by increasing the input amount of malonyl CoA by 3-fold compared to the other required resources. Figure 2B shows that the change has removed the bottleneck as CHS no longer becomes saturated. P-coumaroyl CoA no longer remains bound to CHS as sufficient malonyl CoA is available for production of naringenin chalcone.</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">Figure 2A. Change in relative number of free enzymes for each of the four enzymes in the system over a time period of 50 seconds when input of Malonyl CoA is 3x other resources.</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">Figures 2C and 2D show that after an initial decrease CoA increases over time. This is evidence that flux through the system is more balanced as more CoA is produced than utilised by the system so this would be expected to increase over time.

Accumulation of waste resources in the system over a time period of 50 seconds when input of Malonyl CoA is 3x other resources</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">The results of the initial characterisation of the system show that CHS has the greatest control of flux through the pathway due to the high demand on malonyl CoA which is a limiting resource. This bottleneck could be removed by two approaches. Additional parts could be added to the operon to up regulate malonyl CoA production. This would increase the metabolic load and resource drain on the chassis organism potentially impacting on its ability to colonise the plant. Another approach would be to downregulate p-coumaroyl CoA production by altering expression of 4CL and TAL. Only trace amounts of naringenin are required for chemotaxis this option is more suitable for our system.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="SensitivityScans" class="s-services"><DIV class="row section-header has-bottom-sep" data-aos="fade-up"><DIV class="col-full"><H1 class="display-2">Sensitivity Scans</H1></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row about-desc" data-aos="fade-up"><DIV class="col-full"><P><FONT size="3">To characterise performance and identify regulatory elements within the design, scans of the model were performed where 100 simulations were run for each species; each time increasing an individual species count by 5 molecules from 0 to 500. Other species amounts were kept at a constant of 100 molecules. The effect of varying each species on conversion of naringenin to L-tyrosine (d[Naringenin] / d[L-tyrosine]) was plotted to outline performance sensitivity for each species on overall output. Through these scans parts of the system most likely to cause stability issues in a dynamic environment can be identified. Further evidence of bottlenecks within the system is also provided. With this information conclusions can be drawn on how the design may be improved by changing parts.</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">TAL, CHS and 4CL do not affect d[Naringenin] / d[L-tyrosine] in a linear manner at low concentrations, behaviour may therefore not be consistent and predictable in the dynamic environment for which this system is being built (Figures 3A, 3B and 3C).  TALs sensitivity fluctuates as its amount increases from 0 to 40. Similar behaviour is seen when molecule counts are greater than 10 for 4CL. Production plateaued at around 50 molecules for 4CL and CHI and at 150 molecules for TAL and CHS. TAL and CHS therefore have a greater regulatory effect on naringenin production.</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">Figure 3A.

CoA is only rate limiting up to about 45 molecules whereas ATP and malonyl CoA are limiting up to 100 and 375 respectively (Figure 3E). This is because the metabolite produced using CoA produces three CoAs as waste upon catalysis with CHS. The net change is therefore +2 so as long as there is sufficient CoA to begin with, the systems waste will satisfy its demand. ATPs sensitivity fluctuates till its plateau at approximately 100 molecules (Figure 3F). The fluctuations may be the result of ATP increasing the rate of conversion of p-coumaric acid to p-coumaroyl CoA such that CoA is used quicker than initially produced so waste does not satisfy demand. Malonyl CoA is the most rate limiting resource as the demand per unit time is three times than any other resources (Figure 3G). This can be seen with its plateau being approximately three times that of ATP. Malonyl CoA also has by far the greatest effect on production, suggesting it is the most rate limiting resource.</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">Figure 3E.

It was hoped that this would stabilize phase transient fluctuations to make the system more predictable and robust at low molecular counts seeing as our system requirements are to have a steady and continuous output of Naringenin, potentially at low concentrations.</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">Increasing malonyl CoA relative to the enzymes meant that transient phase fluctuations for the enzymes were no longer present (Figures 2.B). Moreover, TAL becomes the most rate limiting enzyme under these conditions and could be adjusted to alter naringenin output without comprising stability. This could be done by adjusting regulatory parts preceding the TAL coding sequence. Removing the malonyl CoA bottle neck changed the range of effect on d[Naringenin] / d[L-tyrosine] such that minimal and maximal sensitivity values were 0 to 20-24 for all instead of 0 to 1-2.5 (Figures 3 and 4).</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">Figure 4A.

Alterations in should affect d[Naringenin] / d[L-tyrosine] in a more linear fashion making the behavior of the system more predictable and robust.</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">Figure 4E.

Increasing the supply of malonyl CoA to three times that of other species removed transient phase perturbations on d[Naringenin] / d[L-tyrosine] making system behavior more robust and predictable. Removing the malonyl CoA bottle neck increased the range of effect of individual enzyme expression on d[Naringenin] / d[L-tyrosine] allowing more intricate tuning with respect to making the system stable or broadening its range of function. To implement this, we plan to under-express TAL and 4CL in turn removing malonyl CoA limitations.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="RegulatoryChanges" class="s-services"><DIV class="row section-header has-bottom-sep" data-aos="fade-up"><DIV class="col-full"><H1 class="display-2">Regulatory Changes</H1></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row about-desc" data-aos="fade-up"><DIV class="col-full"><P><FONT size="3">To model the effects of changing device design (i.e. promotor and RBS components), a transcription and translation system was built.
