NH-1

Software Guide
Adaptability was a major issue with the existing plant growth infrastructure within the University and, in fact, with many traditional growth facilities. We designed the NH-1 to combat this. The NH-1 is controlled entirely by an Arduino micro-controller. The Arduino offers a low-cost, easy-to-use solution to control and adapt the function of the LEDs. The Arduino also offers an open-source electronic prototyping platform and offers plenty of opportunities for further development of the NH-1, in terms of user interface and interaction. All the code and the IDE are freely available online and the UNO board can be purchased online from Arduino for less than Â£20. The Arduino language is based on C/C++ so it is incredibly easy to become familiar with, especially if you already have experience with C/C++ but if not there is a wealth of resources online that can help with this. We have designed a guide to using the IDE and included some examples of the capabilities of the NH-1. Some of the features that you can incorporate include:
Solid colours across the system
Cyclically varying colours (rainbow) in the system
Linear gradients of colours across the system
Colours can be defined by RGB, HSV values or HTML standard
Brightness can be varied, for example to simulate a day/night cycle or a gradual sunrise/sunset
The list goes on as the possibilities with the NH-1 are incredibly varied. This makes it the ideal system for plant-based experimentation, with the added bonus that the system is completely contained and portable. The end result is a highly adaptable, semi-autonomous system that is simple to code and even easier to run.
