September 20, 2018
BINDING
Separate gel ran for the digest CBP PCR. Gel purification was performed on all of the digested DNA portions.
SENSING
PCR primers designed to amplify the sensing part. Another gel electrophoresis was performed on the sensing ligation, pMAL digest, Sensing Digest, and iGEM digest. The amount of DNA used in this gel was higher. See Figure 14.
September 21, 2018
SENSING
iGem PCR and sensing PCR primers ordered. A ligation was attempted using the digested PCR and digested pMAL.
A gel of the ligation, pMAL digest, pMAL, and Sensing Digest was run. Gelled binding PCR digest. Gel fragments collected. This gel used higher amounts of dna by adding a greater amount of DNA. See Figures 15 and 16.

Filtered LB medium was prepared and used to grow up the sensing colonies for the test. A gel was run for the 2 PCRs. See Figure 19.
October 4, 2018
SENSING
None of the sensing colonies grew. No OD600 was done due to lack of cuvettes. The positive and negative control did grow. A PCR was set up to attempt the sensing PCR again, the PCR was then gelled. The successful iGem PCR from 10/3 and the PCR from sensing 8/4 were digested with the respective enzymes and left overnight. See Figure 20.
October 5, 2018
SENSING
A PCR was run to get more sensing and iGem DNA. The PCR product was run in a gel. The products where amplification was seen were then cut with EcoRI, PstI, and DpnI (for the iGem PCRs only). See Figure 21.
October 6, 2018
SENSING
We ran a gel and gel purified the overnight digestion of the iGEM and sensing PCRs from 10/5. Then ligated the cut PCR products from 10/3. Then, the ligation product was transformed. At the same time as the transformation, the ligation product was run in a gel. See Figure 22.
