FRET Ratio Model
Background
This model aims to find out how much FRET protein should be added into our screening system.
Methods
Chemical equilibrium is used to determine the concentration of each protein, the fluorescence level, and the minimal FRET protein activity required to produce the fluorescence that can be detected. This model assumes the portion of active protein in all proteins is constant. The equilibrium constants are from Victoria E. Ahn's study [1] and Zhihong Cheng's study [2]. The limited experiment budget for making FRET proteins is considered in this model.
Results

FRET Efficiency Model
Background
The efficiency of FRET is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance between donor and acceptor, making FRET extremely sensitive to small changes in distance. Therefore, simulating structure of protein-protein interactions is important. This model aims to predict the FRET efficiency in order to determine which molecules and which termini should be used.
Methods
pyDockWEB [3] is used for structural prediction of protein-protein interactions and the prediction of distances between donor and acceptor. Förster theory is used to determine the FRET efficiency. YPet and CyPet are added to either N-terminus or C-terminus of each of the 2 FRET proteins.
Results
The protein-protein interactions structural predictions are as follows:
Cyan: LRP6-BP1BP2      Green: LRP6-BP3BP4      Purple: DKK1
Cyan: LRP6-BP3BP4      Green: VHH G5      Purple: DKK1
Cyan: VHH H7      Green: VHH G5      Purple: DKK1
The predicted distances are
YPet and CyPet are added to the N-terminus or the C-terminus.
Conclusion
The FRET efficiency is given by the following table.
YPet and CyPet are added to the N-terminus or the C-terminus.

mCherry Expression Model
Background
This project constructs a plasmid that connects DKK1 promoter to mCherry. The gene expression rate of DKK1 promoter is affected by testosterone activity and affects the expression level of mCherry. The expression level of mCherry should be greater than a threshold so that its fluorescence can be detected by devices. In order to achieve this threshold, sufficient amount of testosterone should be added into our screening system; this is the sensitivity of our screening system. This model aims to find out the sensitivity of our screening system.
Methods
This model simulates the kinetics of transcription signal the expression of DKK1 promoter. The process of protein synthesis is simulated with differential equations, assuming the synthesis of mCherry follows the central dogma of molecular biology. Signaling pathways of the androgen receptor is modeled based on chemical equilibrium of each transcription factor and intermediate.
Results
The increment of DKK1 gene expression rate caused by effective DHT activity
Expected DKK1 protein expression level: [DKK1] = 5 + 0.006 [DHT]2
where [DKK1] indicates DKK1 activity in ng/ml and [DHT] indicates DHT activity in nM.
Note: This is accurate only when [DHT] is less than 50 nM. [5]
Conclusion
[mCherry] = c1 + c2 [Testosterone]2
where square brackets indicate activity in M, and c1 and c2 are constants to be determined.
Note: This model is accurate only when [DHT] is less than 50 nM. [5]
