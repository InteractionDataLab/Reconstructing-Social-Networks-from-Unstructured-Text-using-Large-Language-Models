Safety
OVERVIEW
This year, we propose a quick and easy platform to determine the effectiveness of hair loss treatments, without animal or human testing, by evaluating a critical protein of the hair regeneration pathway, DKK-1. We are aware of the fact that all biological experiments could pose risks to the environment and experimenters and, therefore, should only be conducted under strict regulations. For our project, we seek to achieve this high standard of biosafety by responsibly following the biosafety guidelines provided by the iGEM Headquarters.
BIOSAFETY
The chassis we used in the project include Escherichia coli (E. coli), human cell line HEK-293, and dermal papilla.
Escherichia coli
We used the DH5 alpha strain and BL21 strain of E. coli for our project, which are both BSL-1 organisms. Although the E. coli strains we used pose little to no risk of pathogen transmission, there is still a risk of causing skin, eye, and respiratory tract irritation. To prevent irritations, everyone in the wet-lab was required to wear full, proper protection gear when manipulating E. coli competent cells and cultures. All materials that came in contact with bacterial cultures or competent cells were autoclaved and disposed properly.
Human cell line
The HEK293 cell line is a BSL-1 organism and the human dermal papilla cell line is a BSL-2 organism. All experiments with the human cell line were conducted in a separate BSL-2 cell culture room under the supervision of our instructor. All materials that came in contact with the human cell lines were autoclaved and disposed properly.
LAB SAFETY
Training
To conduct experiments properly and safely, all of the team members were given lab training and lab safety lessons directed by our instructors and members from the 2017 NYMU-Taipei iGEM team.
Safe Lab Work
All experiments were done in proper conditions considering their Biosafety Level, and we strictly followed the Laboratory Safe Hygiene Precautions of our school. All team members who participated in lab work wore personal protection equipment, such as but not limited to lab coats, rubber gloves, long pants, and closed-toe shoes. All experimental procedures were first checked and approved by our instructor before conducting experiments, and the lab notes were recorded immediately after the experiments.
Waste Treatment
the Biological waste treatment process of Center of Environmental Protection and Safety and Health in our school.
We ensured the strict implementation of all of these methods to prevent accidents, contamination, and the potential spread of pathogens.
