iGEM Team of
CCU_Taiwan
We have had a meaningful collaboration with CCU_Taiwan iGEM team in interlab study. When CCU_Taiwan worked on interlab, they were not able to transform the plasmids for Interlab from iGEM kits into thier competent cells E. coli DH5α. This caused their interlab study to be stuck right at the beginning. (For more detail about the problem CCU_Taiwan iGEM faced, click here .)
They started to ask for help from other iGEM teams and we decided to give them a hand. We had several online meetings to help them troubleshoot their interlab study. We even read their labnotes and discussed together. However, due to the proximity of the deadline for interlab data submission, we think that it would be a good idea to make a backup plan for them. Therefore, we gave them E. coli into which we had successfully transformed with plasmids for interlab. We have also gotten  through our interlab study in advance to make sure that we have the right concepts and methods to help them out.
With our help and with their perseverance, CCU_Taiwan eventually finished their interlab study and their result was accepted by the iGEM Headquarters on August 24.
iGEM Team of
TAS Taipei
As we have always done, NYMU iGEM cooperated with TAS iGEM team in various aspects this year. We have closely cooperated in conducting interlab study. Some TAS members attended our weekly meetings, joined our discussion on our projects, gave advice on our deliverables, and troubleshoot our experiment failures. On the approach of DNA submission deadline, they also help us by simultaneously cloning and checking our mEGFP (BBa_K2751011) and ALB-mCherry (BBa_K2751012) into a pSB1C3 backbone. (For more details please look into their collaboration page .)
We returned their favor by supplying them with chemicals, reagents such as PEG8000 and MR17 broth. We also lend them electroporation machine and provided protocols for electroporation of Lactobacillus. Access and instructions for plate reader were given by us as well.
We are thankful for the help from TAS and hope to keep on collaborating with them afterwards.
iGEM Team of
Tokyo Tech
While working on our screening model, we found out that Tokyo tech is using similar techniques. Their topic this year is to develop an affordable kit to detect Dengue virus and predict its serotype. Although we have very different goals, both of our teams have faced the same problem of ELISA being too expensive to put into practice. In our online meeting, we conversed about the pros and cons of different modeling techniques and the issues that come up when we do not use ELISA. The discussion with them inspired us in improving our project, and we have maintained contact with them ever since. We hope that the meeting was just as useful for them and wish the best of luck for their project.
