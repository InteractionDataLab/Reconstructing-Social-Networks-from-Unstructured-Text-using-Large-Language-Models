Parts Overview
Parts
Our part collection includes TonB-dependent receptor DNA sequence, 2-haloacid dehalogenase DNA sequence, Laccase           DNA sequence, and also the intermediate part of 2-haloacid dehalogenase + Laccase and the final combination part           of three genes. In order to let the gene can be expressed in endophyte, we bought a shuttle vector from addgene           and replace the ori and also the resistance gene, which can also be seen in the basic part.
Basic Parts
BBa_K2546001: This part is coding for 2-haloacid dehalogenase, which can cleavage carbon-halogen bonds of             halogenated compounds
BBa_K2546004: This part is a shuttle vector with red fluorescence protein (RFP). It is composed by the Ori             of pMP4657 and BBa_J364007 in pSB1C3.
BBa_K2546007: This part is a shuttle vector with red fluorescence protein (RFP). It is composed by the Ori             of pMP4657 and BBa_J364007 in pSB1C3.
BBa_K2546008: This part is a shuttle vector with green fluorescence protein (GFP). It is composed by the             Ori of pBBR1 and BBa_J364007 in pSB1C3.
BBa_K2546010: This part is coding for TonB-dependent receptor, which can actively transport the ferric ion             carrier, siderophore, which is similar in structure with dioxin.
BBa_K2546011: This part is coding for Laccase, which is related to lignin degradation.
Intermediate Parts
BBa_K2546002: This part is the combination of BBa_K2546001 and BBa_K2546011 which contain ribosome binding             site.
Composite Parts
BBa_K2546005: This part is the promoter circuit of BBa_K2546002.
BBa_K2546006: This part is the combination of BBa_K2546012 and BBa_K2546002 ,which is our ultimate goal to             let three gene be expressed in one circuit.
BBa_K2546012: This part is the promoter circuit of BBa_K2546010.
