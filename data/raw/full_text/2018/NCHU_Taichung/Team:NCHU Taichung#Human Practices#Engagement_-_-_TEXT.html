Education & Public Engagement
Education and public engagement are where we can bring knowledge of synthetic biology and iGEM to the society.
Youth Education
We went to an elementary school in remote area to teach children about how genetics biology can be found                     on both animals and plant. We created a nucleotide game for them to better understand the very tiny                   thing, DNA, which appears to have a significant effect on living things. In addition, we prepared a simple                   experiment for them to extract the DNA of kiwifruit. They all found it amazing and interesting.
Genetics of our body
Why are we different in appearance? You have big eyes but I don’t. She has widow’s peak while he doesn’t.                   What bring about this? We started the class with the activity, having children compare the differences                   between each other. This is the most direct way for them to find out how gene plays an important role in                   our bodies.
Genetics of plant
After the warm up of comparing oneself with others, we taught them genetics can also be found in                   plant. By showing them same kind of flowers with different color and other features, we taught them that                   gene not only makes us unique but also gives rise to the difference between plants.
Nucleotide-matching Game
In this part, we prepared a DNA-matching card game for them to understand how ATCGs work and bind to one                   another by either double or triple hydrogen bonds. To our surprise, they found it interesting and actually                   easy-understanding. We had a short video as followed.

DNA-extracting Experiment
At the end of the class, we played a short video of DNA extraction and had them do the experiment personally.                   Just a simple and short experiment for them to “see” the DNA of kiwifruit in spiral. The following video                   was Q&A time after the DNA extraction video.

School Club Fair
The school club fair was held at the very beginning of the first semester. We got a booth to promote this                   worldwide competition, iGEM, and tell people about synthetic biology. Since this is the first year for                   NCHU to attend iGEM, all the people who came to the booth found interesting about this event. It was really                   a great chance getting more people to know about how synthetic biology can be found in our daily lives.
Food Evolution Forum
This forum discussed about facts of genetically modified food on two very opposite perspectives. The forum                 had invited a former chairman U.S. Soybean Export Council and a famous researcher of molecular biology in                 Taiwan to reveal some myths and rumors about GMO. Attendees are allowed to ask questions and get further                 information about the facts of GMO. Since iGEM has a lot to do with genetic modified organism, we attended                 this event and got to know that
“GMO is something not good” should still be under investigation due to the defects in previous research.
Genetic-modified-microorganism on Board
Genetic modified food is widely known by the public, but how about genetic modified microorganism? According                 to our project, we wanted to know how does the public think of genetic modified microorganism. The interview                 was named “Genetic-modified-microorganism on Board”, by interviewing people at random, we got perspectives                 from up to thirty people. Most of them stood on the positive side while a few people still have concern about                 the safety of genetic modified microorganism. This gave us a feedback that if our product is to be applied in the future, careful experiments should be done to ensure the safety of                   it.
