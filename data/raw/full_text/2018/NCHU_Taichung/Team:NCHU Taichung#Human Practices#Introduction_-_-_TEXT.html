Introduction
During Vietnam War, herbicide, agent orange, which contains dioxin, was spread over in Vietnam for American army           to have a clear sight about all the Vietnamese hiding in the forest. However, the residual dioxin caused severe           gene mutations on the progeny of victims that survived after the war.
In order to know the adverse effect of dioxin on the victims, we went to Vietnam in person. This is how we           get the idea of our project, using microorganism and further applied by technique of phytoremediation to break           down dioxin in large dioxin-contaminated area. We believe that with this new strategy, we can provide the producing           companies an eco-friendly way to break down dioxin and bring a better future to human beings.

Public Engagement & Education
Besides doing our project, bringing knowledge of synthetic biology and iGEM to the society is also important                   to us, that is, “go beyond the lab”. By reaching out to the public, we communicated and discussed with                   them about what we can bring to the society and get feedback to make our project meets the needs of the                   public at the same time.
Theory of Knowledge
In order to improve our experiment part, we visited several government agencies, private enterprise, and                   experts related to our project. By discussing with them, we are able to apply the knowledge with greater                   points of view.
Entrepreneurship
Concluded from the visits, we found that heat method, burning down dioxin with high temperature, is the major                   application in industries while microorganism method is rarely used due to the uncertainty and technique                   limitation of application. More research needs to be done before the method can be widely utilized. However,                   once it is being used, numerous advantages is sure to be obtained. Since both the agencies mentioned above                   are eagerly looking forward to our result, it is our later work to collaborate with agencies and bring                   our result out the lab to engineered-applied field.
Conferences & Meet ups
It is always great to have communication with other teams all over the world. By sharing ideas, discussing                   with each other, better approach often came up. Particularly, it is our pleasure to hold 2018 Asia-Pacific                   Conference and get to meet other teams in Taiwan, China, and Japan.
Ethics
For the purpose of getting to know how this highly toxic compound, dioxin, could affect human lives, we went                   to Vietnam in person. This is where we get the idea of doing our project, using microorganism and further                   applied by technique of phytoremediation to break down dioxin.
Environmental Impact
Since dioxin degradation is closely related to the environment, we hope that our project can bring something                   good to our living planet. After visiting some agencies, we got affirmation on the application of our project                   from them and it will surely benefit to the environment.
