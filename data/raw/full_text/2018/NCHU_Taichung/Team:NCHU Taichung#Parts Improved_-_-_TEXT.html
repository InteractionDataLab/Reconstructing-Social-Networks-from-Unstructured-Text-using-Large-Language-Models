Engineered part: BBa_J364007 in pSB1C3 to become a shuttle vector ( BBa_K2546004 , BBa_K2546007 , BBa_K2546008 )
See also " Result ".
This part is an improvement of BBa_J364007 in pSB1C3. The aim of our project is to engineer endophyte for phytoremediation.           To prove our gene work well, we use BBa_J364007, pBBR1, and pMP4657 to get shuttle vector. As phytoremediation           become more popular, the broaden rang plant using plasmid become more important. A great shuttle vector let the           function of gene work well in different genus bacteria. So, making a shuttle vector is not only for our project           but also for other people. pSB1C3 is a common use plasmid. We do a large improve which is changing the Ori of pSB1C3.           We ligate Ori from pBBRMCS, or pMP4657 and the rest of BBa_J364007. Thus, we obtain a vector having prefix and           suffix that can provide cloning gene. We transform BBa_K2546004 in Burkholderia cenocepacia strain 869T2, and test the efficient of green fluorescence protein. By interlab protocol:           Cell growth, sampling, and assay, we can analyze the BBa_K2546004 work.
The follow is the assay of BBa_J364007(pSB1C3) in Escherichia coli, BBa_K2546004-GFP in Escherichia coli, and BBa_K2546004-GFP in Burkholderia cenocepacia strain 869T2
the quantity of GFP performed by BBa_J364007(pSB1C3) in Escherichia coli, BBa_K2546004-GFP in Escherichia coli, and BBa_K2546004-GFP in Burkholderia               cenocepacia Strain 869T2.
The quantity of GFP/per OD performed by BBa_J364007 (pSB1C3) in Escherichia coli, BBa_K2546004-GFP in Escherichia coli, and BBa_K2546004-GFP in Burkholderia cenocepacia Strain 869T2.
