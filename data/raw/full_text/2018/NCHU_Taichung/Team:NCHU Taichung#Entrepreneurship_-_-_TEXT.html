Introduction
Overview
After visiting and having discussions with Houli Refuse Incinerator Plant and China Petrochemical Development Corporation,             we’ve got some ideas about entrepreneurship.

Problem
Concluded from the visits, we found that heat method, burning down dioxin with high temperature, is the major application             in industries while microorganism method is rarely used. This is due to the uncertainty and technique limitation             of applying this method. More research needs to be done before the method can be widely utilized. However, once             it is being used, numerous advantages is sure to be obtained.
Solution
Since both the agencies mentioned above are eagerly looking forward to our result, it is our later work to repeat             the test on our product, collaborate with agencies and bring our result out the lab to engineered-applied level.
Product
According to our project, Engineered Endophyte-Assisted Phytoremediation, we’re putting dioxin-degrade genes into             plant. The plant is our product.

Agency and Enterprise Visit

We saw how garbage is being burned down and in order to avoid the production of dioxin(250 ℃ ~400 ℃ is especially             significant), temperature is being controlled. In addition to this, after garbage is fully burned, two chemicals is formed: incinerator bottom ash and fly ash. Fly ash should be carefully coped with. They use active charcoal             to stabilize fly ash and cleaned out with bottom ash together. Product such as brick is made by mixing ashes             with concrete.
The major method using in the incinerator is heat method, as mentioned previously, breaking down dioxin by extremely             high temperature. They’re interested in the method using in our project, microorganism method. Since dioxin is             hydrophobic, it appears in soil most of the time. If we can successfully applied our method by phytoremediation,             plant would be able to be cropped and break down dioxin in a nature way.

We got the permission to enter the most dioxin-polluted area in the world and got to know procedures they’re applying             to break down dioxin in soil. The major methods are wet method and heat method while microorganism method is             still under breakthrough. Since this method is what we’re doing, they are highly interested in and looking forward             to our application later in the future.
Additionally, we had planted several of our experimental plant (Vetiveria zizanioides) in the area and will test             the concentration of dioxin in the soil to if the plant is sure to break down dioxin few months later.
Analysis
Doubts
The safety of our product should be carefully exercised.
If the product does work, how’s the dioxin degradation rate?
Future Development
Once our product enters market in the future, further achievement and development should be done in order to meet             needs of different companies in different area.
Following is the list:
Increase research and development for higher degradation rate product.
Develop a sensor of testing dioxin concentration that can be easily used under low cost.
Think of proper promoting methods.
Channeling resources into manufacturing to distribute our product on the market.
Examine a faster way to manufacture our product.
