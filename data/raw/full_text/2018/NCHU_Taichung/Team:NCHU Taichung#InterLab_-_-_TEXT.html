Interlab
Introduction
Reliable and standardized units are key point in all disciplines. It just like a language for everyone to understand           the experimental data well. Fortunately, we do have one, that is fluorescence!! fluorescence is very useful in           revealing genetic function and modification. We also can use fluorescence as a marker protein, and then we can           digitalize our experimental data. However, fluorescence data from different people can have diversity. So, the           iGEM’s Fifth International Interlaboratory Study is to test if we can decrease the difference by normalizing to           colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD?

Measurement
Layout for Abs​600​ and Fluorescence measurement. At the end of the experiment, you should have two plates to read. You will have one plate for each time point: 0 and 6 hours. On each plate you will read both fluorescence and absorbance.
Day 5
Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E. coli cultures
This protocol assumes that 1 bacterial cell will give rise to 1 colony.
For the CFU protocol, you will need to count colonies for your two Positive Control (BBa_I20270) cultures and your           two Negative Control (BBa_R0040) cultures
Method:
Starting Sample Preparation:
Add 25 μL culture to 175 μL LB + Cam in a well in a black 96-well plate, with a clear, flat bottom. Each well should             have 200 μL.
Dilute your overnight culture to OD600 = 0.1 in 1mL of LB + Cam media. Do this in triplicate for each culture.
Check the OD600 and make sure it is 0.1.
Dilution Series Instructions
You will need 3 LB Agar + Cam plates (36 total).
Prepare three 2.0 mL tubes (36 total) with 1900 μL of LB + Cam media for Dilutions 1, 2, and 3.
Prepare two 1.5 mL tubes (24 total) with 900 μL of LB + Cam media for Dilutions 4 and 5.
Label each tube according to the figure below (Dilution 1, etc.) for each Starting Sample.
Pipet 100 μL of Starting Culture into Dilution 1. Discard tip. Do NOT pipette up and down. Vortex tube for 5-10             secs.
Repeat Step 5 for each dilution through to Dilution 5 as shown below.
Aseptically spread plate 100 μL on LB + Cam plates for Dilutions 3, 4, and 5.
Incubate at 37°C overnight and count colonies after 18-20 hours of growth.
CFU/mL/OD Calculation Instructions
Count the colonies on each plate with fewer than 300 colonies.
Multiple the colony count by the Final Dilution Factor on each plate.
