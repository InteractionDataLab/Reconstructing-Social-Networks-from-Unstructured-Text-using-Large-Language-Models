        </P><DIV class="ui left aligned dividing header">
          1. Why can we clean up the soil with endophyte?
        </DIV><P>To ensure dioxins will be absorbed by the plant and degraded by endophyte, we used the modeling of plant uptake of
          dioxins. Besides, we used the model to define which parameters determined the absorbency of the plant, and took them
          into account for choosing the plant in our project.
        </P><DIV class="ui left aligned dividing header">
          2. How do the proteins perform in our project?
        </DIV><P>We created a docking simulation of proteins in our project, including TonB, HAD and Laccase, and compared the results
          of each protein-ligand interation. Moreover, we combined the docking result and the gene design to make our project
          more rationality..
        </P><DIV class="ui left aligned dividing header">
          3. Whether do our project have economic value?
        </DIV><P>In this part, we concerned the two aspects of economic values: land recycling and biomass fuel. We used the model to
          demonstrate the profit of phytoremediation, and boosted profits by gene design.
        </P><H2 class="ui header" id="Q1">Q1 : Why can we clean up the soil with endophyte?</H2><P>The largest feature of endophyte is living within a plant. As a result, we must validate if dioxins will be efficiently
          absorbed by root and accumulate. Otherwise, there is nothing to talk about.
        </P><P>To answer that, we used the soil to vegetation bioconcentration factor (BCF
          <SUB>sv</SUB>) as an indicator to show the ratio between the concentration in the soil and plant.
          <A href="#ref1"><SUP>[1]</SUP></A> The BCF is the ratio of the concentration of a chemical in an organism to the concentration in the surrounding environment
          at steady state. It is a valuable indicator of bioaccumulation potential of a substance.
        </P><P>The dioxin BCF
          <SUB>sv</SUB> values have been tested with crops by Jarrad and Smith.
          <A href="#ref1"><SUP>[2]</SUP></A></P><DIV class="ui image" id="labelImg"><DIV class="ui bottom attached label">Table. 1.    17 types of the most toxic dioxins BCFsv values</DIV></DIV><P>We found that the BCF
          <SUB>sv</SUB> ranged from 3.17E-0 to 6.51E-03. Although, the result represented dioxins were indeed absorbed by the plant.
          The values are far below expectations. As a result, we used the model of the concentration in plant shoot via root
          uptake by Trapp and Matthies,
          <A href="#ref3"><SUP>[3]</SUP></A> shown as bellow, to find the way to improve BCF
          <SUB>sv</SUB>.
        </P><P>When we used this model to calculate BCF
          <SUB>sv</SUB>, \(\text{d}C_{\text{leaf}} \over \text{d}t\) should be 0 at steady state. Hence, we needed to decrease \(α_{\text{soil}}\)
          or increase \(β_{\text{soil}}\) as we asked for the higher value of \(C_{\text{leaf}}\).
        </P><P>where</P><P>Because \( K_{\text{plant growth}}\) was lack of data, we chose Q, TSCF, and \(V_{\text{leaf}}\) as the condition to
          ask the higher value of \(β_{\text{soil}}\). From the common plants for phytoremediation, Vetiver exactly meets the
          conditions. It has thin leaves and the high transpiration rate which cause the higher value of \(β_{\text{soil}}\).
          We compared Vetiver with crops, used by Jarrad and Smith. The Q, TSCF, and \(V_{\text{leaf}}\) of Vetiver are apparently
          greater than crop. Therefore, we used Vetiver in our project, believed that would greatly improve the BCF
          <SUB>sv</SUB> values.
        </P><H2 class="ui header" id="Q2">Q2 : How do the proteins perform in our project?</H2><P>In our project, we use the three protein, including TonB, HAD, and Laccase, to degradation dioxins. First, TonB takes
          dioxins in the endophyte. Then, HAD dehalogenases dioxins. Final, Laccase opens the ring and transfers into the carbon
          source.
        </P><DIV class="ui image" id="labelImg"><DIV class="ui bottom attached label"><B><I>Fig. 1.</I></B>    Pathway of the project</DIV></DIV><P>To understand the performance of each stage, we used the online modeling tool, SWISS model, to compare, simulate and
          create the 3D model of each protein. Then, we used iGEMDOCK to calculate 17 types of the most toxic dioxins pose
          energy as ligands with TonB and HAD. Because we only used TCDD as the ligand in wet lab, and we had confirmed TonB
          and HAD can wok with TCDD, we compared the pose energy between TCDD and other dioxins. We tried to predict our project
          if it can work with other dioxins types.
        </P><P>As for Laccase, we compared the pose energy of Laccase binding with dioxins and product of HAD. From the previous studies,
          we had known HAD can release the halogen and replace it with hydroxy. However, the exact product of HAD is still
          unknown. Accordingly, we used 40 types of dioxin compounds with hydroxy to test pose energy with Laccase.

          the plant will grow deeper and wider because Laccase will generate more carbon source, and the absorption efficiency
          will hugely boost. This result will also indirectly lead the improvement of economic value mentioned in below section.</P><H2 class="ui header" id="Q3">
          Q3 : Whether do our project have economic value or not?
        </H2><P>Our project can degrade dioxins in soil. The obvious value is the probability of land recycling. After remediation
          has been achieved, the potential financial return crop production. Besides, we can turn the plant into the biomass
          production. Because of the engineered endophyte work, dioxins are degraded, and the plant can be treated as the clean
          source of biomass.</P><P>The preliminary model was developed to show the economic benefit of our project. Therefore in our approach, the following
          assumptions were used: The landlord plans to continue his land activities for a period of 20 years. The production
          of biomass which can be combined with the phytoremediation for 6 years (which is the period that is needed to clean
          the soil) and the production of crops in the years 7-20. The economic benefit model is calculated by:</P><P>where</P><P>We used the model, Biomass Enterprise Economic Model, created by Oregon State University - College of Forestry to calculate
          the economic profit of biomass. The model simulated the scale of the economics of biomass enterprise. We used Vetiver
          as the biomass source. The relation parameter of Vetiver was assumed bellow:
        </P><LI value="・">Water content is 30%</LI><LI value="・">Plant over 15 hectare, and produce 90 tons per hectare per year </LI><LI value="・">Have a btu-value of 7,000btu/lb </LI><LI value="・">Worth US$2.50/MMbtu</LI><P>We entered the data into the model. The window of model was shown bellow:</P><P>The reslut of simulation was:</P><P>The result indicated the payback of the biomass might be a deficit. For six years remediation, we would have a deficit
          of US 31.2. However, the current remediation techniques, thermal desoption, are more expensive. The costs associated
          with thermal desorption treatment approximately are US 30,000,000 in the same case.
          <A href="#ref5"><SUP>[5]</SUP></A></P><P>For increasing the economic value of our project, we can enhance the grown rate of Vetiver to increase the yield of
          biomass. Laccase just meets the requirement. Laccase turns dioxins into the carbon source and gives the plant growth
          nutrition. Besides, HAD can improve the efficiency of Laccase mentioned above. Therefore, we expected that Laccase
          will greatly increase the economic profit of our project.
        </P><H2 class="ui header" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</H2><P>1. Dioxins can well accumulate in our project plant, Vetiver.</P><P>2. TonB is fit to all common types of dioxins, and HAD can bind with the majority. And HAD can improve the efficiency
          of Laccase.</P><P>
          3. Our project have two economic values: biomass and land recycling. In addition, Laccase can increase the profit of our
          project.
