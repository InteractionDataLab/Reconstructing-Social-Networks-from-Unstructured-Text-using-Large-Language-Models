THE RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS ON VETIVER
Phenotype Comparison
Figure 1. Vetiver+TCDD+869T2
Figure 2. Vetiver+TCDD
Before the experiment was started, vetiver plants were transplanted from field to greenhouse and grew under the same           settings for 30 days. After the above pretreatment, we started the experiments with triple replication of four           different treatment (Table 1) and then having analyses on some observable phenotypic characteristics.

We found that if we inoculate vetiver plants with B. cenocepacia 869T2, the bacteria will decrease the length of leaves but increase the number of tillers and           leaves; inhibit the grow of main roots but enhance the strong lateral roots’ formation (we also see the same influence           during the experiment of Arabidopsis thaliana). (Figure1 - Figure7)
Vetiver plants will get some negative influence when facing to TCDD stress. For example, their leaves number, leaves           length, and roots length will not grow well as where growing under the general condition without TCDD. However,           not only as above mentioned that Vetiver plants' leaves number and tiller will dramatically increase when they           are inoculated with endophytic bacteria B. cenocepacia 869T2 but if the vetiver plants are also in the TCDD treatment in same time, this effect seems           quite more obvious.
Therefore, we can understand that the endophytic bacteria B. cenocepacia strain 869T2 can not only survive in high TCDD concentration condition and do some positive           effect on its host but also can use the TCDD as a kind of resource for itself to achieve something that still unrevealed.

ENDOPHYTIC BACTERIA EXIST RECHECK
Figure 8. Recheck of 30 days after endophytic bacteria inoculation.
On day 30, we harvested the vetiver plants for rechecking whether endophytic bacteria still exist.
First, we used bleach, EtOH, and sterile water to surface-sterilize plants. Second, we ground the vetiver plants           completely and dilute the ground liquid with 10 times, and then spread it into LB agar plate for culturing the           target bacteria. Last, we observe the morphology of a single colony to check the two bacteria. A single colony           of B. cenocepacia 869T2 is small, circular, entire, raised, glistening veined, yellow-green. Also, there have           no any bacteria present in the control sample.
Accordingly, we know that B. cenocepacia 869T2 has a great endophytic character and can live in vetiver plants for at least 30 days during           our experiment.
Analysis of TCDD concentration in plants
The concentration of dioxin in the plant samples in our experiment was tested by Worthies Engineering Consultant           Co., Ltd. according to the "Test Method for Dioxin and Polychlorinated Biphenyl Residues in Food (CNS 14758 N6369)"           published by the MOHW of Executive Yuan.
As the following report presents, the sample which had not been inoculated with B. cenocepacia 869T2 but planted in TCDD contained matrix directly was be detected that having 343.253 pg/g           TCDD concentration (Table 2) ; the sample which had been inoculated with B. cenocepacia 869T2 and then planted in TCDD contained matrix was be detected that having 2.12257 pg/g TCDD           concentration (Table 3) .
The vetiver plants inoculated with B. cenocepacia 869T2 shows about 162 times less TCDD concentration than the plants didn't be inoculated. Based           on this result, it becomes much more solid for us to point out that the endophytic bacteria B. cenocepacia 869T2 has the super strong TCDD degradation ability and therefore has the highly potential to           act an extremely important role in our program.

Arabidopsis thaliana after 10 days TCDD exposure and Burkholderia cenocepacia 869T2 inoculation.
We analyzed the effects of 2, 3, 7, 8-TCDD on the growth of A. thaliana for 14 days. Morphologically, the roots and leaves of A. thaliana are very different: First, the difference between the control plants(TCDD-) and the experimental           plants (TCDD+) is 15 mm. The experimental plants are twice shorter than the control plants. ( Fig. 1a) Second,           the experimental plants are smaller and weaker than the control plants. ( Fig. 1b) This information indicated that           the existence of TCDD provoked important morphological difference in A. thaliana. In another result of experiment, we also find the roots of the A. thaliana inoculated with Burkholderia cenocepacia 869T2 are particularly different: their roots are short but very strong, their leaves           are small but dark green. And the most difference is that inhibit the grow of main roots but enhance the strong           lateral roots. ( Fig. 2) This information can be used as a reference in the future.

We test two endophitic bacteria ( Burkholderia cenocepacia 869T2 and Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN) how long they exist in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the beginning, we inoculate B. cenocepacia 869T2 and B. phytofirmans PsJN with OD600=0.4 into Arabidopsis plants. On the seventh and fourteenth day, we collect the sample of experiment. Before grinding           the plants, we wash them for sterile water and confirm whether we wash the surface bacteria on Arabidopsis plants. Then, we grind the Arabidopsis plants and dilute their liquid with 10 times, and put it to LB plate for 30℃ during a day. After           a day, we observe the morphology of a single colony to check the two bacteria. A single colony of B. cenocepacia 869T2 is small, circular, entire, raised, glistening veined, yellow-green, and B. phytofirmans PsJN is very small, circular, entire, raised, rough, white. (the right picture of Fig. 3) The           result was consistent with a single colony of two bacteria. Moreover, the washing water does not see any bacteria.           (the left picture of Fig. 3) Therefore, no matter which bacteria with or without TCDD plate in Arabidopsis plants they stay, all of two show the endophytic character in Arabidopsis plants.
Screen of HAD activity
We have a substrate called 2-chloropropionic acid (2-CPA) for HAD activity test.HAD can take off chloride anion from           the substrate;thus, we can then add silver cation to the solution to form silver chloride,which is white precipitate.When           silver chloride is exposed to light,it will become hydrogen gas and silver.Therefore, if the solution contains           more chloride anion,the color of silver will be deeper.

Toxicology-Cell Viability Test
MTT assay
Viability of cells was assessed by measuring the formation of a formazan from MTT spectrophotometric assay test,           modified after Mosmann’s (1983) study. HEP G2 were incubated with 0.5 mg/mL MTT for 2 hours at 37°C at the end           of the experiment. After washing with DMSO, the purple formazan was extracted from cells and was photometrically           determined at 595 nm.
Results (36hrs)
The results of cell viability measured by MTT assay is shown in Figure 1. After incubating in CO 2 incubator for 36 hours and assayed in vitro on the HEP G2 cells using the MTT assay, the values for the           0.25, 12.5 and 62.5 nM TCDD-treated cells ranged from 0.34-to 0.18-fold lower than that for the primary human HEP           G2, respectively. However, the two concentrations of HAD (10, and 20μM) provided in vitro activities on cell viability           against the tested TCDD compound. As the following picture, the decrease in the level of enzyme reached statistical           significance at 10, and 20μM concentrations of DHA against TCDD toxicity.

Improved part
Engineer part: BBa_J364007 in pSB1C3 to become a shuttle vector (BBa_K2546004)
Using restriction enzyme and Polymerase Chain Reaction, we replace the Ori of BBa_J364007 in pSB1C3. This make plasmid           become a shuttle vector which can replicate in broad host range. Checking this plasmid with EcoRI and PstI or XbaI           and SpeI to see if the plasmid be cut off. By two groups of restriction enzymes, the result will get two band:5389bp           and 1100bp (figure 1). It is also an evidence shows that our plasmid have prefix and suffix. With prefix and suffix,           anyone can easily use our vector to perform the function of gene well. Moreover, we use interlab protocol ‘Cell           growth, sampling, and assay’, to test the performance of Green Fluorescent Protein(GFP) of BBa_K2546004-GFP. The           result reveals that BBa_K2546004-GFP can express GFP well in Burkholderia cenocepacia Strain 869T2. It even have much higher efficient to express GFP than the original           plasmid: BBa_J364007 in pSB1C3 in Escherichia coli(figure 2,figure 3). Therefore, we prove BBa_J364007 in pSB1C3 to replicate in Burkholderia cenocepacia Strain 869T2, and prove the efficient of expressing GFP.

The Growth of Recombinant Bacteria in TCDD Medium
The growth curves of the recombinant bacteria under different TCDD concentration treatments were tested to dissect           the functions.
Single gene construct
Both pET24a/HAD construct and the vector control pET24a grew similar in the medium without TCDD . The strain HAD             construct display better growth compare to control with 0.05ppm, 0.1ppm TCDD treatment (Fig. 1). This result             indicated that HAD promoted the bacteria growth under TCDD treatment as expect.
Fig. 1. Growth of the control strain pET24A and the recombinant train HAD in 0ppm, 0.05ppm, 0.1ppm, 0.2ppm TCDD medium
pET21b/TonB construct grew worse under higher concentration (0.1ppm, 0.2ppm) of TCDD than the lower one (0ppm,             0.05ppm) (Fig. 2 ) . It may result from the transporter protein TonB that intake TCDD may be toxic to the cell.
Fig. 2. Growth of the control strain pET21b and the recombinant train TonB in 0ppm, 0.05ppm, 0.1ppm, 0.2ppm TCDD medium.
The growth of strain TLcc declined in high TCDD concentration (Fig. 3). In our hypothesis, TLcc degrades TCDD,             but it’s possible that the free radical attack the ring structure and cause damages to bacteria as shown in our             results.
Fig. 3. Growth of the control strain pET21b and the recombinant train TLcc in 0ppm, 0.05ppm, 0.1ppm, 0.2ppm TCDD medium.
Dual genes
The growth of strain HAD+TonB didn’t show defect impact compared to control (pET24a+pET21b) under high TCDD concentration             (Fig. 4). The growth of HAD+TLcc (J23100) displayed slightly inhibited by TCDD compare to control J23100 (Fig.             5). These results may indicate that the two construct, HAD+TonB and HAD+TLcc, function in the bacteria that detoxify             TCDD.

Fig. 5. Growth of the control strain J23100 and the recombinant strain HAD+TLcc (J23100), in 0ppm, 0.05ppm, 0.1ppm, 0.2ppm TCDD medium.
Three genes construct (tested pathway)
TonB+HAD+TLcc (J23100) had better growth with 0, 0.05, 0.1ppm TCDD treatment (Fig. 6). This indicated that the             toxicity effect of TCDD can be detoxified due to the synergistic functions of the three genes-the uptake of TonB             transporter, reduced by HAD enzyme, and breaking down by the laccase.

The toluene is taken as the solvent control of TCDD which didn’t cause much influence to the growth of bacteria             (Fig. 7).
