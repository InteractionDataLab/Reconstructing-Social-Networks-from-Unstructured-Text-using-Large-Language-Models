                                        on the practical and social considerations involved in the application of our project in industry.

Basically, the best condition for engineered <I>E. coli</I> to capture CO<SUB>2</SUB> have to be lower, without too much SOx and NOx particles. 
                                        However, we won’t be able to provide an ideal culture condition in industrial application. 
                                        After researching the tolerance of <I>E. coli</I>, we concluded that <I>E. coli</I> is possible to survive in factory condition while the concentration of SOx and NOx were much lower than CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Besides, we will dilute the concentration with gas that the small fraction of SOx NOx can only effect the expression of <I>E. coli</I>. 
                                        In other words, it may not capture as much CO<SUB>2</SUB> as culture in the lab.

                                        we should optimize the condition to maximize the carbon fixation ability of the microbes.
