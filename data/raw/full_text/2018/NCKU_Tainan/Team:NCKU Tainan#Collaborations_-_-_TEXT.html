During the time we designed a flow chart for our CO2 utilization system for                                     application. We were lucky to find our friend, UESTC-China , to work together and                                     end up building a completely eco-friendly system with negative carbon footprint.
We tried to figure out another way in carbon utilization as an                                         contribution of carbon reduction and save energy. However, we face some problem                                         when we tried to apply our Engineering E. coli into industrial scale. Cost                                         evaluation and carbon footprint are big challenges                                         When we were designing the whole CO2 utilization system. We were delighted when                                         we found out someone who will be able to resolve our problems. UESTC-China mainly                                          focused on degrading straw into useful raw materials, including glucose, xylose,                                          ferule acid, and lignin. In addition, they aimed to convert glucose into butanol                                          and hydrogen. As xylose is the main carbon source for our                                         engineered E. coli, we came up with a collaboration idea by integrating our                                         system at the downstream of their system. Xylose is one of the side product                                         produced during straw degradation, it can be extracted and utilized in our                                         system. Concerning the synthesis of xylose may produce greenhouse gas and                                         chemicals, we would like to obtain xylose produced via biological method.
Through UESTC system, xylose will be produced in their fermentation broth as well as                                          other three raw material. In order to calculate the amount of xylose production,                                          they tested the ferulic acid which yield by gas chromatography (GC) after 12 hours.                                          Basically, ferulic acid cover for 1.15% of straw.                                          Then, the enzyme activity of ferulic acid degradation can be calculated.                                          Next, we assume that the rate of xylan decomposition is the same                                          as that of ferulic acid while 30% of xlyan composed of straw.                                          Finally, through derivation, we can get 0.0348 kg xylose from 1 kg straw.                                          The detail progress of calculation was listed below.
Sample ：20ml, positive control and 0.3g corn straw was added,                                          Abs600 was not certain because we had added straw.
Ferulic acid by GC ： 0.53 mg / L
Ferulic acid in straw：0.3 g * 1.15% = 0.345 mg
Ferulic acid degradation rate：(0.53 * 20*10-3)/0.345 = 10.6%
Xylose in 1kg straw ： 1kg * 30% * 10.6% = 0.0348 kg
With NCKU system, E. coli consumed xylose to uptake CO2.                                          The xylose consumption was 23.864 kg to uptake 1kg of CO2.                                          In conclusion, every 685 kg straw can be used to capture 1 kg CO2.                                          In other words, capturing 1% annual CO2 emission of                                          small and medium enterprise, which is 20 tons CO2 require 16 tons straw.
Straw was a biowaste in agriculture while it wasn't easy to decompose.                                         UESTC-China solved this problem with synthetic biology successfully.                                         Through our collaboration, they can not only produce bioenergy, but have                                         another powerful application in CO2 emission problem. NCKU-Tainan provided them                                         a valuable and also applicable way and helped them design a draft of device.                                          The xylose source from straw was really important to E. coli CO2 utilization system                                          which changed the positive carbon footprint into negative carbon footprint.                                         CO2 emission problems is a big issue in the world. The main solution can be                                         separated into two part, CO2 downstream processing and Alternative Energy. Both                                         NCKU-Tainan and UESTC-China contribute to this serious issue and our                                         collaboration could solve both the energy problem and environment problem.
Tec-Monterrey
We have a video meeting with Tec-Monterrey . After introducing our project to                                         them, they had pointed out some aspects that we need to consider. They reminded                                         us to think about our end product which can make our project more complete.
During the meeting, we came up with the idea to collaborate with each other.                                         Their project has two parts. The main part is E-coding, which use E. coli to                                         store data. Another part is to sense the pollutant in river of Mexico, which is                                         the part that we could link our work. We had constructed a pH sensing biobrick                                         which express fluorescence under low pH condition, they suggest us to                                         incorporate our pH sensing construct in their pollutant sensing system, making                                         their system become more complete. Therefore, we shared our plasmid map and                                         construction protocol with them, which they can be used to construct the                                         biobrick in the future.
Also, we found out that the new combined sensing system can be applied in our                                         bioreactor as they aim to sense pollutants such as nitrate, phosphate or heavy                                         metals. This will be a useful alert system for our bioreactor since the flue                                         gas may contain pollutants especially heavy metals that are highly toxic to the E. coli.
Through this collaboration, we not only combined two sensing system, expanding                                         its application field, but we also found a more complete sensing system for our                                         device.
