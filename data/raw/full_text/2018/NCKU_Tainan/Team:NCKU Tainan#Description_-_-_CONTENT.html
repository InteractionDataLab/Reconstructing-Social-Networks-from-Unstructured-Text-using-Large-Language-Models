                                        (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) with the approach of synthetic biology. 
We constructed a carbon fixing <I>E. coli</I> by cloning enzymes from Calvin cycle into it. We measured the function of each enzyme in the pathway and proved that the engineered pathway can utilize carbon.
                                        Our team has also designed a bioreactor. The bioreactor contains an air valve in which we can pump the CO<SUB>2</SUB>. The bioreactor is also monitored by sensors that will send the data to a cloud database. Combining IoT and synthetic biology, we believe that our device can be applied to industrial settings. 
                                        To promote our design as well as synthetic biology, we have discussed with numerous experts in various professions and visit the entrepreneurship that is willing to apply our design. We received countless feedbacks and improve our project. We believe that people should be aware of CO<SUB>2</SUB>. We also believe that our project can help the society to get one step closer towards a low carbon society.

                                        For example, glacier retreats, which contributes to the rise of sea level and the decrease of habitable land. Besides, the rise of temperature accelerates the chemical reaction in the sea, depleting the coral reef and lead to the unbalanced marine ecosystem. The frequency of natural disaster has drastically increased over the past few decades. If the global temperature rises 1 degree Celcius, one-third of the land will be lack of freshwater. 2 degrees Celcius, over millions of species will go extinct. 4 degrees Celcius, the glacier in the Northpole will melt completely.

                                        As one of the members of the global village, our team, 
                                        NCKU_Tainan thinks that we should enroll ourselves in reducing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). This year, our team have designed a new way to utilize one of the GHGs, 
                                        CO<SUB>2</SUB>, by using an advanced and modern technique nowadays, Synthetic Biology.
