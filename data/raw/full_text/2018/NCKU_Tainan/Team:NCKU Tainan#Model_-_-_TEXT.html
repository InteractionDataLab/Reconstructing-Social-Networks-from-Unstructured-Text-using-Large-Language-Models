Achievement Purpose Method CO2 uptake CO2 metabolism Analysis References
Achievement
Figure out how much CO2 uptake into the E.coli to make our project more effective.
We will realize how much carbon we can fix in our project.
In order to achieve these two goals, we try to figure out three main questions：
Amount of CO2 uptake by E. coli
CO2 flux in E. coli metabolism
Amount of Carbon fixed in biomass
Purpose
We aim to develop the biological model to make our experimental data more useful, even more effective to achieve the optimization parameters in the model.                                          Therefore, we can save time to try and error on doing experiment.                                          After that, we analyze the rate of production and consumption.                                          In this way, we can calculate the amount of CO2 uptake into the Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) and                                          calculate how much CO2 will be used in our system.                                          In addition, we also want to realize how much carbon being fixed in our system.                                          We have to understand the process in E. coli after uptaking                                          CO2.                                          Since we integrated non-native carbon fixation pathway into E. coli to let E. coli utilize CO2,                                          we simplify the CO2 utilization pathway in engineered E. coli into two parts, CO2 uptake and CO2 metabolism .

CO2 uptake
CO2 exists in the phase of gas.                                          Therefore, E. coli uptake CO2 by diffusion.                                          However, the native diffusion rate is really low, not to mention the dissolved rate.                                          We clone CA (carbonic anhydrase) gene to speed up the diffusion rate.                                          The higher diffusion rate, the higher CO2 concentration maintained in engineered E. coli.                                          Higher CO2 concentration in engineered E. coli provides more steady CO2 condition for downstream pathway.

Result
Enzyme, CA, strongly catalyzes the hydration of CO2 and its interaction appears to                                                  follow a Michaelis-Menten mechanism with a Hill constant of 0.0062 in our research.                                                  The result of Engineered E. coli cloned with or without CA gene showed below.                                                  A quite different diffusion time explains the function of CA.

CO2 Metabolism
Xylose is the main source of our engineered E. coli to uptake CO2.                                          However, there is another pathway for xylose metabolism,                                          which means that there is only a part of xylose that E. coli consumed will react with CO2.                                          We build a model to predict the different carbon flux between original xylose metabolism, PP pathway (Pentose Phosphate pathway) , and our CO2 bypass pathway .
Both of two pathways will end up at pyruvate,                                          which is a key intersection in the network of metabolic pathways.                                          We built a model of TCA cycle to explain how pyruvate play an energy precursor role and then                                          is converted into biomass of E. coli.

Xylose v.s. CO2 analysis in CO2 utilization efficiency
Two main sources of CO2 metabolism in engineered E. coli are xylose and CO2.                                                  CO2 utilization rate varies under different condition.                                                  We use 5% CO2 (about 2.6 mM) and 4 (g/l) xylose (about 26 mM) in experiment as an optimization CO2 utilization rate.                                                  Constant CO2 condition and limited CO2 condition also effects metabolism performance.                                                  In other words, open system and close system showed different results. Therefore, adjust initial concentration of CO2 and Xylose and choose open or close system to see the change of pyruvate production.
