May 2018, NCKU_Tainan team went to HWSH to promote synthetic biology                                                 and our iGEM project. 20                                                 students joined this program. Most of them enjoyed the interesting                                                 experiment they had never tried before.
Why We Choose HWSH?

Their school educational program involves international exchange                                                 programs, clubs, science fair,                                                 which are flipped classrooms in Taiwanese education system.
How We Proceed ?
Before 5/21, we have contacted teachers in HWSH. Their teacher                                                 scheduled our program into their                                                 biology classes (08:00-10:00). Three of our members participated in                                                 this program. We shared our                                                 college life and demonstrated how our training from out major                                                 contributed to our project in                                                 the team at first. We then introduced iGEM and the job of four                                                 compartments. We also went through                                                 our the idea and the concept of our project. For the last session of                                                 our program, we introduce some                                                 basic concept of the biological experiment, several important model                                                 organisms in synthetic biology,                                                 and the concept of Gram stain. We also teach them how to handle pipette                                                 precisely. In the final 40                                                 minutes, it’s time for them to apply what they have learned to the                                                 experiment! We prepared the                                                 sealed slides of Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile in our lab.                                                 After connecting the optical                                                 microscope with CCD camara , the live image was projected to the screen                                                 and the whole class could                                                 observed the morphology of the bacteria. Students are totally exciting                                                 when they sucked liquid from                                                 pipette successfully. They also asked us questions about our project and gave us lots of useful                                                 feedback! After this program, we received a message from a lovely                                                 student, who was burned the                                                 passion for synthetic biology and want to join iGEM when she enters the                                                 college.

How We Proceed ?
Before 6/12, we have contacted teachers in the Affiliated Elementary                                                 School of NNKIEH. Their                                                 teacher scheduled our program into their science classes (09:00-11:00)                                                 and we had one our to launch                                                 our slide and the materials of the experiment. Three of our members                                                 participated in this program.                                                 First, we had twenty minutes for our lecture, which we introduced the                                                 basic concept of the cell                                                 included the structure of the cell and the level of the organism. Than,                                                 the students observed the                                                 different kinds of cells specimen under the microscope. After the                                                 observation, we prepared an                                                 experiment for them. We instructed them the step to extract their own                                                 DNA by some materials in the                                                 common life. After the program, we had ten minutes for review the                                                 lecture and let them write it                                                 down.
Experimental Procedure:
Step 1: Add several drops of liquid dish soap and 2 tbsp of salt into                                                 20ml of water. Set aside, you                                                 will need it later. Step 2: Squeeze juice from pineapple! (Tips: You may squeeze it with a                                                 towel) Step 3: Gargle with 20ml of drinking water for 1 minute. (Make sure you                                                 do this step well to get                                                 sufficient oral cells) After that, split it back into a tube/ clear                                                 plastic cup. Step 4: Mix the solution you have prepared in step 1 with the oral cell                                                 containing solution. Stir                                                 it gently, avoid causing bubbles from the soap.

Today, we were so glad to have lunch with our president Dr.                                                 Huey-Jen Jenny Su from NCKU. Our                                                 meeting time was the day before our semester presentation, so we were excited to tell the president                                                 what we going to do. Since the president has been our                                                 important support from the first year of                                                 igem-NCKU three years ago, we had a great time about                                                 introducing all the 2018 team members to                                                 president. We mentioned about why we want to join the igem                                                 competition and what we expect to do in                                                 the following 6 months. After listening our background and                                                 some challenges we may face, she showed                                                 a lot of concerned and gave us a lot of advises which                                                 really encourage us.

We seized this chance                                                 to make an effort to expose iGEM to                                                 people.
What we done are as follows:
Designing a synthetic biology – related game for them                                                 to                                                 play.
Explaining what iGEM is for everyone.
Using Facebook and intasgram for the lucky draw                                                 on-the-spot                                                 to enhance event delight.
Inquiring people’s comments about our idea.
designing biological-related game for students.
We hope that we can use interesting games and community                                                 interaction to let                                                 students know what synthetic biology is. Also, it is a                                                 great opportunity to let more NCKU students                                                 and                                                 high school student know there is such an awesome                                                 competition in Boston. As for our team, we                                                 enjoyed                                                 all process during iGEM competition period!

iGEM NCKU has applied for becoming a synthetic biology cub in NCKU. In                                                 this day, we went around to                                                 promote iGEM NCKU and explain our research space presently such that                                                 more students get interest in                                                 what iGEM is.
We have our stand where we displaying our poster to show what iGEM is                                                 to students. We left the                                                 contact information to students who have interest in iGEM competition.                                                 We also go around at random                                                 greeting people and introducing iGEM to others passionately. Some                                                 student inquired question about                                                 iGEM and exclaimed in admiration to our explain. We made every effort                                                 to explain iGEM-related                                                 answer to them.
We attracted students and aroused their curiosity successfully. All of                                                 our team enjoyed this Club                                                 Fair well and had more motivation to study our brainstorming.
2018 The First Presentation
On March 13, we had our first presentation about our brainstorming. We                                         presented our brainstorming in order to let people and professors to realize                                         our idea and vote one of our idea to become our final project.

On March 13, we had our first presentation about our                                                 brainstorming. We presented our brainstorming                                                 in order to let people and professors to realize our idea                                                 and vote one of our idea to become our                                                 final project.
We had three topics, including cleaning up oil spill,                                                 detection of pathogens and carbon capture.                                                 Each group had twenty minutes to present their idea, then                                                 we entered the Q&A stage, which made each                                                 group more realize their problem and blind spot so that                                                 they had do more work and brainstorming to                                                 solve these problem.
After our presentation, we obtained lots of feedback. In                                                 addition, we met NCTU iGEM team after our                                                 semester presentation. We had our dinner together and                                                 talked about our project. Since NCTU team and                                                 we hadn’t set our mind on solving specific problem, we made                                                 some wide discussion about agricultural                                                 and environmental issues in Taiwan. We also talked about                                                 our team composition the way how we                                                 recruit our team members.
We had a pleasant time exchanging our ideas and chatting                                                 with each other. We believed that we could                                                 build up cooperation relationship in the iGEM competition.
iGEM Promotion in NCKU

NCKU Spring medical speech is an annual One-Day-camp for the high                                                 school students who is interested                                                 in medical school in Taiwan. Through this camp, high school students                                                 have opportunities to closely                                                 contact with all kinds of departments related to medical. Since the                                                 first year of NCKU igem team                                                 establish, NCKU college of medicine have given a lot of support and                                                 many students in college of                                                 medicine joined iGEN competition. Therefore, NCKU igem team were                                                 invited by department of medicine                                                 and Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology to share                                                 our experience in iGEM                                                 competition. Through this speech, we could spread our passion in iGEM                                                 to all the high school                                                 students.
2016 iGEM_NCKU “UNO” designed a non-invasive blood glucosemeter in                                                 synthetic biological way. The                                                 next year, 2017 iGEM_NCKU "NO problem" made an nitrate sensor boat to                                                 deal with the aquaculture                                                 problem. This year, 2018 iGEM_NCKU aim to change the sequence of E.                                                 coli gene to run a more                                                 efficiency method in biological carbon capture. We gave some basic                                                 knowledge about synthetic                                                 biology to high school students, and what we learn during paper review                                                 in iGEM competition,                                                 synthetic biology, and whole CO2 problem. In addition, interdeparmental                                                 collaboration is a key                                                 feature of NCKU. Through iGEM, medical student can have more                                                 communication with other students came                                                 from different departments. Besides, we all gain a great sense of                                                 achievement after we finish the                                                 whole project which is not only a result of research, but a complete                                                 final product that we can show                                                 all the audiences.
After the speech, many students showed their interest on iGEM. We also received recognition for                                                 giving a briefly introduction from chairmen of department of medicine                                                 and Department of Medical                                                 Laboratory Science and Biotechnology who invited us.

On October, 6 Our team participated in the Biotechnology Green Energy                                                 Expo. There are many stands which could be divided into Biotechnology,                                                 Green energy and Innovative production. In addition, we also joined the                                                 NEP-II Technology Workshop and Matchmaking Conference.
We chose Multi-fuel pure oxygen combustion reduction and Advanced                                                 carbon capture combustion technology which have closely related to our                                                 project. Interestingly, we found that in the such business matchmaking                                                 conference involved in many vendor, most of them focused more on what                                                 benefit they create rather than the detailed technology process.
It is important that when we want to apply our projects in practice, we                                                 have to understand our product strengths, potential client and other                                                 resources which benefit our idea. Besides, using the government                                                 resources to receive subsidies also can make our research go more well                                                 , and improve our product visibility at the same time.
