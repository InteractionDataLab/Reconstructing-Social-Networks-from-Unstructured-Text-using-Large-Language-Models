Motivation Experiments Wiring
About this section, we are showing how to use the Wi-Fi module in arduino.
Motivation
In order to send data to firebase, we use Wi-Fi module to upload it.
Experiments
Purpose
We need to send data from one sensor to another one. We would like                                                 to send the Arduino sensor data to Wi-Fi module, and send the Wi-Fi                                                 time data to Arduino.
Method
We use Arduino TX to send sensor data to Wi-Fi RX, then upload data to database .                                                 And we use Wi-Fi TX to send time data to Arduino RX, then print it on                                                 LCD.
Wi-Fi (Node mcu) Code
Precaution
Because we cannot send data by float, so we need to separate the data before                                                  and after the decimal. For instance, 25.35 may be send by 25 and 35. Then merge                                                  it on another sensor. For instance, 25.35 may be merged by 25 + 0.01 * 35
Result
We send an array which is 25.35、26.56、27.54 from Arduino to Wi-Fi module. And                                                  we let the Wi-Fi module Serial to print the data which are send separately.                                                  Then we merge the data to what it should be originally.
We check the format of the header and end of the packet and also check if there                                                  are 6 values in each packet. If it had, we translate the contents of the packet                                                  into pH value, temperature and CO2 concentration, and upload the translated                                                  result to the cloud.
