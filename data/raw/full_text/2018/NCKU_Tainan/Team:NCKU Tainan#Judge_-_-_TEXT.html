Bronze
1. Registration and Giant Jamboree Attendance
We have all registered for undergraduate team in 2018 iGEM.
2. Competition Deliverables
Follow the Deliverables page in iGEM：
We create a wiki ,                                          including Attributions page.                                         Product a poster to show in the Jamboree. Prepare the presentation for the Jamboree.                                         We submitted judging form and safety form by the deadline.                                         Also we have a Safety page in wiki.
3. Attributions
We got a lot of help from professors and other people and we noted them in Attributions page in wiki.
4. Characterization / Contribution
Our project aims to capture carbon dioxide and we documented on Part page and submitted by the deadline.
Silver
1. Validated Part / Validated Contribution
We proved that the function of each constructed basic parts have function.                                          We also tested the total solution to prove that our design will have higher energy efficiency as well as the ability of carbon utilization.                                          The fuction of pH alert system has also been measured and confirmed .
2. Collaboration
The project of USETC-China is to degrade straw into four bio-products, one is xylose,                                          which is an important source of our E. coli carbon utilization.                                          Therefore, we collaborate to each other to build the complete system of straw degration and carbon utilization.                                                                           Besides, Tec-Monterrey construct a pollutant sensing system of sea which is related to our pH sensor construction,                                          so we share our idea to fulfill the sensing system of sea water condition.
3. Human Practices
To make sure our project fit into human-being life,                                          we stepped out the laboratory and propagated our project to share our idea of utilization of carbon dioxide.                                          Details can be found on our human practice About page
Gold
1. Integrated Human Practices
We met with several experts both in academia and industry.                                          They gave us valuable advice that affected project.                                          Details can be found on our Integrated Human Practices page.
2. Improve a Previous Part or Project
Promoter gadA is a pH sensitive promoter that could express at low pH which is around pH6 to pH7.                                          In order to increase the expression of insulated genes, promoter gadA,                                          we added a ribozyme which could self-cleaving,                                          RIboJ as to impact the expression of downstream genes for the Improvement of promoter gadA.
3. Model Your Project
In order to predict the efficiency of E. coli carbon utilization, we successfully build a Model of CO2 metabolism of E. coli and make an analysis to optimize the ability of E. coli carbon utilization.
4. Demonstration of Your Work
To implant our E. coli into the industry, we built a device to put our E. coli.                                         Also, we use database to get data from device and set up an app to receive data.                                          We show the videa in Demonstrate page.
