Enterprise Visit
“Bring our project to life” is always our final goal. Therefore, we visited                                  China Steel Corporation, which is the largest steel maker in Taiwan, to gain the                                 truth opinions from                                 our future potential users. In addition,                                 we also visit the An-nan campus of NCKU to see the progress from research to                                 practice, including the cost calculation, evaluation and benefit analysis, etc.
Visit An-nan Campus of NCKU
We visited a microalgae farm, which provided us with a wealth of knowledge                                         about the considerations needed to design a bioreactor. With the advices given,                                         we modified our bioreactor design for practical application in industry.

As a part of iGEMers, our team wishes to bridge the gap                                                 between laboratories and                                                 industry. In order to obtain more information about CO2 biofixation, we visited microalgae cultivation demonstration plant in                                                 An-Nan Campus of National Cheng-Kung University. The microalgae                                                 cultivation                                                 demonstration is a project managed by Professor Jo-Shu                                                 Chang, an expert in biofixation of CO2 from industry using                                                 marine                                                 algae. We toured their microalgae                                                 cultivation systems, and were impressed by their idea of converting                                                 microalgae into functional                                                 products. This inspired us to synthesis commercial products from                                                 CO2 in                                                 modified E. coli. They also                                                 provided us with a wealth of knowledge about the considerations needed                                                 to                                                 design a bioreactor for                                                 utilization of CO2 and evaluated cost effectiveness of our                                                 project.                                                 CO2 concentration in flue gas                                                 can be as high as 20~30%, thus it is necessary for us to lower the                                                 CO2 concentration level before                                                 entering bioreactor to increase carbon fixation efficiency. With the                                                 advices given, we modified our                                                 bioreactor design for practical application in industry.
Visit China Steel Corporation
China Steel Corporation, the largest integrated steel maker in Taiwan. They concerned the application of our system and gave us many advices. After the interview, we  revised                                         our pro designs to more satisfy their need.

China Steel Corporation (CSC), located at Kaohsiung,                                                 Taiwan, was founded in December 1971. With annual production (in terms of crude steel) around                                                 10                                                 million tons, CSC                                                 produces a range of products including plates, bars, wire rods, hot and                                                 cold rolled coils,                                                 electrogalvanized coils, electrical steel coils, hot-dip galvanized                                                 coils,                                                 and Ti/Ni-base alloy.                                                 The domestic market takes roughly 69% of CSC’s production and the                                                 exports                                                 take the remaining 31%.                                                 CSC is the largest steel company in Taiwan, enjoying more than 50% of                                                 the                                                 domestic market. Major                                                 export destinations are Mainland China (including HongKong), Japan and                                                 Southeast Asia.[1]
After participating at the Asia-Pacific conference,                                                 we                                                 organized some questions                                                 and made a report to CSC. We consider the implementation of                                                 industrial and have a presentation                                                 to CSC. We also got some feedback from them. Their concern is                                                 that                                                 the smoke emitted by the factory is not completely carbon dioxide, but will contain some                                                 impurities like SOx and NOx. So                                                 they asked more about whether E. coli can survive and react in                                                 this                                                 environment. In addition, they                                                 also praised our idea of removing carbon and solving the disadvantages                                                 of                                                 microalgae space. They                                                 even said that they are very supportive of young people’ s ideas and                                                 there                                                 are opportunities for                                                 cooperation in the future.
After the interview, we thought more about the growth environment that E. coli can tolerate, including                                                 excess CO2 concentration , SOx, NOx and even metal                                                 particles.                                                 Therefore, we hope to                                                 design a system that processes metal particles and cooling gas                                                 beforehand                                                 in the factory, and                                                 recycle the used waste medium.

Professor
In order to complete our project, there are lots of theoretical knowledges we have                                 to understand first. Apart from devoting ourselves to researching a large number of                                 papers, the most direct and fastest way is to go to visit professors in related                                 fields of expertise. In addition, each of professor has                                 their specialty respectively. Accepting opinions from different professional                                 field makes our project more comprehensive.

Prof. Ng is the mother of NCKU-iGEM team. Since the                                                 establishment of NCKU-iGEM in 2016, Prof. Ng has brought synthetic biology as well as iGEM to the spotlight  of NCKU campus. Prof. Ng                                                 always inspires team members by asking us some critical questions                                                 without telling us the answer directly. She gave us advice from                                                 different aspects. She initially gave us many critical suggestions                                                 during the brainstorming. Except for teaching us knowledges about                                                 synthetic biology, she always reminds us to think more about the                                                 real application of our project.
Various useful advice was given by her. She emphasized                                                 the                                                 advantage of protein production by E. coli, she also suggested                                                 us                                                 to study more on high cell density fermentation. Without her timely                                                 advice, our team cannot improve our project.

Our PI, Prof. Huang is an associate professor                                                 of                                                 the institute of Basic Medical Sciences in National Cheng Kung                                                 University. His major field is Bacteriology, Bacteria Genetics, and                                                 Molecular Biology.
We invited Prof. Huang to attend our first presentation.                                                 During our first                                                 presentation, he provided us a lot of useful feedback and we could feel                                                 the intention of Prof. Huang. So, our team thought that Prof. Huang could                                                 guide us for all our project and we wanted to invite him as our PI.                                                 Luckily, we have succeeded!
Since the day Prof. Huang joined us, he                                                 provided us all the resources that we needed or could make it more                                                 convenient. Secondly, he gave us many ideas when we had met                                                 difficulties or junctions in our progress whether it was dry lab or wet                                                 lab. We really appreciated what he has told and taught us.
Meetup with Prof. Hashimoto
Prof. Hashimoto is a project assistant professor from Institute of                                         Molecular Medicine. After the discussion with him, we found out the feasibility                                         of expressing CA in E. coli. Therefore, we decided to clone the CA gene                                         into                                         the E .coli.

Our secondary PI, Prof. Hashimoto Masayuki is a                                                 project assistant professor from Institute of Molecular Medicine.
The host organism in our project is E. coli.                                                 Prof.                                                 Hashimoto is                                                 familiar with the genetic manipulation of E. coli, therefore we                                                 introduced our idea to him. One of his research is about the effect of                                                 carbonic anhydrase (CA) to the growth of E. coli. Since we                                                 wanted to                                                 introduce heterologous CA into the E. coli, he suggested us to                                                 consider                                                 whether it will compete with the native CA of E. coli, which                                                 might                                                 affect the function of the heterologous CA. Also, Professor Hashimoto                                                 introduced the concept of homologous recombination to us as we had the                                                 idea to insert our construction into E. coli chromosome.                                                 However, we                                                 were suggested not to do the homologous recombination due to the                                                 limited time we had.
After the discussion, we started to review journals                                                 and found out the                                                 feasibility of expressing both native and non-native CA in E. coli.                                                 We                                                 found out that there were research which expressed heterologous CA                                                 successfully. Therefore we decided to clone the CA gene into the E                                                 .coli.

This year, our project is related to carbon                                                 sequestration. Therefore, we grab the chance to discuss our idea with                                                 Prof. Bieng-Zih Hsieh. Prof. Hsieh is an associate                                                 professor in the Department of Resources Engineering. One of his                                                 research topics is about CO2 sequestration, which is a topic                                                 that                                                 related to our project, the difference is that he employs a physical method                                                 in this aspect, while we use a biological method.
At first, we defined our project as carbon capture.                                                 However, he                                                 introduced the idea of carbon utilization to us as he thought it is                                                 more suitable for our project. Prof. Hsieh introduced some carbon                                                 capture or utilization strategies that implemented in the industry                                                 currently and suggested us to do more research on those methods. He                                                 also reminded us to compare our system with other biological approach to                                                 figure out our strength and weakness.

Prof. Chao-Chung Peng is an assistant professor in                                                 Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and International Bachelor                                                 Degree Program on Energy. He used to work in China steel corporation (CSC) so he                                                 gave us a chance to contact CSC.
We met up with prof. Chung to get some suggestions                                                 which more helpful for                                                 our direction of our projects. Prof. Chung is proficient in energy                                                 field, different from giving us experimental technical advice, and he gave                                                 us more about suggestion for action on device and ideas.
He thought that when we look for our advantages, we can                                                 take apart each of our research processes and experimental steps, and find every                                                 possible point that is less efficient. The benefit of the whole                                                 project is very great. For example, what kind of way we can use to let                                                 every E. coli to eat most CO2, the way we replace our                                                 cultured E. coli.                                                 It is true that there are existing ways we can think more about                                                 how we can improve. He also emphized that we must be very                                                 understandable about our project, it included our advantages,                                                 disadvantages, potential threat, our whole project process, and the                                                 most optimum environment we should provide for our E. coli. The                                                 more we                                                 realized our project, we could find more possibility of development.                                                 After                                                 talking with professor, we inspired more ideas and found direction                                                 about our project more clearly.
He gave us some advice in engineering viewpoint.                                                 Therefore, we tried                                                 to rewirte a big scope of our project and defined the points that we                                                 have to fulfill.

We had an opportunity to speak with Prof.                                                  Chieh-Chen Huang from National Chung Hsing University (NCHU) in the Asia                                                 Pacific Conference, whose work includes the reverse TCA cycle of                                                 engineered carbon capturing E. coli. Upon our discussion, Prof.                                                 Huang                                                 raised the issue of the low efficiency of one of our enzymes, Rubisco                                                 and suggested that we cultured our engineered E. coli in an                                                 anaerobic                                                 condition. Since Rubisco, the ribulose-1,5-biphosphate                                                 carboxylase/oxygenase is an enzyme catalyzing the reaction of either                                                 carbon dioxide or oxygen with ribulose-1,5-biphosphate (RuBP) as the                                                 name itself suggests, putting our system in an aerobic condition would                                                 significantly lower the efficiency of capturing carbon dioxide due to                                                 the similarities between gaseous carbon dioxide and oxygen.

We discuss with the senior, Hai-Xuan Chen. He is the PhD student from the lab of Prof. Liang-Ming Huang in the department of Environmental Engineering. His research is about biological modeling.
We chose Multi-fuel pure oxygen combustion reduction and Advanced                                                 carbon capture combustion technology which have closely related to our                                                 project. Interestingly, we found that in such business matchmaking                                                 conference involved in many vendors, most of them focused more on what                                                 benefit they create rather than the detailed technology process.
Our discussion is about biological modeling. At first, we have to collect the experiment data, so that we can build the model from our experiment. After that, we improve our parameter of model to make our modeling more accurate. In this way, we can operate our model before we start doing our experiment.
After discussion, we have to consider more possible pathways from xylose to pyruvate. Therefore, there is another pathway we have to figure out and build the model to check which pathway our e.coli will go. On the other hand, we can know pyruvate where it comes from by node analysis, and we can realize pyruvate from xylose or carbon dioxide uptake afterwards.
Most important of all, it will produce carbon dioxide in glycolysis. Hence, we have to consider the carbon dioxide we produce, and then compare the carbon dioxide we fix. In this discussion, we find out several ways to improve our project including more pathway we consider and node analysis we can calculate.

Prof. Jo-Shu Chang has a lot of specialties of                                                 Biochemical Engineering, Microalgae Biotechnology, CO2 reutilization, Cecycling economy, Biomass Energy, Environmental Biotechnology, Applied                                                 Microbiology. He completes a microalge carbon utilization system in An-nan                                                 Campus of NCKU which helped the largest energy company in Taiwan (CPC,                                                 Taiwan) and the largest steel maker in Taiwan (CSC) to                                                 develop the research platform of microalgae-based flue gas CO2 biofixation technology. Besides, Since 2009, Prof. Chang served as the                                                 PI                                                 of National Energy Program (NEP) projects and focused on                                                 microalgae-based CO2 capture and utilization for biofuels                                                 production                                                 and biorefinery.
Our project is to reuse the CO2 emitted                                            in the industry                                                 with a biological way. Although the pathway of carbon flow in E.                                                     coli and in microalge are quite different, it is really important for us to                                                 understand the current method of biological carbon utilization before                                                 we begin our research. We want to deeply understand the whole                                                 microalgae culture pool system including the position of CO2 pipeline,                                                 downstream process, pool cleaning and how is the progress of a                                                 research in lab turning into real application.What's more, we                                                 He subsequently proposed a 'zero emission' biohydrogen system                                                 integrating unit operation of cellulose hydrolysis,                                                 darkfermentation, photofermentation,                                                 microalgae CO2 fixation, microbial fuel cell and                                                 hydrogen fuel cell.
Prof. Chang lets us visit how his project work in An-nan                                                 campus.                                                 Prof. Chang's team has been working with CSC and CPC,                                                 Taiwan to develop innovative microalgae-based flue gas CO2 reduction                                                 and biofuels production technologies. Therefore, they shared the                                                 progress of the whole technologies coming out. From the beginning,                                                 Prof. Chang was focusing on the conversion of biomass feedstock and waste                                                 materials to energy.                                                 Large scale microalgae cultivation                                                 plants were constructed in CSC and                                                 on An-Nan campus of NCKU.
We visited Prof. Chang to discuss about our                                                 carbon capture                                                 system. We had a great time discussing and he gave us three pieces of advice. One                                                 is                                                 to define the velocity of CO2 input in which scale of CO2 we want to                                                 solve with. Another one is to confirm a commercial product like                                                 proteins which can bring us some income to balance the cost. The last                                                 one is to calculate the whole carbon balance from the source of xylose                                                 to the process of waste. We were really appreciated that we can have a                                                 short meeting with prof. Chang.

Veerabhadran Ramanathan is a Distinguished Professor in Scripps                                                 Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, and UNESCO Professor of                                                 Climate and Policy at TERI University, New Delhi, India. Prof. Ramanathan                                                 discovered the greenhouse effect of halocarbons, particularly, CFCs in                                                 1975.
He has won many prestigious awards, such as the Volvo                                                 Prize, the Rossby Prize and the Tyler Prize, the highest rated                                                 environmental award given in the United States. In 2013 he was awarded                                                 the United Nations Top Environmental Prize.
He was invited to share his thought about climate                                                 change in NCKU as the 2018 Tang Laureate for sustainability science. Using the topic ‘Bending the Curve’, he would like to raise the public                                                 awareness on climate change issue. His speech inspired us a lot. He not                                                 only introduced the ideas of super pollutants such as HFCs, CH4 and                                                 black carbon, but also proposed the solutions for tackling climate                                                 change.
After his speech, we briefly introduced our project to                                                 him. Although his work focuses on the impact of non-CO2 gases on climate change, he thinks that human beings need more                                                 alternatives to tackle carbon dioxide emission problem, and our project                                                 may be one of the solutions, which makes us have faith in our project.                                                 He was glad to know that undergraduates have worked hard to deal with                                                 this issue.
Through this meetup, we realized that ‘everyone is                                                 responsible to make the world better, no one should be excluded.’ Unity                                                 of the entire society is the most effective way to mitigate climate                                                 change. Therefore, we put more effort in our human practice activities                                                 by engaging with government entities, local enterprise, institution and                                                 the public.
Conversation with Dr. Shen
Dr. Shen,manager of Industrial Technology Research Institute, pointed out that gaseous emitted from heavy industry contains a lot of toxic                                         elements, which is not suitable to be recycled into food products. We take this                                         consideration into our project.

We were lucky enough to arrange a meeting with Dr. Cheng-Hsien Shen,                                                 manager in the ‘New Energy                                                 Technology Division’, who is currently working on Carbon Capture & Storage Application Project at                                                 Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). ITRI is a                                                 national-level, non-profit organization                                                 for applied research which accelerates industrial technology                                                 development in Taiwan. He introduced                                                 us to current carbon capture methods and technologies in Taiwan. Storing                                                 carbon dioxide underground                                                 into deep geological formations is believed to the best way to return                                                 carbon dioxide to the Earth.                                                 However, considering the active fault lines across Taiwan and the frequent                                                 occurrence of earthquakes,                                                 it may be risky to have largescale CCS project here. He was amazed by                                                 our project, as we developed                                                 a biological solution of capturing CO2 emission in industry. The                                                 highlight of this method is                                                 engineered E.coli could efficiently capture and utilize CO2 into                                                 products with great market                                                 potential. Shen pointed out that gaseous emitted from heavy industry                                                 contains a lot of toxic                                                 elements, which is not suitable to be recycled into esculent products. We                                                 take this consideration into                                                 our project.
Meet up
“A Joy Shared Is a Joy Tripled”  When we met up with other iGEMers to share our                                 projects and the difficulties, we encountered with each other, enjoyed the process                                 and often caused resonance. What's more, we could inspire more ideas and find the                                 possibility of cooperation.
Meetup with OT-2 principal, Kristin
We meet-up with OT-2 principal, Kristin. We asked her some problem about OT-2,                                         and briefly introduced our project to get some feedback from her.

During the meetup, we asked her some problems about                                                 our                                                 robot that we have met in                                                 this morning and she answered us that there were still some components                                                 being                                                 shipped so hopefully we                                                 could wait until those components to arrive. For the software problems,                                                 she                                                 built a forum for all                                                 the iGEM teams which got the robot so that we could discuss online or                                                 sharing all kinds of protocol                                                 with each other.
We also briefly introduced our project but since we                                                 didn't                                                 have too much time so she                                                 could only                                                 suggest us to study more related topic of iGEM. She is willing to                                                 have                                                 next video meeting with us                                                 and expertly we could show her our device next time. We were so glad to                                                 have this talk that day.

We have a video meeting with Tec-Monterrey. After introducing our project to                                         them, they remind us to think about our end product which can make our project                                         more complete.

We had a video meeting with Tec-Monterrey. After                                                 introducing our project to them,                                                 they had pointed out some aspects that we need to think more about.                                                 They                                                 reminded us to think about                                                 our end product which can make our project more complete.
During the meeting, we came up out with the ideas to                                                 collaborate with each other.                                                 Their project has two                                                 parts. The main part is E-coding, which uses bacteria to record the                                                 data.                                                 Another part is to sense                                                 the pollutant in river of Mexico, which is the part that we could link                                                 our                                                 work. We had constructed                                                 a pH alert system for low pH sensing, they suggested us to incorporate                                                 our pH                                                 sensing construct in                                                 their pollutant sensing system, making it become more complete.
Meetup with Tec Chihuahua
We have a nice talk with Tec Chihuahua. During our talk, we receive many                                         advices especially for our constructions and cost of our main device. We also                                         give our suggestion such as constructing a control system on their project.

We had a nice talk with members from Tec Chihuahua.                                                 First, we introduced our                                                 project to each other.
During our talk, we received many useful                                                 recommendations                                                 and advice especially for                                                 our                                                 constructions and cost of our main device. The considering these                                                 aspects                                                 which also led us to                                                 more focus on the value of our project to be applied on the industries                                                 sides. Eventually, as we were                                                 communicating for our main ideas and project, we found that Tec                                                 Chihuahua                                                 seems to have a great                                                 idea on solving the problem of larvae-killing bacteria. According to                                                 researchers, the extinction                                                 of bee will also lead the human society to face the acute problem which                                                 is                                                 the shortage of food                                                 sources. By considering this knotty dilemma, team Tec Chihuahua has                                                 outcome this with the                                                 technologies of synthetic biology. In addition, we also give our                                                 suggestion                                                 such as constructing a                                                 control system on their project so that there will be an awareness on                                                 the                                                 shortage of material or                                                 overusing of their materials.

On July 17, we had meetup with National Chung Cheng                                             University. We hoped we can                                             know more about each other's project deeply and give some suggestion to                                             benefit each other's                                             project.
In the beginning, we greeted and introduced ourselves                                             to                                             each other. Next, we                                             entered our project presentation time. In this meetup, we had more                                             familiar                                             with each other's                                             project. We gave our                                             questions and suggestions to CCU, and we also received great feedback                                             from                                             them. We discussed our                                             construction in wet, design modeling in dry and activities                                             communication in                                             human practice. We also                                             shared future plan with each others to think about that there is a                                             possibility of cooperation.
After finished our conversation in presentation, we                                             toured                                             them in NCKU and had                                             lunch with them. In                                             this less formal time, we could communicate more relaxing with each                                             other                                             and share our project in                                             a more pleasant way.

During July 30 to August 3, our team attended the Asia                                             Pacific Conference which is                                             held by National Chung Hsing University, locates in Taichung city. Asia                                             Pacific Conference is a platform that could let all of the iGEM teams in asia to communicate                                             with                                             others, receive feedback                                             from others and generate new ideas. These can make iGEMers have a                                             opportunity to expand their                                             horizons instead of always cringing in your own corner and doing your                                             own                                             things. During the                                             conference, several challenge has been occurred, including the cost of                                             our                                             material. While, after                                             several time of discussion and interchange, we found that this is one                                             of                                             our critical problem. We                                             very appreciated for the suggestion of all the participants of Asia                                             Pacific Conference.
In these 4 days, we exhibited our project for all the                                             iGEMers to interchange our ideas and take                                             suggestions from others. We also found that other teams possess unique                                             projects that may advance                                             our new ear of technologies. We really appreciated for what we have                                             learn in                                             these 4 days and we                                             hoped to see them in the Giant Jamboree!
Meet up with UESTC
We designed a complete flow chart of E. coli carbon utilization system in                                     factory UESTC-China igem team who aimed to degrade straw by a sythetic biology way                                     and then converted it into bio-fuel such as hydrogen and butanol.

Meet up with UESTC

When designing the whole CO2 utilization system, we met some                                             problem during cost evaluation and carbon footprint. We were lucky to find                                             our friend, UESTC-China, to work together and end up building a completely                                             eco-friendly system with negative carbon footprint.
We were delighted when we found out someone who will be                                             able to resolve our problems. UESTC-China, an iGEM team that focused on                                             degrading straw into useful raw materials, which are glucose, xylose,                                             ferule acid, and lignin. In addition, they aimed to convert glucose into                                             butanol and hydrogen. As xylose is the main carbon source for our                                             engineered E. coli, we came up with a collaboration idea by                                             integrating our system at the downstream of their system. Xylose is one of                                             the side product produced during straw degradation, it can be extracted and                                             utilized in our system. Concerning the synthesis of xylose may produce                                             greenhouse gas and chemicals, we would like to obtain xylose produced via                                             biological method.
Straw was a biowaste in agriculture while it wasn't easy                                             to decompose. UESTC-China solved this problem with                                             synthetic biology successfully. Through our collaboration, they can not only produce                                             bioenergy, but have another powerful application in CO2 emission                                             problem. NCKU-Tainan provided them a valuable application way and helped                                             them design a draft of device. The xylose's source from straw was really                                             important to E. coli CO2 utilization system which changed                                             the positive carbon footprint into negative carbon footprint. This                                             collaboration solved both the energy problem and environment problem.
