                                In order to complete our project, there are lots of theoretical knowledges we have
                                to understand first. Apart from devoting ourselves to researching a large number of
                                papers, the most direct and fastest way is to go to visit professors in related
                                fields of expertise. In addition, each of professor has
                                their specialty respectively. Accepting opinions from different professional
                                field makes our project more comprehensive.

                                                introduced our idea to him. One of his research is about the effect of

                                                introduced the concept of homologous recombination to us as we had the

                                                us to current carbon capture methods and technologies in Taiwan. Storing

                                                carbon dioxide to the Earth.
                                                However, considering the active fault lines across Taiwan and the frequent
