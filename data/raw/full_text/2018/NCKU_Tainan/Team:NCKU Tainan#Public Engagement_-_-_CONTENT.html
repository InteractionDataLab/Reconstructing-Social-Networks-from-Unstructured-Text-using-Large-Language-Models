                                                Before 5/21, we have contacted teachers in HWSH. Their teacher
                                                scheduled our program into their
                                                biology classes (08:00-10:00). Three of our members participated in
                                                this program. We shared our
                                                college life and demonstrated how our training from out major
                                                contributed to our project in
                                                the team at first. We then introduced iGEM and the job of four
                                                compartments. We also went through
                                                our the idea and the concept of our project. For the last session of
                                                our program, we introduce some
                                                basic concept of the biological experiment, several important model
                                                organisms in synthetic biology,
                                                and the concept of Gram stain. We also teach them how to handle pipette
                                                precisely. In the final 40
                                                minutes, it’s time for them to apply what they have learned to the
                                                experiment! We prepared the
                                                sealed slides of Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile in our lab.
                                                After connecting the optical
                                                microscope with CCD camara , the live image was projected to the screen
                                                and the whole class could
                                                observed the morphology of the bacteria. Students are totally exciting
                                                when they sucked liquid from
                                                pipette successfully. They also asked us questions about our project
                                                and gave us lots of useful
                                                feedback! After this program, we received a message from a lovely
                                                student, who was burned the

                                                also make us produce more motivation to go forward in igem competition.

                                                and we had one our to launch
                                                our slide and the materials of the experiment. Three of our members
                                                participated in this program.
                                                First, we had twenty minutes for our lecture, which we introduced the
                                                basic concept of the cell
                                                included the structure of the cell and the level of the organism. Than,
                                                the students observed the
                                                different kinds of cells specimen under the microscope. After the
                                                observation, we prepared an
                                                experiment for them. We instructed them the step to extract their own
                                                DNA by some materials in the
                                                common life. After the program, we had ten minutes for review the
                                                lecture and let them write it
                                                down.
