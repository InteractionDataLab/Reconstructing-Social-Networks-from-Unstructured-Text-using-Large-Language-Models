Thermometer DS18B20
Motivation Experiments Wiring Reference
In this section, we are showing how to use DS18B20 one wire water proof                                 thermometer.
Motivation
E. coli is temperature sensitive. According to the                                         experiment, it grows the best in 37°C (99°F), and its acceptable range is about                                         22°C to 40°C (72°F to 104°F). Therefore, we need a thermometer to monitor the medium's temperature to ensure the E. coli works well in the reactor.
Experiments
Experiment 1: Temperature measuring
Purpose
As the buffer solution wouldn’t change too much in the                                                 environment, we used the buffer solution to calibrate the pH meter to                                                 ensure that the deviation would be the same every time.
Method
We put our thermometer into the incubator. We wire the sensor                                                 with the LCD to keep it closed.
Result
We placed the sensor in an environment of incubator 37 degrees celsius, and the                                                 temperature measured by the LCD display sensor was 37.06 degrees celsius. The                                                 error is                                                 0.06 degrees celsius, which we think it's not a big error. But in order to make the                                                 measure                                                 temperature more accurately, we designed Experiment 2 - Temperature                                                 experimental                                                 curve fitting.
Experiment 2: Temperature experimental curve fitting
Purpose
Since the error value of the temperature sensing device is not                                                 necessarily, we use multiple sampling methods, and then average the                                                 values measured in each temperature interval to reduce the error value                                                 without excessive error.
Method
We use the above method to take 150 strokes as training data, and use                                                 the basic accessories of MATLAB to find the appropriate nine                                                 temperature model formulas.
Result
We found a temperature curve of 7th order to reduce its error. (You can                                                 see more                                                 information in software temperature .)
