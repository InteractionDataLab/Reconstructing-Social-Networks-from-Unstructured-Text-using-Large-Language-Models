Introduction Video Sensors
The goal of our project is to solve the problem of carbon dioxide (CO2) by using                                         engineered E. coli to fix CO2 emitted from industries. To                                         achieve our goal, we designed a device that we will upscale our project to be used                                         on fields and aim to integrate the device into industrial IGCC system.
Our device is divided into three main parts: a bioreactor, a medium tank and a                                         collection tank. Carbon dioxide fixation process takes place in bioreactor                                         which contains our engineered E.coli.
In order to maintain the optimal conditions, the bioreactor consists of a pH                                         meter and a thermometer. Besides, a CO2 sensor is mounted at the top                                         of the lid to sense to CO2 concentration of the gas. All of the data                                         will be transmitted to our IoT system so that we could online monitoring                                         conditions of the bioreactor.
Here we are going to show how does our device works in the video below ! We incubated our engineered E. coli in M9 xylose solution and successfully                                         implemented IoT system with our device.
