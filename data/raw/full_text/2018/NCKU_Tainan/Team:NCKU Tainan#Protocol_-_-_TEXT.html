Make sure that ethanol (96 ~ 100 %)                                                                 has been added into Wash Buffer when first use.
Centrifuge at 16,000 xg for an additional                                                             3 minutes to dry the FAPD Column.
Important step! The residual liquid                                                                 should be removed thoroughly on this step.
Place the FAPD Column to a new 1.5 ml                                                             microcentrifuge tube.

Important step! For effective                                                                 elution, make sure that the elution solution is                                                                 dispensed on the membrane center and is absorbed                                                                 completely.
Do not elute the DNA using less than                                                                 suggested volume (50 µl). It will lower the final                                                                 yield.
Centrifuge at 16,000 xg for 3 minute to                                                             elute plasmid DNA and store the DNA at -20 ℃.
