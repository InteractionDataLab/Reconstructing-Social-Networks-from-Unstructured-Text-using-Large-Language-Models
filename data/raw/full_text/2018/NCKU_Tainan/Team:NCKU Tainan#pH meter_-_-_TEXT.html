About this section, we are showing how to use the pH meter in arduino.
Motivation
Because E. coli is sensitive to pH value, and according to the experiment                                         of                                         the pH sensor by WET members. We know that E. coli can’t grow                                         below pH                                         value of                                         6, and                                         generally grow the best at pH 7.
Experiments
Experiment 1: Instrument calibration
Purpose
Because the buffer solution wouldn’t change too much in the                                                 environment, we used the buffer solution to calibrate the pH meter to                                                 ensure that the deviation would be the same every time.
Method
Insert pH meter into buffer solution of pH 7, wait for 1 min, it                                                 will achieve a stable                                                 value.
Minus the value with pH 7, and it will get the offset value. For                                                 instance, 7-7.09=-0.09.
Write the offset value into code, and then upload the code into Arduino                                                 again.
After rinsing the pH meter, we will insert it into pH 4 buffer                                                 solution.
If it is found to be too different from the error of pH 4, you                                                 should adjust the knob.                                                 After inserting pH 4, it is found that the error with pH 4 is very                                                 large.
Adjust the knob. (Remark: Because the change of the knob is small,                                                 it may have to turn a                                                 few more times until display pH 4.)
Finally, it can be found that the measured pH is 4.
Formula calculation
voltage = analog value*5/1024
pH value = 3.5*voltage+offset
Experiment 2: Precision measurement
Purpose
We assume that pH 4 to 7 is linear, so we want to verify                                                 whether it is linear between pH                                                 4 to 7. By measuring the solution of pH 4.7, compare its                                                 deviation.
Method
Mix a solution with pH=4.7 and measure with a calibrated pH                                                 meter.
Result
After inserting the solution with pH=4.7, we found that the                                                 value was stable at pH 4.83                                                 with an error of about 0.13, which roughly met the error of                                                 this pH meter ± 0.1 pH.
