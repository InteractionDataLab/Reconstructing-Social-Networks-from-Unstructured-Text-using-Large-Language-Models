Introduction
Nearly 30% of CO2 emissions are attributable to                                         industries.                                         The goal of our                                         project is to solve the CO2 problem by using engineered E. coli to fix CO2 emitted from                                         industries and convert it into bio-product, pyruvate. To accomplish our goal, we designed a device                                         that will upscale our project to be used on field and we aim to integrate the                                         device into                                         industrial IGCC system. And we used the Arduino to sense the pH , CO2 concentration and temperature then use the Wi-Fi                                             sensor to upload to the database . Last but not least, we can monitor the                                         condition of our device by showing data in our App .

Fig 2.Perspective schematic view of our device
Our device consists of 4 main parts : a bioreactor, a nutrient                                         tank, a collection                                         tank and Arduino sensors. The flue gas from industrial contains high concentration of CO2 which will                                         inhibit the growth                                          of E.coli. Thus, we will decrease CO2 concentration level to less                                          than 5% at the inlet of bioreactor. With a flowmeter, we can measure the flow of gases                                          in                                         pipelines.
Fig 3.Circuit diagram
For Arduino, we use thermometer (DS18B20)、pH meter and                                         CO2 sensor (MG811) to                                         monitor our device. Besides, the LCD will print datum while the Wi-Fi                                         sensor (ESP8266 Nodemcu) will                                         upload our records to database. You can see more information about                                         arduino code in software .
Bioreactor
We developed a closed system on in our bioreactor design and implemented online                                        real time monitoring system                                         which can determine the progress condition of bioreactor.
The gas inlet port is located on the bioreactor’s lower part while                                         outlet port is                                         located on the bioreactor’s upper lid. As low concentration CO2 enters the                                         bioreactor, it flows                                         through the diffuser refiner and dissolves in the buffered medium to form acid.                                         A pH sensor and                                         a thermometer is installed to monitor the bioreactor tank for further                                         control implementation.                                         Besides, the CO2 concentration level of exhaust gas is monitored by                                         a CO2 sensor, which is                                         mounted on the upper lid. These sensor’s output is connected to an Arduino                                         analog input and sensor                                         readings are displayed on a serial LCD which is attached on the lid of                                         bioreactor. The data is then                                         uploaded in real time to a web server via WiFi by using Arduino WiFi Shield.
Stirrer
Fig 4.Perspective schematic view of magnetic stir
To prevent sedimentation of cells at the bottom of bioreactor,                                         we build our own                                         slow speed magnetic stirrer of 3D printed materials which permits gentle mixing of                                         microcarrier cell cultures.                                         The 3D printed magnet bed is designed specifically for two magnets and can be                                         fitted on the DC                                         motor. The stirrer works by using a DC motor to spin two magnets with opposite                                         polarity, which                                         could create a magnetic field in the bioreactor and cause the stir bar to spin                                         and mix the                                         contents. For controlling the speed of the DC motor, we use Arduino and L298N                                         to control the input                                         voltage to the motor by using PWM signal.

Nutrient tank
Besides, we also implemented fed-batch culture system in our                                         design. Nutrients are fed to the bioreactor during cultivation to prevent                                         nutrient depletion. The nutrients are pumped into the growth chamber at a rate                                         proportional to the growth factor of the culture, which is determined                                         experimentally through the doubling time of the particular bacterial strain.
Electromagnetic valve
In order to simulate the situation of the industry, two electromagnetic valves are installed on the input and output of the collection tank and the medium tank, they can be controlled by the App.
