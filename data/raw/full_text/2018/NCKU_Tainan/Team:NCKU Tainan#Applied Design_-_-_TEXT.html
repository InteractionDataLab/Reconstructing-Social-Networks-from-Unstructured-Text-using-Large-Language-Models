Overview
In this project, we, the NCKU Tainan Team, have proposed an                                         alternative way to reduce the emission of Carbon dioxide (CO2).                                         Referring to the opinions and feedbacks from many industry experts and                                         professors, we design a new factory flow to capture CO2 by E.                                             coli Not only our device meets the specs to commercialize, but it also                                         demonstrates high cost performance.
The emission of CO2 has been a serious problem for a                                         century that causes global warming and severe climate change. Even though many                                         ways have been tried to reduce it, the generation of CO2 primarily                                         from industry is still overwhelming. Therefore, scientists and governments have                                         been working hard to find solutions to tackle the problem.
Control System
Fig 2. Overview of the control system
There are many aspects we need to consider. First, we calculate                                         the emission velocity of CO2 from the factory, as well as the medium                                         exchange rate and the growth rate of E. coli.
Fig 1. is a process of whole E. coli carbon utilization that we design                                         for industrial application. We simplify it into three parts which shows in Fig                                         2. to explain more clearly. Three switches control three parts, named A, B and                                         C. Basically, the factory replaces the medium twice a day. At one hour before                                         replacing the medium, the user needs to turn on switch C to discharge ninety                                         percent of the medium. When it is time to replace the medium, switch C will be                                         turned off and switch B will be turned on to refill medium. When sufficient                                         medium is added, switch B will be turned off and switch A will be turned on to                                         let CO2 in. Just like the animation showed on Fig 1..
Considering the cost, the growth time of our E. coli and                                         the floor area, we optimized replace time of the medium, replace it every                                         twelve hours and with 72 parallel bioreactors. Next, we are going to have more detail description on three parts, which are Gas preparation system and flow                                             system , Medium preparation ,                                         and Downstream products purification and                                             biosafety .
A. Gas preparation system and flow                                         system
Fig 3. Diagram of gas preparation system and flow system
According to IGCC (Integrate Gasification Combined Cycle) flow                                         diagram, the fuel is first converted to syngas which is a mixture of H2 and CO. The syngas is then burned in a combined cycle consisting of a gas                                         turbine and a steam turbine with a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). After                                         CO2 / H2 separation, IGCC can reach the demand of CO2 purity including low SOx and NOx emission fraction of allowable limits of                                         bacteria. Finally, the produced flue gas could enter the pipeline leading to the bioreactor.
In E. coli utilization system, the air is pumped in to neutralize the                                         concentration of CO2. A controlled valve is used to control flow                                         rate and split distribution. When the switch a is turned on, the switch b will                                         be turned off, and vice versa. As for the CO2 inlet and outlet, it                                         will maintain an open system of bioreactor. In other words, CO2 will                                         enter continuously and cause some non-reacted CO2 emitted.

Syngas has been treated by sulfur and nitrogen removal, as well as heavy metal                                         removal and cooling tank. Through IGCC process, purified CO2 in flue                                         gas is allowable for E. coli CO2 utilizing.
B. Medium preparation
Fig 5. Diagram of medium preparation
At this stage, we have two sections to consider, medium storage                                         and medium preparation before replacing time.
The medium is composed of M9 salt and xylose. For storage, we will convert it                                         into powder with the required proportion. At one hour before replacing time,                                         pour the powder into the medium tank and turn on the water injection switch.                                         Turn on the stirrer of medium tank to have medium powder and water perfect                                         mixing. The outlet of bioreactor (switch c) will be turned on at the same time,                                         letting ninety percent of the medium in the bioreactor flow out . When the                                         medium have prepared well, turn on the switch a and switch b for replacing                                         medium in bioreactor, while the switch c will be turned off.
We also consider the process of raw materials, especially                                         xylose, which is the key source of our pathway. Since xylose is one of the                                         products of agricultural waste degradation, we visited the 2018                                             Tainan Biotechnology and Green Energy Expo to consulted with                                         researchers from National Energy Program-Phase II, whose projects was biofuel                                         and biodegradable plastic production via agricultural waste. They had developed                                         technique that degrade cellulose and semi-cellulose by ion solution.
Besides, we have opportunity to collaborate with UESTC-Chian                                             team . They work for degrading straw with synthetic biology and convert                                         the product into bio-fuel. One of the product from straw degradation is xylose.                                         These techniques are eco-friendly and low-energy-require. Therefore, the                                         process development of xylose production will be a low-carbon-emission process.
C. Downstream products purification and                                         biosafety
Fig 6. Diagram of downstream process
We will discharge 90% of the used medium in the bioreactor one                                         hour before new medium flows in. Which means that we let 10% of the culture                                         remain in the bioreactor as seed culture. The effluent medium will be                                         sterilized and filtered in the downstream clean-up tank. At this step, we                                         harvest the bacteria and extracting the by-product such as amino acids,                                         proteins, medicine or bio-fuel. Different extracting process designed depends                                         on different by-product.
Besides, we try to reuse the waste heat of factories for                                         sterilizing. The waste water can be recycled as well through removing toxins                                         and adjusting pH value the effluent could return to the medium tank. As for                                         energy require for this system, renewable energy helps us to reach near -zero                                         carbon emission process.
Furthermore, we would like to set up membrane bioreactor (MBR)                                         system, which use a hollow filter membrane that is able to filter most of                                         bacteria in the sewage sludge. We use the system to concentrate the used medium                                         before extracting by-product. And the water went through the system is able to                                         recycle back to the medium tank.

Meeting with experts and stakeholders is important in shaping our                                     project to fulfill the needs of our target user.                                     China Steel Corporation is the largest integrated steel Manufacturer in Taiwan.                                     Also, they had been adopting the algal bio-sequestration by                                     cooperating with the research group at our university.
Process
We were given the opportunity to meet with the senior executive of                                     China Steel Corporation                                     to gain invaluable insight for our research. The meeting commenced with our                                     presentation.                                     During the presentation, we introduced our project, including the bioreactor design                                     and the industrial model.                                     By listing out all the aspects we had considered, we would like to obtain advice                                     on the practical and social considerations involved in the application of our                                     project in industry.
Suggestion and Question
Will the high concentration of CO2 retard growth of                                     engineered bacteria?
Microalgae is reported resistant to SOx and NOx. Does E. coli survive under such conditions?
The two questions above were the main concern of CSC. Basically,the                                     best condition for engineered E. coli to capture CO2 is a lower                                     CO2 concentration without too much SOx and NOx particles.                                     However, we won’t be able to provide an ideal culture condition in Industrial                                     application.                                     After testing the tolerance of E. coli, we conclude that E. coli is                                     possible to survive under that                                     kind of condition in factory and the only effects its expression.                                     It may not capture as much CO2 as culture in the lab.
It is important to define a specific commercial product that can be                                     truly produced                                     since your user may consider its economic viability.                                     They stated that a product that can be widely used is better.                                     At the same time, we should consider current GMO legislation if we want to                                     commercialize those products.                                     The actual condition is not as ideal as in the laboratory, we should optimize the condition to maximize the carbon fixation ability of the                                     microbes.

Business Model
The business model describes how an organization creates,                                     delivers, and captures value in an economic, social, cultural, or other                                     environment.                                     Therefore, we introduce this business model as the basis for assessing the                                     integrity and                                     effectiveness of our ideas to work with our industry and even national research.                                     First, we ask questions about this, and beyond the solution,                                     we also explain why we chose this question. Second, we analyzed future                                     developments,                                     including the advantages of using this approach.                                     Next, we introduce our plan to many relevant departments and discuss with the                                     national research.                                     I hope that this plan can be used to promote this plan in the future.
Target issue
More and more people are now paying attention to the impact of CO2.                                     The trend of environmental degradation is gradually increasing.                                     Scientist and national worldwide contribute to capture those excessive CO2.                                     However, how to reduce carbon and use it has become a major problem today.                                     Challenges against carbon process are complicate. Except the technique and                                     implement problem,                                     social acceptability and policy are other key factors about carbon process                                     technology.
In general, planting is a method of carbon process,                                     and the current use of green algae as a method of carbon utilization.                                     This year, we hope to combine synthetic biology with the most advanced                                     technologies.                                     We want to draw people's attention to the environment and reuse these                                     environmentally                                     stimulating projects.

Cost Evaluation
The cost evaluation is always crucial for product being on the                                     market.                                     To compare our engineered E. coli to microalgae,                                     we calculate how much the cost it would be when capturing 1 ton of CO2.

For capturing 1kg of CO2 in one hour, 51000 L is required with                                         engineered E. coli carbon utilization. It seems that the difference                                         volume required for utilizing same amount of CO2 is disadvantage of E. coli carbon utilization system. At this situation, we have to look                                         into the design of the different bioreactor. For microalgae culture, it                                         requires a large surface area to increase light intensity. As usual, the height                                         of the microalgae culture pond cannot exceed 0.5 m. In other words, we have to                                         build a 7 m diameter culture pond with the volume of 19000L. In constrast,                                         engineered E. coli is not limited by light. The bioreactor of E. coli can be built with any height in the indoor or outdoor. To scale up the                                         bioreactor, a 5.8 m diameted with 1.9 m height equals to 51000 L which has                                         lower floor area required.
As a result,the bioreactor of engineered E. coli can                                         save more than 30% floor area compared with micoralgae culture pond. Take the                                         floor area of Taiwan as an example, we can build 94 billions of microalgae                                         culture pond to uilize 10% of annual emission with 12 operation hours. However,                                         1 over 3 of floor area will be save if we replace them with E. coli bioreactor. E. coli bioreactor is more flexible on spacing using, and is                                         less sensitive to weather effect.
Cost
The most expensive source in the medium of our engineered E. coli is xylose.                                     1 mole of xylose will capture 0.17 mole of CO2.                                     Therefore, we need 20.0535 kg of xylose while 1 kg of xylose costs 2 USD.                                     The total cost for our engineered E. coli requires 40.107 USD for capture 1                                     ton of CO2.                                     In contrast, microalgae needs 1000 liter to capture 250 g of CO2,                                     so it needs 4000 liter (about 4 tons) water while 1 ton costs 9.78 USD.                                     The total cost for microalgae is 39.13 USD.

We take two major industrial in Taiwan for example, which are                                         China Steel Corporation (CSC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company                                         (TSMC). We had done some research on annual emission and calculated with our CO2 utilization efficiency. We also set the average carbon emission of small and                                         medium enterprise (SME) as a standard goal which was easier to reach.                                         Therefore, we can model the scale of E. coli carbon utilization system                                         working for 1 % CO2 emission of different enterprise.

Future Work
For industrial application design, we focus on manufacturing                                         valuable products using pyruvate and                                         the linkage between our engineered E. coli between factory.                                         We have designed a device containing our recombinant E. coli,                                         constructed a system which links with factory.                                         However, we still look forward to more modifications of our biological pathway                                         and system.
The most important intermediate product, pyruvate,                                         is also possible to be converted to other compounds by E. coli native                                         enzymes or constructed enzymes                                         which is clone into E. coli from other organism.                                         For future work of pyruvate, we expect that it is predicable to produce amino                                         acid, fatty acid,                                         biofuel and even biodegradable plastic. Pyruvate is crucial for central                                         metabolism pathway,                                         the TCA cycle, of most organism and has the potential to become vary                                         biochemistry compounds.
We set our first future goal at producing glutamine,                                         an essential amino acid for human and some animals. We can simply purify it as                                         a nutrient supply.                                         Not only for medical and daily usage for people, but also for animal husbandry.                                         Furthermore, glutamine can easily convert to other amino acid, and potentially                                         produce other proteins.

Furthermore, researchers have successfully constructed pathways                                         produced cellulose and                                         Poly 3-Hydroxybutyrate-co-3-Hydroxyvalerate through the TCA cycle.                                         We are confident of manufacturing more valuable and diverse products from                                         pyruvate.
WAs for the device we designed, we expect that it is possible                                         to modify our device for power                                         generator and other industry. Our device can utilize CO2 and convert                                         it into various valuable products.                                         With our system, companies can not only reduce CO2 emission but also                                         make profits.
