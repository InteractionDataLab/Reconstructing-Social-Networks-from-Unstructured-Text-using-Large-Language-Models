                                        We initially decided to test its function by HPLC to measure the amount of RuBP
                                        inside the cell. Our instructors pointed out some difficulties in HPLC
                                        measurement such as excessive noise signal in our sample. We, therefore,
                                        determined to test its function with a toxicity test. The product of PRK, RuBP,
                                        cannot be metabolized by wild-type <I>E. coli</I>. The accumulation of RuBP
                                        depletes
                                        the sugar from the native pentose phosphate pathway. Lack of carbon source, the
                                        growth of that strain may be repressed. We incubate the PRK expressing strain
                                        and control stain that contains no plasmid in M9 medium and altered M9 medium
                                        with 4 (g/l) xylose as its sole carbon source. In normal M9 medium, glucose will
                                        not be converted into RuBP. In altered M9 medium, xylose will go through the
                                        native pathway and be converted into RuBP. Growth arrest of PRK strain should
                                        be observed.

                                        We tested PRK in different strains. We first cloned <I>prk</I> into pSB1C3 and
                                        transformed into BL21 (DE3). After 12 hours, the strain without plasmid could
                                        grow up to 1.4 O.D.600 in altered M9 xylose medium. The strain that contains
                                        PRK can grow up to 0.75 O.D.600 in normal M9 medium either. In contrast, the
                                        PRK strain that grew in altered M9 xylose medium showed no growth at all. The
                                        result shows that PRK can suppress/inhibit the growth, which matches to our

                                        Although the function of PRK has been confirmed, we would like to lower the
                                        expression of it to minimize the growth arrest. We thus cloned the part into
                                        pSB3K3, a low copy number plasmid to lower its protein expression. We then

                                        the growth under high and low copy number plasmid. We found out that pSB3K3
                                        shows a
                                        little growth arrest comparing to the strain without plasmid. The growth of it
                                        exceeds that of PRK expressed in pSB1C3. We can regulate the expression of PRK

                                        high or low copy number plasmid to optimize the growth and carbon fixation

                                        We also transformed pSB3K3-<I>prk</I> into W3110 strain. W3110 is reported to have
                                        higher pressure tolerance. The trend of the results is similar to that of the
                                        BL21 (DE3), but the difference between experiement and control group is not obvious                            . We deduce that PRK can still function in W3110 since the
                                        trend matches our expectation. As pSB3K3 is a low copy number plasmid, the
                                        expression of the protein may be lower than that of high copy number plasmid.

                                        came into play: CA enzyme. We cloned Rubisco (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2762011" style="color:#28ff28;">BBa_K2762011</A>) into pSB1C3 and

                                        to report the abnormal acidity of the medium. We thus determine to measure the
                                        fluorescence intensity in a short period of time. We first incubated the
                                        bacteria to log phase (within 2 hour) with LB medium. We then centrifuged the

                                        modified with 1M HCl). We then took the sample and incubate in the 96 well and
                                        measure its fluorescence intensity for every 3 minutes. We found out that the
                                        promoter P<SUB>asr</SUB> will be induced at the pH value below four within 30 minutes. The
                                        different fluorescence intensity can be observed within 30 minutes. The
                                        fluorescence had the peak at pH value of 4.25.
