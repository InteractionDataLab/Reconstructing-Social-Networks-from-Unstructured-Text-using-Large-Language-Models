Construction and functional test
PRK (PHOSPHORIBULOKINASE)
Achievements:
Construction and digestion of DNA gel shows that the size of it was                                             right
The SDS-PAGE of PRK showed that the expression of PRK in the expected                                             protein size
PRK toxicity test proves that the function of it varies when cloned                                             into                                             different plasmids
We constructed prk fragments ( BBa_K2762007 ) from IDT DNA synthesis. After PCR                                         amplification, prk is then cloned into pSB1C3 and transformed into DH5 alpha. SDS-PAGE ensured that                                         the protein expression was as expected. The results are shown below:
Fig 1. Confirmation of prk digestion. Fig 2. Confirmation of PRK expression in DH5 alpha. The expected protein size is                                         37.7kDa.
We initially decided to test its function by HPLC to measure the amount of RuBP                                         inside the cell. Our instructors pointed out some difficulties in HPLC                                         measurement such as excessive noise signal in our sample. We, therefore,                                         determined to test its function with a toxicity test. The product of PRK, RuBP,                                         cannot be metabolized by wild-type E. coli. The accumulation of RuBP                                         depletes                                         the sugar from the native pentose phosphate pathway. Lack of carbon source, the                                         growth of that strain may be repressed. We incubate the PRK expressing strain                                         and control stain that contains no plasmid in M9 medium and altered M9 medium                                         with 4 (g/l) xylose as its sole carbon source. In normal M9 medium, glucose will                                         not be converted into RuBP. In altered M9 medium, xylose will go through the                                         native pathway and be converted into RuBP. Growth arrest of PRK strain should                                         be observed.
We tested PRK in different strains. We first cloned prk into pSB1C3 and                                         transformed into BL21 (DE3). After 12 hours, the strain without plasmid could                                         grow up to 1.4 O.D.600 in altered M9 xylose medium. The strain that contains                                         PRK can grow up to 0.75 O.D.600 in normal M9 medium either. In contrast, the                                         PRK strain that grew in altered M9 xylose medium showed no growth at all. The                                         result shows that PRK can suppress/inhibit the growth, which matches to our                                         expectation.
Fig 3. The result of PRK test in BL21 (DE3). The PRK expressing strain is                                         incubated                                         in both normal M9 medium and altered M9 xylose medium to compare with the                                         strain                                         without plasmid. The PRK expressing strain grown in altered M9 xylose showed                                         merely                                         no growth, which proves the function of PRK.
Although the function of PRK has been confirmed, we would like to lower the                                         expression of it to minimize the growth arrest. We thus cloned the part into                                         pSB3K3, a low copy number plasmid to lower its protein expression. We then                                         compare                                         the growth under high and low copy number plasmid. We found out that pSB3K3                                         shows a                                         little growth arrest comparing to the strain without plasmid. The growth of it                                         exceeds that of PRK expressed in pSB1C3. We can regulate the expression of PRK                                         via                                         high or low copy number plasmid to optimize the growth and carbon fixation                                         efficiency of the bacteria.
Fig 4. Compares the growth in M9 xylose medium of PRK expressing strain which prk is cloned into                                         high                                         and low copy number plasmids respectively. The low copy number plasmid, pSB3K3, shows a little bit of growth retard compare to the control strain. However, its                                         toxicity is much less than that expressed in high copy number.
We also transformed pSB3K3-prk into W3110 strain. W3110 is reported to have                                         higher pressure tolerance. The trend of the results is similar to that of the                                         BL21 (DE3), but the difference between experiement and control group is not obvious                            . We deduce that PRK can still function in W3110 since the                                         trend matches our expectation. As pSB3K3 is a low copy number plasmid, the                                         expression of the protein may be lower than that of high copy number plasmid.                                         The                                         pressure tolerance of W3110 strain may also lessen the influence of toxicity by                                         PRK.

CA (Carbonic Anhydrase)
Achievements:
Construct the ca and transform it into BL21 (DE3)
Run the SDS-PAGE to confirm its expression
Measure the activity of CA enzyme
We cloned the DNA fragments ( BBa_K2762008 ) into pSB1C3 plasmid after the gene                                         is amplified                                         with PCR. We transform the plasmid into DH5 alpha and BL21 (DE3). Next, we                                         confirm its protein expression with SDS-PAGE.
Fig 6. Confirmation of ca digestion Fig 7. Confirmation of CA expression in BL21 (DE3). The expected protein size is                                         27.9kDa.
We then ran the activity test of CA. In our bypass pathway, the function of CA                                         is to                                         convert proton and bicarbonate into water and carbon dioxide. CA activity was determined using the Wilbur-Anderson assay. Briefly, 9 mL ice-cold Tris−HCl (20                                         mM, pH8.3) buffer and 0.2 mL enzyme were mixed and transferred to a 20 mL                                         sample bottle, with further incubation at 0 °C with stirring. Then, 6 mL of                                         ice-cold CO2-saturated solution was added immediately into the sample bottle                                         and the time course (sec) of pH decrease from 8.3 to 6.3 was recorded. CA                                         activity was calculated using a Wilbur–Anderson unit (WAU) per milliliter of                                         sample. The definition for WAU is (T0-T)/ (T0) in which T0 and T was the time required for the pH drop from 8.3 to 6.3, with and without                                         CA, respectively. The enzyme activity of our CA is 21.8                                         unit/liter.                                         To confirm the contribution of the CA to the whole pathway, we also ran the                                         total                                         solution which will be described in the following content.
Rubisco
Achievements:
Construction and digestion of DNA gel shows that the size of it was right
The SDS-PAGE of Rubisco showed that the expression of Rubisco in the expected size
We constructed rubisco fragments from IDT DNA synthesis. After PCR amplification of                                         the three subunits, rubisco is then cloned into pSB1C3 and transformed into DH5 alpha. SDS-PAGE ensured that the protein expression was as expected. The results                                         are shown below:
Fig 8. Confirmation of rbcX and rbcS digestion                                          Fig 9.  Confirmation of rbcX and rbcS expression in BL21 (DE3). The expected protein                                         size is 15.3 kDA and 13.8 kDA respectively.
Fig 10. Confirmation of rbcL digestion. Fig 11. Confirmation of rbcL expression in DH5 alpha. The expected protein size is                                         52.37 kDa.
After mining a lot of information from the publications, we found out a method                                         to determine the activity of Rubisco by thin-layer chromatographic has been                                         reported. However, due to time concern, we are not capable of measuring the                                         enzyme activity of Rubisco with this method. We finally confirm its function                                         from the results of total solution test.

Principle and Mechanism of Xylose Utilzation Index
In the total solution experiment, we strive to measure the carbon fixation amount of each sample. After reading numerous publications, we found out that                                                 previous researches determine the efficiency of carbon fixation via measuring                                                 the decrease of carbon dioxide concentration in the closed system or measure                                                 the weight percentage of 14C radioisotope in the dry cell. However, due to biosafety                                                 constrain of our lab, we can barely use the radioisotope. Measuring the                                                 decrease of carbon dioxide concentration in the closed system is also                                                 impractical for us since we have too much test samples. A new method to measure                                                 multiple samples in the short period of time is developed by our team. We are                                                 able to evaluate the fixation efficiency of each sample with the optical                                                 density                                                 O.D. 600 and xylose consumption. We have measure various construction to prove                                                 that all the enzymes in our design is necessary for carbon fixation.
The bacteria samples in total solution test were incubated in an altered M9 medium which substitutes                                                 glucose to xylose. 1/1000 of LB medium was added to support the trace elements.                                                 Since the concentration of LB medium is too low, it doesn’t contribute the                                                 carbon source of the bacteria.
We defined a new index, Xylose Utilization Index, to describe the potential of                                                 carbon fixation. We can compare this index of each strain to find out the                                                 strain that has the highest capacity of carbon fixation.
To define the XUI, we firstly made two assumptions:
O.D. 600 of the sample has a linear relationship to dry cell weight                                                      (biomass). Optical density is frequently used as a means of describing the                                                     cell density in the broth. We measured the dry cell weight of samples in                                                     different O.D. value and discovered that it has a linear relationship. We                                                     conclude that we can utilize O.D. value to estimate the dry cell weight. 1                                                     0.D. of BL21 (DE3) strain per litter yields the dry cell weight of 0.8 gram.
Fig 12. shows the dry cell weight of BL21 (DE3) incubated in altered M9 xylose                                                 medium.                                                 A linear relationship between O.D. and dry cell weight is observed.
The elemental formula of E. coli should be fixed or varies within a                                                     small range. Although the formula may have variations in different                                                     growth condition, we assume that such error can be ignored during the                                                     following calculation.
After these two assumptions, the Xylose Utilization Index is designed to                                                 evaluate                                                 the carbon fixation ability of each strain. The definition of the index is                                                 xylose                                                 consumption over O.D. 600. O.D. 600 measurement can be viewed as the weight of                                                 carbon of the bacteria. The index shows the ratio of xylose consumption per                                                 biomass. For wild-type E. coli, it only consumes xylose (the sole carbon                                                 source                                                 provided in our medium) as its carbon source. Although some native E. coli pathway                                                 may utilize CO2 (such as lipid synthesis), the amount is too small                                                 to consider.                                                 As                                                 for engineered strain, carbon dioxide can be utilized as it’s carbon source. By                                                 producing the same amount of carbon biomass, it requires less xylose. We can                                                 thus                                                 compare the XUI of each strain to determine the strain that fixes                                                 carbon.                                                 The less the XUI in the sample, the more possibility that it fixes carbon.
$${XUI = {{xylose \  consumption \ (g/l)} \over {O.D. 600}}}$$
We use the Dinitrosalicylic Acid (DNS) reducing sugar assay to measure the                                                 xylose                                                 concentration in the medium. Under base solution, DNS will turn to brown color                                                 while reacting with reductive sugar in high temperature. In the specific                                                 temperature range, the color will have a linear relationship with the reductive                                                 sugar                                                 concentration. We can thus measure the xylose concentration at O.D.540.

Before measuring the XUI, we observe the growth curve of each strain. We found                                                 out                                                 that W3110 (L5T7) constructed strain cannot grow in altered M9 solution.                                                 W3110 (L5T7)                                                 is a newly constructed strain, we are not quite certain its characteristic. We                                                 eliminate this strain from the following experiment. BL21 (DE3) and W3110                                                 constructed strains show little growth after 24 hours.
Fig 14. shows the growth of engineered (contains Rubisco and PRK) W3110 (L5T7), BL21 (DE3), W3110 incubated in normal                                                 incubator for 24 hours. The growth of W3110 (L5T7) is not obvious while other                                                 strains show growth after 24hours.
Total solution check: Function of Rubisco
We then utilized XUI to evaluate the function of each enzyme in the pathway. We                                         first check the function of Rubisco in BL21 (DE3) strain. Rubisco enzyme with promoter PT7 ( BBa_K2762011 ) was cloned into pSB1C3 and PRK                                         with promoter PLacI ( BBa_K2762007 ) was cloned into pSB3K3. Both                                         plasmids were then co-transformed into BL21 (DE3). We                                         measured the XUI of the strain and compared them with the control group that IPTG was not                                         added and BL21 (DE3) without plasmid. IPTG can induce the promoter                                         PT7 to produce the downstream enzyme. The growth of each strain is                                         first examined. The IPTG induced strain showed growth retard. We assume the                                         cause of growth retard is due to the pressure from overexpressing the protein                                         Rubisco. The control strain without IPTG induction produce less Rubisco enzyme                                         than the experiment and has less pressure. We then compare the XUI of each                                         strain and discovered that control strain without IPTG induction produces less                                         Rubisco enzyme than the experiment. Without Rubisco, the bypass pathway is not                                         capable of using CO2. We found out that the strain without Rubisco                                         has higher                                         XUI, symbolizing that Rubisco is essential in the carbon fixation pathway.
Fig 15. Shows the growth and XUI measured in 5% CO2 incubation for 12                                         hours                                         respectively. The strain that contains PRK and Rubisco shows little growth. The XUI of the strain                                         that contains both Rubisco and PRK shows statistically significant decrease                                         compare to strain without both enzymes.
Total solution check: Function of CA
From the above results, we discovered that although Rubisco and                                         PRK alone can enhance the utilization rate of carbon dioxide, the growth and                                         utilization ability didn’t meet our expectations. The third important enzyme                                         came into play: CA enzyme. We cloned Rubisco ( BBa_K2762011 ) into pSB1C3 and                                         cloned PRK with PLacI promoter and CA with PT7 promoter ( BBa_K2762013 )                                         into pSB3K3. Two plasmids are then co-transformed into BL21 (DE3). We measured                                         the                                         XUI of this strain and compare with the previous strain that only contains PRK and Rubisco. We found out that CA can raise the growth and lower the XUI. We                                         infer that CA can enhance the intracellular CO2 concentration and                                         thus increase                                         the carbon flux of the bypass pathway. The efficiency of the bypass pathway is                                         thus been increased.
Fig 16. Shows the growth and XUI comparison of each strain. All the tested                                         strains are incubated in 5% CO2 incubator for 12 hr. 0.1mM of IPTG                                         was added to                                         induce protein expression. We can observe that growth speed of the                                         construction has been increased with the CA and the XUI of the strain that                                         contains complete three enzymes was the lowest compared to the strain without                                         plasmid or the strain that only contains PRK and Rubisco, stating that three                                         enzymes are required to optimize the carbon fixing bypass pathway.
XUI Comparison between BL21 (DE3) and W3110
We then compare the XUI value between BL21 (DE3) and W3110 constructed strain.                                         When we design our IDT sequence, we link the CA directly to the promoter PLacI,                                         so we could not transform CA construct into W3110 strain. We thus compare the                                         XUI of strains that only contains Rubisco and PRK ( BBa_K2762011 ),                                         ( BBa_K2762007 ).                                         We found out that both strains show similar trend: the XUI will                                         be lower with the expression of the constructed protein. The growth condition                                         of both constructed strains is similar for the first 12 hours. We then compare                                         the difference of XUI between two E. coli strain. We found out that both                                         strain                                         shows similar trend: the XUI will be lower with the expression of the constructed protein. However, W3110 has a higher XUI compared with BL21 (DE3) in                                         constructed strain as well as the strain without plasmid. We infer two reasons                                         that cause the difference of XUI:
W3110 “wildtype” strain has more flexible metabolic network. The carbon flux to pentose phosphate pathway of W3110 is more than that of BL21 (DE3) and thus consumes                                             more xylose compare to lab strains such as BL21 (DE3).
The constructed protein expression in W3110 may be less than BL21 (DE3) lab strain. BL21 (DE3) is commonly used to express protein. We inferred that with                                             more protein been expressed, the bypass pathway in BL21 (DE3) will be more                                             favored than the W3110 strain.
Fig 17. Shows the growth and the XUI of BL21 (DE3) and W3110 strains.
We finally concluded that the efficiency of the bypass pathway in BL21 (DE3) is                                         better than that in the W3110 strain.
Incubation under different CO2 concentration
Finally, we compare the XUI under different CO2 concentration. We                                         incubated the engineered                                         bacteria in normal incubator without CO2 input and the cell culture                                         incubator                                         that maintains 5% CO2 concentration. We observed that the strain in                                         5% CO2 incubator has lower the XUI. The supply of sufficient CO2 can                                         increase the efficiency of the bypass pathway and enhance the growth. We can conclude that                                         our constructed pathway can utilize carbon dioxide as one of its carbon                                         source from this result.
Fig 18. The comparison of the growth and the XUI of the BL21 (DE3) that contains                                         all three enzymes in normal incubator and 5% CO2 incubator. The                                         strain grown in                                         CO2 incubator showed better growth and lower XUI, which indicates                                         that our                                         strain can use CO2 as a carbon source in the presence of high CO2 level.
Carbon fixation
Amount of Carbon Fixed: 0.575 mg / l * hr
To find out how much and how efficient genetically engineered E. coli can fix                                                     carbon dioxide, we use the material balance concept to evaluate the                                                     heterotrophic CO2 fixation process. Consider a system composed of a                                                     single                                                     component, the general material balance can be written as:                                                      $${\{Input\ to\ the\ system\}\ –\ \{Output\ to\ the\ system\}\ =\                                                     \{Accumulation\ in\ the\ system\}}$$                                                      A system can be defined as an arbitrary portion of a process considered for                                                     analysis, in which in this case, is an engineered carbon capturing E. coli.
The engineered E. coli BL21 (DE3) is cultured in M9 medium with formula                                                     adjusted so that xylose is the sole carbon source. The aforementioned M9 Medium                                                     contains                                                     4 (g/l) xylose and 1/1000 LB medium (the carbon consumed from LB medium can be                                                     ignored). By applying the law of conservation of mass, which states that mass                                                     may neither be created nor destroyed, the material balance for carbon in an                                                     engineered E. coli may simply be written as                                                      $${\{C_{CO_2}\ in\}\ +\ \{C_{xylose}\}\ -\ \{C_{CO_2}\ out\}\ -\ \{C_{waste}\}\                                                     =\ \{C_{biomass}\}...(1)}$$                                                      Considering the difficulties in measuring carbon in E. coli metabolic                                                     waste and                                                     that Cwaste would be positive, the equation reduces to                                                      $${\{C_{CO_2}\ in\}\ -\ \{C_{CO_2}\ out\}\ ≥\ \{C_{biomass}\}\ -\                                                     \{C_{xylose}\}...(2)}$$                                                      Let {CCO2 net}= {CCO2 in} - {CCO2 out}, equation (2) further simplifies to                                                      $${\{C_{CO_2}\ net\}\ ≥\ \{C_{biomass}\}\ -\ \{C_{xylose}\}...(3)}$$                                                      If Cwaste is very small and negligible, we can obtain the net amount                                                     of carbon                                                     dioxide fixed over time. If, on the contrary, Cwaste cannot be                                                     neglected,                                                     equation (3) allows us to estimate the minimum net amount of carbon dioxide fixed.
Cbiomass can be calculate by multiplying O.D. 600 to DCW and mass                                                     percent of carbon in E. coli biomass. The O.D. 600 of engineered E.                                                         coli is                                                     measured after a 12-hour cultivation and the result obtained is 0.45O.D. . Yin                                                     Li et al. reported that dry cell weight (DCW) of E. coli is                                                      $${0.35g\over L ∙ 𝑂.𝐷. 600}$$                                                      , determined by experiment. E. coli biomass contains 48% of carbon by                                                     mass.                                                      $${C_{biomass}\ =\ 0.4511\ ×\ 0.35\ ×\ 48\%}$$                                                     $${=\ 0.0758\ g/L}$$
On the other hand, Cxylose can be calculated by multiplying the                                                     amount of                                                     xylose consumed per unit volume of broth to the mass percent of carbon in                                                     xylose. Xylose consumption is calculated by using a DNS kit that measures the                                                     concentration of reducing sugar and the result obtained is 0.1723g of xylose                                                     consumed per liter of M9 medium. Carbon mass percentage of xylose                                                     is 40%.                                                      $${C_{xylose}\ =\ 0.1723\ ×\ 40\%\ =\ 0.0689\ g/L}$$                                                      By equation (3)                                                      $${C_{CO_2\ net}\ =\ 0.0758\ -\ 0.0689}$$                                                      $${=\ 0.0069\ g/L}$$                                                      Since the E. coli has been cultured for 12 hours, we can calculate the                                                     rate of                                                     carbon fixation by                                                      $${Rate\ of\ carbon\ fixation\ =\ {𝐶_{𝐶𝑂_2\ 𝑛𝑒𝑡}\over 12}}$$                                                      $${=\ {0.0069\over 12}}$$                                                      $${=\ 0.575\ {mg\over L ∙hr}}$$                                                      To find out how much carbon in biomass comes from the carbon in CO2 captured by the heterotrophic microbes, we can divide equation (3) by the mass percentage of carbon in biomass:
$${{{ \{ CO_{2 net}} \} \over \{ {C_{biomass}} \} } \geq {1 -   { \{ {C_{xylose}} \} \over \{ {C_{biomass}} \} }}}$$
We can thus calculate the ratio with our experiment results:
$${{Ratio \ of \ carbon \ in \ CO_2 \ fixed \ to \ carbon \ in \ biomass} = {1 -{0.0689 \over 0.0758}} = 9.1 \%}$$

Construction of the pH sensing system
We construct both promoters with PCR, using primer as templates since the size                                         of it is small. For the construction of Pasr, we cloned into the                                         plasmid that                                         contains both rbs and GFP. For the construction of PgadA, we took                                         the                                         constructed part from 2016 Dundee iGEM team as a reference. Both parts were                                         then cloned into pSB1C3 plasmid and transformed into BL21 (DE3).
Fluorescence intensity measurement of Pasr
Pasr ( BBa_K1231000 ) is reported to be induced in acidic condition. We think that it                                         can be used                                         to report the abnormal acidity of the medium. We thus determine to measure the                                         fluorescence intensity in a short period of time. We first incubated the                                         bacteria to log phase (within 2 hour) with LB medium. We then centrifuged the                                         broth and suspended the pellet with pH modified M9 medium (the pH value is                                         modified with 1M HCl). We then took the sample and incubate in the 96 well and                                         measure its fluorescence intensity for every 3 minutes. We found out that the                                         promoter Pasr will be induced at the pH value below four within 30 minutes. The                                         different fluorescence intensity can be observed within 30 minutes. The                                         fluorescence had the peak at pH value of 4.25.
Fig 19. The data shows the fluorescence intensity (absorbance: 485 nm,                                         excitation:                                         535 nm) expressed by Pasr in different pH.
Based on the data has shown above, we could conclude that Pasr is an acidic                                         promoter as it has a high expression of fluorescence at pH 4.25 and pH 5. The                                         results show that Pasr constructed pH sensing system can be used as an alert.                                         When the medium turns acidic, fluorescence can be easily observed. We believe                                         that this system can also be applied to various bio-detection system.
Fluorescence intensity measurement of PgadA
PgadA ( BBa_K1962013 ) was previously reported to be induced under neutral and mild                                         acidic                                         environment. We measured the fluorescence intensity for 14 hours. We pre-cultured                                         the strain and incubate the strain with pH modified M9 medium (the pH value is                                         modified with 1M HCl). The induction of PgadA is observed under                                         neutral and                                         weak acidic environment.
Fig 20. The data shows the fluorescence intensity (absorbance: 485 nm,                                         excitation: 535 nm) expressed by PgadA in different pH.
Improvement of PgadA
We found out that the fluorescence intensity of PgadA is much lower                                         than the                                         Pasr and would like to improve the sensitivity of this biobrick. We                                         thus add a                                         RiboJ sequence at the downstream of PgadA. RiboJ sequence is reported to increase the expression of downstream protein. We thus compare the fluorescence of previous and improved biobrick. We discover that with RiboJ, the protein of down-stream reporter protein is increased.
Fig 21. The data compares the fluorescence of PgadA and PgadA with RiboJ sequence.
