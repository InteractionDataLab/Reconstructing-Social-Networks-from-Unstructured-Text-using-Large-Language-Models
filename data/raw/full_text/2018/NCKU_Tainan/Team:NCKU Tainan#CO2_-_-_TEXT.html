CO2 Sensor
Motivation Experiments Wiring Reference
About this section, we are showing how to use the CO2 sensor in Arduino.
Motivation
We want to detect if the CO2 concentration at the outlet is decreasing as                                         expected.
Experiments
Experiment 1: Instrument calibration
Purpose
Because the analog value returned by each sensor may be inaccurate, and                                                 the carbon dioxide concentration in each area may be slightly                                                 different, it must be corrected before use.
Method
Connect the power supply to 3.3V and use arduino to measure the                                                 analog value of output A0. Its stable value is about 3.3/5*1024=675.84.
Let the sensor enter a steady state and operate in an unventilated                                                 environment for at least 48 hours.
At this time, the analog value of the atmospheric carbon dioxide                                                 concentration (about 400 ppm) was measured, and we measured 705 ppm.
The known carbon dioxide concentration is adjusted by a CO2 incubator, and the ppm can be obtained according to the formula                                                 conversion, and the analog value of the concentration is obtained. Ex: We put the carbon dioxide sensor into 5% carbon dioxide and                                                 measured its analog value to 530 ppm.
We assume that the carbon dioxide logarithmic concentration is                                                 negatively linearly related to the output analog value, and can be                                                 found by the known two points.
Formula
X% = 10000X ppm Ex: 5% CO2 concentration = 50000 ppm
Let we assume the unknown CO2 concentration is C ppm.
$$slope={V_{50000}-V_{400}\over                                                 log50000-log400}={V-V_{400}\over logC-log400}$$
From the graph, we have shown that V50000 = 530 、V400 = 705
Therefore, we can get the slope value.
After shifting the equation we will get
$${logC-log400}={V-V_{400}\over slope}$$ $$C={10^{log400+{V-V_{400}\over slope}}}$$
We can then get the unknown CO2 concentration from this formula.
Picture
We put CO2 sensor into the CO2 incubator and measure its analog value.
Experiment 2: CO2 trend line verification
Purpose
To verify whether the logarithmic concentration of carbon dioxide is                                                 negatively linear with the output analog value.
Method
Use a CO2 incubator to adjust the known carbon dioxide concentration and measure its analogy to see if it is on this line.
Result
We put our sensor in the environment of CO2 2.7%, and we measured that                                                 the analog value 550, which is quite match with the theoretical analog                                                 value 552.
Precaution
It is best to preheat for the first time for 24 hours, use it for more than                                             six hours, preheat for 1-2 hours, power off for more than 72 hours, and                                             preheat for 24 hours.
