Arduino
We use temperature sensor(DS18B20)ï¿½BpH meter and CO2 sensor(MG811) to monitor our                   device. Besides, we use LCD to print datum and use Wi-Fi sensor(ESP8266) to upload                   our records to database as well.

Aliquam a mi eget nisi cursus molestie nec sit amet                   felis.
Database
In order to save data from our device, we set up a database in Firebase, including                   carbon dioxide concentration, pH value and temperature obtained by sensors in our                   device.
App
To make our device more user-friendly, we designed an app to get data from our                   database. The manager of the factory can easily see the data immediately. Besides,                   we set up a notification system. As long as users connect their smart phone to the                   internet, they c`an immediately get the warning notification from the device if the                   data goes wrong.
