The Xylose Utilization Index (XUI)
In the total solution experiment,                                     we strive to measure the carbon fixation amount of each sample.                                     After reading numerous publications,                                     we found out that previous researches determine the efficiency of carbon fixation                                     via measuring the decrease of carbon dioxide concentration in the closed system or                                     measure                                     the weight percentage of 14C radioisotope in the dry cell.                                     However, due to biosafety constrain of our lab, we can barely use the radioisotope.                                     Measuring the decrease of carbon dioxide concentration in the closed system is also                                     impractical for us since we have too much test samples.                                     A new method to measure multiple samples in the short period of time is developed                                     by our team.                                     We are able to evaluate the fixation efficiency of each sample with optical density                                     O.D. 600 and                                     xylose consumption. We have measure various construction to prove that the enzyme                                     of our construction                                     is necessary for carbon fixation.
The test samples below were incubated in a modified M9 medium which                                     substitutes xylose for glucose.                                     1/1000 of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium was added to support trace elements.                                     Since the concentration of LB medium is too low, it doesn‚Äôt contribute to the                                     carbon source of the bacteria.
We defined a new index, Xylose Utilization Index (XUI),                                     to describe the potential of carbon fixation.                                     We can compare this index of each strain to find out the strain that has highest                                     capacity of carbon fixation.
To define the XUI, we firstly made two assumptions:
O.D. 600 of the sample has linear relationship to dry cell                                         weight (biomass).                                         Optical density is frequently used as a means of describing the cell density in                                         the broth.                                         We measured the dry cell weight of samples in different O.D. value and                                         discovered that it has linear relationship.                                         We conclude that we can utilize O.D. value to estimate the dry cell weight.                                         1 O.D. of BL21 (DE3) strain per litre yields the dry cell weight of 0.8 gram.
Fig 1. shows the dry cell weight of BL21 (DE3) incubated in                                             modified M9 xylose medium. A linear relationship between O.D. and dry cell                                             weight is observed.
The elemental formula of E. coli should be fixed or                                         varies within a small range.                                         Although the formula may have variations in different growth condition,                                         we assume that such error can be ignore during the following calculation.
Combining these two assumptions, we can conclude that in a fixed                                     O.D. 600 value,                                     the composite weight of carbon is also fixed.                                     Thus, O.D. 600 can be considered equivalent to carbon weight of the bacteria.
After these two assumptions,                                     the XUI is designed to evaluate the carbon fixation ability of each strain.                                     The definition of the index is xylose consumption over O.D. 600.                                     O.D. 600 measurement can be viewed as the weight of carbon of the bacteria.                                     The index shows the ratio of xylose consumption per biomass.                                     For wild type E. coli, it only consumes xylose (the sole carbon source                                     provided by the medium)                                     as its carbon source. Although some native E. coli pathway may utilize CO2 (such as lipid synthesis), the amount is too small to be considered.                                     As for engineered strain, carbon dioxide can be utilized as its carbon source.                                     By producing same amount of carbon biomass, it requires less xylose.                                     We can thus compare the XUI of each strain to determine the strain that fix carbon.                                     The less the XUI in the sample, the more possibility that it fix carbon.
$${XUI = {{xylose \ consumption \ (g/l)} \over {O.D. 600}}}$$
We use the XUI to compare the carbon fixation efficiency of                                     each strain and prove the function of each system.                                     For the experiment result, please view the Result(hyperlink) page.
Carbon Fixation amount estimation
To find out how much and how efficient genetically engineered E.                                         coli can fix                                     carbon dioxide, we use the material balance concept to evaluate the heterotrophic                                     CO2 fixation process.                                     Consider a system composed of a single component, the general material balance can                                     be written as:                                     $${\{Input\ to\ the\ system\}\ ‚Äì\ \{Output\ to\ the\ system\}\ =\                                     \{Accumulation\ in\ the\ system\}}$$                                      A system can be defined as an arbitrary portion of a process considered for                                     analysis,                                     in which in this case, is an engineered carbon capturing E. coli.
The engineered E. coli BL21 (DE3) is cultured in M9 medium with formula                                     adjusted so that xylose is the sole carbon source. The aforementioned M9 Medium                                     contains                                     4 (g/l) xylose and 1/1000 LB medium (the carbon consumed from LB medium can be                                     ignored). By applying the law of conservation of mass, which states that mass                                     may neither be created nor destroyed, the material balance for carbon in an                                     engineered E. coli may simply be written as                                      $${\{C_{CO_2}\ in\}\ +\ \{C_{xylose}\}\ -\ \{C_{CO_2}\ out\}\ -\ \{C_{waste}\}\                                     =\ \{C_{biomass}\}...(1)}$$                                      Considering the difficulties in measuring carbon in E. coli metabolic                                     waste and                                     that Cwaste would be positive, the equation reduces to                                      $${\{C_{CO_2}\ in\}\ -\ \{C_{CO_2}\ out\}\ ‚â•\ \{C_{biomass}\}\ -\                                     \{C_{xylose}\}...(2)}$$                                      Let {CCO2 net}= {CCO2 in} - {CCO2 out}, equation (2) further simplifies to                                      $${\{C_{CO_2}\ net\}\ ‚â•\ \{C_{biomass}\}\ -\ \{C_{xylose}\}...(3)}$$                                      If Cwaste is very small and negligible, we can obtain the net amount                                     of carbon                                     dioxide fixed over time. If, on the contrary, Cwaste cannot be                                     neglected,                                     equation (3) allows us to estimate the minimum net amount of carbon dioxide                                     fixed.
Cbiomass can be calculate by multiplying O.D. 600 to DCW and mass                                     percent of carbon in E. coli biomass. The O.D. 600 of engineered E.                                         coli is                                     measured after a 12-hour cultivation and the result obtained is 0.45O.D. . Yin                                     Li et al. reported that dry cell weight (DCW) of E. coli is                                      $${0.35g\over L ‚àô ùëÇ.ùê∑. 600}$$                                      , determined by experiment. E. coli biomass contains 48% of carbon by                                     mass.                                      $${C_{biomass}\ =\ 0.4511\ √ó\ 0.35\ √ó\ 48\%}$$                                     $${=\ 0.0758\ g/L}$$
On the other hand, Cxylose can be calculated by multiplying the                                     amount of                                     xylose consumed per unit volume of broth to the mass percent of carbon in                                     xylose. Xylose consumption is calculated by using a DNS kit that measures the concentration of reducing sugar and the result obtained is 0.1723g of xylose                                     consumed per liter of M9 medium. Carbon mass percentage of xylose                                     is 40%.                                      $${C_{xylose}\ =\ 0.1723\ √ó\ 40\%\ =\ 0.0689\ g/L}$$                                      By equation (3)                                      $${C_{CO_2\ net}\ =\ 0.0758\ -\ 0.0689}$$                                      $${=\ 0.0069\ g/L}$$                                      Since the E. coli has been cultured for 12 hours, we can calculate the                                     rate of                                     carbon fixation by                                      $${Rate\ of\ carbon\ fixation\ =\ {ùê∂_{ùê∂ùëÇ_2\ ùëõùëíùë°}\over 12}}$$                                      $${=\ {0.0069\over 12}}$$                                      $${=\ 0.575\ {mg\over L ‚àôhr}}$$                                      To find out how much carbon in biomass comes from the carbon in CO2 captured by the                                     heterotrophic microbes, we can divide equation (3) by the mass percentage of carbon                                     in biomass:
$${{{ \{ CO_{2 net}} \} \over \{ {C_{biomass}} \} } \geq {1 -                                     { \{ {C_{xylose}} \} \over \{ {C_{biomass}} \} }}}$$
We can thus calculate the ratio with our experiment results:
$${{Ratio \¬†of¬†\ carbon¬†\ in \¬†CO_2 \¬†fixed \¬†to \¬†carbon \¬†in                                     \¬†biomass} =                                     {1 -{0.0689 \over 0.0758}} = 9.1 \%}$$
