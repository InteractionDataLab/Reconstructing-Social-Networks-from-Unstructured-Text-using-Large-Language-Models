                      Our project focused on a current problem that is not given due attention, depression and anxiety disorders. There is a large number of uninformed people on the subject, since many are barely aware of the symptoms or causes of a depressive or anxious disorder and due to the above, people tend to normalize these diseases by letting them pass indefinitely without giving them adequate treatment. 
                    </P><P class="text text-left"> In addition to developing a psychobiotic that can combat the adverse effects of stress that causes inflammation in the body and leads to depression or anxiety, the team wanted to take advantage of their intervention in the topic to help create awareness layers through social networks and thus promote the preventive culture and encourage people to ask for help when necessary. On the other hand, several events were created in our community where experts on the subject were invited to give the public the opportunity to express their doubts and share their experiences. From our human practices and the feedback obtained from these, the goal of our project was shaped to become what it is now.
