The team managed to gather sequences in the registry and modified them in order to improve a) purification and b) could be used in Lactobacillus rhamnosus species; since the registry contains mainly E. coli parts, it might be useful as well, to design and obtain sequences that can be expressed on one or the other but both.                       The following sequences were codon optimized for use in the previous microorganisms mentioned.
We managed to test some of these pieces when characterizing our signal peptide for secretion of                     recombinant proteins collection Parts and we obtained the following results:
