</H6><H3> Resume </H3><H6 style="color#00008B"> The first activity of human practices we did as a team, was to request the support of a professional, this with the goal of commenting our ideas and asking him or her,  to guide us in the process of being able to help people from all social sectors with our project. This is how the team visited psychologist Carmina Gudiño´s office, who provided us with reliable information about depression and anxiety disorders. She answered all the questions we had, as well as reviewed and approved all the material and information prepared for the human practices activities. She also gave us information about some established myths about depression and anxiety, and how these symptoms are sometimes normalized by society.
</H6><H6>
Because of this, we decided to give a lecture about basic information, and the most common symptoms of depression and anxiety in an Institution named Galilea 2000 A.C.</H6><H5> Galilea 2000 A.C</H5><H6 style="color#00008B"><B>Insights: </B> Lack of comprehension. We should see the disease from the true eyes of a person with the disease. 
</H6><H6 style="color#00008B"><B>Changes: </B> We develop a truthful motivation for helping people. 
</H6><H3> Resume </H3><H6> This association, gives shelter and provide assistance to relatives of patients who are treated in a hospital near by the area of the institution. We considered this group as one with a higher possibility of suffering depression and anxiety, due to the environment they have to be, at the time their relatives suffer a specific type of illness.  </H6><H6> Because of this, we gave a lecture. Our objective was to generate awareness that both, depression and anxiety are diseases that need to be treated as such, otherwise they can have severe consequences of different type including suicide. 
</H6><H6> On the lecture we gave basic information of the disease, as well as information of public and private institutions able to provide help and support.
</H6><H6> At the beginning of the lecture we asked the persons to fill some questions, the questions were written on a cardboard and we gave them stickers, so the registry was their answer  (since the questions were true or false). 
</H6><H6> Throughout the talk the great majority of the assistants showed interest on the topic and on the information given, since they are in a vulnerable state we believe that it might be easier for them to understand the relevance of mental illnesses.
</H6><H6> At the end, we asked the people to answer the same questions as the beginning, to measure the impact of our presentation. 
</H6><H6>
We considered this activity a potential success since the information was of great importance for those who are in need of help.  W.H.O. has also recognized that the stigmatization of depression and lack of availability for treatment is still prevalent. In Mexico, mental illnesses continues to be a taboo, with the increasing depression events in the population, this sort of talks are necessary. Our plan is to keep pushing towards an open dialogue for depression. 
</H6><H5> More about Galilea 2000 A.C: </H5><H6> This institution gives integral and humanitarian help to patients of a hospital named Hospital Civil de Guadalajara and their relatives. Help provided includes emotional, medical or nutritional, throughout programs intended to motivate people to improve their way of living.

</H6><H3> Resume </H3><H6> Our team went to the company Kurago Biotek, experts in cultures of beneficial and active living microorganisms along with nutrients, to talk with them and receive feedback on the initial strategy that we thought to carry out, which was to use E. coli bacteria for realization of our psychobiotic. The company advised us to use a well-known probiotic, such as L. rhamnosus, since its benefits have been well studied and its good acceptance by the human body is known. On the other hand, they advised us to use E. coli only to test our work before passing it on to L. rhamnosus, since it would be easier to test its functioning first in E. coli.

Subsequently, the experts talked about definitions, myths, truths and situations in particular of depression and anxiety. Finally, there was a time for attendees to express their doubts or share their experiences.
</H6><H6> From this event, we realized that depression not only affects people with low economic resources, who have had some loss or suffer from another serious illness, but that all those exposed to stress become vulnerable to develop a disorder depressed or anxious, like students. This helped us along with our market studies to define the audience to which our product would be directed.
