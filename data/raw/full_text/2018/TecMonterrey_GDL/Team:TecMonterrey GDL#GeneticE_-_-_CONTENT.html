                      Lactobachill has to have the ability to secrete our anti-inflammatory
                      molecule to stop the IL-6 pathway once it has sensed an increase in the
                      nitrosative stress levels of the body. To do so, we investigated in the literature
                      about different secretion pathways that bacteria use and we came up with the
                      Sec-dependent pathway, shared between many bacterial species. The transport
                      of material from the cytoplasm to the extracellular matrix through this
                      pathway is completely dependent on the Sec protein. The latter detects specific
                      sets of signal peptides attached to proteins and carries them to the cytoplasmic
                      membrane, where the peptide is cleaved and then the protein is released to the
                      perisplamic region. We realized that if we attached one of these signal peptides
                      to our heterologous protein, our microorganism would be able to secrete it.
                      Before we adventured ourselves into the mysterious waters of using
                      synthetic biology on the Lactobacillus genre, we wanted to try this strategy
                      first in our model organism: E. coli as a proof of concept. To do so we designed
                      two genetic constructs where two different secretion peptides (NSP2 and NSP4)
                      were attached to the N-terminus of the fluorescent iLOV reporter protein,
                      followed by a histidine tag to facilitate purification of the reporter and further
                      detection assays. Both constructs are shown in the following figures:

                      To have a better experimental design, we needed to design two other
                      constructs, a positive control and a negative control. For the positive control,
                      we followed the same layout except we used an already characterized signal
                      peptide: DbASS, which is already found in the iGEM registry. As for the
                      negative control, we did the same thing, but of course we did not attach any
                      signal peptide to the fluorescent protein. Both genetic designs are shown in the
                      following figures:

                      Now that our constructs had arrived, the first thing we did was clone
                      them inside the pSB1C3 plasmid. The details of the experimental conditions we
                      followed can be observed in the Protocols section of this wiki. Afterwards, we
                      proceeded to transform our E. coli BL21 strain using the chemical method.

                      Although our bacteria were able to grow in chloramphenicol, meaning
                      they had in fact been transformed, we could not be sure if they only had the
                      plasmid itself or actually our genetic constructs. That is why we performed
                      miniprep to each colony, digested it and ran the results in an electrophoresis
                      gel, which can be observed in Figure 6.

                      bands of the linearized plasmid pSB1C3. Both cases fell within the expected
                      range of molecular weight according to the ladder.

                      Now that we knew that we had our transformed colonies and that the
                      ligation had been performed successfully, we were able to move forward and
                      proceed with the induction, synthesis and purification of our proteins.
                      
                      As we know, iLOV is a fluorescent protein and since a signal secretion
                      peptide was attached to it, it would have been easy just to place samples of the
                      supernatants inside a fluorescence reading equipment to evaluate whether the
                      protein was being properly released to the media. However, we could not take
                      ahold of a fluorescence reader because of the lack of resources. Still, we were
                      able to isolate our protein due to the histidine tag that was placed at the C-
                      terminus of the iLOV protein in each of our 4 constructs. First, we filtered the
                      supernatant using a 10 kDa Amicon membrane to concentrate our protein and
                      then using a His purification kit provided by Promega®, we were able to purify
                      our desired protein. To verify this, we ran our sample through a
                      polyacrylamide gel. In Figure 7, we can observe the results of this SDS-PAGE
                      assay. We can note the bands fall where they were expected to be between the
                      10 and 15 kDa of molecular weight. Since there was not a signal peptide
                      attached to the negative control, iLOV was not secreted to the media, which is
                      why we could not see it in the SDS-PAGE of the supernatant.

                      Even though the histidine purification kit was very specific, we still had
                      coelutions in our polyacrylamide gel and we could not be a hundred percent
                      sure that the bands we saw only corresponded to the iLOV protein. At last, to
                      finish with the characterization we executed a Western Blot assay using that
                      very same SDS-Page gel. The antibody we used was specific for the 6-His tags
                      we had incorporated into our recombinant proteins. This can be better
                      visualized by taking a look at Figure 8.

                      We feel very pleased about what we achieved during this experimental
                      part because we were able to characterize two new and different signal
                      peptides that will be useful not only for us, but for everyone else who wishes to
                      perform secretion-related experiments and projects using E. coli. We did not
                      just contribute with these new parts, but made and tested a whole experimental
                      design with both positive and negative controls that made our results more
                      valid. Moreover, we incorporated in our designs the possibility of using
                      different purification and detection methods such as affinity chromatography
                      or Western Blot by the use of histidine tags. However, we are aware that
                      further studies need to be carried out to now test the efficiency of this
                      proposed secretion mechanism.

                      In order for Lactobachill to help with the treatment and prevention of both
                      depression and anxiety, it needs to block the IL-6 trans pathway. As stated
                      before, to do this we propose two different strategies. The first one consists on
                      the secretion of the IL-6 soluble signal transducer, sgp130, which will bind to
                      the IL-6-soluble receptor complex and prevent it from attaching to the cell
                      membrane; thus stopping this unspecific inflammation pathway. The genetic
                      design that will enable Lactobachill to synthesize this molecule is found in
                      Figure 9. Again, we decided to test this strategy first using our model organism
                      E. coli, so this construct is optimized for it.

                      constitutive promoter that enables the translation and transduction of the NsrR
                      repressor protein that will attach to the PyeaR promoter and modulate its
                      expression. Next to the NsrR gene we find the iLOV reporter that will be
                      synthesized at the same time as the repressor and will help us keep track of its
                      expression. After the terminator we find the inducible pyeaR promoter that
                      starts the expression of the soluble signal transducer. Attached to sgp130 we
                      find the NSP4 secretion peptide as well as another reporter protein: mCherry.

                      The genetic design for plan A was successfully synthesized and cloned
                      into the pSB1C3 plasmid, which later was inserted into E. coli. To test this, a
                      PCR for the transformed colonies was carried out and then ran inside an
                      electrophoresis gel, which can be observed in Figure 10.

                      As we mentioned, we had a second strategy for Lactobachill to block the
                      trans signaling IL-6 pathway, which we decided to call Plan B. Plan B consists
                      on the secretion of a mutated soluble IL-6 receptor, Mutgp80, that will bind to
                      IL-6 forming a complex that cannot attach to the membrane-bound transducer
                      and this way is not able to continue with the inflammation pathway. The
                      genetic construct that will make Plan B possible in E. coli is shown in Figure 11.
                      However, since the genetic design was rather big to be synthesized in a single
                      piece of DNA and we could not afford customized DNA synthesis, we had it
                      split into two parts.

                      Both parts were inserted into our model organism using the same

                      colonies PCR containing both parts are also shown in Figure 10.
                      
                      Unfortunately we had neither time nor enough resources to characterize these
                      parts and actually test their functionality. Still, both parts were submitted to
                      the registry and we are still working on the project to bring Lactobachill close
                      to those who need it the most.
