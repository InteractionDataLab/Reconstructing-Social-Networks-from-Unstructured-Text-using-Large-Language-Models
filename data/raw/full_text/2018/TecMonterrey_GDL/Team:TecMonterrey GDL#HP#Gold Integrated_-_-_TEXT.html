MANUAL
As we were working in our project, we realized how many people think depression is a common situation everybody lives, and they do not realize, this is a disease that must be treated.
Depression and anxiety need to be diagnosed by a Psychologist. This manual only gives basic information like common symptoms, causes, and institutions where people with this disease or ailing can receive some help. Similarly, we seek to share situations that involve depression or anxiety, so that people who suffer from any of these disorders feel accompanied by knowing the experiences of other people and how they managed to overcome it.
This document is not intended to replace a medical professional diagnose and or opinion on the matter.
CONECTA
The purpose of our project was shared on the news portal of our school "CONECTA", as well as the disclosure of some events that we organized. This in order to have the participation of our student community and family or other friends.
