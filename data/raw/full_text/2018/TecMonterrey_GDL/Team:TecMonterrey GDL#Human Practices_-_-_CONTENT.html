        Our project focused on a current problem that is not given due attention, depression and anxiety disorders. There is a large number of uninformed people on the subject, since many are barely aware of the symptoms or causes of a depressive or anxious disorder and due to the above, people tend to normalize these diseases by letting them pass indefinitely without giving them adequate treatment. In addition to developing a psychobiotic that can combat the adverse effects of stress that causes inflammation in the body and leads to depression or anxiety, the team wanted to take advantage of their intervention in the topic to help create awareness layers through social networks and thus promote the preventive culture and encourage people to ask for help when necessary.
    </P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12"><P style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px">
        On the other hand, several events were created in our community where experts on the subject were invited to give the public the opportunity to express their doubts and share their experiences. From our human practices and the feedback obtained from these, the goal of our project was shaped to become what it is now.

We considered this group as one with a higher possibility of suffering depression and anxiety, due to the environment they have to be, at the time their relatives suffer a specific type of illness. Because of this, we gave a lecture. Our objective was to generate awareness that both, depression and anxiety are diseases that need to be treated as such, otherwise they can have severe consequences of different type including suicide. On the lecture we gave basic information of the disease, as well as information of public and private institutions able to provide help and support.</P><P>At the beginning of the lecture we asked the persons to fill some questions, the questions were written on a cardboard and we gave them stickers, so the registry was their answer  (since the questions were true or false). Throughout the talk the great majority of the assistants showed interest on the topic and on the information given, since they are in a vulnerable state we believe that it might be easier for them to understand the relevance of mental illnesses. At the end, we asked
        the people to answer the same questions as the beginning, to measure the impact of our presentation. </P><P>We considered this activity a potential success since the information was of great importance for those who are in need of help.  W.H.O. has also recognized that the stigmatization of depression and lack of availability for treatment is still prevalent.

The event was held in the congress center of our university and was planned based on the idea of a coffee talk. At the beginning of the event the project of our team was presented and a brief introduction of the event was given to put in context those present. Subsequently, the experts talked about definitions, myths, truths and situations in particular of depression and anxiety. Finally, there was a time for attendees to express their doubts or share their experiences.
          From this event, we realized that depression not only affects people with low economic resources, who have had some loss or suffer from another serious illness, but that all those exposed to stress become vulnerable to develop a disorder depressed or anxious, like students. This helped us along with our market studies to define the audience to which our product would be directed.

The school has two schedules, it has different groups in the morning and in the afternoon, we attended both turns. After the chat was finished we proceeded organize a jeopardy for the teenagers to play, we divided the alumni into four groups, we gave each group a chance to pick a category: biotechnology, microbiology &amp; biology, daily life and sustainable development.  At the very end, we awarded the teams with candies equivalent to the points they had earned. We received a very positive response from the students, and the director invited us to return in the next school period.
