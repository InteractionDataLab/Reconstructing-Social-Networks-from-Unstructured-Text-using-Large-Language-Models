Abstract
This year, Jilin_China made a RNA-based thermosensor toolkit for users,  which includes four types of RNA-based thermosensors: heat-inducible, heat-repressible, cold-inducible and cold-repressible RNA-based thermosensors. But due to the numbers of cold-inducible RNA-based thermosensors is less than 10, which can't meet the number requirement(more than 10) of collection, we added three types of collections to the parts registry as follows:
heat-inducible RNA-based thermosensor collection, heat-repressible RNA-based thermosensor collection and cold-repressible RNA-based thermosensor collection.
In order to make it easier for users to select an appropriate RNA-based thermosensor, we also developed a search engine for our toolkit, you can click here to enter the search engine page.
The introduction of each type of part collection is as follows:
Heat-inducible RNA-based thermosensor collection
In this collection, we provide a total of 48 different Heat-inducible RNA-based thermosensors, which can regulate the expression of genes with the changed temperature. The RNA-based thermosensors we designed has been characterized and mathematically fitted to prove that they have different melting temperature, expression intensity and sensitivity. Users can choose the appropriate RNA-based thermosensors according to their own needs.

Heat-repressible RNA-based thermosensor collection
In order to make our RNA-based thermosensor toolkit more suitable for users' needs, we updated the toolkit to version 2.0. We added the RNase E-based heat-repressible RNA-based thermosensors, including 23 different thermosensors. The stem-loop structure of the thermosensor contains the RNase E cleavage site. At the elevated temperature, the cleavage site is exposed, and the mRNA will be degraded, which turns the translation off.

Cold-inducible RNA-based thermosensor collection
To expand the melting temprerature range of the thermosenor, we have made a second upgrade to the toolkit. In toolkit 3.0, we added cold-repressible and cold-inducible RNA thermosenor, and made 8 cold-inducible RNA-based thermosensors into the part collection.

To expand the melting temprerature range of the thermosenor, we have made a second upgrade to the toolkit. In toolkit 3.0, we added cold-repressible and cold-inducible RNA thermosenor, and made 10 cold-repressible RNA-based thermosensors into a part collection.
Cold-repressible RNA-based thermosensor is based on the RNase III. The stem-loop of the thermosensor mRNA contains the recognition and cleavage site of RNase III. When the temperature is lower than the melting temperature, the RNase III will degrade the mRNA.
