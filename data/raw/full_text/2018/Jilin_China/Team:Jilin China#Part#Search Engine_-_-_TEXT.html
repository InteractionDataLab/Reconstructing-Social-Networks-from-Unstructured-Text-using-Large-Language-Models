We develop a SynRT Toolkit search engine -- SynRT Explorer, which allows users to choose an appropriate thermosensor. Users can select the melting temperature, relative intensity and sensitivity of thermosensors, and the Explorer will give you the information of part number, part name, predicted secondary structure, features and fitted curve. The secondary structure is predicted by mfold software. The fitted curve is based on our experimental results, and then we compute these features. (Please try Chrome to view this page.)
Using SynRT Explorer to pick your thermosensors!
Choose Temperature First:
Then is Intensity
Next is Sensitivity

Tips: If the explorer don't show any thermosensors, it means that there is no appropriate thermosensors, you can also change the features to a similar value.
