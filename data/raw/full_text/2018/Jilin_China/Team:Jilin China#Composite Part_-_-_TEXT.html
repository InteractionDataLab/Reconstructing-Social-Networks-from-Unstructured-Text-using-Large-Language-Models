The thermosensor sequence is constructed on the pSB1C3 vector by Golden Gate assembly. The measurement device is composed of Anderson promotor (BBa_J23104), thermosensor sequence, sfGFP_optimism (BBa_K2541400) and double terminator (BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012). We select a constitutive Anderson promoter J23104 as an appropriate promoter by pre-experiment. The sfGFP_optimism has faster folding speed and higher fluorescence intensity. The double terminator can reduce leakage (Figure 1). We characterized RNA-based thermosensors in E.coli DH5a.
