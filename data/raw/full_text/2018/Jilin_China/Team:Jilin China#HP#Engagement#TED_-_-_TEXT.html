Why TEDx?
A TEDx event is organized by volunteers from the local community, and just like TED events, it lacks any commercial, religious, or political agenda. Its goal is to spark conversation, connection, and community. --from Wikipedia
TEDxJLU has gain its reputation among Jilin University and even the city for its seasonally held sharing conferences and monthly culture salon, which attracted thousands of top students who have strong passion. Previous teams have held events about synthetic biology before. But due to the Giant Jamboree is going to be held ahead of this year’s sharing conferences, we decided to hold a salon.
Suggestions First
We consulted the president of TEDxJLU Club, for advises about contents of this event, and publication methods. He suggested us:
1. It’s an public activity, contents should be attractive and comprehensible enough for people who are not at your major.
We neglected this issue, indeed. We are more serious to the contents this time but make it harder to understand and more boring. Hence, we decided to add more living examples to our speech, meanwhile bring back the activity we used in junior classes – “Built Gene Circuit” by the “Cir-Kit”.
2. Pay attention to the time. it’s not a class, too short will be useless, but too long will be sleeping.
We reorganized our strategy, arranging more teammates to stand on the stage, while they will be distributed parts of speech respectively.
Regenesis!
TEDxJLU - Regenesis was held successfully at the multi-function hall in our library! More than 100 people came to take part in it and, including some outside JLU. We were amazed at the attractiveness of life science and synthetic biology. After a brief introduction of our team, one of our team members told a story about the history of synthetic biology. Then, a group of people raised hands to build circuits! With the guidance of our teammate, telling them what IPTG, LacI, promoter are, some of them successfully build the circuit!
The next part is the introduction of iGEM and Jilin_China, which inspired them to join Jilin_China and become a iGEMer. Then, the relationship between model and biology was illustrated in a easy way followed by a introduction of the project this year. Every team member put their effort in the organization, speech and souvenir providing. When the conference finished, some of the students came to us asking questions like:
‘What’re the potential use of your project?’
‘How can I become an iGEMer?’
‘How will be the future of synthetic biology?’
We were definitely relieved to hear such questions, which proved that our activity did spark curiosity among adults, especially students. Feeling fortunate to be who give inspirations to the next generation, we hope that they could keep their mind in exploring truth and creating something brand new.
