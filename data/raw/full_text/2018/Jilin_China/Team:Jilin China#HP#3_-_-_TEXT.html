HP Details
Seeing the potential use in the temperature-target drug delivery, we seemed to find an output that fit the public focus and needs. We want to understand the process of medical transformation, at the research level and the market level. We interviewed Prof. Dai Yun from Institute of Translational Medicine in Jilin University for more suggestions and Prof. Jiang Chunlai from Changchun BCHT Biotechnology Company while visiting the manufacture shop.
At research level, we consulted Prof. Dai to understand basic biology research achievement transformation in medical field.
It takes a long time from medical research to practical application. Technology is solid foundation, supporting further clinical trial. Only then, a medical technology could really transform under the supervision of the Health Planning Commission.
Besides, Prof. Dai gave us an example of CRISPR as a gene editing tool in medical research.
Start with a tool, a developed tool powerful and stable enough to popularize in various fields.
As an instance, Prof. Jiang told us a story about the Chickenpox Vaccine, a successful BCHT’s marketing product. A decade was taken from the technology importation to clinical trial. Besides, Prof. Jiang provided us some reasonable advice about our project.
Compared to research institutes, enterprises attach more importance to market and risk, especially in medical field.
Regardless of fields, the users’ requirement is a crucial issue to be count, if you want your research orient market.
Moreover, after we talked about our SynRT toolkit, Prof. Jiang told us that in pharmacy, temperature is truly a crucial factor to control, especially in medicine synthesis. As you can see, in most of manufacture shop, the temperature is controlled strictly to be lower than 22°C.
And for some types medicine, the rate of synthesis may slow down when temperature increases.
Deeply inspired, we realized that the very first focus should not be taken on finding such outputs, but develop our thermosensors as a powerful tool, which contains heat-repressible thermosensors (SynRT 2.0) .
After we built up Toolkit 2.0, we also decided to design cold-repressible thermosensors and cold-inducible thermosensors, we called them as SynRT Toolkit 3.0 . A tool kit of our collection was perfect then.
From 1.0 to 3.0
Highlighting user-oriented quality, we think the direct user of our toolkit is the researchers. They could give evaluation and expand its application. We invited some Ph.D students and professors( potential users) to evaluate our toolkit.
According to their appraisal, we convinced our tool kit design is a good option. Later, if we want to commercialize our tool kits for a convenient use, we are supposed to design a vector .
