The Collection of
SynRT
with Different Sensing Temperatures
ABSTRACT
Many strategies could be used to regulate the gene expression responding to temperature changes in bacterial cells. A well-known class of biological thermoregulatory elements includes RNA-based thermosensors (RTs), which are located in the 5'-   untranslated region in mRNA. RTs could sense temperature shift and influence the mRNA stability or ribosome accessibility, thereby controlling translation efficiency.
However, natural RNA-based thermosensors have complex structure and narrow sensing temperature range, which become the biggest limitation in their application. To address this issue, we have created a synthetic RNA-based thermosensor (SynRT) toolkit with different sensing temperatures. Additionally, we built a matched search engine for users.
The SynRT toolkit version has been updated from 1.0 to 3.0, and the latest version is composed of four types of SynRTs:
SD Sequence
anti-SD Sequence
Ribosome
Heat-inducible RNA-based Thermosensor
RC
anti-RC
RNAse E
Heat-repressible RNA-based Thermosensor
Cold-inducible RNA-based Thermosensor
