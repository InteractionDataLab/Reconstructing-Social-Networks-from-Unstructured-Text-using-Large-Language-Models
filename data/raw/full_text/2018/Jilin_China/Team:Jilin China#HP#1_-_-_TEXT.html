HP Details
Hoping to know who our potential users are, we did some research and consulted relevant teachers about how temperature regulation is applied in industry and manufacture.
Here, according to our research, a form illustrating production and required temperature is shown.
On the basis of the first batch of statistics: RNA-based thermosensors response to temperature at around 37-42°C, our thermosensors may fit to need of yogurt production. Then we visited the Ground Dairy Industry Co.,Ltd, the biggest local diary products supplier in Changchun.
After visiting the manufacturing shop and interviewing the technical staff, we realized the sensing section of RNA thermosensors we set before is quite fit to the product requirement. However, they’re not quite satisfied with the intensity and sensitivity of our thermosensors. Then we decided to make continuous intensity intervals and sensitivity for users. With the help of Model team, our toolkit was improved into SynRT toolkit 1.0 including thermosensors with different melting temperature, relative intensity and sensitivity.
Bonus Track
Our initial idea of this tour is to find an output of our toolkit, and we did find out that our kit could be useful in future fermentation process. However, to our surprise, the technicist there also told us, ‘ If you can lower down the temperature of initial fermentation, it would bring huge economic profits.’ From this point of view, we believed that our toolkit can realize the energy conservation.
The total energy consumption during yogurt fermentation was got from Ground. We modeled the energy conservation when the temperature of initial fermentation was lower down. The data has shown below.
