We used 3 heat baths: 1 with 80°, 1 with 65°, 1 with 37°
For heat shock: increased temperature of the 37° bath to 42°
RIM-Medium for plant cultivating
„Murashige” + Skoog Medium including Vitamins and MES Buffer (concentration: 4.9 g/L)
Adding Saccharose
2 % (w/v) 2 g/100 mL = 20 g/L
Adding Agar Type M
0.7 – 0.8 % (w/v) 0.7 – 0.8 g/100 mL = 7 – 8                  g/L
Adjust pH of the medium with help of KOH (Kaliumhydroxide)
pH 5.7 – 5.8
Autoclaving of this liquid for 10 minutes for sterilizing
Cool down of autoclaved medium (ca. 50 – 55 °C)
Preparing IES stock solution
1mg IES / 1 mL Ethanol scale and then                  storing at 4 °C
For 500 mL medium 500 µl IES Stocklösung sterile in medium pipette
for                  1 L medium put 1 mL stock                  solution in medium
SOC-Medium
We used NEB SOC-Medium and prepared it according to manufacturer’s instructions
LB-Medium (1L liquid)
10 g tryptone
10 g NaCl
5 g yeat extract
Water
(in case we needed chloramphenicol-medium, we used 50 µl for 50 ml medium)
LB-Medium (solid, 1L = 50 dishes)
15 g agar agar
10 g tryptone
10 g NaCl
5 g yeat extract
Water
(in case we needed chloramphenicol-medium, we used 50 µl for 50 ml medium)
Gel-electrophorasis protocol
Pour 1x TAE buffer in electrophoresis chamber, until the agarosegel is covered by approximately 5mm.
Remove agarosegel pocket spacer
Add 12 µl of marker into a pocket
Close electrophoresis chamber and connect to power supply.
Set power supply to 100V, after 5 minutes set voltage to 200V. Run electrophoresis until the marker is                  approximately 1cm from the bottom of the gel (approximately 30 min)
Swich off power supply, remove gel and stain it with staining solution (Sybr Safe). Afterwards wash gel and                  analyse bars.
Agarose
Agarose
TAE 50x - Buffer
ddH20
Prepare 30 mL of 2% Agarose solution. To do so calculate Agarose concentration by (w/v) and weight the                  Agarose.
Add 7 mL of 50x TAE buffer into a new flask and fill with ddH2O to 350mL.
Seal flask with Parafilm and mix. TAE buffer is now 1x TAE buffer.
Place gel pad into electrophoresis chamber and place and add gel barriers into chamber. Afterwards place                  pocket spacer into gel pad.
Add 30mL of 1x TAE buffer to Agarose and mix.
Heat Agarose & 1x TAE buffer solution in microwave until solution is clear
Pour Solution into electrophoresis chamber consistently
Let gel cool for 20 min
Transformation via heat shock
Thaw 200 μL chemocompetent E. Coli cells on ice
Add 0.5-5 μL plasmid to 200 μL chemocompetent ells
Store cells on ice for 10-30 min
Heatshock for 90 s at 42°C
Transfer transformation reaction to 1mL SOC-Medium and incubate 1 h at 37°C
Centrifuge 30 s at 11000 rpm and plate on selective LB-Medium
Incubate overnight at 37°C
