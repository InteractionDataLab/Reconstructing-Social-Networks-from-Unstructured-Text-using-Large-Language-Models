Teamwork
To create an efficient and pleasant working atmosphere and group dynamic, we arrange excursions for the entire team. From strolling through the botanic garden in Münster to visiting the iGEM team from Bielefeld to meeting in a pub to comming to know each other better, we try to keep it entertaining and varied.
