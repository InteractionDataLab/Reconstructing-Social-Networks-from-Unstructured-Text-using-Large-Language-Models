Furthermore, I hope to gain a lot of practical experience in the lab.  Boston's long and fascinating history and the beautiful location on the east coast intrigues me. I'd like to visit the Boston Harbor, too, and I'm looking forward to experiencing the city's atmosphere. </P></DIV><DIV class="column third_size"><DIV class="highlight decoration_A_top"><H2>Facts about Celina</H2><P> 23 years old*  (*by the time of the Giant Jamboree)</P><P><B>Fun Fact: </B> Don't tell my lab mates, but I actually like cleaning up lab spaces. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="column third_size"><H2> Katharina Gorzawski </H2><P> Team: IT

Moreover, my current job has nothing to do with biology or genetics so I kind of missed the lab.</P><P>Due to the fact that I never visited the USA I'm thrilled about everything. I'm mostly curious about the way people are living around the globe and how it differentiates from our own day to day lifes. Of course I want to see some attractions, too, and I'm excited to meet all of the other iGEM teams. </P></DIV><DIV class="column third_size"><DIV class="highlight decoration_A_top"><H2>Facts about Enya</H2><P> 23 years old*  (*by the time of the Giant Jamboree)</P><P><B>Fun Fact: </B>Allergies love me.

   Studies: Biomedical Engineering - 7th semester </P><P> During Amyra's &quot;recruiting&quot; presentation I figured it'd be a nice activity to join the HSHL iGEM team. Since no student of our University competed at iGEM before I thought it implicates a great opportunity to participate actively in a self-developed project. We're facing a lot of e.g. projectmanagement issues that we need to solve ourselves and in my opinion that's the best way to learn problem-solving.</P></DIV><DIV class="column third_size"><DIV class="highlight decoration_A_top"><H2>Facts about Marius </H2><P> 22 years old*  (*by the time of the Giant Jamboree)</P><P><B>Fun Fact: </B>I am forgetful which is why Antonia has to fill out this profil for me.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="column third_size"><H2> B.
