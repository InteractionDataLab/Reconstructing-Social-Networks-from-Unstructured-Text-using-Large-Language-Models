Software Application
This year’s team produced a website application to facilitate the Safety Case ideas explained in last year’s safety page. This application allows synthetic biologists a structured way to organize ideas about the safety or function of a biological system. The home page of the application explains to the user what a safety case is and how to construct one from the individual elements. These elements include, goals, Strategies, Justifications, Assumptions and solutions. On the account page, a user can register and log in to the site.
Any iGEM team can make their own Safety Case by going to unl-igem-test.netlify.com and easily creating an account by providing an email address and password. The first step is to create a root goal, the safety level the user has set to achieve. The next step is to add nodal units to support or lead to your root goal. A root goal can be broken up into smaller goals by adding a Strategy unit. This Strategy unit gives direction to how the root goal should be accomplished. Justification or Assumption units, as the names imply, can be used to describe the reasoning for a given strategy. A Context unit adds clarification to any node preceding it. To bring closure to a sub-goal, the user can add the Solutions unit or the temporary Insufficient unit. All these units are modular, and the user can add goals, strategies, assumptions, and justifications in any order they so choose. Context, insufficiency, and solutions are dead end nodes, but are important to add to an iGEM Safety Case.
