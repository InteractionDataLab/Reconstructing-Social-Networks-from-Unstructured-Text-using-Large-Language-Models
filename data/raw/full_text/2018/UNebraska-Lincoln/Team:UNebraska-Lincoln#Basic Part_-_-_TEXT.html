7-Epi-Sesquithujene Synthase (BBa_K2662002)
7-epi-sesquithujene synthase is the only original part involved in this research. This codon optimized variant of the Zea Mays TPS4-B73 gene, is responsible for conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to a myriad of different sesquiterpenes, the most notable being 7-epi-sesquithujene. This enzyme catalyzes both a 6,7 hydride shift along with 6,1 and 2,6 ring-closures via a magnesium cofactor with ultimately resulting in the the desired product 7-epi-sesquithujene. More information about the uses of this enzyme can be found HERE .
