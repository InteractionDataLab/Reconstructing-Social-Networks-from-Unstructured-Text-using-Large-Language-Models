Advisors:
Colton Harper
Colton is a junior pursuing a B.S. degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. He plans to attend graduate school and then secure a position in academia. His research interests are in molecular communication, information theory, and synthetic biology. Colton’s favorite onomatopoeia is “Whoup-a chyah”.
Professors:
Wei Niu
Dr. Wei Niu is a Synthetic Biologist and an Assistant Professor in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Her research focuses on the metabolic engineering principles that are used for biological microbial-synthesis of industrial additive chemicals from sustainable feedstocks, which also entails the development of enzymes and auxiliary proteins that are used to develop pharmaceutical and other energy-applied molecules.
Jiantao Guo
Dr. Guo received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Organic Chemistry from Nankai University with Professor Jin-Pei Cheng, and his Ph.D. degree from Michigan State University with Professor John W. Frost. He pursued postdoctoral studies with Professor Peter G. Schultz at The Scripps Research Institute before joining the University of Nebraska – Lincoln, Department of Chemistry as an Assistant Professor in 2010.
Myra Cohen
Myra Cohen is a Professor in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  She is a member of the ESQuaReD software engineering research group.  She received her Ph.D. from the University of Auckland, New Zealand and her M.S. from the University of Vermont.  She is the recipient of both a National Science Foundation Early CAREER award and an Air Force Office of Scientific Research Young Investigator Award. Her research interests are in software testing of configurable systems, search-based software engineering and applications of software testing techniques to biological systems engineering.
Massimiliano Pierobon
Massimiliano Pierobon is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Dr. Pierobon holds also a courtesy appointment at the Department of Biochemistry, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, effective from September 2014. Dr. Pierobon received the Master of Science (B.S.+M.S.) degree in Telecommunication Engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2005.
