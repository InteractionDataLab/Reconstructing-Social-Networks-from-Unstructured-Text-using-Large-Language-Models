InterLab
As part of the iGEM competition, the MIT team conducted experiments for the InterLab study.  We first reconstituted the DNA for each of the required parts and transformed DH5 alpha with these constructs. We had difficulty creating and using the competent DH5 alpha cells, which delayed the process. Next, we picked overnight cultures from the plates of transformed bacteria. While the cultures grew, we created the plates for the calibration of the machine and filled out the preliminary information. On the following day, we removed and diluted samples from the colonies to put in the plate reader, and then prepared them for and ran them through the flow cytometer.  We let the remaining cultures grow for another six hours, and then repeated the process. See our data below:
Raw Plate Reader Data
This is the data we collected for each plate on the plate reader, with the Abs600 in the right tables and the Fluorescence in the left.  The plates were set up as dictated in the documentation and these were the results we saw.
Fluorescence per OD Data
This is the Fluorescence data normalized by the OD readings, using functions provided by the InterLab study.  The first table is the ratio of the fluorescence to the optical density, the second is the net fluorescein and the third is the Net Abs 600.
Fluorescence per Particle Data
This is the Fluorescence per particle, created using functions given by the InterLab study.  The first table is the fluorescence per particle, the second is the net Fluoroscein and the third is the net Abs 600.
Without access to the data from other teams, we cannot be sure if this aligns with what others measured and thus proved the goal of the InterLab study. However, we are confident in our data and are proud to have contributed to experimental standardization.
