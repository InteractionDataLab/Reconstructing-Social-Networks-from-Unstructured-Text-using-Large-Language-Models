Binding
Our engineered yeast adheres to the membrane protein Syndecan1 on the cancer cell surface. To do so, a protein complex is introduced consisting of Histone Like Protein A (HlpA), which specifically binds to Syndecan1, a linker, and the yeast cell surface display protein Aga2.
Detection
S. boulardii produces ultrasound-detectable gas vesicles, a mixed gene-set from prokaryotic gas vesicle operons. To allow single transcript expression in a eukaryote, 2A viral peptide sequences that cleave themselves are introduced between the genes.
Treatment
Myrosinase is introduced into S. boulardii, it is an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of glucosinolate (present in cruciferous vegetables) to the chemopreventive sulphoraphane. Its expression is coupled to an engineered pheromone sensing system to limit its production to yeast accumulating around tumors.
