This project was not only a group effort but has also been made possible by many people supporting us. We want to thank those who helped us realize this project, those who advised us and kept our spirits up even when things seemed to go in the wrong direction. Thank you for your valuable scientific advice, thank you for your time and for making us grow as researchers. Thank you for believing in us every single moment and for making us part of a scientific community and thank you, above all, for giving us this immense opportunity.
In particular, we want to thank:
Our supervisors:
Verena Siewers, project leader at the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering in the Systems and Synthetic Biology Group at Chalmers and teacher of the course Synthetic Biology that some of us followed.
Ivan Mijakovic, Director of the Chalmers Life Science Engineering Area of Advance and Professor at the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering.
Raphael Ferreira and Linnea Österberg, PhD students at Chalmers University.
The authors of the papers that inspired us: Ho C, Tan H, Chua K et al. (Engineered commensal microbes for diet-mediated colorectal-cancer chemoprevention, 2018) and Bourdeau RW et al. (Acoustic reporter genes for noninvasive imaging of microorganisms in mammalian hosts, 2018).
Everyone that helped us in the lab, in particular to Raphael, who dedicated all his time to us, Linnea Österberg, Oliver Konzock, Doris Zoric, Angelo Limeta and Alex Hedin with their precious advice.
Jonathan Robinson, Benjamín Sánchez Barja and Eduard Kerkhoven who gave us precious feedback and advice about our modeling.
Carl Johan Franzén, Mef Nilbert and Karl de Fine Licht for the interviews.
The Systems and Synthetic Biology department and the Systems Biology group at the department of Mathematical sciences for giving us the opportunity to present our project and give us critical comments and feedback about the project.
Göteborgs-Posten and Marco Giavelli for the article dedicated to us and our project.
Laboratory for experimental biomedicines EBM (Gothenburg University) for letting us use the ultrasound equipment.
Mike Vega, Vice-president, Business development and sales VERASONIC who gave us feedback about ultrasound equipment and possibilities.
Lisbeth Olsson, head of Industrial Biotechnology at Chalmers University of Technology and Jens Nielsen, head of Systems and Synthetic Biology at Chalmers University of Technology for letting us use the department’s equipment and facilities. Prof. Lisbeth Olsson also provided us with an office during the summer.
Mirko Ciesco for his web design advices.
Our photoghraphers:
Daniela Berutti for the Gothenburg picture
Margherita Botta for the team pictures
All of this support would have been in vain if not for our hard-working team. Thank you all for dedicating all of our time to this fantastic journey since February. In particular, we would like to thank:
FUNDING: Axel and Philip searched for, called, and emailed many companies to present our project and recruit them as sponsors.
MODELING: Amanda, Francisco, Philip and Andrea that modeled our project since June.
GENOME SCALE METABOLIC MODELING: Francisco and Philip
KINETIC MODELING: Amanda
WIKI: Jacob and Cecilia who designed and coded our wiki since June.
HUMAN PRACTICES: Agnes, Amanda, Andrea, Jacob, Cecilia and Axel that reached out and worked on the human practices since May.
PLASMID AND PRIMERS DESIGN: Andrea, Philip, and Agnes that designed our plasmids and primers during April and May.
INTERLAB: Amanda, Francisco, and Jacob who worked on the interlab in June.
SOCIAL MEDIA: Cecilia and Agnes, who managed our social media accounts and kept people updated about our work.
TEAM LEADERS: Cecilia and Philip, who as team leaders organized, planned and coordinated the team and the work during these eight months.
BIOBRICKS: Axel and Cecilia who dedicated the last month to build the BioBricks and Andrea and Agnes who help them design the BioBricks.
LABWORK: Finally, we would like to thank all our team members for working in the lab during the summer months until October, in particular:
ANCHOR PROTEIN: Andrea and Cecilia
GAS VESICLES: Philip, Amanda and Jacob
TARGET MOLECULE: Agnes and Axel
