Agnes Torell
Hello!                   My name is Agnes and I am born and raised here in Gothenburg.                   I am right now taking my last year of my masters in biotechnology here at Chalmers university of technology where my focus is tissue engineering.                    When I’m not studying I have a lot of things going on. I have found the love for scuba diving and I try to do that as often as possible.                    I also spend a lot of time working out, and I teach a couple of classes at a gym nearby.                    When I don’t do that I love spending time with friends, eat food, travel, try new things, yeah you know as the usual!                   PS I have loved working with iGEM this summer and spending time with my fantastic Gothenburg team! You rock guys!                   Thanks for your attention!
Amanda Olmin
Hello, I'm Amanda. I grew up on the Swedish east coast and moved to Gothenburg to study biotechnology at Chalmers.                    During my studies I've come to the conclusion that I prefer mathematics and programming over wet lab.                    That's the reason why I'm following a master's program focused on modelling and systems science.                    In my spare time I like to hang out with friends and spend time in nature.
Andrea Clausen Lind
Hi everyone, my name is Andrea.                   I just completed my bachelor in Biotechnology at Chalmers University of Technology and will continue with a master in the same track.                    The first half year of the master will be an exchange at TU Delft, and then I will return to Chalmers for the rest.                   I enjoy spending time with people, going to the gym, experiencing different foods and travelling to different cultures.                    My favorite hobby is to laugh at bad jokes, and also to watch videos of the bird named Albert on youtube.
Axel Norberg
Hey there, im Axel. Im born and raised here in gothenburg and Im a masters student at chalmers.                    Im currently enrolled in the Biotechnology programme with a focus on tissue engineering.                    My areas of intrest are mainly 3D bioprinting and wound healing.                    I only have one single intrest outside of my school work and that is annihilating Francisco at ping pong.
Cecilia Trivellin
Hi, I'm Cecilia!                   I'm Italian, but my village is located really close to France which might explain why I eat more croissants than pizza!                   I graduated in chemical engineering at Politecnico di Torino and now I'm studying Biotechnology at Chalmers!                   I have been dancing for about 13 years and I love to climb and ski.                    I would like to have a goat as a pet and a bay window where I can sit down and read (even if I start million books without finishing one).
Francisco Zorrilla
Oh hi, didn't see you there. My name is Francisco and I am an Italo-Argentine Master's student at Chalmers.                    I obtained my bachelor's degree in Biosystems Engineering at the University of California Davis, after which I moved to Gothenburg to continue my education in Biotechnology.                    My research interests include Genome Scale Modeling and Bioinformatic analysis of the gut microbiome.                    When I am not working hard in the office, I enjoy playing the guitar, grabbing a drink with friends, and destroying Axel at ping pong.
Jacob Sjölin
Hi, I'm Jacob.                   I'm born and raised in Gothenburg, and it's also here that I've chosen to study.                   It was here at Chalmers University of technology that I finished my bachelor in biotech,                   and it's here that I've chosen to continue my studies, having just finished my first year of the biotech masters with a focus on tissue engineering.                   When I'm not studying I tend to relax by reading a book, go for a run, or spend time with friends,                    be it through an online game, rolling dice while playing DnD, or just hanging out at a bar.
Philip Gorter de Vries
Hey, I am Philip.                   I am a Dutch student who grew up in Lyon, France.                    After finishing my bachelor’s in Biotechnology at Wageningen University in the Netherlands,                    I moved to Sweden to start a master’s in the same study field with a systems biology focus.                    When I am not studying or working on iGEM, I like to go out hiking, climbing or sailing and I am always in for a refreshing drink as a reward for a long day.
