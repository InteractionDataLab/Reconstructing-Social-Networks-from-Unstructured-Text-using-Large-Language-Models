Safety
Safety Introduction of Department
Before being granted access to the laboratory, every team member received a day long laboratory introduction including a lecture, a tour of the lab and an introduction to the safety rules and guidelines established in our laboratory. These are determined by both European (European Directive 2009/41/EC) and Swedish (Swedish regulation AFS 2005:1, in Swedish) regulation. Additional safety guidelines covering general safety instructions, accident risk identification and appropriate responses in case of an accident are set by the department of Biology and Biotechnology of Chalmers. Three laboratory engineers responsible for the safety in our department, as well as our supervisors have certified our competences allowing us to work in the lab.
Risk Assessment
Additionally to this safety training, we have carefully identified the risks related to our iGEM project and summarised these in a risk assessment document. This document presents an overview of all the equipment and chemicals necessary for the project, the risks that are involved in their use and how to minimise these. In order to involve every team-member and to ensure that everyone is aware of its content, we have split up our team and written two distinct risk assessments independently. Only after both of these risk assessments were approved we could start working in the laboratory.
Herewith both written risk assessments:
Risk assessment of group 1
Risk assessment of group 2
