A worldwide issue
In 2015, 8.8 million people died of cancer worldwide. Of these deaths, about 9% were caused by colorectal cancer, making colorectal cancer the third most lethal type of cancer.
The problem
Our project
Using yeast to combat cancer
Our project aims to diagnose and treat colorectal cancer through the use of genetically engineered probiotic yeast.
Turning our project into math
By modeling our project we are able to predict key parts of our project such as the production and efficiency of our anti-cancer agent or how the yeast interacts with the surrounding environment. These outcomes can then be used to improve our project design.
Modeling
Human practices
Our project's role in society
Another important part is to integrate our project into society, not only by ensuring a safe and reliable product, but also by reaching out to professionals and to the public to inform them about our project and to collect their opinions.
