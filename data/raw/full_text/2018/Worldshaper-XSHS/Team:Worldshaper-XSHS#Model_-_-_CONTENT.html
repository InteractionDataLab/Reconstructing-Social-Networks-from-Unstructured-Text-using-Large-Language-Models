Built on the pSB1C3 backbone, the first generation system contains a nicA2 promoter and a GFP gene, while the second one adds a T7 RNA polymerase gene and a T7 promoter in the middle of the first generation design to enhance the expression of the fluorescence. Via experiments, we learnt that the activity of the nicA2 promoter is regulated by the concentration of nicotine, so we applied different concentrations to both generations of systems for testing, and used the results to build the following math models using MATLAB (R2018b).</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="xshs-box3"><P style="width: 800px;margin-left: 11px;margin-top: -23px;font-size: 22px;margin-bottom: 20px;" id="Ourteam">Ⅰ.

                           (3) When the concentration of nicotine is equal to 0. 1 g/L, the fluorescence intensities detected at several time points are substantially lower than those of the blank control, and are shown as negative numerically. We conjecture that at the concentration of 0.1 g/L, nicotine has significant toxicity to the strain, which may have caused a large number of damage to the bacteria or even death, resulting in a decrease in the fluorescence value. A peak of fluorescence expression appears at 4h, probably because the strongest induction effect of nicotine is shown at that time, offsetting some of the variation in fluorescence intensity caused by bacterial damage. The fitted function is:

                            (6) Conclusion: Nicotine exhibits two properties for the strain. On the one hand, it can activate the promoter and induce the expression of fluorescence; on the other, nicotine has a toxic effect on the bacteria. Under the combined effect of these two properties, our detection system detected a great variety of fluorescence intensities. Based on the above models, we analyzed that the inhibition effect is not significant when the concentration of nicotine is less than 0.03g/L, and the fluorescence intensity increases with time. When the concentration is greater than 0.3 g/L, the inhibition effect is significant. And if the concentration is too high, the inhibitory effect of nicotine on bacteria will be overwhelming, resulting in a significant decrease in fluorescence expression.

                            To better explore the relationship between nicotine concentrations and bacterial growth, we prepared 10 different concentrations of nicotine solutions for testing, i.e. 0.02 g/L, 0.04 g/L, 0.08 g/L, 0.16 g/L, 0.32 g/L, 0.64 g/L, 1.28 g/L, 2.56 g/L, 5.12 g/L and 10.24g/ L. During the data analysis, we performed the following substitution of the concentration:
                        </P></DIV><DIV class="xshs-box3"><P class="itemstyle" style="margin-left: 195px">
                           in order to better discover its relationship with OD600. For the X-axis, 1, 2, 3 until 10 respectively represent the 10 different concentrations of nicotine, i.e. 0.02 g/L, 0.04 g/L, 0.08 g/L, 0.16 g/L, 0.32 g/L, 0.64 g/L, 1.28 g/L, 2.56 g/L, 5.12 g/L and 10.24g/L. We can see that the OD values at 0h in different groups are all 0.05, which means that all the groups share the same starting point. At 2h, the OD values detected at various concentration groups are basically the same, and have not increased much since 0h. At 4h, the OD values of the low concentration groups increased significantly. And for the groups larger than 5 (that is, 0.32 g/L), there is a downward trend, that is, the toxicity of nicotine has begun to manifest. The critical value, the concentration of 0.32 g/L, is basically consistent with our conjecture based on the models in the first part. As time goes on, the toxicity of nicotine becomes more and more significant. At 12h, when the concentrations are greater than 0.32 g/L, the number of bacteria decreases significantly. And as the concentration increases, the inhibiting effect also increases. Based on this model, we speculate that the effect of nicotine on bacterial growth is related to time and nicotine concentration. When the exposure time is less than 4 hours and the concentration is lower than 0.32 g/L, the inhibition is not significant. While with the increase of time and nicotine concentration, its inhibitory effect gradually increases.

                           Based on the structure of plasmids, we predict that the sensitivity of the second generation detection system should be higher than that of the first generation. In order to better test their sensitivities, we have chosen a very low nicotine concentration that can still induce fluorescence to do the experiment. The concentration is 0.0001 g/L. By analyzing the experiment data, we get the following models:
                        </P></DIV><DIV class="xshs-box3"><P class="itemstyle" style="margin-left: 330px">
                          We can see that the detected fluorescence of the second generation detection system is higher than the first generation detection system. The difference is most significant at 3h. However, the fluorescence intensity detected by the second-generation system was significantly decreased at 4h. We conjecture that this may be related to the toxic effect of nicotine on the bacteria. Although the first generation of detection system can detect fluorescence, it is not as sensitive as the second generation system.

                          In conclusion, we should choose the second generation detection system to detect the nicotine concentration and the best detection time is at 3h. However, if the first generation system is selected, the detection is better done after 4 hours, with the optimal detection concentration of less than 0.32 g/L.
