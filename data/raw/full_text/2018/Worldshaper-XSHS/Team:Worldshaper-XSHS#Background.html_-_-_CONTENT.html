December 29, 2013, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has required leading cadres at all levels to abide by the smoking ban regulations in public places and to set an example with practical actions.

                        </P><P class="itemstyle">           Compared with the United States and China, there is a very strange phenomenon: about 85% of American women with lung cancer are smokers, while in China, more than 80% of female lung cancer patients never smoke![4]
                            In addition to smoking, what other external factors can cause lung cancer? In fact, the most easy to think of is secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke is a clear carcinogen. China is the country with the worst problem of secondhand smoke in the world!
                            Active smoking and “secondhand smoke” are the main reasons for the rapid growth of lung cancer in women.
                            More than a dozen studies have confirmed that exposure to secondhand smoke is associated with lung cancer, and non-smoking women who marry smoking husbands have a higher risk of lung cancer. More than 700 million women and children in China, at home and in public places, are long-term victims of second-hand smoke.
                            From this, we thought that perhaps we can use the knowledge of synthetic biology to contribute to the reduction of second-hand smoke.

                        </P><P class="itemstyle">
                            Nicotine, alias nicotine, is a natural alkaloid. It is widely found in eggplant plants and is an important component of tobacco plants. 【1】 Nicotine is found in the leaves of Nicotiana rustica, in concentrations of 2–14%; in the tobacco plant, Nicotiana tabacum; in Duboisia hopwoodii; and in Asclepias syriaca. 【2】The chemical name for nicotine is 1-methyl2-3-(pyridine) -tetrahydropyrrolidine, and whose molecular formula isＣ10Ｈ14Ｎ2 with molecular weight of 162.23 g / mol. Alongside strong volatility, special spicy and deliquescent, purified nicotine is colorless or yellowish transparent oily liquid at room temperature. And it is easily to be oxidized to the appearance of dark gray in sunshine【15】. The density is 1.0097g / ml at 20 ℃ and the boiling point is 274.5 ℃ at 760mmHg. Nicotine is weak alkaline, when temperature is below 60 ℃, it can dissolve with water in any proportion, and it is easy to dissolve in alcohol, ether, gas imitating and so on. It is also a natural chiral compound with optical rotation and two optical isomers of (S) and (R). Nicotine in nature is mainly (S)-type.
                        </P><P class="itemstyle">
                            Beyond addiction, both short and long-term nicotine exposure have not been established as dangerous to adults, 【9】 except among certain vulnerable groups. 【10】 Nicotine is linked to possible birth defects. 【13】 During pregnancy, there are risks to the child later in life for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral defects, respiratory dysfunction, and infertility. 【12】Nicotine in the form of nicotine replacement products poses less of a cancer risk than smoking. 【11】 The use of electronic cigarettes, which are designed to be refilled with nicotine-containing e-liquid, has raised concerns over nicotine overdoses, especially with regard to the possibility of young children ingesting the liquids. 【14】At sufficiently high doses, nicotine is associated with poisonings and is potentially lethal. 【7、11】 Nicotine as a tool for quitting smoking has a good safety history. 【12】 There is inadequate research to show that nicotine itself is associated with cancer in humans.【11】However, it has been reported that nicotine is nitrided during smoking. The production of N- nitrosamine (TSNA), which is unique to tobacco, can lead to lung cancer, (Davis et al., 2003), posing a serious threat to human health. 
                        </P><P class="itemstyle">
                            In addition to active smoking, passive smoking is also an important channel for nicotine to enter the human body. Secondhand smoke or even three-handed smoke is a threat that cannot be ignored in the environment. 【16、17、18、19】According to statistics, about 740 million people are also affected by second-hand smoke. 【36】

                           Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which mainly acts on nicotine in the central nervous system. 【20】In addition to nicotine itself, NNK ([4- (methylnitrosamino)-1- (3-pyridyl) -1-butanone] ) and NNN (N'-nitrosonor nicotine), two specific metabolites of nicotine in organisms, also bind to nAChR, which is the main cause of addiction to smoking. 【21】The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, when stimulated, exhibit adverse effects in many types of tissues, such as epidermal / oral keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and many types of cells in the digestive system, Lung immune system, etc. 【22】Long-term nicotine exposure is therefore highly likely to increase the risk of cancer, especially lung cancer. 【17、23、24】Studies by Hawkins et al. have shown that nicotine can easily penetrate most biofilms, including blood-brain barriers, and its effects on animals and humans are mainly manifested as increased pulse, increased blood pressure, and increased free fatty acids on cell membranes, activation of blood glucose and increase of catechin in blood. 【25、26】 Heeschen et al. Suggest that moderate smoking can lead to increased plasma concentrations in blood vessels, accompanied by an increase in the incidence of many diseases such as cardiovascular disease, macular disease and rheumatoid arthritis. 【27】Based on children epidemiological studies of overweight and obese mothers smoking during pregnancy and exposure to embryonic development in laboratory animals, Oken et al. suggest that smoking can lead to obesity. 【28】

                            There are ten thousand tons of tobacco-leave waste in China every year, and the nicotine content of the waste is as high as 18tg/kg (dry weight), which is 36 times higher than the European Union's &quot;toxic and hazardous waste&quot; control standard, which will pose a serious threat to the safety of groundwater in our country. 【29】In recent years, the production and extensive use of new nicotine pesticides have become another important source of nicotine pollution in the environment. This kind of pesticide, which is represented by Imidacloprid, has been widely used in the prevention and control of fruit trees and vegetable pests because of its novel way of action, strong toxicity, high efficiency, broad spectrum, contact and stomach toxicity and so on. 【30、31】 At present, the widely used nicotinic insecticides in the world are imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, thiacloprid, dinotefuran, acetamiprid, nitenpyram and so on.【32、33】Although tobacco reducing pesticide has many advantages in low toxicity and high efficiency, it has toxic side effects on non-dry target freshwater insects and crustaceans. 【34】The aquatic ecological safety of this kind of pesticide is worthy of attention. 【35】

Nicotine plays a direct role in carcinogenesis through a variety of mechanisms, including increasing the activity of tumor growth-promoting transcription factors, decreasing apoptosis, and increasing angiogenesis in tumors. Additionally, specific types of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors— eg, alpha 7 receptors, which are stimulated by nicotine—are found in many malignant tumors and are thought to play a role in tumor progression.12 Blockade of alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors has been shown to decrease the growth of certain cancers. However, these findings were from in vitro studies, and the concerns they raised have not been reflected in in vivo studies. Despite having been on the market for 30 years, nicotine replacement therapy has as yet not been associated with any “real world” increase in cancer risk
