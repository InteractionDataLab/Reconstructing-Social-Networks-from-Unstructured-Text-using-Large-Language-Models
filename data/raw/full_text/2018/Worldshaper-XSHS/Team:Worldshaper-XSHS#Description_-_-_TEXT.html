Project Description
Biodetection and Biodegrading of Nicotine
Tobacco consumption is one of the leading preventable causes of death and disease in the world. Nicotine, a major toxic component of tobacco, can cross biological membranes and the blood-brain barrier easily. During cigarette manufacturing, large quantities of tobacco waste with high concentrations of nicotine are produced, and the disposal of these wastes is a serious ecological problem. Microbial organisms play important roles in the tobacco manufacturing process by altering the content of nicotine. Some strains of Pseudomonas exhibits high nicotine-degrading activity, which has a gene cluster encoded enzymes involved in the catabolism of nicotine.
In this study, we are trying to use synthetic biological methods to construct Escherichia coli strains that can easily detect the concentration of nicotine, and over-express the key enzyme genes for nicotine bioremediation. It may explore a better way to nicotine degradation and detection.
