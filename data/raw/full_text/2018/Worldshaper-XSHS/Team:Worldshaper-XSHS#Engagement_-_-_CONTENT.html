 </P><P>
                            Worldshaper-XSHS introduce iGEM competition to all students and parents who are interested in biology by carrying out lots of activities that not only can ignite students’ enthusiasm on synthetic biology, but also gain parents’ support to our projects about iGEM. The publicity attracted many peers to join the Worldshaper-XSHS. With everyone's effort to set up the EB community, we have found an official club in the Xiaoshan High School. We firmly believe that Worldshaper-XSHS will attract more and more people who desire to devote into the program! The whole team will publicize the 2017 Worldshaper-XSHS research projects (the detection of oxygen and nitrogen and phosphorus content in sewage) so that more students will understand us and support us. At the same time, we also make various assumptions of our major subjects for 2018.

                           On May 19, we went to the Zhejiang Technology Market to participate Technology week in order to advertise the products of synthetic biology. On the one hand, we introduced iGEM and took the research result of last year's Worldshaper-XSHS, which includes synthetic biology. On the other hand, we proposed a project proposal and analyzed the harm of second-hand smoke to our healthy. To further develop our projects, we handed out more than 200 electronic questionnaires to Learn about public attitudes to secondhand smoke. Visitors were also willing to support our activities. The results showed that the majority of respondents were inevitably exposed to the second-hand smoke due to work or family environment. According to the field interview, we knew that most of people are only familiar with disadvantages of second-hand smoking, but they did not understand how it works and how to dispose it. We got very comprehensive feedback from the questionnaire, and our assumption also provided great help to the society. This is the first time that we made a public presentation in the society, which contained great educational value by helping the public to learn synthetic biology. At the same time, we also attained beneficial from it, determining our research topic.

There were many exhibitions in the festival, but our advertisement was the most appealing one. Our team introduced many biological devices to alumni, and prepared many simple experiments like chlorophyll extraction, wall separation observation, cell mitosis observation, and so on. moreover, we've introduced IGEM competition to our alumni and showed our subject—using synthetic biology to detect nicotine. Everyone embraced with strong curiosity, consulting “what the various equipment is”, “what did we use, how to cultivate bacteria in the experiment”, and “how to build plasmid”.  This presentation was held in the celebration of the festival, which was gained wide attention. Not only the alumni learned from our project, but also the students learned a lot about synthetic biology.
