Team
There are 3 PI & Instructors, 2 advisors and 11 undergraduate members consisting of Team NJU_China. Familiar with iGEM competition, this team has its unique experimental style thanks to much experience of past years. All of their members are determined to complete the complex project each year. This time, NJU_China, represented by 16 people with their full scientific enthusiasm and serious scientific attitude, presented a project of how to “Surf in the Neuron”. Here they are.
PI & Instructors
Qipeng Zhang：
His research focuses on the roles of microRNAs in nervous systems. He had identified and characterized the microRNA profiles of mouse forebrain synaptosome and their supernatants before and after depolarization stimulation, he found the synaptosome can secret microRNAs during depolarization and uptake microRNAs via endocytosis pathways. Now, he is interested in the microRNA, mRNA transportation in neurites. As the secondary PI of NJU_China, he designed the experiments and supervised the whole process. With much patience and devotion to the project, he taught us many things. And I believe that is why our project went well.
Xi Chen：
He is an amazing and inspiring teacher. Thanks to his encouragement, we are eager to put forward innovative ideas and voice our own opinions about the ongoing work. Besides, what impresses us most is that he helps us patiently whenever we have trouble with our projects. He offers so much support and help, from the construction of the whole experimental frame to the references we choose.
Yu Zhou：
Fourth-year doctoral student from Advanced Institution for Life Sciences of Nanjing University. He has been participated in iGEM competition since 2013. He is much devoted to the project and team. No matter what problems we encountered, whether they were experimental or iGEM questions, he would help us solve them. There is no doubt that his outstanding leadership ensured everything that needed to be done would get done.
