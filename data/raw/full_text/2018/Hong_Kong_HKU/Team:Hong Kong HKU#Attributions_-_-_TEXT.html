We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all people who supported us throughout the project, for making ETHERNO possible, and bringing us an unforgetable learning experience.
Team PIs
Dr. TANNER, Julian Alexander
Assistant Dean (Biomedical Sciences Curriculum), Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong
Associate Director (Teaching and Learning), School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Hong Kong
HKU iGEM 2018 Primary PI
Advised us on DNA nanostructure project design and provided us invaluable guidance and resources throughout the project. HKU iGEM 2018 would not have been possible without the foundation laid by Dr. Tanner.
Professor WONG, Alice Sze Tsai
Associate Dean, Faculty of Science, The University of Hong Kong
HKU iGEM 2018 Secondary PI
Advised us on cancer cell culture project design and provided us generous amount of MCF-7 cell line culture resources, enabling us to demonstrate our nanostructure's function.
Team Advisors
Mr. SHIU, Simon Chi-Chin - PhD candidate, School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Hong Kong
As a DNA nanotechnology researcher under the tutelage of Dr. Tanner, Simon guided us from nanostructure design to characterization. He helped to acquire the transmission electron microscopic images in this project. He also helped us to develop skills of data analysis and presentation.
Mr. SHUKLA, Yash Sanjaykumar - HKU iGEM 2017 team leader
Shared with us his previous iGEM experience and helped us with troubleshooting.
HKU School of Biomedical Sciences
