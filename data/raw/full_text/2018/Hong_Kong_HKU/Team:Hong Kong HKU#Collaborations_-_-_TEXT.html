- Mentoring HK_HCY_LFC team
This year, HKU team mentored HK_HCY_LFC, a joint team of two secondary schools, Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College (HCY) and Po Leung Kuk Laws Foundation College (PLKLFC). Both schools are new to iGEM. Having alumni from both schools in the HKU iGEM team, the formation of the HK_HCY_LFC team was facilitated.
HK_HCY_LFC team chose to work on DNA nanostructure, an area HKU team was experienced in and was able to provide education and technical support. In early February, students from HKU iGEM team started to educate and brainstorm ideas with HK_HCY_LFC team students.
Training the new iGEMers
Starting from March, HKU team paid weekend visits to equip HK_HCY_LFC with synbio knowledge and skills, so that they would be ready to compete in iGEM using their own ideas.
With the kickstart of laboratory sessions in July, HKU team stepped up supervision on HK_HCY_LFC's experimental design and laboratory work. In day to day laboratory sessions, the HKU iGEM team members visited the school to teach students laboratory techniques, precautions and data analysis skills.
Supporting each other
HKU team helped HK_HCY_LFC with DNA nanostructure design advising, BioBricks cloning, InterLab study and preparation of the final submission plate.
HKU team would like to express our gratitude to HK_HCY_LFC, for helping us organize a part cloning demonstration at their school laboratory and giving us 3 pairs of primers to test the performance of ETHERNO.
