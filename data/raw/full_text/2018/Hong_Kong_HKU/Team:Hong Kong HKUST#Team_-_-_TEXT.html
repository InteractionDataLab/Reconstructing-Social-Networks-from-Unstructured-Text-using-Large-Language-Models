Members
UNNITHAN Vignesh Gopalakrishnan
Chemistry
Year 2
India
Vignesh spent a lot of time in the lab waiting for the Alkane module's PCR, during which he picked up his hobby of sculpting agarose gels.
AU Chun Yin (Samuel)
Mechanical Engineering
Year 2
China (HKSAR)
It doesn't make sense how Sam's so good at biology when his major has no relation whatsoever with biology. The alkane module is blessed to have him. He also devised a working MFC from everyday materials found in the lab!
WAHYU Zoya Estella
Data Science and Technology
Year 2
Indonesia
She is her own role model. That's completely understandable because she can do anything! She helped out with design, modelling, wiki, and our laccase module!
DWI NUGROHO Laurensia Vianna
Biotechnology
Year 2
Indonesia
As an avid instagrammer and amateur illustrator, she is definitely well suited for her position as our design team person-in charge! She also helped with our laccase module.
KONG Deyue (Fiona)
Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Year 3
China (Mainland)
Fiona eats a lot of chocolate! Maybe that's how she became so good at math? She did the modelling for our project and she also worked on our laccase module.
INTAN Angelica Grace
Biotechnology
Year 2
Indonesia
In the lab, Angelica mostly worked on the laccase module, but outside the lab, she can be found either watching dog videos or working for our design team.
WONG Hei Man (Ivy)
Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
Year 4
China (HKSAR)
Ivy contributed a lot to our MFC module and interlab. It's still a mystery how she can come to the lab everyday when she also has final year project going on at the same time.
TAM Cheuk Lam (Nikki)
Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Year 3
China (HKSAR)
A heavy procrastinator, but also a super tech-savvy gal, knows everything from video production to making posters. Nikki is part of our human practices team.
TO Wing Kiu (Sophia)
Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Year 3
China (HKSAR)
Sophia says "MEH" all the time. Maybe that's because she's such a MEHmerizing person. She was the person-in-charge of our human practices team.
CHU Ora In (Kelly)
Biotechnology and Gen Business Mgmt
Year 3
Thailand
Kelly is the person in charge of the laccase module, and in addition to that she is also one of our co-leaders. She likes to think of herself as the boss of the potatoes. Us potatoes sure look up to her!
PANG Chung Him (Tim)
Biotechnology
Year 4
China (HKSAR)
Tim loves his trademark blue windbreaker. So much so that he didn't want to wear our team T-shirt for his wiki photoshoot. In the lab he worked mostly for interlab and our MFC module.
CHENG Log G
Comp Science and Gen Business Mgmt
Year 3
China (HKSAR)
Log G disappears a lot. We barely ever see him in person. He's a low key guy, but his work on our wiki is definitely high key.
CHOI Hon Fung (Kenny)
Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Year 4
China (HKSAR)
Kenny can be found either working hard for our alkane module, or working equally hard in the gym for his six-pack.
LAU Yee Hin (Henry)
Biotechnology and Business
Year 2
China (HKSAR)
Listening to Henry talk will remind you of Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory. Likewise his intelligence! He's one of the co-leaders of our project and he worked mainly in our alkane module.
ALDO Ferdinan
Industrial Engg and Decision Analytics
Year 2
Indonesia
Although he dozes off a lot in the lab, Aldo is our man when it comes to wiki! He also helped out with the interlab.
CHENG Hiu Cheung (Hugo)
Biotechnology
Year 3
China (HKSAR)
Hugo is part of our human practices team. He also practices his british accent a lot.
LEE Ming Yan (Christy)
Biotechnology
Year 3
China (HKSAR)
Christy talks less and does more. This is evident in her contribution to our MFC module and human practices.
SO Kam Pang (Lester)
Mechanical Engg and Gen Business Mgmt
Graduated
China (HKSAR)
Despite being our oldest member, Lester didn't hold back from goofing around with the rest of us. At the same time he also did serious work for our interlab!

Instructor
Name : Dr. Jessica Ce Mun Tang
Dr. Tang has been joining the iGEM team as an instructor for nine years. Prior to joining iGEM, most of the members, especially                             those from life science department, are already familiar with her since their first year as she                             has been the course instructor for General Biology courses. She never puts on airs and has always                             treated us like more than a student of hers. Just like the lyrics, "Let this be our lesson in                             love. Let this be the way we remember us."
Name : Prof. King Lau Chow
He is currently the Director of Interdisciplinary Programs Office. His research work spans a broad spectrum of biological                             sciences, with many different interdisciplinary collaboration. He has been engaged in iGEM activities                             for the past 9 years and sees it a very effective way of vertically integrating education while                             training our critical thinking skills. When we're facing problems, he encourages us to explore                             by ourselves rather than directly telling us the solution.
