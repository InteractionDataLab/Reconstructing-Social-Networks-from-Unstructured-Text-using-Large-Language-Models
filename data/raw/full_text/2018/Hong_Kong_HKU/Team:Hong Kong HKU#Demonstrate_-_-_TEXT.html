Nano Drug Carriers
Nano Drug Carriers and Nano Drug Carrier-AS1411 facilited doxorubicin cell entry visualized under fluorescence microscope .
Nano Drug Carriers and Nano Drug Carrier-AS1411 efficiently released an anti-miRNA DNA oligo in the presence of RNA inputs, as visualized on poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)
ETHERNO DNA nanostructure production system
ETHERNO synthesized component strands of NDC and NDC-AS
Submitted parts formed tetrahedral nanostructures visible under transmission electron microscope .
