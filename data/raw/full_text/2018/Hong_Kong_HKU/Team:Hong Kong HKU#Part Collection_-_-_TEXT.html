Nano Drug Carrier-AS (NDC-AS)
Best basic part:
Bacterial synthesis of DNA aptamer AS1411
BBa_K2592006
This BioBrick encodes Strand 2-AS, which is a part of the nanostructure tetrahedral base, with nucleolin aptamer AS1411 attached to its 5' end.
This part is one of the few iGEM BioBricks designed for synthesis of DNA aptamers inside E. coli. Over the years, many iGEM teams have registered BioBricks containing only the aptamer sequences they designed. The Strand 2-AS sequence in this part can be easily substituted with any other DNA aptamer sequences using the assembly standards desribed above.
Parts for other NDC-AS components
BBa_K2592005
This BioBrick encodes Strand 1-AS, which is a modified NDC Strand 1 with extended binding sequence to Strand 5-AS to increase strand displacement specificity.
BBa_K2592007
This BioBrick encodes Strand 5-AS, which is modified from NDC Strand 5 with extended binding sequence to Strand 1-AS of the tetrahedral body. Part of this strand is a displacement toehold complimentary to miR21. The 5' section next to the toehold is complimentary to another target, miR217, while the 3' end binds complimentarily to part of Strand 1.
BBa_K2592002
BioBrick coding NDC/NDC-AS strand 3, part of the tetrahedral body of the nanostructure.
BBa_K2592003
BioBrick coding NDC/NDC-AS strand 4, part of the tetrahedral body of the nanostructure.

Nano Drug Carrier (NDC)
Parts for synthesizing NDC components
BBa_K2592000
BioBrick coding NDC Strand 1, which holds Strand 5 in place on the tetrahedral nanostructure by complimentary base pairing.
BBa_K2592001
BioBrick coding NDC strand 2, part of the tetrahedral body of the nanostrcuture.
BBa_K2592002
BioBrick coding NDC/NDC-AS strand 3, part of the tetrahedral body of the nanostructure.
BBa_K2592003
BioBrick coding NDC/NDC-AS strand 4, part of the tetrahedral body of the nanostructure.
BBa_K2592004
BioBrick coding NDC strand 5, part of which is a displacement toehold complimentary to miR21. The 5' section next to the toehold is complimentary to another target, miR217. The 3' end binds complimentarily to part of Strand 1.
