Fifth International InterLab Measurement Study
Aim
This year, we participated in the Fifth international InterLab Measurement Study. This collective study among the world aims at promoting synthetic biology into a real engineering discipline by improving the repeatability and reliability of current measurement tools. Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) signal is harnessed as a measurement marker in most synthetic biology study. Be that as it may, variability and abstract ways of presentation make it harder to repeat and duplicate the results.   By collecting data generated by the same protocol and standardised equipment and settings, iGEM community could utilise it to reduce lab-to-lab variability of GFP measurement. This year, the aim of InterLab study is to normalising fluorescence measurements using absolute cell count and colony-forming units (CFU) instead of OD.  One of the challenges in this InterLab study is to ensure the correct value of absorbance and OD. In order to standardise the signals and the data, an initial OD and hence a correct cell concentration are crucial.
