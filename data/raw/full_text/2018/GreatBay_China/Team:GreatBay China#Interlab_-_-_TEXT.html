Introduction of Interlab
Reliable and repeatable measurement plays an important role as an engineering discipline in synthetic biology. The InterLab Study aims to identify and correct the sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology measurement, thus to improve the measurement tools and methods which can enable labs to reliably build upon others’ work. It will promote the collaboration within the synthetic biology community. Hence, it may propel the synthetic biology to achieve its full potential.
The previous InterLab studies showed that measuring GFP expression in absolute fluorescence units calibrated against a known concentration of fluorescent molecule can greatly reduce the variability in different labs’ measurements.
The Fifth Year InterLab’s goal is to remove another source of variability, the number of cells in the sample, by using new cell-counting method.
GreatBay_China investigation had helped in answering the question:Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD?

Field Work
For the reason that our plate reader could only measure the absorbance, we collaborated with SZU-China and borrowed their plate reader.
Day 1
The plasmids from distribution kit had been resuspended and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α
Day 2
Single colonies had been picked from transformation plates and inoculated into LB medium
All the supplies and reagents for Calibration and Cell measurement had been prepared
Day 3
The three calibration had been done during the dilution of overnight cultures
The Cell measurement had been done following the protocol
The flow cytometer collected the samples after measured each plate
Protocol: Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E. coli cultures had been done
Day 4
Count the colonies (thanks the ColonyCount from promega)
