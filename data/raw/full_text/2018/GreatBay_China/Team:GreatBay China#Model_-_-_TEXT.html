We
built an ODE kinetics framework to model the mutualistic co-culture system of E. coli and S. cerevisiae we intended to use in our  project, taking into account substrate utilization, product inhibitions and product formation involved in two species' interactions. By recording  the growth of the two engineered strains in co-culture and performing parameter sensitivity analyses, we were able to better interpret the  behavior of the system.
