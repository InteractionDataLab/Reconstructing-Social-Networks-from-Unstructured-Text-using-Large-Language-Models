We discussed with audiences including artists, students, investors and engineers who inquired about the safety and potential of synbio eagerly. And engineers and artists established long-term collaboration with us on applied design. We closely engaged with neighborhood, urban management agencies and animal welfare groups, presenting how microbial factory can integrate with cat shelter we built to solve the problem of feral cats. Through direct interviews, in-depth conversations, presentations or polls, we learnt their concerns and how synbio-related design can be better accepted by the public. Innovatively, we connect with people in art field by holding activities which allow the public to draw and design the cat shelter. Moreover, we filmed a series of documentaries to reach even further, by uploading them on popular media platforms.

Then we discussed our ultimate scheme of building a street cat shelter with biosynthesized nepetalactone as attractant that could aid volunteers in helping feral cats. (See <A href="‘https://2018.igem.org/Team:GreatBay_China/Applied_Design’">Applied Design</A> for the development of our design.)
</P><P style="font-family: Delius; font-size: 18px;">
Our audiences include students, neighborhood committee members, engineers, designers, artists and investors, who demonstrated great curiosity at the field of synthetic biology and engaged enthusiastically in discussions concerning synbio and our project after the talk. We had audiences who inquire about the possibility of initiating their own synbio project at the maker space or at home, so we gladly filled in knowledge about biosafety lab requirements we had, shamefully, missed out a bit on during the talk. Some asked in details how we found the desire pathway of biosynthesizing nepetalactol and whether computer simulation could aid the design, and we offered several databases that might be of help. Though we must admit due to lack of sufficient knowledge in computational tools, we were unable to explore further concerning the latter question. Afterwards, many participants demanded us to tell them more interesting iGEM projects, which we shared with delight.<I>During this experience, we noticed how starting with innovative iGEM projects and the application of synbio can help engage audiences before we filled them with the engineering principle behind. However, it was necessary to discuss biosafety and bioethics, especially facing listeners who enjoy creation.</I>
More offered keen advice on the Kitty Wonderland prototype, such as how volunteers could supervise the shelter and how the shelter might be able to alert volunteers when several cats are present, so volunteers can come, feed or trap cats for neutering and vaccination. </P><H5 style="text-align: center;">Group photo of some of the participants.</H5><H1 class="title">Discussions with animal-welfare groups, neighborhood and local government on the applied design of our project</H1><P style="font-family: Delius; font-size: 18px;">Our applied design, the cat shelter, aims to help volunteers who care about the welfare of feral cats. So aside from engaging with Fenghua Li’s volunteer group in the first place, we also participated in an event advocating civilized rules for pet keeping, in which we interviewed participants, who were considering adopting pets, about their opinions on a cat shelter using nepetalactone as attractant being placed in their neighborhood. They pointed out we could organize residents who fed feral cats occasionally to manage the shelter through connecting with neighborhood committees. Aside, some said their neighbors might not want feral cats gathering near their residents, so we needed to consider where the house should be placed cautiously. </P><H5 style="text-align: center;">Lucinda, Eden and Rocky: Ready for interview at the event advocating civilized rules for pet keeping. </H5><P style="font-family: Delius; font-size: 18px;">Together with a talk on our design at an animal welfare event, we gained more insights into the problem of feral cats and how our design might be of use to the volunteers and feral cats through conversing with members from welfare groups including the director of  <BUTTON type="button" class="btn btn-primary" title="SDPA" data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Small Dog Protection Association, focusing on advocating civilized pet keeping and helping abandoned pet dogs find new owners.">

 Following the successful demonstration at the faire, we intend the wonderland and synthetic biology to children in school, teaching them basic concepts of synthetic biology and raising their awareness on the problem of stray cats.

She persists in feeding, neutering and saving stray cats for 20 years without a single day-off. She rescues cats as a full-time profession. However, the cat shelter she built was destroyed by an arsonist two years ago and after that the government was prohibiting the construction of new cat shelters. Thence she had to roam across the city to feed those helpless creatures and to catch and to neuter them as well as to treat them when they are injured or sick, whereas when Aunt Li was injured or sick she had to carry on. Moreover, Aunt Li is suffering from osteoporosis for many years. Her life is a hardship even though a lot of people gave her hands. GreatBay_China helped her in raising funds and public awareness.

Where: Shenzhen University
When: 6 May
Hosted by: SZU_China
Officially presenting our project mCATNIP to other iGEMers for the first time, we introduced the key element in project design — chassis specialization, and our human practice plan for applying the microbial catnip to feral cats rescue. Many questions have been asked regarding the human practice of mCATNIP: why is this method better than the existing ones, what if the use of catnip increased the level of aggression among feral cats etc.
We were very glad to hear suggestions from other teams. Meanwhile, we listened to the presentation of other teams and exchanged opinions.

Where: Bluepha Lab, Shenzhen
When: 24 June
Hosted by: GreatBay_China, SFLS_Shenzhen
High school iGEM teams have relatively fewer resources available to them compared to the graduate teams. Therefore GreatBay_China and SFLS_Shenzhen hosted the Shenzhen High School Meetup together for sharing our resources conveniently with others Shenzhen high school teams as well as finding in what ways could we collaborate. Teams presented their projects, and we invited our advisor Yiming Dong to give feedbacks.

Where: Shenzhen
When: 24 July ~ 26 July
Hosted by: TU-Delft, BGIC-Global
From Jun/24 to Jun/26, we participated in the EurAsian Meetup organized by the teams TUDelft and BGI-College. We spared no efforts to present in an interesting and educating way and engage other teams. During the meetup, we received suggestions about the project (including how to convert nepetalactol to nepetalactone, what variables should be concerned in the co-culture system, etc.), presentation, poster and even mathematical modeling from various teams like TUDelft, EPFL, XJTLU China and SCUT China. 

Apart from obtaining suggestions, we also spread out idea effectively during the meetup by presenting as well as communicating with other teams. Our presentation in the meetup received the award as one of the two ‘Best Presentation’ teams among all. During the discussion, because of our teammate Rocky’s special talk on his understanding of biosafety, he was interviewed by TUDelft as a part of their human practice.


We also learned the essence of biosafety during the meetup, which helped us a lot when we were conducting our human practice after the event. We discovered that the key idea of ensuring biosafety in our project is through ‘Value Sensitive Design’, which is to contemplate whether our product will violate the rules in biosafety or challenge bioethics and use these concerns to improve our product to make it safer. We almost applied the strategy of ‘Value Sensitive Design’ extensively throughout our human practice.

Where: Shanghai
When: 27 August ~ 31 August
Hosted by: ShanghaiTech

Lucinda Lin and Sean Yao represented our team to attend the 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community. We have gained much useful experience during the conference by not only communications with other teams but also feeling what it was like to be a judge. We received advice on our presentation and posters meanwhile sought help for yeast genetic circuit designs.
