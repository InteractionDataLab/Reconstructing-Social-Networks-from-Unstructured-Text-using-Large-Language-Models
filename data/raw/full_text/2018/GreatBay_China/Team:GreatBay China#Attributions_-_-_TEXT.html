Project Design
The initial idea of doing a project on catnip came from our advisor *Xuan Wang who mentioned to us the fact that catnip can be used as a green pesticide. Alexis Zeng did further research and saw the possibility of using a co-culture system for manufacturing. Lucinda Lin searched for strategies to optimize the microbial production, our primary PI *Dr. Haoqian Zhang recommended the use of TALE stabilized promoters.

Acknowledgment:
The journey of iGEM wasn’t an easy one, and GreatBay_China has received lots of help from many people. Here we would like to thank specially to the following people who have given us the kindest support:
Boxiang Wang
As a teacher in Bluepha Lab, Boxiang Wang offered us project-oriented training and taught us a set of courses on Molecular Biology, Synthetic Biology, Biosafety, and Ethics. Also as an iGEM coach, he gave us advice on project design and experiment planning, helped troubleshooting experiments, shared external resources, and attended our weekly meetings. Above all, he also taught us how to collect graphs and tables from experiments in a scientific and authoritative way.
Xuanyu Zhao
Xuanyu Zhao helped us to pick up many important habits for scientific research such as making strain lists and having standardized experiment records. Also by frequent discussions with us, she guided us through the difficulties encountered in experiments, for example, modifying the method to delete yeast genes.
Yiming Dong
Yiming Dong has given us numerous useful tips on molecular cloning experiments. She provided us with the plasmid to perform genome insertion. Also, she shot some videos with Fenghua Li for us, and these videos later became essential materials of our documentary.
Alicia Graham
Alicia Graham is a former member of iGEM team Paris Bettencourt and a current Ph.D. candidate at Imperial College London. During her internship at Bluepha, she kindly offered us training on how to use Matlab and basics on mathematic modelling in Biology. Thank you, Alicia, for your warm support and encouragement!
Li Yu and John Henry
Li Yu and John Henry from xFactory offered keen guidance to help us design the cat shelter “Kitty Wonderland”. John Henry taught Eden Yu how to use the laser cut-out machine to prepare materials for constructing the cat shelter.
Honghao Su
Honghao Su helped us with modeling by sharing what he had learned about Flux Balance Analysis and had attempted to use FBA for predicting the optimum expression level of GPPS and GES.
Harry Jiang
Harry is the student leader of team SIAT-SCIE 2017 and team RDFZ-China 2018. He is a student from Shenzhen College of International Education (SCIE). This year Harry helped to build team GreatBay China by gathering a group of students who were interested in iGEM and providing them with some basic training including reading papers, learning from previous teams. And this group of student later became some members of GreatBay China (Alexis Zeng, Eden You, Charles Wei). He also provided many suggestions of different aspects throughout the iGEM season.
Fenghua Li and members of her animal rescue team
Fenghua Li kindly allowed us to film her and the cats she rescued. Through direct interview and in-depth conversation, she and the members of her animal rescue team offered us an insight into the current situation and difficulties faced by feral cat rescue nowadays, which was crucially important guidance for our human practice. They also reviewed our design of cat shelter and gave us suggestions to modify the shelter.
Dr. Junbiao Dai
Dr. Junbiao Dai had given us lots of advice on yeast gene deletion and vector construction, which was a timely help as we didn’t have any experience working with yeast before.
Dr. Christopher Voigt
The excellent work of Dr. Christopher Voigt truly inspired us and encouraged us to explore more about the TALE stabilized promoters. During the 4th Synthetic Biology Young Scholar Forum, he answered our questions about the usage of the TALEsp and discussed with us the application of the TALEsp to metabolic engineered. After, Dr. Christopher Voigt kindly commended our project. His warm encouragement has made us more motivated in the journey of discovery about synthetic biology.
Weitong Guo
Weitong Guo, who majors bioinformatics. Weitong was the former dry lab leader, mathematical modeler and software designer in the team HZAU China 2017. He gave us a large amount of advice regarding our mathematical modeling as well as he provided vital assistance for our sensitivity analysis by drawing out the heat map.
Pre-iGEM training & project start:
Bluepha Lab offers synthetic biology education in the forms of winter camps and summer camps. The course syllabus and materials are not freely available online. In February 2018, majority members of GreatBay_China took part in the Cell Factory winter camp held in Bluepha Lab which lasted for five days and was taught by Boxiang Wang. It was during the winter camp that we first started brainstorming. The project started in March and the lab began in April.
