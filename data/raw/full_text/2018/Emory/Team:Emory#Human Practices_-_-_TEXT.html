Human Practices
Our experimental results suggest that recombinant bacteria, as opposed to protein purified from such a bacterium, could be applied to inactivate environmental toxins such as the organophosphate insecticide malathion. We suspected, however, that many people in our locale (Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A.) and elsewhere fear genetically modified (GM) bacteria more than of proven toxins.
We sought to test public opinion, but supposed that our project would confuse people. We approached passers-bye in their homes, at grocery stores or at a meeting of home poultry farmers and asked them how they would feel about a GM probiotic for chickens that would make meat and eggs more nutritious. Only three of the 28 consumers we interviewed would buy such a product.
The results of our unscientific survey were consistent with those of more systematic studies of consumer attitudes [ S. Wunderlich, K. A. Gatto, Adv Nutr 6, 842-851 (2015) ]. Scientific education is correlated with acceptance of GM foods, and more Americans are going to college. Other GM foods, materials and medical treatments will be reaching the market in the near future, and the proliferation of such products could cause some consumers to reconsider their stance.
We intend to continue listening to members of the lay public, and develop GM products that solve generally recognized problems.
