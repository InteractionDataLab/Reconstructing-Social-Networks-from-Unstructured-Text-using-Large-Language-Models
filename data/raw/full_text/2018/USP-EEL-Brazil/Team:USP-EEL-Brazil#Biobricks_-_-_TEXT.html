Our parts
We successfully submitted four parts to the Registry (see list below). Unfortunately, we were only able to characterize the Lac TT (BBa_K2603003). This part is in a plasmid (pETTrx-1a / LIC) different from the IGEM standard (pSBIC3), however, the Registry committee allowed us to submit it. We also had a problem on the 3A Assembly of one of our composite parts and we were not able to submit it: the Lac PH with LacI promoter.
Beside that, on the development of our project we discovered that the promoter (LacI) we chose for the composite parts wasn't effective as we first thought. The LacI would be able to express our enzymes on the absence of IPTG on the media, but it wouldn't be so effective. So, if we had more time and resources, we would have opted for a constitutive or a T7 promoter.
However, we have submitted interesting and novel parts to the Registry:
• BBa_K2603000 (basic part): Laccase from Pleurotus ostreatus NRRL0366 with RBS ( BBa_B0030 ).
• BBa_K2603001 (basic part): Laccase from Phoma sp. UHH 5-1-03 (DSM 2245) with RBS ( BBa_B0030 ).
• BBa_K2603002 (composite part): Laccase from Pleurotus ostreatus NRRL0366 with RBS ( BBa_B0030 ) and Regulated LacI promoter ( BBa_R0010 )
• BBa_K2603003: Laccase from Thielavia terrestris with HisTag, to help in purification, and a TEV site for HisTag clevage.
