Sponsors
The development of scientific initiatives in Brazil still remains a big challenge to the researchers, especially when it comes to students. Getting financial support is one of the most difficult and time consuming steps to be overcome, so facing a challenge like that, the iGEM USP-EEL-BRAZIL team is grateful to all sponsors and supporters for the financial and structural support that made possible our project LACQUASE.
We were able to count on the financial support of our university (USP), through its pro-rectories and institutes. We also got structural support with softwares from SnapGene and MatLab, which were important for design and modeling. Finally, the sponsorships of NEB, Uniscience, Promega and specially IDT were fundamental for the lab work, providing enzymes, gBlocks, oligos and other materials. Also, we are specially grateful for the SYMB Lab for the structure and all the support which made our project possible.
