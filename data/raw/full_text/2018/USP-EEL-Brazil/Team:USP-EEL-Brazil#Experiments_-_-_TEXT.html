For a better comprehension, we separated our experiments according to their purpose. In Molecular Biology are presented all the steps involving the   obtainment of our plasmids. In Expression and Purification are described the steps from the transformation until the   obtainment of our enzyme. The Biochemical Characterization presents the experiments we performed on our purified laccase.

Biochemical Characterization
Molecular Biology
The molecular biology stage is the initial part of our project in relation to LabWork. To obtain the enzyme of interest, laccase, the following steps must be taken:
Amplification of gene (PCR); (seria legal se cada um desses tópicos fossem redirecionados para os respectivos protocolos)
Gene cloning (3A Assemlby);
Bacterial transformation;
Expression and purification of enzyme;
Here we will address the steps of amplification, cloning and transformation. To carry out the experiments you need the genetic material (primers, promoters, RBSs, genes, terminators, vectors, etc)
The genes we are working on, LacPL and LacPH, are constituted of RBS ( BBa_B0030 ) and CDS. The promoter and the terminator were used of BBa_R0010 (Kit plate 3 Well 4G). The cloning was made inserting the genes into the BBa_R0010 .
Our DNA was synthetized in gBlock format by IDT.

Preparing the plasmids
Made the amplification of genes, we prepared the vector with LacI promoter ( BBa_R0010 ) and linearized plasmide backbone pSB1C3 (2016) for insertion of genes. The BBa_R0010 was transformaded in DH5alpha for production of more plasmids.

Ligation (3A Assembly)
With the plasmids and the genes ready, we did 3A Assembly to insert our gene. First, we inserted the gene into linearized plasmid pSB1C3 from USP-EEL BRAZIL Team 2016, because we do not have the DpnI enzyme. For this reason, we tried insert also into BBa_J04450

Simultaneously, we did 3A Assembly for insertion of the gene into BBa_R0010 . The 3A Assembly protocol was modified as follows: The part “A” was cleaved using SpeI and PstI and the gene was cleaved by Xbal and Pstl. By making the ligation, the site for part A’s Spel ligates to the site of the Xbal of our gene, making the “M” point. Then the Pstl’s site of the plasmid of our gene ligate and close the plasmid.

Looking at the results of imagen 9 and 10, we can confirm that the genes are in the colony with the gene LacPL in BBa_R0010 (Lacl promoter) and LacPL in the linearized vector and also LacPH in BBa_J04450 .
Cloning
We cultivated the positive colonies above overnight for production of plasmids. The plasmid was purified using Miniprep (Promega).

Expression and Purification
The purification step is known as the step, which we obtain the laccases for further testing, characterization and its applications. For reasons of lack of time and material, we weren’t able to produce the laccases LacPL and LacPH. However, we could work on LacTT, gifted by Evandro José Mulinari.  All the designed parts has LacI as promotor. So the expression will happen in presence of lactose or IPTG, therefore the culture medium of bacteria is a lactose-containing autoinducing medium. For each liter of medium there is:

Pre-inoculum
After preparing and sterilizing the autoinducing medium, the pre-inoculum was prepared.  For each liter of autoinducing medium, 10 ml of pre-inoculum were prepared using 10 ml of LB medium + 10 μl of kanamycin + 10 μl of chloramphenicol and inoculated with 20 μl of the glycerinated stock of the transformant. The pre-inoculum was cultured overnight at 37 ° C at 180 rpm.
Production of biomass and expression
The next day 10 ml of pre-inoculum was inoculated into 1L of an auto-inducing medium. The culture was incubated at 37 ° C at 130 rpm. The optical density was monitored up to the value of 0.6 at 600 nm, which corresponds to the log phase of cell growth. Upon reaching the log phase, CuSO4 was added to the auto-inducing medium at a final concentration of 0.1 mM. After adding the salt the culture was incubated at 18 ° C and 130 rpm overnight.

Cell lysis
After 16 h of culture, the medium was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 2 h to separate the cells. Cells were resuspended in cell lysis buffer. For each liter of culture, a maximum of 50 ml of buffer was used.

With the cells resuspended in the lysis buffer, the medium was sonicated to promote sonication-mediated lysis. The protocol of the device itself was used for cell lysis, which is: 40% of power and cycles of 30 seconds, totaling 15 minutes of sonication, that is, 30 minutes of operation.

Purification
After lysis, the proteins were available in the liquid phase. The solution was then clarified by centrifugation at 11000 rpm for two 45 min cycles.

The purification of LacTT will be performed using the chromatography system equipment AKTA PURE and will be two steps: first, affinity using Nickel column and the second step will be gel filtration. LacTT was designed in such a way that the protein contains HisTag. HisTag has an affinity for Nickel and will be retained in the Nickel column, as well as other proteins that may have an affinity with Nickel. This way it is possible to separate most of the proteins present in the medium.

Looking at chromatography profile we took the fraction corresponding to the peaks: fractions 4, 5 and 7 for the biggest peak; fractions 24, 25, 31, 33 for the other peaks and fraction 46 to check if there are no proteins present, using the protein electrophoresis technique.

The molecular weight of the LacTT with HisTag is around 80 kDa. Analyzing the electrophoresis and chromatography profiles we took the elution fraction from number 30 to 38 to carry out the gel filtration.
Gel filtration chromatography
With the eluted fractions containing the LacTT the gel filtration was done

We collected the fractions containing the laccase and concentrated in a final volume of 10 ml. And so we obtained purified laccase to proceed with biochemical characterization.

LacPL and LacPH do not have HisTag. Therefore, purification will be done first by ion exchange chromatography. Knowing the isoelectric point of the enzymes is possible to carry out the purification. After the ion exchange chromatography will be done gel filtration.
Biochemical Characterization
At this biochemical characterization step, we’ll do enzymatic tests to find the optimal pH and temperature of the enzyme, as well as the activity (using ABTS substrate) and inhibitory activity of some compounds like F- and Cl-. Furthermore, it will be tested interferers degradation of endocrine disruptors. Due to lack of time and materials, it has been done the LacTT characterization. For the LacPL and LacPH characterization, it will be used the same tests.
Quantification of protein
Firstly, it’s needed to quantify the enzyme. Two measurements were taken: bradford method and using nano drop.
Image 1: Bradford cure. Source: Josman Velasco.
The OD of our sample was 0.7664. Isolating the X from the straight equation, we have 112 μg / mL protein.
The measured protein concentration by NanoDrop OneC at wavelength 280 nm was 109 μg / ml.

Analyning both of results of concentration is possible to conclude that the values are very close, with percentual error of 2,7%
Caracterization
For the tests, it was assembled the reaction:
160 uL of phosphate-citrate-glycine buffer 100 mM (pH depends on the test)
20 uL of enzyme;
20 uL of ABTS 1mM;
Laccase oxides the ABTS forming a blue compound. Its absorbance was measured at 420 nm on spectrophotometer.
pH assay
Thielavia terrestris is a thermophilic fungus, so the optimum pH determination assays were conducted at 60 ° C. It was tested pH from 2.0; 2.5; 3.0; 3.5; 4.0; 4,5; 5.0; 5.5; 6.0; 6.5; 7.0 and 7.5 utilizando 100 mM citrate phosphate glycine buffer.

The optimum pH for LacTT activity is pH 4,0. For the effluent treatment if interesting a pH around 7,0. However, in the pH 7,0, the LacTT do not have a good activity.
Temperature assay
It has been determined that the optimal pH for the laccase of Thielavia terrestris is 4.0. Knowing the optimum pH proceeded for the optimum temperature test. Using pH 4.0 tests were performed at temperatures of 30; 35; 40; 45; 50; 55; 60; 65; 70; 75 and 80 °C.

The optimum temperature for LacTT is 55°C. Knowing the pH and optimum temperature, tests were carried out to determine the maximum activity using ABTS.

With the equation of the linear region of the curve, the maximum laccase activity can be calculated.

Tests were also carried out to verify the inhibition of laccase. According to Auriol (2007) fluoride, ion and chloride ion has inhibition activity in laccases. The reaction was assembled as follows:
150 µl of citrate fosfate glycine buffer pH 4,0;
20 µl of enzyme;
20 µl of ABTS;
10 µl of inhibitor;
Image 7: Test of inhibition using NaF. Source: Personal arquive.
Its possible to observe a little reduction in the activity has occurred, which confirms the partial inhibition of laccase by fluoride  To the inhibition test with Cl- it was used ClO-. However, it wasn’t possible to conclude anything with this experiment, because the ClO- degrades the ABTS, discoloring the medium.

We started the endocrine disrupters degradation tests. We did tests with Bisphenol A (BPA), Nonylphenol and ß-estradiol.
First, we looked on the literature to know about the maximum absorption wave length of each compound. The wave length for ß-estradiol is 280 nm (VERBINNEN; NUNES, 2010). For the nonylphenol, it is 277nm (AHEL; GIGER, 1985) and for BPA the wave length is 280nm.
With the wave length information, we carried ou tests of degradation of BPA and ß-estradiol according to the following reagents volumes:
160 µl of citrate fosfate glycine buffer pH 4,0;
20 µl of enzyme;
20 ul of substrate;
The reaction was assembled at 55 °C for 1 hour in a plate with 96 well to monitoring the absorbance.
Image 9: Test of degradation of BPA and ß-estradiol. Source: Personal arquive.
Analyzing the results were raised some hypotheses. LacTT degraded BPA resulting in decreased absorbance or LacTT had no activity on BPA and ß-estradiol.
To investigate whether the laccase has no activity at all, TLC and HPLC analyzes were performed.

Unfortunately, it was not possible to detect BPA by HPLC. The peak shown in the chromatogram corresponds to the buffer.      For TLC, it was possible to detect BPA, but the reaction chromatography profile was the same as the standard, indicating that it had neither degradation nor polymerization of the substrate.

Unfortunately no further experiments could be carried out, because it was not possible to express and purify the LacPL and LacPH due to the lack of time and resources. However, we intend to continue the characterizations after the Jamboree.
