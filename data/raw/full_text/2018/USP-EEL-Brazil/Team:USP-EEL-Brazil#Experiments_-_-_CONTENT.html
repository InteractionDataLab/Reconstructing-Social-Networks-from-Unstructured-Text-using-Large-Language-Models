    	After preparing and sterilizing the autoinducing medium, the pre-inoculum was prepared. 
For each liter of autoinducing medium, 10 ml of pre-inoculum were prepared using 10 ml of LB medium + 10 μl of kanamycin + 10 μl of chloramphenicol and inoculated with 20 μl of the glycerinated stock of the transformant. The pre-inoculum was cultured overnight at 37 ° C at 180 rpm.

    	The next day 10 ml of pre-inoculum was inoculated into 1L of an auto-inducing medium. The culture was incubated at 37 ° C at 130 rpm. The optical density was monitored up to the value of 0.6 at 600 nm, which corresponds to the log phase of cell growth. Upon reaching the log phase, CuSO4 was added to the auto-inducing medium at a final concentration of 0.1 mM. After adding the salt the culture was incubated at 18 ° C and 130 rpm overnight.

		The purification of LacTT will be performed using the chromatography system equipment AKTA PURE and will be two steps: first, affinity using Nickel column and the second step will be gel filtration. LacTT was designed in such a way that the protein contains HisTag. HisTag has an affinity for Nickel and will be retained in the Nickel column, as well as other proteins that may have an affinity with Nickel. This way it is possible to separate most of the proteins present in the medium.

		The optimum pH for LacTT activity is pH 4,0. For the effluent treatment if interesting a pH around 7,0. However, in the pH 7,0, the LacTT do not have a good activity.
        
</P><H5>Temperature assay</H5><P>It has been determined that the optimal pH for the laccase of Thielavia terrestris is 4.0.

Using pH 4.0 tests were performed at temperatures of 30; 35; 40; 45; 50; 55; 60; 65; 70; 75 and 80 °C.</P><CENTER><P><SUB><B>Image 4</B>: The effect of temperature on the relative activity of LacTT. Source: Personal arquive.</SUB></P></CENTER><P>

		Tests were also carried out to verify the inhibition of laccase. According to Auriol (2007) fluoride, ion and chloride ion has inhibition activity in laccases. The reaction was assembled as follows:
	</P><UL><LI>150 µl of citrate fosfate glycine buffer pH 4,0;
    </LI><LI>20 µl of enzyme;
    </LI><LI>20 µl of ABTS;
    <LIL>10 µl of inhibitor;
    </LIL></LI></UL><CENTER><P><SUB><B>Image 7</B>: Test of inhibition using NaF. Source: Personal arquive.</SUB></P></CENTER><P>
    	Its possible to observe a little reduction in the activity has occurred, which confirms the partial inhibition of laccase by fluoride

To the inhibition test with Cl- it was used ClO-. However, it wasn’t possible to conclude anything with this experiment, because the ClO- degrades the ABTS, discoloring the medium.

    	We started the endocrine disrupters degradation tests. We did tests with Bisphenol A (BPA), Nonylphenol and ß-estradiol. 
	</P><P>
    	First, we looked on the literature to know about the maximum absorption wave length of each compound. The wave length for ß-estradiol is 280 nm (VERBINNEN; NUNES, 2010). For the nonylphenol, it is 277nm (AHEL; GIGER, 1985) and for BPA the wave length is 280nm.
        </P><P>
   	With the wave length information, we carried ou tests of degradation of BPA and ß-estradiol according to the following reagents volumes:</P><UL><LI>160 µl of citrate fosfate glycine buffer pH 4,0;
    </LI><LI>20 µl of enzyme;
    </LI><LI>20 ul of substrate;
    </LI></UL><P>
   The reaction was assembled at 55 °C for 1 hour in a plate with 96 well to monitoring the absorbance.

	Analyzing the results were raised some hypotheses. LacTT degraded BPA resulting in decreased absorbance or LacTT had no activity on BPA and ß-estradiol.
    
</P><P>
	To investigate whether the laccase has no activity at all, TLC and HPLC analyzes were performed.

	Unfortunately, it was not possible to detect BPA by HPLC. The peak shown in the chromatogram corresponds to the buffer.
     For TLC, it was possible to detect BPA, but the reaction chromatography profile was the same as the standard, indicating that it had neither degradation nor polymerization of the substrate.</P><CENTER><CENTER><P><SUB><B>Image 10</B>: Thin layer chromatography. a) Chromatographic profile of different concentration of BPA. b) Chromatographic profile of degradation test.

However, we intend to continue the characterizations after the Jamboree.
