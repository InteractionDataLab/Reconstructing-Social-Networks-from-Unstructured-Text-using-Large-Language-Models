Synthetic Biology Club (CBSin) is a student entity from EEL-USP dedicated to study and disseminate knowledge of natural sciences, mainly  synthetic biology. It was founded in 2014 at EEL with André Hermann doing his best to draw the attention of teachers and students to the synthetic biology subject. In the beginning, André and his friends started to invite researchers from EEL’s biochemistry department to speak about molecular biology, molecular biology techniques, and other subjects. Over time, CBSin got structured by a board director (president, vice-President, marketing, events & logistics, financial and human resources), new members were added, and it was a crucial step that allowed us to formulate, in 2015, the idea of participating in iGem.
In 2016, CBSin already was consolidated as a student entity, so the first participation in iGem took place with the E.Coil Project , which received a bronze medal and gave greater visibility to the club, leading to increased activities. Today, CBSin develops and disseminates knowledge of synthetic biology on both the university and social spheres, aiming to become a reference for the development of synthetic biology nucleus in Brazil, with a focus on teamwork, determination, and bioethics. Becoming a bridge that closes the gap between Brazilian science and its society is our dream!
All members of IGEM team 2018 are also part of CBSin, and our dream is one day that all members of the Club be also participants of IGEM!.
