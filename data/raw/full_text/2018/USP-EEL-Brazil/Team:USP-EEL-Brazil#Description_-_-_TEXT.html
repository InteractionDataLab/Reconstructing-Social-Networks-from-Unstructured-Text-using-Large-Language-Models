Estrogens
The presence of estrogens in water bodies is increasing. These compounds are endocrine disrupters biologically active even in small concentrations. They can be especially toxic to fish and cause long term harmful effectes in humans and other animals. Due to the lack of effective treatment in effluents for the removal of these micropollutants, contaminated waters continuously return to the environment. Our team's proposal is to create a method for degradation of estrogens from water. We intend to use genetically engenireed laccase enzymes from fungi to remove this microcontaminants from sewage. Our final plan is to simulate a real apliccation of this biodegration system in effluent and water treatement stations. In the end, our goal is to clean our water!
