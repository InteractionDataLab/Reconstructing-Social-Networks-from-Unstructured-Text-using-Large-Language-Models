Also, it is based on information and concerns we got from our Integrated HP and come collaborations.
<P>Our application is divided on three topics: Scale-up that presents a model of how our project would work on real conditions; Biosafety brings the concern we gained for the safety in our system’s application; Legislation is the result of our determination to see how our project fits into our country’s reality.

To analyze the possibility of a real scale plant, we collected data about Lorena’s wastewater treatment station (the small city where we live, where we study and where we’re trying to improve life’s quality around), and we did a scale up based on the feed and effluent of this treatment station. At the end of the page, you’ll be able to find the structural data about the wastewater treatment station that was provided to us by SABESP (distribution and water treatment company of São Paulo). </P><P>Our wastewater treatment is composed of 2 modules of 2 pounds. They’re added in series with a facultative pond after the aerobic pond. The total hydraulic residence time of the system (considering both ponds) is 13,8 days. The medium flux feed is 150 L/s and the effluent is 150L/s. All of that can be confirmed at the document on the end of the page. </P><P>Using some data from our bibliographic references and some models we developed, we could find viable dimensions for the application of the reactor in our city.</P><P>According to Hofman &amp; Schlosser (2015),  the PH laccase could be used to apply into a system of a 2L bench enzymatic membrane reactor. They used only 100U/L to remove 4mg/L of EDC, while Lloret (2012) used 500U/L or 2000U/L, and is a “low” quantity of enzyme to use. We’ve scaled up the 2L EMR with the 100U/L and compared with the other parameters (used by Lloret). We established a proportionality between initial concentration and initial activity to helps us on the scaling. </P><P>The stirring would be done by a vertical blade, which can be ideal for non-viscous and slightly viscous fluids, once the feed composition of the reactor isn’t constant along the year. Our system would be implemented at the end of the regular system, after the pond treatments, having a feed of 150 L/s. Our system is shown in Figure 1. </P><CENTER><P><SUB><B>Figure 1</B>: Application of the laccase system on Lorena’s wastewater treatment station.</SUB></P></CENTER><P>For the scale-up we considered to keep the power per unit volume of medium. For cylindrical tanks, the power number is described by equation (1).</P><P>Where N is the rotation frequency, D<SUB>i</SUB> is the impeller diameter, P is the power and ρ is the density of reaction mixture. We considered that the density of the reaction system is very close to the density of the water, making possible to use ρ=1kg/m<SUP>3</SUP> and µ=1.002Pa/s. </P><P>We’ve also used the equation (2), (3), (4) and (5) to establish relations about the bench scale and real scale system.

According to the Re=0.2772, it’s possible to find the Np=60, that implies P=35.56W for the bench scale. Using a relation between laccase concentration and initial activity, we find a constant k, as shown in the equation (6), and used on equation (7). As we plan to use the same concentration of laccase (100U/L), the denominator is equal to 1. </P><P>The EDCs concentration expected in real scale was used as a sum of all data Auriol (2007) published.

We believe that the use of purified laccases in a reactor is the safest form for applications in sewage treatment station or water treatment station, since the effluent treatment process itself deactivates the enzyme in the chlorination step, preventing any type of contamination of the treated effluent. 
</P><P>Yet, as our enzymes would be obtained from a genetically modified <I>E. coli</I>, we saw as a concern the need for a biosafety measure. So, we searched for killswich mechanisms that could fit our proposal.
</P><P>Unfortunately, we were unable to test the planned killswitch, so all bacteria produced in the laboratory, after protein production and cell lysis, were treated with sanitary water to ensure safety standards. However, for future applications, we designed a simple mechanism to end our <I>E. coli</I> in large-scale processes.</P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-6 top-buffer" style="text-align:justify;"><P><B>BBa_R0040</B></P><P>The plasmid pSB1AT3, gives a new resistance to Tetracycline for our E.coli. Therefore, during the enzymatic production process, we add anhydrotetracycline in the medium and the Tet operator will be deactivated by the presence of the antibiotic. That is why we chose the BBa_R0040 promoter.
</P><P> In the absence of anhydrotetracycline, the promoter is ON. &quot;In contrast to tetracycline, anhydrotetracycline is a particularly useful inducer. It binds Tet R with an ~35-fold higher binding constant and thus allows to operate at very low concentrations. At the same time, its antibiotic activity is ~100-fold lower and concentrations of &lt;50 ng/ml as required for the full induction of P LtetO-1 have no effect on the growth of <I>E. coli.</I>&quot;
</P><P>With our promoter ON, begins the production of a lysozyme that acts in two steps for the activation of ColicinE7 that will generate cell death.
</P><P><B>BBa_K117000 and Colicin E7</B></P><P>Colicin E7 is a type of Colicin, a bacteriocin made by E. coli which acts against other nearby E. coli to kill them with its DNase Activity; it digests the cell's genome in specific locations, ultimately leading to the death of the cell. After synthesis inside the E. coli cell, the colicin binds its Colicin Immunity Protein, Im7, to its nuclease domain, to prevent the host cell from being killed by its activity.</P></DIV></DIV><P><B>•	First step: Release of ColE7 from ColE7—Immunity complex</B>
This function causes the detachment of ColE7 from Immunity protein, hence switches on the endonuclease activity of ColE7
</P><P><B>•	Second stage: Partial lysis of host cell membrane</B> 
This function induces the lysis of host cell, exposing the interior cell contents and hence allows free diffusion of ColE7 proteins towards pathogenic bacteria strains.</P></DIV><DIV id="L" class="tabcontent"><H4 class="grey-text heading-weight" align="left" style="font-size:40px; font-family:Broadway;">Introduction</H4><P style="margin-bottom: 10px;  text-align: justify;     text-indent: 3%; ">Since the LACQUASE project has its scope focused on the improvement of water quality in Brazil and countries with similar water and sanitary structures, a study was carried out on the current legislation regarding the water treatment process.
