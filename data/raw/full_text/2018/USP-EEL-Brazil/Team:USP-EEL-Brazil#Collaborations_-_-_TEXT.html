Brazilian Meet Up
In collaboration with other Brazilian teams USP-Brazil and Unesp_Brazil , and also with former and future iGEM teams, we organized and participated in the Brazilian Meetup: Jamboré Brasuca. This event, named in honor of the Giant Jamboree, is a tradition among Brazilian teams, happening since 2010.
This year, the Jamboré took place at USP-ESALQ (Piracicaba-SP) on March 2nd and 3rd. There, we presented our 2018 project and saw other team projects from 2017 and future ones. Also, we had several lectures with synthetic biology experts including the international speakers Drew Endy, David García Gomez, Thomas Landrain and companies like Braskem and SENAI-CETIQT.
Latin America Meet Up
On early July, the Tec CEM iGEM team hosted a meet up for the Latin America teams. Via Skype, we presented our project's development until that point and received some great feedback.
Many of the comments that were made helped on the improvement of our presentation and our wiki, specially related to the Background and Design of our project.
The event had the participation of 8 teams, these being teams from Brazil, Chile, Ecuador and México. Also, with these same teams it was created a WhatsApp group for us to keep communicating.
Labs Like you
Tec CEM team also had the amazing idea of creating a parody of “Girls Like You” and “Moves Like Jagger” by Maroon 5, and invited all iGEM teams to participate. For us, it was a really funny moment that made our iGEM routine happier. These are the teams you can see on the video:
IISER Bhopal, AFCM, UNESP Brazil, WASHINGTON, Tust China, Bielefeld-CeBiTec, IISc-Bangalore, USP-Brazil, DUSSELDORF, GRONINGEN, DALHOUSIE, LEIDEN, UFLORIDA, TartuTUIT_IGEM, Toulouse NSA UPS, MICHIGAN STATE, UCHILE_Biotec, ECUADOR, Tec-Guadalajara, Tec-Chihuahua, UCSC, iTESLA-SoundBio, Tacoma RainMakers.
Kazakhstan Collab
Our collaboration with Kazakhstan team began when they contacted us to talk about molecular modelling. As we’re working with enzymes that can be highly influenced by their structures and their interactions, we were very glad to contribute with them.
We had a meet via Skype and we discussed and passed to them some of our data, and so they returned with a model, exploring the reasons behind all the molecular proprieties.
That’s important to understand the functioning of the protein and, maybe, we can solve certain problems or be able to find a probable substrate for the enzyme with these models.
Stockholm Collab
In September, we contacted the Stockholm team because our projects are similar and we wanted to exchange ideas and information. After a Skype meeting, we talked about how our projects were going and what we had done so far.
After this, they shared with us their knowledge about different Waste Water Treatment Plants presents in Sweden and we sent them the information we had about our local WWTP. With this information exchange, we were able to compare how Europe (Nordic) and South America (Brazil) regions treat their wastewater. This helped us on gain some perspective for our project's Application.
CCA San Diego Collab
Also in September, we received contact from CCA-San_Diego to do a collaboration. After some exchange on information about our projects, we decided to help their Public Engagement project
This iniciative consisted in a Video Series destinated to groups that want to attend on iGEM some day. It was a really nice way to see what we had achieved so far by sharing our expirience with future iGEMers. Check the videos here: https://2018.igem.org/Team:CCA-San_Diego/Engagement .
LATAM Magazine
Collecting information from Latin America teams, UChile_Biotec team designed a magazine that gathered several aspects of the competition and the projects of the participating teams, as well as integrating cultural information. We joined this project by sharing details and the implications of our project, our own experience as iGEM members and describing some interesting, fun elements of the Brazilian culture regarding science and biotechnology.
The final result is impressive and it can be seen here: https://2018.igem.org/Team:UChile_Biotec/LATAM
