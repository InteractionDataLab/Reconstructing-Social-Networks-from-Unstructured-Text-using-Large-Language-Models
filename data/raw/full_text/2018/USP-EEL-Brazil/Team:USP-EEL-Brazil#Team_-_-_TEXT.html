We are the Team USP-EEL-Brazil!
We are one of the few Brazilian teams attending on iGEM and it's the second time we represent the Engineering School of Lorena from the University of São Paulo (USP-EEL) on this competition.
When we were designing our team’s logo, we wanted to make it in a way to honor where we come from. For that, we decided use our School’s mascot: the mammoth.
Now, EEL´s mammoth will be in Boston with us, showing to the world, as our battle cry says: “Who is Lorena!”
Also, since in our project this year we focused on the reality in Brazil, we represented that in our project's logo.

Cibele Zolnier Sousa do Nascimento
I'm a undergraduate student in Biochemical Engineering at USP Lorena. What else can I tell you about me? Well, let's start by saying that I've always dreamed of becoming a scientist. When I got in USP, I met the Synthetic Biology Club (CBSin) and there I found a new passion on SynBio and a goal in attending to iGEM. I'm super excited that this dream is becoming true for me and the whole team. We are enjoying it the best we can!

Fernando Satoshi Tutihashi
My name is Fernando, a Biochemical Engineering student. I love to understand nature and how things work. Since I was a kid I used to simulate scientific experiments or build toys and I studied to do these, making some hypotheses to describe and understand phenomena, like a scientist.  It was my dream and now it has come true!! My other dream is to be a teacher and I hope to be able to contribute to the development of humanity.

Paulo Pereira Sforsin
I'm 20 years old and my relantionship with sinthetic biology came from the high school.  Participate in IGEM I'll realize one of my dreams and I'm so happy about this. Represent my country and my university at iGEM it's important because it shows that my team, my university, and my country can do science in a good way.  Take a look on our wiki and think about the water you're drinking. :)

Taise Schraier de Quadros
Halo! My name is Taise, and I am a Biochemical Engineering undergraduate student. I’m really excited about innovation and awesome ideas that can change the world, and I really feel this in biotechnology! Fascinates me the infinite possibilities that synthetic biology opens to solve daily simple problems, or even the big problems. I admire young scientists that are exploring synthetic biology, and I want to be part of this revolution as well!

Gustavo Jorge Paulo
Hi guys how are you doing? My name is Gustavo, I am a biochemical engineering student. I like to spend my free time learning new languages. I am a former member from the NGOs: CISV and AIESEC. I saw in iGEM an opportunity to reconcile two things that I love: nature science and social development, I was very delighted with the project and it is been a pleasure to participate in it and to belong to this wonderful team.

Marcus Vinicius Freitas Nascimento
Hello crazy people, I'm Marcus, a musician, and a biochemical engineering student! I always loved to build new things and learn about science stuff. In high school, I was introduced to biotechnology and how science can save lives. Since that, my biggest dream is that people can have a decent education and a chance to do good things with their knowledge like I try to do. As John Dewey would say: “Education is not the preparation for life, education is life itself”.

Camila Lima de Souza Carvalho
Hey! I'm Camila, a biochemical engineering student! I've always loved biochemistry even when I did not know what was biology or chemistry. This curiosity had always pushed me up. Some years later, I'm still the young girl trying to figure out how things work and how can I make it better. My best wish is to help people find what they love and inspire them to go on for it!
