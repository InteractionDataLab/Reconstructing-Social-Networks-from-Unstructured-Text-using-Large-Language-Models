Project Support and Advice
Prof Fernando Segato has supported us since attending on iGEM was just a dream. He helped us all the way, giving advice throughout the project's development and with all the material and lab support we needed.
Thanks to Prof Felix Monteiro for helping with our project's modeling, mentoring in all the steps necessary to achieve our wished model. Also, Prof André Ferraz gave a lot of support sharing his experience with laccase enzymes, helping with any supplies we needed and with advices on how to proceed.
At last, we want to thank our instructor Hemerson Sulpicio Junior, who helped us with insights and advices on the project.
Lab support
We’d like to thank all the support given by the Synthetic and Molecular Biology Lab people: Awana Lima, Bianca Oliva and Gislene Ferreira. Specially, we’d like to thank our instructor Josman Velasco and our advisors Evandro Mullinari and Aline Gonçalves, who helped us in practically every step of our lab work development.
Thanks to Prof Valdeir Arantes, Prof Rita Rodrigues and Prof Adriane Ferreira for letting us use their lab when necessary. Also, we want to thank the support received from the people in these labs. We’d like to specially thank Patricia Quintero and Bárbara Pereira for their help.
Fundraising
A special thanks to EEL’s director Prof Renato Figueiredo Jardim, with whose support we were able to gain enough funds to attend on iGEM. Also, we’d like to thank Rodolfo Antonio, who helped with our crowdfunding, handling with all necessary paperwork process.
Human practices
For the Human Practices our team is very grateful for the whole Synthetic Biology Club members for been present and helping all our events to come true!
Special thanks to the Prefecture of Lorena and Secretary of Culture that let our team go to the main town public square for many of our HP actions.
Gustavo Jorge Paulo, our team member, as an alumnus from AIESEC could contact the Local Committee President (LCP) Thamires Barcelos from AIESEC and made one of our HP events possible. We like to thank all the members involved, the exchangers and the volunteers from the NGO AMMA.
We also would like to thank SABESP company and its employees Thais Bangoin de Oliveira and Gustavo de Souza Pereira, that made possible the visitation to Lorena’s wastewater treatment plant and taught us more about water treatment, so we could discuss it with Lorena’s population is the public square event.
Thanks to the USP-EEL Feminist Collective Enedina Alves Marques that opened space for us on a discussion about contraceptive awareness.
We are grateful for UNIFATEA that gave us space to make the yogurt day with their kids, so we could talk about microorganisms and teach them a little of cooking.
Thanks to CAEB (Academic Organization of the Biochemical Engineering Students) and CAEQ (Academic Organization of the Chemical Engineering Students) from EEL-USP that gave the opportunity for us to attend on their events.
Also, we want to thank Hack Atomic, Hardware Livre and Synbio Brasil for helping on our event: Just Build it.
Wiki
In this wiki all members were involved, but we leave a special thanks to those who dedicated lot of their time to write and design the wiki.  Our team member, Pedro Henrique Martins was the responsible for all the coding and, with his work, our wiki is the way you see. Taise Schraier de Quadros elaborated all the design and did some amazing art work. Jack Li Jun and Marcus Vinicius Nascimento wrote and translated many of or texts.
CBSin members Junyelle Carolina Pereira and Jean Lucas Ribeiro also helped writing our wiki. At last, we need to thank Rick Li for the help on the caption of our videos,  and Ana Carolina Suzuki and Sabryne Rodrigues for the awesome photos they took for us.
Modeling
Thanks to our teammate Camila Lima, that dedicated all her free time in doing our Modeling. There wasn’t neither vacations nor holidays for this little girl until she was sure she made her best at it!
LabWork and Interlab
Of course, other members from team could learn a little more about Synthetic Biology laboratory, however our members that were more committed to the Labwork and to the InterLab were Paulo Pereira Sforsin, Cibele Zolnier and Fernando Satoshi Tutihashi.
The last one, Fernando, was essential for all the procedures, once he had previous experience on a molecular biology lab and shared all his knowledge with us. So here is a special thanks for this crew for not skipping any lab days and making our project true!
Team and project logo
We need to thank Jean Lucas Ribeiro that made our LACQUASE beautiful logo. Also, our pretty scientist mammoth logo was result of the art work of our team member Camila Lima.
Project start
Every team has its own start and ours was thanks to André Hermann. He was the one that idealized CBSin and formed the first iGEM team from EEL, USP-EEL-Brazil 2016. It’s his and E. coil team’s steps we follow and without them, we wouldn’t be where we stand today.
We cannot forget to thank the responsible for our 2018’s project first idea, Cibele Zolnier. It was her efforts and determination that made our LACQUASE project real.
Acknowledgements
Our team received some punctual help from other people and they also need our gratitude. Prof Wothan Tavares de Lima, from ICB-USP, and Andrea Cassia Pereira Sforsin helped us with reagents for our characterization. Also, we are thankful for the attention and availability of the Uniscience scientific advisor Flávia de Toledo Frias, who helped us with a lot of materials.
