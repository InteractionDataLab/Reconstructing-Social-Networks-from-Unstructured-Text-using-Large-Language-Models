Bronze
Registration and Giant Jamboree Attendance
Our team is registered in iGEM. We had a great time during this year, preparing for the competition, and canâ€™t wait to attend the Giant Jamboree.
Competition Deliverables
We successfully created our team wiki, poster, and presentation to be ready for the Giant Jamboree. We completed the safety and judging forms, and sent the DNA samples of our new parts to the registry.
Attributions
We created an attribution page in our wiki, to thank all the people that were meaningful to this project.
Characterization / Contribution
We successfully participated in the Interlab Measurement study and our results were gladfully validated by iGEM HQ.
Silver
Validated Part
We added new BioBricks , which we used in the main modules of our project.
Collaborations
We collaborated with teams from all around the world, talking to teams from all the continents.
Human Practices
As our Human Practices , we successfully organized several activities to spread our love for science.
Gold
Integrated Human Practices
The Human Practices were fundamental in the direction of the theoretical and experimental design of the project.
Improve a Previous Part or Project
The part BBa_K2761010 is an improvement of previous research in DNA recording of information.
Model Your Project
Our team has succesfully created a mathematical model that describes our project. This model was a great influence in our project, by dictating the experimental path we had to take. It was really important for the theoretical predictions, thus describing the general behavior of our system.
Demonstrate yout work
The project works under realistic conditions and is supported by a strong theoretical framework.
