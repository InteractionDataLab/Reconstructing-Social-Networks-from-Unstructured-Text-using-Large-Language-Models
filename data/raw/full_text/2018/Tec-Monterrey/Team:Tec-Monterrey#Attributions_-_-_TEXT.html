No great project is done without help
What we have done
Since 2017, the whole iGEM Tec-Monterrey team has been working on all other aspects left out of these attributions, including brainstorming the concept idea based on previous research, conducting lab work and purchasing equipment and materials, among many other important tasks. Without further ado, we would like to mention all the incredible people that are responsible for the success of this project.
General Support
Project Support and Advice
Luis Mario Leal: For constantly supporting the team in about every single aspect since the beginning of the formation of the group . The project wouldn't have been the same without him. We are especially grateful for his guidance on the development of the different competition parameters and the selection of our project’s topic and design of most important constructs, the commitment, and responsibility towards our team and for his help on the organization of the team. Also for being a leader when we faced the deepest problems in our team and helped to resolve them. Even though he had lots of professional occupations, he was always there for us. Thank you for everything Luis Mario!
Dry/Wet Lab Support
Camilo Chávez:
For helping to give direction to our team at the beginning of the project, he also trained us with the basic protocols in synthetic biology at lab. He inspired us with all his experience at iGEM and as an entrepreneur an biohacker with his enterprise Scintia. Thank you Camilo for all your advice!
James K. Nuñez:
Postdoc at UCSF in J. Weissman's lab and PhD from Doudna Lab, UC Berkeley; we had a meeting for presenting our project and doubts about his research, and also helped us sending important DNA sequence for the research purposes of this project. We are really greatful his time, kindness and patience with us.
