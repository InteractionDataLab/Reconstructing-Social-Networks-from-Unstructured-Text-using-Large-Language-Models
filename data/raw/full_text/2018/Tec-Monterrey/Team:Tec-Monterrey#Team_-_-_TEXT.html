Team Leader
Born into the deepest hoods of Torreón (La Laguna) and currently studying in Monterrey as a senior in nanotechnology engineering and chemistry science, I’m proudly participant of iGEM Tec-Monterrey team. One of my passions is science dissemination and the interdisciplinary interaction of different careers and vocations in it. My goal in life is to get the enough resources to help people to self-fulfill their dreams and to enhance their quality of life. My hobbies are: languages learning and hanging around/walking in new places. As random fact before dedicating completely to science I was a street skateboarder for around 8 years. Hope to see you at Boston soon!

Hi, Hallo, Hola! Researching, designing experiments and leading the group in lab activities were main main tasks. My passion is the biotechnology and how is it possible to used it in different areas that can impact in human life. That's why I am almost ending my bachelor degree in this area. In the team I am also known as Charlie, so if you see me I respond for both names. I live in Monterrey city since I was 5 years old. I love competitions like IGEM because they bring new ideas, new talents and young people together to develop projects of great impact in biological science and bioengineering.  I love to play tennis. This is my main hobby. I love to make new friends. Hope to see you in the competition!

Hello there ! As the main developer of this wiki, it's an honor to have you reading my description. People call me Esteban, or Steve if you want, I come from the small state of Aguascalientes, but I’ve been living in Monterrey since I was 6, and now I’m 20 years old. I love chemistry, programming, and science in general. I also love to paint digitally, draw , play videogames and hangout with friends.
My goal in life, and the reason why I love projects like iGEM, is to make science cool and accessible for everyone. This is because I believe that science itself is always benefiting Humanity. Even though some people use it wrong, the net force of science is always forward.
