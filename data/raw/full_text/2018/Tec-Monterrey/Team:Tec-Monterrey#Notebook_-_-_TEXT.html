Growth
In 200 ml of SOC
Notes: iGEM protocol says 250 ml SOB, instead 200 ml were used
There’s less overnight, so initial absorbance will be less than 0.1
 
Optical density
3:00 pm, 0.3
3:52 pm, 0.465
Note: For buffer resuspension, 20 ml were used instead of 80 ml
 
RFP transformation after 16 hours
12 hours: 1-2 colonies, low expression
16 hours: 3-4 colonies, medium expression
 
Second competents batch
Previous results were successful, so iGEM (buffer CCMB80) protocol will be repeated.
Absorbance before the first resuspension: 0.482
Resuspension in 20 ml of buffer
Absorbance after resuspension: 0.444
