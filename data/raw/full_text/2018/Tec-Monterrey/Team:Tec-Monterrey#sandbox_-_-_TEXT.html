DNA has been called an excellent medium                     for archiving data, interpreting the four base                     pairs as a new language.

Through gene induction,  bacteria could store external information in their DNA. iGEM Tec-Monterrey 2018 attempts to create a new system, which saves information regarding its surroundings.
Information storage in DNA has                     been demonstrated by recent efforts, saving anything                     from messages to animations.
E. coding composes a new mechanism for information storage.
