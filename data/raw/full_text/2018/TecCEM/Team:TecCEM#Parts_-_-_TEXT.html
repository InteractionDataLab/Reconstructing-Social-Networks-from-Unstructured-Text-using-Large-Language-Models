Overview
The main aim for our project was to produce recombinant proteins that would compose our                         scaffold to improve cell proliferation. Throughout our literary research, we came across                         scaffolds, which were the ideal support that would improve cell-cell interaction, cell                         migration, proliferation and differentiation. We approached the scaffold design with three                         different proteins, each with properties to achieve better tissue regeneration and could                         interact with each other. This meant we needed a way to produce protein overexpression in E.                         coli vectors.
In this section the description of the constructs and background behind the constructs is                         explained.
Collagen Biobrick
A collagen-like synthetic gene comprising heparin binding site of collagen type V (HepV)                             was employed. The synthetic gene for COL5A1 was optimized for codon usage in E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3), whereas illegal sequences were removed.
The nucleotide sequence of collagen is optimized for E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) and cloned                             into the backbone pSB1C3 that consists of a chloramphenicol resistant gene using EcoRI and                             PstI restriction sites, with an inducible T7-lac promoter for the construction of the                             BioBrick. The T7-lac promoter is extracted from plasmid pET-DEST42.
A nucleotide sequence encoding Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) was retrieved from iGEM                             database (BBa_K1323009) and cloned into pSB1C3 under an Anderson constitutive promoter                             (BBa_K823005) using an RFC[10] with restriction enzymes: EcoRI and PstI and used a double                             TAATAA stop codon. The resulting plasmid is referred to as pSB1C3-RFP-COLlikeHepV. To determine whether the sequence of the resulting gene would produce the same protein a                             simulation of the protein was done with I-Tasser.

Tenascin Biobrick
The TNC domain of fibronectin type III-like repeats (TNCIII), specifically the subdomain                             TNCIII5 has the responsibility of the binding with heparin. This binding between heparin                             and tenascin is involved in affinity with many growth factors, specifically with Fibroblast                             Growth Factor (FGF).
The nucleotide sequence of TNCIII5 is optimized for E. coli BL21 DE3 and cloned into the                             backbone (pSB1C3) using EcoRI and PstI restriction sites, with an inducible T7-lac promoter                             and rrnB-T1 terminator using RFC[10]. The domain was expressed by bacterial expression as                             GST fusion protein and use C-terminal HIS tag. The fusion protein GST was used for the                             stability of the domain.
A polyproline linker was used between the TCDIII5 domain and GST in order to conserve the                             three-dimensional structure of the full protein and then a protein simulation was done                             using I-Tasser simulator.

Leptin Biobrick
Leptin is a growth factor and is the main protein that helps in this project for skin                             regeneration. This is going to be encapsulated by chitosan and bound to the scaffold                             composed by Tenascin, collagen, and heparin. Leptin protein is the product of the ob gene                             and it is found in adipocytes cells.
The coding sequence is optimized for Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and cloned in a pSB1C3                             plasmid. To get the cloned sequence is necessary the implementation of EcoRI and PstI                             restriction sites, that they are located in the prefix and suffix, respectively, previously                             sintetized for the coding leptin sequence. In addition, the sequence part has an inducible                             T7-lac promoter (BBa_R0184 → BBa_K2406020) and a double terminator (B0010-B0012 →                             BBa_B0015) rrnBT1-T7TE from E. coli using RFC[10]. For its purification was used a                             C-terminal HIS tag.
A simulation in I-Tasser was used to prove the stability of the protein and also, to                             observe the interaction of Leptin with chitosan, was necessary the implementation of the                             math model created by the iGEM-TEC CEM team.
