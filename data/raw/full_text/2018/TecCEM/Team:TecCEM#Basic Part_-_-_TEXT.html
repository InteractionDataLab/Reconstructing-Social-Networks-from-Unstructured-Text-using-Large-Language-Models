BBa_K2719000 : GST Coding                         site
Glutathione S-transferase (GST) is a peptide derived from Schistosoma japonicum, in which a                         target                         protein may be fused on the N-terminal. This fusion allows the purification of the target                         protein using                         glutathione affinity and maximize the presence of the protein in soluble state, rather than on                         inclusion bodies. This tag may be later removed by adding a protease recognition site between                         GST and                         the target protein (Harper & Speicher, 2013).

BBa_K2719001 : Tenascin                         Domain V
Tenascin is a human protein that is involved in tissue regeneration processes. The domain V                         contains                         heparin binding sites that are fundamental for our scaffold.                         Also contains multiple growth factor binding sites and, even when we are only working with                         leptin is                         important because it would help in the improvement of tissue regeneration. In addition, it has                         been                         reported that it participated stem cells signalling.

BBa_K2719002 : GST-Tenascin                         Domain V Fusion Protein
This part is the fusion between both proteins and that helps us to simplify tenascin                         purification. GST                         has tenascin fused on the N-terminal. For more information see BBa_K2719001 and BBa_K2719003.

GST coding sequence (see part BBa_K2719000) with codon optimization for E.coli BL21 (DE3) to                         avoid                         complications in the production of this recombinant protein.

Coding sequence from tenascin fibronectin domains I-V have the property of interacting with the                         proliferation of fibroblast, but the domain with the main characteristic previously mentioned                         is domain                         V (see part BBa_K2719001).

BBa_K2719006 : Collagen V-                         like                         protein coding                         site
Collagen V is one of the main proteins involved in the extracellular matrix, thus it would be                         important in the structure of our scaffold. The main challenge for producing recombinant collagen V is                         that for                         its correct structure it requires post-traductional modifications, specially the hydroxylation                         of                         proline. To overcome this challenge, we designed this part to incorporate hydroxyproline, a                         non-canonical amino acid. For its proper incorporation, this part is optimized for its use on E.coli Rosetta (DE3).

BBa_K2719008 : Leptin coding                         site.
This is one of the most important parts because is the growth factor that we are using for                         accelerating                         the process of skin regeneration. Is a protein that is found in adipocytes cells on many living                         beings                         and it has been discovered that it has a regenerating property, because it has been found in                         many wound                         repair processes. It has been shown that it increases glucose intake speeding up metabolism,                         thus,                         accelerating cell proliferation.
