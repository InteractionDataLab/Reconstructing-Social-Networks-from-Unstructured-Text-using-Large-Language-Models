BBa_K2719005 : Tenascin                         Domain V Expression device
Tenascin was modified and optimized for Escherichia coli BL21-DE3 in order to be detected                         and                         processed by this strain. In addition, a GTS protein was fusionated to tenascine by a                         polylinker to conserve the three dimensional structure, because GST provides stability to the                         Tenascin domain and, also, is a protein that was useful for purification in the case HIS tag                         doesnâ€™t worked well. This part contain a T7-lac promoter ( BBa_R0184 ),                         and RBS ( BBa_J61100 ) and                         a rrnB-T1 terminator ( BBa_B0015 ) using RFC10                         assembly standard, thus containing the standard                         BioBrick prefix and suffix.

BBa_K2719007 : Collagen                         V - like Expression device
Collagen is optimized for Escherichia coli Rosetta 2-DE3 because it was the only strain modified                         for the detection of non-canonical amino acids. In this case, collagen has a non-canonical                         amino acid, specifically Hydroxyproline, in order to obtain a correctly binding between                         collagen and heparin. This protein was also cloned in pSB1C3 and in it, additionally, was                         cloned a Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) to prove that the expression of collagen is taking place                         in the bacteria. This part contain a T7-lac promoter ( BBa_R0184 ),                         and RBS ( BBa_J61100 ) and a                         double TAATAA terminator ( BBa_B0015 ). The                         prefix and suffix of every part were based on                         BioBrick RFC10.

BBa_K2719009 : Leptin                         expression device
This part is designed for the expression of leptin in E.coli BL21 (DE3), for that function it                         consists on a T7-lac promoter ( BBa_R0184 ),                         RBS ( BBa_J61100 ), the leptin coding site                         ( BBa_K2719008 ) and a double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ). This part was synthetized and                         the sequence                         was designed using the standard BioBrick assembly, therefore it has the BioBrick suffix and                         prefix. This part allows for an inducible expression of recombinant leptin.

BBa_K2719010 : Leptin                         coding device with blue chrome protein
This part facilitates the selection of transformed colonies for the production of leptin                         ( BBa_K2719009 ) by the incorporation of a                         reporter cassette ( BBa_K592015 ), which                         constitutively                         expresses blue chrome protein. This reporter simplifies the selection of colonies by the                         appearance of blue colored colonies, serving as transformation and ligation control.

BBa_K2719011 : Collagen                         coding device with blue chromoprotein
This part facilitates the selection of transformed colonies for the production of collagen                         ( BBa_K2719007 ) by the incorporation of a                         reporter cassette ( BBa_K592015 ), which                         constitutively                         expresses blue chrome protein. This reporter simplifies the selection of colonies by the                         appearance of blue colored colonies, serving as transformation and ligation control. This part                         has both reporter genes, RFP ( BBa_I13521 )                         and Blue chromoprotein, so it could be easier to detect and select colonies of our interest.

Combined reporter basic model, this part incorporates a constitutively expressed blue                         chromoprotein cassette ( BBa_K592015 ) and a                         Tet repressible RFP expression cassette                         ( BBa_I13521 ). This part serves as a model                         for the development of multiple reporter systems and                         how a colony would look when there are multiple reporter proteins and expressed or repressed at                         the same time. This part improves the understanding of multiple reporter systems and the                         interactions of two reporter proteins, letting to the understanding of the observations of                         those systems. Also, was made as a control for collagen ( BBa_K2719011 )                         that has the two                         reporter genes.
