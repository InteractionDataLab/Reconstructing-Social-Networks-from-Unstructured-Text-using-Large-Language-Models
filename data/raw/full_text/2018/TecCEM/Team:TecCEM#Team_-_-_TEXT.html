iGEM TecCEM 2018 has the honor to present its team of sixteen undergrad students. It is a                 team of engineering students between 19 and 23 years old who live in the State of Mexico. All the                 members are extremely responsible, persevering and they are united by their passion and love for science. Each member compliments and enriches the team in different areas. They pursue the common goal                 of transcending through science and leaving a legacy that contributes to the progress of society and                 the improvement of human well-being.
