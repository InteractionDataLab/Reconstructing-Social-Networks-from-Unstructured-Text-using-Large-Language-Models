Each great discovery in the world of science is not the achievement of only one person, in                 fact, it is the accomplishment of the researchers and the teachers and collaborators that were with                 them throughout the development of the project. In TecTissue, a family was born, and they helped us to                 succeed and search a novel treatment for people who have suffered from burns. Therefore, we want to                 thank:
Ph.D. Aurora Antonio Pérez who worked with us in recombinant proteins, structures                 prediction, expression, and purification.
Thank you for taking the time to explain to us and guide us all the way.
Ramon Rivero Aranda the lab technician of Microbiology, that lived with us through our                 everyday stress and anguish but always supporting us.
Thank you for your patience.
Jesús Enrique Chong who worked with us in the automatization of the hardware and all                 the circuits involved.
Thank you for teaching us.
Paola Andrea Mora Gazano the lab technician of Experimental Chemist, that gave us                 material and remembered us to eat when we looked starved.
Thank you for caring.
Roberto Delgado Duran our other lab technician thank you for opening the lab early for                 us and for giving us the necessary materials for our experiments.
Thank you for your time.
Christian Zaragoza Pérez the other lab technician of Experimental Chemist that always                 opened the lab for us when Robert ran late.
Thank you for your help.
Yamir Bandala Solano who worked with us in the nanoencapsulation of chitosan and helped                 us predicting all the intermolecular interactions involved in it. He also helped us with the                 crosslinking of the scaffold.
Thank you for all the knowledge.
Manuel Jaime Rodriguez who helped us acquiring the cell lines and teaching us the                 protocols involved in the caring of the cell lines.
Thank you, the cell line was a very important part of our project, without it we could not prove                     that our treatment works.
Josefina Castillo Reyna & Andrés David García García who helped us with the lab access,                 the management and the resources for the project.
Thank you for the support.
Ph.D. José Bustos & Ph.D. Atzin Robles Contreras they let us save our cell lines in                 their lab's incubators when our CO2 ran out.
You were lifesavers, literally.
Ph.D. Dulce Viridiana Melo Maximo for lending us some of her PDMS and showing us how to                 prepare it and use it.
Thank you, it was very importanat for our hardware.
Ph.D. José Luis Flores Sevilla for giving us all the support in our project and for                 sponsoring our project.
Thank you for searching how to cure burns.
Ph.D. Edgar Oliver López Villegas in the use of TEM for the visualization of the                 nanocapsules of chitosan. .
Thank you for your time.
Ph.D. Maykel González for his feedback in nanoencapsulation of chitosan.
Thank you for making our project better.
MSC Oscar Rodríguez Espinosa for helping in the scanning microscope in order for us to                 see the nanocapsules of chitosan.
Thank you.
Carlos Uriel Ibarra Navarrete for helping us developing the mechanics inside the                 Hardware.
Thank you for being there for us.
Emmanuel Zamudio Reyes for helping us developing the automatization inside the                 Hardware.
Thank you for motivating us.
Gerardo Manuel García Lozano & Beatriz Hernandez the founders of Rino-Q, which receive                 us with great delight in San Luis Potosí and show us the actual problem of burns in Mexico.
Thank you for the motivation.
Jaime Rodriguez Hernandes & Astid Alicia Vela Plata for helping us in the recording and                 editing of the songs "Labs like you" and "Moves like iGEM".
Thank you for your time.
Last but not least, all the people that have supported us, the students that participate in our funding                 activities and the other ones that kindly donated money to us.
But most importantly, thanks to our families, for believing in us and giving us the                 chance of following our dreams.
Dear coffee: Thank you for being there for us all the way throughout the project.
Thank you.
