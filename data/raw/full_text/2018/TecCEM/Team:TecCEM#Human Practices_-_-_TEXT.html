Rino-Q.
From the beginning, we knew that we wanted to develop a project that had a great                         positive impact in Mexico and                         all around the world. Keeping this aim in mind, we decided to analyze some of the issues that                         our society                         faces. After brainstorming and trying to identify the most relevant aspects of each proposal,                         we all agreed                         that burn injuries, representing the third cause of infant mortality in Mexico, was an issue                         begging to be                         worked out. In the first place, burn injuries embodied a challenge beyond the instant menace to                         health. The                         complexity of the concern lies in the complications it causes not only for the victim but for                         the people around                         them. Even though we were not fully aware of the consequences that arise from a burn injury, we                         presumed that                         the risk of infection, complications, physical and psychological aftermath, cost of treatment,                         among others,                         were some of the aspects in which our project could intervene.                         Looking back to the first moments of TecTissue, we can tell that the project has evolved thanks                         to all the                         people who enriched our perspective and broadened our panorama to consider some aspects that,                         otherwise, we                         would never have thought of. It was then that we realized of the importance of integrated human                         practices; in                         short, they made us understand that Tec Tissue was no longer a project for a competition but                         the hope of                         thousands of people who believe in us.

Development of new drugs for wound healing conference by PhD. Gerardo Leyva Gómez from                                 the faculty of                                 chemistry, UNAM.
We attended a lecture about the applications of novel polymers in skin regeneration,                                 which was given by Gerardo                                 Leyva Gómez, who has a Ph.D. in chemistry by the UNAM and with experience in the field                                 of therapeutics. We                                 discussed several doubts regarding our project’s scaffold and obtained valuable                                 information for the development                                 of it. It made us realize about key factors such as pore size, applications of                                 nano-encapsulation for skin                                 regeneration and experimental techniques for characterization of the scaffold, among                                 others.                                 This conference helped us to completely create a notion about the necessary parameters                                 for the design of our                                 scaffold.

LEI Course.
We had the opportunity to have a course of the appropriate techniques for cell culture                                 and ISO                                 9001 norms. The                                 course was imparted by the biotechnology engineer Manuel Jaime Rodriguez from the                                 Specialized                                 Immunologic                                 Laboratories. We obtained valuable information the first day of ISO 9001 norm that                                 helped us to                                 have a good                                 register of our reactants and equipment using a binnacle. The next day we were taught                                 the                                 aseptic technique and how to take care of the cell lines. This course helped us to have a strict order and                                 program to                                 archive our                                 aims and to know exactly how can we do cell line essays, without risk of contamination.

The objective of our project is to aid people that have suffered from burn injuries and                                 during                                 the process,                                 doctors have helped us with the understanding of the medicine involved. That's why we                                 visited                                 the physician                                 Ph.D. Fernando Osobampo, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon who treats burned people                                 in the                                 Traumatology and                                 Orthopedics Hospital and also Ph.D. Pablo Rodriguez Ferreyra, which is in charge of                                 Burnings                                 Unit of General                                 Hospital of Toluca. We presented them our project and got some feedback with the                                 purpose of                                 improving it. Being                                 plastic surgeons have given them an up-close approach. They know about the pain that                                 patients                                 experience during                                 his healing process. With this in mind, they gave us some advice on the best                                 application                                 method, focusing on                                 the growth factor concentration to induce the correct proliferation and the way of                                 administration.                                 They informed us about the main problems in patients besides the pain. One is that the                                 treatment is very                                 expensive due that recovery requires a lot of care, time and materials, this situation                                 often                                 gets worse and way                                 more expensive because of the lack of knowledge of the nurses attending the patients                                 properly.                                 Also, both                                 doctors shared with us the statistics of the cost of treatment and duration. Additionally, they                                 suggested                                 focussing in just one kind of injury, in order to have better results.                                 Finally, Ph.D. Osabampo & Ph.D. Pablo Rodríguez gave us his approval and congratulated                                 us                                 because of the impact                                 this project could have on the life of the patients.                                 Thanks to the meetings, we decided to focus on second-degree burns, reduce the leptin                                 concentration and the way                                 of administration to be topical.

This activity can be seen on the collaborations page. This event helped each assistant                                 team to                                 obtain feedback                                 from experts to improve our projects. In our case, it made us define exactly the type                                 of burn                                 we wanted to                                 treat and to reject some bad approaches we thought could solve the problem.

Rino-Q.
On July, 5th, and 6th, we had the opportunity to visit Rino-Q, which stands for                                 “Integral Rescue                                 of the Burnt                                 Child” in Spanish. It is a foundation in charge of the overall rehabilitation of kids                                 and                                 adults who have                                 suffered burns. We had to book a hotel since we come from the State of Mexico and                                 traveled to                                 San Luis Potosi.                                 We arrived and got a brief tour of the facilities. After that, we had a meaningful                                 conversation                                 with the                                 director of the foundation, Gerardo Manuel García Lozano and his wife, Beatriz Eugenia                                 Hernández Contreras.                                 They explained to us the complications of treating with burned people as well as the                                 costs it                                 implied. One of                                 the most important aspects to consider when addressing the problem is the amount of                                 time                                 patients remain                                 hospitalized due to their burns. This represents one of the main opportunities for our                                 project.                                 The next day we taught a group of kids who were part of the foundation about synthetic                                 biology                                 and prepared                                 some activities to reinforce what they learned through games and interactive dynamics.                                 In the                                 end, we                                 approached the parents and families of the kids so that they could talk about their                                 experiences                                 and                                 testimonies. After the visit, we realized that, in addition to the statistics and                                 technical                                 information                                 regarding burned people and their treatment, we have a moral commitment with the kids                                 and                                 society in general                                 because we have the possibility and therefore the duty to help.
