                This type of injuries is the third cause of infant mortality in our country, this is an important issue that has to be solved. This project approaches that problem with the design of a
                multi-glycopeptide scaffold and the recombinant growth factor Leptin B to induce fibroblast proliferation. Nanoencapsulation was employed to ensure proper delivery and distribution. Growth measurements were evaluated through cell image analysis and lactate dehydrogenase activity as an indirect indicator,  this results were obtained from the culture medium in the MiniSkin Simulator. The Miniskin simulator is a hardware that tests molecules in a 3D culture. This system could potentially enhance tissue regeneration, minimizing infection
                risks and treatment periods for affected patients with second-degree burns.</P><DIV class="row" id="background"><DIV class="col"><H1>Background</H1><P>All over the globe, burn injuries are a huge problem in the health sector, as previously mentioned it represents the third
                        cause of infant mortality in Mexico and around 120 thousand people per year suffer a burn injury accident, based in the public health sector information. However, Mexico doesn't have the required infrastructure to treat third-degree burns, which causes a high mortality rate (NTX, 2017).
                    </P><P>
                        Furthermore, the rate of child mortality from burn injuries is 7 times higher in areas with low socioeconomic income. Each burn injury case could hit a cost of 141,750 USD due to the lack of specialized equipment and staff required to attend these delicate wounds.
                        This problem has been ignored due to the following implications: healing process, high costs and the 
                        difficulties providing the specialized treatment. We concluded that accelerating this
                        the process would have many advantages, not only in a faster skin regeneration but also it would
                        have a psychological impact and reduce the economic cost.
                    </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" id="solution"><DIV class="col"><H1>The solution</H1><P>Thus, we created TecTissue, a novel treatment that is capable of reducing wound healing time,
                        preventing infections and consequently, decreasing mortality rate. We achieved this with synthetic biology, incorporating a growth factor and a scaffold.
                    </P><P>
                        TecTissueâ€™s main objective is to provide families with a simple way solution that will help in the reduction of
                        medical bills and hospitalization time, making the recovery process easier and also creating a
                        chance of better life quality for the people that suffered from burn injuries.
                        We used recombinant proteins like collagen, composed by non-canonical amino acids. We also implemented a growth factor produced by humans called Leptin. This growth factor has been reported to be essential in different skin regeneration processes. There were some other molecules used in our project such as tenascin and heparin. Both of them, bonded with
                        collagen, make part of our scaffold which is encapsulated with leptin in nanoparticles of chitosan,
                        in order to have an efficient delivery in the skin.
                    </P><P>We tested the development of TecTissue in fibroblast cell line L-929 and human mesenchymal
                        cells. To demonstrate our project it was necessary to elaborate a Mini Skin Simulator were the cell lines were provided with the conditions they required in order to get a positive proliferation. This Mini Skin Simulator was automatized to create a friendly device for the
                        manipulation of cells in a culture and to reduce the possible contamination.

                        function. Furthermore, proline hydroxylation plays a crucial role by providing the triple helix
                        with improved thermostability and structural integrity. Despite, with a specific set of
                        conditions, exogenous Hyp has been shown to be activated by Pro-tRNA synthetase when supplied

                        disulfide-bonded hexabrachion[xexe]. This protein has a positive regulation in the regeneration
                        and
                        tissue remodeling, playing an important role in the regulation of this process. The TNC
                        presence stimulates the migration of fibroblasts, furthermore inhibits the contraction of the
                        fibrin-fibronectin matrix in order to prevent the premature contraction of the matrix before
                        the adequate deposition of collagen. The third domain of TNC consists of a series of up to 15
                        fibronectin type III-like repeats (TNCIII)[xixi]. The subdomain TNCIII5 has the responsibility
                        of the
                        binding with heparin. The binding between heparin and tenascin is involved in affinity with
                        many growth factors, specifically with Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) as well as TGF-Î² and
                        IGF-BP. The high affinity of TNC for an extensive range of growth factors is mediated mainly by
                        the TNCIII5 domain and that, despite being a high-end affinity, a promiscuous binding
                        occurs[xoxo].</P><FIGURE class="figure text-center"><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption"><STRONG>Figure 3.

                            Kunjanchan and Lammers, 2010). For CS to be employed as a delivery vehicle low isoelectric
                            value proteins are better encapsulated at a pH greater than the pI value (pH&gt;pI), this is
                            because of the electrostatic interactions. (Quan and Wang, 2007) Nanoparticle formation is
                            favored by CS ability to bind to polyanions due to the formation of complexes between both
                            oppositely charged entities. The polyanion we chose to work with was sodium
