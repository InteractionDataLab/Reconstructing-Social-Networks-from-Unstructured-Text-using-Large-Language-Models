Improvement of nanoencapsulation protocol with low molecular weight chitosan and sodium                 tripolyphosphate (TPP)
The main objective of nanoencapsulation was to create an efficient vehicle for protein delivery. In                 order to attain this, we applied the nanoencapsulation protocol from iGEM TAS Taipei 2016 and produced                 a smaller nanoparticle with an approximate size of ~27 nm. The creation of smaller particles yields a                 higher internalization rate of several drugs, which acts inside the cell, rather than on the surface                 receptors, small nanoparticles ( < 39 nm) are able to pass through the nuclear pore complexes via                 passive                 diffusion and have a higher endocytosis rate. Nuclear target nanoparticles are an example of such a                 design. (Tamman, 2015)
We assessed the fact that during encapsulation pH may need a                 modification to optimize the interaction between chitosan and proteins, shifting the encapsulation                 efficiency. A troubleshoot was applied for this protocol to work better with any protein, as pH 5.5                 is not a universal ideal condition. The reason behind this is that chitosan is positively charged                 when dissolved in an acidic environment, and proteins with low isoelectric value are better                 encapsulated at a pH greater than the pI value, favoring the interaction between negatively charged                 proteins and chitosan. Therefore, before encapsulating any protein, the pI has to be consulted to                 adjust the chitosan solution pH, so that pI < pH < 6.5 as an ideal condition, though not all                 proteins                 will meet such constraint (Gan and Wang, 2007). Our improvement proposal is demonstrated by the                 encapsulation of a standard protein that meets this suggested condition.
The employed red                 fluorescent protein (BBa_J04450) has an isoelectric point of around 5.6.                 The characterization of RFP encapsulation was made under the following conditions as stated by                 TAS Taipei 2016: pH of 4 to avoid chitosan aggregation and solution concentrations of 3 mg/mL                 chitosan and 1 mg/mL TPP. This resulted in an encapsulation with an average size of ~27 nm.                 Like proposed by team TAS Taipei 2016, RFP encapsulation was verified by centrifugation of                 particle suspension and UV irradiation of the formed pellet.

We performed a particle analysis in NanoSight NS300 to obtain the particle size distribution. A dot                 graph for a triplicate analysis is presented below.

The particle sizes obtained from NanoSight NS300 differ from those observed by transmission                         electron microscopy (TEM), but we hypothesize this discrepancy is caused by particle                         conglomeration rather than different particle sizes. Water at pH 7.4 was the solvent in which                         particles were resuspended for the NS300 analysis, while samples were treated beforehand for                         the observation in TEM. This treatment helps to enable a clear observation of individual                         nanoparticles. This effect may not be reached in an environment like an aqueous solution.

To proof the possibility of modifying chitosan solution pH, an encapsulation procedure was                         carried out using bovine serum albumin (BSA). BSA has a pI ranging from 4.7 to 4.9 as chitosan                         is soluble in acidic environments while acquiring a positive net charge. By adjusting the pH to                         5.5 BSA charges become negative, improving the interaction with chitosan. Encapsulation                         efficiency may be optimized with this adjustments.
The standard curve was derived with the Bradford assay to determine the concentrations of free                         protein in the supernatant after encapsulation and centrifugation.

Encapsulation efficiency was then determined from:
The resulting efficiency for BSA loaded nanoparticles was 42% from a four encapsulation sample                         assay. BSA has a molecular weight (MW) of 66.5 kDa and a pI of 4.6. As it has been proved,                         encapsulation efficiency increases with decreasing MW. Though BSA has a high MW, the pI < pH                         effect generates a high-efficiency percentage according to literature. (Jarudilokkul, 2011)
Chromoproteins
In many systems for the control of cloning and transformation reporter protein are used, but                         what happens when two different reporter proteins are cloned in the same vector and expressed                         at the same time? That is what here wanted to answer by fusioning two reporter cassettes. In                         this case a constitutive blue chromoprotein and a repressible Red Fluorescent Protein were                         cloned in a pSB1C3 plasmid to observe how both reporters interact and if our hypothesis of                         obtaining a purple color would be true.                         To prove this idea, after the ligation of the both parts with the plasmid, previously                         mentioned, this complex needs to be transformed into an appropriate Escherichia coli strain and                         then, the coloration of the colonies has to be measured.
Another experiment was the repression of Red Fluorescent Protein to prove the expression of                         Blue Chromoprotein one. This kind of system allows the design of complex multiple reporter                         proteins to simplify the selection process and developed stronger controls during the creation                         of synthetic biology projects.
