Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E. coli cultures
Synthetic biology and all the engineering disciplines need to be reliable and repeatable, this                         year                         iGEM TecCEM 2018 is one of the teams that participated in the Fifth International                         InterLaboratory                         Measurement Study. In this page, we report the results obtained during all protocols.
Competent cell - transformation DH5-alpha
Transformations of all devices were performed, and the resulting transformant strains were                         plated on LB                         agar, with 35 μg/mL chloramphenicol. Two colonies per plate were separated into two independent                         cultures.
Verification
We verified the presence and size of the device plasmids in the transformant strains by running                         an agarose gel electrophoresis.

Calibration Protocol
The main objective of this calibration LUDOX protocol is to use LUDOX CL-X to get the                         conversion factor                         between absorbance (Abs 600) from the plate reader and the OD600 measurement.

Particle standard curve - Microsphere Protocol
The aim of this protocol is to establish a standard curve from a microsphere solution. These                         microspheres have similar size and optic properties to bacterial cells, therefore, they may be                         used to                         calibrate.
After preparing the Microsphere Stock Solution, serial dilutions were made in a 96-well plate                         as                         instructed. To achieve reliable results, the plate reader was set to shake the samples just                         before                         reading them. The reads were registered in the given Excel file and are shown below.

Fluorescence standard curve - Fluorescein Protocol
Following the protocol for the fluorescence standard curve using fluorescein, we prepared the                         corresponding reactants and the requested serial solutions in the 96-well plate.

After performing all three calibration measurements, we proceeded to execute the cell                         measurement                         protocol, previously having the overnight cell culture of each device and control. We use the                         same                         plate and volume that we used in the calibration protocol, also the same settings in order to                         make                         valid the measurement.
We defined the difference between the measurement of the absorbance and fluorescence, starting                         in the hour 0 until the hour 6.
Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E. coli cultures
To preparing the starting samples we diluted overnight cultures of both positive and negative                         controls                         to the linear detection range of the plate reader. A duplicate of each culture was placed on                         the                         96-well plate, as well as a blank. After measuring absorbance, cultures were diluted further to                         reach                         an OD600=0.1. A triplicate of each dilution was placed as instructed. The absorbance                         measurements were                         confirmed and used to prepare the respective dilutions for 12 starting samples at 0.1, six for                         each                         control.                         We diluted the cultures to a final OD600 of 0.1 and performed serial dilutions by                         transferring                         100 μL                         to the next tube. The dilutions 3, 4, and 5 were used to spread 100 μL in LB+Cam plates. After                         an                         overnight incubation, we counted the colonies in each of the plates, being many of them                         uncountable.                         The counted colonies are shown below.

Conclusion
Devices 2 and positive control exhibited a slow growth rate, hence, we had issues when waiting for cultures to reach a desired absorbance, as they became out of phase. Several teams we contacted had experienced similar situations. Despite that, InterLab is useful tool to evaluate the reliability of the measurements performed in the laboratory. We think it represents a means to demonstrate the technical quality of team members.
