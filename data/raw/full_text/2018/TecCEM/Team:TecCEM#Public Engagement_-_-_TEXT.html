Interview for "CONECTA"
Sol of Mexico Newsletter publication
Since the beginning of the human race, we have tried to communicate our feelings,                         thoughts, and achievements. That’s why having good skills in public engagement are needed then                         and now. Therefore, in the path of developing TecTissue, we have several activities in order to                         express the main objectives of our project, the need to solve the problem of burns and also                         encourage people in the field of science.

Rino-Q.
On July, 5th, and 6th, we had the opportunity to visit Rino-Q, which stands for                         “Integral Rescue                         of the Burnt                         Child” in Spanish. It is a foundation in charge of the overall rehabilitation of kids                         and                         adults who have                         suffered burns. We had to book a hotel since we come from the State of Mexico and                         traveled to                         San Luis Potosi.                         We arrived and got a brief tour of the facilities. After that, we had a meaningful                         conversation                         with the                         director of the foundation, Gerardo Manuel García Lozano and his wife, Beatriz Eugenia                         Hernández Contreras.                         They explained to us the complications of treating with burned people as well as the                         costs it                         implied. One of                         the most important aspects to consider when addressing the problem is the amount of                         time                         patients remain hospitalized due to their burns. This represents one of the main opportunities for our                         project.                         The next day we taught a group of kids who were part of the foundation about synthetic                         biology                         and prepared                         some activities to reinforce what they learned through games and interactive dynamics.                         In the                         end, we                         approached the parents and families of the kids so that they could talk about their                         experiences                         and                         testimonies. After the visit, we realized that, in addition to the statistics and                         technical                         information                         regarding burned people and their treatment, we have a moral commitment with the kids                         and                         society in general                         because we have the possibility and therefore the duty to help.

UNIVERSUM
Day one: Mexico has a deficit in science, the government only invests 1% of the GDP in this                         sector, but the                         public has a keen interest for new technologies and the improvement of synthetic biology and                         this was an                         excellent opportunity for us to inspire the desire to learn and move towards action.                          On Saturday, July 21st we made a visit to the science museum “Universum” with the interest of                         approaching kids                         and the general public in order to teach them about the basics of synthetic biology with a                         little workshop that                         included fun activities and dynamics where everyone could participate. Most of the kids whose                         interest was                         peaked by our workshop. We welcomed with a brief explanation of molecular biology. The kids                         really showed                         enthusiasm and proceeded to do the activities we prepared for them. While the kids were playing                         and learning                         with the activities, we took a quick survey with the parents or relatives asking some questions                         regarding their                         take on burns, prevention, and treatment. The activities made in our workshop the first day                         consisted of                         teaching the kids about plasmids and bacterias with a brief introduction of how they work                         without making it too                         difficult for them. For the next day the activities that took place consisted in more didactic                         exercises to                         learn about biology and the structure of major skin cells.

The community of bioengineering students of SEBIOTEC carried out an event where representatives                         of all                         Tecnológico de Monterrey campuses attended. The main purpose of this event was to discuss                         topics of interest.                         Furthermore, these undergraduates wanted to improve an accurate communication between all the                         bioengineering                         students. TecCEM team took presence at this event showcasing the main goals of iGEM, as well as                         the primary                         objectives of the competition. A brief outline of the project showed our aim and aspirations                         for the project                         also we offered a work plan design indicating our ambitions for it. Furthermore, the value of                         hosting the Latin                         American Meet Up with all the other teams was highlighted. Contact information was provided to                         better the                         communication between the scientific mexican community that form part of the Monterrey                         Institute of Technology                         and Higher Education student body: Tec-Chihuahua, Tec-Monterrey y TecMonterrey_GDL; we also                         explained to                         non-iGEMers how the competition worked and how to kickstart their teams so they can join next                         year.
Freshmen iGEM introduction

We had a conference with 1st semester students of Biotechnology Engineering of our school,                         Tecnológico de                         Monterrey Campus Estado de México. Our goal was to explain them what is iGEM, so they would be                         even more                         interested in synthetic biology and that in some future decide to join this great iGEM                         community. We gave them                         the whole panorama of what is required to participate in the competition. Another thing we                         achieved by                         explaining the basis of our project "Tec Tissue" was to raise awareness about the problem we                         are facing through                         and with this they would be more interested in these lines of research. At the end of the                         conference the                         students were really interested IN participating in the next iGEM competitions and to learn                         more about our                         project.
Innovation week "Entrepreneur challenge"
The Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education promotes innovation among its                         students by challenging                         them to solve different issues from the real world. With this purpose, first semester students                         have to raise                         funds in one week and donate them to finance the development of projects born within the same                         institution. From                         September 24th to 28th we had the opportunity to present our project not only with students of                         the biological                         sector but all the careers offered in the Campus. However, we were not the only team                         participating for the                         donations, Tec Tissue was competing with several other projects for the funds and the                         recognition of the                         institution to participate in the most important event of The Monterrey Institute of Technology                         and Higher                         Education, the IncMonterrey, (Innovate-Network-Create), we're teams from all Monterrey                         Institute compete in one                         week to be the most innovative entrepreneur project of the year, were the first price is 1                         million pesos to                         build up an entrepreneur. And we have the amazing surprise to be one of the project with most                         support and to be                         selected to go to this event in November.
