Introduction
Cell Count
One of the crucial parts in cell culture is the determination of confluency, but with the current techniques this process is slow and imprecise. That is why we developed a software using machine learning to analyze microscope images tha throw the percentage of cell confluence. The importance of having a correctly cell confluency measurement is to avoid cell apoptosis because of the reduced space in the cases of a 80 to 100% of confluency. So, having a software that can give you a more precise result of the cell proliferation that is important to maintain your cell culture in good conditions without contamination and  an excessive proliferation in it that would induce cell dead. The manipulation of this software is easy to use for everybody because is carefully realized and automatized so its implementation has a friendly interface. This software represents a revolution in the way cell culture is managed
Cell Count
The cell count software is a beta version image processing program that takes an input image and                         outputs a close estimate of the number of cells in the picture. The main reasons of it to still                         be a beta is because we would like to return the confluence percentage, as well as perform more                         tests on the software.
This software works for two kinds of cell colonies. To use it, it is necessary to access the                         web application and go to the section of Cell Count found on the top left hand. Upload your                         picture and wait for the results.

The cell counting algorithm works as follows:

In this example, we got an approximation of 990 cells counted.

This software is planned to be a relief for a lot of researchers that make this process the hard                         way. This will optimize time, effort and resources letting the scientists do more science and                         less counting.
