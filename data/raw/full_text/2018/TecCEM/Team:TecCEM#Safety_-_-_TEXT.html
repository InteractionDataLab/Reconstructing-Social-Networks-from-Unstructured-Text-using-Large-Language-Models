Safety
Lab work and project safety have to be carefully measured and taken precariously by                 everyone                 involved                 while conducting experiments. Most precautions have to be carried out taking note of all the                 safety                 protocols concerned.
Since all our parts were designed to be specific and effective toward cell                 lines, the only                 precautions                 taken were level 1 for safety measures. All the strains used come from E. coli strain and were                 inactivated as the safety protocols indicate.

For our own safety, prior to beginning any lab work, a brief introduction to all the safety                 protocols                 was given. A quick course of lab equipment manipulation and lab responsibility was taken by all                 the                 team members, helping to give a brief introduction to working in a lab for those that hadn’t                 worked                 before in one and as a reinforcement for the others.
As a level 1 in biosafety, the right safety protocols were learned and revised. This was done to                 assure                 that the right decontamination and disposal of materials were being carried out, the right                 protective                 equipment was being used and all the standard lab rules were being followed as indicated by our                 laboratory technicians.
Our laboratory has the standard safety equipment such as emergency showers, eyewash, fire                 detectors,                 fire extinguisher, security sheets, waste disposal, autoclaving, laminar flux bells, and glove                 dispenser. We always made sure to wear the right lab equipment such as lab coats, glasses,                 closed                 shoes, gloves, the right clothing, and tied hair.
Protecting the environment protocols
We have a responsibility to take care of the environment. For our experiments, the use of                 antibiotics                 for selection had to be carefully disposed of with the right protocols.
Some of the antibiotics used were: kanamycin and chloramphenicol. The safety sheet for                 chloramphenicol                 these compound can cause respiratory problems, it’s hazardous for ingestion and causes germ                 cell                 mutagenicity, reproductive toxicity and aspiration hazard all of level 1 category.
