BoB is a novel gadget with the potential of replacing classic cell culture well                         plates as scientists’ choice for executing tests of their pharmaceutical products or model                         diseases on 2D/3D cell cultures. Its automated sterile system facilitates the doing and                         tracking of tests, which result on a standardized and more precise process that will permit us                         to improve the quality and predict the time of cell proliferation and                         morfological/physiological changes in situ. The material of which it is made of will provide                         the opportunity for it to be an ecofriendly solution as it can be depyrogenated and sterilized                         for it to be used several times. Finally, we propose our hardware's improvements to perform a                         complete metabolite analysis such as glucose, lactate, ATP, LDH or O2 by adding specific                         sensors. Also we plan to build a fully functional incubator which would allow us to take cell                         cultures anywhere and connect several BOBs to form a linear 2D/3D cell culture automated essay.                         Up next, we will present our hardware which is divided in two main parts; a small glass flask                         named BOB and the automation system.
BOB
As mentioned previously, BOB is a small tempered glass flask designed to test molecule’s effect                         on cell cultures. Due to the properties of tempered glass, it can be depyrogenated which will                         allow us to reuse this flask more than once. This present diverse advantages in which they are                         included to be eco friendly, to be cheaper and to be easier to wash.
Figure 1. BoB: 3D model vs. reality
In the front side there is a small hole which will allow us to introduce the new cell culture                         medium whenever the old one is ready to be changed. Likewise, there is a elbow at the bottom                         which will help us to get rid of the old medium. Connected to this elbow we have a 3-way                         stopcock which will open using a servo-motor. We will talk more about it in the Automation                         System section.
To help BoB fulfill its function, we use small 5mm septas (white pieces in Figure 1) which                         allow us to introduce the new cell culture medium inside it via a syringe and also prevent the                         medium from flowing outside BoB.
Inside BoB we can find a PDMS membrane, in which the cells will rest, that is suspended ⅓ the                         flasks height over the bottom. The reason of the ⅓ is because we need the culture to have                         certain air space for correct cells’ oxygen diffusion. It was reported that optimal level of                         the medium is 0.2 cm, that is the equivalent to a volume of 0.2 mL/cm2 [1]. The membranes                         recipe is shown in Figure 2.
To keep the PDMS membrane suspended, we use orthodontic archwire to supports the membrane from                         below. This archwire is then attached to BoB’s lid with the help of two holes and 2 septas as                         seen in Figure 1.
The third hole on Bob’s lid is used to introduce the cells, using a syringe, inside the flask; a                         septa is also used in this hole so that the entire system is closed.
Figure 2. Procedure for PDMS membrane production.
To ensure the correct system’s behavior we created a combined base for Bob and the servo-motor                         that will open the 3-way stopcock. BoB’s part of the base has an inclination of 7.3 degrees to                         allow the medium to flow outside the flask, it also permits us to put a color sensor below the                         flask to measure the medium’s color. This part of the base also grabs the 3-way stopcock to                         prevent the servo from twisting it.

Automation System
For the correct use of the system, the input and output of the culture medium is required; these                         inputs and outputs are automatized to save time, reagents and preserve the sterile conditions                         of the environment thanks to the low interaction with humans. Using standardized times, volumes                         and parameters we implemented the automation of the system, resulting in a device that operates                         specifically for these objectives.
To make the automation system we used the following material:
Arduino Nano
Three Way Stopcock
Three Piece Syringe
Acrylic
MG995 Servo Motor
Stepper Motor
Arduino Nano
Endless Screw
Axis
Linear Bearings
Cople
7805 5V Regulator
NodeMCU WIFI Module
Rubber Septas
The Arduino Nano is the main device, providing the system with enough processing power to take                         the decisions. This board is the one in charge of processing the color sensor input,                         controlling the stepper motor and the servo motor, and dispatching the data from the sensor to the Nodemcu board. A friendly diagram of the electronics involved is shown below.
Figure 5. Electronics Design
Figure 6. Built Electronics
The Nodemcu take input from the arduino and sends the data to a Pyhton’s Flask server hosted in                         Heroku. This data can then be visualized in an web application built in React JS-Redux. This                         application is further explained in the software section.
The pumping system is composed by 3 main elements. The first one is the bipolar stepper motor                         which provides enough torque, precision and is used to inject the medium. The second part is                         the mechanism itself, shown in the below figure, which is made out of the acrylic base, the                         syringe and the endless screw. The last element is the servo motor, utilized to control the                         output of the medium.
Figure 7. Pumping Mechanism
Figure 8. Complete hardware (BoB, Pumping                                         System and Electronics)
The sensing of the system is made with the help of a TCS3200 color sensor. This sensor returns                         an RGB code which will then be transformed into a single value using the next function.
Value = Rb * 64 + Gb * 8 + Bb
Rb = R value in binary
Gb = G value in binary
Bb = B value in binary
The medium change sequence was programmed for it to be emitted when ever the sensor recognizes                         an orangish tone from the medium. When this happens, the arduino executes this sequence and the change occurs.
The sequence follows the next order:
Open the control valve.
Introduce cleaning medium (2ml).
Close the outlet valve.
Introduce 6.5ml of medium to fill the flask again.
In conclusion, all hardware built during this time works perfectly allowing us to fully automate                         the change and sensing of the medium while providing this data to a server. The advantages of                         this is enormous if applied correctly, in the below Improvement section we talk more about this                         topic and the future of this hardware.

Improvement
As part of the improvements, we will build a fully functional glass incubator. To replicate the                         same behavior of an already existing one, we will control temperature and CO2 flux and support                         an air filtration system. We will also integrate a microscope to watch the cell culture.
To control the temperature, we will design a close loop control system, using a NTC10KB3950K                         sensor to measure this variable as close to the culture as possible. In the same way, we will                         design a close loop control for the CO2 flux using a ASINPPOKAL25818 sensor to measure this                         variable.
The purpose of this incubator is to build a single interaction cell culture system that can be                         place anywhere in the lab. An image can be seen below showing a mock of the incubators size .
