                        and now. Therefore, in the path of developing TecTissue, we have several activities in order to
                        express the main objectives of our project, the need to solve the problem of burns and also
                        encourage people in the field of science.</P></DIV></DIV><H1>GOLD</H1><DIV class="row" id="rinoq"><DIV class="col"><H2>Rino-Q.</H2><P>On July, 5th, and 6th, we had the opportunity to visit Rino-Q, which stands for
                        “Integral Rescue
                        of the Burnt
                        Child” in Spanish. It is a foundation in charge of the overall rehabilitation of kids
                        and
                        adults who have
                        suffered burns. We had to book a hotel since we come from the State of Mexico and
                        traveled to
                        San Luis Potosi.
                        We arrived and got a brief tour of the facilities. After that, we had a meaningful
                        conversation
                        with the
                        director of the foundation, Gerardo Manuel García Lozano and his wife, Beatriz Eugenia
                        Hernández Contreras.
                        They explained to us the complications of treating with burned people as well as the
                        costs it
                        implied. One of
                        the most important aspects to consider when addressing the problem is the amount of
                        time
                        patients remain
                        hospitalized due to their burns. This represents one of the main opportunities for our
                        project.
                        The next day we taught a group of kids who were part of the foundation about synthetic
                        biology
                        and prepared
                        some activities to reinforce what they learned through games and interactive dynamics.
                        In the
                        end, we
                        approached the parents and families of the kids so that they could talk about their
                        experiences
                        and
                        testimonies. After the visit, we realized that, in addition to the statistics and
                        technical
                        information
                        regarding burned people and their treatment, we have a moral commitment with the kids
                        and
                        society in general
                        because we have the possibility and therefore the duty to help.</P><DIV class="row my-2 text-center"><DIV class="col-6"><FIGURE class="figure text-left"><VIDEO width="100%" controls=""><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption">Video 1: Demonstration of Rino-Q app</FIGCAPTION></VIDEO></FIGURE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" id="universum"><DIV class="col"><H2>UNIVERSUM</H2><P> Day one: Mexico has a deficit in science, the government only invests 1% of the GDP in this
                        sector, but the
                        public has a keen interest for new technologies and the improvement of synthetic biology and
                        this was an
                        excellent opportunity for us to inspire the desire to learn and move towards action.

                        On Saturday, July 21st we made a visit to the science museum “Universum” with the interest of
                        approaching kids
                        and the general public in order to teach them about the basics of synthetic biology with a
                        little workshop that
                        included fun activities and dynamics where everyone could participate. Most of the kids whose
                        interest was
                        peaked by our workshop. We welcomed with a brief explanation of molecular biology. The kids
                        really showed
                        enthusiasm and proceeded to do the activities we prepared for them. While the kids were playing
                        and learning
                        with the activities, we took a quick survey with the parents or relatives asking some questions
                        regarding their
                        take on burns, prevention, and treatment. The activities made in our workshop the first day
                        consisted of
                        teaching the kids about plasmids and bacterias with a brief introduction of how they work
                        without making it too
                        difficult for them. For the next day the activities that took place consisted in more didactic
                        exercises to
                        learn about biology and the structure of major skin cells.</P><DIV class="row my-3"><DIV class="col-6"><FIGURE class="figure text-left"><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption">Figure 1.

                        Furthermore, these undergraduates wanted to improve an accurate communication between all the

                        students. TecCEM team took presence at this event showcasing the main goals of iGEM, as well as
                        the primary
                        objectives of the competition. A brief outline of the project showed our aim and aspirations
                        for the project
                        also we offered a work plan design indicating our ambitions for it. Furthermore, the value of

                        achieved by
                        explaining the basis of our project &quot;Tec Tissue&quot; was to raise awareness about the problem we
                        are facing through
                        and with this they would be more interested in these lines of research. At the end of the
                        conference the
                        students were really interested IN participating in the next iGEM competitions and to learn

                        September 24th to 28th we had the opportunity to present our project not only with students of
                        the biological
                        sector but all the careers offered in the Campus. However, we were not the only team
                        participating for the
