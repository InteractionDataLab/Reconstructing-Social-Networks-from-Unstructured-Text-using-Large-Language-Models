                        analyze
                        their effects on a co culture of fibroblasts (L929) and mesenchymal cells after an in vitro
                        burn assay.
                        To evaluate the efficiency of the treatment, a measurement of the proliferation rate was
                        performed
                        using LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) as an analysis metabolite. Given that our treatment involves
                        the
                        usage of a growth factor, the rate at which this protein is released into the medium is
                        critical to
                        avoid adverse effects in the cellular line (such as cancer), for that reason a nano
                        encapsulation with
                        chitosan was also performed to control the rate at which our growth factor is released.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" id="summary"><DIV class="col"><H2>Summary</H2><H3>What did we accomplish?</H3><UL><LI>Nanoencapsulation in chitosan of leptin, BSA and RFP.</LI><LI>Realization of in vitro burn assay.</LI><LI>Realization of leptin proliferation essay.</LI><LI>Obtaining parts with adequate enzyme recognition sites.</LI><LI>Protein production of leptin and tenascin C (More validations are needed).</LI><LI>Co-culture of fibroblast and mesenchymal cells.</LI><LI>Cellular growth in TaCO-BOB hardware.</LI></UL><H3>What happened?</H3><UL><LI>We started ligating parts, no bands of expected size were observed but we attributed this

                            induction. Nevertheless, we realized that consistent results were not achieved (bad protein
                            migration rates, sometimes no induction band could be observed). [Unfortunately, we
                            invested a lot of time on this period]</LI><LI>Then we started thinking that our parts did not had the necessary extra nucleotides for
                            proper cleavage of restriction enzymes and what we were truly observing was the effect of
                            star activity and inappropriate ligation, resulting in non specific plasmids which did not
                            contained our whole part but conferred the bacteria antibiotic resistance. </LI></UL><H3>How did we solved it?</H3><P>We designed primers that incorporate the necessary nucleotides into our parts. Thus, we started
                        having proper migrations of project parts and posterious transformations and protein production

                            called BBCOL], into an RFC10 compatible psB1C3 iGEM plasmid
                            for future transformations into <I>E. coli</I>. We had several transformation attempts
                            (Figure 1),
                            most of the times there are no adequate migrations patterns achieved. We
                            carried on with
                            bacterial transformation and protein production, as we thought that bands of
                            ligation could
                            not be seen given the agarose sensibility, surprisingly bacterial colonies
                            (either <I>E. coli</I>
                            BL21(DE3) and DH5 alpha ) were seen (Figure 2) in selective medium but no
                            constant protein
                            production could be achieved (Go to phase 2for more information). After
                            many failed
                            attempts and a lot of time invested, we suspected that maybe ligations were
                            failing due to
                            the absence of “close to the end DNA cleavage nucleotides” (needed for
                            restriction
                            cutting). To solve the problem previously mentioned, primers were designed to
                            tackle this
                            problems using iGEM prefix and suffix sequences as template for amplification.
                            We amplified
                            BBLEP (Figure 3) and ligated it into psB1C3 finally obtaining the expected
                            sizes at each
                            step. Thus with this methodology we could resolve the difficulties for BBLEP
                            and achieving
                            a transformation in BL21(DE3) (Figure 4), due to timewise limitations and the
                            embedded DNA
                            synthesize problems, BBCOL and BBTNC could not be tested with this methodology.
                            Future
                            plans include applying that methodology to those parts and transforming into
                            respective

                            purification of our protein of interests. This phase was a key factor for the demonstration
                            of the functionality of our project. First, we obtained polyacrylamide gels that had clear
                            signs of maximum induction of our proteins at 5 hours after IPTG induction. The results
                            that we obtained were inconsistent between several repetitions of the induction.
                        </P><P>
                            After that observation several hypotheses were formulated in order to explain those events,
                            the first one was that the synthesis sequence had several errors, which made the peptide
                            product unstable, and an easy target for degradation. This hypothesis was mainly supported
                            by the apparition of the protein at 5h after induction, but its complete disappearance
                            after 16 hours, specifically TCD that needs a protein fusion to improve its stability and
                            reduce the rate of degradation.
                        </P><P>The second hypothesis was that the used strain (<I>E. coli</I> BL21 (DE3)) was mislabeled,
                            therefore the transformation and induction were on strains unable to produce RNApol T7.
                            This idea was discarded after several experiments were made on fresh strains, obtaining the
                            same inconsistent results. Even though the results continued to be inconsistent, with the
                            fresh strains some improvement was made. Tenascin was observed for the first time on
                            SDS-PAGE after 5h of induction (see figure 5). Also a Dot Blot was performed in order to
                            evaluate the presence of Tenascin and Leptin using the His-TAG (see figure 7).
                        </P><P>The third and last hypothesis was that an error on the synthesis meant that there were not
                            enough nucleotides for allowing the restriction enzymes (EcoRI and PstI) to work properly,
                            reducing ligation efficiency. In order to test this hypothesis new primers were developed,
                            those primers after amplification with PCR, added extra nucleotides to the prefix and
                            suffix o the parts promoting the properly work of the enzymes. </P><P>Finally, since <I>E.coli</I> BL21 (DE3) has a protein that migrates at the same levels [1]
                            as those
                            expected for leptin, a Western Blot was performed in order to get more specific results.
                            Using an anti-His antibodies we were able to determined the presence and the production of
                            the leptin. In order to do this, a inoculum of transformed<I>E.coli</I> BL21 was induced at
                            a
                            concentration of 1mM IPTG. The samples were lizated utilizing RIPA buffer and were loaded
                            on an gradient 5%-20% BioRad SDS-PAGE. This was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane
                            and incubated with anti-His antibodies. The results were positive, obtaining bands (where
                            the antibody binds) at a size close to 17 kDa, similar to the expected leptin molecular
                            weight (see figure 8). So the production of leptin is proposed, but further experimentation
                            is required to standardize its production.

                                be explained as the lost of function of IPTG given by continuous exposure to high

                                molecular weight for BBTCD as a fusion protein, made us suggested that the protein

                                positions 3, 5 an 7 gives a positive result in presence of recombinant proteins which
                                contain a histidine tag, in positions 4, 6 and 8 an even more colored point is
                                detected, this confirm that the production of protein increases significantly after 5
                                hours of induction. On the other hand positions 1 and 2, which accounts for negative
                                control, resolves that <I>E. coli</I> BL21 (DE3) does not produces endogenous native

                                with a high content of histidine tags that could be misunderstood as our protein, this
                                event partially eliminates false positive results. Meanwhile position 9, which account
                                for positive control, shows no coloured point, this effect must be due to the high
                                degree of dilution that we applied to the positive control (1:1000), also there is no
                                visualization of the mark that normally happens when the sample dries, thus we can
                                conclude that our positive control, which was a recombinant protein from E coli, was
                                not in optimal state. This result complicates the final decision about our protein

                                migrate in a similar way, therefore both bands render undistinguishable. To overcome
                                this problem, a Western Blot was performed using an anti-His antibody, taking advantage
                                that leptin contains a 6xHis Tag and the native protein does not, so the antibody will
                                only bind to leptin. The results after the incubation with the antibodies determined
                                not only the presence of a peptide of around 17 kDa with an histidine Tag, presumably
                                leptin. But also as the width of the band increased as the induction time increased
                                (for times 0, 2h, 4h and 6h), thus suggesting a successful IPTG induction of the part.

                            important to develop new mechanisms to test the viability of improvements or new
                            treatments. For that reason,we decided to perform an assay which consisted of analysing
                            cell proliferation after submitting L-929 cell line to a burning procedure. This allowed us
                            to monitor if the evaluation of our treatment through this mechanism was feasible.
                        </P><P>
                            After setting different exposure times (15, 30, 45 and 60 seconds) to which each well would
                            be exposed to HBSS (Hank solution) at 60ºC, we registered the results comparing the damage
                            taken by the cell culture in each of the wells. We can conclude that the longer the cells
                            are exposed to the solution, the more damage they take and the less cellular density is
                            observed. This analysis allowed us to proceed with the evaluation of TecTissue performing
                            another burn assay to apply later the treatment we designed. The importance of the
                            standardization lies in the fact that it establishes the way in which we will perform the
                            following assays to determine the efficiency of our project and set the basis for a more
                            specific complex burn model.

                            significant changes in cell viability and morphology in relation to the time they were
                            exposed to the hot HBSS.

                            causing possible cell necrosis and cell detachment of cell culture flasks. The different
                            times employed are directly proportional to the harm taken by the culture and therefore the
                            number of cells is visibly reduced. This assay allows researchers to perform in vitro
                            analysis of burn process and the nature of the procedure makes it a feasible and
                            reproductive alternative to study the cellular and molecular alterations throughout the
                            burn process. In perspective, we could measure necrosis, cell viability, LDH, among others.

                            that reason, we performed another burn assay with the times stated before but applying the
                            hot HBSS to a co-culture of L-929 fibroblasts and human mesenchymal stem cells. Since our
                            project is based on the combination of several factors, we decided to test the activity of
                            each throughout the regeneration of the cultures.The compatibility of both cell lines
                            allowed us to perform the procedure without any complication. However, due to the
                            importance of the procedure, an MTT assay was performed additionally to ensure the accuracy
                            of the results obtained and to legitimate the conclusions reached after the assay. The
                            following pictures show the amount of cells depending on three factors:

                            molecular level the viability of the cells remaining, we performed an MTT assay with the
                            purpose of relating the proliferation of the cells with the efficiency of the treatment.

                            This figure compares the proliferation of the co-culture when one of the samples is treated

                            and the other with empty nanoparticles. The graph shows that the dosified release of leptin
                            increases the proliferation and regeneration of the cells while the ones that received the
                            treatment without the leptin did not have the same response. This behaviour is due to the
                            activity of the leptin, which is slowly released into the matrix allowing cells to absorb
                            it and enhance their metabolic activity to proliferate. Nevertheless, we can observe that
                            empty chitosan nanoparticles may cause some response.

                            observed that cells treated with TecTissue were indeed metabolic enhanced and confluent
                            compared to the ones that were not treated. Some aspects to consider are that even though
                            the leptin, heparan, and collagen were studied, none of them were evaluated separately,
                            which means that further analysis should be performed to determine the activity of each
                            element within the treatment. As stated in the corresponding sections, chitosan, heparan
                            and collagen each play a specific role in our project and the combination of them represent
                            at first glance, a good opportunity to develop new treatments for burn injuries. Even
                            though we demonstrated the efficiency of TecTissue, it is important to mention that within
                            72 hours, the confluence of both conditions (charged and empty NP), present no significant
                            differences. This means that the effects of our treatment are more visible within the first
                            48 hours. Since confluence of both wells were similar, we can say that TecTissue is a
                            feasible treatment but within the short term. Further analysis should be made to determine
                            whether it is possible to increase the efficiency of the treatment considering the areas of
                            opportunity identified after the assay. </P><P>Another thing that needs to be sorted out, is the relation between the co-culture and the
                            damage induced, with the presence or absence of leptin within the nanoparticles because the
                            results obtained with the microscope suggest that the chitosan alone could plays a key role
                            in the regeneration and proliferation of the fibroblasts. </P><FIGURE class="figure text-center w-100"><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption">Figure 14. Similar confluence in both conditions 72

                            metabolites such as Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), proliferation cytokines like tissue growth
                            factor beta, which is known to be released by the mesenchymal stem cells due to the action
                            of leptin.
                        </P><P>The amount of cells that can be seen in each well of the plate are directly related to the
                            time it was exposed to the hot HBSS, the treatment employed and the time it was left
                            incubated afterwards. For that reason, it is important to describe the role of each element
                            of the treatment and its influence in the regeneration of the cells: Collagen and heparan
                            as the scaffold, leptin as the growth factor and chitosan as the vehicle that regulated the
                            release of the drug. The combination of all these, allowed cells to react positively and
                            enhance the proliferation, increasing its rate and potentiating the healing process.</P></DIV><DIV class="my-3" id="cellcultureBOB"><H1>Cell culture in BOB</H1><P>Part of the evaluation of TecTissue consisted in testing the feasibility of our hardware,
                            which was designed with the purpose of automatizing 2D/3D cell cultures. In order to
                            evaluate if BOB is useful, we decided to perform a co-culture within it and analyse if
                            cells were able to adhere to the PDMS surface and proliferate. The following pictures
                            display how cells behaved when cultivated in BOB. To achieve our goal, we had to adequate
                            the hardware with the molecules necessary for the correct adherence of the cells. In other
                            words, we tested several combinations of the elements that comprise TecTissue. For example,
                            a BOB with a scaffold made out of PDMS supplemented with collagen and heparan. The same
                            study was performed with other combinations of said elements and removing the PDMS. After
                            incubating for at least one day, we photo documented and recorded the results observed in a
                            microscope employing fluorescence to ensure cells were correctly adhered to the synthetic
                            matrix.</P><P>The results demonstrate that porous-collagen-based scaffolds membrane are effective for cell
                            culture and tissue engineering. The images obtained from the epifluorescence microscope
                            with a mitochondrial dye allow us to conclude that employing these elements it is possible
                            to perform a co-culture. This is supported by the immunofluorescence assay that allowed us
                            to see the correct attachment of the cells. Further analysis should be performed to enhance
                            the efficiency of the PDMS and increase the cellular adhesion.
