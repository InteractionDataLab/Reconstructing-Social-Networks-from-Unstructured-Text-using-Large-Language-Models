                tripolyphosphate (TPP)</H1><P> The main objective of nanoencapsulation was to create an efficient vehicle for protein delivery. In
                order to attain this, we applied the nanoencapsulation protocol from iGEM TAS Taipei 2016 and produced
                a smaller nanoparticle with an approximate size of ~27 nm. The creation of smaller particles yields a
                higher internalization rate of several drugs, which acts inside the cell, rather than on the surface
                receptors, small nanoparticles ( &lt; 39 nm) are able to pass through the nuclear pore complexes via
                passive
                diffusion and have a higher endocytosis rate. Nuclear target nanoparticles are an example of such a
                design. (Tamman, 2015) </P><P>We assessed the fact that during encapsulation pH may need a
                modification to optimize the interaction between chitosan and proteins, shifting the encapsulation
                efficiency. A troubleshoot was applied for this protocol to work better with any protein, as pH 5.5
                is not a universal ideal condition. The reason behind this is that chitosan is positively charged
                when dissolved in an acidic environment, and proteins with low isoelectric value are better
                encapsulated at a pH greater than the pI value, favoring the interaction between negatively charged
                proteins and chitosan. Therefore, before encapsulating any protein, the pI has to be consulted to
                adjust the chitosan solution pH, so that pI &lt; pH &lt; 6.5 as an ideal condition, though not all
                proteins
                will meet such constraint (Gan and Wang, 2007). Our improvement proposal is demonstrated by the
                encapsulation of a standard protein that meets this suggested condition.</P><P>The employed red
                fluorescent protein (BBa_J04450) has an isoelectric point of around 5.6.
                The characterization of RFP encapsulation was made under the following conditions as stated by
                TAS Taipei 2016: pH of 4 to avoid chitosan aggregation and solution concentrations of 3 mg/mL
                chitosan and 1 mg/mL TPP. This resulted in an encapsulation with an average size of ~27 nm.
                Like proposed by team TAS Taipei 2016, RFP encapsulation was verified by centrifugation of
                particle suspension and UV irradiation of the formed pellet.</P><DIV class="text-center"><FIGURE class="figure text-center"><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption"><STRONG>Figure 1. Fluorescence detected after centrifugation of

                        electron microscopy (TEM), but we hypothesize this discrepancy is caused by particle
                        conglomeration rather than different particle sizes. Water at pH 7.4 was the solvent in which
                        particles were resuspended for the NS300 analysis, while samples were treated beforehand for
                        the observation in TEM. This treatment helps to enable a clear observation of individual
                        nanoparticles. This effect may not be reached in an environment like an aqueous solution.</P><DIV class="text-center"><FIGURE class="figure text-left"><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption"><STRONG>Figure 4. Particle conglomeration in NanoSight

                        carried out using bovine serum albumin (BSA). BSA has a pI ranging from 4.7 to 4.9 as chitosan
                        is soluble in acidic environments while acquiring a positive net charge. By adjusting the pH to
                        5.5 BSA charges become negative, improving the interaction with chitosan. Encapsulation
                        efficiency may be optimized with this adjustments. </P><P>The standard curve was derived with the Bradford assay to determine the concentrations of free
                        protein in the supernatant after encapsulation and centrifugation.</P><DIV class="text-center"><FIGURE class="figure text-left"><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption"><STRONG>Figure 5. Standard curve for BSA supernatant
                                    concentration of nanoparticles.</STRONG></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><P>Encapsulation efficiency was then determined from:</P><P>The resulting efficiency for BSA loaded nanoparticles was 42% from a four encapsulation sample
                        assay. BSA has a molecular weight (MW) of 66.5 kDa and a pI of 4.6. As it has been proved,
                        encapsulation efficiency increases with decreasing MW. Though BSA has a high MW, the pI &lt; pH
                        effect generates a high-efficiency percentage according to literature. (Jarudilokkul, 2011)
                    </P><H1>Chromoproteins</H1><P>In many systems for the control of cloning and transformation reporter protein are used, but
                        what happens when two different reporter proteins are cloned in the same vector and expressed
                        at the same time? That is what here wanted to answer by fusioning two reporter cassettes. In
                        this case a constitutive blue chromoprotein and a repressible Red Fluorescent Protein were
                        cloned in a pSB1C3 plasmid to observe how both reporters interact and if our hypothesis of
                        obtaining a purple color would be true.
                        To prove this idea, after the ligation of the both parts with the plasmid, previously
                        mentioned, this complex needs to be transformed into an appropriate <I>Escherichia coli</I> strain and
                        then, the coloration of the colonies has to be measured.
                    </P><P>
                        Another experiment was the repression of Red Fluorescent Protein to prove the expression of
                        Blue Chromoprotein one. This kind of system allows the design of complex multiple reporter
                        proteins to simplify the selection process and developed stronger controls during the creation
                        of synthetic biology projects.
