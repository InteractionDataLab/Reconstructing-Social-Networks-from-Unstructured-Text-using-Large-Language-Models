Summary
We had the iGEM Latin America 2018 Meet Up! We had the pleasure to receive teams                                         from all over Mexico and Latin America such as Brazil, Ecuador, and Chile where                                         they presented their projects and got feedback from specialists. This Meetup                                         was important for the teams to get an overall look into their work and                                         something to note is that the event got a lot of diffusion online.                                          We also started the planification and logistics for Universium as next week the event would take place.
Wet lab
The first try to do an assembly of LL37 was performed using the previous LL37                                         fragment and a PCR cycle with all the reactants of the Agilent kit.                                         Successfully after the second try the plasmid was assembled with the LL37                                         sequence, this was done by increasing the number of cycles to 16. This assemble                                         gave us a plasmid that contain a T7 promoter, bacterial Ori, Amp resistance,                                         terminator and the LL37 protein along with a His tag.
Human practice
The iGEM Latin America Meet Up had place in our campus, we had the presence of                                         teams from Monterrey, Guadalajara, Chihuahua and virtual presence of teams from                                         Brazil, Chile and Ecuador. In this meet up the teams had the opportunity to                                         give a presentation such as pre-run to practice the one that has to be done in                                         Boston, in addition several specialists were there to analyse and give feedback                                         in the projects. The logistics of the visit to Universium was performed.
Week 27th
15 July- 21 July.
Summary
We had meetings with several teams seeking if we could collaborate with them and                                         see how the rest of the iGEM teams are doing to try and expand communication                                         around the scientific community. We also went on with the preparations for                                         Universum. We continued with the characterization of LL37 and the                                         transformation of E. coli. The DNA synthesize from IDT was delivered and the                                         first project insights could be achieved. This week Interlab was done in the                                         lab to obtain the results.
Wet lab
The plasmid with LL37 was transformed in E. coli strains as Rosetta gami and                                         BL21 (DE3), the transformations were successful as single colonies were                                         achieved. In order to verify the transformation plasmid extraction was                                         performed and positive results were obtained. The IDT sequences for collagen                                         type V (COL5), tenascin domain V (TCD5) and leptin (LEP) were resuspended in                                         bio mol water for the creation of stocks. A ligation to the plasmid psB1C3 was                                         performed by enzymatic restriction and T4 DNA ligation.
Human practice
The visit to Universum was done in the weekend, during this time we explained                                         biotechnology concepts to children and gave them a little insight to the                                         subject. We also talked with their parents to explain more about the science                                         field in genetic engineering and the project in general terms, by doing this we                                         expected that biotechnology and the general public can come into contact and                                         become a subject of interest for everyone.                                         In addition, we took this opportunity as a way to gather some data by doing a                                         survey, which will help us in the development of an app for burn prevention.
Week 28th
22 July- 28 July.
Summary
This week we finished Interlab and sent the forms to iGEM, we continued as well                                         to communicate with other iGEM teams from around the world to collaborate and                                         we started to organize with them to do the video. We advanced with the                                         transformation of the iGEM parts in E. coli strains and with the design of our                                         hardware, but also we started seeking for the establishment of an experiment                                         which could asses our project viability.
Dry lab
In order to evaluate our project we started the searching of a protocol which we                                         could use in our human cell lines to recreate the effects caused by burn                                         accidents with either hot liquids or hot surfaces, which was told by the                                         foundation Rhino Q to be the most common ones. We obtained two main articles                                         which had a lot of potential to our project, both articles described the                                         methodology in which we could treat our cell lines to recreate this burning                                         effect and also it was described how we could measure it. By those means our                                         assays would involved the usage of a hot glass Petri dish and the evaluation of                                         cell viability by the usage of MTT or other molecules.

We transformed E. coli DH5 alpha for plasmid multiplication purposes resulting                                         into correct results for BBLEP and BBTNC5, for BBCOL5 the observance of red                                         colonies were determined as a non conclusive result because of the problem that                                         BBCOL5 part construction had a constitutive RFP as a reporter but the                                         re-ligation of any iGEM plasmid also results in a RFP but controlled by a lac                                         promoter, in order to verify the results obtained a posterious induction / non                                         induction experiment must be done to determine the veracity of the ligation. We                                         made a quick trial into the recreation of burn assay into our cellular lines,                                         we obtained interesting results showing that the exposure of 15, 30 and 60                                         seconds to PBS at approximately 80oC showed a decrease in cell morphology and                                         cell viability, the results were obtained by cell counting in Neubauer chamber                                         with trypan blue and microscope visualization.
Hardware
We came to a possible proposal of a skin chip and designed a 3D model including                                         the mechanisms, the proper calculations and how to automate the system. This                                         model still very naive and is needed to get proper correction in order to create the first design of the skin chip.
Interlab
The parts of iGEM kit plate distribution was transformed in E. coli DH5 alpha                                         strain and alkaline plasmid extraction was performed and agarose gel analysis                                         was done to verify plasmid existence. Calibration and cell measurement                                         protocols were performed and submitted in the wiki                                         (https://2018.igem.org/Team:TecCEM/InterLab).
Week 29th
29 July- 4 August.
Summary
This week was the last week of summer break so we had to work harder than ever.                                         A briefing about what was done during the summer was broken down in a meeting                                         and a new planification of objectives was done.
Wet lab
We performed the transformation of all project parts (BBCOL5, BBLEP and BBTNC5)                                         into protein production strains such as BL21(DE3) and Rosetta (DE3). After                                         alkaline plasmid extraction and analysis in electrophoresis we could conclude                                         that the existence of the parts project BBLEP and BBTNC5 were achieved, even                                         though several more analysis must be performed in order to obtain significant                                         results. In the case of BBCOL5 an experiment of induction/non induction was                                         performed to analyse if the ligation product was a re-ligation of iGEM plasmid,                                         the results obtained concluded that the part was indeed a re- ligation product                                         and for so on BBCOL5 ligation was discarded as part of the project but used as                                         a medium to obtaining RFP for nanoencapsulation experiments.
Hardware
We contacted COMSOL for their software specialized in microfluidics also a                                         professor in our campus that specializes in microfluidic modelling was                                         contacted for tutoring.
Week 30th
5 August- 11 August.
Summary
This weekend we started classes in our university, also we had significant                                         advances in the verification of plasmid existence (project parts) in bacteria                                         colonies. We started production and purification of protein of interest. We had                                         an incident in the lab too, our centrifuge broke and the cellular lines died!
Dry lab
We tried to make a custom medium broth for collagen production and consulted                                         with a professor to reassure the calculous sheet was correct but the idea was                                         shut down because it could have had too many variables.
Wet lab
We started with protein production of protein LL37 of E. coli strains: Rosetta,                                         DH5a and BL21. The electrophoresis analysis in polyacrylamide gel of LL37                                         protein production was performed but no results were achieved, this could have                                         been due to lysis protocol, thus new purification protocols were revised. The                                         cellular lines of HaCaT and L929 had died because of a runout accident of CO2                                         master tank, producing acidification and loss of morphology, plans for                                         obtaining new aliquots of cellular lines started. The device BBCOL5 was tried                                         to ligate into plasmid pSB1A3, but no consistent results were achieved.
Week 31st
12 August- 18 August.
Summary
This week we had several team meetings to get some team building going and                                         continued the protein production for characterization. Also the first advances                                         of a complete hardware were finally achieved.
Wet lab
New protocols for purification of LL37 protein were done. RIPA buffer lysis                                         protocol was used but polyacrylamide gel analysis was not achieved because of                                         difficulties in visualization. We improved our polyacrylamide protocol and got                                         a new Coomassie solution given as a gift from one professor which really helped                                         us to visualize our gels more easily. For protein production analysis of the                                         project parts (BBLEP and BBTNC5), an induction curve was performed, in which                                         samples of each device transformed into BL21(DE3) were analyzed in a time lapse                                         of 9 hours after IPTG induction, taking aliquots of 1 mL per hour for                                         posterious protein analysis experiments, each aliquot was done by duplicated                                         and observed in spectrophotometer at OD600 to correlate protein production with                                         total biomass. Also we obtained new HaCaT cell lines.
Math model
We had a meeting with several professors to help us get a better idea about the                                         whole math model and the reach our project could have.
Hardware
Models for skin chip were design using AutoCad and Catia softwares, the                                         modelations of flows were done and the materials needed were investigated.
Week 32nd
19 August- 25 August.
Summary
This week we had several advances into the software and hardware part of the                                         project. The protein curve production was analysed by polyacrylamide gel. The                                         first insights into RFP purification were obtained.
Wet lab
The protein curve was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel and the results obtained                                         were not good enough, several factors affected the quality of the gel. We                                         started with nano encapsulation of RFP and visualization of nanoparticles in                                         SEM microscoped.
Week 33rd
26 August- 1 September.
Summary
Our protein production began, we consulted a professor specialized on proteins                                         that gave us several tips on it. We reworked the hardware design as a final one                                         that is less expensive and more innovative, then we sent the design into a                                         company so the corp was made.
Wet lab
We created a new production protein curve and performed an analysis by                                         electrophoresis and Bradford quantification. The polyacrylamide gel was done at                                         20% to obtain a better separation of protein, although no significant                                         overproduction bands were seen. The quantification by Bradford methodology                                         showed a low quantity of protein in pellet centrifugation. This results made us                                         re-evaluate the lysis protocol and change the quantification methodology. We                                         made contact with a professor expert in recombinant protein production and we                                         obtained new crucial points for a new definitive curve. We made nano                                         encapsulation with RFP and saw it in SEM microscope, no structure was seen, we                                         started seeking for new methodologies for obtaining better resolution in the                                         results. We performed a new assay of in vitro skin burn in L-929 cell line.
Hardware
The manufacturing of the skin chip was investigated, the final material used for                                         this purpose was glass as it can be reused and can help labs to cut their                                         dependence in trash-able cell culture bottles. Several companies were contacted                                         in order to quote prices, and at the end the company “” was contacted to create                                         the skin chip carcass.
Week 34th
2 September - 8 September.
Summary
On this week we retried the curve of protein production of BBLEP and BBTNC but                                         applying the points that our professor gave us, the results obtained made us                                         replan the project methodology into a fresh beginning.
Wet lab
After the results obtained last week we set the objective to prove that our                                         proteins could be produced by the bacteria. For this to be achieved we made a                                         new production protein curve with different new settings such as: BL21(DE3)                                         with another plasmid to corroborate that bands seen were not result of                                         antibiotic resistance peptides, creation of a non induced protein curve, and                                         starting induction until OD600 of 0.7. The results obtained were not                                         significant and there were no bands showing our proteins. Also we performed a                                         PCR to an alkaline extraction of plasmids coming from BL21(DE3) transformed                                         strains (BBLEP and BBTNC), using VR and VF2 primers, the results obtained show                                         no amplification of BBLEP and inconsistent results for BBTNC. With that on mind                                         we aimed to redo the transformation of parts and protein production, in order to obtain new and much better results. We also obtained kanamycin for the                                         ligation of BBCOL into psB1K3. We realized the quantification of lactate of our                                         burned cell lines at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 minutes, in order to get numerical data                                         that will translate into proliferation rate after a burn accident, those                                         results will help us into developing a more accurate math model for the                                         purposes of the project.
Dry Lab
We started to investigate new lysis protocol to ensure that our protein was                                         released from the bacterial pellet, we obtained one protocol which was specific                                         for the purification of tag His proteins derived from BL21(DE3), but also we                                         attended with our professor specialist in protein purification for new                                         protocols, she gave us a Laemmli buffer for fast visualization of results for                                         protein induction. Also we received the idea from one of our assessors to use                                         RIPA buffer for the lysis, but after an extensive internet research no                                         methodology was seemed to work with E. coli pellets.
Hardware
We went to CDMX to obtain the hoses and syringes for the assembly of the skin                                         chip. Also we talked with professor Chong to land the idea of how we will be                                         measuring the proliferation rate in the skin chip, the idea ended up in the                                         usage of Tsc3200, which is a programmable converter of light (colour) to raw                                         data, that will measure the virage (acidification) of DMEM medium from rose                                         into orange, which is due to the metabolism of cells and would be a good                                         parameter for account how much the cell is growing given the application of the                                         project and when those the system must change the medium.
Week 35th
9 September - 15 September.
Summary
This week we re-organized the project objectives according to a our new                                         chronogram and replanificated our biggest goals to achieve the production and                                         purification of our proteins, also nanoparticles creation was performed. We started our production from ground zero as we were not having any positive                                         results, and as a way to troubleshoot this we made new competent cells to                                         produce our proteins. Nonetheless, the hardware prototype was finally obtained                                         and some tests were performed to get insight into it’s functionality.
Wet lab
The production and purification of RFP was successful by implementing the new                                         lysis buffer, even though, a modification in the buffer must be performed to                                         increase the lysis efficiency given that there was still red color in the                                         pellet. Using the resultant RFP we started the nano encapsulation, the result                                         was store at 4oC. We started the creation of completely new BL21 (DE3)                                         competent cells for the posterious transformations of newly ligated parts. We                                         obtained kanamycin for the implementation of psB1K3 in the ligation of BBCOL5                                         part. We performed the transformation of the new BL21 (DE3) chemocompetent                                         cells and we obtained white colonies, by that mean, we performed induction of                                         protein expression in the new colonies to completely verify the presence of our                                         proteins, for a posterious polyacrylamide gel analysis. Sadly, after the                                         incomplete subculture of L929 given by the loss of functionality of our                                         trypsin, no good cells could be incorporated into the new flask and because of                                         that we lost our cell line, for so on we must obtain another aliquot.
Dry Lab
We researched a new lysis protocol for purification of proteins. The protocol we                                         obtained was specific for cell lysis and nickel affinity purification of E.                                         coli BL21. From that protocol we keep special attention in the lysis buffer                                         which is comprised of many reductant agents. Also in an article which described                                         the lysis method for E. coli we found that his lysis buffer was exactly the                                         same as the one we previously encounter, for that we decided to give that                                         buffer a try but with modifications according to our experience such as                                         incubation with lysozyme.

We obtained the prototype of the “skin reactor” and performed a test to                                         determine exhaust capacity of the prototype using only inclination and                                         centrifugal force. The results obtained showed that an angle of 7.5° was                                         necessary to remove most of the medium from the medium chamber. For that the                                         creation of a base would be necessary for the removal of medium given those                                         characteristics. We then proceed to modelate the base in CATIA and later we 3D                                         printed it in our school.
Week 36th
16 September - 22 September.
Summary
Great news ! On this week we started gazing the first possible obtention of our                                         proteins. Also we created more important components for the transformation of                                         BBCOL5. The hardware was improved by incorporating all the components necessary                                         for his functionality.
Wet lab
For the nanoparticles we then went to IPN institute to use their TEM                                         (transmission electron microscope) and NanoSight to show the results obtained,                                         we could proudly say that the first extraction of RFP nanoparticles was                                         achieved and a good image from TEM was obtained.
Hardware
The final assemblies were done and the automatization parts were laser cut for                                         their incorporation.
Week 37th
23 September - 29 September.
Summary
This week we began working way harder in the lab as deadlines approach. We                                         decided as a team the wiki order and design, as well as a name for our                                         hardware.
Wet lab
Nanoparticles standardisation was done with Bradford assay for a quick                                         encapsulation once Leptin begins production. PBS pH 7.4 was used to recreate                                         physiological medium and test nanoparticles liberation.
Hardware
The last assemblies were done and the sensors were tested and connected.
Week 38th
30 September - 6 October.
Summary
As deadlines approach, we looked into the option of synthesizing new primers to                                         fix a DNA sequence problem in our Biobricks. The Wiki Freeze being so close we started uploading all our results to our wiki. We had a lot of stress going on and ran the final tests on our project. We were both exhausted and excited to reach the conclusion of this great experience as a team.
Wet lab
Nanoparticles were observed in Nanosight with the encapsulation of BSA to                                         confirm the size. Some liberation assays were done to quantify protein concentration with PBS at pH 7.4 to simulate physiological medium.                                         For the parts, a PCR was done.                                         Some gels were run.                                         A sequencing company was contacted to troubleshoot our sequence.
Software
The software design was defined and most of the databases completed.
