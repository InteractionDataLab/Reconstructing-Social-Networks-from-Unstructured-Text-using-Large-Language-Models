                        functionalities, a cell counter, a BioBrick builder and an activity log for our hardware. Up
                        next, we will explain each one of them!</P><P>You can download our suite of software from the following link <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2018/e/eb/T--TecCEM--Software.zip" download="">Download</A></P><P>You can access to our software live in the following link <A class="text-project" target="_blank" href="http://igem-texem.firebaseapp.com">Access</A></P><P>Alternatively you could follow our latest improvements in the github page <A class="text-project" href="https://github.com/iGEM-TEC-CEM/Software-iGEM">Github</A></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" id="bbBuilder"><DIV class="col"><H1>BioBrick Builder</H1><P>Biobrick building is an extremely important, but also very prone to errors process. One of the
                        most tedious tasks of creating a biobrick is searching each on of the basic parts through the
                        library, comparing its characteristics and trying to find the appropriate one for the wanted
                        outcome. We noticed that most of the times we filter by the top-level needs such as the
                        organism and main standards, then select a set of characteristics that we consider in the
                        filtering of the part and finally we choose the most used and most reliable parts in the iGEM
                        library. Nevertheless, even after the desired biobrick is found, we proceed to a mostly
                        handmade process that consists of copy-pasting the sequence, adding the prefix and suffix and
                        expecting by all cost to avoid human mistake. On top of this, to design a standardized
                        biobrick, we need to check for several characteristics based on our selected RFC, this is a
                        simple task with a small sequence, but the sequence could get more and more complicated and we
                        could forget to design a sequence that complies for the RFC.
                    </P><H2>Solution</H2><P>We designed a software to facilitate the creation of biobricks, the main functionality is to
                        provide a tool to search for the desired parts such as promoters, rbs and terminators. Once
                        done that, we collect the selected information and produce a final biobrick with prefixes and
                        suffixes integrated, this allows you to copy and paste to a more complex tool such as Snapgene
                        and optimize the sequence or confirm the biobrick in order to send to iGEM for confirmation.
                        Our software include a scrapper that collects the basic parts of the igem library and adds
                        relevant information for you to observe and analyze. Afterwards, it includes sections for each
                        of the basic parts of a composite biobrick, these being the promoters, rbs and terminators. In
                        these sections you can search by name, filter by type, standard, chassis, and you can read
                        other information depending on the basic part; you can get the sequence as well. At the end a
                        set of basic parts, the constructed biobricks with the scars, the prefixes, and the suffixes
                        will be obtained.</P><P>Our goal with this piece software is to introduce the automation of things into the biotech
                        world by merely simplifying one small area of the biobrick construction. We are aware biobrick
                        building requires more than a block builder type software, but with the continuous improvement,
                        we believe we could create an open source application to facilitate this and many more tasks.</P><H2>Design</H2><P>Our software consists of a simple interface that firstly asks for the organism you will work
                        with and the standard you want to comply to. We currently only support RFC 10 integration, but
                        adding more standards is a trivial task we could expect to do the following days after the
                        Jamboree.
                        After the main selection screen we enter the promoter selection screen. The parts were obtained
                        with the help of a scrapper which crolls all over the iGEM library, we selected a few
                        characteristics to quickly filter the promoters such as the short description, the regulation,
                        the sample status and the organism we want to develop the biobrick in. This quickly reduces the
                        library by a fraction, we could then proceed to click on the desired promoter and we could
                        inspect even more characteristics of the part, one benefit of the software is that if we want
                        to we could insert our own sequence for the final biobrick.
                        The following screens consist of the same interaction with different features depending on the
                        part we are selecting such as the rbs and the terminator.</P><H2>Video</H2><VIDEO width="100%" height="auto" controls=""><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption"><STRONG>Video.

This part of
                        the web application is where the software and the hardware converge into a single solution. The
                        user interface is really basic and minimalistic and shows the data obtained from the hardware
                        as a table and as a graph.</P><P>To distinguish between all the different projects from different people we use a login.
                        First-time users need to register into the platform which will create an account for them. Once
                        this is done, the person can register different projects. </P><FIGURE class="figure text-center"><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption text-xs-right">Figure 1.

                        (hardware) with the platform. First of all, it is necessary to have BoB, its automation system
                        and a computer with Arduino installed on it. </P><P>Once we have this two things ready, open the arduino code called “auto.ino” - you can get the

                        be a beta is because we would like to return the confluence percentage, as well as perform more
                        tests on the software.
