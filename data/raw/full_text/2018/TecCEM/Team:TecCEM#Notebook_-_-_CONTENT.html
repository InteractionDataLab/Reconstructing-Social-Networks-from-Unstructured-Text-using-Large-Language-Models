                                        the lysis method for E. coli we found that his lysis buffer was exactly the
                                        same as the one we previously encounter, for that we decided to give that
                                        buffer a try but with modifications according to our experience such as
                                        incubation with lysozyme.

                                        determine exhaust capacity of the prototype using only inclination and
                                        centrifugal force. The results obtained showed that an angle of 7.5Â° was
                                        necessary to remove most of the medium from the medium chamber. For that the
                                        creation of a base would be necessary for the removal of medium given those
                                        characteristics. We then proceed to modelate the base in CATIA and later we 3D
