This is our experiment section. Here we compile important protocols for the development of                         TecTissue, ranging from our bacterial transformation procedures to our cell proliferation                         assays.                         We also address cell culture maintenance and protein loaded chitosan nanoparticles.                         Here you may find the protocol for our growth factor delivery to damaged cells and how much                         harm can be inflicted in vitro.
