                        positive impact in Mexico and
                        all around the world. Keeping this aim in mind, we decided to analyze some of the issues that
                        our society
                        faces. After brainstorming and trying to identify the most relevant aspects of each proposal,
                        we all agreed
                        that burn injuries, representing the third cause of infant mortality in Mexico, was an issue
                        begging to be
                        worked out. In the first place, burn injuries embodied a challenge beyond the instant menace to
                        health. The
                        complexity of the concern lies in the complications it causes not only for the victim but for
                        the people around
                        them. Even though we were not fully aware of the consequences that arise from a burn injury, we
                        presumed that
                        the risk of infection, complications, physical and psychological aftermath, cost of treatment,
                        among others,
                        were some of the aspects in which our project could intervene.
                        Looking back to the first moments of TecTissue, we can tell that the project has evolved thanks
                        to all the
                        people who enriched our perspective and broadened our panorama to consider some aspects that,
                        otherwise, we
                        would never have thought of. It was then that we realized of the importance of integrated human
                        practices; in
                        short, they made us understand that Tec Tissue was no longer a project for a competition but
                        the hope of
                        thousands of people who believe in us.</P><DIV class="row" id="wound-healing-conf"><DIV class="col"><H1>Silver Integrated</H1><H2> Development of new drugs for wound healing conference by PhD. Gerardo Leyva Gómez from

                                of it. It made us realize about key factors such as pore size, applications of

                                the physician

                                improving it. Being
                                plastic surgeons have given them an up-close approach. They know about the pain that
                                patients
                                experience during
                                his healing process. With this in mind, they gave us some advice on the best
                                application
                                method, focusing on

                                administration.
                                They informed us about the main problems in patients besides the pain. One is that the
                                treatment is very
                                expensive due that recovery requires a lot of care, time and materials, this situation
                                often
                                gets worse and way
                                more expensive because of the lack of knowledge of the nurses attending the patients
                                properly.
                                Also, both
                                doctors shared with us the statistics of the cost of treatment and duration.
                                Additionally, they
                                suggested
                                focussing in just one kind of injury, in order to have better results.
                                Finally, Ph.D. Osabampo &amp; Ph.D. Pablo Rodríguez gave us his approval and congratulated
                                us
                                because of the impact
                                this project could have on the life of the patients.
                                Thanks to the meetings, we decided to focus on second-degree burns, reduce the leptin
                                concentration and the way

                                of the Burnt

                                and
                                adults who have
                                suffered burns. We had to book a hotel since we come from the State of Mexico and
                                traveled to
                                San Luis Potosi.
                                We arrived and got a brief tour of the facilities. After that, we had a meaningful
                                conversation
                                with the
                                director of the foundation, Gerardo Manuel García Lozano and his wife, Beatriz Eugenia
                                Hernández Contreras.
                                They explained to us the complications of treating with burned people as well as the
                                costs it
                                implied. One of
                                the most important aspects to consider when addressing the problem is the amount of
                                time
                                patients remain
                                hospitalized due to their burns. This represents one of the main opportunities for our
                                project.
                                The next day we taught a group of kids who were part of the foundation about synthetic
                                biology
                                and prepared
                                some activities to reinforce what they learned through games and interactive dynamics.
                                In the
                                end, we
                                approached the parents and families of the kids so that they could talk about their
                                experiences
                                and
                                testimonies. After the visit, we realized that, in addition to the statistics and
