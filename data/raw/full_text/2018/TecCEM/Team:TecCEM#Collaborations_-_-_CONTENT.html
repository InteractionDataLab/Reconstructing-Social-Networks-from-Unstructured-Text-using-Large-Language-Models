                        projects. But we did not want our relationship with the other teams to be based only on serious
                        technicalities, which is why we organized and participated in several activities to share all

                        to assist our Meetup, held on July 13th of the present year. We got the participation of 8
                        teams, these being teams from Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Tec-Chihuahua, Tec Monterrey and
                        TecMonterrey_GDL. Throughout the event, the members and representatives of each team had the
                        opportunity to present their project. These presentations were divided, some of them were
                        online and the other ones were face to face. The experts asked a series of questions making the
                        students aware of possible mistakes.

                        After the presentations, we had the opportunity to meet the other teams and interact with them.
                        With this activity, we had the chance to participate and encourage collaborations between the
                        teams.

                        specialists was crucial for the proper development of the projects, and beyond the
                        scientific issues, we were able to get to know each other, get along and create bonds of

                        difficulties may come up during this period of time. While developing our projects, the
                        team Tec-Chihuahua and our team had some struggles. After a long time of working hard, but
                        not having results, we discovered that our IDT parts did not work properly. At that moment
                        we started to examine the problem, in order to find a solution together. We found out that
                        our oligos were missing base pairs before the suffix and after the prefix, affecting the
                        correct function of the restriction enzymes during ligation. Therefore, during a brainstorm
                        between the two teams, Tec CEM decided to create specific primers for the suffix and
                        prefix, which add this extra pairs when our parts are amplificated. So, we designed and
                        studied the best protocol to implement them and sent the information with the primers to
                        Tec-Chihuahua for them to continue with their amazing project. By this making, they
                        achieved results for their project. </P><P>So a problem that both of our teams had was worked out together for us to develop our
                        projects and succeed at the competition. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row mb-3" id="bioluminati"><DIV class="col-12"><H1>iGEM TEAM Bioluminati IIT Kanpur Part BBa_K1629002 and Survey</H1><P>Our planet is begging for help and each day that goes by our ecological footprint grows

                        Being conscious of this problem, when they asked for the previous iGEM TecCEM from 2015
                        part (BBa_K1629002) the sdsA Alkyl sulfatase enzyme from Pseudomona, which is capable of
                        degrading SDS, we were happy to share it with them.
                        
                        Also, we had the pleasure of answering a survey they posted in the iGEM
                        Teams/Collaborations page called“Survey to Combat Water Pollution”, this information helped
                        them to understand what actions are taken around the world to prevent water pollution.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row mb-3" id="washington"><DIV class="col-12"><H1>Washington</H1><P>People may perceive science as a complicated and boring topic, but the Washington iGEM Team
                        decided to prove this as a common misconception. To achieve this goal, the team designed a
                        synthetic biology booklet meant for kids. This book is easy to understand and states the
                        importance of science through interesting experiments and fun explanations. However, in
                        order to succeed, our team had the task of fully translating it to Spanish, with the
                        objective to reach a much wider audience, including all the Spanish speaking countries.
                        This also was done with the intention of giving them some feedback about the booklet. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row mb-3" id="chile"><DIV class="col-12"><H1>UChile_Biotec iGEM LATAM</H1><P>How would you describe iGEM to a stranger?

                        UChile_Biotec decided that it was time to show the world what does it means to belong to
                        this community.

                        us to overcome obstacles throughout the development of our project. Even though people may
                        consider mistakes as a failure, for iGEM Nebraska, it’s all the other way around, or at
                        least that is the impression we got from the collaboration they organized: A scrapbook that
                        contained and displayed with pride the worst electrophoresis gels of the participating
                        teams. Thanks to the scrapbook, teams like ours presented some of the mistakes made during
                        the competition. This collaboration inspired us to do our best and changed our minds to
                        understand mistakes as opportunities to improve.
