Overview
To accomplish our project objective several recombinant proteins must be produced in order to                         analyze                         their effects on a co culture of fibroblasts (L929) and mesenchymal cells after an in vitro                         burn assay.                         To evaluate the efficiency of the treatment, a measurement of the proliferation rate was                         performed                         using LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) as an analysis metabolite. Given that our treatment involves                         the                         usage of a growth factor, the rate at which this protein is released into the medium is                         critical to                         avoid adverse effects in the cellular line (such as cancer), for that reason a nano                         encapsulation with                         chitosan was also performed to control the rate at which our growth factor is released.

What happened?
We started ligating parts, no bands of expected size were observed but we attributed this                             fact to low sensitivity of agarose gels, so we proceeded with transformation and protein                             induction. Nevertheless, we realized that consistent results were not achieved (bad protein                             migration rates, sometimes no induction band could be observed). [Unfortunately, we                             invested a lot of time on this period]
Then we started thinking that our parts did not had the necessary extra nucleotides for                             proper cleavage of restriction enzymes and what we were truly observing was the effect of                             star activity and inappropriate ligation, resulting in non specific plasmids which did not                             contained our whole part but conferred the bacteria antibiotic resistance.
How did we solved it?
We designed primers that incorporate the necessary nucleotides into our parts. Thus, we started                         having proper migrations of project parts and posterious transformations and protein production                         of BBLEP.
How should we improve it?
By including better protein reporters for the screening of transformed, functional bacteria                         colonies.
Our proyect is divided into three sections which are the following:
Phase 1: E. coli transformation
Phase 2: Protein production
Phase 3: Test in cellular line
Phase 1 E. coli transformation
Once our IDT synthesis arrived, we set the objective of ligating the composite parts of                             tenascin ( BBa_K2719005 ) [also called                             BBTNC], leptin ( BBa_K2719009 ) [also                             called BBLEP] and                             collagen ( BBa_K2719007 ) [also                             called BBCOL], into an RFC10 compatible psB1C3 iGEM plasmid                             for future transformations into E. coli. We had several transformation attempts                             (Figure 1),                             most of the times there are no adequate migrations patterns achieved. We                             carried on with                             bacterial transformation and protein production, as we thought that bands of                             ligation could                             not be seen given the agarose sensibility, surprisingly bacterial colonies                             (either E. coli BL21(DE3) and DH5 alpha ) were seen (Figure 2) in selective medium but no                             constant protein                             production could be achieved (Go to phase 2for more information). After                             many failed                             attempts and a lot of time invested, we suspected that maybe ligations were                             failing due to                             the absence of “close to the end DNA cleavage nucleotides” (needed for                             restriction                             cutting). To solve the problem previously mentioned, primers were designed to                             tackle this                             problems using iGEM prefix and suffix sequences as template for amplification.                             We amplified                             BBLEP (Figure 3) and ligated it into psB1C3 finally obtaining the expected                             sizes at each                             step. Thus with this methodology we could resolve the difficulties for BBLEP                             and achieving                             a transformation in BL21(DE3) (Figure 4), due to timewise limitations and the                             embedded DNA                             synthesize problems, BBCOL and BBTNC could not be tested with this methodology.                             Future                             plans include applying that methodology to those parts and transforming into                             respective                             bacteria strains.

Phase 2 Protein production
After doing transformation into E. coli BL21 (DE3) we started the production and                             purification of our protein of interests. This phase was a key factor for the demonstration                             of the functionality of our project. First, we obtained polyacrylamide gels that had clear                             signs of maximum induction of our proteins at 5 hours after IPTG induction. The results                             that we obtained were inconsistent between several repetitions of the induction.
After that observation several hypotheses were formulated in order to explain those events,                             the first one was that the synthesis sequence had several errors, which made the peptide                             product unstable, and an easy target for degradation. This hypothesis was mainly supported                             by the apparition of the protein at 5h after induction, but its complete disappearance                             after 16 hours, specifically TCD that needs a protein fusion to improve its stability and                             reduce the rate of degradation.
The second hypothesis was that the used strain (E. coli BL21 (DE3)) was mislabeled,                             therefore the transformation and induction were on strains unable to produce RNApol T7.                             This idea was discarded after several experiments were made on fresh strains, obtaining the                             same inconsistent results. Even though the results continued to be inconsistent, with the                             fresh strains some improvement was made. Tenascin was observed for the first time on                             SDS-PAGE after 5h of induction (see figure 5). Also a Dot Blot was performed in order to                             evaluate the presence of Tenascin and Leptin using the His-TAG (see figure 7).
The third and last hypothesis was that an error on the synthesis meant that there were not                             enough nucleotides for allowing the restriction enzymes (EcoRI and PstI) to work properly,                             reducing ligation efficiency. In order to test this hypothesis new primers were developed,                             those primers after amplification with PCR, added extra nucleotides to the prefix and                             suffix o the parts promoting the properly work of the enzymes.
Finally, since E.coli BL21 (DE3) has a protein that migrates at the same levels [1]                             as those                             expected for leptin, a Western Blot was performed in order to get more specific results.                             Using an anti-His antibodies we were able to determined the presence and the production of                             the leptin. In order to do this, a inoculum of transformedE.coli BL21 was induced at                             a                             concentration of 1mM IPTG. The samples were lizated utilizing RIPA buffer and were loaded                             on an gradient 5%-20% BioRad SDS-PAGE. This was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane                             and incubated with anti-His antibodies. The results were positive, obtaining bands (where                             the antibody binds) at a size close to 17 kDa, similar to the expected leptin molecular                             weight (see figure 8). So the production of leptin is proposed, but further experimentation                             is required to standardize its production.

Conditions: 1080 volts for 20 minutes, 120 volts 60 minutes.
Objective: Determine the presence of protein from BBLEP (BBa_K2719009)                                 and                                 BBTCD (BBa_K2719005) in protein producer strain E. coli BL21 (DE3)
Description: Crude lysate (30 uL + 10 uL laemmli buffer) coming from                                 transformed BL21 (DE3) strains and induced with 1 mM IPTG for different hours at 37                                 Celsius                                 degrees were loaded onto polyacrylamide gel and runned with SDS-Tris-Gly buffer

Protein Ladder
Analysis: The gel has a constant band pattern among lanes, which                                 represents the native proteins of BL21 (DE3) strain. On the other hand, a single band                                 is highly ovestanding which can be seen in lane 7, here a single pattern band between                                 25 and 37 kDa correspond to a possible apparition of BBTCD protein, which has a                                 theoretical weight of 35.1 kDa, the band stand as very likely candidate as its form and                                 luminosity correspond to a common protein band derived from an IPTG expression,                                 nevertheless, at 15 hours the same part (lane 1) shows no sign of the protein, this can                                 be explained as the lost of function of IPTG given by continuous exposure to high                                 temperatures and consequently loss of protein production possibility and gradual                                 degradation of existing protein. For BBLEP no sign of protein production could be                                 recorded. More analysis to BBTCD must be done to corroborate the existence of protein,                                 and a restructure of troubleshooting for BBLEP must be done to create better results of                                 production..

Conditions: 80 volts for 20 minutes, 120 volts 60 minutes.
Objective: Determine the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain that produce                                 the                                 protein BBTCD (BBa_K2719005).
Description: Crude lysate (30 uL + 10 uL laemmli buffer) coming from                                 transformed BL21 (DE3) strains and induced with 1 mM IPTG for different hours at 37                                 Celsius degrees were loaded onto polyacrylamide gel and runned with SDS-Tris-Gly                                 buffer.
The samples were charged in the following order:

Protein Ladder
Analysis:Analysis: A single band is highly overstanding which can be                                 seen in lane 3, here a single band of 25 kDa that confirm the possible presence of                                 BBTCD protein in the BBTCD V2 strain, furthermore there is an inconsistency in this                                 line because the theoretical weight of TCD is 35.1 kDa. Obtaining an unexpected                                 molecular weight for BBTCD as a fusion protein, made us suggested that the protein                                 sequence is incomplete. This aceveración can explain the reason why there is no                                 presence of BBTCD at 16 hours of induction. The GST as a fusion protein helps for the                                 stability of the entire protein. Its absence difficult to have the protein in the                                 stable form and it is possibly degraded.

Analysis: After the inconsistent results obtained in the                                 polyacrylamide gels, a Dot Blot was executed. Observation of colored points in                                 positions 3, 5 an 7 gives a positive result in presence of recombinant proteins which                                 contain a histidine tag, in positions 4, 6 and 8 an even more colored point is                                 detected, this confirm that the production of protein increases significantly after 5                                 hours of induction. On the other hand positions 1 and 2, which accounts for negative                                 control, resolves that E. coli BL21 (DE3) does not produces endogenous native                                 proteins                                 with a high content of histidine tags that could be misunderstood as our protein, this                                 event partially eliminates false positive results. Meanwhile position 9, which account                                 for positive control, shows no coloured point, this effect must be due to the high                                 degree of dilution that we applied to the positive control (1:1000), also there is no                                 visualization of the mark that normally happens when the sample dries, thus we can                                 conclude that our positive control, which was a recombinant protein from E coli, was                                 not in optimal state. This result complicates the final decision about our protein                                 production, for that more dot blots or even western blots must be applied for a better                                 confirmation of results.

Experiment: Western blot
Matrix: Nitrocellulose membrane
Conditions: Incubation with Anti His tag antibody (dilution 1:1000)                                 for overnight.
Objective: Determine the presence of protein from newly ligated BBLEP                                 (BBa_K2719009) in protein producer strain E. coliBL21 (DE3).
Description: CCrude lysate coming from transformed BL21 (DE3) strains and induced with 0.5 mM IPTG for 5 hours at 37 Celsius degrees were loaded onto                                 nitrocellulose membrane (3 uL) and incubated with Anti His tag antibody coupled with a                                 fluorochrome reporter. At left SDS-PAGE 15% gel revealed with Coomassie blue for 30                                 minutes, at right western blot.
The samples were charged in the following order:
Molecular weight ladder Spectra.
BBLEP (At 0 hours of induction)
BBLEP (At 2 hours of induction)
BBLEP (At 4 hours of induction)
BBLEP (At 6 hours of induction)
Analysis:As is observed on the SDS-PAGE, is almost impossible to                                 distinguish between the native E.coli BL21 (DE3) protein and leptin, as both proteins                                 migrate in a similar way, therefore both bands render undistinguishable. To overcome                                 this problem, a Western Blot was performed using an anti-His antibody, taking advantage                                 that leptin contains a 6xHis Tag and the native protein does not, so the antibody will                                 only bind to leptin. The results after the incubation with the antibodies determined                                 not only the presence of a peptide of around 17 kDa with an histidine Tag, presumably                                 leptin. But also as the width of the band increased as the induction time increased                                 (for times 0, 2h, 4h and 6h), thus suggesting a successful IPTG induction of the part.
As is shown on the Western Blot (see figure 8) recombinant leptin was successfully produced                             by our parts in E.coli BL21 (DE3), but the degree of purity obtained was not                             sufficient for                             its usage on a cell line. But, as a proof of concept was necessary to demonstrate the                             effect of recombinant leptin on cell proliferation in burn damaged tissue. Then, we decided                             to use high degree of purity commercially available leptin for our assays on cell lines. In                             this way, the functionabillity of our project is demonstrated on a real experimental                             manner, minimizing the effect of external variables (such as contamination from undesired                             components).
Phase 3: Nanoencapsulation and test in cellular line
As a delivery vehicle was needed protein-loaded chitosan nanoparticles were prepared by                             ionic gelation method. For a correct standardization of the encapsulation protocol, we used                             BSA as protein. BSA is often employed for concentration measurements in protein assays,                             including encapsulation efficiency and protein release in a solution of loaded                             nanoparticles.
Chitosan nanoparticles were prepared with a pH of 5.0 since BSA has an isoelectric point of                             4.7 at 25 °C with TPP polyanion under mild conditions following our standardized protocol.
What we expected:
We wanted to create an efficient drug delivery method that would regulate leptin liberation                             into the cells as an uncontrolled amount of leptin can cause a swelling reaction. By                             standardizing the nanoparticle particle size, particle count, encapsulation efficiency, and                             protein release behavior in a physiological pH solution we expected to accurately predict a                             cell proliferation increase in treated cell lines with nanoparticles against non-treated.
What we achieved: Characterization of nanoparticles
For the encapsulation of BSA at pH at 5.0 a particle analysis in NanoSight NS300 to obtain                             the particle size distribution was performed. A dot graph for a triplicate analysis is                             presented below.
Particle size and particle count
Particles were analyzed in NanoSight NS300, from which we obtained 127.8 nm as mean particle                             size with a broad standard deviation of 90.1 nm. NanoSight NS300 displays a video when                             analyzing a sample volume of nanoparticle solution, which we include here .

Analysis:
Some chitosan nanoparticles displayed a bigger diameter, this might be a result from the                             swelling of chitosan layer and aggregation of single particles while dispersed in water,                             causing a detection of several bigger particles, shifting the mean value and standard                             deviation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used as a second method of                             confirmation, in which nanoparticle morphology was observed. We think this difference is                             caused by the sample treatment required for TEM, that enables adequate particle                             distribution to observe them individually. A mean size by TEM was determined to be 27.7 nm.
Encapsulation efficiency
A Bradford assay was performed to determine the protein encapsulation percentage in order to                             evaluate the efficiency of the protocol used to form loaded chitosan nanoparticles. The                             recovery of protein from the encapsulation procedure was 42% at the stated conditions.
Protein release behavior
We established the relation between the amount of protein released by nanoparticles with                             respect to time, measuring the protein concentration at 0, 2, 4, 12, 18 and 24 hrs.                             Nanoparticles were incubated at 37 °C and 100 rpm suspended in PBS pH 7.4 to estimate how                             they would behave in a physiological medium. After 24 hours almost 50% of the protein was                             released.

Leptin loaded chitosan nanoparticles action in cell lines
As the main target of this project was to prove protein release from a chitosan                             encapsulation that would increase cell proliferation in a cell line, we encapsulated leptin                             under the same conditions. Afterward, leptin-chitosan nanoparticles were tested in L929                             fibroblasts cell line which was damaged with a hot solution at different degrees. For every                             degree of damage, a well was supplied with 3.4 ng/mL of leptin growth factor. Results                             analyzed after 72 h are presented below. Commercial leptin growth factor effect on burned                             L929 fibroblasts is demonstrated through the performance of this experiment.
Cell line burn assay standardization
Burn injuries represent a serious issue that involves pathophysiological changes, it is                             important to develop new mechanisms to test the viability of improvements or new                             treatments. For that reason,we decided to perform an assay which consisted of analysing                             cell proliferation after submitting L-929 cell line to a burning procedure. This allowed us                             to monitor if the evaluation of our treatment through this mechanism was feasible.
After setting different exposure times (15, 30, 45 and 60 seconds) to which each well would                             be exposed to HBSS (Hank solution) at 60ºC, we registered the results comparing the damage                             taken by the cell culture in each of the wells. We can conclude that the longer the cells                             are exposed to the solution, the more damage they take and the less cellular density is                             observed. This analysis allowed us to proceed with the evaluation of TecTissue performing                             another burn assay to apply later the treatment we designed. The importance of the                             standardization lies in the fact that it establishes the way in which we will perform the                             following assays to determine the efficiency of our project and set the basis for a more                             specific complex burn model.
In this in vitro burn model, it is possible to observe the increasing cell injury and                             significant changes in cell viability and morphology in relation to the time they were exposed to the hot HBSS.
Figure 11. Decrease in cellular density according to the                                 exposure time to hot HBSS.                                 NB - No burn
In conclusion, the exposure of the culture to hot HBSS caused visible damage to the cells,                             causing possible cell necrosis and cell detachment of cell culture flasks. The different                             times employed are directly proportional to the harm taken by the culture and therefore the                             number of cells is visibly reduced. This assay allows researchers to perform in vitro                             analysis of burn process and the nature of the procedure makes it a feasible and                             reproductive alternative to study the cellular and molecular alterations throughout the                             burn process. In perspective, we could measure necrosis, cell viability, LDH, among others.
Burn assay with treatment
Once the burn assay was standardized, it was time to prove the efficiency of TecTissue. For                             that reason, we performed another burn assay with the times stated before but applying the                             hot HBSS to a co-culture of L-929 fibroblasts and human mesenchymal stem cells. Since our                             project is based on the combination of several factors, we decided to test the activity of                             each throughout the regeneration of the cultures.The compatibility of both cell lines                             allowed us to perform the procedure without any complication. However, due to the                             importance of the procedure, an MTT assay was performed additionally to ensure the accuracy                             of the results obtained and to legitimate the conclusions reached after the assay. The                             following pictures show the amount of cells depending on three factors:
Time of exposure to hot HBSS
Treatment given after burning the co-culture
Chitosan nanoparticles with leptin encapsulated
Empty chitosan nanoparticles
Co-culture of fibroblasts and mesenchymal cells
According to the figures shown, the damage taken by the cells is visible related to the                             amount of time they were exposed to the hot solution; however, in order to determine at a                             molecular level the viability of the cells remaining, we performed an MTT assay with the                             purpose of relating the proliferation of the cells with the efficiency of the treatment.
Figure 12. Proliferation Assay in different hot HBSS                                 exposure. A and B; 48hrs and 72hrs post burn assay, with Chitosan charged with leptin                                 and empty nanopaticles (NP). C; comparison of proliferation with leptin Chitosan NP.
This figure compares the proliferation of the co-culture when one of the samples is treated                             with all the elements that form part of TecTissue (collagen, heparan, leptin nanoparticles)                             and the other with empty nanoparticles. The graph shows that the dosified release of leptin                             increases the proliferation and regeneration of the cells while the ones that received the                             treatment without the leptin did not have the same response. This behaviour is due to the                             activity of the leptin, which is slowly released into the matrix allowing cells to absorb                             it and enhance their metabolic activity to proliferate. Nevertheless, we can observe that                             empty chitosan nanoparticles may cause some response.

After analysing the results obtained from the MTT assay, we confirmed our hypothesis and                             observed that cells treated with TecTissue were indeed metabolic enhanced and confluent                             compared to the ones that were not treated. Some aspects to consider are that even though                             the leptin, heparan, and collagen were studied, none of them were evaluated separately,                             which means that further analysis should be performed to determine the activity of each                             element within the treatment. As stated in the corresponding sections, chitosan, heparan                             and collagen each play a specific role in our project and the combination of them represent                             at first glance, a good opportunity to develop new treatments for burn injuries. Even                             though we demonstrated the efficiency of TecTissue, it is important to mention that within                             72 hours, the confluence of both conditions (charged and empty NP), present no significant                             differences. This means that the effects of our treatment are more visible within the first                             48 hours. Since confluence of both wells were similar, we can say that TecTissue is a                             feasible treatment but within the short term. Further analysis should be made to determine                             whether it is possible to increase the efficiency of the treatment considering the areas of                             opportunity identified after the assay.
Another thing that needs to be sorted out, is the relation between the co-culture and the                             damage induced, with the presence or absence of leptin within the nanoparticles because the                             results obtained with the microscope suggest that the chitosan alone could plays a key role                             in the regeneration and proliferation of the fibroblasts.
Figure 14. Similar confluence in both conditions 72                                 hours post burn assay.
Furthermore, it is necessary to determine the efficiency of the project, measuring                             metabolites such as Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), proliferation cytokines like tissue growth                             factor beta, which is known to be released by the mesenchymal stem cells due to the action                             of leptin.
The amount of cells that can be seen in each well of the plate are directly related to the                             time it was exposed to the hot HBSS, the treatment employed and the time it was left                             incubated afterwards. For that reason, it is important to describe the role of each element                             of the treatment and its influence in the regeneration of the cells: Collagen and heparan                             as the scaffold, leptin as the growth factor and chitosan as the vehicle that regulated the                             release of the drug. The combination of all these, allowed cells to react positively and                             enhance the proliferation, increasing its rate and potentiating the healing process.
Cell culture in BOB
Part of the evaluation of TecTissue consisted in testing the feasibility of our hardware,                             which was designed with the purpose of automatizing 2D/3D cell cultures. In order to                             evaluate if BOB is useful, we decided to perform a co-culture within it and analyse if                             cells were able to adhere to the PDMS surface and proliferate. The following pictures                             display how cells behaved when cultivated in BOB. To achieve our goal, we had to adequate                             the hardware with the molecules necessary for the correct adherence of the cells. In other                             words, we tested several combinations of the elements that comprise TecTissue. For example,                             a BOB with a scaffold made out of PDMS supplemented with collagen and heparan. The same                             study was performed with other combinations of said elements and removing the PDMS. After                             incubating for at least one day, we photo documented and recorded the results observed in a                             microscope employing fluorescence to ensure cells were correctly adhered to the synthetic                             matrix.
The results demonstrate that porous-collagen-based scaffolds membrane are effective for cell                             culture and tissue engineering. The images obtained from the epifluorescence microscope                             with a mitochondrial dye allow us to conclude that employing these elements it is possible                             to perform a co-culture. This is supported by the immunofluorescence assay that allowed us                             to see the correct attachment of the cells. Further analysis should be performed to enhance                             the efficiency of the PDMS and increase the cellular adhesion.
