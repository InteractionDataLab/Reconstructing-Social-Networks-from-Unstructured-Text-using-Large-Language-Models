Introduction
Variation of Leptin Curve
Stoichiometry Cell growth
As wound healing is a very complex and dynamic process there has always been an                         interest in predicting how cell types and growth factors would interact when treating a wound                         as it involves the relation of these elements.
Leptin stimulates the proliferation of several cell types like myofibroblast, which                         accept leptin into Ob receptors and when activated have been shown produce TGF-B1, a protein that controls proliferation and is also a regulator of leptin expression. Mesenchymal cells                         induce cell migration in a L929 fibroblast culture (Walter, Wright, Fuller, MacNeil, and                         Johnson, 2010) via the expression of TGF-B1, chemokines IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, among other healing                         mediators, which keratinocytes and fibroblasts receive.

As it is of high importance to accurately predict how growth factors will affect the cells and                         the medium, iGEM TecCEM team proposed a mathematical model which aim was to predict the effect                         that leptin will have in cell proliferation after being released by chitosan nanoparticles, the                         amount of leptin that will be absorbed by the cells and the amount remaining in the medium.

Variation of Leptin Curve
A simple system of differential equations was used to model the above.
Where
k1= Degradation leptin
k2= Leptin adsorption fibroblast
x2= Concentration of leptin in chitosan
x1= Concentration of leptin inside the cell
The employed equations were created based on the physical behavior of leptin's dispersion, as                         shown next:
Equation 1 represents the variation of concentration of leptin in time; the liberation of                             leptin towards the medium at a constant velocity "k1" considering the amount of leptin left                             on the medium and the leptin adsorbed by cells.
Equation 2 represents the amount of leptin adsorbed by the cells at a constant velocity                             "k2" with an overall performance Yxs used to harmonize units.
In order to solve the equation system with the form y'= f(t,y) ODE Matlab Solver was                             employed using the proposed algorithm and establishing initial conditions:

The study of drug release dynamic aims to understand the process of drug characteristics in                             the human body.
Summary of the functions:
If we plot the system, the following graph represents the kinetics of leptin,                                     simulating the rate of reduction of the leptin in the nanoparticles a time x while                                     this rate is relating with the adsorption rate of the leptin by the cells. The blue                                     line represents the first event and the red line represents the adsorption rate.

If we consider a third parameter, using the following equation:
Equation 3 represents the amount of leptin that is released at the medium at a                                     constant velocity "k3" and then remains static in the medium.
The Matlab code is shows below
Figure 5. Matlab code
The graph presents the kinetics of leptin, representing the rate of reduction at                                     a time x while simulating at the same time the increase of leptin in the medium                                     and the rate of adsorption by the cells.

The blue line represents the decreasing rate of the leptin, the red line                                     represents the adsorption rate and the yellow one is the concentration of the                                     leptin in the medium.
Stoichiometry Cell growth
Additionally, we sought to have the relationship between a measurable product to                                     have a direct relationship with cell proliferation while in the presence and                                     absence of leptin. For this, a general stoichiometric analysis was carried out                                     for the cell growth reaction. This method was used because it is possible to                                     follow the assertion of all the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen atoms and                                     all the other elements that are consumed during the cell growth process, and                                     then these atoms are incorporated again for the formation of new cells and                                     products, that is to say, taking into account the matter and energy balances.
If one considers the components that are present in greater quantities and there                                     is a presence of unique products formed, the following aerobic cell growth                                     reaction can be written:
Without leptin
With leptin
Glucose was considered as the main source of carbon and glutamine as the                                         main source of nitrogen. On the other hand, lactic acid and ammonia as                                         unique products, in addition to carbon dioxide and water.
For the resolution of this system, the following parameters were considered:
Yps = 0.1973 g glu/g glut
Yxs = 0.17 g glu/g lactic acid
Analogously, the respiratory rate of the fibroblasts was considered, with                                         the ratio of moles of CO2 produced per moles of O2 consumed.
RQ=0.97=d/a
Given all the above, a 7x7 matrix was made to obtain the stoichiometric                                         coefficients.
Figure 7. Solve of the matrix in                                                 Matlab.
Giving the following results:
1 mol Glucose
a = 0.2432 mol Glutamine
b = 4.6974 mol Oxygene
c = 1.3533 mol Cells
d = 0.3400 mol Lactic acid
e = 0.1616 mol Ammonia
f = 4.8427 mol Carbon Dioxide
g = 4. 7559 mol Water
Obtaining a ratio of 0.34 moles of lactic acid per 1.2533 moles of cells.
By adding leptin to the medium, the increase in cell proliferation can be                                         observed, giving the initial conditions of grams of leptin per grams of                                         glucose in the medium.
Figure 8. Solve of the matrix 2                                                 in Matlab.
Giving the following results:
1 mol Glucose
a = 0.2432 mol Glutamine
b = 0.97 mol Oxygene
c = 0.0010 mol Leptine
d = 2.5112 mol Cells
e = 0.3400 mol Lactic Acid
f = 0.0927 mol Ammonia
g = 4. 4348 mol Carbon Dioxide
h = 4.4400 mol Water
Resulting in a ratio of 0.0927 moles of lactic acid per 2.5112 moles of                                         cells.
