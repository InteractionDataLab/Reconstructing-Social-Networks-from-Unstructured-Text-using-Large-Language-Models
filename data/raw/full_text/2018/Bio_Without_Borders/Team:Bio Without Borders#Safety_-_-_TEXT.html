Safe Project Design
Since our team had never before competed in iGEM, we decided to stick to very safe species: horseshoe crabs, E. coli K12 strains, and the industrial yeast Pichia pastoris for our project.
For all cloning we chose non-pathogenic chassis organisms
We chose to express single proteins rather than pathways and focus on diagnostics rather than therapeutics
For our proof-of-concept experiment we used E.coli K12 rather than native E. coli as a source of endotoxins
Safe Lab Work
We wore personal protective gear appropriate to the organisms and chemicals we worked with, and were careful to clean up after experiments with 70% ethanol on the benchtops. when we had to transport our Pichia pastoris to Columbia University for electroporation, we carried it in capped tubes sealed in a styrofoam box.
