Dr. Ellen Jorgensen is the president of Biotech Without Borders, an nonprofit lab dedicated to science education, outreach and innovation. She has mentored five gold medal-winning iGEM teams since 2011. Each year she swears she will never do it again, but like childbirth the memory of the pain fades and she signs up for another year.
Steve Oszust
After seemingly countless years of education, and 21 years of teaching science, Steve can honestly say that he still hasn't learned enough. Steve's students are constantly trying to educate him. When asked by students, where he is from, Steve always tells them that he's from the deep south- South Bronx, that is.
Dr. Julie Wolf
