Introduction
The interlab study was conducted to provide a standardized protocol for measurements of absorbance and fluorescence. We initially had trouble getting our Fluostar Galaxy to work as the program had certain constraints during the setup. Once we familiarized ourselves with how it functioned, we conducted the protocol using black 96 well plates. The first trial of the study was not accepted due to the fluorescence and absorbance readings being too similar between the test devices. The study was conducted once more, but with black wells and transparent bottom plates instead of using fully transparent plates. This submission gave outcomes closer to theoretical results, and was a successful submission.
