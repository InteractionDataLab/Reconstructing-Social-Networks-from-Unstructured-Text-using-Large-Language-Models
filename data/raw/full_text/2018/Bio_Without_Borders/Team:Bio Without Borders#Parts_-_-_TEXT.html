We focused on a simple design for a replacement for the LAL test. Factor C self-cleaves and activates a proteolytic function when it encounters endotoxin. Although other teams have attempted to clone the Factor C gene and add it to the registry, they did not succeed. Our Factor C open reading frame part is the first instance of this protein being deposited in the registry. The second part of our system is composed of GFP and a cellulose binding domain (CBD) linked together by a short amino acid sequence that contains the target site for the proteolytic activity of activated Factor C. We also had ambitions to do this with RFP, and so some of the parts in our table did not get made.
