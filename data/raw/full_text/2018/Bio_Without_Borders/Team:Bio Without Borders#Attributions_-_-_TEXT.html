JUDGING FORM

This page shows how we divided and conquered the various aspects of our project. Each member played a valuable role in advancing our project and making sure what needed to get done got done, whether it was coding for the website or doing actual wet lab work. We couldn't have done it without any of these members.
Wet Lab Work
There were two main components to the wet lab part of our project. One dealt with creating a functioning Factor C component and the other with creating a functioning GFP and Cellulose Binding Domain. We would then attach these, however, the first step was to make sure the parts were functioning.
Factor C Work
Ademola, Alyanna, Blacki, Ivan, Joy, Lizavetta, Marcela, Minaal
For this part of the lab, we attempted to create the Factor C component of our genetic pathway. Factor C is the protein in the Horseshoe crab that clots around any exterior foreign entities in the crab's system. This is perhaps the most crucial part of our genetic system because it is what does the clotting around endotoxins in the pharmaceutical industry.
GFP Cellulose Binding Site
Blacki, Ibrahim, Joe
For this part of the lab, we attempted to create the GFP Cellulose Binding Domain component of our genetic pathway. This component is important because by attaching the GFP to the Factor C gene using the CBD, we will have a visual indicator for when the Factor C is produced and starts working.
Developing the Genomic Privacy Forum
Joy
The Genomic Privacy Forum focused on the topic of Genomic Privacy and how it can affect us. We discussed topics involving multiple cases of genomic privacy, one of which was the project "Stranger Visions" by artist Heather Dewey, in which she collected DNA samples from food scraps and other locations on the streets of various places. She then used that DNA to reconstruct the faces of the people who had left the garbage there to show that our genetic information is not as confidential as we often think it is. /p>
Coding the Website
Joe, Joy, Minaal
These members helped create our website to display all of our information, our findings and our protocols!
