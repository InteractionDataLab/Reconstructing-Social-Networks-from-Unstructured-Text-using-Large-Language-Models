Collaborations
Teams we collaborated with!
ColumbiaNYC team
The ColombiaNYC team is housed in Dr. Harris Wang's lab at Columbia Medical Research Center. We needed access to an electroporator to transform our Pichia pastoris. Team members allowed our team to use their electroporation device, and they also showed us how to correctly use it. This was critical our project.
New York City High School team
We allowed students and mentors from team access to our lab in the fall, since they lost lab access near the end of their project. This allowed them to complete their project.
iGem Team Meet Up
We invited ColumbiaNYC and CUNY-Kingsborough team to a meetup at our lab where we introduced ourselves and discussed our projects. We Had a great time, and brainstormed and coordinated collaboration efforts.
Makerere University team
We video chatted with this team from Uganda to gauge how our project would work in other countries with different infrastructure. They did a survey for us of the needs of health professionals in their country for alternative ways to test injectables for endotoxins. In turn, we helped them brainstorm an experiment to test an existing part for the bronze medal criteria. We are also providing them with lodging during iGEM.
