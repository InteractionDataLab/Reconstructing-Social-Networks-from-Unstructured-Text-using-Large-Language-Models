This year, as we worked on our project, we also considered what sort of effects our final diagnostic product would have besides on the horseshoe crab population. Upon further research, we discovered a few different assays that worked in a similar fashion to ours, however, most of the assays use equipment that is both expensive and highly-inaccessible. We decided to make our assay a simple, user-friendly tool in order to increase its accessibility. Once we completed this, we wondered how it would affect and if it would even be applicable to our larger society. We decided to contact the Ugandan iGEM team to learn if our diagnostic tool would provide a useful additional tool in regions that don't have the same access to resources in order to provide the best of healthcare, and if having an easy diagnostic tool would reduce the cost of the importation of the endotoxin test.
The following questionnaire was prepared by Bio Without Borders concerning their project and sent to iGEM Makerere University Team to help collect data concerning the questions provided in. The questionnaire was presented to field veterinary practitioners among them there is a professor of Pathology and these were their answers concerning the questionnaire.
Question.1. Do you use injectable drugs in your medical Practice?
YES.
Question 2. Are the injectable drugs/ medicine sourced locally in Africa or imported from other areas of the world?
Imported and locally sourced.
Question 3. Have you ever had a problem with an injectable that was contaminated?
Not sure.
Question 4. Would a simple and inexpensive quality control test for endotoxin contamination in injectable formulations be useful either for your practice or for enabling the manufacturing of injectable drugs locally?
YES. Since we are not sure if these injectable drugs are always contaminated with endotoxins or not it will be a good idea to test them to enable us have a better stand and better the lives of animals and people.
