Name: Alexandra Sandéhn Educational Programme and semester: I am studying my second year of Biomedical Engineering. Why did you apply for iGEM and what do you hope to gain from iGEM? I applied to iGEM to challenge myself, learn new things, meet new people and have a reason to stay in Linköping during the summer. What do you like to do outside of iGEM? Outside of iGEM, I have a loving relationship with my bed. I have also filled my two-room-apartment with plants and flowers which I do my best to keep alive in my spare time.
