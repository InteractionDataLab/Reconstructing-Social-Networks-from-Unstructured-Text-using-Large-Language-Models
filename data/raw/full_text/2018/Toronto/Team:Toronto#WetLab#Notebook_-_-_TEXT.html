Double     transformation of pSB1C3+RFP     and pET28a+arg1 into MG1655ΔlacI (electroporation)
Hypothesis: If we get growth on the positive control, LB+KAN, and LB+CAM plates     with transformed cells, but not the double antibiotic plate, we can     say that either the plasmids are incompatible, or the double     antibiotic plate concentration is too high.

serial      dilution was performed and the plate was read
shaken      5s at amplitude = 2
excitation      = 485nm
emission      = 525nm
optimal      gain used = 75
read      from bottom of plate
The      graph obtained from this experiment indicated an error, will repeat      tomorrow
Interlab     transformation overnight cultures
16      tubes with 5mL of LB and 5μLCAM
2      colonies were taken from each of the 8 plates (2B, 2D, 2F, 2H, 2J,      2L, 2N, 2P)
tubes      placed in the shaker overnight at 37° at 250rpm
Observations:
Double     transformation of pSB1C3+RFP     and pET28a+arg1 into MG1655ΔlacI
no      colonies on negative control plate
no      colonies on 100μL,      200μL,      or 300μLplates
100μL     double transformation of pSB1C3+RFP (10pg/μL) and pET28a+arg1 in     MG1655ΔlacI (negative control) on LB+CAM+KAN

300μL     double transformation of pSB1C3+RFP (10pg/μL) and pET28a+arg1 in     MG1655ΔlacI on LB+CAM+KAN
Potential     reasons for results:
antibiotic      concentration too high (50μL/mL      KAN + 25μL/mL      CAM)
MG1655ΔlacIcells      may no longer be competent
left MG1655ΔlacIcells      thawing in the ice for too long
electroporation      might have failed
plasmids      may not have been compatible
we      could try sequential transformation (still have to consider      antibiotic concentration of LB+KAN+CAM plate)
Next     Steps:

Equipment     used:
Autoclave
Bunsen      burner
Plate      reader
37°C      shaker in room 315
Protocol: Used interlab     protocol for     interlab calibration.
Second     attempt at Interlab     calibration #3: Fluorescence standard curve - Fluorescein Protocol
serial      dilution was performed and the plate was read
excitation      = 485nm
emission      = 525nm
optimal      gain used = 90
read      from bottom of plate
Reculturing     the overnight cultures from the interlab transformation
16      tubes with 5mL of LB and 5μLCAM
100μLfrom      each previous overnight culture placed in respective new tube (DH5α)
tubes      slightly unscrewed and tape placed on lid for aeration in shaker
tubes      placed in the shaker overnight at 37°C at 250rpm
Observations:
Second     double transformation pSB1C3+RFP     and pET28a+arg1in MG1655ΔlacI
LB+CAM+pSB1C3+RFP      and pET28a+arg1
sparsely       populated pink colonies
presence       of some colonies
LB+KAN+pSB1C3+RFP      and pET28a+arg1
no       visible colonies
LB+KAN+CAM+pSB1C3+RFP      and pET28a+arg1
no       visible colonies
LB+KAN+nontrasformed      cells (negative control)
no       visible colonies
LB+nontransformed      cells (positive control)
growth       on entire plate
Second     double transformation pSB1C3+RFP and pET28a+arg1 in MG1655ΔlacI
Potential     reasons for these results:
colonies      on LB+CAM+pSB1C3+RFP+pET28a+arg1)      because the cells are still competent and were transformed with pSB1C3+RPF
no      colonies on LB+KAN+pSB1C3+RFP      and pET28a+arg1not      because the cells are not competent, but rather the transformation      (pET28a+arg1into      MG1655ΔlacI) failed
no      colonies on LB+KAN+CAM+pSB1C3+RFP+pET28a+arg1 because      the backbones are not compatible
no      growth on LB+KAN+non      transformed cells (negative control) because there was no antibiotic      resistance gene in the cells
we      had growth on LB+non      transformed cells (positive control) because the cells were viable      and there was no selection in the plate against them
pET28a       = KAN resistant - incompatible with pSB1C3 by group check
pSB1C3       = CAM resistant - higher copy number than pET28a

Potential reasons for this result:
-PCR did not work
-the annealing temperature was wrong because it was calculated using the whole primer, instead of only the binding sequence
-the primers don't work
-the primers were suspended in water instead of TE buffer and could therefore be degraded
-nanodrop had inaccurate measurement for primer concentrations since they were old and small
-the primers were diluted to a concentration that would make them the limiting reagent for the reaction

Agenda:
     Growth curve for BL21 + Arg1 -> innoculation
 
Protocol:
     Growth Curve(BL-21 cells + arg1 plasmid)
     We started from innoculation.
     For first 2 hours, we took the OD measurement every 30 minutes.
     The plate reader was pre-set to 1) shake ( 1 mm amplitude, 7 sec) 2) measure ( 600mm wavelength, 5 flashes)
     After 2 hours, we took the OD measuremetn every 15 minutes.
     Since the measurements obtained were seemed to be random flucuation, the time interval for every measurement was switched back to 30mins (after ~5 hours)

Plan for future:
Redo growth curve and take OD measurements every 30 minutes.
 
Day 2, Wednesday 04/07
 
Individual Name: Daniel
People In Lab: Daniel, Tashi, Amalia, Jasmeen
 
Agenda:
     Inoculate BL21+arg1 and BL21 cells
     IPTG induction
     Make liquid LB medium
 
Protocol:
     Floatation Assay:
     Inoculate BL21 +arg1 cells and wait the OD reach 0.3 before 22hrs of IPTG induction
     Total of 6 tubes : 3 tubes ( BL21 + IPTG , BL21 + arg1, BL21 + arg1 + IPTG) * 2 treatments ( stand on tabletop and centrifuge under 350g for 4hrs)
     When OD600 = 0.47 we add 30uL of 3mM IPTG to the sample tube to make conc. reach 3uM in the medium.
 
 
Day 3, Thursday 05/07
People In Lab: Amalia, Daniel, NIna, Tashi, Jasmeen, Ahmed
 
Agenda:
     Floatation Assay
     Pick the overnight induction sample and measure the OD
     Inoculate new culture (BL21 +arg1 *2, BL21) and measure OD to reach 0.3
     IPTG induction for newly inoculated culture
     Growth curve with BL21+arg1 cells ( 30mins interval)
 
 
Protocol:
1. Floatation Assay:
Based on Shapiro Lab protocol
centrifuge the sample tubes under 350g for 4 hrs
3 sample tubes were set on the benchtop
Change plan for the floatation assay:
starting from 5 ml of overnight culture for 16hrs
1:100 dilution of the starting culture and let the OD reaches 0.5
Add IPTG to make conc. of 0.4mM(maybe 0.8mM for cell line we used) in the cell culture and start the induction for 22hrs under 30oC.
After induction, centrifuge under 350g for 4 hrs
2. Growth curve:
starting from inoculation
the cell was grown in shaker( 220RPM & 37oC)
Take the OD every 30 mins ( add 200ul to the plate reader)

Week 6
Day 1, Tuesday 03/07
People In Lab: Daniel, Tashi, Jasmeen
 
Agenda:
     Growth curve for BL21 + Arg1 -> innoculation
 
Protocol:
     Growth Curve(BL-21 cells + arg1 plasmid)
     We started from innoculation.
     For first 2 hours, we took the OD measurement every 30 minutes.
     The plate reader was pre-set to 1) shake ( 1 mm amplitude, 7 sec) 2) measure ( 600mm wavelength, 5 flashes)
     After 2 hours, we took the OD measuremetn every 15 minutes.
     Since the measurements obtained were seemed to be random flucuation, the time interval for every measurement was switched back to 30mins (after ~5 hours)

Agenda
Check Gibson and Bl21 competency plates
re-transform Gibson positive controls and gibson products
 
Results from Gibson
Both positive control plates (transformation control and gibson control) have colonies
None of the gibson product plates have colonies
 
 
image.png: Gibson plates: top left is positive control for transformation, top right is positive control for gibson, bottom 3 plates are plates with our gibson product transformation. Note the fact that only positive controls have colonies.
Troubleshooting
transformation was repeated
6 KAM plates were plated each with 200μl of transformed DH5a cells (50μl of DH5a cells transformed with 2μl of gibson product)
2 positive control plates: positive control for transformation (20μl of DH5a cells transformed with 2μl positive control plasmid)
positive control for gibson (20μl of DH5a cells transformed with 2μl of positive control gibson)
Results competency plates
plate plated with 50pg of plasmid grew 4 colonies
plate plated with 100pg of plasmid grew 3 colonies
plate plated with 10pg of plasmids did not grow colonies
