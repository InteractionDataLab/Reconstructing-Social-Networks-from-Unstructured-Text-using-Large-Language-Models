A summary of our project and what we have accomplished, the students behind all the amazing work and the people that helped us out along the way. Our project focuses on demonstrating flotation of Escherichia coli using gas vesicle proteins (GvPs) as a novel cellular separation technique for bioremediation processes. We propose that using this technique may be a cost-effective separation technique for various bioremediation processes. Upon sorption or uptake of pollutants or valuable materials, this technique could allow for simpler extraction of pollutant-harboring or heavy metal-bound bacteria. We have developed a bioreactor model to investigate this claim
