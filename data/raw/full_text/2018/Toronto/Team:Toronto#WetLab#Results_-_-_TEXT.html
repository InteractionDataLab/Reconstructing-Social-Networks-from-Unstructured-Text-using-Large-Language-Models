Overview
Our project design      was to create a new approach to bioremediation platform using      flotation to help remove or acquire particles of interest from liquid      media that could be applied across industries that produce      waste-water. Past iGEM teams have attempted to implement cellular      flotation as a remediation platform but have demonstrated      inconsistent and inconclusive cell flotation results. Thus, the goal      of our wet lab team was to develop an optimized protocol that would      be used to induce flotation in Escherichia coli via the      expression of gas vesicles, which could be implemented into a      bioreactor model designed by our dry lab team. We were able to      acquire a genetically engineered gas vesicle operon arg1 from      the Shapiro Lab. This construct consists of primary gas vesicle      proteins GvPA and GvPC from Aphanizomenon      flos-aquae, and secondary GvP R/N/F/G/L/S/K/J/T/U      from Bacillus megaterium, which when combined into one      construct, improved gas vesicle size and echogenic property resulting      in better ultrasound imaging and confer flotation to E. coli cells (1). Since the primary goal of the Shapiro Lab was not to use      the gas vesicles for flotation, their assays were not optimized for      this function. Therefore, we adapted their protocol for flotation and      removed illegal cut sites from the operon. We also used this adapted      protocol on a new construct that we created, consisting of GvPs A and      C without the secondary proteins to observe differences in flotation.
Experiment
The arg1 construct (BBa_K2699000) in a pET28a expression vector with a T7      promoter inducible by Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)      was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain. After growing      the cells from a diluted overnight culture to an OD of ~0.5, they      were induced with 1.6mM IPTG. After 22 hours of induction, cells were      expected to exhibit buoyancy while non-induced cells were not.      Buoyancy was tested by placing induced and uninduced cell cultures in      falcon tubes, which were left on the benchtop and pictures were taken      over the course of 5+ hours to see shifts in cell density.
Results
(BBa_K2699000) arg1 construct:
After 5 hours on      the benchtop post induction (1.6mM IPTG), E. Coli BL21 (DE3)      cells transformed with arg1 showed a higher density of cells      along the height of the tube vs non-induced and non-transformed      cells. they also show a smaller amount of cells precipitated at the      bottom of the tube, meaning fewer cells sunk down (Fig 1). This      indicates that cells expressing arg1 are more buoyant than      non-expressing cells, however, they are not buoyant enough to migrate      to the top the culture. To test the replicability of these results      the same culture was vortexed a week later and left on the bench top      (Fig 2) and the same pattern in culture density change was observed      indicating that the gas vesicles produced by arg1 are      relatively stable and cells can retain the gained phenotype for up to      a week (longer time periods not tested). Even after more than 24      hours on the bench expressing cells didn’t all precipitate at the      bottom (Fig 2D). It was not tested if cells lose some of their      buoyancy over time or what the percentage loss is.
Culture density      starts uniformly across all constructs and we find that the arg1 retains cellular density in the suspended state whereas negative      control has cellular density pelleted to the bottom of the tube (Fig      1). Any difference in culture buoyant forces will cause variation in      how culture density changes over time. This method for testing      buoyancy lacks a quantitative aspect, however, it is the easiest to      replicate with the least interference. We found that our pET28a      construct containing arg1 performed floatation in LB media      over a 25 hour period after induction by IPTG, unlike the negative      control.

To track changes in      culture density overtime, pictures of the cultures were taken every      hour for 6 hours (Fig 3). Two different concentrations of IPTG      (1.6mM, 1.8mM) were used to test if more IPTG would enhance buoyancy.      There was no observable difference between induced cells and negative      controls until after 2 hours on the benchtop (fig 3c). The culture      density along the height of the tube looks the same, however there      are fewer cells at the bottom of the induced tubes compared to the      control tubes. After 5 hours (fig 3d), more cells settled to the      bottom with the induced tubes still having fewer cells than the      controls however a difference in culture density along the height of      the tube is observed with the induced tube having a denser culture      than the control. After 6 hours (fig 3e), as more cells settle to the      bottom, the cultures became clearer and the tube induced with 1.6mM      seemed to have the densest culture at the top of the tube.

We wanted to      determine whether having the primary structural proteins alone was      sufficient to make E. Coli buoyant so we cloned GvpA and GvpC      in the pKDL071 vector, however the T7 promoter was mutated after      cloning. Since the previous concentration of 2mM did not induce      flotation, we reverted to using 1.6mM. With 1.6mM, all cultures      looked the same after 1 hour consistent with results shown in Fig. 3.      The surface of the negative controls is clear and a clear line at the      interface where the culture density changes after leaving the tubes      for 3 hours on the bench (fig 4c) this clearance line is seen at the      top of the induced tube. At 4 hours (fig 4d) this line goes lower in      all tubes but is still higher in the induced tube showing that      induced tubes are again more buoyant than controls.

A plasmid      expressing RFP (pBbA7c_RPF) under the same induction control as arg1 was co-transformed in BL21 (DE3) to visualize the cells more easily      and track their changes in height over time. We repeated the assay      (Fig 5) using 2mM IPTG for induction, as this concentration showed      better RFP expression. All cultures for both induced and uninduced      cells showed no observable difference in cell density. This could be due to a smaller volume (15 ml) used for this test compared to      previous tests (25 ml).

The following flotation assay [fig. 8      (a-i)] was captured over the span of 25 hours, and is summarized in      figure 7. A flotation phenotype was observed in BL21 cells      co-transformed with arg1_pET28 and pBbA7C_ RFP. This culture      retained the buoyancy phenotype 25 hours after being placed on the      benchtop (1.6mM IPTG) (fig 8 h,i), which shows the robustness of our      phenotype. The induced BL21 arg1 + RFP culture showed      a higher density along the height of the tube, as well as a smaller      mass of cells sinking to the bottom compared to the uninduced BL21 arg1 + RFP (fig.8 a-i). To quantify this observation we      decided to create an OD profile of the induced and uninduced BL21      pET28a_arg1 + pBbA7c_RFP cultures by removing and      reading sequential aliquots off the top layer of the tube. The last      mL of each sample contained the semi-solid settled cell mass at the      bottom of each tube. To compare the number of cells that had      completely sunk to the bottom of the tube we pelleted the last mL,      discarded the supernatant, and measured the cell mass. The induced      cell pellet mass was half of the uninduced cell pellet mass (fig 7). We used a two-sample t-test to check whether the mean of the induced and none induced cultures significantly differed. The null hypothesis was that there is no difference between the two samples, while the alternative hypothesis was that there is a difference. With a p-value of p = 0.000027, n =28 and alpha = 0.01, we were able to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis      This show that the induced cells were significantly more buoyant than the      uninduced cells as they remained at a higher levels in the media for      a longer period of time.

Discussion
Overall we obtained      inconsistent results. A few flotation assays show a clear difference      between induced and non-induced BL21 arg1. We have reason to      believe that this is due to inefficient arg1 expression.      Firstly, the reporter gene amilCP that we introduced to arg1 was not expressed. Secondly, the SDS-PAGE gel showed no indication of      a difference between induced and uninduced arg1. To confirm      that this was due to the inability of arg1 to be expressed, we      also induced the RFP gene in the pBbA7c expression vector under the      same induction control as the arg1 operon. In the SDS-PAGE gel      (fig 6), there was an obvious difference between RFP protein levels      in induced and uninduced cells, indicating effective expression of      the protein after induction.
Inefficient      expression of arg1 could be due to E. Coli strain      differences between our strain BL21 (DE3) and the strain used in the      Shapiro Lab paper (BL21-AI) (1). Although, this shouldn’t have an      effect on arg1 expression since the main difference between      the strains is that the T7 polymerase is inducible by L-arabinose in      BL21-AI and IPTG in BL21 (DE3). The expression of RFP in the      BL21(DE3) cell line suggests that using this strain should not have      been a problem since there was enough T7 polymerase to express the      protein.
After excluding the      secondary proteins, we did not observe a difference in flotation. Our      pKDL071_A+C construct acquired mutations in the promoter region,      which could explain why flotation was not induced. As a result of      this, we cannot be sure of whether this new construct would be      better, worse, or similar in efficacy of forming the gas vesicles      essential for flotation.
In the cases where      we did observe a difference in flotation, the cells shift from a      homogenous mixture to settling more slowly than the negative      controls. This is contrary to our expectation of having a distinct      cell layer on the surface, which suggests the gas vesicles do not      confer enough buoyancy to the cell with an upward force strong enough      to allow them to significantly increase their height in the culture,      but rather a force only strong enough to prevent them from sinking as      quickly as cells without the induced operon.
Further experiments      will be carried out to test the effects of secondary protein      permutation on flotation. There will also be an investigation into      the reason behind the inefficient induction of the operon.
