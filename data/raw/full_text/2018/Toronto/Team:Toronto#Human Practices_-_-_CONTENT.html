          Our project focused on the bioremediation of wastewater which is an issue present 
          in the industrial sector and throughout the environment. Clean freshwater is a 
          finite resource and bioremediation of contaminated water bodies is becoming 
          increasingly important. Emerging innovative technologies for effective and low 
          energy treatment of wastewater exists. It was important for us to discover what 
          impact our project could have among existing wastewater treatment technologies. 
          We also believed it was important to obtain insight from relevant stakeholders 
          which would help our project evolve into a valuable and useful method. In other 
          words, we felt integrated Human Practices was paramount in the construction of our 
          project. 
          
          Our starting point was a paper which we discovered in Nature titled: Acoustic 
          Reporter Genes for Noninvasive Imaging of Microorganisms in Mammalian Hosts, 
          published by the lab of Mikhail Shapiro, at Caltech. This paper used an established 
          biological process -- the formation of simple gas-filled vesicles in known bacteria 
          and archaea -- in an innovative way: as an imaging platform, using specific 
          resonances to selectively collapse the vesicles and mapping their locations in 
          mammalian deep tissue.
          
          Through this paper, our Wet Lab team knew that viable parameters for manipulating 
          the gas vesicle size, shape, and location did exist. These parameters exist in the 
          form of the different genes that produce the gas vesicles; from here, we would use 
          these parameters and combine them with the unique aspects of our project -- 
          coupling the expression of gas vesicles with the bacteria in question binding to 
          our molecule of interest. Now, theoretically, we could use the bacteria to separate 
          our molecule of interest from water and then make the bacteria float using vesicles. 
          By creating a physically separate layer where the bacteria had taken up the 
          contaminant in question, this makes the water treatment process dramatically 
          easier, and produces a viable bioremediation platform!
          
          We contacted the Shapiro lab and they agreed to send us key bacterial strains needed 
          to produce our vesicular construct. Correspondence with the Shapiro lab and previous 
          relevant iGEM teams taught us how to optimize the parameters for gas vesicle 
          production to meet our needs. Concurrent with this process was research and the 
          writing of a comprehensive literature review. This research provided us with the 
          knowledge about the genetic system responsible for gas vesicle production and that 
          there are a few critical genes which we can be manipulated and used in the 
          optimization of gas vesicle production, GvpA and GvpC. Conveying this knowledge 
          to our Wet Lab Team, they were able to use these leads to optimize gas vesicle 
          expression and create a model bioremediation system in the lab.
          
          By developing a biomass separation platform using cells with enhanced biosorptive 
          abilities, we can capture high-value materials or pollutants from wastewater effluent 
          which could be a viable alternative dewatering process to complement or replace 
          traditional centrifugation and filtration processes. Our aspiration was to develop 
          such a platform that can be used in industry, to benefit the environment, and have 
          real-world application. Using scientific discoveries from various articles and 
          feedback from departmental graduate students 
          <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Biozone_Interviews">[CLICK HERE FOR MORE DETAILS]</A>, 
          wet lab decided to use microbial gas vesicles in the bioremediation of wastewater. 
          Meeting with stakeholders and experts allowed us to establish our project’s 
          applicability within the industry and the potential it had to eliminate energy 
          inefficiencies, harsh chemical uses, expensive processes, obtainment of high-value 
          materials and pollutant removal. Secondly, these meetings ensured our project was 
          developed to be used responsibly. Based on the feedback received from stakeholders, 
          public opinion, and policymakers, we had our Human Practices team focus on the 
          applicability of our project by determining design constraints to guide our wet 
          lab and dry lab work. We believe by focusing on addressing key issues, the rational 
          development of a useful “GMO” technology could outweigh the often irrational fear of 
          GMOs. 
          
          Two specific stakeholder interactions influenced our project. From this, we 
          learned that our project had some potential to achieve remove pollutants such as 
          microplastics and pharmaceuticals, or extracting heavy metals and other high-value 
          materials, ultimately resulting in clean, usable water. </P></DIV><DIV class="page-section" id="3"><H1>KINROSS - Extraction of Valuables &amp; Removal of Pollutants</H1><P>

          Ashbridges Bay and North Toronto Treatment Plants expressed their concerns for microplastics and pharmaceuticals. Safe and effective treatment of wastewater is important for sustaining the health and well-being of Toronto citizens and the environment. Current and future wastewater treatment is put under regulations imposed by the provincial and federal government to ensure the environment and public health is preserved. Our work aims to promote these standards and eliminate harms that threaten public health and the environment.

          Our interaction with the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs 
          (OMAFRA) informed us that 95% of Ontario’s food processors are linked to municipal 
          sewage systems. This presented a direct link to our design’s applicability for 
          Toronto’s wastewater treatment plants. Furthermore, the OMAFRA has two major issues 
          within the food sector. The management of phosphorus due to sanitation cycles and 
          the capture and removal of biological oxygen demand (BOD), fats, oils and greases 
          (FOG) and suspended solids (SS). Our project would respectively focus on the removal 
          of BOD and SS. To authenticate these applications, we met with Ping Wu, the past 
          president at Professional Engineers Government of Ontario (PEGO). We discovered the 
          OMAFRA had problems with BOD. As water efficiency improves in homes, due to low 
          flush toilets, the residential BOD increases. Increased BOD results in more hydraulic 
          capacity use in wastewater treatment plants. 
          
          In Germany and the Netherlands in the mid-90’s regulatory response to increasing 
          residential loadings was to cut manufacturing off of sewer services. In some 
          communities, it meant that the entire cost of wastewater treatment was then borne 
          by residential users. In Ontario, this has happened when large food processors in 
          small communities lose their food processors – such as the closure of Nabisco in 
          Exeter and Libby’s in Wallaceburg.</P></DIV><DIV class="page-section" id="6"><H1>Conclusion</H1><P>
          We created opportunities for feedback from the public to integrate and influence 
          the direction of our design. These included the SynBio Forum, our SynTalks podcast, 
          and our public survey. The SynBio Forum 
          <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Public_Engagement">[CLICK HERE FOR MORE DETAILS]</A>
          engaged the 
          minds of the public on the topic of synthetic biology and its environmental, legal, 
          social and ethical implications. Audience members were asked to complete a short 
          survey which illustrated their preconceived notions of synthetic biology and their 
          opinion on our project. After the panel, audience members were asked to conduct a 
          post-panel survey to measure the efficacy of the information conveyed during the 
          panel. 
          
          Our SynTalks podcast 
          <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Toronto/PolicyAndPractices/Outreach">[CLICK HERE FOR MORE DETAILS]</A>
          presented the opportunity for 
          us to gain insight from professionals from various fields associated with synthetic 
          biology and our project. We interviewed policy experts from the Department of 
          Environment and Climate Change Canada on the legal and ethical issues that revolve 
          around our project and synthetic biology. Furthermore, we produced episodes which 
          interviewed experts from the medical, agricultural, and environmental field which 
          aimed to disclose the facts and educated opinions of synthetic biology and 
          genetically engineered microorganisms. As a result of these interviews, we 
          integrated the knowledge acquired from these experts and policymakers to establish 
          how our design would be effective, safe, ethical, and beneficial. 
          
          We integrated all these aspects (interviews, meetings, outreach programs, and 
          public engagements programs) to the design of our project. By building a 
          relationship with Kinross Gold Corporation and the Wastewater Treatment Plants of 
          Toronto, we were able to determine what materials or pollutants were a complication 
          for the bioremediation of wastewater where heavy metals present in mining 
          operations and microplastics, penicillin and other pharmaceuticals. This data was 
          relayed to the wet and dry lab teams and was used to develop our project. Our 
          dry lab team used this collected information to investigate the application of 
          cellular floatation in a bioreactor-type bioremediation process. Furthermore, dry 
          lab aimed to estimate maximum mechanical carrying capacity of an engineered biomass 
          of a particular mass which is significant for the bioreactor model. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
