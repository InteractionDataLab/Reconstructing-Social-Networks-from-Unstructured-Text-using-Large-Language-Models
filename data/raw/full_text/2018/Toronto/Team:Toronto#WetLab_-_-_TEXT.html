The wet lab team sought to establish an optimised protocol that would confer floatation to Escherichia coli when transformed with plasmid containing a gas vesicle proteins operon. This plasmid is a synthetic hybrid of gas vesicle proteins from wild Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Bacillus megaterium. We were able to use empirical data from growth curves of our experimental cell lines and use it as a parameter to model our floating cells in the context of a bioreactor computer model.
