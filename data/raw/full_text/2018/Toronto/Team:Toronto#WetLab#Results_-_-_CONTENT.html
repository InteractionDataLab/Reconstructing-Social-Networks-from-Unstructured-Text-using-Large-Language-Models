					was to create a new approach to bioremediation platform using
					flotation to help remove or acquire particles of interest from liquid
					media that could be applied across industries that produce
					waste-water. Past iGEM teams have attempted to implement cellular
					flotation as a remediation platform but have demonstrated
					inconsistent and inconclusive cell flotation results. Thus, the goal
					of our wet lab team was to develop an optimized protocol that would
					be used to induce flotation in <I>Escherichia coli</I> via the
					expression of gas vesicles, which could be implemented into a
					bioreactor model designed by our dry lab team. We were able to
					acquire a genetically engineered gas vesicle operon <I>arg1</I> from
					the Shapiro Lab. This construct consists of primary gas vesicle
					proteins GvPA and GvPC from <FONT size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><I><SPAN style="background: #ffffff">Aphanizomenon
					flos-aquae,</SPAN></I></FONT> and secondary GvP R/N/F/G/L/S/K/J/T/U
					from <I>Bacillus megaterium</I>, which when combined into one
					construct, improved gas vesicle size and echogenic property resulting
					in better ultrasound imaging and confer flotation to <I>E. coli</I>
					cells (1). Since the primary goal of the Shapiro Lab was not to use
					the gas vesicles for flotation, their assays were not optimized for
					this function. Therefore, we adapted their protocol for flotation and
					removed illegal cut sites from the operon. We also used this adapted
					protocol on a new construct that we created, consisting of GvPs A and
					C without the secondary proteins to observe differences in flotation.</P><P style="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Experiment </B></P><P style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">The <I>arg1
					</I>construct (BBa_K2699000) in a pET28a expression vector with a T7
					promoter inducible by Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)
					was transformed into <I>E. coli</I> BL21 (DE3) strain. After growing
					the cells from a diluted overnight culture to an OD of ~0.5, they
					were induced with 1.6mM IPTG. After 22 hours of induction, cells were
					expected to exhibit buoyancy while non-induced cells were not.
					Buoyancy was tested by placing induced and uninduced cell cultures in
					falcon tubes, which were left on the benchtop and pictures were taken
					over the course of 5+ hours to see shifts in cell density.</P><P style="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Results </B></P><P style="margin-bottom: 0in">(BBa_K2699000) <I>arg1</I> construct:</P><P style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">After 5 hours on
					the benchtop post induction (1.6mM IPTG), <I>E. Coli</I> BL21 (DE3)
					cells transformed with <I>arg1</I> showed a higher density of cells
					along the height of the tube vs non-induced and non-transformed
					cells. they also show a smaller amount of cells precipitated at the
					bottom of the tube, meaning fewer cells sunk down (Fig 1). This
					indicates that cells expressing <I>arg1</I> are more buoyant than
					non-expressing cells, however, they are not buoyant enough to migrate
					to the top the culture. To test the replicability of these results
					the same culture was vortexed a week later and left on the bench top
					(Fig 2) and the same pattern in culture density change was observed
					indicating that the gas vesicles produced by <I>arg1</I> are
					relatively stable and cells can retain the gained phenotype for up to
					a week (longer time periods not tested). Even after more than 24
					hours on the bench expressing cells didn’t all precipitate at the
					bottom (Fig 2D). It was not tested if cells lose some of their
					buoyancy over time or what the percentage loss is.</P><P style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Culture density
					starts uniformly across all constructs and we find that the <I>arg1</I>
					retains cellular density in the suspended state whereas negative
					control has cellular density pelleted to the bottom of the tube (Fig
					1). Any difference in culture buoyant forces will cause variation in
					how culture density changes over time. This method for testing
					buoyancy lacks a quantitative aspect, however, it is the easiest to
					replicate with the least interference. We found that our pET28a
					construct containing <I>arg1</I> performed floatation in LB media
					over a 25 hour period after induction by IPTG, unlike the negative
					control.</P><P style="margin-bottom: 0in">Fig 1. Cultures of non-transformed

					culture density overtime, pictures of the cultures were taken every
					hour for 6 hours (Fig 3). Two different concentrations of IPTG
					(1.6mM, 1.8mM) were used to test if more IPTG would enhance buoyancy.
					There was no observable difference between induced cells and negative
					controls until after 2 hours on the benchtop (fig 3c). The culture
					density along the height of the tube looks the same, however there
					are fewer cells at the bottom of the induced tubes compared to the
					control tubes. After 5 hours (fig 3d), more cells settled to the
					bottom with the induced tubes still having fewer cells than the
					controls however a difference in culture density along the height of
					the tube is observed with the induced tube having a denser culture
					than the control. After 6 hours (fig 3e), as more cells settle to the
					bottom, the cultures became clearer and the tube induced with 1.6mM
					seemed to have the densest culture at the top of the tube.

					cloning. Since the previous concentration of 2mM did not induce
					flotation, we reverted to using 1.6mM. With 1.6mM, all cultures
					looked the same after 1 hour consistent with results shown in Fig. 3.
					The surface of the negative controls is clear and a clear line at the
					interface where the culture density changes after leaving the tubes
					for 3 hours on the bench (fig 4c) this clearance line is seen at the
					top of the induced tube. At 4 hours (fig 4d) this line goes lower in
					all tubes but is still higher in the induced tube showing that

					non-induced <I>arg1</I>The following flotation assay [fig. 8
					(a-i)] was captured over the span of 25 hours, and is summarized in
					figure 7. A flotation phenotype was observed in BL21 cells
					co-transformed with <I>arg1_</I>pET28 and pBbA7C_ RFP. This culture
					retained the buoyancy phenotype 25 hours after being placed on the
					benchtop (1.6mM IPTG) (fig 8 h,i), which shows the robustness of our
					phenotype. The induced BL21 <I>arg1 </I>+ <I>RFP</I>  culture showed
					a higher density along the height of the tube, as well as a smaller
					mass of cells sinking to the bottom compared to the uninduced BL21
					<I>arg1 </I>+ <I>RFP </I>(fig.8 a-i). To quantify this observation we
					decided to create an OD profile of the induced and uninduced BL21
					pET28a_<I>arg1 + </I>pBbA7c_<I>RFP</I> cultures by removing and
					reading sequential aliquots off the top layer of the tube. The last
					mL of each sample contained the semi-solid settled cell mass at the
					bottom of each tube. To compare the number of cells that had
					completely sunk to the bottom of the tube we pelleted the last mL,
					discarded the supernatant, and measured the cell mass. The induced
					cell pellet mass was half of the uninduced cell pellet mass (fig 7). We used a two-sample t-test to check whether the mean of the induced and none induced cultures significantly differed. The null hypothesis was that there is no difference between the two samples, while the alternative hypothesis was that there is a difference. With a p-value of p = 0.000027, n =28 and alpha = 0.01, we were able to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis
					This show that the induced cells were significantly more buoyant than the
					uninduced cells as they remained at a higher levels in the media for
					a longer period of time.</P><P style="margin-bottom: 0in">Oct 15th

					inconsistent results. A few flotation assays show a clear difference
					between induced and non-induced BL21 <I>arg1</I>. We have reason to
					believe that this is due to inefficient <I>arg1 </I>expression.
					Firstly, the reporter gene amilCP that we introduced to <I>arg1</I>
					was not expressed. Secondly, the SDS-PAGE gel showed no indication of
					a difference between induced and uninduced <I>arg1</I>. To confirm
					that this was due to the inability of <I>arg1 </I>to be expressed, we
					also induced the RFP gene in the pBbA7c expression vector under the
					same induction control as the <I>arg1 </I>operon. In the SDS-PAGE gel
					(fig 6), there was an obvious difference between RFP protein levels
					in induced and uninduced cells, indicating effective expression of
					the protein after induction.</P><P style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Inefficient
					expression of <I>arg1</I> could be due to <I>E. Coli</I> strain
					differences between our strain BL21 (DE3) and the strain used in the
					Shapiro Lab paper (BL21-AI) (1). Although, this shouldn’t have an
					effect on <I>arg1 </I>expression since the main difference between
					the strains is that the T7 polymerase is inducible by L-arabinose in
					BL21-AI and IPTG in BL21 (DE3). The expression of RFP in the
					BL21(DE3) cell line suggests that using this strain should not have
					been a problem since there was enough T7 polymerase to express the
					protein.</P><P style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">After excluding the
					secondary proteins, we did not observe a difference in flotation. Our
					pKDL071_A+C construct acquired mutations in the promoter region,
					which could explain why flotation was not induced. As a result of
					this, we cannot be sure of whether this new construct would be
					better, worse, or similar in efficacy of forming the gas vesicles
					essential for flotation.</P><P style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">In the cases where
					we did observe a difference in flotation, the cells shift from a
					homogenous mixture to settling more slowly than the negative
					controls. This is contrary to our expectation of having a distinct
					cell layer on the surface, which suggests the gas vesicles do not
					confer enough buoyancy to the cell with an upward force strong enough
					to allow them to significantly increase their height in the culture,
					but rather a force only strong enough to prevent them from sinking as
					quickly as cells without the induced operon. 
					</P><P style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Further experiments
					will be carried out to test the effects of secondary protein
					permutation on flotation. There will also be an investigation into
					the reason behind the inefficient induction of the operon.</P><P style="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>References</B></P><OL><LI><P style="margin-bottom: 0in"> Bourdeau, R. <I>et al</I>.
