By persistently interviewing local companies, government regulators, municipal services, and academics, we sculpted the mechanisms of our platform to fit the need of our community. In conjunction, we employed public awareness campaigns, to wear away any anti-GMO stigma that may hinder both our project and the synthetic biology community as a whole. Through workshops, panel discussions, literature reviews, and the creation of a unique, synthetic-biology-focused podcast, Syntalks, we have integrated our team’s fundamental science and prepared it for a tangible impact.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV style="background-color: rgba(0,0,0,1.0);"><DIV class="center" style="height: 550px; width: 80%;"><DIV class="centerPacker"><DIV class="grid-container"><DIV class="item1"><H1 class="textArial" style="text-align: center;"><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Human_Practices">

Our team interviewed a total of 26 graduate students from Biozone, a center within our host Chemical Engineering Department, which finds new innovative ways to apply biotechnology to address urgent societal needs in environment, energy and health. Most projects revolved around the cleaning or bioremediation of water in some specific respect. Our interviewees were working on various projects from using proteins for enhancing bio-sludge dewaterability to applying biofilms in the recovery of rare earth metals. After conducting these interviews, we were able to establish the relevance of our project.

					but also showed us that wastewater treatment was quite a mechanical and chemical heavy process that had not involved much advancement.

An important aspect of iGEM and synthetic biology is addressing the public’s fear of GMOs and eliminating lack of knowledge on the subject, which incentivized us to make a podcast series, SynTalks. SynTalks intents to educate the general public on the prolifera of work done with the help of synthetic biology in the fields of medicine, agricultural, environment and energy. We wanted to emphasize that synthetic biology is not just restricted to “Frankenstein” GMO foods in your grocery stores. The first 3 episodes on synthetic biology in the world of medicine was released in mid-July. We interviewed Dr. Kathleen Hefferon and Dr. Jennifer Mitchel, who are professors at the University of Toronto, as well as Noeline Subramaniam, who is a Ph.D. Student. We then released episode 4 and 5 which focused on the role of synthetic biology on the environment and agricultural field. We interviewed Dr. Stockkad a professor at U of T, and Patrick, who is a Masters student. Episode 6 interviewed Jim Louter who is the Manager of the Biotechnology Section and Emerging Priorities Division in the Science and Technology Branch at Environment and Climate Change Canada and Valar Anoop Ph.D. who is a Senior Biologist in Biotechnology at Health Canada. This episode focused on the ethics and policy surrounding synthetic biology.
