Literature Review
Intoduction
Our literature review focuses on the application of our project and comparing current wastewater treatment procedures. By addressing the inefficiencies in current industrial methods, we hope to outline the impact our project will have on the water treatment process, aiming to eliminate energy inefficiencies, harsh chemical use, expensive processes, and improve pollutant or high-value material removal. Furthermore, we demonstrate the components of our gas vesicle coupled bioremediation platform.
Section 1: Current Industrial Methods
Industry uses chemical, mechanical, and biological methods to separate cells to obtain high-value materials or remove pollutants from water or other aqueous substances.
Subsections:
- Biofuel and Biomass Separation From Algae
- Water waste Treatment
- Mining
- Biological
Section 2:
An illustration of our platform and how its theoretically supposed to be couple with the expression of gas vesicles to get our compounds of interest,which is also built to integrate with wet-lab to help them with the optimization with the Arg1 operon and conduct research on the secondary proteins responsible for gas vesicle formation.
- Intro:
- Subsections:
- Background
- Gene/Proteins and Properties of Gas Vesicle Formation
- Experiments
- Theoretical Application with Existing Cell Separation Technologies
Section 3:
There is where the data from our two industries (Kinross and Toronto Municipal water services come into play). Here we plan to illustrate through the help of dry labs calculations on how efficient our platform with the current industries we talked about in the first section.
- Subsections:
- Inefficiencies in current industries
- What parts of the industry we can apply ourselves?
- Heavy Metal Extraction
- Antibiotic Extraction
