Parts Overview
As mentioned in the project description and result, our three different circuits in three different kinds of bacteria well supported our project and each of them contributes a lot to the biobricks. This year, we designed, constructed and verified 25 parts, and 21 of them were submitted. There are composite parts producing enzyme to transform different carbon source to lactate and transform out of the bacteria. We completely collected the parts from our project and well documented them with our test data.
