Modeling overview
1. Overview
This year, our job can be mainly divided into three parts: Comparison of Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Synechocystis, sort of three genes pathway in Rhodopseudomonas palustris, and intelligent device software.
2. Model of systems
In the past, people use Synechocystis to provide energy for electricity producing bacteria. Because it’s efficient and easier to control. But Shewanella species are heterotrophic facultative anaerobes, and produce electricity only in anaerobic environment (Justin et al.2009). So we think Rhodopseudomonas palustris may be better because its cycle photophosphorylation doesn’t produce oxygen. But Rhodopseudomonas palustris is not as efficient as Synechocystis. So we use computer simulation to find which is better.
3. Sort of three genes
In Rhodopseudomonas palustris, the sequence of genes in plasmid influences their expression ability. (Shou-Chen.2012) We have three genes to transfer. So we should find out which gene is  the most important, and we sort three genes by their importance.
4. Intelligent device software
Using a new multi-culture bacteria system means we should use a new experiment strategy. So we build a software to capture the situation of our system and learn to decide what to do to interact our system in order to get a better electricity output.  .
