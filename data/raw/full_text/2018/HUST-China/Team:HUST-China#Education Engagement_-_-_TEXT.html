1. Survey About Whether People Know About Bio-power Generation
In order to know viewpoints on bio-power generation and its future development from the public, and show the practical significance and future promotion of our project, we conducted a questionnaire survey for both non-biological professionals and bio-specialists to make the data more reliable. Based on the results we get, people who do not major in biology don’t pay much attention on bio-power generation. But when we told them about the mechanisms and benefits of microbial power generation, they were also curious about them. Under the energy crisis nowadays, most of them believe that researchers should focus more on the research and development of bio-power generation. However, when we asked if they were willing to accept and purchase bio-power generation products, they still showed doubts on them. Most of them considered more about price and practicality. For the bio-professionals working in this domain, they believe that bio-power generation is a new energy developing trend, and there will be great potential for it to become the main energy sourse in the future. There are still several difficulties need to be solved. The results of the questionnaire also tell us that we can let more people understand bio-power generation by education, and this can help us promote the project in the future. In a word, our project follows the energy requirements and can be greatly used. But it still need much time to optimize it. Therefore, for people know not much about synthetic biology, we also try to provide them with relevant information. We wrote a tweet about synthetic biology and bio-batteries and broadcasted it on the official WeChat public account so that more people can know how synthetic biology is changing our daily life.
2. Using Simple Experiment To Make Young Students Interested In Our Project
To let more people know about bio-power generation and biosynthesis. Our team hosted the summer camp for high school students. During the camp, we gave them a speech to help them understand what is synthetic biology and what is iGEM. We adopt a shallow and deep educational guidance method, and try to export the complicated mechanism to students in an easy-to-understand way. As an introduction, we designed an experiment to allow the high school students do by themselves in the lab and feel the enchantment of biological experiments. The power generation function of the lemon battery gave them a chance to know about our project this year - "Light-electricity energy convertion" (microbial power generation). The core member of our project, Shewanella, is a new thing to them. Through the introduction of our team members, they know about what can shewanella do in nature and how it can be made full use of in bio-power generation. At the same time, the event also gave high school students more understanding of the iGEM spirit, which will help raise the popularity of iGEM and gain more creative design from them.
