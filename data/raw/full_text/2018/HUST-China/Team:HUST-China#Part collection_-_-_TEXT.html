This part collection well documents ten circuits in Shewanella oneidensis of our project with every detailed characterization of the transcriptional related proteins and promoters. The collection contains two primary circuits, where tac promoter and enhanced RBS are applied.
Circuit one:
This circuit aims at improving the efficiency of lactate generation. It contains two genes encoding D-lactate dehydrogenase and L-lactate dehydrogenase.
Circuit two:
The secondary circuit is try to improve the production of NADH as which includes four genes responsible for certain reaction in the metabolism system.
To better verify and quantify the functions of the circuits, the secondary circuits and single sectors of them are included, and as a result, not only can this part collection be applied to realize an optimized generation of electricity in Shewanella oneidensis, but also it offers comprehensive options for users to achieve certain functions with different compositions of these circuits.
