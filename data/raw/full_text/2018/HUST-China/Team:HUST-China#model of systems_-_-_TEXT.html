Model of systems
Part1: Abstract
Modelling is a powerful tool in synthetic biology that allows us to get a deeper understanding of our system. In order to see whether our system can work and how our system will work, we build this model to simulate our system. This model shows us the details of our system and give our intelligent device software data so that we can change the environment to increase the efficiency and stability of Optopia.

The O2 consuming is calculated by

This function shows the inhibit of CO2 to the metabolism of Synechocystis. The lack of carbon source will not only effect the growth rate of the bacteria, but also reduce the produce rate of lactate.

2.Rhodopseudomonas palustris
These are the main differential equations about the modeling  part of the Rhodopseudomonas palustris (abbreviated as “Rps”). Through these differential equations, we can calculate the concentrations of Rps, carbon dioxide and lactate. The parameters and variables above will be introduced below.This part is similar to that of Synechocystis, because in our experiment, they are both used to provide lactate to Shewanella and have similar genetic modification.

3. Shewanella
In generate, the three elements urgently needed to be modeled in Shewanella are the changes in biomass (Dry Weight, g/L), electricity production (mV), and lactate content (g/L) over time. Once the Shewanella modeling is completed, we only need to combine the model of Shewanella with the model of Synechocystis or Rhodopseudomonas palustris to determine which one is better to facilitate electricity produce. The process of deduction will write blow:
First, we need to simulate biomass function. Our biomass function is based on monod equation:
In this function, μ is specific growth rate of biomass.
Because there are two important growth factors in our model: lactate and oxygen content, we need some modifying tasks in this model. Noticing that the concentration of oxygen and lactate are both promoting biomass growth, with the inspiration of monod equation, we take the two factors into consideration so the function changes to:
In this function, cLac is concentration of lactate.
After this, we realized that a factor about oxygen competition is needed to add in the function. So we import a parameter to solve this problem, the function is modified to:
Taking the efficiency ratio of aerobic and anaerobic respiration (19:1) into consideration, we calculated two parameters:
The two parameters are used in our electricity production simulation:
The basic function is the famous Nernst equation:
In this function Ox is oxidized type, and Red is reduced type.
The Nernst equation is very clear and easy to use, but we have to add a Shewanella biomass factor to show the macroscopic electricity production. The lactic consuming value is closely related to the concentration of Shewanella. In addition, after the metabolic analysis of lactic in Shewanella, we promoted the function by modifying (or simplifying) the
section. As a result, the electricity production function is:
In this function,
The last work in Shewanella modeling is the lactic consuming simulation:
The concentration of lactate dominates largely on electricity production. Similarly, with the inspiration of Monod equation, we notice that the concentration of lactate acid and Shewanella itself is in a positive correlation to lactic consuming rate. So we have summarized the lactic consuming equation:

Part3: Result
The voltage output of the three systems (Rhodopseudomonas palustris- Shewanella, Synechocystis - Shewanella and Shewanella only) are shown in the following figure:
The figure shows that because Rhodopseudomonas palustris  and Synechocystis can produce lactate, these two systems can produce electricity more efficiently and steadily, which demonstrates the value and feasibility of our project. In the beginning of the Synechocystis-Shewanella system, oxygen produced by Synechocystis inhibited the electricity production of Shewanella, so this system doesn’t have peak value.
After molecular engineering, we get experiment data. It can fit our model result well. This demonstrates our model is right, so we can design a software based on model to tell us a better application experiment protocol which can get better result.
Part4: Disscussion
Based the insight we have gained from modeling, we find that concentration of carbon dioxide is the major limitation of Synechocystis-Shewanella system. Because low concentration of carbon dioxide will limit photosynthesis of Synechocystis, producing less lactate. Finally it leads to low electricity production. (Rhodopseudomonas can utilize the metabolic waste of Shewanella, so it need less carbon dioxide) Therefore, we add carbon dioxide to system and find that it can improve the electricity production. However, if we add too much carbon dioxide, the production will decrease, because excess carbon dioxide will inhibit the photosynthesis. (David et al. 2015)[1]1Finally, we find that the system has the highest voltage output when we add carbon dioxide 2.103×10-4g⁄h.
