Cell growth, sampling, and assay  Make a 1:10 dilution of each overnight culture in LB+Chloramphenicol (0.5mL of                            culture into 4.5mL of LB+Chlor)  Measure Abs600 of these 1:10 diluted cultures  Record the data in your notebook  Dilute the cultures further to a target Abs600 of 0.02 in a final volume of 12 ml LB                                        medium + Chloramphenicol in 50 mL falcon tube   Take 500 µL samples of the diluted cultures at 0 hours into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes,                                           prior to incubation. Place the samples on ice.   Incubate the remainder of the cultures at 37°C and 220 rpm for 6 hours.   Take 500 µL samples of the cultures at 6 hours of incubation into 1.5 ml eppendorf                            tubes. Place samples on ice.  At the end of sampling point you need to measure your samples (Abs600 and                           fluorescence measurement)   Record data in  notebook  Import data into Excel sheet provided (fluorescence measurement tab)

 Type of media we used for this step: Luria Bertani
 Type of vessel or container we used to grow cells: 50 ml Falcon tube
 Temperature setting:22℃
 Type of 96-well plates: Black plates with transparent/clear bottom (preferred),flat
 Measurement: Measure OD and fluorescence of all samples
 Suggested Plate Layout for 96-well Plate
Result
Counting colony-forming units (CFUs) from the sample.
This measurement, related to cell concentration of the culture, can be used to calibrate OD600 to colony forming unit (CFU) counts.
We measured and dilute our overnight cultures to OD600=0.1, and we checked the OD600 to ensure we have diluted to 0.1.Also,we did this in triplicate for each culture.
