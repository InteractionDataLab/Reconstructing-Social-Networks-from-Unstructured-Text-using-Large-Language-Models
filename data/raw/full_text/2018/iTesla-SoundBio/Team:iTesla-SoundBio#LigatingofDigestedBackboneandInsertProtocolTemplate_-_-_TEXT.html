Highlighted text are things that you need to fill in or change for your particular lab notebook depending on the variables, and concentrations.
 
Ligation of digested backbone and digested insert:
***To figure out volume of reactants in ligation reactions:***
Measure the concentration of the digested backbone in the nanodrop.
Using the NEBiocalculator , enter the insert length and vector length, and the vector mass that we want.
For example:
Insert Length (FC 1) → 1482 bp
Vector Length → 2114 bp (psb1a3), 2070 bp (psb1c3)
Vector Mass → 50 ng, vector volumn 50ng / conc
Insert Mass
Find the required mass of the insert that maintains a 3 :1 ratio (insert to vector).
Divide the required insert mass by the insert concentration to get the volume of insert that you need.
To find the volume of vector, take what you used for the vector mass (50 ng) and divide by the vector concentration to get the vector vector volume that you need.
 
Materials:
- digested insert [        ]
-gel extracted vector [             ]
