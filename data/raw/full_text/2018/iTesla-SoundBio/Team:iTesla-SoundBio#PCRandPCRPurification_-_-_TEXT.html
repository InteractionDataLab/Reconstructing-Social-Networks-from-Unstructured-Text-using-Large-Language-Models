PCR Purification (with QIAquick Kit from Qiagen)
Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to the sample and pipette up and down to mix.
Transfer the mixture to a spin column and centrifuge for 1 min at 17,900 rcf. Discard flow-through.
Add 750 uL of Buffer PE to the column and centrifuge for 1 min at 17,900 rcf. Discard flow-through.
Centrifuge for another 1 min to remove residual ethanol.
Transfer column to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube
Add 30 uL of Elution Buffer onto the center of the column membrane and let sit for 5 min.
Centrifuge for 2 min at 17,900 rcf.
Check the concentration of the sample with Nanodrop.
