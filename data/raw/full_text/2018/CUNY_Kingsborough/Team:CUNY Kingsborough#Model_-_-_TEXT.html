Modeling Overview
This year, the team performed modeling of 2 distinct systems that would benefit from EtBr DNA quantification. We continued last year's work by using two types of models to characterize the absorption states of a light-operated kill switch for wastewater treatment E. coli. We also sought to understand and tune pattern formation in a biological system that was recently demonstrated to exhibit Turing patterns (Karig 2016). Lastly, having started iGEM at Kingsborough in 2016 without much knowledge of modeling, we wanted to create an informal guide to pay forward what we learned and provide a starting place for fellow beginners.
