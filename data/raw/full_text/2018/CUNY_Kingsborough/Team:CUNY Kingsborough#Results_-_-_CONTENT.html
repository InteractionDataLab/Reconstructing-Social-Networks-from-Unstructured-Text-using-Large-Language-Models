We almost must characterize the predictive ability of the standard curve using some known DNA concentration that is not used for the curve. Kasap et al. (2006) has shown that it is possible to approximate the concentration of DNA using Imagej.  In this study we will use a linear regression model to find:</P><DIV class="no-rise-padding"><UL><LI>Is there a measurable pixel difference?</LI><LI>What are the factors that affect pixel intensity?</LI></UL></DIV><H2 class="default-padding">Methods</H2><P class="low-rise-padding">Statistical analysis was done with R-studio and the Standard Curve was generated using Excel. Mass action model was done using Wolfram Mathematica. Data was entered into Excel and standardized using the following fomula:

Zero ng of DNA was used as the reference variable. The overall model fit was R^2 = 0.57, F-statistics = 41.02, p&lt;.001.</P><P class="low-rise-padding">This goes in contrast to our Mass-Action model which shows that the amount of EtBr has a significant effect on the pixel intensity. However, it is obvious that EtBr is needed for DNA to fluorescent therefore a future study should examine at what concentration of EtBr do we see no fluorescent when the amount of DNA is varied.</P><CENTER><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SMALL>Fig 3.

We found that amount of DNA (β=20.99, p&lt;0.05) and EtBr (β=-0.38, p&lt;0.05) are significant factors to pixel intensity. Background is not a significant contributor to pixel intensity. The overall model is significant (R2=0.387, F-statistics = 14.28, p&lt;0.01).</P><CENTER><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SMALL>Fig 4.

According to the residual, our model seems to under predict observed values and over predict lower values. This suggests that our model has not account for all the possible variables.</P><CENTER><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SMALL>Fig 5.

DNA concentration (β=5.08, p&lt;0.05) and background (β=-28.38, p&lt;0.05) are significant contributors to pixel intensity. The results in Figure 3 suggests that the background-though we subtracted the background pixel intensity-is still a significant contributor to overall pixel intensity.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
