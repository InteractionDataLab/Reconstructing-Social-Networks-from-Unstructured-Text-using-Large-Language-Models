Accurate  and  quick  determination  of  DNA  concentration  is  critical  for  the  assembly  of  synthetic  constructs,  as  well  as  a  multitude  of  other  experiments.  We  sought  to  optimize  an  under-utilized  and  inexpensive  approach  for  determining  DNA  concentration:  a  spotting  technique  that  uses  the  intercalating  dye  Ethidium  Bromide.  This  technique  does  not  require  specialized  equipment  such  as  a  spectrophotometer,  but  instead  relies  on  visualization  of  dye-DNA  complex  fluorescence  when  excited  by  UV  light.  We  modelled  and  tested  a  range  of  parameters  for  dye  concentration  and  spot  size,  finding  that  15uL  spots  with  1.0ug/mL  Ethidium  Bromide  produced  the  most  reliable  standard  curve. A detailed paper with our findings from 2017 data can be found here: <A id="bodyLink" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/27/289108">Quantification of DNA samples by Ethidium Bromide Spot Technique</A>.</P><H2 class="low-rise-padding">Protocol</H2><P class="low-rise-padding">Below is the procedure used for data collection in 2017 and what we sent to iGEM teams in 2018 as part of <A id="bodyLink" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:CUNY_Kingsborough/Collaborations">Collaboration</A>:</P><P class="low-rise-padding">5-15uL of diluted Ethidium Bromide was pipetted onto a disposable plastic petri dish. 1uL of water or diluted lambda DNA was then pipetted into the droplet/spot containing the dye and mixed. The dish was then inverted over a UV transilluminator. A cover shielded ambient light and a photograph was taken using an orange light filter and an android smartphone (Motorola Droid 2).</P><H2 class="low-rise-padding">Image Processing</H2><P class="low-rise-padding">Images of the spots were processed using ImageJÂ®. Briefly, spots were selected using a freehand or oval tool, either to analyze the entire spot(Whole Area) or the region within the spot with the brightest uniform intensity (Highest Fluorescence). Pixel intensity was measured using the analysis tool, with or without a de-speckling correction applied first (Noise reduction). These measurements were either taken as a ratio to a background signal and/or normalized to the maximum value for a set, and averaged across multiple experiments.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
