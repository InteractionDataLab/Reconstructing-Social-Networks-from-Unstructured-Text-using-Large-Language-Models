	One of the main pursuits of system biology is developing the ability to control and tune complex biological systems. Another is understanding how system properties (those within itself as well as those in relation to another system) arise.
<B>Modeling</B> is an interdisciplinary practice in systems biology that provides answers to these questions by using computing abilities. The first step in the process is to identify key components and interactions and then creating a model that replicates the interactions and enables one to gain meaningful insight about the system as a whole.

Modeling also has practical benefits (time \(\equiv\) money as they say) when it comes to experimenting with complex systems. You might never see the same results twice after spending weeks in a lab but you can run a computer simulation and achieve reproduceable results within minutes. Learning how to conduct basic modeling is essential to reducing the strain on lab efforts and supporting your results with theoretical rigor.</P><CENTER><DIV class="codebox"><CODE>

Introduction to ODEs</H2><P class="low-rise-padding">A function takes in a number and spits another one out (in the case of real-valued functions of real numbers). In a biological system, we can represent the concentration of a molecule as a function of time. However, we typically don't know what this function looks like. What we do know is the rate at which a molecule is consumed and produced in a reaction. From Section 3, we know that <B>the rate of change is a function of concentration at a given point in time</B>.</P><P class="low-rise-padding">A differential equation represents the relationship between a function \(y\) and its derivative \(y'\)- a separate function that represents the rate of change of \(y\). Generally, function \(y\) can depend on many variables. However, in an <B>ordinary differential equation</B> (ODE), it is only allowed to depend on one. Thus the general form of an ODE is given by</P><P>$$f(t,y,y',\ldots ,y^n)=0$$</P><P class="low-rise-padding">where \(y\) is a function of \(t\) and \(y^n\) is the nth derivative of \(y\).
