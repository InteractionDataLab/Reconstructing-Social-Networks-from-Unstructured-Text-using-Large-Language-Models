Data Collection for the EtBr Spot Protocol
We want our standard curve to be able to predict concentrations from varying levels of pixel intensity. In order to do so, we needed a larger and more diverse dataset. So we asked iGEM teams to perform the following task: dilute 1 uL of DNA of an unknown concentration into 9 uL EtBr (1 ng/uL), photograph the samples under UV light, and send us the images. Using ImageJÂ®, we compared the pixel intensity of the sample with a known DNA concentration to the predicted pixel intensity based on our standard curve.

Predicting Collateral Cleavage Activity of Cas13a
Cas9 - a cleaving RNA in CRISPR technology
We collaborated with the Columbia University iGEM Team to help them model the collateral cleavage activity of Cas13a, an enzyme used to cleave RNA in CRISPR technology. Our team provided the base system of equations and simulated the equations. See the details here.
Exchanging Ideas
Thanks to the HD Resolution Team in NYC, USA, we collaborated to host an event to present our projects to each other. They learned about the EtBr Spot Protocol and the light operon and we learned about their goal to cure Huntington's Disease. It was a great experience!
