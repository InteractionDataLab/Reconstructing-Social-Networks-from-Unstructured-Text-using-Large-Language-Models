BBa_K2567000 : nicA (Nicotine oxidoreductase)
The part code for the nicA protein. This protein can degrade nicotine. Nicotine oxidoreductase (nicA) from Pseudomonas putida S16 is the first enzyme in the pyrrolidine pathway for nicotine degradation.
We optimization the nicA in order to express protein successfully. Including but not limited to:
• Codon usage bias
• GC content
• CpG dinucleotides content
• mRNA secondary structure
• Cryptic splicing sites
• Premature PolyA sites
• Internal chi sites and ribosomal binding sites
• Negative CpG islands
• RNA instability motif (ARE)
• Repeat sequences (direct repeat, reverse repeat, and Dyad repeat)
• Restriction sites that may interfere with cloning
Additional sequences we propose to improve translational performance
(1) To increase the efficiency of translational initiation
• Kozak sequence
• Shine-Dalgarno Sequence
(2) To increase the efficiency of translational termination
• Stop codon(TAA)

BBa_K2567001 : express nicA and degrade nicotine
Use a promoter (BBa_J23119), ribosome binding site (BBa_B0034), nicA coding region (BBa_K2567000), terminator(BBa_B0015). This part can express nicA, and nicA can degrade nicotine.
