Zhuoyi Yang (Joyce):
I’m Zhuoyi Yang from IB program, and the team leader of this year’s team. I was also a team                         member                         in last year’s team and I fell in love with the iGEM adventure. In this year, I organised the team member selection and gave training to the new iGEMer during winter holiday. I guided team members                         to                         brainstorm projects and separated them to groups to research more deeply on each module. To                         give                         better instruction to our team, I invited Cheng Li from Peking University as our instructor,                         and                         was in charge of communicating between teachers and the team. I planned for the summer holiday                         experiment as well as human practice and tried my best to borrow necessary equipments from some                         labs. Moreover, I distributed tasks to team members in presentation preparation and wiki writing                         process. It is a great pleasure to work with my team mates and I hope to be a lifelong                         iGEMer.
Jingxu Yan (Levana):
I’m Levana, a team member of 2018 BNDS China. Now I in 11 IB programs and I am 15 years old. I                         take                         charge in the wet lad, human practice, and some visual creation of our team. I love biology,                         and by                         joining the iGEM competition, I realize that theories are different from experiments, some time                         we                         need to do a lot of trials in order to great the right solution.
Guanghua Hao (Charles):
I’m Charles, a team member of 2018 BNDS China. I am in Grade 12 AP program. I advocated with my                         teammates a school fund for scientific research; I worked with the experiment group at the                         different labs to learn techniques of synthesis and analysis; I also designed the pamphlets for                         the                         human practice portion of our project.
Zitian Ye (Kelly):
I am Zitian Ye. Aside from collecting information regarding antimicrobial peptides, I                         participated                         mainly in wet lab and human practice. The majority of my lab works were demonstration:                         measuring                         the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) of antimicrobial peptides as well as the efficiency                         of                         different types of promoters. For the human practice part, I organized the visit to the fish                         farm                         to learn about aquaculture, sold our project-related products to popularize synthetic biology,                         and                         interviewed merchants selling ornamental fish.
Ziqi Zhao (Tom):
Hi! My name is Ziqi Zhao, a high school senior student at BNDS. I mainly participated in the wet                         lab, helped with human practice, and I’ll be responsible for a part of the presentation. I’m                         very excited to be in our iGEM team because I’m interested in synthetic biology and planning to                         take biological engineering for my college major. When I’m not working in the lab, I find                         happiness in music and performing arts. No kidding. A biology student who sings well.
Yinting Huang (Justin):
My name is Yinting Huang, a team member of BNDS_China. I took part in the project research                         section and help our team to narrow down the topics. Furthermore, in the wet lab, I engaged in                         the modeling of the AMP and quorum quenching proteins. Last but not least, I am one of the                         designers and planners in the team and in charge of designing the bookmarks, the turntable,                         team uniforms and human practice activities.
Zihan Zhang (Steven):
I am prospective to learn applied mathematics in the undergraduate stage, and I am engaged to                         extensively utilize the modeling knowledge and programming skills. I have learned some                         algorithm and function about data analysis originally in class, but I never had the chance to                         apply them practically. My experience is sparse and all knowledge is literally understood. iGEM                         2018 gave me a great chance to incorporate math with other natural science and broaden my                         horizon of knowledge comprehension. I took charge of visualization and data analysis,                         discovering the density function and variation tendency. Throughout the process, I recognize                         how worthy and useful the mathematics is. I am willing to devote myself to the future                         researches.

Xilin Yang (Sallina):
I am Xilin Yang, a Grade 12 student from IB program. As a student leader in our team, I                             participated in recruiting and selecting new team members to start a team. In the stage of                             research, I selected information about antimicrobial peptides that target on A. hydrophila                             but                             are not harmful to E. coli. During summer vacation, I participated in wet lab, including                             Interlab, constructing parts, and extracting and testing the peptides. In September and                             October, I took part in planning presentation, writing and revising wiki, and designing                             poster.                             iGEM gives me a platform to preview a life for research in lab and my partners' effortless                             hardwork in the project gives me the courage to finish the process.

My name is Purple, and I’m in Grade 12 IB program. In our early research period, I focused on                         searching the suitable Antimicrobial peptides to kill the A. Hydrophila. Later, I mostly                         participated in the InterLab, wet lab, and the collaboration with other teams.  Later,  I mostly                          participated in the InterLab, wet lab, and the collaboration with other teams. In addition to                          helping composing our wiki pages and drawing some of our illustrations including the initial                          sketch of our team logo, I also integrated our presentation PPT and helped design the poster.  Thanks to iGEM, I am now familiar                         with a series of advanced biotechnologies.
Yuezhang Zhou(Mackie):
As one of the 12th graders in the team, I involved in early literature research and wet-lab during the summer. In the literature research part, I was one of the main members who are responsible for the Quorum Quenching part and have made my own contribution to the determination of the project. Also, I participated in the experimental process and conducted experiments, including but not limited to PCR, gel electrophoresis & recycle. Besides, I designed the team logo based on the idea given by another team member. It is my greatest honor to be one of the team and make contribution to the team.
