Summary</H2><P>Our model helped us to optimize the <I>A. hydrophila</I> sensor devices. At first,
we measured the concentration of C4-HSL in <I>A.
hydrophila</I> culture by using mass spectrum. Then, we tested the GFP
production rate of sensor device I. The experimental results were characterized
by using Hill equation, which modelled the GFP synthesis rate as a function of
input concentration of the inducer, C4-HSL. However, when we predicted the
efficiency of this device in real environment by the derived function, we found
the fluorescence was too low to be detected. Therefore, we adjusted our design
by increasing rhlR RBS strength and modelled the experimental results by using
Hill equation again. This time, we found the device’s (BBa_K2548001) fluorescence
in real environment was enough to be detected. More importantly, our model can
help to indicate the <I>A. hydrophila</I>
concentration in different environments, and alerts the aquaculture managers
the danger of pathogen infection. In addition, we visualize the data in
three-dimensions to show how GFP production rate per cell over time at different C4-HSL inducer
concentrations to characterize the sensor in a more comprehensive way. </P><H2>II. Assumptions</H2><OL><LI> When the concentration of   changes, the synthesis rate of GFP increases, and its fluorescence increases.</LI><LI> GFP synthesis rate is only affected by the concentration of C4-HSL, and the relationship can be simplified into a non-linear function (Hill equation).</LI><LI>The function of relevant proteins is assumed stable throughout the experiment. </LI><LI>The difference between individual subtype of bacteria is omitted.</LI></OL><H2>III. Design of Characterizations </H2><P>In order to characterize the expression system, we first acquired the experiment data of 
 GFP production rate per cell (RFU per Abs per min) under different
 concentration of inducers  (M) (see <A href="/Team:BNDS_CHINA/Experiments">experiment</A>). Then the experimental
data were fitted using the Hill equation:</P><P>In biochemistry, the binding ability
of a ligand to a macromolecule is often increased if other ligands have already
present on the same macromolecule. The hill equation is used to determine the cooperativeness
of a ligand binding to its receptor, and it can describe the relationship
between the expression level of genes which are regulated and the quantity of
regulatory factors. </P><P>We model the GFP synthesis rate 
 () as a function of input concentration of 
 
 (). The four parameters 
 (, 
 , 
 , 
 
) were estimated to obtain the best fit curve by performing a
non-linear curve fitting using the experimental data. Among the parameters, n
is the Hill coefficient, which describes the cooperativity; C is the
concentration of C4-HSL (M) which produces half occupation. This curve fitting was performed using Logger Pro. (Saeidi <I>et
al</I>, 2011).</P><H2>IV. Results of Characterizations of Sensor Device I and Device II</H2><DIV align="center">Fig 1.

 these results at <A href="/Team:BNDS_CHINA/Demonstrate">demonstrate</A>.</P><H2>V. Visualization of Data in Three-Dimensions</H2><P>The GFP production rate is converted as RFU per Abs per min,
calculated through the arithmetic average of three trails to eliminate the
systematic and experimental errors. The three axes are named respectively as
Time (min), 
 , and GFP
production rate. The three variables are defined respectively in different
sets, automatically imported from Excel to maintain the efficiency and
productivity of modeling. </P><P>Time( t ) ∈ [ 0,220 ] with interval of 10mins . </P><P> C4-HSL concentration ( M ) ∈ [ 
  ,
  ] for geometric
sequence of ratio of 5 . To maintain the integrity of image, the value of
concentration is replaced by marks from 1-15. </P><P>GFP production rate ∈ [ 0,4 ] from experimental test experience. </P><P>The modeling is achieved through Mathematica 11. All discrete
points are contained in manual data set. To show the variation tendency of
data, we took MeshFunction to connect the adjacent
points and present the regional changing trend, like the concavity or
convexity. To specify and highlight the progressive changes of GFP production
rate, we took the PlotLegends Function of Colorful
pattern. The three-dimension graph can be rotated 360 degrees and observed from
different views.</P><DIV align="center">Fig 4. Visualization of Sensor Device I Experiment Data</DIV><DIV align="center">Fig 5. Visualization of Sensor Device III Experiment Data</DIV><P>To illustrate the three-dimensional data in plane and the
