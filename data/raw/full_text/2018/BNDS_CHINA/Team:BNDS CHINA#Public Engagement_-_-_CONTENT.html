Public lecture</H3><P>Establishing club is an efficient way to share the knowledge and find the people who
        have the same interest. This year, we continued the club we established last year, and held a synthetic
        biology lecture at school.</P><P>Our goal was to popularize the synthetic biology to the students in our school.
        Since lots of people had a misunderstanding towards synthetic biology, we really wanted to dispel it.
        Therefore, we designed an interesting lecture to achieve this goal. We deeply understood that lots of
        students in our campus didn’t have enough knowledge of biology and they would feel bored if we teach them
        for whole class. In order to avoid such situation, we made an adequate preparation. We divided our lecture
        into three parts. The first part was a brief introduction of synthetic biology. We made a short video to
        clarify what synthetic biology is and its applications in the real world. What's more, we also emphasized the
        core of synthetic biology: modularization and standardization. </P><P>By interacting with the students who came to the lecture, their views toward
        synthetic biology was gradually refreshed.</P><P> The second part was the introduction of a typical genetic engineering process and
        some basic information of genetic biology, including DNA structure, translation, PCR, etc. We wanted our
        club members to understand how the basics of biology can be used in synthetic biology.</P><P>Finally, since putting the knowledge into practice was really important, we designed
        a DNA extraction experiment. We used salts and detergent to break the cell membranes of bananas. Then, to
        increase the surface area of cells, we mashed the banana. We used a strainer to filter the banana puree and
        gained the solution contained DNA. Finally, by adding up alcohol, the DNA appeared at the bottom of the
        cup. The process of extraction is known as ethanol precipitation. The students enjoyed the experiment a lot
        and they gained interest in synthetic biology as well as iGEM competition. </P><H3>III. Red Window Expo</H3><P>The Red Window Expo is our school’s traditional activity. At the expo,
            students get an opportunity to show their versatile talents and sell their self-developed products.
            Moreover, student organizations can display their
            marvelous ideas and propagate their projects in the expo. This activity aims
            to nurture students’ individuality, inspire creativity, facilitate the interaction
            between different grades and enrich the campus culture.</P><P>It was a tradition for our team to promote our project in the Red Window Expo. To
            draw students attention while incorporating the idea of synthetic biology
            into the activity, our team ingeniously designed a series of captivating and
            yet educative activities to promote synthetic biology and our project on
            campus. We made various types of bookmarks with delicate illustrations and
            synthetic biology definitions on them. We also made a huge amount of
            palatable fortune cookies which contain a variety of biology questions. And
            only students who correctly answered the questions had access to the
            “Wheel of Fortune” and the opportunity to win special gifts. Besides, while
            organizing the activities, our teammates introduced our project and the
            knowledge of synthetic biology to the participants.</P><P>Our project draw tens of attention in the expo and was a huge success. A
            bountiful amount of students visit our stall and engaged in the colorful
            activities about synthetic biology. Students dabbled in the field of genetic
            engineering and appreciated the wisdom of biology with the lead of these
            activities. The expo also helped us to popularize iGEM in our school. Some
            students even expressed keen interest in taking part in the competition next
            year. Meanwhile, the biology teachers in our school provided us with a
            variety of fundamental suggestions such as the design of the experiment and
            the application of our genetically engineered machine, which are stepping
            stones to our final project.</P><H3>Feelings from team members:</H3><P>During the Red Window Expo, we sale our DIY book marks containing the
        knowledge about organelle and cookies on the during the red window expo.
        All the teachers and students are in a exiting and enjoyable atmosphere. I felt
        so satisfied when I was watching our customers who tried hard to answer
        the questions we made, bought our bookmarks, and ate the cookies. It was
        a fantastic experience.
        </P><P align="right">- By Levant Yan</P><P>This was my first time to be fully engaged in the Red Window Expo. I was in
        charge of designing, ordering, and selling fortune cookies. I was amazed by
        students' passion in biology and was happy to see that students managed to
        answer most of our questions about genetic engineering. I hope that more
        and more students will be interested in joining BNDS iGEM team next year!</P><P align="right">- By Mackie Zhou</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
