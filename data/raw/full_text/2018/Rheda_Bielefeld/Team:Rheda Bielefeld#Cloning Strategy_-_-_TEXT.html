Cloning Strategy
Cloning is one of the most important methods, so we cultivated Bacillus subtilis and Xanthomonas campestris to isolate their DNA.  Afterwards we wanted to seperate the Gene of Interest (GOI) which were pelB and yesZ from both of the bacteria. Then we built the vector which is used for every plasmid. For the characterization we used the pz9 and the psB1C3 vector for our BioBrick. Next we would have placed our Gene of Interest into the vector and duplicated it via PCR.  Finally we would have needed to place our finished plasmid into our E. coli to clone our final bacteria.  For more info, visit our Parts page .
