High School Einstein-Gymnasium
Our Team recently visits the high school Einstein-Gymnasium in Rheda. The school was established in 1969 and compromises now almost 1200 students and more than 100 teachers, including trainee teachers. Our school offers a lot of possibilities, especially in languages and sciences, like the iGEM project or different MINT projects, but also learning about other cultures and religions by discussions or travelling to other countries.
The iGEM competition was offered at our school for the very first time. We have often collaborated with the University of Bielefeld and has been organizing different workshops for students of our school who are interested in gaining insight into an actual lab. Since the university takes part in iGEM every year and the Centre for Biotechnology (CeBiTec) is often in contact with teachers of the Einstein-Gymnasium, we were offered to found our own iGEM Highschool team. We were going to be supported by teachers and scientists at the CeBiTec. Our team met at our school every other week, but we mainly worked on our project during the vacation. During this time, we learned and experimented on a completely different level than we could ever have experienced it in class.
