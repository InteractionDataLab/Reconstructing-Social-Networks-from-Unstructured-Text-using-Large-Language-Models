Incubate overnight at 37°C
Plasmid isolation was performed with the analytic Jena plasmid isolation kit. The enclosed protocol was used. It was changed a bit as the elution step was done with water instead of elution buffer.

242 g Tris Base
57.1 mL Glacial Acetic Acid
100 mL 0.5 M EDTA

Nanodrop ND2000 Spectrophotometer from PeqLab was used for DNA measurements.
After the separation of the plasmids and another insert was not possible only by using specific primers, we used restriction enzymes to cut out the unnecessary insert. Herefore we used the restriction enzymes EcoR I, Pst I, Xba I and Not I. These were used by adding 4 nl DNA to 2µl Buffer, 1µl restriction enzymes and 12µl of water. After incubating this mix at 37°C we inactivated everything at 80°C for 20 minutes. Hereby we hoped to separate the psb1C3 (2070 bp) from the mCherry-insert (711 bp). You can find the exact procedure here on the 21.08.2018

Pectin C, Pectin A and Amylopectin were purchased by Carl Roth.
Pectinase from Aspergillus Niger, which was used in the pectin assay as a positive control, was purchased by Sigma
The experiments with liquid nitrogen and trypsin as well as the primer design strategy were especially supported by the supervisors. No antibiotics were handled by team members.
Methods
We have used various different methods for our experiments. Here is an overview of the methods we have used.
Pollen
For our experiments with pollen, we have used two methods. The first method was using trypsin. Trypsin is an enzyme mostly found in the digestive system of many animals and can hydrolyze proteins. We have used it here in the hope that the trypsin would hydrolyze the proteins in the pollen´s outer wall and therefore making the pollen break. The Ribolyser consists of many little balls of ceramics and is used to homogenize biological samples. It works simple: you put a sample into the ribolyser and shake it well, in the best case with a mechanical shaker. By shaking it, the little ceramic balls fly around in the container and by crashing into the sample, a lot of damage can be done to your biological sample. A negative side effect of using the ribolyser is that a lot of heat is produced when the balls fly around. We used the ribolyser to break the pollens wall with both heat and the mechanical damage done. Another way we tried to break open the wall of a pollen was by using liquid nitrogen. When you put liquid nitrogen onto cells, they break because all liquids touching that extremely cold substance freeze and eventually break. We enhanced this process by using a mortar.
PCR
When we extracted the DNA from the leaves, we used a mortar, water, and some ethanol to gap their cellular wall. After crushing them we used filters from the "Nucleospin DNA Extraction Kit" to extract the DNA from the remains. When using this kit, you need two filters, one container for the flow-through, liquids included in the kit and a centrifuge. The kit basically binds the DNA to the filter, washes out everything else through the filter and in the end, you use an elution buffer to elute the DNA from the filter. For the PCR, you have to prepare your sample by adding the nucleotides, the primer, the polymerase, and some water. Afterward, you put the samples into the PCR machine. It goes through many cycles of changing temperatures. In that process, the DNA parts into two strings and the primers bind onto their complementary sequence and "shows" the polymerase where it has to start synthesizing on. Next, the polymerase goes along the string and copies the sequences with the opposite nucleotides. By that process, the DNA was multiplied. When the PCR was finished, we performed a gel electrophoresis. The gel electrophoresis consists of an agarose gel, TAE-buffer, an anode and a cathode, and a connection to electricity. Since the DNA has a negative charge, it moves towards the anode. The gel electrophoresis can be evaluated by putting it into a bath of a coloring chemical. The gel is afterward put into a dark chamber and gets lit by UV-Light. Hereby, the gel electrophoresis pictures resolve.
Assays
The cracking of pollen is related with the destruction of pectin and cellulose. Therefore we need enzymes like pectinase and cellulase. At first, it is important to prove the content of cellulose and pectin in specific substances. Therefore we used both natural and pure alcohol. If there were small bubbles in the substances to see, then we successfully proved pectin and cellulose in the samples. This is important for proving the appearance of pollen. After a while, pectinase and cellulase should have destructed the pectin and cellulose. The experiment is successfully performed if there aren't any bubbles in the samples.
NCBI
We visited the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) to get some information from their data base. With them we got to know the sequence of the amino acids in the DNA of the tree leaves we used. Afterwards we were able to check whether our results were correct.
