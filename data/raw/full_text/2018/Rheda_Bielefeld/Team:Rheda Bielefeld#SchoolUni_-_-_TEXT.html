Einstein Gymnasium Rheda
Our highschool team visits the Einstein-Gymnasium in Rheda. It was established in 1969 and compromises now almost 1200 students and more than 100 teachers and trainee teachers. Being this large our school offers a lot of possibilities, especially in languages and sciences, like the iGem project or different MINT projects, but also learning about other cultures and religions by discussing or travelling to other countries.
The iGEM competiton was offered for the first time this year at our school. We have often collaborated with the University of Bielefeld organizing different workshops for students of our school who are interested in gaining insight to an actual lab. Since the university takes part in iGEM every year and the Centre for Biotechnologies (CeBiTec) is often in contact with teachers of the Einstein-Gymnasium, we were offered to found our own iGEM Highschool team. We were going to be supported by teachers and scientists at the CeBiTec. Our team met at our school every other week, but we mainly worked on our project during the holidays. In this time, we learned and experimented on a completely different level than we could have in class.
