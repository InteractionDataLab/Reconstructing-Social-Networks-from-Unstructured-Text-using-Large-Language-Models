Safety form
The safety in laboratories, especially in such for genetic engineering, is pretty important before you start doing your PCR with birch pollen and turn on a gel electrophoresis.
One tiny mistake or one unlucky step cannot just ruin your research, but can also bring you and your team members in large trouble.
Because some organisms and material can be dangerous for the students and also for the environment, an essential part of participating on iGEM is to set rules and lines concerning the matters of lab safety.
Our thoughts on the plans we developed on our idea are therefore written down in the Safety Form and the article about Biosafety . There we mention the steps of ensuring safety in the lab and which material we used in context of our research.
