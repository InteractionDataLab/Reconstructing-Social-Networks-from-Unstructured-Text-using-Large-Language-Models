BBa_K2786004
nifB promoter(BBa_K2786002)->gfp(BBa_E0040)
About our parts
We measured activity of nifB promoter(BBa_K2786002) gene by using gfp as repoter gene.
①We made sample E.coli DH5α which has pSB1C3-gfp (No promoter:Negative control)
②We made sample E.coli DH5α which has pSB1C3-nifBpromotergfp (part BBa_K2786004)
③We made sample E.coli DH5α which has a part BBa_I20270.
We incubated these samples 8 h and measured fluorescence.
This is result

We could confirm that nifB promoter work properly. This result indicats that nifB promoter has higher transcription activity than part BBa_I20270.
We used this promoter to express nifBHDKNXhesA genes.  We can use this result to infer ammonia synthesis  by nitrogenase in the future. If we express nitrogenase by different promoter, we can refer to this value.
