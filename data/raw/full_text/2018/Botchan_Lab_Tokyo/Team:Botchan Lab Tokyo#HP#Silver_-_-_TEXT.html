Dissemination of science for High school students

Introductions about Botchan and IGem in University’s open campus
The team of Botchan have been making effort and work hard to disseminate science more easily based on university’s lesson.
From our experience, we consider what is most difficult in high school’s subject and what is most easily solution to disseminate science for high school students.
So, we had determined using the opportunity of open campus of Tokyo University of Science.
In building of lecture’s 1st floor, The team of Botchan had introduced about competition of Igem as well as what is biology included synthetic biology.
By the influence that Noda campus in Tokyo university of science has a Faculty of Science and Technology, and a Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Almost of the people had interested in the team of Botchan’s exhibition.
Also It was the great experience teaching someone.
Being as a result, Dissemination using a exhibition was successful. Also we expect next year’s open campus event.
Dissemination of science for parents and child using biological experiment.
The team of Botchan has been making effort and work hard to disseminate science more easily based on university’s lesson.
From our University’s lesson, The achievement of fate of Country’s advance from the dissemination of natural science, The team of Botchan determine to open the Science class in university.
This time, The team of Botchan’s purpose is making a scientific interest for children.
So, We have a lesson about what is DNA and it’s role in the body. Also, we want to show shape of DNA in real not a theoretical shape.
The team of Botchan and participants make an experiments of DNA extraction from Broccoli and view a genetically exchanged Escherichia coli experimentally.
Participants have a great interest in experiments and result.
Also, It can be a opportunity to make dream or interest in Scientific area.
For dissemination of science for everyone based on university’s lesson, we’ll never give up.
To make the world there’s no discrimination or barrier in scientific area, The team of Botchan works hard now on.
Survey
In order to enhance our projects, we did a survey about awareness of food problem and genetic modified food to teams from different countries such as Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Ecuador, Egypt, Japan, Mexico, the USA and so on. Also, we did a survey to people who are family or friends of our team members. As a result, we could collect answer from 341 people. We would like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to you all.
Our project focus on food problem, and we think many people who live in wealthy countries don’t take it seriously about the food problem. Therefore, we tried hard to make the general public pay attention to food problem. Through our survey, we are surprised how many people think their countries don’t feel a sense of danger about the food problem. Even if many people have learned about food problem in their school class, they don’t have a chance to think deeply about food problem. Also, even if they learned something about the problem, they don’t think they have a possibility of suffering from shortage of food. Therefore, our human practice activities and project could cause the general public to pay attention to food problem, and rethink about the problem. Also, through activities we use synthetic biology, and that were good opportunity to spread synthetic biology.
We also took a survey about genetically modified food. Since we aren’t familiar with genetically modified food, we thought many people think it is dangerous to eat genetically modified food. As a result, almost half of the people who answered survey don’t think it is dangerous, but more than half of the people have some barriers to eating genetically modified food. In reality, if there is a few people who think it is dangerous to eat the one, we are difficult to put our project to practical use, because we can’t get any money to continue our project toward more practical way. In order to get them to understand it is safe, we need to give a course. In this year, we made many chances to promote genetically modified and we think it is really valuable time for the general public to learn the one.
However, we think our activities are not enough to solve the problem which is to decrease people who have negative impression to genetically modified food. We think if we  interview researcher who have same problem as us, we can get valuable advice, and improve our project. Therefore, we visited National Agriculture and Food Research Organization(NARO), and interviewed researcher whose research is related to genetically modified food. We think
