Both teams gave presentations and had an exchange of opinions. So, we could sophisticate our projects each other. Furthermore, We shared ideas about not only projects of experiments but also activities of teams, to name a few, how to manage a team, chances of practicing presentations and how to educate new students. We could get a lot of instructive views for our teams. The meeting with them was very meaningful. </P><P class="piko">University of Kyoto developed the software to complete experiment data in Wiki and provided it to us. When you input experiment date like experimenter’s names, date and the amount of chemicals, this software translate the information into HTML. It enabled us to make wiki easily and quickly. In fact, we used this software and edited the page of experiment. Moreover, we felt it’s very useful for the team that are not familiar with engineering and for creating wiki simplify. We cooperated with improvement of it by providing feedback.</P><H4>iGEM East Japan Meetup 2018</H4><P class="piko">On August 8th, we met up with iGEM Tokyo_Tech, iGEM Gifu team, KAIT Japan and ASIJ iGEM team. Each team gave a presentation followed by a Q&amp;A in English and exchanged feedback. Also, we discussed project ideas, funding issues, how to drive a team and so on. This meetup helped to improve our presentation skill and team-managing skill, and to get hints that can have a good effect on our experiment.<A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Kyoto/Collaborations" target="_blank">

" target="_blank">2018.igem.org/Team:Gifu</A>
）.

They introduced us their project by showing us a PDF file (<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2018/7/70/T--Botchan_Lab_Tokyo--Collaborations.pdf" target="_blank">You can download the file from here</A>).
Their team tried to produce functional protein from the circular RNA in PURE system, a kind of cell-free system.
They said that the largest benefit of the production of protein in cell-free system is that purifying produced protein is much easier than protein produced in vivo such as in E.coli.
Also, they taught us how to meet criteria for iGEM, since this is the second time for us to participate in iGEM Jamboree and we were not so sure about the criteria.
On the other hand, we introduced our project to them and gave advice about the methods of efficient cloning.</P><P>PI of iGEM Gifu, Prof. Iwahashi was once studying nitrogen fixation. So, they offered us a scientific article written by him.
Referring to that paper, we discussed our project, including nitrogenase, culture conditions, cloning methods with them.
It was very meaningful and productive collaboration. Thanks! iGEM Gifu!</P><FOOTER id="footer-elements"><DIV id="footer-right"><H1>Contact </H1></DIV><DIV id="footer-left"><H1>Sponsor</H1></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
