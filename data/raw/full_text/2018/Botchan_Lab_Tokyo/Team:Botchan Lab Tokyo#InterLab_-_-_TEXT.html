OD600 Reference point - LUDOX Protocol
We used LUDOX CL-X (45% colloidal silica suspension) as a single point reference to obtain a conversion factor to transform absorbance(Abs600) data from plate reader into a comparable OD600 measurement as would be obtained in a spectrophotometer. We showed the results in Table 1.
Table 1: Abs600 and OD600 of LUDOX CL-X and H2O
2 Particle Standard Curve - Microsphere Protocol
We used a dilution series of monodisperse silica microspheres and measured the Abs600 in plate reader. (We showed the results in Table 2.)
Over, we made a standard curve of particle concentration which can be used to convert Abs600 measurements to an estimated number of cells using this measurements. (We showed the results in Figure 1.)
Table2: Abs600 of monodisperse silica microspheres
Figure.1: standard curve of particle concentration
3 Fluorescence standard curve - Fluorescein Protocol
In order to compare fluorescence output of test devices between teams, it is necessary for each team to create a standard fluorescence curve, using the small molecule fluorescein which has similar excitation and emission properties to GFP. (We showed the results in Table3 and Figure 2.)
Table3: fluorescence intensity of fluorescein

Cell measurement !!!!!!
We measured Abs600and fluorescence of Escherichia coli DH5α transformants.

Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E.coli cultures
We did a dilution series to investigate the ration (culture: medium) which can transform the measured OD600 of our overnight cultures to 0.1 OD600.
Table7: OD600 of each dilution rate
We calculated “fixed 0.1OD600” (each score - blank).
Table8: fixed 0.1OD600
From table8, we decided the best ratio:Sample1;positive1→10^5 and negative1→10^5:Sample2;positive2→10^5 and negative2→10^5. To check if this ratio is proper, we did a dilution at such ratio.
Table9: a checked OD600
Next, we performed a dilution series with triplicates for each overnight culture and plated the 8 x 104, 8 x 105, and 8 x 106 dilutions. Assuming that one bacteria gives rise to one colony, we counted the number of colonies per plate and multiplied by the final dilution factor to obtain a CFU/mL value for a starting sample of OD600.
