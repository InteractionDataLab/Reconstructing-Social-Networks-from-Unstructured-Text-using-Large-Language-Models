Human Practices Overview
Our Human Practices involved around two main axes: Reinforcing the presence of Synthetic Biology in the Greek Educational System ( Education & Public Engagement ) and Improving our project through specialists’ feedback ( Integrated Human Practices ). Below you can find a timeline of our human practices-related actions:
22.01.18 - Discussion with Dr Petros Eliadis and Dr Pelly Foka @Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece
Discussing with specialists on the field of Diagnostics was a major goal of our Integrated Human Practices. Dr Eliadis and Dr Foka gave us insight on the topic of Travel Medicine, underlying the current needs in Diagnostics. Through this discussion we finalized our choice on working on MERS-CoV.
27.04.18 - Athens Science Festival @Athens Technopolis, Greece
Organized by Sci-Co (Science Communication), the Athens Science Festival brings together people with one common love: Science! Of course, our team was there!
03.05.18 - “SynBio: Engineering Life” Presentation @Arsakeion 2nd Lyceum (High School)
The first in our cycle of three high school presentations, an effort to introduce Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology to high school students. 10th and 11th grade students.
07.05.18 - “SynBio: Engineering Life” @Athens College Lyceum (High School)
The second in our cycle of three high school presentations, an effort to introduce Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology to high school students. 11th grade students.
17.05.18 - “SynBio: Engineering Life” @Ionideios Model Lyceum (High School)
The third in our cycle of three high school presentations, an effort to introduce Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology to high school students. 10th grade students.
20.06.18 - Discussion with Dr Lee Alissandratos, Australian National University @Skype
In our effort to strengthen our Proof of Concept and present a reasonable design, we discussed with Dr Alissandratos, a Synthetic Biology expert, in a video call. He provided us great feedback and new ideas.
05.07.18 - “SynBio Workshop: The Principles of Engineering Life” @NTUA, Athens, Greece
In collaboration with iGEM Thessaloniki, we organized and hosted in our university a Workshop on the Principles of Synthetic Biology for University Students of various educational backgrounds. We sought to demonstrate that Synthetic Biology is an interdisciplinary field of particular interest and beauty.
25-29.07.18 - 5th Synthetic and Systems Biology Summer School @Siena, Italy
Two of our team members participated in the 5th International Synthetic and Systems Biology Summer School because of their interest in learning more about synthetic biology. At the same time, it was an excellent opportunity for our team to demonstrate its work in the poster section.
06.09.18 - Short Discussion with Prof Keith Pardee, University of Toronto @e-mail
Discussing with specialists on the field of Molecular Diagnostics and Synthetic Biology was a primary goal of our Integrated Human Practices. We reached out to Prof Pardee for several design-related questions and gained valuable feedback.
08.09.18 - BioExcel SIG Meeting - ECCB 2018 @Eugenides Foundation, Athens, Greece
Two of our team members participated in the BioExcel SIG Meeting, the topic of which was the advancement of computational methods for biomolecular research. Our team presented its poster, discussed with specialists on our work as well as on our models and got valuable feedback from Prof. Syma Khalid (University of Southampton) and Dr. George Papadatos (GlaxoSmith Kline).
11.09.18 - Short Discussion with Dr Robert Maegher, Sandia National Laboratories @e-mail
Discussing with specialists on the field of Diagnostics was a major goal of our Integrated Human Practices. We reached out to Sandia National Laboratories, USA and gained feedback on our proposed diagnostic device.
15.09.18 - Discussion with Biologist Panagiotis Doukas @Analysis Medical Laboratories, Athens, Greece
Discussing with specialists on the field of Diagnostics was a major goal of our Integrated Human Practices. Thus, we reached out to Analysis Medical Laboratories and gained feedback on our proposed diagnostic mechanism.
17.09.18 - Discussion with Prof Aashish Priye, University of Cincinnati @Skype
Discussing with specialists on the field of Point-of-Care Detection for Global Health was a major goal of our Integrated Human Practices. Professor Priye helped us clarify many technical aspects of our product design, so as to be considered suitable for POC Diagnostics.
19.09.18 - Discussion with Professor Kosmas Haralampidis @Biology Faculty, NKUA, Athens, Greece
Discussing with specialists on the topic of Synthetic Biology and the Greek Society and Educational System played a major role in shaping our proposals for the Education & Public Engagement report. Therefore, we reached out to Prof. Haralampidis, whose research focuses on molecular and developmental plant biology.
19.09.18 - Meeting with the Hellenic Society of Point-of-Care Testing @Athens, Greece
Discussing with specialists on the field of Diagnostics was a major goal of our Integrated Human Practices. Thus, we reached out to the specialists of the field, the Hellenic Society of Point-of-Care Testing and gained valuable feedback that had an essential impact our project.
19.09.18 - Discussion with Dr Maria-Nefeli Tsaloglou, Diagnostics for All @Skype
Discussing with specialists on the subject of designing diagnostic devices for the developing world influenced fundamentally our Product Design, in the context of Integrated Human Practices. Dr Tsaloglou shared her experience with us and helped us define certain parameters in our design.
29.09.18 - Researcher’s Night @Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece
Our team presented its work at the Doctoral and Post-Doc Research Meeting, hosted by the Hellenic Pasteur Institute, an event organized among others for the Researcher’s Night.
02.10.18 - Discussion with Prof Helen Giamarellou, Athens University Medical School @Hygeia Hospital, Athens, Greece
Discussing with specialists on the field of Infectious Diseases, was a primary goal while developing our project. We reached out to Professor Giamarellou in order to discuss possible next steps for our project and the current needs in diagnostics, especially concerning other diseases in which our mechanism could be applied.
15.10.18 - Freshmen Welcome Ceremony - School of Chemical Engineering @NTUA, Athens, Greece
As a team that was under the auspices of the School of Chemical Engineering, we were proud to present our work to the new generation of chemical engineers. A major point of our presentation was the connection between Engineering and Synthetic Biology.
