                            Our team participated in the annual Athens Science Festival on April 2018, an event organized by Sci-Co (Science Communication) that brings together students, teachers, professors and researchers, families, and everyone sharing one passion: science.
                        </P><P>
                            Students of all ages, from elementary school to university students, joined our discussions. Because of the variety of age groups and their respective biological background, our approach was more fundamental and our team focused on the basics of Biology.
                            <SPAN class="read-more-target">
                            Among the discussions, the following were included:

                                                Microorganisms of everyday life: Sampling from everyday objects and places (cell phone, bus, toilet sink, sunglasses), we presented different types of bacterial and fungal colonies that are present in our daily routine.
                                            </DIV></LI><LI><DIV>
                                                Fluorescent Bacteria: Taking the demonstration one step further, we transformed E. coli by adding a plasmid containing the GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) encoding gene. Shining a blacklight on our petri dish, everyone was able to observe the fluorescence. At the same time, we engaged in discussions concerning the origin of GFP and how it is possible for a bacterium to attain the fluorescence ability.
                                            </DIV></LI></UL><LI><DIV>
                                        Discussion on the basics of life: Engaging elementary and high school students we discussed about life, living organisms, cells, bacteria, viruses, the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and, finally, the ability to intervene and tinker with the genome of a selected organism.
                                    </DIV></LI><P>
                                After the aforementioned discussion, we asked the students to leave their impressions on paper, either by doodling or by writing biology-related words and phrases, based on what caught their attention. The result is presented below. Surprisingly enough, when asked to draw bacteria, and while having no blueprints on how to do so or relevant images, the students let their imagination run wild, taking inspiration from the preceding discussion.

                            Judging from our own high-school experience, we observed a lack of engagement with the cutting-edge technological advancements, Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology included. Thus, we sought to include high school students in the discussions.
                        </P><P>
                            We presented in three different high schools over a two-week period in May 2018, in an audience of 10th and 11th graders. Our presentation entitled “Synthetic Biology: Engineering Life”, span from an analogy between living cells and machines, to biotechnology and the principles of synthetic biology and, finally, to our own iGEM project.

                                At the same time, a questionnaire was handed out with two sections, pre- and post-presentation. This way, we wished to observe how our presentation had engaged the students, gave birth to new questions and planted the seed of interest towards Synthetic Biology.

                                Some of the comments we received surprised our team. Many of those fall under the emotional engagement category, as students tried to process the new information in a sentimental way, while other remarks fall under the cognitive engagement category, as they used prior knowledge and their own logic to analyze the facts.

                            Apart from our overall presence in our respective university communities and the discussions we held from time to time with classmates, we wanted to take the discussion one step further. Thus, with the encouragement of <B>Dr. Kostas Vavitsas</B> and in collaboration with
                            <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Thessaloniki"><B>iGEM Thessaloniki</B></A>, we hosted a Synthetic Biology Workshop in our university, the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).
                        </P><DIV class="read-more-target"><P>
                                The workshop addressed university students of various backgrounds and specialties, as we sought to demonstrate that Synthetic Biology is an interdisciplinary field. The response to our call for participation was beyond any expectations and, in the end out of more than 50 applicants, 34 university students joined us on July 5th in NTUA.
                            </P><P>
                                The workshop was divided in 4 main sections. In the first section, the keynote speakers section, Dr. Kostas Vavitsas of Queensland University in Australia and <B>Prof. Fragiskos Kolissis</B> of NTUA presented and discussed with the audience on the topics of Synthetic and Systems Biology.
                            </P><P>
                                The second session was dedicated to greek iGEM teams. iGEM Greece 2017, iGEM Thessaloniki 2018 and our own team, iGEM Athens 2018 presented their projects and answered the audience’s questions.
                            </P><P>
                                The third session was the scientific and technical session, where we presented the principles of synthetic biology, as presented below in the SynBio Engineering Cycle and the SynBio Checklist (found on our <A href="#report">report</A>). The main point of this presentation was to give insight on the way of thinking and the top-down problem solving approach that is adopted when dealing with a SynBio project. On the same session, the basic tools of synthetic biology were presented, a table of which is presented on our <A href="#report">report</A>.
                            </P><P>
                                In the final session, an idea we shared and developed with iGEM Thessaloniki, students were divided into 7 teams of 4-6 members, selected a problem and attempted to tackle it using the tools of synthetic biology. The teams were provided the following 4 problems that they could choose from, including relevant information that would help them approach the issue:
                            </P><UL class="ul-hp-class1"><LI><DIV>

                                The teams were given a total time of 2:30 hours to process the problem, come up with prospective solutions using the tools of Synthetic Biology and sum them up in a 5-minute presentation. Our team members as well as iGEM Thessaloniki’s members had a mentoring role in the aforementioned session, assisting the teams, discussing with them and offering their feedback.
                            </P><P>
                                Of course, the time given was not sufficient to fully grasp the essence of a problem, research all the relevant aspects and propose a well-defined solution. However, this was done intentionally, as our team’s main goal was to introduce the principles of synthetic biology and trigger students into engaging with SynBio.
                            </P><P>
                                The teams’ presentations exceeded everyone’s expectations. Some of the teams chose to tackle problems of their own interest, for example the development of an “Anti-Doping test for athletes” or the creation of a product that would “detect whether pesticides were used on fruit and vegetables.” At the same time, other teams amazed us with the approach of the problem, their ideas and their suggested solutions.
                            </P><P>
                                During the presentations, four specialists in the field of Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology joined us in order to provide the teams with feedback. Among them was Dr. Kostas Vavitsas, <B>Prof. Georgios Skretas</B> of the National Hellenic Research Foundation, and <B>Dr. Pelli Foka</B> and <B>Dr. Timos Karamitros</B> of the Hellenic Pasteur Institute. Along with the four specialists-judges, the mentors and the audience engaged in a discussion regarding the teams’ proposals and the tools of Synthetic Biology.
                            </P><P>
                                Apart from successfully organizing and hosting the SynBio Workshop, our team must, and is proud to, note the creation of two new iGEM Teams for the 2019 Competition. Both those teams were created by university students that participated in our workshop. Naturally, we are elated to observe that our initiative sparked students’ interest in Synthetic Biology and led them to create their own iGEM teams.

More specifically, Dr. Dokopoulou guided us through the process of making an impactful presentation, suitable to high school audiences, as well as preparing questionnaires that are scientifically valid, with strong educational motives.

                                Summing up our Human Practices, we further discussed the possibility of introducing Synthetic Biology to the high school curriculum, a move that we deemed to be daring. This belief stems from observing the insufficiency in prerequisite biological knowledge at the secondary education level, as well as from the fact that biology is an exponentially developing scientific field. Both those facts, led us to support that Synthetic Biology could only be approached as part of thematic seminars, presentations, school projects or teams, whose main goal is to immerse high school students into the biological and biotechnological advancements.

                                Regarding the introduction of Synthetic Biology to the tertiary education, Prof. Haralampidis pointed out two fundamental needs: Firstly, the need to reinforce undergraduate programs’ curriculum with classes that are prerequisites for Synthetic Biology. Among others, he mentioned molecular and developmental biology, microbiology and genetics. Secondly, perceiving Synthetic Biology as an interdisciplinary field, Prof. Haralampidis indicated the need of collaboration between scientists and research fields.

                                Thus, he suggested the creation of a Graduate Program at the Biology Faculty in collaboration with the School of Chemical Engineering or the School of Mechanical Engineering that would address biologists, engineers, informaticians and medical students. It was pointed out that such a program in the undergraduate level would be “heavy and biased” towards students, who must first grasp the fundamentals of biology and engineering and comprehend their principles in depth before moving on to the interdisciplinary field of Synthetic Biology. Moreover, Prof. Haralampidis mentioned that this graduate program would be of great interest to greek students, as many young scientists immigrate to other countrie (U.S., U.K., Germany, The Netherlands, France) in order to pursue their passion for synthetic biology.

                                We then discussed the evolution of genetically modified plants, the misconceptions and the boundaries of human intervention. GMOs and GMO foods were a recurring theme in our Human Practices, as we presume it to be a sensitive topic in the greek society. Prof. Haralampidis declared that “we [humanity] would be hypocrites if we were to assume that we could survive without genetically modified organisms,” referring both to GM foods and plants as well as to the production of pharmaceutical drugs. However, as he mentioned, scientists strive to propose novel, more environmentally and consumer-friendly solution, than the existing ones. And of course, detailed knowledge of the organisms and their genome will prove to be a strong asset in humanity’s journey to developing more robust and safe engineered biological systems.

                                Prof. Fragkiskos Kolissis, by our team’s side since the beginning, found our intention of concluding our actions into a report most promising, suggesting its publication on the OMIC-Engine webpage, Greece’s newly established infrastructure for Synthetic Biology. He also suggested the creation of a video that would explain synthetic biology, addressing high school students. The link for the video can be found on the next session.

                    Explaining Synthetic Biology - A Linguistic Approach
                </H2><P>The following video was created as an introduction to Synthetic Biology for greek high school students. Thus, we adopted a simple approach to describe the principles of Synthetic Biology, by making an analogy with linguistics. Enjoy!</P><VIDEO width="900" height="520" controls=""><P>
