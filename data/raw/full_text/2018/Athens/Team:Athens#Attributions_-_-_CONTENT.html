                        Participating in the iGEM competition was an initiative that emerged in our initially small group of friends and colleagues at the School for Chemical Engineering, NTUA. Unfortunately, we do not have a synthetic biology course in our school's curriculum but we had heard about iGEM in online courses (&quot;Industrial Biotechnology&quot;, University of Manchester, on Coursera, &quot;The Principles of Synthetic Biology&quot;, MIT, on edX, “Genes and the Human Condition”, University of Maryland, on Coursera, materials freely available). We managed to find more students from different schools that shared the same passion for synthetic biology and finally started brainstorming around the beginning of December 2017. The first week of February we had decided on our project, the development of a method for Point-of-Care MERS-CoV diagnosis, and proceeded on reading tons of literature to specify the details. The laboratory training and experiments began at the end of May.
                    </P><P>
                        Throughout the last few months, we have achieved formulating a solid Proof of Concept, supported by dry lab experiments and validated by wet lab experiments. We are also in a position to propose a complete kit design based on the current needs for MERS-CoV POC diagnosis. Lastly, through our Human Practices efforts, we have introduced synthetic biology in several high school classrooms for the first time in Greece, and we have offered the opportunity of a short hands-on synbio project design experience to a group of undergraduate students.
                    </P><P>
                        None of the above would be possible without the assistance and support of our professors, supervisors, instructors, experts, and sponsors. We offer our sincerest thanks for their contribution.
                    </P></DIV><DIV id="the_team" class="athensSection"><H2>The team</H2><H3>Yannis Ntekas</H3><P>
                        Yannis as the team leader tried to supervise offering his help and insights in several different parts of the iGEM project. As a part of the dry lab team, he contributed in the toehold design and kinetic modelling. Alongside with Nelly, he set the basic lines and specifications for the kit design while he engaged in numerous discussions with professionals for the same reason.
                    </P><H3>Maria Litsa</H3><P>
                        Maria was the head of the wet lab team, therefore her main focus was designing, supervising and executing the experiments at the Molecular Virology Laboratory of the Hellenic Pasteur Institute. She was a link between wet and dry lab, bridging any knowledge gaps and assisting on modelling tasks. Maria devoted her very limited time outside the lab (as well as many nights’ worth of sleep) working on the team’s presentations, posters and graphics. Last but not least, she supported Leda in organising human practices activities.
                    </P><H3>Vasilis Krokos </H3><P>
                        Vasilis as the head of the dry-lab team, developed the code for determination of the most promising switches for in vitro testing, alongside Leda, Yannis and Stelios, including the training of the Neural Network. He also developed the 3D computational model for the design of the kit, carried out the simulations and interpreted the results, giving valuable feedback to Nelly and Yannis for the final design.
                    </P><H3>Leda Katopodi</H3><P>
                        Leda was a member of the Dry Lab team, alongside Yannis, Vasilis and Stelios, and performed the Molecular Dynamics Simulations under the auspices of the Cournia Lab at the Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens. While the simulations run, she devoted her time in organizing and carrying out the team’s Human Practices activities, giving emphasis on Education and Public Engagement. Moreover, she contributed aesthetically to the team by designing the project’s graphics, logos and banners.
                    </P><H3>Nelly Kanata</H3><P>
                        Nelly’s contribution included fundraising and financial management. She was also involved in the InterLab study, which she performed with Elena and Panos. Specifically, she contributed in the cell cultures, OD measurements, troubleshooting and documentation. As a part of the wetlab team, she worked as an assistant for a short period at Molecular Virology Laboratory in Hellenic Pasteur Institute. Finally, she designed and documented the proposed diagnostic kit and engaged in various Integrated Human Practices meetings.
                    </P><H3>Natalia Bartzoka</H3><P>
                        Natalia contributed to the project by handling some of the fundraising duties and by being part of the wetlab team. She dealt with the opening of the team’s university financial account and with the legal documents regarding sponsorships. She also handled, along with Nelly, the payment of the invoices regarding registration fees, air tickets and lab supplies. As part of the wetlab, she worked at Molecular Virology lab of the Hellenic Pasteur Institute on most of the laboratory techniques employed in the project. Lastly, she was involved in several Human Practices events.
                    </P><H3>Stelios Kotzastratis</H3><P>
                        Stelios' main contribution in the project was the production and maintenance of the team's web profile, excluding social media management. He designed the website that was deployed in the domain of the School of Chemical Engineering, NTUA, and subsequently, took on the creation of this Wiki page. On the side, Stelios dealt extensively with Image Editing, as well as occasionally helping in Dry Lab by troubleshooting with Linux-based tools that we initially used. Lastly, he embarked on some Android Development following our plans for accompanying our kit with a smartphone application; a concept that eventually didn't come into fruition due to time limitations.
                    </P><H3>Elena Kostadima</H3><P>
                        Elena’s contribution included initially participating in the InterLab Study. Later on, she participated in the wet lab experiments at both the National Technical University of Athens (School of Chemical Engineering) and the Hellenic Pasteur Institute, where she provided valuable help in bench work and troubleshooting. She was also responsible for the Social Media management and for the communication with other iGEM Teams for collaborations.

                        Panos’s mainly contributed to the InterLab Study, both participating in the experiments and securing access to the required instruments. He also provided general assistance concerning molecular biology, participated at the wet lab experiments that were carried out at the National Technical University of Athens and contributed in creating the protein models that were afterwards used for the molecular dynamics simulations.
