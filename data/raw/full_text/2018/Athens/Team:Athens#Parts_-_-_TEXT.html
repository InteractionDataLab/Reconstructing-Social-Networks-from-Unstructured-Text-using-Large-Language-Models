The Toehold Switch
TBS: Trigger Binding Site, a 30 nucleotides long sequence, reverse complementary to the target RNA. Target RNA, a conserved MERS-CoV genome sequence, will be attracted and finally bind to it.
RBS: Ribosome Binding Site, a 12 nucleotides long sequence, responsible for the recruitment of a ribosome during the initiation of protein translation.
ATG: Start codon
TS Linker: The toehold switch linker is a 21 nucleotides long sequence, connecting the reporter protein to rest of the toehold, ensuring minimum interaction between the two.
The reporter protein
Zipper: Leucine zipper to assemble the a-part of the split trehalase with the b-part.
Zipper linker: The zipper linker is a 18 nucleotides long sequence that attaches the leucine zipper to the split trehalase.
G: Forward spacer in order to keep trehalase in frame.
TreA-a: The first part of the split trehalase, of 66 amino acids.
