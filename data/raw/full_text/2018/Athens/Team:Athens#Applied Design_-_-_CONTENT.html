                        As of this August, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the US has declared MERS in the Arabian Peninsula as an Alert Level 2 virus. This means that travelers are advised to take enhanced precautions in order to avoid potentially spreading the virus. In our effort to strengthen the response provisions in case of an outbreak, we propose GENOMERS, a MERS-CoV Detection Kit design that could be used in Point-of-Care (POC) and emergency testing facilities. In order to successfully satisfy the needs that occur in such facilities our kit should enclose certain characteristics. We have identified and listed these characteristics into three categories according to their importance: the ones that are critical, the ones that are desirable and those that are useful. Following this prioritization, we managed to implement in our design all of the critical and several of the desirable and useful characteristics.
                    </P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Image 1</B>: Needs in POC and Field Diagnostics.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>
                        In conclusion, this diagnostic kit meets the key requirements for use in emergency situations where rapid mass testing is needed, from busy airports around the world to low-resource healthcare facilities in remote villages. Since its operation does not require specially educated personnel nor complex laboratory equipment, the test could be performed by any nurse, assisting staff or volunteer that has received a short training.
                    </P><P>
                        The proposed kit design is a product of an open dialogue with experts, as well as with the society. Our ultimate goal was to keep our project aligned to the real societal needs around MERS-CoV detection and rapid containment during a potential outbreak.

                        Our design flow follows a top-down approach, where the overall system is depicted to consist of distinct, consecutive tasks. First of all, we describe some general characteristics of the overall system, as mentioned above, and then we continue on specifying the needs of the separate sub-systems. These needs formulate the main driving force for the design process to be followed.

                                The extraction buffers and the amplification reagents will be encapsulated in polymer bubbles that will break with a plastic needle that slides alongside the second layer.

                                The detection reaction occurs on Paper Disc B. This disc carries the freeze-dried cell-free transcription-translation system with the DNA circuit, as well as excess trehalose. [4] Transcription of the circuit begins upon rehydration of the disc, producing toehold regulated trehalase genes. When the trigger RNA is present, the enzyme trehalase is produced. In the right pH conditions, trehalase hydrolyzes the existing trehalose to glucose, whose levels are then measured with a glucometer.

                                The hydrophobic barrier is a thin film that keeps the two paper discs separated so that reactions can run on both of them in parallel, without interference. [5] The one end of the film is stuck on the front side of the device so that the film falls behind after a certain step of layer two's sliding, allowing direct contact of the two paper discs. This happens at the end of the RNA amplification on Paper Disc A, where the amplified sample must wick to Paper Disc B for the detection reaction to occur.

                                The kit is designed to detect the virus with an initial viral load down to 10<SUP>4</SUP> copies/mL in the sample. In order for the device to be sensitive, the viral RNA should be amplified, raising the trigger RNA sequence concentration levels. We chose to implement RPA (Recombinase Polymerase Amplification), an isothermal amplification method that operates between 37-42<SUP>o</SUP>C. This temperature range is favorable as the freeze-dried cell-free protein expression system works best at 37<SUP>o</SUP>C. Besides, this method delivers a number of copies comparable to PCR in less than 30 minutes. <SUP>[6]</SUP> Briefly, RPA reagents are freeze-dried on paper Disc A, to extend the shelf life of the kit in areas where refrigeration is inaccessible. The blister containing the RPA buffers breaks, the disc absorbs them and amplification occurs.

                                The isothermal amplification method, as well as the cell-free transcription-translation system, require a constant temperature. Both subsystems, as defined, function optimally in 37<SUP>o</SUP>C, therefore we propose the use of a self-regulating PTC thermistor as a heater. Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) thermistors are resistors whose resistance increases with temperature. Coupling this with an aluminum sheet to spread the heat and an insulating material to surround the kit, we expect a uniform temperature profile, that would need minimum power to maintain. The heating element and the power source, two small 3.7V batteries, are a cost-effective, portable and reusable solution.

                        More specifically, it is a positive control that gives the maximum value of glucose levels in the final solution. The control is similar to the detection assay, except that the riboswitches are triggered by human RNA found in the parapharyngeal sample. This way, the detected glucose levels indicate if anything during the process does not follow the designed path. If the output value is not within the expected range but significantly lower, a false negative signal is identified.

                        Given the nature and the aim of our test, that is a tool for mass testing for a first immediate diagnosis, we concluded that a negative control would add complexity to our device rather than provide useful information. Avoiding a false positive would, of course, be desirable, however, for safety reasons, all signals positive to MERS-CoV diagnosis should be further tested by the conventional laboratory assays. In addition, a binary test is widely considered more user-friendly than one demanding three measurements and the subsequent comparisons.

                        The output signal is a glucose concentration in mg/dL or mmol/L, as the most common glucometers display. The test operator will give a yes or no answer to the patient according to the threshold value. If the positive control value is higher than expected, the measurement is considered invalid.
                    </P><P>
                        We have chosen to use the existing glucose monitoring technology as it is an already robust and optimised measurement method. In addition, glucose meters are very common and low-cost equipment, broadly available in Point-of-Care facilities. The glucometer should be calibrated when switching from blood sample to processed pharyngeal sample, so as to avoid inaccurate measurement. A simple glucose aquatic solution is used for the calibration before the MERS-CoV diagnostic assay. Before reusing the glucometer for blood testing, it should be calibrated with a commercial control solution. Also glucometers should be sanitized after each use.
                    </P><P>
                        The detection system coupled with the glucose monitoring device is a semi-quantitative method as it could give an approximate indication of the viral load in the sample. For this to be reliable, we should make a series of experiments with clinical samples and calculate the correction factors and establish the error ranges.

                        Safety has been a key factor throughout the designing of our kit. We are confident that we propose a complete design that does not sacrifice health and environmental quality over usability and cost.
                    </P><P>
                        More specifically, the kit consists of a detachable, disposable part and a reusable and recyclable one.
                    </P><P>
                        The first two layers of the kit come in contact with the infected sample, consequently bearing a high risk of carryover contamination if improperly handled. For this reason, they are considered biohazardous and should be discarded accordingly to local regulations. Therefore, the two upper layers will be detached and discarded in a disposal bag with a “biohazard” sign that will be provided with the kit along with detailed instructions, as suggested by World Health Organization.
                    </P><P>
                        The lower layer, containing the heater and the power source, will be reusable. This would reduce the cost per assay in Point of Care facilities, where one heating base will be used for multiple runs. The kit will include instructions on proper disposal of electronic waste.

                        As of now there are two categories of detection methods for MERS-CoV. The first category is molecular tests, that can detect active infections. The second category is serology tests that detect antibodies to MERS-CoV, therefore indicating that the patient has been infected in the past. For this reason they are only suitable for surveillance and research purposes, not for diagnostic ones.
                    </P><P>
                        The proposed toehold switch mechanism that we employ in our kit belongs to the molecular methods. The table below is is an attempt to compare the proposed diagnostic kit to rRT-PCR, the main alternative molecular method for MERS-CoV detection.

                        The proposed design has been developed incorporating feedback from a number of experts and always considering the general safety. However, we could not but underline certain aspects that could lead to negative implications.
                    </P><P>
                        Firstly, we should take into account the risk of the virus transmitting to those that operate the test, whether they are professionals or volunteers, and make sure to educate them properly on keeping safety measures. Since part of the kit is reusable, it should be sanitized after each use. The same applies to the glucometer that should be disinfected according to the ISO 15197:2013, as recommended by the FDA. This procedure involves cleaning the glucometer with germicidal wipes for one minute and allowing it to dry at room temperature. In addition, the disposable part of the kit should be discarded according to the local policies. However, we are concerned that in some areas the biohazard disposal policies might be more loose due to lack of education or resources.
                    </P><P>
                        On the other hand, the diagnostic test alone is not sufficient for containing a virus outbreak. We are worried that, perhaps, some patients will not proceed to visiting a doctor and follow the suggested procedures. For this reason, the emergency testing facilities should be in direct contact with hospitals to facilitate and encourage patients to comply with safety rules.
                    </P><P>                  Finally, we are concerned over the psychological factor of delivering the MERS-CoV diagnosis. The personnel’s training should involve instructions on how to announce the diagnosis, informing the patients on the next steps without panicking them. This is important especially as the diagnostic method does not contain a negative control for simplicity and cost reasons, thus a false positive cannot be detected.
