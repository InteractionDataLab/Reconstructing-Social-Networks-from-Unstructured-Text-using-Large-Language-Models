Over the summer, our teams noticed the similar topics of our projects and decided collaboration would be a great idea. One of our team members happened to have an internship in Omaha, NE and got the chance to meet with UNL's team in Lincoln. They discussed project progress, our teams, and spoke about plans to collaborate. We settled on making an informative brochure on emerald ash borers and their potential impact on the U.S. based on our collective multiple industry contacts. Copies of this brochure will be available at our poster session and is attached below. </P></SECTION><SECTION id="Attributions" style="padding-bottom:25px; padding-left:35px;"><DIV class="col-lg-12 text-center"><H2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Brochure</H2><H3 class="section-subheading text-muted">UNL iGEM</H3></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="bg-light" id="Attributions" style="padding-bottom:25px; padding-left:35px;"><DIV class="col-lg-12 text-center"><H2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Correspondance with UNL iGEM</H2><H3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Questions we collectively asked our industry experts and academia experts</H3></DIV><DIV class="col-lg-12 text-center"><H3 class="section-heading text-uppercase"> Description of your project including the benefits and drawbacks</H3></DIV><P>Our proposed long term solution to the devastation of EABs is to develop a Ash
tree that is genetically resistant to them. We would do this with a known Bacillus
thuringiensis Cry8Da protein, by inducing mutation in the protein’s receptor
binding regions to create a Bt toxin specific for EABs. After screening these
modified proteins, we would utilize leaf-specific expression of the Cry toxin, in
order to target the EABs as they feed during adulthood.</P><P>The benefit of this project would be that the ideal urban landscaping ash tree
could still be used, just with this implementation of genetic engineering. The
drawbacks of the project are that it is a very long-term solution, and does not
have the effective nature of a new treatment method.</P><DIV class="col-lg-12 text-center"><H3 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Current treatments/other work: </H3><H3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Cutting down trees, pesticide options, predatory wasps, grading resistant ash trees, benefits, and drawbacks to these</H3></DIV><P> The main current treatments in place are: soil drenching, injecting insecticides
into the soil, grafting of resistant ash trees, and parasitic wasps. The arborists our
team interviewed prefered the injection of emamectin benzoate, as it has minimal
impact on surroundings, as compared to soil drenching or spraying of
insecticides. Removing trees altogether, though it is an option, can be expensive
and difficult in urban environments. Another option is to integrate resistant ash
tree cuttings onto normal ash trees in nurseries, as this cloning is how most
urban nurseries produce trees anyways (rather than growing through seed).
Predatory wasps would work most effectively in forested ash populations, as the
trees are more clustered, and there is a larger gradient between the separate
populations of ash.</P><DIV class="col-lg-12 text-center"><H3 class="section-heading text-uppercase"> What is the monetary impact of EABs in Missouri?</H3></DIV><P> Ash trees are one of the most common types of trees used in urban
environments. For example, in some parks and neighborhoods, up to 40% of all
intentionally planted trees are some sort of Ash. This significant lack of species
diversity means that the destructive effects of EAB will be magnified, as will the
cost of dealing with it. Here in Missouri, cities have been using estimates from
more greatly affected states to prepare budgets in preparation for the arrival of
EAB. Considering the average cost of over $1 million in some Ohio communities,
the city of Chesterfield budgeted $2.2 million for Ash tree removal and
replacement alone back in 2012. Meanwhile, the city of Brentwood estimated
their costs would be just over $500,000, with an average cost of approximately
$65 per resident. Little information has been collected on the impact of EAB on
Missouri’s logging industry, however, over 15,000 units of Ash lumber were
harvested and sold in 2017 according to the Missouri Department of
Conservation. </P></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
