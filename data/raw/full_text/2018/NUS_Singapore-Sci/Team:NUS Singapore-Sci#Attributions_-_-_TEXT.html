Team Members of NUS Singapore-Science
Jessie Wong Ling Ai was the team leader who oversaw all subprojects carried out and organized meetings between subgroups. She worked on the RESCUE editor system. In addition, she helped with outreach, human practices and marketing for the RESCUE system.
Fong Yuhui Deborah was the co-team leader in charge of the wet lab section, and was the main correspondent and coordinator for our Interlab studies. She was in charge of the design and experiment of the RESCUE editor system.
Kim Mu Young was in charge of the coding of our wiki and one of the co-team leader coordinating the administrative aspect for the team.
Cheng Li Yi worked on the design and construction of the RESCUE reporter system, and was also in charge for sourcing for sponsors and marketing.
Tan Li Yang was in charge of the modelling component for RESCUE and was part of the marketing team. He was also involved in design and experiments for the RESCUE editor system.
Sabrina Chua Yah Tse worked on design and construction of the RESCUE reporter system, and was part of the human practices’ team.
Wong Po Yee, Tricia was in charge of human practices and the outreach for the RESCUE system.
Chia Biing Hann worked on the RESCUE modelling and helped out with the coding of the wiki.
He Menglan was in charge of the design, construction and characterization of the RESCUE reporter system. She also helped with the characterization of the RESCUE editor system and outreach programme.
Mavis Loberas worked on the RESCUE editor system and was in charge of the illustration and graphics for the entire project.
Ravichandran Divyapoorani worked on the construction and characterization RESCUE reporter system. She also helped with the characterization of the RESCUE editor system as well as outreach programme.
