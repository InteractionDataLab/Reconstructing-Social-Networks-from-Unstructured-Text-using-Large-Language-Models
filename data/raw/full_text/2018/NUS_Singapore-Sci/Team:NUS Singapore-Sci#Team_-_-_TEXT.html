NUS Singapore Science: About Us!
Introducing
the Team
Hailing from the city-nation of Singapore, we are a group of 11 undergraduate students from the Special Programme in Science, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore!
The
Students
"Love the life you live, live the life you love."
- Bob Marley
Cheng Li Yi
Hi! I'm Li Yi, a Life Sciences major that is trying to explore the vast fields of Biology. Apart from doing laboratory work, being able to communicate Science to those not in the field and spark their interest in your project also excites me. Hence, in this iGEM team, I am involved in marketing and human practice. We hope that our project can have an impact on the society!

Mavis Loberas
Hi! I'm Mavis, a final year Life Science undergraduate. I love dogs, playing video games, and I find science pretty cool too. My main scientific interests are in neuroscience, mechanobiology, and genetic engineering! I'm part of the wet lab team, and have also designed our team's mascot.
"The reality is either you step into the future, or you become a dinosaur."

Deborah Yuhui Fong
Hello! My name is Deborah, and I am a Year 2 Life Sciences student in NUS! I think it is really amazing how nature works – how things can come together so naturally to carry out functions for the cell to work. I really like appreciating nature both on the macro and micro scale (hence my major). Aside from that, I like spending time with friends just chilling or eating good food ^^.
"To seek joy in the saddest places. To pursue beauty to its lair. To never simplify what is complicated or complicate what is simple."
-Arundhati Roy
Sabrina Chua
I am a life sciences student that likes new experiences. Biology has always been fascinating to me and I really enjoy lab! iGEM is a new and challenging opportunity where I get to do a project that is majority student led and there are just so many things to learn from this project and the people around me!  In my free time, I like taking the train and stopping at random train stations to explore the area around it.
"Failure is the mother of success."

He Menglan
Hi I am Menglan, a Year 4 undergraduate student major in Life science. I am working in wet lab team for IGEM this year.
"It's now or never"

Jessie Wong
Hi I'm Jessie, a year 3 life science undergraduate trying to live the life of a scientist and an entrepreneur.
"Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire."
- Jennifer Lee
Ravichandran Divyapoorani
I am Divyapoorani, a Year 3 Life Sciences major with a specialisation in Biomedical Science. My research interests lie in translational medicine specifically in oncology and cell signalling pathways. Some of my hobbies include Indian Classical dance (Bharatanatyam), listening to music and singing!
"I've got a formula for that, but well, it only works for a spherical cell in a vacuum."
-Anonymous
Chia Biing Han
I'm a Physics major studying in NUS;
I have a whole lot of interest in math, physics, or even computing in general;
Nice to meet you, hopefully!;

Tricia Wong
Lives the owl lifestyle, collects anything about bears, watches too many concerts & overdoses on Japanese food.

Kim Mu Young
Just a passer-by who got involved trying to learn something new and somewhat partially succeeding.
The
Mentors
Nguyen Hoang Diem Phuong
I’m graduated with Bachelor of Science in Life Sciences. My main research interest is on cancer immunotherapy, but I am always eager to explore other exciting areas. I participated in iGEM as a mentor of Team NUS_Singapore 2016.
Ang Shi Hui
Hello! I'm Shi Hui! I've recently graduated with a degree in Life Sciences, and have previously joined iGEM in 2016. I'm personally interested in therapeutics related to human diseases, and in my spare time, I like to play games :).

Wong Chi Yan
Chi Yan is currently working as a Research Officer at the A*STAR Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, where she investigates the use of circulating biomarkers for molecular diagnostics. She participated in iGEM 2015 (SPSingapore) and iGEM 2016 (NUS_Singapore), and has returned to share her knowledge and experience with her juniors. Outside of the lab, she enjoys travelling and building all sorts of puzzles.
"If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you."
- Friedrich Nietzsche
Joseph Chan Man Yau
Hi there! I am a Ph.D. student in Meteorology at Penn State. My main specialization is about inferring unobserved  atmospheric variables through observed variables using data assimilation. Since data assimilation methods can be applied to anything with hidden variables, I am trying them out on synthetic biology!
