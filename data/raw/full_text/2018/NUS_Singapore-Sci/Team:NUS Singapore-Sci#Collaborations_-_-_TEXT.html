Host of iGEM Singapore 2018 Meet Up
Picture: Teams from NUS Singapore-Sci, NUS Singapore-A and NTU-Singapore gathering for a photo session over a pizza break in the SPS lounge (June 2018).
While both the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have sent multiple teams to participate in iGEM over the years, most of the interactions have been informal and ad hoc. For the first time in 2018, Singapore has three iGEM teams participating in this year's competition. The three teams that will be representing Singapore this year are: NTU-Singapore, NUS Singapore-A (NUSGEM) and the last being ourselves.
As part of the networking and to foster collaboration, the NUS Singapore-Science iGEM team initiated and hosted an iGEM Singapore 2018 meet-up on June 2018. We invited the teams NUSGEM and NTU-Singapore to come over and mingle with our team over light refreshment. After some friendly chat over pizza kindly provided by NUSGEM, we got down to a serious discussion during which we discussed about our projects and possible areas of collaboration in human practices, modelling as well as wet lab. While the vastly different projects we have committed ourselves to made modelling and wet lab collaborations difficult, some possible collaborations were suggested in the human practices side.
All in all, this iGEM Singapore meet-up allowed all of us to get a sense of what the other teams' projects were about, and have a fruitful discussion on areas where we could help each other. We hope to continue this meet-up over the following years, as we expect more and more teams to represent Singapore in iGEM.
Translations Collaboration
We also helped multiple teams with translating their Human Practice documents and videos to other languages to further help their outreach. Below are the teams we collaborated with.
Team Washington
Team Washington produced a booklet which taught the basics of synthetic biology to those not familiar in the area. Among the topics they presented was on the CRISPR-Cas system, which we found relevant to our project. We provided the Vietnamese translation for the above-mentioned section.
Team IIT-Madras
Team IIT-Madras produced a series of videos explaining the basics of cellular systems. We helped translate and record the Korean version of one of their videos.
Human Practices Collaboration
We also collaborated with Team EPFL on a comparative study between the legislative frameworks for genetic engineering in our countries, Switzerland and Singapore. Thus, we did an analysis on the similarities and differences and how these can be accounted to context differences. Head over to #CasWrites to read up our analysis!
