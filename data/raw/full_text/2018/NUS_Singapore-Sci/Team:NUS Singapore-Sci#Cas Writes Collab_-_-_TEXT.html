NUS Singapore Science: InterLab
As part of #CasWrites, we wanted to provide a literature review on the legislation present in Singapore that shapes the direction of gene manipulation research. To make things more exciting, we did this in a form of a collaboration with the iGEM École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) 2018 team! Our collaboration was a comparative study to highlight similarities and differences between the existing guidelines related to genetic engineering in the two countries. We identified several important areas - use, research, distribution of genetically modified (GM)-related products and the frameworks to mitigate risk and manage data. By analyzing the differing administrative structure and population, we gained valuable insight about how legislation can be contextualized. This discussion and exchange of ideas was extremely interesting and fruitful. We are glad to have the opportunity to embark on this collaboration!
