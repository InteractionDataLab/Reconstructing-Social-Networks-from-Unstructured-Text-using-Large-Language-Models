NUS Singapore Science: #CasTeaches
Public
Engagement
Through surveying the public ( #CasAsks: Survey ), we learnt about common misconceptions and knowledge gaps regarding genetic engineering among Singaporeans. Recognizing the need for enhanced scientific literacy, we decided to better inform the public via videos ( #CasTalks ), breaking down complex scientific concepts to bite-sized information and debunking common misconceptions. Through this video series, we present a diversity of perspectives -  from the applications and potential of genetic engineering to its risks and ethical concerns. This encourages members of the public to adopt a more informed stance, and further engage with government bodies to navigate the ethics with the advancement of science. Furthermore, students need to be cognizant to such prevailing technologies that will be of increasing relevance to them in the future as such technology develops and matures. Thus, we carried out a series of outreach talks ( #CasTeaches ) with the aim of garnishing their education with the science of genome editing and their potential in therapeutics and diagnostics. We also stimulated their critical thinking by introducing the ethical conundrums surrounding genetic engineering. At the same time, not neglecting expert opinion, our team interviewed molecular biologists and bioethicists who offered their views on the potential and obstacles of genome editing ( #CasAsks: Interview ).
Our team believes that public engagement is a two-way process. The scientists in the field are the producers of such technologies, the public are the eventual consumers and the regulatory boards are the mediators. Dialogue between these key stakeholders are therefore important and critical to ensure healthy progress of the biomedical research scene. We hope to do our small part in this big topic of genome editing, be an agent through our aforementioned efforts to bring expert scientists and the general public closer. This will set the scene for more engaging and active discussions on genome editing techniques within our society.
