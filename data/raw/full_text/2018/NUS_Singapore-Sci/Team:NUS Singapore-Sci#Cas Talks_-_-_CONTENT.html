We have identified the public to be our greatest stakeholder, as they would probably be the biggest group that would eventually consume the technology. This segment of our human practices is directed to the general public, which complements <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:NUS_Singapore-Sci/Cas_Teaches" style="text-decoration:none;font-weight:normal;">#CasTeaches</A>, a series of informal lectures given to students. 
 
We will take our audience through a journey, starting from understanding the scientific basis of genetic editing. Our teaser video parallels a simple analogy to DNA editing and posts ambiguity on how DNA editing may post as a potential treatment but yet not widely used in therapy. Engaging the public on some of their thoughts on genome editing aided us in establishing some misconceptions people have on genome editing that we felt were important to address. To do so, we have sourced out professionals in the field to debunk the top four misconceptions to provide a clearer picture in the field of genome editing for the public. 
 
Further into the journey, we want to dispel misunderstanding about certain scientific terms. Through our survey responses in #CasAsks, we realised that some respondents perceived genome editing as a means for genetic enhancement and, unrealistic enhancements at that. Thus, we asked the professionals for an explanation of genetic enhancement and the potential for genetic enhancement to enable ‘designer babies’. Our team recognised the danger in dabbling on the genetic material that will eventually be passed down to future generations, which helped us veer towards a more temporary solution to editing: RNA editing. 
 
At last, we wish to engage the audience at a personal level, by introducing them to ethical issues involved in genetic manipulation technology and encouraging them to adopt a personal stance for the ethics behind the scientific concepts introduced previously.

Episode 1 - What is gene editing?
</DIV><DIV class="text">
We have seen complicated videos on DNA editing. Did we understand them? Maybe. DNA editing has many benefits but why is it not commonly used in therapeutics now? Our group simplifies what is DNA editing and the issues that come with this useful technique.

Episode 2 - Myths &amp; Misconceptions Part 1 
</DIV><DIV class="text">
You may have heard of genome editing and genetic engineering. But do you really know genome editing? Our videos touch on two out of four commonly mistaken myths and misconceptions we found in a survey conducted on people in Singapore. Listen to what our experts have to say about it!

Episode 3 - Myths &amp; Misconceptions Part 2 
</DIV><DIV class="text">
We have seen two myths and misconceptions of genome editing in our previous video. Do you think it’s true that the introduction of genetic material can enhance physical characteristics? Watch to find out.

Episode 4 - Genetic Enhancement 
</DIV><DIV class="text">
Many of us know that gene editing can help make changes to our genetic information. Some people think genetic enhancement is possible to improve future generations. Do you think we can make our babies smarter with genetic engineering? Lets see what our experts say.

Episode 5 - What is DNA/RNA Editing?
</DIV><DIV class="text">
Now that we know more about genetic editing, today we’ll discuss 2 sub-branches of gene editing: DNA and RNA editing.

Episode 6 - Ethical Issues of Genetic Editing
</DIV><DIV class="text">
We know that DNA and RNA editing are very powerful techniques to help alter genetic sequences,  but there must be rules that govern rights and safety in research. We have our expert Dr. Calvin Ho and Dr. Kon Oi Lian to tell us more about possible ethical issues that comes with genome editing.
