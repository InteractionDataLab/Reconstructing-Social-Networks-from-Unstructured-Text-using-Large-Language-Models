Composite Parts
Described below are the composite parts we have designed in our project.
SgrS
RybB
RprA
OmrB
For each of the above sRNAs we created two types of composite parts: Each of our sRNAs targeted both a GFP construct with a weak promotor (BBa_I20270) and a strong promoter (BBa_J36400).
And so our composite parts consisted of a LacI promotor, a TBS complementary to the target mRNA to be repressed (with strong/weak promoter), and our sRNA scaffold (containing a rho-independent terminator and a Hfq-binding site)
Submission to iGEM HQ:
As the composite parts our team have engineered in the lab only target GFP expression, we have chosen not to submit these to iGEM HQ, as we do not think these would be of particular use to other teams. Our main aim was to demonstrate that our sRNA scaffold can be used in various composite parts rather than show it as an example of a composite part itself.
