  With the philosophy of “Think Global, Act Local”, I see iGEM as an opportunity to add value to the community around us. My hope is that both our university and other iGEM teams help us establish a platform where students can express their motivation, talent and curiosity for science. </P></FIGURE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="rightperson" id="maria"><DIV class="leftdesc" id="mariadesc"><DIV class="name">

I believe in the promise that synthetic biology will allow us to go beyond our limits with responsibility… and I believe that hundreds of contributions each year from iGEMers are the driving force behind it.
    As a student interested in the field of Genetics I am honoured to be part of this and make a contribution that helps to push this step further. </P></FIGURE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="leftperson" id="kat"><DIV class="leftdesc" id="katdesc"><DIV class="name">

      Being part of KCL iGEM allows me to work with incredible people. My goal is to help change the perception of synthetic biology outside the scientific community with the hopes to raise awareness of its beneficial potential and ability to transform the world around us.</P></FIGURE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="rightperson" id="joao"><DIV class="rightdesc" id="joaodesc"><DIV class="name">

        My goal for iGEM is helping to create a safe and diverse work environment. Also, I think it's super important for us to try and increase diversity in STEM through teaching and working with different communities!</P></FIGURE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="rightperson" id="deeksha"><DIV class="leftdesc" id="deekshadesc"><DIV class="name">

When I'm not at uni I'm raising two amazing kids, which leaves a bit of time for my other interests which are cooking, travel, reading and going for long walks in the great outdoors.
I wanted to join the iGEM team to make the world that little bit better via the application of synthetic biology.</P></FIGURE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="rightperson" id="ella"><DIV class="rightdesc" id="elladesc"><DIV class="name">

I have decided to work on the marketing and sponsorship side of iGEM in order to push myself to learn more about the business side of science whilst gaining interpersonal skills and hopefully being able to put my languages to use.

Being part of the first KCL iGEM team is an honour but also a challenge, but seeing the motivation and ambition of our team I’m sure we will succeed!</P></FIGURE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="leftperson" id="lux"><DIV class="rightdesc" id="luxdesc"><DIV class="name">

Originally I come from Lithuania but before coming to London I spent two years in Italy. This has led me to take on learning quite a few languages on my own, like English, Spanish, Russian and Italian.

Apart from testing my own abilities, my goal for iGEM is to show that science is becoming more inclusive and progressive. With technology improving this fast, we can do anything!</P></FIGURE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="rightperson" id="josephine"><DIV class="leftdesc" id="josephinedesc"><DIV class="name">
