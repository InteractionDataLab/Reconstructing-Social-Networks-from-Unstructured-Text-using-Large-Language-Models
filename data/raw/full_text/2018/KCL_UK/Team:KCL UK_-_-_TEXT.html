What Have We Done?
Our team have engineered a library of sRNA scaffolds that have the potential to be used as a tool in the understanding of sRNA functions such as regulation of protein expression. Our project is based on a “Proof of Concept” principle and we have used E.coli K12 to test this. Regulation of gene expression has been quantitively assessed through GFP signalling. We have chosen to focus on sRNAs that target the 3’ UTR of mRNA. We hope that future scientists will be able to use our novel tool as a way to use sRNAs to tackle issues involving sRNA interactions such as antibiotic resistance.
