Parts
The HZAU-China team also participated in the InterLab project as we did                 in the past years. At                 first we read and analyzed the protocol provided by the headquarters carefully, then we checked out if                 we had                 all the essential material and equipment. After everything was well prepared, we formally carried                 out the experiment.
Calibration
OD600 Reference Point
To obtain the OD600 reference point of a particular plate reader is rather necessary since we can                     only obtain ABS from a plate reader which is different from OD gained from a spectrophotometer. The                     ABS data obtained from a plate reader is volume-dependent while the sample of a spectrophotometer                     are volume-fixed.
As the protocol instructed, we added 100μL LUDOX solution into wells A1, B1, C1, D1 while added                     100μL ddH2O into wells A2, B2, C2, D2. Then, we measured OD600 of the samples in the                     plate reader                     (Table 1).

Particle Standard Curve
The particle standard curve experiment aims to obtain the relationship curve between the ABS600 of                     the solution and the concentration of bacteria. To achieve this goal, we need to find a kind of                     material which resembles bacteria very much. The headquarters sent us with Silica Beads, a kind of                     little                     particle which met our needs.
We made up a series of solution of different but continuous magnitude. To make the experiment more                     precise, we also set up another three parallel groups (Figure 1).

Fluorescence Standard Curve
The fluorescence standard curve experiment targets to obtain the relationship curve between the                     strength of fluorescence and the concentration of fluorescein which has similar excitation and                     emission properties to GFP.
We prepared a series of fluorescein solution of different but continuous magnitude. As every                     experiment required, we also set up 4 parallel groups. Then we measured the strength of the                     fluorescence of each sample (Figure 2).

Cell Measurement
Cell measurement was the most complicated experiment we've ever countered in the whole InterLab. It                     nearly took us a whole week to complete and diagnose the data. Each step of the experiment was so                     crucial that it could impact the result to a detectable extent.
However, we fixed up all the mistakes and completed the experiment satisfactorily (Table 2).

After repeated experiments we chose the best data and upload them to headquarters.
Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E. coli cultures
The CFU experiment is another challenging mission for its large amount of work and complicated                     operations.
We diluted the bacteria solution to OD600 = 0.1, then made up a sort of magnitude as the protocol                     required.
After reconducting the experiment for three times, we successfully achieved the data required by                     headquarters                     and finished the InterLab satisfactorily (Table 3).

aTMTC in our forms means the colony forming units in this plate is too much to                     count (over 300).
Summary
With this, we are delighted to announce that we completed the work on punctual with satisfaction                     from Measurement Committee.
The only suggestion we want to submit is that, in the Cell Measurement                     Experiment, we don’t think                     it’s correct to put the sample at 0 hour on ice. Because even if you put it on ice, the bacteria                     will also definitely grow, which results in high systematical error in the experiment.
