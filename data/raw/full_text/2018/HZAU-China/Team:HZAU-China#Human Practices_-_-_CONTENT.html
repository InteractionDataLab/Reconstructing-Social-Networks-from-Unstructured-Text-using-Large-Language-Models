                    with no danger of defeat”. In the battle with cancer, we have gained great knowledge about the
                    “enemy”, as well as our own immune system. However, despite the success in curing early and middle
                    stage cancers we have made, the lack of public comprehension is still likely to cause panic. We
                    sensed that our mission is to help the public learn more about cancer and its treatment, as well as
                    the difference that synthetic biology can make in future approach. To accomplish that, we held a
                    live seminar to share our idea and then started to blog newly emerged cancer therapies, basic
                    aspects of synthetic biology and our project. Meanwhile, letting the public know that their voices
                    have been heard is also very important, so we collected their opinions carefully through public
                    survey, designed new circuits for their safety concerns, and invited them for discussion on our
                    team blog. To explore the further application and the potential risk, we also communicated with
                    some cancer experts. We want to be a communicating bridge during this battle where information is
                    accessible to everyone who needs it.</P></DIV><DIV id="float02"><DIV class="h1">Silver Human Practice</DIV><DIV class="h2"><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/Safety">Safety</A></DIV><P>This year, we have done a lot of work in order to meet the requirement of biosafety.

                                microbes, he points out that <I>Salmonella</I> is a kind of safe bacterium which is
                                widely
                                used in
                                researches around the world. After knocking out a series of genes, the harm of

                                is

                                overview of tumor treatments. When asked about what the most used therapy at present
                                is,

                                spirits. Even if we could complete the project, we still need an enormous amount of

                    the use of bacteria to treat cancer. We thought people's scruple is largely because they know
                    little about bacterial therapy and synthetic biology. So, we not only set up a blog for
                    popularizing science about synthetic biology and our project, but also gave lectures to freshmen in
                    our university about our work to get more feedback. Through above activities, we expanded the scope
                    of our survey. By making people more aware of synthetic biology and bacterial therapy, they became
                    more receptive to our project. In the survey results and discussion on our blog, we realized that
                    more knowledge can significantly reduce peoples’ worries. During our education engagement, we also
                    had more safety thinking and better performance in our experimental design.</P></DIV><DIV id="float03"><DIV class="h1">Integrated Human Practice</DIV><P>Pyroptosis therapy, as a new approach derived from cell natural defense mechanism, can bring
                    positive
                    effects to human health with our rightful use. We all know that one day synthetic biologists will
                    develop
                    artificial life forms as vehicles. At that point, pyroptosis carried out by these excellent tools
                    will
                    release its enormous potential, work just like the nanorobots in science fiction movies, leaving
                    cancer cells
                    nowhere to hide. Within the right hands, it can provide us with new opportunities of making the
                    world a
                    better place. </P><P>For a new treatment, a person or institution cannot represent all human beings to define it.
                    Therefore, our integrated human practice aims to hear voices from both experts and the public, in
                    order to analyze and improve our project. At the beginning, we participated in two conference
                    meetings in mainland China, and had an in-depth communication with the teams who had conducted the
                    tumor treatment related projects like us. Then, we consulted several experts from Hubei Cancer
                    Hospital and professors of microbiology and biomedical in our school for their professional advice.
                    Besides the communications, we have done an insightful social survey, to gain better understanding
                    about what people concern about cancer, as well as their attitude towards our project. The social
                    survey results inspired us to reconsider the security level and the future application of our
                    project. Meanwhile, we sensed that another mission for us is to help the public learn more about
                    cancer and its treatment, as well as the difference that synthetic biology can make in future
                    approach. To accomplish that, we held a live seminar to share our idea and then started to blog
                    newly emerged cancer therapies, basic aspects of synthetic biology and our project. It is also
                    a platform, in which we can keep offerring people cancer-related information with a
                    more lucid way to express. We also answered their questions in person for the best effects at
                    comment area.</P><DIV class="h2">Enhanced Safe Properties</DIV><P>We carried out our project with full compliance with the safety policies and safety rules (see also
                    <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/Safety">Safety</A> for details). In analyzing the
                    results of expert consultation and public investigation (see
                    also <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/Public_Engagement">Education</A> for details),
                    we concluded that an enhancement of safe properties nevertheless
                    should be considered as a first priority. After a careful reconsideration, we introduced two major
                    safety improvement. First, we knocked out the <I>sifA</I> gene from <I>Salmonella Typhimurium</I>
                    str. SL1344
                    genome by conjugation transfer, in order to weaken its pathogenicity. Although <I>Salmonella</I>
                    has
                    already been used in some cancer therapy research, its pathogenic bacteria identity had limited its
                    anticancer application. After collecting opinions from experts, we decided to perform this gene
                    knock-out. Then we demonstrated the effect of this change by using macrophage assay, where Δ<I>sifA</I>
                    strain cannot replicate effectively in the host cell after infection, in contrast with the control
                    group (see also <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/Design">Design</A> and <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/Results">Results</A>
                    for more information). This effect means the Δ<I>sifA</I> strain can be
                    easily cleaned by human macrophage, which can prevent unexpected infection from occurring. On the
                    other hand, even though <I>Salmonella</I> have natural taxis towards tumor microenvironment and
                    attack
                    tumor cells selectively, any destructions done to the non-tumor tissue remain unacceptable. For the
                    purpose of an accurate attack, we displayed RGD motif on the bacteria surface to demonstrate an
                    enhanced targeting specificity towards tumor cells covered by αvβ3 integrin (see also <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/Design">Design</A>
