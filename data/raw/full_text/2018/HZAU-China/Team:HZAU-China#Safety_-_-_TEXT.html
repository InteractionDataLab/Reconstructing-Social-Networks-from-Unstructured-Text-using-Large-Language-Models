Introduction
This year, we have done a lot of work in order to meet the requirement of biosafety. After                     collecting                     opinions from experts and the public, we learned that the general concerns are about: How is it                     safe to                     apply bacteriotherapy against cancer without causing unexpected damage or infection? We took these                     concerns seriously and have found some practical solutions.
Safety Form
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344 is not entirely harmless. In fact, the                     strain                     SL1344 which we chose for our                     project may as well cause slight enteritis. However, we chose it base on the fact that it is a                     well-learned intracellular pathogen with a lot of engineering experiences we can refer to, which is                     suitable for delivering GSDMD into cells. So we finished the Check in Form and the Safety and                     Security                     Form carefully to make sure the information is clear and intact as well as we can.
Salmonella Gene Knock out
Gene sifA is a vital gene located in Salmonella pathogenicity island, which increases                     the stability                     of Salmonella-Containing Vacuole (SCV) after infection. We knocked out the sifA gene                     from Salmonella Typhimurium str. SL1344 genome by conjugation transfer. The aim is to reduce the toxicity of Salmonella itself, then to allow the GSDMD protein, which is able to rupture the phospholipid bilayer structure,                     to be released into the cytoplasm of a tumor cell.                     After gene knock out, the strain can be easily controlled by human macrophage. See also Design and Results pages for details.
Enhanced Targeting Specificity
Salmonella has natural taxis towards tumor microenvironment. Base on the results of public                     survey                     and                     some opinions from experts, we decided to enhance the targeting specificity to a new level. We                     designed                     a new circuit to introduce OmpA-RGD protein as a surface recognition molecule, where RGD is a                     well-studied tumor homing tripeptide that binds specifically to alpha v beta 3 (αvβ3) integrin, a                     protein widely distributed on the surface of tumor cells. We successfully displayed RGD on the                     surface                     of a bacteria strain, and also proved its targeting ability towards αvβ3. See also Design and Results pages.
Lab Safety
General Safety Matters
In our lab there is a safety training for everyone which covered the following aspects:
1. Personal peripheral wear: Lab coat and gloves must be worn all the time during work. Personnel                     must                     wash their hands after experiments, or before they leave the laboratory working areas. Open-toed                     footwear must not be worn in laboratories. Eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics, handling                     contact lenses and sleeping are prohibited in the laboratory working areas.
2. Chemical safety: We printed "Dos and don'ts when using hazardous chemicals" and posted them on                     marked place. Students are trained to use dry powder extinguishers and carbon dioxide fire                     extinguishers in our lab.
3. GMO safety: No biological materials are allowed to be brought out of our lab. Strains must be put                     into death before dumping.
4. Study of guidelines: We listed some biosafety websites used for team member education:

Our lab
Our lab locates in the building for School of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural                     University. An access controlling system prevents unauthorized person from entering, and one has to                     show the student ID card to get into the door. Our biological wastes are managed by trained stuff,                     therefore                     will not enter the water body or contaminate the outside environment.

Policies
Here we illustrate that our 2018 project did not involve human experimentation, gene drive, use of                     animals, or use of any parts from risk group 4 organisms. Our compliance with the “Do Not Release”,                     “Deletions as Modification” and “Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR)” policies is demonstrated above,                     as we                     always take care of what we use and never let experimental organisms with resistance plasmid or                     genome                     modification out of the lab alive without handling. As for the Human Subject Research policy, our                     survey is basically about the public’s opinions or attitude towards newly emerged cancer                     treatments,                     which barely involved any ethical issues. Nevertheless, we referred to the “Guidelines on Ethical                     Review of Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (NHFPC, 2016)” and the “International                     Guidelines on Market Views, Social Surveys and Data Analysis (ICC/ESOMAR, 2016)” before designing                     the                     questionnaire, for the protection of the public. All the safety rules are also obeyed; see previous                     descriptions.
