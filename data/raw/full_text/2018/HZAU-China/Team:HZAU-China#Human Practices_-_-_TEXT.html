Overview
As the Chinese saying goes, “know the enemy and know yourself, and you can fight a hundred battles                     with no danger of defeat”. In the battle with cancer, we have gained great knowledge about the                     “enemy”, as well as our own immune system. However, despite the success in curing early and middle                     stage cancers we have made, the lack of public comprehension is still likely to cause panic. We                     sensed that our mission is to help the public learn more about cancer and its treatment, as well as                     the difference that synthetic biology can make in future approach. To accomplish that, we held a                     live seminar to share our idea and then started to blog newly emerged cancer therapies, basic                     aspects of synthetic biology and our project. Meanwhile, letting the public know that their voices                     have been heard is also very important, so we collected their opinions carefully through public                     survey, designed new circuits for their safety concerns, and invited them for discussion on our                     team blog. To explore the further application and the potential risk, we also communicated with                     some cancer experts. We want to be a communicating bridge during this battle where information is                     accessible to everyone who needs it.
Silver Human Practice
Safety
This year, we have done a lot of work in order to meet the requirement of biosafety. After                     collecting opinions from experts and the public, we learned that the general concerns are about:                     How is it safe to apply bacteriotherapy against cancer without causing unexpected damage or                     infection? We took these concerns seriously and have found some practical solutions.
EXPERT interviews
Prof. Jin He
College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University.
Professor Jin He has given us a lot of useful suggestions and instructions. As an                                 expert in                                 microbes, he points out that Salmonella is a kind of safe bacterium which is                                 widely                                 used in                                 researches around the world. After knocking out a series of genes, the harm of Salmonella is                                 acceptable. He also points out that Salmonella has very common with E.coli on behalf                                 that                                 both                                 bacteria are in Enterobacteriaceae. This means that we can incubate Salmonella on the                                 same                                 condition and cultivation with E. coli. In addition, Salmonella is very                                 similar to E.                                     coli in                                 genetics, which means many metabolic reactions happen in E. coli would also                                 happen in Salmonella. Besides, he tells us that there are many intracellular parasites                                 well                                 studied                                 such                                 as Listeria , so we have many choices in the future. In conclusion, his indispensable                                 instructions have made up our minds to engineer on Salmonella.
Dr. Qike Jia
Doctor of Hubei Tumor Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, PRC.
Doctor Qike Jia is a young doctor works in Hubei Tumor Hospital and has some experiences                                 in                                 tumor treatment. He is familiar with all popular tumor therapies in China and has given                                 us                                 an                                 overview of tumor treatments. When asked about what the most used therapy at present                                 is,                                 the                                 doctor directly pointed out that it is surgery without hesitate. He thinks that                                 operating                                 on                                 patients is always the first thing to do when a doctor is facing a tumor in medium or                                 late                                 stage. After cutting off tumor issues, radiation and chemical therapies can be carried                                 out                                 for                                 further clearance of tumor cells. When asked about the opinion to our project, he                                 encouraged us                                 with a big smile on his face. He said our project is quite good and expectable,                                 although we                                 may                                 have faced some trouble. Cell cultivation is a really hard work taking a lot of time                                 and                                 spirits. Even if we could complete the project, we still need an enormous amount of                                 efforts                                 to                                 push our therapy to the market. He hoped that we could overcome all the difficulties                                 and gain                                 the final success.
Dr. Yingchun Qi
HZAU biological experimental teaching center deputy director Dr. Yingchun Qi is one of the people who have the closest connection with our lab.                                 She                                 is                                 majored in cell culture and genetic transformation. Every year, she will conduct safety                                 education to us when we first build the team. At the same time, she also supervises                                 the                                 daily                                 hygiene practices of our laboratories. In the conversation with her, we understand the                                 importance of many security systems and their sources. And, she often comes to the lab                                 to                                 see                                 us and cares about our lives.
Prf. Cao Gang
Professor of Huazhong Agricultural University, doctoral tutor, head of Department of                                     Basic Veterinary Science, deputy director of Biomedical Center.
In July, we had a nice symposium with Cao. At that time, our team didn’t come up with a                                 mature                                 project. Since Cao is major in Biomedical, we asked him for help and he responded us                                 warmly. In                                 a special symposium, He pointed the weakness is our naïve thoughts and helped us                                 strengthen                                 the                                 advantages. He taught us tremendous things about pyroptosis, including it’s pathway and                                 recent                                 researches in that field, and encouraged us to march on. Cao is so enthusiastic about                                 our                                 project and willing to give us a helping hand.
Education & Public                         Engagement
After attending meetings and analyzing questionnaires, we learned that there are many concerns about                     the use of bacteria to treat cancer. We thought people's scruple is largely because they know                     little about bacterial therapy and synthetic biology. So, we not only set up a blog for                     popularizing science about synthetic biology and our project, but also gave lectures to freshmen in                     our university about our work to get more feedback. Through above activities, we expanded the scope                     of our survey. By making people more aware of synthetic biology and bacterial therapy, they became                     more receptive to our project. In the survey results and discussion on our blog, we realized that                     more knowledge can significantly reduce peoples’ worries. During our education engagement, we also                     had more safety thinking and better performance in our experimental design.
Integrated Human Practice
Pyroptosis therapy, as a new approach derived from cell natural defense mechanism, can bring                     positive                     effects to human health with our rightful use. We all know that one day synthetic biologists will                     develop                     artificial life forms as vehicles. At that point, pyroptosis carried out by these excellent tools                     will                     release its enormous potential, work just like the nanorobots in science fiction movies, leaving                     cancer cells                     nowhere to hide. Within the right hands, it can provide us with new opportunities of making the                     world a                     better place.
For a new treatment, a person or institution cannot represent all human beings to define it.                     Therefore, our integrated human practice aims to hear voices from both experts and the public, in                     order to analyze and improve our project. At the beginning, we participated in two conference                     meetings in mainland China, and had an in-depth communication with the teams who had conducted the                     tumor treatment related projects like us. Then, we consulted several experts from Hubei Cancer                     Hospital and professors of microbiology and biomedical in our school for their professional advice.                     Besides the communications, we have done an insightful social survey, to gain better understanding                     about what people concern about cancer, as well as their attitude towards our project. The social                     survey results inspired us to reconsider the security level and the future application of our                     project. Meanwhile, we sensed that another mission for us is to help the public learn more about                     cancer and its treatment, as well as the difference that synthetic biology can make in future                     approach. To accomplish that, we held a live seminar to share our idea and then started to blog                     newly emerged cancer therapies, basic aspects of synthetic biology and our project. It is also                     a platform, in which we can keep offerring people cancer-related information with a                     more lucid way to express. We also answered their questions in person for the best effects at                     comment area.
Enhanced Safe Properties
We carried out our project with full compliance with the safety policies and safety rules (see also Safety for details). In analyzing the                     results of expert consultation and public investigation (see                     also Education for details),                     we concluded that an enhancement of safe properties nevertheless                     should be considered as a first priority. After a careful reconsideration, we introduced two major                     safety improvement. First, we knocked out the sifA gene from Salmonella Typhimurium str. SL1344                     genome by conjugation transfer, in order to weaken its pathogenicity. Although Salmonella has                     already been used in some cancer therapy research, its pathogenic bacteria identity had limited its                     anticancer application. After collecting opinions from experts, we decided to perform this gene                     knock-out. Then we demonstrated the effect of this change by using macrophage assay, where ΔsifA strain cannot replicate effectively in the host cell after infection, in contrast with the control                     group (see also Design and Results for more information). This effect means the ΔsifA strain can be                     easily cleaned by human macrophage, which can prevent unexpected infection from occurring. On the                     other hand, even though Salmonella have natural taxis towards tumor microenvironment and                     attack                     tumor cells selectively, any destructions done to the non-tumor tissue remain unacceptable. For the                     purpose of an accurate attack, we displayed RGD motif on the bacteria surface to demonstrate an                     enhanced targeting specificity towards tumor cells covered by αvβ3 integrin (see also Design and Results for more information).
