Background
The importance of cancer treatments has already come to light. This year, we turned to this common                     concern and found out a new approach to help its solution.
Cancer
Cancers, the feral diseases that link to abnormal cell growth and surrounding tissues invasion, were                     earliest written in the Edwin Smith Papyrus in about 1600 BC1. Because of its high                     mortality and                     the extreme suffering, efficient therapies firmly come into the public consciousness. During these                     years, cancers have impelled the development of medical technology which serves as the powerful                     tool to defend against and advances in technology; this also have led to a rise in life expectancy.                     Despite its improvement, the result of Global Cancer Statistics 2018 predicts that there will be                     about 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6                     million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) at the end of 20182.                     It's                     obvious that we still have a long way to go.
Pyroptosis
We utilize a newly reported mechanism, pyroptosis, to treat cancers. Pyroptosis is a lytic form                     of inflammatory cell death which is mediated by activation of Caspases 1, 3, 4, 5 and 11. The                     morphology of pyroptosis is characterized by cell swelling and rupturing which causes releasing of                     cytoplasmic contents of the cell, including proinflammatory cytokines, endogenous ligands,                     alarmins, ATP and other danger-associated molecules3. What's important is that                     protein                     Gasdermin D (GSDMD) has been found as an essential effector of pyroptosis in recent studies4.                     When                     host cells are defending the infection, full-length Gasdermin D will be cleaved by Caspases and the                     process will expose the N-terminal of Gasdemin D (PFD, pore form domain) from RD (repressor                     domain). PFD can oligomerize and form pores on the plasma membrane from the intracellular side,and                     then sodium and water rush into the cell, causing cell rupture.                     Simultaneously, cytokines such as IL-1βand IL-18 are released into the extracellular environment                     through the Gasdermin pores (Figure 1).
Some features about the relationship between pyroptosis and cancers are demonstrated in recent                     studies:
1. Berberine inhibits the viability of HepG2 cell through induction of pyroptosis5.
2. Caspase 1 rescues the sensitivity of radiant lethality in prostate cancer, increasing the                     proportion of died cancer cells after radiation therapy6.
3. Nlrp3-/- mice without pyroptosis pathway are susceptible to catch                     colitis-associated colon cancer7.
These meaningful studies help us to exploit advantage of pyroptosis in tumor therapy.

Carrier
Our project aims to cure cancer by triggering pyroptosis through translocating the N-terminal of                     GSDMD                     (GSDMD-N275). There are many vectors can be used such as oncolytic virus, macromolecular carrier                     and                     bacteria. In our project, we chose Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344                     as a carrier. Why we chose Salmonella as our carrier is based on the following reasons.                     First, GSDMD-N275 can only induce pyroptosis from the inside of a cell, therefore Salmonella is a                     brilliant candidate as an intracellular parasite. Second, Salmonella is a widely used                     carrier to cancer therapy because its natural taxis to tumor8.
Significance
It's important to highlight the significance our project.
1. Switch apoptosis to pyroptosis in chemical therapy
Numerous patients accept chemotherapy during their fight against cancers though there are terrible                     drawbacks. Chemotherapy drugs can activate caspase-3-mediated pyroptosis in normal cells while                     apoptosis in cancer cells, resulting in severe healthy tissue damage and inefficient tumor cure9.                     However, our designed circuit can trigger pyroptosis in cancer cells to solve this problem (Figure                         2).

2. Pyroptosis make tumor expose to immune system
The lysate of cell rupture during pyroptosis can destroy tumor microenvironment which is vital to                     tumor growth. Pyroptosis not only releases "find me" signals but also "eat me" signals10.                     Pyroptosis induces greater ATP release than apoptosis to attract more immune cells into tumor bed,                     which is one of the "find me" signals. Also, ATP can bind to purinergic P2RX7 receptors on                     dentritic cell (DC),                     activating the NLRP3/ASC/Caspase-1 inflammasome and secreting interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is                     required for CD8+ T cells to release IFN-γ which lyse tumor cells11. The "eat                     me" signal is the                     phosphatidylserine externalization which recruits macrophages to engulf the tumor cells (Figure                         3).

3. Pyroptosis combined with antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) will become more                         efficient
Some monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab (TRAST), alemtuzumab, cetuximab and panitumumab                     have been utilized for both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies treatments through                     ADCC12 (Figure 4). It's a special way to recruit natural killer cells (NK cells), macrophages, γδ T                     cells, and                     dendritic cells to against cancer. However, lower activity of NK cells hinders the development of                     this                     approach13. In our project, we give a new approach to solve this problem. IL-18 released                     from                     pyroptotic cells can stimulate NK cells proliferation and activation14. Meanwhile,                     pyroptosis also up-regulates intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1 or CD54) which binds to                     alpha integrin on the tumor cell, resulting in enhancing the affinity between NK cells and tumor                     cells15 (Figure 5).

4. Safe utilization of the N-terminal of GSDMD
Recent studies demonstrated that the N-terminal of GSDMD performs function through binding to                     inositol phosphate (present in inner leaflet of cell membrane) in eukaryotic cell but cardiolipin                     (present in the inner and outer leaflets of cell membranes) in bacteria16. Thus, the                     N-terminal of                     GSDMD releasing from bacteria is avirulent to normal cells (because of its extracellular location                     to normal cells), but can attack tumor cells and redundant bacteria from inside.
