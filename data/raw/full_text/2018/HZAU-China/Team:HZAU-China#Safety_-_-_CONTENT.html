After
                    collecting
                    opinions from experts and the public, we learned that the general concerns are about: How is it
                    safe to
                    apply bacteriotherapy against cancer without causing unexpected damage or infection? We took these
                    concerns seriously and have found some practical solutions.</P><DIV class="h2">Safety Form</DIV><P><I>Salmonella enterica</I> serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344 is not entirely harmless. In fact, the
                    strain
                    SL1344 which we chose for our
                    project may as well cause slight enteritis. However, we chose it base on the fact that it is a
                    well-learned intracellular pathogen with a lot of engineering experiences we can refer to, which is
                    suitable for delivering GSDMD into cells. So we finished the Check in Form and the Safety and
                    Security
                    Form carefully to make sure the information is clear and intact as well as we can.</P><DIV class="h2"><I>Salmonella</I> Gene Knock out</DIV><P>Gene <I>sifA</I> is a vital gene located in <I>Salmonella</I> pathogenicity island, which increases
                    the stability
                    of
                    <I>Salmonella</I>-Containing Vacuole (SCV) after infection. We knocked out the <I>sifA</I> gene
                    from <I>Salmonella</I><I>Typhimurium</I> str. SL1344 genome by conjugation transfer. The aim is to reduce the toxicity of
                    <I>Salmonella</I>
                    itself, then to allow the GSDMD protein, which is able to rupture the phospholipid bilayer structure,
                    to be released into the cytoplasm of a tumor cell.
                    After gene knock out, the strain can be easily controlled by human macrophage. See also <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/Design">Design</A>

                    survey
                    and
                    some opinions from experts, we decided to enhance the targeting specificity to a new level. We
                    designed
                    a new circuit to introduce OmpA-RGD protein as a surface recognition molecule, where RGD is a
                    well-studied tumor homing tripeptide that binds specifically to alpha v beta 3 (αvβ3) integrin, a
                    protein widely distributed on the surface of tumor cells. We successfully displayed RGD on the
                    surface
                    of a bacteria strain, and also proved its targeting ability towards αvβ3. See also <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/Design">Design</A>

Personal peripheral wear: Lab coat and gloves must be worn all the time during work. Personnel
                    must
                    wash their hands after experiments, or before they leave the laboratory working areas. Open-toed
                    footwear must not be worn in laboratories. Eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics, handling
                    contact lenses and sleeping are prohibited in the laboratory working areas.</P><P>2. Chemical safety: We printed &quot;Dos and don'ts when using hazardous chemicals&quot; and posted them on
                    marked place. Students are trained to use dry powder extinguishers and carbon dioxide fire
                    extinguishers in our lab.</P><P>3. GMO safety: No biological materials are allowed to be brought out of our lab. Strains must be put
                    into death before dumping.</P><P>4. Study of guidelines: We listed some biosafety websites used for team member education:</P><P style="width: 100%; text-align: center !important;"><B>Figure 1.</B> Lab safety seminar</P><P> Govern biosafety in research laboratories:<A href="http://english.biosafety.gov.cn/">http://english.biosafety.gov.cn/</A>

                    University. An access controlling system prevents unauthorized person from entering, and one has to
                    show the student ID card to get into the door. Our biological wastes are managed by trained stuff,
                    therefore
                    will not enter the water body or contaminate the outside environment.</P><P style="width: 100%; text-align: center !important;"><B>Figure 2.</B> Door access control</P><DIV class="h2">Policies</DIV><P>Here we illustrate that our 2018 project did not involve human experimentation, gene drive, use of
                    animals, or use of any parts from risk group 4 organisms. Our compliance with the “Do Not Release”,
                    “Deletions as Modification” and “Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR)” policies is demonstrated above,
                    as we
                    always take care of what we use and never let experimental organisms with resistance plasmid or
                    genome
                    modification out of the lab alive without handling. As for the Human Subject Research policy, our
                    survey is basically about the public’s opinions or attitude towards newly emerged cancer
                    treatments,
                    which barely involved any ethical issues. Nevertheless, we referred to the “Guidelines on Ethical
                    Review of Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (NHFPC, 2016)” and the “International
                    Guidelines on Market Views, Social Surveys and Data Analysis (ICC/ESOMAR, 2016)” before designing
                    the
                    questionnaire, for the protection of the public. All the safety rules are also obeyed; see previous
                    descriptions.</P></DIV><DIV id="float03"><DIV class="h1">Reference</DIV><P>1. Understanding Biosecurity; National research council of The National Academics, Rita r. Colwell
