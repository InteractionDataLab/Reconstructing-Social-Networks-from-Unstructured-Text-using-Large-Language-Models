                    and SDU-CHINA</DIV><P>Optogenetic tool has broad prospects on synthetic biology, and the CcaS-CcaR system, which is
                    developed from <I>cyanobacteria</I> has made obvious achievements, thus more and more teams are
                    willing to
                    use this system in their own projects. In the past two years, we have spent a great deal of time
                    using it in our projects and accumulated a lot of experience (see more information in our previous
                    wikis). This year, we collaborated with WHU-China and SDU-CHINA who use this system in their projects and
                    sharing the experience how we regulated the expression of CcaS and CcaR protein to control this
                    optogenetic tool and what we achieved.
                </P></DIV><DIV id="float02"><DIV class="h1">Experience sharing with Worldshaper-Wuhan</DIV><P>We cooperated with the high school team, Worldshaper-Wuhan. We shared some information about our
                    project and had several
                    discussions then determined to have an experiment about the lncRNA IL7-AS in multiple cell lines.
                    LncRNA IL7-AS is a newly discovered lncRNA, which might be a potential diagnostic biomarker and
                    therapeutic target for renal cell carcinoma. Through this experiment, firstly, we want to know if
                    the IL7-AS has tissue specificity to distinguish between cancer cells and healthy cells or not.
                    Secondly, we want to explore its applicability for which this biomarker can be widely utilized to
                    detect tumours. The Worldshaper-Wuhan team successfully demonstrated that IL7-AS has specificity and
                    universality. There were significant expression differences among 293T (the healthy cell), 769-P
                    (the adenocarcinoma cell) and 786-O (the adenocarcinoma cell) cell lines. The expression in 769-P
                    and 786-O were higher than that of 293T, showing specificity and universality of IL7-AS. Through our
                    team's suggestions and Worldshaper-Wuhan's experiment, their project improved and we also got a new
                    biomarker
                    and therapeutic target for future projects.

                                necessary to
                                enhance the targeting of engineered <I>Salmonella</I> we used, we designed a fuse
                                protein which
                                called OmpA-RGD to achieve
                                this goal. RGD is a well-studied tumor homing tripeptide that specifically binds to
                                alpha v beta 3
                                (αvβ3) integrin, which is widely overexpressed on cancer cells. So there’s a cell line
                                called
                                MDA-MB-231 surface displaying αvβ3 needed for our further targeting and safety
                                experiments, with
                                the great help of NAU-CHINA , we had channels to get this cell line from Shanghai

                                Biochemistry and Cell Biology.

                    helped us freeze the plasmid into dry powder in 96 well plate format, label our plate with our team name and
                    submission number, and eventually send it by express to the agency in China. We are extremely grateful for their help.
                </P><DIV class="h1">EurAisan Meetup</DIV><P>We also took part in the iGEM EurAisan Meetup, where we shared our ideas and learned a lot. At the
                    meeting, we had friendly communications with many iGEMers and gained a lot of advice during this
                    meetup. They suggested more possible delivery vehicles to our project and a more logical poster
                    design. We took part in a quiz competition and were awarded the prize for best collaboration quiz
                    with our buddy team SFLS_Shenzhen. After the meetup, we're still talking on WeChat.
                </P><DIV class="h1">CCiC meeting</DIV><P>In August, we participated in the biggest iGEMer communication conference in China——Conference of
                    China iGEMer Community (CCiC). During this meeting, we communicated with teams tracking on therapy and reflected more about our project. For further collaboration，we met the captain of WHU-China and
                    talked about the experience of our optogenetic tool.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="cebian"><A class="daohangyi" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/Team"><SPAN class="biaoti">Team</SPAN></A><A class="daohangyi" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/Attributions"><SPAN class="biaoti">Attributions</SPAN></A><DIV class="daohangyi"><SPAN class="biaoti">Collaborations</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="floatCtro"><A><SPAN>Back to Top</SPAN></A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
