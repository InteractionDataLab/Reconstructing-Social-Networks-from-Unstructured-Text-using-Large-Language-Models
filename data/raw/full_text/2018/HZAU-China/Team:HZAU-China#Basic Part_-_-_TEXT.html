N-terminal of Gasdermin D (1-275aa)
Pyroptosis is a form of lytic programmed cell death with inflammation. Recent studies reported that the N-terminal of GSDMD acts as an effector of pyroptosis. Full length GSDMD (GSDMD FL) is cleaved by Caspase 1, releasing the pore-forming domain (GSDMD-N275), which can oligomerize and make pores on the cell membrane. Formation of pores causes cell to swell, leading to membrane rupture and massive leakage of cytosolic contents1.
The N-terminal of GSDMD performs the function of pyroptosis in cells
We fused eGFP with GSDMD-N275 (N-terminal 275 amino acids) and GSDMD FL (full length), respectively. Then the corresponding                     plasmids were transfected into Hela GSDMD knockout (KO) cell. Cell microscopy showed that the cells                     transfected with GSDMD-N275 underwent pyroptosis while the cells with GSDMD FL did not (Figure 1).                     We also tested the cell viability through an ATP assay (CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability                     Assay) and demonstrated that GSDMD-N275 and mutants of GSDMD FL have different abilities to induce                     pyroptosis (Figure 2).

GSDMD-N275 can lyse bacteria
Expression of the N-terminal of GSDMD fused with eGFP (eGFP-GSDMD-N275) in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344 ΔsifA is under the control of Ptet. The                     colony-forming unit (CFU)                     was measured for counting the number of viable bacterial cells (Figure 3). This result shows that                     eGFP-GSDMD-N275 exhibits cytotoxicity in bacteria.
Figure 3. CFU comparison between the SL1344 ΔsifA cells with eGFP-GSDMD-N275 plasmid                     and with the                     empty vector. In each group, ATc (15μg/ml) was added into medium when bacterium grew to logarithmic phase (OD = 0.6~0.8). Vector refers to bacterium containing a high copy number plasmid which only                     expresses TetR under the control of Ptet. CFU for vector                     and eGFP-GSDMD-N275 are shown in the logarithmic form (log10) (n=3).
Method
1. Bacteria are cultured overnight in LB broth containing corresponding antibiotics, and                         dilute each 1 volume overnight cultures with 100 volume fresh LB containing antibiotics.                         Culture in 37℃ 200 rpm.
2. When OD reaching to 0.6-0.8, add anhydrotetracycline with final concentration of                         μg/ml to induce the expression of EGFP-GSDMD-N275.
3. Take 100 μl diluted culture to plate on LB agar plates containing appropriate concentration                         of antibody after 1.5 hours of induce.
Observation is taken overnight.
GSDMD-N275 from lytic bacteria induces host cell pyroptosis
Expression of the N-terminal of GSDMD fused with eGFP (eGFP-GSDMD-N275) is under the control of tet                     promoter in ΔsifA SL1344. Hela GSDMD KO cells were infected with ΔsifA SL1344.                     Inducer ATc                     (16μg/mL) were added 3h after infection. Microscopy shows that eGFP-GSDMD-N275 located in cytoplasm                     after 5 min of induction and triggered pyroptosis after 30 min of induction (Figure 4). After                     1.5 h                     of induction, Hela GSDMD KO cells underwent second necrosis caused by bacterial infection without inducer. Morphology of this process is similar to pyroptosis2. Thus, the population of                     ruptured                     cells was counted. There is 1.96 fold change between control group and induced group (Figure 5).                     So                     the pyroptosis of host cell in the induced group was triggered by eGFP-GSDMD-N275 not by bacterial                     infection.
Figure 4. Hela GSDMD KO cells were infected with ΔsifA SL1344 containing high copy                     number plasmids                     which express eGFP-GSDMD-N275 under the control of ATc. Photographs were captured 5 min, 30 min, 90 min                     after induction, respectively.

2. Subculture bacteria by transferring 300 μL of the overnight culture into 5 mL of LB in a                         loosely capped 50-mL tube. Incubate at 37 °C in a shaking incubator (200 rpm) to late log                         phase.
3. Pellet 1 mL of the Salmonella subculture by centrifugation at 1,000×g in a microfuge                         for 2                         min at room temperature.
