2. Culture Condition
Culture medium
Compositions
Luria Broth (LB)
0.5% yeast extraction,1% NaCl and 1% tryptone (add 15 g/L agar when prepare solid                                 culture)
Super Optimal Broth (SOB)
0.5% yeast extraction, 0.05% NaCl and 2% tryptone (add 15 g/L agar when prepare solid                                 culture) (add 5ml 2 mol/L MgCl2 before use)
Method
1. Plasmid construction
Our fragments was PCR amplified with KOD (TOYOBO®) or PrimeSTAR (Takara®)                     according to product length.
Product is recycled with gel extraction kit from OMEGA® after electrophoresis.
ClonExpress® II One Step Cloning Kit (Vyzyme) was used to ligate every fragment to                     construct the most plasmids.
All plasmid constructs were conﬁrmed by sequencing at Sangon®, Inc. (Wuhan,China).
A single frozen glycerol stock was used throughout this study for each bacterial strain.
2. Transformation
1. Add 3-5μl plasmid to 50μl F-trans5α (Weidi Biotechnology) competent cells and incubate 5min in ice                     , coated plates, select monoclonal colony PCR. Add extra 42℃ heat shock 45s and incubate 10min step                     will increase transformation efficiency.                     Or 1.5kv, 4-5ms electroporate cell with 300-400 ng purified plasmid. Recover at 37°C 950 rpm for 1h.
2. Plated on LB agar plates containing appropriate concentration of antibody for selection, grown                     overnight at 37°C. And prepare PCR reaction to select individual bacterial colony.
3. Fluorescence/growth measurememt
Cell are cultured overnight in LB broth containing corresponding antibiotics, and diluted to OD is                     0.1 with fresh LB broth.
Expression was induced at early log phase by addition of different ATc (150 ng/ml–15μg/ml)                     concentrations. Culture the plate in 37℃, 150 rpm. Every hour put it into a plate reader to                     measure its fluorescence/OD1.
Modeling impact our experiment
The higher ATc level might thwart bacterial growth. So we need to analyze a proper concentration of                     ATc, We design a modeling to predict a suitable concentration of ATc (More result about our model                     please check modeling: Chemical control model ).                     We induced our engineered strain with gradients of ATc. Take 100μl culture to plate on LB agar                     plates containing appropriate concentration of antibody after 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 90 minutes of                     induce and counting Colony Forming Units the next day. The results fit the model within a range of                     ATc. So we choose a appropriate concentration of ATc (16μg/ml), aiming to maximize the expression of                     GSDMD-N275 and minimize the negative effect of bacteria growth.
