Processing of experiment results
1. Verification of Poisson distribution
We infect tumor cells (HeLa GSDMD KO cell line) with Salmonella carrying the GFP gene for a period of time and                      then count them, and the result is that the distribution of Salmonella in the tumor cells                     is consistent with a Poisson distribution.
Figure 1. Infection of HeLa GSDMD KO cells by Salmonella and the result of analysis.
The amounts of host cells and bacteria were measured in experiments.
The concentration of bacteria was calculated according to MOI (multiplicity of infection) and cell density.
We adjusted the parameter As to match the curve with the results of the Salmonella infection experiment. When As is                     equal to 0.0003, the curve simulated by the mathematical model matches the experimental measurements.
Figure 2. Parameter fitting of the tumor                     cells infection experiments. Red points are experimental results.
The parameters ‘Nsal’ and ‘Tumor’ are already known before the experiment. When the parameter ‘As’ is 0.0003,                     the model results best fit the experimental results.
