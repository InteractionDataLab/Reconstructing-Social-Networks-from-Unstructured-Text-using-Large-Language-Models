This year, we turned to this common
                    concern and found out a new approach to help its solution.</P><DIV class="h2">Cancer</DIV><P>Cancers, the feral diseases that link to abnormal cell growth and surrounding tissues invasion, were
                    earliest written in the Edwin Smith Papyrus in about 1600 BC<SUP>1</SUP>. Because of its high
                    mortality and
                    the extreme suffering, efficient therapies firmly come into the public consciousness. During these
                    years, cancers have impelled the development of medical technology which serves as the powerful
                    tool to defend against and advances in technology; this also have led to a rise in life expectancy.
                    Despite its improvement, the result of Global Cancer Statistics 2018 predicts that there will be
                    about 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6
                    million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) at the end of 2018<SUP>2</SUP>.
                    It's
                    obvious that we still have a long way to go. </P><DIV class="h2">Pyroptosis</DIV><P>We utilize a newly reported mechanism, pyroptosis, to treat cancers. Pyroptosis is a lytic form
                    of inflammatory cell death which is mediated by activation of Caspases 1, 3, 4, 5 and 11. The
                    morphology of pyroptosis is characterized by cell swelling and rupturing which causes releasing of
                    cytoplasmic contents of the cell, including proinflammatory cytokines, endogenous ligands,
                    alarmins, ATP and other danger-associated molecules<SUP>3</SUP>. What's important is that
                    protein
                    Gasdermin D (GSDMD) has been found as an essential effector of pyroptosis in recent studies<SUP>4</SUP>.
                    When
                    host cells are defending the infection, full-length Gasdermin D will be cleaved by Caspases and the
                    process will expose the N-terminal of Gasdemin D (PFD, pore form domain) from RD (repressor
                    domain). PFD can oligomerize and form pores on the plasma membrane from the intracellular side,and
                    then sodium and water rush into the cell, causing cell rupture.
                    Simultaneously, cytokines such as IL-1βand IL-18 are released into the extracellular environment
                    through the Gasdermin pores (<B>Figure 1</B>).</P><P>Some features about the relationship between pyroptosis and cancers are demonstrated in recent
                    studies:</P><P>1. Berberine inhibits the viability of HepG2 cell through induction of pyroptosis<SUP>5</SUP>.</P><P>2. Caspase 1 rescues the sensitivity of radiant lethality in prostate cancer, increasing the
                    proportion of died cancer cells after radiation therapy<SUP>6</SUP>.</P><P>3. <I>Nlrp3</I><SUP>-/-</SUP> mice without pyroptosis pathway are susceptible to catch
                    colitis-associated colon cancer<SUP>7</SUP>.</P><P>These meaningful studies help us to exploit advantage of pyroptosis in tumor therapy.</P><P style="width: 100%; text-align: center !important;"><B>Figure 1.</B> Schematic diagram of
                    pyroptosis.</P><DIV class="h2">Carrier</DIV><P>Our project aims to cure cancer by triggering pyroptosis through translocating the N-terminal of
                    GSDMD
                    (GSDMD-N275). There are many vectors can be used such as oncolytic virus, macromolecular carrier
                    and
                    bacteria. In our project, we chose <I>Salmonella enterica</I> serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344
                    as a carrier. Why we chose <I>Salmonella</I> as our carrier is based on the following reasons.
                    First, GSDMD-N275 can only induce pyroptosis from the inside of a cell, therefore <I>Salmonella</I>
                    is a
                    brilliant candidate as an intracellular parasite. Second, <I>Salmonella</I> is a widely used
                    carrier to cancer therapy because its natural taxis to tumor<SUP>8</SUP>.

                    Numerous patients accept chemotherapy during their fight against cancers though there are terrible
                    drawbacks. Chemotherapy drugs can activate caspase-3-mediated pyroptosis in normal cells while
                    apoptosis in cancer cells, resulting in severe healthy tissue damage and inefficient tumor cure<SUP>9</SUP>.
                    However, our designed circuit can trigger pyroptosis in cancer cells to solve this problem (<B>Figure
                        2</B>).</P><P><B>Figure 2.</B> Difference between traditional approach and our approach for cancer therapy. G refers to GSDMD-N275 and E refers to GSDME.</P><P><B>2. Pyroptosis make tumor expose to immune system</B>
                    The lysate of cell rupture during pyroptosis can destroy tumor microenvironment which is vital to
                    tumor growth. Pyroptosis not only releases &quot;find me&quot; signals but also &quot;eat me&quot; signals<SUP>10</SUP>.
                    Pyroptosis induces greater ATP release than apoptosis to attract more immune cells into tumor bed,
                    which is one of the &quot;find me&quot; signals. Also, ATP can bind to purinergic P2RX7 receptors on
                    dentritic cell (DC),
                    activating the NLRP3/ASC/Caspase-1 inflammasome and secreting interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is
                    required for CD8<SUP>+</SUP> T cells to release IFN-γ which lyse tumor cells<SUP>11</SUP>. The &quot;eat
                    me&quot; signal is the
                    phosphatidylserine externalization which recruits macrophages to engulf the tumor cells (<B>Figure
                        3</B>).</P><P style="width: 100%; text-align: center !important;"><B>Figure 3.</B> Schematic diagram of immune
                    response during pyroptosis.</P><P><B>3. Pyroptosis combined with antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) will become more
                        efficient</B>
                    Some monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab (TRAST), alemtuzumab, cetuximab and panitumumab
                    have been utilized for both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies treatments through
                    ADCC<SUP>12</SUP> (<B>Figure 4</B>). It's a special way to recruit natural killer cells (NK cells), macrophages, γδ T
                    cells, and
                    dendritic cells to against cancer. However, lower activity of NK cells hinders the development of
                    this
                    approach<SUP>13</SUP>. In our project, we give a new approach to solve this problem. IL-18 released
                    from
                    pyroptotic cells can stimulate NK cells proliferation and activation<SUP>14</SUP>. Meanwhile,
                    pyroptosis also up-regulates intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1 or CD54) which binds to
                    alpha integrin on the tumor cell, resulting in enhancing the affinity between NK cells and tumor
                    cells<SUP>15</SUP> (<B>Figure 5</B>).</P><P style="width: 100%; text-align: center !important;"><B>Figure 4. </B>Schematic diagram of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. </P><P style="width: 100%; text-align: center !important;"><B>Figure 5. </B> Activation and proliferation of NK cells.</P><P><B>4. Safe utilization of the N-terminal of GSDMD</B>
                    Recent studies demonstrated that the N-terminal of GSDMD performs function through binding to
                    inositol phosphate (present in inner leaflet of cell membrane) in eukaryotic cell but cardiolipin
                    (present in the inner and outer leaflets of cell membranes) in bacteria<SUP>16</SUP>. Thus, the
                    N-terminal of
                    GSDMD releasing from bacteria is avirulent to normal cells (because of its extracellular location
                    to normal cells), but can attack tumor cells and redundant bacteria from inside.</P></DIV><DIV id="float03"><DIV class="h1">Reference</DIV><P>1. Steven, Hajdu. A note from history: Landmarks in history of cancer, part 1. Cancer, 117(5),
