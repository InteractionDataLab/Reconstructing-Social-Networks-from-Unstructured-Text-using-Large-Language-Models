Plasmid standardization was completed by Zhiqing Guo, Hangxi Fu and Zhuoqi Huang by using 3A                     Assembly.
Plasmid Submission:
Submitted plasmids (Pcs2-eGFP-GSDMD FL, Pcs2-eGFP-GSDMD-N275 and two GSDMD full length mutations)                     were constructed by Zhiqing Guo and Wenxin Hu.
The description of submitted plasmids by ATP assay and cell phenotype via transfection was designed                     and completed by Zhujun Xia.
Bacterial Phenotype Verification
Bacterial phenotype verifications were designed and completed by He Yang, including the OD                     measurement                     and CFU measurement of chemical control system.
Cell Phenotype Verification
Cell phenotype verifications were designed and completed by Zhujun Xia, including the                     verification                     of chemical control system, and targeting specificity, all the related circuits and the demonstration of the final work system.
Biosafety Verification
Safety verification was designed and completed by Zhujun Xia, which demonstrated our project                     is safe                     enough to be used.
InterLab
InterLab was conducted by Xichen Rao, Zhujun Xia, Ruonan Tian and Heng Heng also gave assistance.                     Our data passed the check of the Measurement Committee successfully.
Dry Lab
Mathematical model and app about salmonella infection and GSDMD release were built by Songtao                         Chen.
ATc model which predicted the relationship between concentration of ATc and concentration of GSDMD                     was built by Xichen Rao.
The modeling on adjusting the strength of RBS and ATc with fixed GSDMD-N concentration was completed                     by Yini Miao.
