The purpose of this yearâ€™s interlab protocol was to take the absorbance of the              bacterial stain E. Coli (created by transforming the plasmid) and standardize the              fluorescence rate for future use at iGEM.              Our next week of interlab lab work was split into two days: calibration day and              cell measurement protocol day. The team quickly learned the importance of accurate              pipetting as we had our first experiences with the plate reader.
We followed all the protocols provided by iGem, so click here to see the methods and materials we used.
Results:
After overnight incubation, we put out the samples and counted the one that had less             than 300 colonies. After counting the samples, we multiplied with the dilution factor             given in interlab to calculate CFU/mL. We had 6 samples each for positive and negative             controls, and it was categorized by dilution 3, 4, and 5, and each sample had a different             dilution factor according to the protocol. We noticed that there were a samples , so some of             the data had to be left blank. CFU stands for colony forming unit, so the number recorded as              CFU/mL shows the number of colonies present for every 1 mL of sample (similar as concept of              molarity). And the concentration of bacteria is directly related to the fluorescence.              If there is more concentration, it will fluorescence more. The measuring of absorbance also              helped us to see the concentration, since high concentration of bacteria will scatter the              light more than the diluted samples, resulting in the high absorbance value.
In this graph,                 we analyzed the relationship between absorbance and particle count.                 We found out that high absorbance means more scattering due to the                  high concentration of bacteria, and they have linear relationship.
This graph compares                  absorance and the particle count, and we found that slight change in absorbance.                  will change the particle count exponentially
After we analyzed the data                 of fluorscence during the cailibration process, we found that there is a direct                 relationship between fluorescein concentration and fluorscence
On this standard                 curve, we noticed that there is a minimum amount of fluorescein                 needed to express fluorescence. The non zero y intercept shows that example.
