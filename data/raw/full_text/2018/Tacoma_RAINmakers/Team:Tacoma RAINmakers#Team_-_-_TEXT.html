While Sarah is not in the lab, she is either reading, playing her guitar, or learning more about her other interests: French, history, and math. Sarah also does advanced ceramics in school and hopes to continue the subject in college next fall. Sarah is very passionate about her hobbies, and strives to learn as much as possible about as much as possible. Sarah’s passion for learning has found a home at RAIN, where she can learn and experiment as much as she pleases.
Meet Kira Boyce
A senior at Charles Wright Academy, Kira hopes to utilize her lab experience taken from RAIN by applying it to her own research this coming school year. She aspires to become a biomedical engineer and is always looking for a way to bring the team closer together. She is very passionate about music, cooking, and running, all of which she constantly tries to incorporate into her work at RAIN.
Meet Kian Croston
Kian is a second-year member of the Tacoma RAINmakers iGEM team. A truly experienced scientist, Kian’s entire aura exhibits calmness and control. Since his early days of research, Kian has been the absolute manifestation of flexibility. Versed in a multitude of talents, Kian transitions seamlessly between coding, wet lab, and technology. In his free time, Kian enjoys watching Khan Academy videos and drinking tea at eccentric cafes. Kian’s strong individual motivation coupled with a driving desire to learn will take him far in the realm of bioengineering and beyond.
Meet Ian Gutierrez
Ian is a senior at Stadium High School and does Running Start at Tacoma Community College. He is passionate about computers and hopes to pursue a career in computer science. Ian is apart of the wet lab team and the technology team and spends almost every day of the week at RAIN working in the lab or doing other projects. Ian hopes to gain more skills in the lab and possibly utilize them in the future. When Ian is not in the lab, he is also very passionate about photography and takes portraits of individuals and families often.
Meet Keshava Katti
Keshava is preparing for his second year of iGEM and has a enjoyed more than a year of wet lab work. As a high school junior, Keshava began with no pipetting skill, a nebulous concept of the central dogma, and an equally clueless understanding of PCR and gel electrophoresis. Today, he leads lab efforts that extend further than he could have ever dreamed, from fluorescent protein analysis to in vitro DNA extraction. Keshava will be attending the University of Pennsylvania in the fall and plans to double major in electrical engineering and mathematics. In the future, Keshava hopes to harness his understanding of synthetic biology for electrical engineering applications.
Meet James Lee
James, a rising senior in Charles Wright Academy, hopes to pursue his passion in science by being a part of RAIN’s iGEM team. With a strong interest in chemistry, James always finds a way to use his strengths by actively engaging in lab work and being on the tech team. He comes in almost everyday during the summer, not just to contribute to the team project, but also to meet people here who are the experts in science field and to hear about their experiences. James strives to pursue his passion in science in the future by majoring in biochemistry and joining the college research team.
Meet Michael Martin
Curiosity and desire to make a difference inspires Michael as he enters his Senior Year at Bellarmine Preparatory High School. Michael is a student who never gives up his pursuit of excellence and gives 100 percent effort toward learning. Michael has proven academically successful in college level classes and is hoping to bring something new to the table at RAIN. He is currently working on finding a better-functioning promoter sequence for the production of ArsR in the project design.
Meet Jaskiran Pental
As a rising senior at Annie Wright Schools, Jaskiran will enter her 14th year at the same school. Professionally and academically, Jaskiran’s interests lie in the field of bioengineering as it pertains to her natural curiosity towards understanding how things work in an interdisciplinary manner. Jaskiran hopes to delve into the sciences throughout college - this includes finding and learning from experiences within and surrounding STEM. After joining iGEM in the beginning of 2018, Jaskiran learned about the lab processes involved in cloning and now applies them to her work in the lab. She has gained many skills from spending hours in the lab and hopes to use these skills in her future research-oriented endeavors. Jaskiran also works on the Human Practices team, in which she works with other team members to find ways to spread awareness about who the Tacoma RainMakers are and what they do. Besides participating on the iGEM team, Jaskiran also loves to dance, contribute to her school community and spend time with friends and family.
Meet Leon Wan
Leon is a senior at Steilacoom High School who prefers to spend his time reading, being physically active, and eating. He also enjoys learning about STEM, which is a leading motivation in his involvement with the Tacoma RAINmakers team in 2018. This is his very first year participating in the iGEM competition, and although he struggles at times, he tries his best to help out in and outside the lab.
Meet Heidi Xu
Heidi is a CWA senior with a passion for learning and zesty tang for life. While she enjoys biology, she also loves art, history, and watching people make coffee art of shiba inus. She is excited that her involvement with RAIN means a greater level of proactivity in the community, and she hopes that her background in design can help enhance this year’s project.
Meet Madelyn Yeh
Madelyn Yeh, a senior at Charles Wright Academy, is a notable part of the wet lab and human practices team for the Tacoma RAINMakers. Her passion lies within the sciences, specifically the biological field. She hopes to use iGEM as a stepping stone into bioengineering with a hope of making a real impact on the world. Besides working in the lab, she enjoys learning new instruments, trying new types of food, and trying out new photoshop techniques. Intelligent, kind, and full of puns, she brightens up the lab and works hard while smiling and making others smile. One of the first of the team members to attain full lab independence, her keen intellect and drive make her an invaluable asset. The 2018 RAINMakers would not be the same without her, and she’s a blessing wherever she goes.
Meet Jonathan Zacarias
Driven by a love of learning and the people around him, Jonathan studies general engineering at the University of Redlands and seeks to apply his wide skill set in mechanics, electronics and the lab, as well as his “can-do” and supportive attitude, to his studies. Jonathan, as one of the four returning student members from RAIN’s 2017 IGEM team, leads the 2018 RAINMakers team as the technology subteam leader. This means he not only oversees the hardware for the team, but also the social media, app and wiki development. Bringing his experience from the last years team he has sought to prepare this years team as much as possible for competition.
