         sciNote Electronic Lab Notebook was first presented via Kickstarter, where we managed to reach our goal and officially launch this open source electronic lab notebook. A few months later, the team behind sciNote joined forces with Gilson Inc. and created sciNote LLC, which meant the beginning of a whole new chapter in the story of sciNote.

For us, our users are a continuous source of inspiration and growth. Only by working together and adapting to change, we can achieve continuous improvement and create the best open source electronic lab notebook.
