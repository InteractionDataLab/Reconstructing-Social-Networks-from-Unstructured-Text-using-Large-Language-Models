This is the area in our wiki dedicated to thanking everyone that really made this project and trip to Boston happen. Many institutions, companies and individuals have given us immense support and should be recognized. A very special thank you to RAIN Incubator for allowing us to use their labs and other facilities free of charge for this project, and a huge thank you to Judy Nguyen, our mentor and leader. Without her guidance and training there would really be no Tacoma RAINmakers.
During the 2018 competition, we successfully performed a wide array of tasks, including learning how to perform molecular cloning, coding an elegant wiki page, performing meaningful educational outreach events, conducting interviews with industry experts, and understanding how the arsenic sensor can help our community. It’s important that we recognize those who have helped our team so much.
