Parts Overview
The most significant hazard in the RAINmaker project would be the use of chemicals containing arsenic. Pure arsenic is not only toxic to humans, but it can also be highly toxic to aquatic life with lasting environmental and ecological effects. Sigma Aldrich warns that arsenic may also cause cancer. To work more safely, Tacoma RAINmakers used the sodium arsenate and sodium arsenite, which are the inorganic derivatives of arsenic that shows significantly less toxicity than the pure arsenic. When using sodium arsenate/sodium arsenite, Tacoma RAINmakers are engaging in a series of stringent safety practices. First, safety glasses will always be used to protect eyes. For hand protection, our team will wear nitrile gloves that equal or exceed required layer thickness (0.11mm). Contaminated gloves will be disposed of with proper glove removal technique (without touching glove's outer surface). To protect the body, our team will wear lab coats during all arsenic-related experiments. RAINmakers have considered air-purifying respirators, but have deemed this precaution unnecessary with proper lab technique use of a biosafety cabinet. Arsenic waste solutions or powder will not be allowed to enter drains or any location outside the lab.
