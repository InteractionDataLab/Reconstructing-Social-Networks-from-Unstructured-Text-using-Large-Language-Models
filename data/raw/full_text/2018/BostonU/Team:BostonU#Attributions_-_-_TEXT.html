Team
Kevin Lorch
In the lab, Kevin was responsible for yeast cell culture and transformation to build strains capable of expressing PhiReX and LOV2. He also worked on cloning the PhiReX parts into cassettes for integration into yeast. Later, he took on the role of eVOLVER tech, responsible for experimental preparation. Beyond the bench, he connected the team to Sustainability@BU and led the effort to create GreenGEM , a resource for documenting the team's sustainable practices and encouraging other teams to act sustainably. He also designed our color scheme!
Linda Luo
Linda helped clone the PhiReX cassettes. Outside of the lab, Linda worked on securing sponsorships for the team in addition to improving upon the VirEx STEM Pathways activity for middle and high schoolers. Furthermore, she contacted several other iGEM teams to help coordinate NEGEM, the iGEM meetup hosted at Boston University. Linda also designed Project Leo's logo. She also helped with experiment prep and ran eVOLVER experiments for our inducible systems. She worked on developing a method to test our colonies prior to use in eVOLVER experiments. Further, she was the main graphic designer for the team, and created most of the gifs and figures.
Cass Leach
Cass was responsible for data analysis and experimental design. She ran experiments for the team's participation in the InterLab study. Additionally, she worked on cloning PhiReX cassettes. Outside of the lab, Cass reached out to other iGEM teams for collaboration, including helping to plan and schedule NEGEM. Specifically, she worked with BostonU Hardware to create a serial dilution microfluidic chip. Later, Cass ran eVOLVER experiments and developed our model of gene expression patterns under different light pulsing inputs.
Mentors
Rachel Petherbridge
An iGEM alumna herself, Rachel advised the team on iGEM policies and practices, coaching us to success at the Jamboree. She also helped coordinate lab trainings with Marilene Pavan and Marisa Mendes to get the team in tip-top shape to begin lab work on May 23, and acted as a liasion with STEM Pathways. Furthermore, Rachel helped critique presentations, edit the wiki, and write grants for sponsorships.
Meghan Bragdon
Meghan mentored the team in lab skills and guided us through the development of our project. Currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student, Meghan is an expert in synthetic biology lab techniques. She also helped us workshop our presentation and hone our scientific communication skills. Meghan also helped refine our narrative for our wiki, presentation, and grant writing.
PIs
Dr. Ahmad (Mo) Khalil
Mo Khalil is the Innovation Career Development Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering, as well as the Associate Director of the Biological Design Center at Boston University. The Khalil Lab generously supported and hosted BostonU for the duration of our project. We are tremendously grateful for the mentorship Mo provided!
