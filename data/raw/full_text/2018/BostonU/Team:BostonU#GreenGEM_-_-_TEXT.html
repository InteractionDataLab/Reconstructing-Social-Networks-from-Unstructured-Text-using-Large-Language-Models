BostonU 2018 is tremendously excited about sustainable lab practices. Laboratories are massive consumers of energy and sources of waste production. Energy and resources are put to good use in the pursuit of science, but BostonU believes that it is our scientific responsibility to maximize efficient use of our planet's resources. In doing so, we not only can reduce our energy consumption, but can ensure our results are ironclad.
Here, we present GreenGEM, an online resource that builds upon the work of TU Dresden 2017, the makers of iGEM Goes Green . GreenGEM aggregates a collection of resources to generate a streamlined, user-friendly guide to implementing best practices for sustainable science. Many of the suggestions contained herein are chosen to minimize energy consumption and waste production while prioritizing robust scientific results.
Action Areas
After reaching out to Sustainability@BU and conducting a review of sustainable science literature, we compiled a list of sustainable actions for labs. We identified four Action Areas in which scientists can improve their environmental impact while preserving the quality of their results.
Equipment
Facilities
Contamination, Safety, and Chemical Use
