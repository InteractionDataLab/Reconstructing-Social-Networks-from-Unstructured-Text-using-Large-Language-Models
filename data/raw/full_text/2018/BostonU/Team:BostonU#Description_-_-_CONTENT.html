  Synthetic biology has a wide array of applications in bioproduction, with the design of engineered organisms to efficiently and inexpensive produce molecules of value<SUP>1</SUP>.
  Bioproduction at the industrial level is performed in bioreactors, apparatuses that maintain environments suitable for optimal microbial growth. A hallmark example of bioproduction is the engineering of
  <I>Saccharromyces cerevisiae</I> to produce the anti-malarial drug artemisinin<SUP>2</SUP>.
The use of budding yeast to synthesize artemisinin was a major breakthrough in synthetic biology, and established an inexpensive and sustainable  source of medicine to treat a major disease.
  
  However, many compounds produced in bioreactors require heterologous expression, in which a host organism is engineered to express a relevant exogenous gene borrowed  from nature. Unfortunately, heterologous expression can burden cells with high fitness costs resulting from production schemes or non-native compound outputs<SUP>3</SUP>.
  In response, production will plummet as cells either die off or break synthetic circuits to rescue fitness.
  <A style="color:dodgerBlue;">A major problem facing bioproduction is inefficiency due to failing or depleted engineered organisms.</A>
  Bioproduction is a powerful approach to ameliorating reliance on fossil fuels by offering inroads to large-scale  biofuel production. Specifically, exogenous expression of the well-studied enzyme xylose isomerase permits organisms that are otherwise unsuited to digest xylose, a sugar abundant in plant cell walls, towards the production of ethanol for biofuels.
  <I>Saccharromyces cerevisiae</I> is uniquely primed for producing ethanol, because its native high ethanol tolerance protects it from the potentially toxic effects of ethanol observed in other microbes<SUP>4</SUP>.
  However, the fitness costs associated with adequate heterologous expression of xylose isomerase in <I>S. cerevisiae</I> are so high that cells die before producing enough ethanol to be a viable source of biofuel.
  Thus, precise control of xylose isomerase expression is required for both the production and cell growth necessary for budding yeast to be a  significant source of  ethanol for biofuel.
</DIV><DIV class="description" style="font-size:20pt;">Inducible systems offer added control and can alleviate fitness costs</DIV><DIV class="description" style="float:left; margin: 10px; padding:0px 150px;">
  Inducible regulatory systems offer improved transcriptional control over constitutive expression. Located in promoter regions upstream of relevant genes, tunable inducible systems will initiate transcription exclusively  in response to  the proper stimulus.
  <A style="color:Crimson;">Inducible systems offer  temporal control of gene expression, alleviating fitness costs by tuning production to maximal levels without imposing growth defects.</A></DIV><DIV class="description" style="font-size:20pt;">Light Inducible Systems and Project Leo</DIV><DIV class="center" style="font-size:14pt;text-align:center;">
Figure 1: A diagram of a typical small molecule inducible system. The inducer is spiked into culture, diffuses into the cell, and binds to a transcription factor. This binding causes a conformational change in the transcription factor that allows it to bind in the promoter region and activate transcription. </DIV><DIV class="description" style="float:left; margin: 10px; padding:0px 150px;">
The current gold standard for transcriptional control relies on small molecule-inducible systems, in which exposure to a compound initiates transcription (an exceptional example is the estradiol-inducible system introduced by McIsaac et al in 2012<SUP>5</SUP>). However, small molecule-inducible systems have limitations to their use in synthetic biology applications. Because these systems rely on small molecules, inducibility in a culture relies on diffusion, which limits spatial control.  Molecule removal also requires time consuming, and often production-costly, wash steps to deplete the small molecule and deactivate transcription, limiting temporal control and output. Importantly, quantities of small molecules necessary at the industrial level come with costs too prohibitive for use in large-scale bioreactors.
<A style="color:dodgerBlue;">The limited spatiotemporal control inherent to small-molecule induction offers a layer of control over constitutive expression, but relies on molecules that may infer a fitness cost or prove expensive at industrial scales.</A></DIV><DIV class="center" style="font-size:14pt;text-align:center;">
  Figure 2: Small molecule inducible vs. light inducible systems. The flask on the left shows how inducers diffuse into culture while the flask on the right shows how light can easily be localized and rapidly switched on and off.
</DIV><DIV class="description" style="float:left; margin: 10px; padding:0px 150px;">
  Offsetting costs and improving control is accomplished with light-inducible systems, which are activated by specific pulses of light. Pulses can be easily localized and almost instantly activated or deactivated, providing superior spatiotemporal control<SUP>6,7</SUP>. While small molecule-inducible inputs are modeled by the slow curves of logarithmic activation and exponential deactivation, light-inducible inputs conform to the tight, crisp edges of square waves and step functions. Moreover, light apparatuses are cheaper than purchasing large amounts of inducer, lending light-inducible systems lower startup and maintenance costs which make them well suited for both small lab experiments and industrial-scale bioproduction.
</DIV><DIV class="center" style="font-size:14pt;text-align:center;">
Figure 3: Light inducible vs. Small molecule inducible input signals. The left side shows how light inputs can be easily switched on and off to form square waves and step functions, while the right illustrates how diffusion restricts input signals to logarithmic growth and exponential decay curves.
</DIV><DIV class="description" style="float:left; margin: 10px; padding:0px 150px;">
Despite offering more precise control for comparatively low cost, light inducible systems are insufficiently characterized, and the infrastructure necessary for light inducible systems is absent from most labs<SUP>8</SUP><A style="color:MediumOrchid;">With Project Leo, BostonU 2018 will characterize and optimize two light-inducible systems - LOV2, a blue-light activated system<SUP>9</SUP>,and PhiReX, a red-light activated system<SUP>10</SUP> - to improve transcriptional control.
  Xylose isomerase expression can then be tuned with light inducible systems to balance production and fitness in engineered yeast optimized for biofuel production.</A></DIV><DIV class="description" style="text-align:center;font-size:20pt;"><A href="Design">Click here to go to Design!</A></DIV><DIV class="description" style="font-size:20pt;"> References </DIV><DIV class="refs" style="padding:5px 150px; text-align:left;">
