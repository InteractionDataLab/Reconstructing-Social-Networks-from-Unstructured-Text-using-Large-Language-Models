Facilities
At first glance, one might think that facilities are not an area in which scientists can take action - short of a complete overhaul of their laboratory, the overall energy consumption would only be marginally affected. However, energy audits have shown that simple actions can reduce the energy consumption of a lab, save money, and minimize waste production.
#1: Shut the Sash!
Fume hoods use a great deal of energy to keep safe air circulating. Over the course of a year, a fume hood uses as much energy as 3.5 large U.S. households. [ 1 ] Shutting the sash can save up to 25% of that energy . In addition, shutting the sash helps keep lab spaces safe by preventing chemical fumes from escaping.
#2: Last One Out, Hit the Lights
Much like turning off lab equipment when not in use overnight, turning off overhead and bench lights when they aren't needed will save energy. BostonU's lab facilities have lights that include motion sensors and timers so that even if we forget to turn them off, they won't stay on all night. Moreover, scientists can advocate for sustainable architecture for labs: Natural light in lab spaces can reduce the need for lights during the day, and LED light bulbs use less energy and have a longer life span. Turning off lights when not in use can save up to 50% of energy consumed .
#3: Run Full Autoclave Cycles
A single autoclave cycle can consume up to 900 liters of water. [ 1 ] Furthermore, autoclaves typically use about 45 kWh of electricity per day - about the same as 2 large U.S. househoulds. [ 2 ] By coordinating with other lab members to consolidate autoclave cycles, we can reduce energy consumption and conserve water .
#4: Recycle!
Make sure that your lab has recycling streams for waste! Although pipet tips cannot be recycled, cardboard, paper, and some plastics are still recyclable. If your lab doesn't already have a dedicated recycling stream, get in touch with the coordinator of facilities to implement one. Recycling lab waste diverts waste from a landfill and contributes to establishing a sustainable waste stream .
#5: Turn Off The Autoclave
Autoclaves use 25,000 kWh per year - equivalent to two large households. Turning autoclaves off at night or over the weekend saves 60% of this energy consumption . This translates to saving $2,068 per autoclave. [ 3 ] Before you leave at night, double check that your autoclaves are off!
