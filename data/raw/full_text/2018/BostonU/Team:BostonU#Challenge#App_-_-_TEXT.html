Setting up the Sustainability@BU App
Having trouble figuring out how to set up the Sustainability@BU App?
No worries, we're here to help!
We'll take you step-by-step through the process of getting set up with the Sustainability@BU App, so that you can participate in the 2018 iGEM Sustainable Labs Challenge . The app is available on iPhone and on Android, just search for Sustainability@BU.
Installation
Once you find the Sustainability@BU app, you should come to a screen that looks like this.
Then, just hit install and the app will be set up on your home screen. Look for the green and white icon pictured here!
Getting Started
After the app is finished installing, you can open it to a screen that looks like this.
Then, you'll be prompted to login via email, Facebook, or Google. You can also continue without logging in, but then you won't be able to track your actions for the challenge.
Actions
After you've logged in, the app will bring you to the dashboard, which it will open to every time you open the app. The dashboard is also the Buzz tab, where you can buzz sustainable actions to earn points. The first time you open the app, the Newbie action will be highlighted to help get you acquainted with buzzing actions.
The basic idea is pretty easy to pick up - just tap on an action to learn about what it is, then tap the Buzz button to get points for the action. For example, if you shut the sash in your lab's fume hood, you can buzz the Shut the Sash action and get points!
Challenges
Once you're acquainted with the Buzz tab, you can click over to the challenges tab. There, you can see any challenges that are going on and compare yourself to the leaderboards!
You can also search for challenges by tapping the magnifying glass. If you're having trouble finding the iGEM Sustainable Labs Challenge , try searching for it!
iGEM Specifics
After getting all set up on the app and making sure you're able to buzz actions, search iGEM in the search bar. You should see two results: the 2018 iGEM Sustainability Challenge, and the iGEM community through the app.
The iGEM community will allow you to compare your lab's sustainable practices to other labs even after the challenge has ended! Just click the join button and make sure it switches to saying "Member" indicating that you've successfully joined the community.
Finally, join the 2018 iGEM Sustainability Challenge (once registration is open) by opening that result and tapping join challenge!
You can continue to explore the app on your own, but you should be all set for participating in the 2018 iGEM Sustainable Labs Challenge after reading this guide! Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
