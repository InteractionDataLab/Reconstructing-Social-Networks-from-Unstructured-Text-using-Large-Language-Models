May 20 - May 26:
Literature review of the current and past microfluidics
Brainstormed ideas of what the goal of the project would be and how we would accomplish it
Familiarized ourselves with the fabrication protocols and software tools (such as 3DuF) of the Boston University DAMP Lab
May 27 - June 2:
Milled and assembled an initial version of a 3 parallel droplet generator system
Tested and created our first droplets
Designed a continuous flow, single transposer chip
Started cell free master mix protocol for future use in proof of concept experiments
Milled and tested the single transposer chip
June 3 - June 9:
Finalized the idea for a automated system to streamline the output from the a microfluidic chip
Designed the initial version of a 3 parallel droplet generator/mixer system
Researched translational planes on the market for the active XY-plane
Created initial CAD files of parts for XY-plane
Became trained in a makerspace in Boston University
Manufactured prototypes of parts for the XY-plane
June 10 - June 16:
Researched various motors and decided to utilize stepper motors for the XY-plane and servo motors for the syringe pumps
Started designing chips with smaller feature sizes
Created a project description
Revised designs for the XY-plane supports in order to fit the stepper motors, timing belts, pulleys, and rods
Finished CAD files and CAM files for the XY-plane supports
June 17-23:
Designed, milled, and tested the 3 parallel droplet generation/mixer system chip with PEEK tubing in an effort to lower volume
Iterated through 17 milling/design attempts before deciding the extra time and effort going into chip preparation and stuck with standard port sizes
Learned how servo motors work and controlling via duty cycles
Purchased servo motors for control syringes
Ran initial programs on the stepper motors
Machined parts for the XY-plane and sent STL files to makerspace for 3D printing in order to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of the parts
June 24 - June 30:
Successfully created parallel streams of different mixed color droplets using the 3 parallel droplet generation/mixer with selector chip
Planed C++ classes to use for necessary control syringe software
Learned about WebSockets
Outlined flow of information from user to final motor action to plan data processing
Optimized PWM values for servo motors to hold each state
Ran tests to confirm that control syringes controlled by servo motors don’t cause leaky valves
Concluded that 3D printed parts must be made of ABS on the UPrint instead of resin on the Form2 does not allow for tight tolerances and accurate models
Created new CAD and STL files for 3D printing since the holes cannot be tapped and replaced them with clearance holes
Completed preliminary version of the Lab Safety form
July 1 - July 7:
Hosted and participated in the Northeastern iGEM (NEGEM) conference with the BostonU, UConn, Harvard, and MIT teams
Plan UI design using high-level flow charts and block diagrams
Plan how flow of information from user should move through UI
Learn web design (HTML5/CSS/Javascript/Bootstrap) to create UI
Refined the CAD models of the XY-plane
July 8 - July 14:
Started designing the serial dilution chips for BostonU Wetlab collaboration
Milled a ran a mixer test chip
