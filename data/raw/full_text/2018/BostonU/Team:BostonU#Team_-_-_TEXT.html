Kevin Lorch
Yeast Ace
Ice/Grass-type Trainer. Kermit the Frog. "She busted"Kevin is a senior in Biomedical Engineering at BU! Kevin is a Gemini, so naturally he enjoys throwing shade, getting weird looks around lab for sniffing blocks, and spreading the word that the Domino's pizza tracker is fake. Dislikes include hot weather, Virgos, and when his yeast dies.

Rachel Petherbridge
Policy Tycoon
Always Hangry. Post Fringe Bangs Phase. "Man, I used to be able to kick my face."Rachel is a senior in Biomedical Engineering and is returning to iGEM as a mentor after being part of the BostonU 2016 team! Originally from North Carolina, Rachel is full of stories infused with Southern charm. Rachel is an Aries, and true to form, she is always hangry. The only cure is to feed her strawberries, a fact which inspired one of her former teammates to  compare her to a small deer. Also enjoys hiking and IPAs. Dislikes bullet points.
