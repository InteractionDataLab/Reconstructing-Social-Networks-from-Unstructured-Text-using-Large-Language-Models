2018 iGEM Sustainable Labs Challenge
Welcome to the 2018 iGEM Sustainable Labs Challenge!
The 2018 iGEM Sustainable Labs Challenge is over!
Thank you to all teams that participated!
Hosted by BostonU in conjunction with Sustainability@BU, the 2018 iGEM Sustainable Labs Challenge is designed to introduce iGEM teams to environmentally-friendly lab practices and help young scientists form sustainable habits.
Targeting three major areas in which labs could reduce their impact, teams participating in the challenge tracked, or buzzed, actions via the Sustainability@BU app ( For a guide to setting up the app, click here ) and earned points for engaging in sustainable lab practices. All of the actions are still there, so you can track your impact in the lab after the challenge!
Not sure how to make your lab more sustainable? Have a look at GreenGEM , BostonU's online repository of sustainable lab practices. Many of the practices detailed in GreenGEM were used to create the list of actions for the challenge, so it's a great place to start learning about sustainable lab habits.
Everyone loves to win a prize! All participating teams in the Sustainable Labs Challenge won a small succulent plant, while the winning team earned an aloe plant. Each prize comes with a clay pot decorated by BostonU! Succulents are low maintenance, easy to travel with, and will brighten up your lab space. Teams can pick up their prize from BostonU at the Giant Jamboree
