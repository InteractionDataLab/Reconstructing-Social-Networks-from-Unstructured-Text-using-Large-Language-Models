Submitted Parts
Using the Modular Cloning scheme described in Design , BostonU was able to create an array of parts to characterize the use of our light-inducible systems. Then, we submitted the parts that demonstrated optimal expression as BioBricks. The table below describes our BioBricks, which can be found in the registry here .

Description
BBa_K2805002
(C120op)x5-minCyc1-mRuby2-tCyc1
This is an mRuby reporter driven by a LOV2-compatible blue light-inducible promoter
BBa_K2805003
LOV2: NLS-VP16-EL222
This is a gene for expressing LOV2, a blue light-inducible transcription activator that binds to C120op sites (such as the promoter in BBa_K2805002).
BBa_K2805004
LOV2->mRuby
This is a composite of the two parts above, BBa_K2805002 and BBa_K2805003. When integrated into yeast, cells will express mRuby when bathed in blue (450 nm) light.
BBa_K2805005
PhyBNT-Zif268
This part is a red light-inducible transcription activator for the PhiReX system. It will not work without the addition of chromophores PCB and PÎ¦B, which are not native to S. cerevisiae. Links to these chromophores in the registry may be found on the registry page for this part
BBa_K2805006
PIF3-NLS-VP16
The helix-loop-helix protein PIF3 linked to an NLS and the VP16 transcriptional activator. This is piece of the PhiReX system which dimerizes with PhyBNT when PhyBNT is induced by red (650 nm wavelength) light.
BBa_K2805007
pGal1(Zif268op)x6-mRuby2
This is an mRuby red fluorescent protein driven by a mutated pGal1 promoter with 6 Zif268 zinc finger binding sites. This part is mean to be used in conjunction with BBa_K2805005 and BBa_K2805006. When used with BBa_K2805005 and BBa_K2805006, mRuby will express under red (650 nm wavelength) light.
BBa_K2805008
PhiReX -> mRuby
A composite of BBa_K2805005, BBa_K2805006 and BBa_K2805007, using PhiReX to drive mRuby expression.
BBa_K2805009
HY1
A heme oxygenase enzyme for non-natively expressing the chromophores required for PhyBNT-Zif268 to work.
BBa_K2805010
{pPGK1-HY1}-{pTEF1-PcyA}
All of the enzymes needed for non-natively expressing the PhiReX system chromophores.
BBa_K2805012
(C120op)x5-vioC
LOV2-binding promoter driving vioC. For more information on vioC, see iGEM 2016 Washington's registry page on the part.
BBa_K2805013
LOV2 -> vioC
LOV2 blue light-inducible promoter system for toggling expression of vioC. Composite of BBa_K2805003: LOV2: NLS-VP16-EL222 and BBa_K2805012: (C120op)x5-vioC.
Additional information, including characterization data, may be found on each part's registry pages, or on this wiki.
