Safety
We worked in a BSL2 lab at Boston University, which required each team member to complete the RIMS (Research Information Management System) program specific to our safety level. In addition, all members of the BostonU team went through preliminary lab training through STEM Pathways in the CIDAR Lab at Boston University before beginning lab work in the Khalil Lab, where they were again trained in safe lab work.
We used BSL1 bacteria and budding yeast to incorporate our two light inducible systems, LOV2 and PhiReX, into yeast strains. We are using E.coli-TG1 for molecular cloning and S.cerevisiae-yPH500 for the final expression of our genes of interest. The TG1 strain is derivative of the E.coli-K-12 strain. In addition, there are several in-lab strains of yeast we are using, which are all daughter strains of yPH500. We are working with and building recombinant organisms.
After growth in incubators, plates were parafilmed and placed in the cold room, and a library stock of liquid culture was mixed with 50% glucose and  stored as glycerol stocks in the -80 degrees Celsius freezer. Remaining liquid culture was bleached with 10% bleach and poured down the sink. When disposing of solid biological waste, waste was placed in either the biohazard bins or sharps boxes around the lab.
While in the lab, all team members wore the appropriate personal protection equipment, including pants, closed toed shoes, lab coats, and gloves.
