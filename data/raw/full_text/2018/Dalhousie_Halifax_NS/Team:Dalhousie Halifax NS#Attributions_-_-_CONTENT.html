dedicated people. We would like to take the chance to thank these people here for all of their help. It
really means a lot to us.<CENTER><H2><FONT color="#F9B96E">2018 Team and Project</FONT></H2></CENTER><P>The recruitment for the 2018 team flowed continuously from the 2017 project building interest in possible members through presentations and in class informational sessions. Applications for members were due by January 31st and interviews were held during the month of February. March held general meetings to inform new members about iGEM as a whole as well as the 2017 project. During this month team members researched and proposed project ideas that were brainstormed in small groups until the team decided on a project. Originally the project was based in using transposon sequencing, which we later had to shift to a biosynthetic pyoverdine pathway, however the focus was always on improving aluminum toxicity measurement procedures. At the beginning of April our team consisted of 15 undergraduate students, 4 graduate mentors and 2 faculty advisors. Team leads were nominated in June for Wet Lab, Dry Lab, Human Practices, Fundraising and Interlab teams. May and June had the teams developing goals, running training workshops and outlining our sponsorship package. We also assigned individuals to keep our social media pages update over the course of our project. Team members were kept busy during our planning and training months and continuing over the course of the summer by participating in our science communication PLOSibilities blog. June also had the wet lab and dry lab team members looking at gene block design for the biosynthetic pathway genes of our project. From July until October members were heavily involved in our cloning procedures testing multiple gene blocks with lots of troubleshooting getting creative with different ways we could characterize our biobrick.
