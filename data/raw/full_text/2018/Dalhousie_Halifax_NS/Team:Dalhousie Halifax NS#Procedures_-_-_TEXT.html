Protocols
DNA Digest
Using restriction enzymes to cleave framents of DNA. Often used in cloning and verifying the insertion.
Gel Electrophoresis
Used to separate DNA on the basis of size. After Digestion, this lets us see how big our segements.
Ligation
Used to join inserts into a vector. Requires cloning after to seal "nicks" in the back bone.
Agrose Gel
The gel used in DNA electrophoresis.
Heat Shock Transfromation
We use heat to introduce small pores in the bacterial membrane to allow our DNA constructs to enter the cell
Batch Culture
Growing colonies in liquid media after cloning
