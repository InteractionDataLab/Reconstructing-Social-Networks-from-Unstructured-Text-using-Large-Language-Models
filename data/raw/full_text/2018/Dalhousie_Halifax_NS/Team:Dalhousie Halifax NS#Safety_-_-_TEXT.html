General Safety Procedures
Prior to beginning lab work all team members completed WHIMIS and Biosafety training from the Public Health Agency of Canada. These courses were administered online and emphasized biosafety, decontamination techniques, safety within containment labs and PPE.  Our team followed lab safety procedures by always wearing PPE while in the lab, including lab coats, gloves and safety goggles.  Our team received autoclave training so we could properly dispose of all chemical waste produced within the laboratory at Dalhousie UNiversity.
Safety Equipment
Our lab contains:
3 fire extinguishers
1 spill kit
3 eyewash stations
1 safety shower
1 fire alarm
1 main propane shut off
Project specific safety procedures
All lab members attended or lab bootcamp weekend which included workshops on all necessary lab techniques taught by our mentors.Technique specific safety measures were also accounted for as follows:  Operating a UV light box: Our project required the use of a UV light box to visualize the PCR product for cloning. Training on how to use the UV light box was essential to avoid burns and over exposure that might lead to cancer. Bunsen burners: Aseptic techniques were required for sterile bacterial growth. Members only turned on the gas of the Bunsen burners when necessary and turned off when done. All bench top propane valves were checked and closed before main propane valve was opened. All flammable materials were kept away from the Bunsen burner and personal protective equipment where worn at all times.
