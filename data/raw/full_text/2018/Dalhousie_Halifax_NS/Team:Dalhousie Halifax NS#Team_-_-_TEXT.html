Our Team
Francis Routledge
3rd year of Neuroscience and Neurotechnology.
My Role: Co-president (ZENTS!). Involved with Human Practices, Wet lab, and Bioinformatics.
Motivation: I liked the multidisciplinary side of iGEM projects, emulating the interconnectedness of research, innovation, ethics, business, and outreach. I also love the iGEM community and wanted to continue being a part of such an open and fun group of people who are passionate about science!
Fun Fact: Aside from my major, some of my favorite courses at Dalhousie have all been about music. I love live music and I play guitar and sing in my free time.
Matthew Curry
Third year of Microbiology and Immunology
My Role: I am one of the two Co-Pressidents of this year’s team. This means I help the sub-teams work together and keep us on schedule!
Motivation: After having so much fun working on our 2017 team’s cellulose project I had to come back! Ever since I became involved with iGEM I’ve had a growing interest in biotechnology and genetic engineering. Being involved with the 2018 team is also keeping me up to date with recent advances in microbial      genetics!
Fun Fact:  I will always pick up cats, even though I am allergic to them!
Elmira Farrashzadeh
My Role: I work mainly with the wetlab team in developing and carrying out our project, along with the human practices team.
Motivation: I was motivated to join iGEM after hearing about the team and learning more about the promising future of synthetic biology. Being afforded the opportunity to work in a team of like-minded people who are passionate about making a change with synthetic biology was something I couldn’t refuse.
Fun Fact: In my spare time I like to paint, ski, and play the piano. I’m the kind of person who will make and laugh at corny science jokes. I hope to pursue a career as a dentist, but I would love to somehow incorporate research into my job as well.
Taylor Caddell
I am going into my third year studying microbiology and immunology.
My Role: I am a member of the wet lab and bioinformatics teams for Dalhousie’s iGEM team.
Motivation: I decided to join iGEM because it is a great opportunity to meet like-minded peers from different fields of study as well as gain useful skills in a fun environment.
Fun Fact: My decision to study microbiology and immunology in university was entirely based on my love/fear of Ebola and my life long goal of wearing a Hazmat suit.
Mairin Hogan
fourth year Medical Sciences student at Dalhousie University.
My Role: Currently, I am a member of the wetlab team and running our Twitter page (follow us at Dalhousie_iGEM).
Motivation: I was introduced to the concept of synthetic biology during my second-year at Dalhousie. The concept of combining the fields of engineering and biology to design solutions to real-world problems was extremely interesting to me. Thus, I joined iGEM team to have first-hand experience in this quickly evolving branch of biology!
Fun Fact: I’ve volunteered with Habitat for Humanity since 2014. I also sleep talk – A LOT!
Catherine Robertson
I am a third-year biochemistry student with a minor in biology.
My Role: I am involved in the wet lab and fundraising
Motivation: I am really interested in genetics and wanted to be in a project like this, where I was able to get hands on experience in a lab and conducting research. I also like the team aspect, and its fun to be able to work with my peers.
Fun Fact: : I am a Canadian and English citizen and have lived in the UK for most of my life and I came to Halifax for my first  year of university.
Vicky Haines
Third year, Microbiology and Immunology
My Role: My role for this years iGem team is to help out in as many ways as I can as this is my first year participating in this. I am currently active on the wetlab team and the human practices team and would love to help out with fundraising. I am also head of the facebook page and work with the other social media leaders to create a fun and informative online presence.
Motivation: I joined iGEM because I think there are so many possibilities with regards to genetics and it would be amazing to be a part of something that could make a difference. Especially since we are working to help the Nova Scotian salmon population.
Fun Fact: I used to play volleyball competitively and helped coach 6-12 year old girls.
Andrea Tomko
Third year of the Medical Sciences program.
I am part of both the wet lab and human practices teams this year.
I decided to join the Dalhousie iGEM team this year because I think it’s a great opportunity to gain new skills inside and outside of the lab and wanted to push myself to think outside of the box.
A fun fact about me is that I love antiques, especially furniture and jewelry

Mentors
Landon Getz
My name is Landon Getz and i'm in the first year of my Ph.D. program in Microbiology at Dalhousie, studying _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ ' Environmental Survival and Host Pathogen Interactions.  I am a mentor for Dalhousie iGEM because I believe that providing undergraduate students with valuable, hands-on, skills is important for making sure they leave their degree's prepared for life in both academia and industry. iGEM makes sure that students in the biological sciences are well prepared for both. Fun Fact: I am an avid bread baker and an experienced gardener, experimenting constantly with different bread recipes and spending many summer weekends at the Dalhousie Urban Garden.

Emma Finlayson-Trick
Emma has been part of the Dalhousie iGEM team for three years and has enjoyed watching the team develop into what it is today. She first got involved with iGEM to learn more about synthetic biology and to gain lab experience. Emma is pursuing her master’s degree in microbiology and immunology studying the NOD2 protein in the context of Crohn’s disease.
Mackenzie Thornbury
Mackenzie is in her 5th (and final!) year of her undergrad in Microbiology and Immunology. She joined iGEM two years ago to learn about what synthetic biology is, and how she could get involved in this emerging field. The iGEM 2016 Jamboree not only inspired Mackenzie to come back for 2017, but encouraged her to help cement Dalhousie iGEM’s place in Dal’s programming. She is grateful to be apart of this amazing program which grants undergraduate students priceless training and offers incredible opportunities. Mackenzie finishes her degree in December and plans to take a short breather before entering Graduate Studies in September 2018.
Faculty Advisors
Dr. John Rhode
Dr. Rohde is a geneticist who founded the Dalhousie iGEM team in 2015. He received his training in genetics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems at institutions that include University of British Columbia, Duke Medical Center and Institut Pasteur. His interest in synthetic biology arose from discussions in the Dalhousie classrooms where he teaches microbial genetics.
Dr. Craig McCormmick
Craig McCormick is a Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Dalhousie University, where he studies the interactions between viruses and cells. In his first year as an iGEM faculty mentor, he worked closely with the team to promote iGEM as an innovative model of student-led, interdisciplinary undergraduate training. His vision is that Dalhousie iGEM will gain a reputation as a magnet for talented, ambitious students, who will gain leadership and communication skills that will prepare them to lead the synthetic biology revolution.
