Our Team
Francis Routledge
3rd year Neuroscience and Neurotechnology.
My Role: Co-president (ZENTS!). Involved with Human Practices, Wet lab, and Bioinformatics.
Motivation: I liked the multidisciplinary side of iGEM projects, emulating the interconnectedness of research, innovation, ethics, business, and outreach. I also love the iGEM community and wanted to continue being a part of such an open and fun group of people who are passionate about science!
Fun Fact: Aside from my major, some of my favorite courses at Dalhousie have all been about music. I love live music and I play guitar and sing in my free time.
Matthew Curry
3rd year Microbiology and Immunology
My Role: I am one of the two Co-Pressidents of this year’s team. This means I help the sub-teams work together and keep us on schedule!
Motivation: After having so much fun working on our 2017 team’s cellulose project I had to come back! Ever since I became involved with iGEM I’ve had a growing interest in biotechnology and genetic engineering. Being involved with the 2018 team is also keeping me up to date with recent advances in microbial      genetics!
Fun Fact:  I will always pick up cats, even though I am allergic to them!
Elmira Farrashzadeh
3rd year Microbiology and Immunology
My Role: I am a co-lead of the wet lab team and work mainly in developing and carrying out our project. I am also a part of the human practices team.
Motivation: I was motivated to join iGEM after hearing about the team and learning more about the promising future of synthetic biology. Being afforded the opportunity to work in a team of like-minded people who are passionate about making a change with synthetic biology was something I couldn’t refuse.
Fun Fact: In my spare time I like to paint, ski, and play the piano. I’m the kind of person who will make and laugh at corny science jokes. I hope to pursue a career as a dentist, but I would love to somehow incorporate research into my job as well.
Taylor Caddell
3rd year Microbiology and Immunology.
My Role: I am a member of our bioinformatics team and am the lead for the wet lab team.
Motivation: I decided to join iGEM because it is a great opportunity to meet like-minded peers from different fields of study as well as gain useful skills in a fun environment.
Fun Fact: My decision to study microbiology and immunology in university was entirely based on my love/fear of Ebola and my life long goal of wearing a Hazmat suit.
Mairin Hogan
4th year Medical Sciences
My Role: Currently, I am InterLab team lead as well as running our fundraising team. I also run our Twitter page (follow us at Dalhousie_iGEM!).
Motivation: I was introduced to the concept of synthetic biology during my second-year at Dalhousie. The concept of combining the fields of engineering and biology to design solutions to real-world problems was extremely interesting to me. I joined iGEM team to have first-hand experience in this quickly evolving branch of biology!
Fun Fact: I’ve volunteered with Habitat for Humanity since 2014. I also sleep talk – A LOT!
Catherine Robertson
3rd year Biochemistry with a minor in Biology.
My Role: I am involved in the wet lab and fundraising
Motivation: I am really interested in genetics and wanted to be in a project like this, where I was able to get hands on experience in a lab and conducting research. I also like the team aspect, and its fun to be able to work with my peers.
Fun Fact: : I am a Canadian and English citizen and have lived in the UK for most of my life and I came to Halifax for my first  year of university.
Vicky Haines
3rd year Microbiology and Immunology
My Role: My role for this years iGEM team is to help out in as many ways as I can as this is my first year participating in this. I am currently active on the wetlab team and the human practices team and would love to help out with fundraising. I am also head of the facebook page and work with the other social media leaders to create a fun and informative online presence.
Motivation: I joined iGEM because I think there are so many possibilities with regards to genetics and it would be amazing to be a part of something that could make a difference. Especially since we are working to help the Nova Scotian salmon population.
Fun Fact: I used to play volleyball competitively and helped coach 6-12 year old girls.
Andrea Tomko
3rd year Medical Sciences
My Role:I am part of both the wet lab and human practices teams this year.
Motivation:I decided to join the Dalhousie iGEM team this year because I think it’s a great opportunity to gain new skills inside and outside of the lab and wanted to push myself to think outside of the box.
Fun Fact: I love antiques, especially furniture and jewelry
Jocelyn MacDonald
3rd year Biochemistry and Computer Science
My Role: I am co-leading the bioinformatics team and I am a part of the web design and wet lab teams.
Motivation: After hearing about iGEM I became interested in synthetic biology and wanted to learn more. iGEM me the chance to combine my two majors and see how they can work together.
Fun Fact: I will point out every dog I see on the street and will always laugh at any science pun.
Hannah Leblanc
3rd year, Mechanical Engineering
My Role: I am co-leading the bioinformatics team as well as working on the web design and wet lab teams.
Motivation: I joined iGEM to broaden my academic experiences and to meet/work with people from a lot of different backgrounds than I’m used to.
Fun Fact: I’m really good at crocheting rectangles and circles
Jennifer Allott
May 2018 graduate, Combined Honours Biology and Contemporary Studies
My Role: I am a part of the wet lab team.
Motivation: joined iGEM because I missed being in a lab and wanted to get involved in hands-on scientific research.
Fun Fact: I have been salsa dancing in Halifax for four years
Mentors
Landon Getz
Landon Getz is an Ph.D. Candidate here at Dalhousie and is a Graduate Student mentor for iGEM Dalhousie 2018. Landon attended the Giant Jamboree in 2016 and has experience with the iGEM competition and what is expected at the Jamboree. Landon was apart of the bioinformatics and web design team member last year, and can guide Dalhousie iGEM this year through these processes. He got involved with iGEM in 2016 to learn new skills and work with other like-minded individuals on a group project. This year, Landon is hoping to pass off the skills he learned to the new students of iGEM 2019. For the future, he is hoping to continue in academia or use his synthetic biology background to aid in ocean biotechnology innovation.
Gavin Douglas
2nd year PhD student in the department of Microbiology & Immunology.
My Role:Bioinformatics team mentor
Motivation:To be involved in interesting synthetic biology research and develop my mentoring skills!
Fun Fact: I have 8.75 toes
Emma Finlayson-Trick
Emma has been part of the Dalhousie iGEM team for three years and has enjoyed watching the team develop into what it is today. She first got involved with iGEM to learn more about synthetic biology and to gain lab experience. Emma is pursuing her master’s degree in microbiology and immunology studying the NOD2 protein in the context of Crohn’s disease.
Mackenzie Thornbury
Mackenzie is in her 5th (and final!) year of her undergrad in Microbiology and Immunology. She joined iGEM two years ago to learn about what synthetic biology is, and how she could get involved in this emerging field. The iGEM 2016 Jamboree not only inspired Mackenzie to come back for 2017, but encouraged her to help cement Dalhousie iGEM’s place in Dal’s programming. She is grateful to be apart of this amazing program which grants undergraduate students priceless training and offers incredible opportunities. Mackenzie finishes her degree in December and plans to take a short breather before entering Graduate Studies in September 2018.
Faculty Advisors
Dr. John Rhode
Dr. Rohde is a geneticist who founded the Dalhousie iGEM team in 2015. He received his training in genetics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems at institutions that include University of British Columbia, Duke Medical Center and Institut Pasteur. His interest in synthetic biology arose from discussions in the Dalhousie classrooms where he teaches microbial genetics.
Dr. Craig McCormmick
Craig McCormick is a Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Dalhousie University, where he studies the interactions between viruses and cells. In his first year as an iGEM faculty mentor, he worked closely with the team to promote iGEM as an innovative model of student-led, interdisciplinary undergraduate training. His vision is that Dalhousie iGEM will gain a reputation as a magnet for talented, ambitious students, who will gain leadership and communication skills that will prepare them to lead the synthetic biology revolution.
