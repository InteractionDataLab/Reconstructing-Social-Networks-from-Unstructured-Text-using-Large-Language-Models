Repressible promoter for the vanillate operon
Terminal oxygenase (VanA) is a promoter expressed in the vanillate operon by Caulobacter crescentus and is used by the bacteria to express genes for breaking down vanillate. Our idea for VanA was to use it to create an expression system along with the repressor component of the same system, VanR. In the presence of vanillate, the system should express any genes cloned downstream of the promoter.
