Transforming E. Coli Rosetta for pRED/ET Engineering
2018/06/04
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Chemical transformation
Notes:
Inoculate pRED at 30Â°C because of temperature sensitive promoter.
Results:
No colonies. We decided to redo the experiment with another pRED plasmid from PD Dr. Sandra Sagredo from the Simmel lab.
Redo: Transforming E. Coli Rosetta for pRED/ET Engineering
2018/06/08
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Chemical Transformation
Notes:
We used a different pRED/ET plasmid from PD Dr. Sandra Sagredo from the ZNN.
Results:
No colonies. We decided to redo the experiment by electroporation.
Redo:Transforming E. Coli Rosetta for pRED/ET Engineering
2018/06/12
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Restriction digest
Notes:
We used a different pRED/ET plasmid from PD Dr. Sandra Sagredo from the ZNN.
Results:
No colonies. pRED/ET engineering seems to not work in Rosetta. We postponed this experiment to do it with PD Dr. Lassak at the LMU again.
