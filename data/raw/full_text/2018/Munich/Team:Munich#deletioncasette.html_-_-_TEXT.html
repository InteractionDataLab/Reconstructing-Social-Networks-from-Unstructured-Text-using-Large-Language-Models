Amplifying a Selection Cassette from pSB1C3

Participants:
Enikö Baligács
Protocol:
PCR , Agarose gel , Gel extraction
Notes:
PCR with two primer pairs were tested to amplify a chloramphenicol resistance cassette for the knockout. Both pairs have a 50 bp overhang homology region to the knockout target in E.Coli genomes. One pair has longer annealing sequence (CAT_RecBCD-KO_5HA_long_rv  and CAT_RecBCD-KO_5HA_long_fw) and the other pair shorter. (CAT_RecBCD-KO_5HA_short_rv  and CAT_RecBCD-KO_5HA_short_fw).
Results:
We thought the band might be what we wanted but because of how few DNA the extraction yielded, these samples were not used in further experiments.
