T7 and T4 DNA Purification with Phage DNA Isolation Kit
2018/07/25- 2018/08/02
Participants:
Brigit Tunaj
Protocol:
DNA Cleanup Kit , Phage T7 DNA purification
Notes:
DNAse I treatment and Proteinase K treatment
Results:

T7, T4 and 3S Stock Preparation and Cleanup
2018/08/20
Participants:
Brigit Tunaj
Protocol:
DNA Cleanup Kit , Phage T7 DNA purification
Notes:
DNAse treatment
Results:
Good enough for DNA Assembly but not for Sequencing. Therefore new cleaning up methods have been tried out by talking with Quirin and Kilian
