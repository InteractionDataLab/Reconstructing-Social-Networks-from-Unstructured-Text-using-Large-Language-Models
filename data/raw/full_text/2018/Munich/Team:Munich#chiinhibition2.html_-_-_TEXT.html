Amplify and Linearize mTurq2_MGaptamer
2018/08/07
Participants:
Katja Neishsalo
Protocol:
PCR , Restriction digest
Notes:
For in vitro tests we used pSB1C3_mRFP. However RFP is not suited for expression in cell extract. Therefore we got mTurq2 with an MGaptamer from another laboratory sub-team. This was linearized and amplified by PCR. Consequently, the template was digested by DpnI.
Inhibition of RecBCD with Chi6 Oligomer in Cell Extract
2018/08/07
Participants:
Katja Neishsalo
Protocol:
Cell extract expression
Results:
No inhibition of RecBCD activity observed.
Testing Chi6 Inhibitor from pSB1C3_Chi6 in Cell Extract
2018/09/05
Participants:
Katja Neishsalo
Protocol:
PCR , PCR purification , cell extract expression
Results:
Didnt work. Thomas (supervisor) suspected that the linear DNA wasnt expressing properly and GamS may be denatured.

Testing if GamS Inhibitor is Still Potent
2018/09/12
Participants:
Katja Neishsalo
Protocol:
cell extract expression
Notes:
mTurqouise expression in cell extract to confirm GamS activity.
Results:
GamS works.
Inhibition of RecBCD with Chi6 Oligomer in Cell Extract
2018/09/16
Participants:
Katja Neishsalo
Protocol:
cell extract expression
Results:
General expression levels were really low. The inhibition worked but results are very similar to those of GamS. More experiments have to be done here, but the focus of the experiement shifted towards phages. Therefore, we didnt continue working on this.
