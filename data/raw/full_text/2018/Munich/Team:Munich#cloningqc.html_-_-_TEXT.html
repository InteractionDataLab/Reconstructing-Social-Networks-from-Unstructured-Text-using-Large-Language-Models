Assembling pSB1C3_Mtq2_MGaptamer
2018/06/04 - 2018/06/12
Participants:
Sophie Schönberg von Schönberg, Ariane Krus, Katie Wong, Franziska Winzig
Protocol:
PCR , Ligation , Chemical transformation , Colony PCR , Restriction digest , Miniprep
Notes:
Overhang PCR to insert Malachite Green Aptamer into the 3' end of mTurq CDS
04.06.18: DpnI Digest, Phosphorylation of 5’ ends, Ligation
06.06.18: Transformation of ligation products into DH5α chemically competent cells
08.06.18: Colony PCR and gel
11.06.18: Overnight culture with 2 colonies
12.06.18: Miniprep
Sent for sequenzing
Results:
mTurq worked.
Plasmid was assembled correctly. mTurq fluorescent signal can be recorded in  TX-TL tests. Malachite green aptamer has no signal in TX-TL test because unwanted hybridization to mTurq CDS appears (NUPACK result). We decided to protect the aptamer by inserting a secondary structure (3-way-junction motif).

Notes:
04.06.18: Overhang PCR to insert Malachite Green Aptamer into the 3' UTR of mTurq plasmide
04.06.18: DpnI Digest, Phosphorylation of 5’ ends, Ligation

Sent for sequenzing
Results:
Plasmid was assembled correctly, but a point mutation was detected in the MG aptamer. This prevents the binding of the Malachite Green into the aptamer binding pocket. mTurq fluorescent signal can be recorded in  TX-TL tests.
