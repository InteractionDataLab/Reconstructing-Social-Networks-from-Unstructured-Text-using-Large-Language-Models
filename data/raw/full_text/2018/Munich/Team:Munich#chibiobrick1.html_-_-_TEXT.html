2018/06/01
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Oligodimerization
Notes:
Oligodimers were bought
Assembling pSB1C3_Chi6 with A3 Assembly
2018/06/04
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Restriction digest , Ligation , Chemical transformation , Miniprep , Sequencing
Notes:
pSB1C3 Backbone was generated by restriction with XbaI and SpeI. Chi6 Dimers were digested with XbaI & SpeI.
Transformation of Dh5a
Results:
No sequence obtained for the given primers. The samples must be contaminated. We decided to redo the experiment.
Redo: Assembling pSB1C3_Chi6 with A3 Assembly
2018/06/06 - 2018/06/26
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Restriction digest , PCR purification , Ligation , Chemical Transformation , PCR , Agarose gel
Notes:
Digest with XbaI, SpeI
Transformation of Dh5a
Results:
No bands on the Gel. Colonies on the plate resulted from contamination (religation of backbound).
