In Vitro Inhibition of RecBCD with Chi6 Oligomers
2018/06/15
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Agarose gel , Restriction digest , Exonuclease V reaction
Notes:
Reaction was stoppedat at 10µl (50mM (2,82µl)) with EDTA (11mM), then heated on 70°C for 30 minutes.
Results:
Linear DNA was not degraded: we found out later that RecBCD was expired, but a positive control was missing.

Participants:
Enikö Baligács
Protocol:
Agarose gel , Restriction digest , Exonuclease V reaction
Notes:
The experiment was repeated by Enikö Baligács and a positive control was added.
Results:
Linear DNA was not degraded: We found out that RecBCD was expired and not functional.

Protocol:
Agarose gel , Restriction digest , Exonuclease V reaction
Notes:
No notes
Results:
The Agarose gel was prepared wrong. Therefore, samples were lost and could not be evaluated.

2018/08/02
Participants:
Enikö Baligács, Julia Mayer
Protocol:
Agarose gel , Restriction digest , Exonuclease V reaction
Notes:
The experiment was repeated with newly ordered recBCD.
Digested Backbone was Stored.
Results:
Chi6 oligomers inhibit RecBCD but are degraded within 30 minutes. We went on to show these results in cell extract.
