T7 and 3S DNA Purification with Two Phenol Chloroform Precipitation
2018/09/03- 2018/09/06
Participants:
Brigit Tunaj
Protocol:
DNA purification , Phenol-Chloroform Precipitation , Agarose Gel electrophoresis , Gel extraction
Notes:
DNAse I treatment, DNA extraction from gel trying to solve it in water over the night
Results:
Second Phenol chloroform precipitation was not successful, because the DNA extraction from agarose did not work out.  Kilian tried it out in dissolving buffer from Gel extraction kit and water but did not work out neither
T7, T4 and 3S DNA Purification with Phenol Chloroform Precipitation and Kit
2018/09/17- 2018/09/20
Participants:
Brigit Tunaj
Protocol:
DNA purification , Phenol-Chloroform Precipitation , Agarose Gel electrophoresis , Gel extraction
Notes:
DNAse I treatment, DNA extraction from gel trying to solve it in 1xTBE + 100mM NaCl Buffer (recommended by Lukas O.), and then Phenol chloroform precipitation and/or kit used
Results:
Second Phenol chloroform precipitation/Kit usage was not successful, because the DNA extraction from agarose did not work out. Problem is to remove the agarose from the sample (Gel extraction tubes can just be used for 23 kb and smaller, but our phages are 40kb and 160 kb)  DNA isolation with Phagen DNA isolation kit with different DNAse incubation treatments worked out (recommended by Kilian):  15 min: good enough for assembly 45min-1h: used for nanopore sequencing 3h: used for nanopore sequencing
NES and FFP DNA Purification with Phenol Chloroform Precipitation and Phage DNA Isolation Kit
2018/09/24- 2018/10/03
Participants:
Brigit Tunaj
Protocol:
DNA purification , Phenol-Chloroform Precipitation , Agarose Gel electrophoresis , Gel extraction
Notes:
DNA extraction from gel trying to solve it in 1+TBE + 100mM NaCl Buffer and solving in water, and then Phenol chloroform precipitation and/or kit used
Results:
Phenol chloroform precipitation/Kit usage was not successful.
NES and FFP DNA Purification with Squeeze and Freeze Method and Phage Isolation DNA Kit
2018/09/24- 2018/10/03
Participants:
Brigit Tunaj
Protocol:
Squeeze and freeze method , DNA purification , Agarose Gel electrophoresis , Gel extraction
Notes:
DNA extraction from gel, solving in water and Phage DNA isolation kit used
Results:
Low concentration NES but most pure: 68 ng/ÂµL pro nanopore sequencing  FFP: concentration too low
