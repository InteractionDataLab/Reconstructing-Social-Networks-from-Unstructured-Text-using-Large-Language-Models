Transforming E. Coli Rosetta for pRED/ET Engineering
2018/09/05
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Electrocompetent transformation
Notes:
We used 1µg of DNA for maximum efficiency
Results:
No colonies. Something prevents E.Coli Rosetta from being transformed with pRED/ET. Ori's have been checked for compatibility and E.Coli Rosetta can be transformed with plasmids otherwise. We switched focus from this part of the project which is why we did not continue on those results.
