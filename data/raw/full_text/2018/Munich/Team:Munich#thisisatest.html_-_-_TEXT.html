Transforming E.Coli NEB Turbo to Amplify Plasmids for pRED/ET Engineering
2018/05/07
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Electro-transformation
Notes:
pkD3 contains resistance cassettes with FRT-sites for pRED engineering. Due to the temperature sensitive promotor pNPTS138-R6KT which is used for bone-knockin via RecA recombineering, the cells were incubated at 30°C overnight.
Results:
No colonies. We suspected electroporation to be a problem and switched to chemical transformation in NEB Turbo next.

Protocol:
Chemical Transformation
Notes:
Inoculate pRED at 30°C because of temperature sensitive promoter.
Results:
No colonies. We suspected the E. Coli NEB Turbo to be a problem and switched to E. Coli Dh5α.

Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Electro-transformation
Notes:
inoculate pRED at 30°C because of temperature sensitive promoter, pKD3 contains resistance cassette flanked by FRT sites.
Results:
We got cells containing the plasmid from PD Dr. Jürgen Lassak of the LMU.
Transforming E.Coli Dh5α to Amplify Plasmids for pRED/ET Engineering

Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Chemical transformation
Notes:
pKD3 contains resistance cassette flanked by FRT sites.
Results:
No colonies. Because pRED/ET could not be transformed, we got readily transformed cells from PD Dr. Jürgen Lassak from the LMU.
DNA Preparation for pRED/ET Engineering
2018/05/26
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Miniprep
Notes:
The cells from PD Dr. Jürgen Lassak were used for DNA preparation.
Results:
Concentration of the plasmids obtains from Miniprep: pRED/ET:   37,5 ng/µl pNPTS138-R6KT: 60ng/µl
