Screening Optimal Fermenter Harvesting OD600 and Difference Fermenter/ Shaking Flask
2018/08/05 - 2018/08/09
Participants:
Sophie Schönberg von Schönberg, Ariane Krus, Katie Wong, Franziska Winzig
Protocol:
Dialysis , Sonication , BCA Assay , TX-TL
Notes:
05.08.18: Preparation of 2 Liter S30A Buffer
05.08.18: Preparation of 2 Liter S30A Buffer
08.08.18: Cell extract Preparation from the different Fermenter sample pellets with sonication as lysis method
09.08.18: Determination of expression with the TX-TL test
09.08.18: Determination of protein concentration with BCA Assay
Results:
Shaking flask pellets yield better expression
Best harvesting time for Fermenter: OD 5 (Late log phase)

11.08.18 Preparation of 2 Liter S30A Buffer
11.08.18 Preparation of 2 Liter S30A Buffer
12.08.18 Preculture of Rosetta 2 in 20 ml 2YT+P Medium
13.08.18 Cultivation in shaking flasks with 660ml 2YT+P Medium
13.08.18: Washing of the cells
14.08.18: Cell extract preparation with sonication as lysis method
16.08.18: Determination of expression with the TX-TL test
16.08.18: Determination of protein concentration with BCA Assay
Results:
Centrifugal Filters: increase in protein concentration and no negative effect on TXTL expression
Run-off reaction crucial for cell extract preparation

12.09.18 Preculture of Rosetta 2 strains in 20 ml 2YT+P Medium
12.09.18 Cultivation in shaking flasks with 660ml 2YT+P Medium
Cultivating with different cultivation settings: 37°C or 37°C scaling down to 20°C after OD 0,2
12.09.18: Washing of the cells
14.09.18: Cell extract Preparation with sonication as lysis method

17.09.18: Determination of protein concentration with BCA Assay
Results:
Cultivation settings do not not change the quality of the cell extract
Pellet age does not drastically impact the quality of the cell extract
