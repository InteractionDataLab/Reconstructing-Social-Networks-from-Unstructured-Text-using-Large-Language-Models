Assembling Biobrick for RecB, C, D
2018/08/31 – 2018/09/07
Participants:
Enikö Baligács
Protocol:
PCR , Agarose gel , Gel extraction , Ligation , Chemical transformation , Mini Prep
Notes:
Three PCRs for three BioBricks with primers: RecD_BB_EcoRI_fw & RecD_BB_SpeI_rv (expected: 3,5 kb)  RecB_BB_EcoRI_fw & RecB_BB_SpeI_rv (expected: 1,8 kb)  RecC_BB_EcoRI_fw & RecC_BB_SpeI_rv (expected: 3,3 kb)  AT 68° ET 70 s; restriction digest of pSB1C3_mRFP with EcoRI and SpeI and PCR purification of the Backbone each PCR was digested with EcoRi and SpeI and ligated into the Backbone.
Results:
correct bands were cut out. Ligations gave colonies. Test PCR and sequencing confirmed ligation, sent more primers for complete insert sequencing. Completely sequenced positive clones were obtained.
Removing PstI Restriction Site from pSB1C3_RecB
2018/09/17-2018/10/02
Participants:
Enikö Baligács
Protocol:
PCR , PCR purification , Ligation , Gibson assembly , Transformation
Notes:
Because of time restraints, this experiment was done using ligation and gibson assembly approaches in parallel

PCR: RecBCD-TEV_BB_PstI_remove-GA Primer: RecB_mut_fw & RecB_mut_rv Templ: RecBCD-TEV_BioBrick Plasmid AT: 72° ET: 11 min
Results:
Colonies were obtained, but sequencing showed incorrect cut site assembly. Because of time restrictions these attempts were not continued and we focused on other parts of the project.
