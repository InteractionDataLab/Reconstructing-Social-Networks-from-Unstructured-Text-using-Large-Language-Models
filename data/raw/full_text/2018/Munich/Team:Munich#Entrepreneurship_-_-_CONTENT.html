More critical even, the number of bacteria <A href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(16)00063-3/fulltext" class="">resistant against reserve antibiotics</A> increases dramatically. According to our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Munich/Human_Practices#title_0" class="">public survey</A>, this problem is well known and recognized by the public. We explored the necessity for bacteriophage therapy by interviewing <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Munich/Human_Practices#title_4" class="">Dr. Gebhardt</A> from the University hospital “Rechts der Isar”. He already has patients who are basically untreatable because of infections caused by drug resistant bacteria. Recent authorization of bacteriophage therapy in Belgium, the Netherlands and France underscores the significance of alternative treatment options.</P><P>
Our goal is to accelerate the process from diagnosis over phage-production to application. 
We propose the complementation of the therapeutic market with bacteriophage therapy employing Phactory as a manufacturing platform.

Patents are typically filed for exceptional ideas. One important criteria for any patent is the evaluation of the state of art. As Phactory combines great scientific achievements by multiple groups with our ideas, we evaluated the possibilities to file patents for some ideas.
The entire process was accompanied by our supervisor Kilian Vogele and patent officers from the Technical University of Munich. All students involved in the project were included in the patent. Upon the approval of patent attorneys of the TUM, the patent was forwarded to external attorneys.
At this stage we are patent-pending. 
</P></DIV></DIV><H2>Interest from industry</H2><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-12"><P>
We engaged in regular exchange with to two local start-up incubators UnternehmerTUM and BioM. 
</P><P>
UnternehmerTUM is an initiative of the Technical University of Munich that simplifies the communication of start-up’s with investors. In a meeting with the UnternehmerTUM we evaluated together possible financing opportunities for our possible start-up. In a meeting with the UnternehmerTUM we evaluated together possible financing opportunities for our possible start-up. Additionally we were introduced to Phage experts from science and industry at the <A href="https://www.munich-startup.de/36123/bio-kitchen-eroeffnung/"><I>BioKitchen</I></A> opening event organized by Rüdiger Trojok from the UnternehmerTUM.
</P><P>
BioM is a local start-up cluster manager in Martinsried near Munich that openly invited us into their small buisness community to be able to engage with investors and other visionairs looking to found their own company. Additionally, they contributed to found the European iGEM Meetup we hosted. 
</P><P>
A consortium of experts in phage therapy around Jean-Paul Pirnay invited us to join them in a meeting in Belgium. In early stages of our project, we were given the chance at the <A href="https://www.munich-startup.de/36123/bio-kitchen-eroeffnung/"><I>BioKitchen</I></A> opening organized by Rüdiger Trojok to meet scientist of the Eliava Institute in Georgia (Europe) which harbors the largest library of bacteriophages worldwide. At this point, we are in active cooperation with several partners, including: The Pasteur Insitute in Paris, France and Queen Astrid Military Hospital in Belgium.
</P></DIV></DIV><H2>Time to Market</H2><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-12"><P>&quot;Why now?&quot; - is a central question we have to answer before founding a start-up company.</P><P>For this, we have to examine why bacteriophage therapy is still impeded in Western countries. One major reason is the lack of a suitable regulatory framework. In most countries, bacteriophages are classified similar to conventional drugs. Therefore, expensive medical trials are required for every individual bacteriophage. Because of their high specificity, cocktails of up to 15 different bacteriophages are required to form an effective bacteriophage-based drug, each requiring a separate clinical trial. </P><P> As bacteriophages are extracted from the environment, there is no possibility to patent them, making them unappealing for pharmaceutical companies. However, magistral preparation was recently introduced to bacteriophage therapy in Belgium. This preparation only requires bacteriophage cocktails to be produced in accordance with good manufacture practices (GMP) guidelines. This makes expensive clinical trials unnecessary. Following Belgium, already France and the Netherlands introduced the magistral preparation, too. These changes will prepare the ground for bacteriophage therapy. Therefore, now is the right time to found a start-up company and invest in this treatment option. </P></DIV></DIV><H3>Crossing the Chasm</H3><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-12 col-md-12"><P>
Newly founded companies often face difficulties adapting their market to a larger user base. This lag-phase is called the chasm. Early Investors are relatively easy to find, however convincing the general public about a product can be exceptionally difficult. We are in contact with leading scientist in Belgium and France, where bacteriophage therapy was recently allowed. Aiming to adress a large user base we also presented our idea to local hospitals. </P><P>
Although doubts about founding a start-up remain, we provide full disclosure. We carefully evaluated risks and formed alliances with experts to obviate public concerns and prepare to lead Phactory &quot;across the Chasm&quot;.</P></DIV></DIV><H3>Timeline after iGEM</H3><H2>Funding</H2><H3>Finding venture capital</H3><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-12"><P>There are major differences in the investment culture between the United States and Europe, especially in the amount of available money. Therefore, it is very difficult to find investors at the early phase of a start-up company in Europe. Especially in the field of biotechnology large amounts of money are required and the failure rate is comparably high. This is the reason why governments provides some opportunity to fund such companies that transfer scientific results into commercial products. In Germany, the available programs among others are Exist - funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs, Go-Bio - funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the ERC Proof of Concept grant. The timeframe for these grants span from 18 months to 36 months. After this funding period it is easier to find investors as the failure risk decreases. The company can then better apply for open round of financing.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row mt-3"><DIV class="col-12 mobileCol"><TABLE class="table text-light"><THEAD><TR><TH scope="col">Who</TH><TH scope="col">Time</TH><TH scope="col">Money</TH><TH scope="col">Requirements</TH></TR></THEAD><TBODY><TR><TH scope="row">ERK Proof Of Concept</TH><TD>18 months</TD><TD>180,000€</TD><TD>Support of a principal investigator</TD></TR><TR><TH scope="row">Exist (Stage I)</TH><TD>18-36 months</TD><TD>250,000€ - 600,000€</TD><TD>Scientists from Universities</TD></TR><TR><TH scope="row">Go-Bio</TH><TD>36-72 months</TD><TD>~2,000,000€ - 4,000,000€</TD><TD>Experienced scientists</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV><H3>Identifying stakeholders and competitors</H3><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-12"><P>A good network is a key resource for any start-up.
