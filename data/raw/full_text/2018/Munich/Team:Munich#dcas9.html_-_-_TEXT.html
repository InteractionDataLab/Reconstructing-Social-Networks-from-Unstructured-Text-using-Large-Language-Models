Exchange dcas9 gRNA to Target RecBD
2018/09/04 – 2018/09/30
Participants:
Enikö Baligács
Protocol:
PCR
Notes:
PCR of Cas9-handle with terminator and Promoter (ordered from IDT) with primer: gRNA_RecB_fw & gRNA_RecC_rv and Primers: gRNA_RecB_rv & gRNA_RecD_fw; PCR of Cas9_Plasmid Backbone with Primers: gRNA_RecD_rv & gRNA_RecC fw; Bands cut out from Gel and Gibson assembly was performed, Transformation in E.Coli Turbo.
Results:
First PCR failed; redone with 3 % DMSO and obtained correct band. No colonies on Plate after trying several times. We figured, that the plasmid is probably toxic to E.Coli, since it inhibits the essential RecBCD complex. One solution could have been the insertion of a more strongly regulated promoter. Since ordering new DNA would have taken too long to be able to use this plasmid in results, this attempt was not continued.
