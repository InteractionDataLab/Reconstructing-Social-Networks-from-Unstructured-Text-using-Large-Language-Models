Screening Different Amplitude, Cycles, Lysozyme and Volume Upscaling during Sonication in a Fermenter
2018/07/10 - 2018/07/20
Participants:
Sophie Schönberg von Schönberg, Ariane Krus, Katie Wong, Franziska Winzig
Protocol:
Dialysis , Sonication , Harvesting and Washing , BCA Assay , TX-TL , Cultivation (Fermentation)
Notes:
10.07.18 Preculture of Rosetta 2 in 20 ml 2YT+P Medium
11.07.18 Cultivation in Fermenter with 2l 2YT+P Medium
11.07.18: Washing of the cells
18.07.18: Cell extract preparation with sonication as lysis method
20.07.18: Determination of expression with the TX-TL test
20.07.18: Determination of protein concentration with BCA Assay
Results:
Lysozyme: increases Protein concentration
Upscaling: no negative impact
Sonication: Best at 33% Amplitude, 4ml sample volume, 16 cycles and addition of Lysozyme

Participants:
Sophie Schönberg von Schönberg, Ariane Krus, Katie Wong, Franziska Winzig
Protocol:
Buffer and Media Preperation , Sonication , Harvesting and Washing , BCA Assay , TX-TL , Cultivation (Fermentation)
Notes:
19.09.18: Preparation of 2 Liter S30A Buffer
19.09.18: Preparation of 2 Liter S30A Buffer
19.09.18: Preparation of 2 Liter 2 YTP Media
19.09.18 Preculture of Rosetta 2 in 30 ml 2YT+P Medium
20.09.18 Cultivation in fermenter with 2l 2YTP Medium
20.09.18: Washing of the cells
21.09.18: Cell extract Preparation with sonication as lysis method
25.09.18: Determination of expression with the TXTL test
25.09.18: Determination of protein concentration with BCA Assay
Results:
Upscaling during Sonication has no negative impact on Cell extract
Energy input has to be adapted to the upscaling.
