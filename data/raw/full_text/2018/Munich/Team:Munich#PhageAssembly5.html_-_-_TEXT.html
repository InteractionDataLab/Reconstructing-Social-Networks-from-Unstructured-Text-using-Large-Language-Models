T4 Phage assembly
2018/10/08- 2018/10/09
Participants:
Brigit Tunaj
Protocol:
Phage Assembly TXTL
Notes:
Phages were assembled in commercial cell extract.
Results:
Assembled phages were able to create plaques.
TEM Imaging of Phages
2018/10/08- 2018/10/17
Participants:
Brigit Tunaj
Protocol:
TEM probe preparation
Notes:
Phages were concentrated from lysate supernatants and prepared for TEM Imaging. Samples imaged: P2-Phage, P3-Phage, T5-Phage, 33-Phage, T4 Phage, T7 phages-infected bacteria and T4 phage-infected bacteria
Results:
Beautiful pictures
Purification of synthetic phages
2018/10/10- 2018/10/13
Participants:
Brigit Tunaj
Protocol:
Amicon purification of Phages , TEM probe preparation
Notes:
no notes
Results:
There were no synthetic phages visible in the TEM. Purification did not work.
DNA Methylation of T7 phage DNA for modular Phage Genome assembly
2018/10/01- 2018/10/03
Participants:
Brigit Tunaj
Protocol:
DNA methylation , DpnI Digestion , Agarose gel
Notes:
DpnI digestion was performed to test DNA methylation
Results:
Worked. Agarose Gel was empty after methylation and DpnI digestion.
