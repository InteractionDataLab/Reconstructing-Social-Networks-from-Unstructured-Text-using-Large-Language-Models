PCR Amplify Linear mtq2
2018/05/28 - 2018/05/29
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
PCR , Agarose gel , Gel Purification
Notes:
VR & VF2; TA: 66Â° ET: 50s;
Template: linear mtq2_bivtat from Lukas Aufinger (Supervisor)
Results:
Worked (PIC)
Assembling Chi6(double) and Chi6-Mtq2-Chi6 by Gibson Assembly
2018/06/04 - 2018/06/08
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
PCR , Agarose gel , Gel purification , Gibson Assembly
Notes:
Fragments were amplified, then purified and Gibson Assembly was performed.
Results:
No bands were visible on the gel after Gibson Assembly, suggesting that fragments were not amplified correctly before. Additionally, we decided to do overlap PCR instead of Gibson Assembly.
Assembling Chi6(double) and Chi6-Mtq2-Chi6 by PCR
2018/06/11 - 2018/06/14
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
PCR , Agarose gel , Gel extraction
Notes:
Fragments were amplified, then purified and overlap PCR was performed.
Results:
The Agarose gel after overlap PCR was produced incorrectly, therefore we lost the samples.
