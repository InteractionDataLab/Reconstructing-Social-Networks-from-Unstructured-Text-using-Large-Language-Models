Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Oligodimerization
Notes:
No notes.
Results:
Double-stranded oligo nucleotides were stored for the experiments.
Assembling pSB1C3_Chi6 with A3 Assembly
2018/08/01
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Restriction digest , PCR purification , Gibson assembly , Chemical Transformation
Notes:
Restriction digest with XbaI, SpeI-HF.
Results:
No colonies.
Redo: Assembling pSB1C3_Chi6 with Ligation
2018/08/02 - 2018/08/06
Participants:
Enikö Baliács
Protocol:
PCR , PCR purification , Gibson Assembly , Ligation , Chemical transformation , Miniprep , Agarose gel
Notes:
We performed linear amplification of Chi6 linear DNA stranded because assembly failed before. Gibson Assembly and ligation were performed in parallel.
Primer: BBS-PstI-rv
Results:
Colonies were obtained but following colony-PCR showed no correct bands on the gel. The colonies had to be contaminants. Eni suspected errors during the PCR reaction.
Redo: Assembling pSB1C3_Chi6 with Ligation
2018/08/07
Participants:
Enikö Baligács
Protocol:
PCR , Agarose gel
Notes:
Primer: BBS-PstI-rv
Results:
No bands on the gel. Indeed, the error before occured during the PCR reaction. Thomas (supervisor) and Eni decided to give A3 assembly one more try.
Assembling pSB1C3_Chi6 with A3 assembly
2018/08/07 - 2018/08/09
Participants:
Enikö Baligács
Protocol:
Restriction digest , PCR purification , Ligation , Chemical transformation , Miniprep , Sequncing
Notes:
We switched to the enzymes EcoRI, SpeI because we realized XbaI and SpeI had the same cutting sites and might lead to religation or false direction.
Results:
We obtained colonies, however repeated sequencing with VF2 and VR didnt give successful reads.
PCR to Assemble pSB1C3_Chi6
2018/08/16 - 2018/08/20
Participants:
Enikö Baligács
Protocol:
PCR , Restriction digest , PCR purification , Ligation , Chemical transformation
Notes:
Because oligodimerisation & ligation failed, we decided to amplify Chi6 by PCR; primers: Chi6_2clone & Chi6_fill
cycle: 98° 2 min; 98° 20 s; 57° 30s; 72° 20s (to 2 5 x) 72° 2 min; expect: ca 100 bp
Backbone: BBS_AgeI_Chi6_fw & BBP_SalI_Chi8_rv; AT: 62° expect: 2 kb
Next, we digested the samples with AgeI, SalI.
Results:
Didnt work, Eni ordered 3 different primer pairs to stitch Chi6 together by PCR.
Preparing pSB1C3 Backbone
2018/08/30
Participants:
Enikö Baligács
Protocol:
Restriction digest , Agarose gel , Gel extraction
Notes:
EcoRi & SpeI
Results:
Obtained colonies following colony-PCR showed pSB1C3_Chi6 plasmids correct.
Dimerization of Short Chi Primers to Assemble pSB1C3_Chi6
2018/08/30 - 2018/09/05
Participants:
Enikö Baligács
Protocol:
Oligodimerization , Agarose gel , Gel extraction , Ligation , Chemical Transformation , PCR , Miniprep
Notes:
The primers were stitched together and purified from Agarose gel. The samples were ligated into pSB1C3 and transformed into E.Coli NEB Turbo.  The samples were tested by test-PCR via the primers VF2 and VR.
Results:
Colonies. Consequent test-PCR proved the correctness of pSB1C3_Chi6. (PIC)
