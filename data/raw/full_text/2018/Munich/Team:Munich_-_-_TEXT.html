Phactory
Manufacturing Bacteriophages for Precision Medicine
Pathogenic Bacteria Turn Drug-Resistant at an Alarming Rate
By 2050, we project 10 million deaths per year caused by bacterial infections

Phages Are the Natural Enemies of Bacteria
Phages are capable of specifically and reliably infecting and killing bacteria but are harmless to human cells. They can therefore be administered to patients as a cure for bacterial infections. This process is called:
Phage Therapy
but...
Traditional Methods
...are unsafe for manufacturer and patient. Giant flasks of pathogenic bacteria are cultivated in order to isolate therapeutic bacteriophages.
How does Phactory work?
Diagnosis
Next generation diagnostic systems like SHERLOCK can identify pathogens with high precision and accuracy. This enables rapid identification of an individualized therapeutic strategy even in the case of multiresistant superbugs. Using Phactory, we overcome the last remaining obstacles for efficient bacteriophage therapy.
Modular Phage Assembly
With a cell-free production system we utilize one of the most revolutionary concepts of synthetic biology to produce therapeutic bacteriophages. Based on personalized diagnostics, bacteriophage DNA is chosen from a library and subjected to extensive quality assessment procedures to ensure a safe and effective application.

Synthetic Phage Manufacturing
Production of bacteriophages in a cell-free system ensures a fast and reliable application. Furthermore, working in a cell-free environment enables host independent production of phages in only 2.5% of the conventional production volume while demanding no biosafety regulations.
affordable

modular
✖
modular
Phactory is an open system. This allows for the incorporation of modified proteins while leaving the genome unmodified, thereby achieving modularity without genetic modifications.

safe
✖
safe
Host independence eliminates the need to cultivate pathogens to produce bacteriophages.

Quality Control
A thorough quality control structure assures that the produced bacteriophages are pure and effective. Risk of toxic contamination is eliminated.
pure
✖
pure
Purity is essential for any therapeutic application. We use third generation sequencing to guarantee absence of DNA contamination in the manufacturing process.

toxin-free
✖
toxin-free
Phactory assembles phages outside of living cells and is therefore free of most biological contaminants. We engineered the manufacturing system to reduce immunogenicity in humans by several orders of magnitude.

GMO-free
✖
GMO-free
The phages assembled by Phactory are purified to remove any genetically modified material before leaving a controlled lab environment.

Packaging
Bacteriophage therapy covers a broad range of potential applications. We engineered custom hardware to package bacteriophages for oral treatment. Our packaging procedure is the last step of a personalized on-site manufacturing process.
long shelf-life

Human Practices
To get an overview of how serious antimicrobial resistance really is, we visited the hospital Rechts der Isar of the Technical University of Munich to meet Dr. Friedemann Gebhardt, the head of the hygiene department. Following his suggestions, we integrated storage protocols into Phactory.

Entrepreneurship
We set a timeline including the steps that have to be taken to further advance our project. Taking the disruptive potential of Phactory into account, we evaluated the penetrable market of Phactory. Parts of our project are patent-pending.
