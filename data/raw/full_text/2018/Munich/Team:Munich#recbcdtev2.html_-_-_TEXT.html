Generation of a RecBCD-TEV Plasmid
2018/08/30- 2018/09/10
Participants:
Enikö Baligács
Protocol:
PCR , Agarose Gel , Gel extraction , Restriction digest , PCR purification , Ligation , Chemical transformation , Miniprep , Sequencing sample preparation
Notes:
PCR Template: confirmed RecBCD-WT plasmid, Primer pairs: (1) RecB_TEV_rv & RecC_TEV_fw: expected: 3,7 kb and (2) RecC_TEV_rv & RecB_TEV_fw: expected: 7,6 kb Bands were cut out from Gel and digested with SapI. After digestion PCR purification was performed and fragments were ligated and transformed in E.Coli Turbo cells
Results:
Bands appeared on the correct length. Transformation gave colonies. Three colonies were picked and sent for sequencing. After sequencing confirmed the insertion of TEV-sites, more primers were sent to sequence the full RecBCD insert. One clone was confirmed over the full sequence and that clone was used for further experiments.
