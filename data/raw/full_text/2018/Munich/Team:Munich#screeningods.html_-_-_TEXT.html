Screening Optimal Fermenter Harvesting OD600 and Difference Fermenter/ Shaking Flask
2018/08/05 - 2018/08/09
Participants:
Sophie Schönberg von Schönberg, Ariane Krus, Katie Wong, Franziska Winzig
Protocol:
Dialysis , Sonication , BCA Assay , TX-TL
Notes:
05.08.18: Preparation of 2 Liter S30A Buffer
05.08.18: Preparation of 2 Liter S30A Buffer
08.08.18: Cell extract Preparation from the different Fermenter sample pellets with sonication as lysis method
09.08.18: Determination of expression with the TX-TL test
09.08.18: Determination of protein concentration with BCA Assay
Results:
Shaking flask pellets yield better expression
Best harvesting time for Fermenter: OD 5 (Late log phase)
Screening Cell-Harvesting at Different OD600
2018/08/16 - 2018/08/20
Participants:
Sophie Schönberg von Schönberg, Ariane Krus, Katie Wong, Franziska Winzig
Protocol:
Dialysis , Sonication , Harvesting and Washing , BCA Assay , TX-TL , Cultivation (shaking flask Method) , Buffer and Media preparation
Notes:
16.08.18 Preculture of Rosetta 2 in 20 ml 2YT+P Medium
17.08.18 Cultivation in shaking flasks with 660ml 2YT+P Medium
17.08.18: Washing of the cells
17.08.18: Cell extract preparation with sonication as lysis method
20.08.18: Determination of expression with the TX-TL test
20.08.18: Determination of protein concentration with BCA Assay
Results:
Higher protein concentration seems to correlate with bad expression
Different ODs: similar results in expression and protein concentration (no correlation visible)
