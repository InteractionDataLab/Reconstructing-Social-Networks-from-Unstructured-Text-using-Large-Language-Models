06.06.18: Determination of expression with the TX-TL test
06.06.18: Determination of protein concentration with BCA Assay
Results:
Impact of PMSF: seems to have a negative impact on protein content, but results are inconsistent
Sonication: Energy input of 550J and 800J is the best combo for protein content and expression
