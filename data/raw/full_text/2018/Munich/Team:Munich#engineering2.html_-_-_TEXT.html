Transforming E. Coli Rosetta and MG1655 for pRED/ET Engineering
2018/08/28
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Electrocompetent transformation
Notes:
Genetic engineering is planned in E. Coli Rosetta, MG1655 is E.Coli WT as backup.
Results:
Colonies only on E. Coli MG1655 plate;   No colonies on E. Coli Rosetta
pRED/ET Genome Engineering of Delta msb-B and Delta recBCD Strains
2018/08/29
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
pRED/ET engineering
Notes:
The template for the resistance cassette for deletions was taken from a plasmid containing mRFP
Results:
Red colonies. Elena (Advisor) and Dominic decided to repeat the experiment but to do a dpnI digest before to get rid of the template DNA.
Transforming E. Coli DH5a to Find a Reason for the Contamination
2018/08/30
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Electrocompetent transformation
Notes:
CAP_recBCD, CAP_msbb, psb1c3_mrfp in Dh5a
Results:
Red colonies on all plates -> mRFP contamination

Verifying Deletion Strains of E. Coli MG1655
2018/09/05
Participants:
Dominic Schwarz
Protocol:
Colony PCR , Agarose gel
Notes:
Primers: VF2, geno_msb-B_rv, geno_recBCD_rv; Ta: 48Â°C t= 1kb/min
RecBCD:  1,2,3,4,5
msbB:  35,36,37,38,39 expected: RecBCD 443bp Expected: msb-B  574bp
Results:
All 5 picked colonies were positive for the insertion of the selection cassette PIC
