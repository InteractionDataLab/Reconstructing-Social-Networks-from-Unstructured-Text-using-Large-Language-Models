Restriction Digest , PCR Cleanup , Ligation , Electrocompetent transformation
Notes:
Digest with PstI and EcoRI, ligation into pSB1C3 and subsequent transformation of Dh5a
Results:
No colonies
Redo: Preserving the Gblock of EndoA in pSB1C3
2018/06/14 - 2018/07/02
Participants:
Katja Neishsalo
Protocol:
Restriction Digest , Ligation , Electrocompetent transformation , PCR , Miniprep
Notes:
The Gblock was pcr amplified before being cloned into pSB1C3.
Results:
We got colonies. DNA preparation and test pcr showed no bands on the gel. The colonies were a result of contamination.
