Phactory
Manufacturing Bacteriophages for Precision Medicine
Pathogenic Bacteria Turn Drug-Resistant at an Alarming Rate
By 2050, we project 10 million deaths per year caused by bacterial infections

Phages Are the Natural Enemies of Bacteria
Phages are capable of specifically and reliably infecting and killing bacteria but are harmless to human cells. They can therefore be administered to patients to cure bacterial infections. This process is called:
Phage Therapy

How does Phactory work?
Diagnosis
Next generation diagnostic systems like SHERLOCK can identify pathogens with high precision and accuracy. This enables rapid identification of an individualized therapeutic strategy even in the case of multiresistant superbugs. Using Phactory, we overcome the last remaining obstacles for an efficient bacteriophage therapy.
Phage Library Selection
By using a cell-free production system, we utilize one of the most revolutionary concepts of synthetic biology to produce therapeutic bacteriophages. Based on a personalized diagnosis, bacteriophage DNA is chosen from a library and is subjected to extensive quality assessment procedures to ensure a safe and effective application.

Synthetic Phage Manufacturing
Production of our bacteriophages in a cell-free system ensures a fast and dependable application. Furthermore, working in a cell-free environment enables host independent production of phages in only 2.5% of the traditional production volume while demanding no biosafety regulations.

scalable
Manufacturing in Phactory can be scaled up for mass production.

modular
✖
modular
Phactory is an open system. This allows for the incorporation of modified proteins while leaving the genome unmodified, thereby achieving modularity without GMOs.

safe
✖
safe
Host independence eliminates the need to cultivate pathogens to produce bacteriophages.

Quality Control
Extensive quality controls are employed to make sure that the produced bacteriophages are pure and effective. Potential complications due to toxins and contaminants are eliminated.
pure
✖
pure
Purity is essential for any therapeutic application. We use next-generation sequencing to ensure the absence of any contaminating DNA in the manufacturing process.
|
toxin-free
✖
toxin-free
Phactory assembles phages outside of living cells and is therefore free of most biological contaminants. We engineered it to reduce immunogenicity in humans by five orders of magnitude.
|
GMO-free
✖
GMO-free
The phages assembled by Phactory are purified to remove any genetically modified material before ever leaving a controlled lab environment.

Packaging
Bacteriophage therapy covers a broad range of potential applications. We engineered custom hardware to package bacteriophages for oral treatment. Our packaging procedure is the last step of a personalized on-site treatment process.

Human Practice
To get an overview of how serious bacterial resistance really is, we visited the university hospital Rechts der Isar of the Technical University of Munich to meet Dr. Friedemann Gebhardt, the head of the hygiene department. Following his suggestions, we integrated Storage Protocols into Phactory.

Entrepreneurship
We set a timeline, which experiments will be done by us in the future. Taking the disruptive potential of Phactory in to account, we evaluated the penetrable Market of Phactory. Parts of our project are patent-pending.
