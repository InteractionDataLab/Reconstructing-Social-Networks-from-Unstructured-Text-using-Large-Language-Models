Parts Overview
Phactory Parts
Our parts collection consists of four basic parts and one improved composite    part. All parts were generated during our project. Some parts relate to RecBCD    enzyme & its inhibition and some to the translation detection via mTurquoise.
Parts Related to RecBCD
The RecBCD enzyme, also called Exonuclease V, is both a helicase that unwinds and separates linear DNA strands, and a nuclease that degrades linear DNA 1 . It consists of three subunits: RecB, RecC and RecD. RecBCD complex is essential for cell viability as it plays an important role in repair of DNA double-strand breaks by initiating homologous recombination 2 . However, RecBCD enzyme is also a highly processive at destruction of foreign DNA, like phage DNA 3 .
RecBCD is regulated by a cis-acting DNA sequence known as Chi (Crossover Hotspot Instigator) that activates its recombination-promoting functions. Interaction with Chi causes an attenuation of the RecBCD enzyme's vigorous nuclease activity 4 . Since Chi binds RecBCD with a greater affinity than other dsDNA substrate, this can be used to inhibit RecBCD activity in TX-TL, to more efficiently express linear DNA in TX-TL.
We provide basic parts containing the full coding region of the subunit   RecC (BBa_K2722000) and   RecD (BBa_K2722001) , which can be used for an   independent study of these subunits. Moreover, you can find the   corresponding inhibitor Chi6 (BBa_K2722002) in our parts collection.
Parts Related to mTurquoise
The fluorescent reporter protein mTurquoise can be used for a variety of applications. For example, it can be used to measure translation efficiency. Our parts collection includes the coding sequence of mTurquoise (BBa_K2722003) for easy fusion to target proteins or cloning into other functional plasmids, as well as an expression construct of mTurquoise with a constitutive promoter (BBa_K2722004) .
The parts are flanked by a BioBrick prefix and suffix and contain pSB1C3 as a backbone and come from risk group 1 organisms.
