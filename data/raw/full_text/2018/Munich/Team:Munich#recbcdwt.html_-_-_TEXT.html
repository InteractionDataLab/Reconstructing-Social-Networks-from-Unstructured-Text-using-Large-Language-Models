Cloning of RecBCD-WT and RecBCD-His-Tag
2018/08/06 – 2018/08/10
Participants:
Enikö Baligács, Katja Neishsalo
Protocol:
PCR , Agarose gel , Gel purification , Gibson Assembly , Chemical transformation
Notes:
1)  PCR for Backbone with Lac-Operon and Terminator:  GA_lacO_rv & GA_lact_fw expect: 2,5 kb
2) PCR of RecC for Gibson assembly with Primers: GA_RecC_fw & GA_RecB_rv expect: 3,5 kb  ;
3) PCR of  RecBD for Gibson Assembly with Primers: GA_RecB_fw & GA_RecD_rv expect: 5,3 kb; repeated because didnt work
4) PCR of Backbone with Lac-Operon and terminator for digestion and Ligation to RecBCD-His: Primers: Lact_His_SapI_fw & RecC_lacO_His_SapI_rv expect: 2,5 kb
5) PCR of RecBD for digestion and Ligation to RecBCD-His with Primers: RecD_His_SapI_rv & RecB_His_SapI_rv expect: 5,3 kb repeated because didnt work
6) PCR of RecC for digestion and ligation to RecBCD-His with Primers: RecB-RecC-UTR_SapI_rv & RecC_His_SapI_fw
expect: 3,5 kb repeated because didnt work;
TM for all: 60 °C;
PCRs 1 – 3 were used for a Gibson Ligation, PCRs 4-5 were digested with SapI and then Ligated. Both Ligation and Gibson product were transformed. on Gel: from left to right: PCR 1-6
Results:
1,2,4 worked 3,5,6 didnt
on Gel: from left to right: PCR 1-6
Repeated PCRs 3, 5 and 6:

Testing pSB1C3_RecBCD(WT) Toxicity in Cells
2018/08/13
Participants:
Katja Neishsalo
Protocol:
Chemical transformation , Gibson Assembly , Ligation
Notes:
To improve cell survival we added 1% glucose to lb media
Results:
No colonies.
Genomic Extraction of RecBC Fragment

Participants:
Katja Neishsalo
Protocol:
Restriction digest
Notes:
Primers
Results:
Obtained more RecBD extracted from the Genome.
Redo: Assembling pSB1C3_RecBCD(WT) with Gibson Assembly
2018/08/14
Participants:
Enikö Baligács, Katja Neishsalo
Protocol:
Ligation , Chemical transformation
Notes:
BB & LacO  The fragments obtained before (PCR 4-6) were Ligated. This time T4 ligase was used instead of Quick Ligase.
Results:
Cloning work was continued at Prof. Gil Westmeyer's Lab at the Helmholtz Zentrum due to potential problems with contamination of samples and problems with competent cells.

Results:
Colonies for pSB1C3_RecBCD(WT), no colonies for pSB1C3_RecBCD-His
Sequencing pSB1C3_RecBCD(WT)
2018/08/30 – 2018/09/11
Participants:
Enikö Baligács
Protocol:
Miniprep , Sequencing , PCR
Notes:
Two different test PCRs:
Primer pair 1): Seq_RecC8_rv and  VR -> expected 7 kb
2)  Seq_RecB_fw_6 and VF2 -> expected 4 kb ; both with longAmp polymerase; AT: 58 °C; ET: 6 minutes.
Results:
Sequencing didnt give reads, but because eurofins had problems we prepared new DNA and told them to do it again. results?. Sequencial test-PCR showed a correctly assembled plasmid of recBCD(WT) (PIC)
