Phactory
Manufacturing Bacteriophages for Precision Medicine
Pathogenic Bacteria Turn Drug-Resistant at an Alarming Rate
"By 2050, we project 10 million deaths per year caused by bacterial infections"

"An alternative should be quality-assured, safe and effective"

Phages Are the Natural Enemies of Bacteria
Phages are viruses capable of specifically and reliably infecting and killing bacteria. They can therefore be administered to patients to cure bacterial infections. This process is called phage therapy.
Phage Therapy Is the True Alternative To Antibiotics, But...

How Does Phactory Work?
Diagnosis
Next generation diagnostic systems like SHERLOCK can identify pathogens with high precision and accuracy. This enables rapid identification of an individualized therapeutic strategy even in the case of multiresistant superbugs. Using Phactory, we overcome the last remaining obstacles for an efficient bacteriophage therapy.
Phage Selection
By using a cell-free production system, we utilize one of the most revolutionary concepts of synthetic biology to produce our therapeutic bacteriophages. Based on the diagnosis, phage genomes are chosen individually for each assembly and subjected to extensive quality assessment procedures to ensure a safe and effective application.
homogeneous | software-aided | high quality
Phage Manufacturing
Production of our bacteriophages in a cell-free system ensures a fast and dependable application. Furthermore, working in a cell-free environment enables host independent production of phages in only 2.5% of the traditional production volume while demanding no biosafety regulations.
cheap | scalable | modular | safe
Isolation
Our cell-free assembly approach is more than safe: it ensures complete purification of bacteriophages from the manufacturing system, thereby eliminating potential side effects.
pure | toxin-free | GMO-free
Packaging
Bacteriophage therapy covers a broad range of potential applications. We engineered custom hardware to package bacteriophages for oral treatment. Our packaging procedure is the last step of a personalized on-site treatment process.
long shelf life | portable | on-site
Therapy
Our phages are now ready for therapy. Phactory is fast and reliable enough to be a bed-site application.
