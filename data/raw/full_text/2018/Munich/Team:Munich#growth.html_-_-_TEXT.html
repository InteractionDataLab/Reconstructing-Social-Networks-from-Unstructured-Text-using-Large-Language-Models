Growth of msbB and RecBCD-Nuklease Deficient E.Coli Mutant Strains
2018/08/28
Participants:
Katja Neishsalo
Protocol:
Measuring optical density
Notes:
Strains tested: deltamsbB; DeltaRecB, DeltaRecD and WT (MG1655); inoculation of 100 ml LB medium with 1 ml preculture. Measure OD every 30 – 60 minutes.

Growth of RecB, RecD, RecBCD, msb�-B Deficient E.Coli Strains

Participants:
Katja Neishsalo
Protocol:
Measuring optical density
Notes:
Results:
The experiment shows no significant difference between growth curves of KO strains compared to those with RecBCDwt-Plasmid. The reference curves (strains transformed with mRFP) have the highest OD values. We suppose that mRFP falsified the OD values since it also emits fluorescence in the wavelength of the OD measurement.
