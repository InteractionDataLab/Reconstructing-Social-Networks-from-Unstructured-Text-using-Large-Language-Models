Initial Screening
2018/05/22 - 2018/05/23
Participants:
Sophie Schönberg von Schönberg, Ariane Krus, Katie Wong, Franziska Winzig
Protocol:
Dialysis , Bead Beating , Harvesting and Washing , BCA Assay , TX-TL , Cultivation (shaking flask Method) , Buffer and Media preparation
Notes:
22.05.18 Preparation of 2 Liter S30A Buffer
22.05.18 Preparation of 2 Liter S30B Buffer
22.05.18 Protocol: Cell Extract preparation of Buffer and Media
22.05.18: Cell extract preparation with beat beating as lysis method
23.05.18: Determination of protein concentration with BCA Assay
23.05.18: Determination of expression with the TX-TL test
Results:
High protein content, TXTL test indicates high activity
Screening for Different Amplitude and Energy Input
2018/05/23 - 2018/06/04
Participants:
Sophie Schönberg von Schönberg, Ariane Krus, Katie Wong, Franziska Winzig
Protocol:
Dialysis , Sonication , Harvesting and Washing , BCA Assay , TX-TL , Cultivation (shaking flask Method) , Buffer and Media preparation
Notes:
23.05.18: Preparation of TX-TL Buffer
25.05.18: Preparation of 2 Liter S30A Buffer
25.05.18: Preparation of 2 Liter S30A Buffer
30.05.18: Cell extract preparation with Sonication as lysis method
31.05.18: Determination of protein concentration with BCA Assay
31.05.18: Determination of expression with the TX-TL test
05.06.18: Redo: Determination of protein concentration with BCA Assay
Results:
Sonication: 33% Amplitude (4 cycles) and 10% Amplitude (5 cycles) is the best combo of Protein content and Expression,
Over 33% Amplitude has a negative impact on cell extract
