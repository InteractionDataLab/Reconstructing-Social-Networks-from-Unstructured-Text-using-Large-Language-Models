The anonymous questionnaire was of our own design, using the <A href=" https://psr.iq.harvard.edu/files/psr/files/PSRQuestionnaireTipSheet_0.pdf"> Harvard University Program on Survey Research </A> recommended by the iGEM organization.
</P><H3> Gender and age structure </H3><P>180 people were surveyed, 53.2% being off age and 46.8% under age. 58.9% of the participants were female, 41.1% were male.

These results show the great demand for an alternative of antibiotics and that the population is aware of the problems the traditional treatment can cause. Regarding those results, it is quite surprising that only 4.2% of the participants know of phagetherapy. 
 </P><P> In Phactory we try to tackle those issues by educating the public and considering their concerns regarding a new therapy method. 62.1% of the participants would hesitate to expose a sick relative to an experimental therapy like phage therapy. Some of them proposed steps that would make them feel better about trying a new therapy, mainly including Studies to prove its effectiveness, full disclosure, open communication, recommendation by a doctor. Phactory is already working on realizing those steps. We are in contact with phage therapy institutions in Belgium and with doctors from the university hospital, who are actively supporting us in realizing those goals.</P></DIV></DIV><H2>Biokitchen Opening</H2><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-12"><P>The first time we got in touch with scientists working on bacteriophage therapy was during the opening event of the <A href="https://www.munich-startup.de/36123/bio-kitchen-eroeffnung/"><I>BioKitchen</I></A> laboratory in Munich organized by Rüdiger Trojok. This modern lab offers a well-equipped place for students and start-ups with innovative ideas to perform biotechnological experiments.

During the meeting we convinced the experts that we can contribute substantially to the safety and efficacy of bacteriophage manufacturing.

To fulfill the legal requirements of a manufacturing process, we streamlined Phactory to comply with the framework of the Good Manufacturing Practice.
