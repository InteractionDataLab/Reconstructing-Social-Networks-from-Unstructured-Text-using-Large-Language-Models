Assembling p2ct_his_MBP_LBU_c2c2_gRNA-EndoA
2018/04/24 - 2018/04/26
Participants:
Katja Neishsalo
Protocol:
Restriction Digest , Gibson Ligation , Chemical Transformation
Notes:
Digest of gRNA-EndoA gBlock with NheI-HF and consequent heat inactivation 80Â°C. Samples were gibson ligated into p2ct_his_MBP_LBU_c2c2 and E.Coli NEB Turbo was transformed. Sample DNA was preped and digested to verify the correctness.
Results:
Restriction digest showed false results; Thomas (supervisor) and Katja decided to redo the experiment

Participants:
Katja Neishsalo
Protocol:
Restriction Digest , Gibson Ligation , Miniprep , Chemical Transformation
Notes:
2x chemical transformation (turbo, dh5a) 1x electroporation (dh5a)
Results:
Some colonies. Sample DNA was prepped and digested to verify the plasmid. Restriction digest gave no correct bands for the plasmid. We suspected that the Cas13a template is not good anymore.
