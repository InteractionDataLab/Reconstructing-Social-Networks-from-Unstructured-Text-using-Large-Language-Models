Not this year!
The University of Guelph iGEM Team did not participate in the 2018 InterLab Study
But we did start a club! How cool is that?! Learn about it at on our Human Practices page!
From the original page about the InterLab...
Standard Tracks: Participate in the Interlab Measurement Study and/or obtain new, high quality experimental characterization data for an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information on that part's Main Page in the Registry. The part that you are characterizing must NOT be from a 2018 part number range.
For teams participating in the InterLab study , all work must be shown on this page.
