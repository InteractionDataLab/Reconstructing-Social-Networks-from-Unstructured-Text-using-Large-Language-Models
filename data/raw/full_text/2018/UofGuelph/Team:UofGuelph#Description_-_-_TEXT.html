What's the Deal with Beerstone?
Beerstone can form on any surface that comes into contact   with beer and wort (unfermented beer) and has been a   problem for brewers as long as beer has been   produced1,2. The most problematic locations   for its formation are heat exchangers, fermentation   vessels, aging tanks, kegs, and beer dispense lines.    Beerstone is comprised of a combination of precipitated   calcium oxalate and entrapped beer   polypeptides3. Oxalate enters the brewing   process from the cereal grains and hops used to make   beer4. Oxalate is present in the form of   aqueous oxalic acid which is a corrosive, highly oxidized   compound that has strong chelating activity5.   These oxalate ions are soluble in both wort and beer,   allowing them to combine with calcium ions to form   calcium oxalate4. Calcium ions enter the   brewing process through the water, grains and water-  correction salts4. Calcium oxalate   precipitates out of solution upon formation, and is one   of the most insoluble metallo-organic compounds with a   low solubility4. In a geographic region with   high calcium levels in the drinking water, such as   Guelph, Ontario, this can lead to up to 165g of calcium   oxalate building up in a single 1000L batch of   beer1. This precipitation can happen either   during the brewing or bottling processes, or after the   beer has been bottled depending on when the calcium   oxalate formation occurs4. The point during   the process at which calcium oxalate forms is dependent   on temperature, time, pH and ion   concentration4. If calcium oxalate forms after   filtration, or if all calcium oxalate crystals are not   filtered out of the beer, haze and sediment may   form4. In addition, calcium oxalate crystals   can cause over-foaming during filling or when a   pressurized container such as a can or bottle is   opened4.
Deposits of beerstone provide protection and nutrients   for bacteria to grow due to the porous surface of the   beerstone, into which nutrient-providing proteins often   become entrapped6. This allows   for unwanted microbial growth and the formation of   biofilms upon the beerstone, for example, species of the   genera Pectinatus and Megasphaera. These   microorganisms cause beer spoilage, products with reduced   shelf-life, off-flavours and sour tastes, rendering the   beer unsuitable for sale or consumption thus resulting in   financial loss to the brewer7. Lactobacillus species in beer, in particular,   causes high turbidity which manifests as a hazy   appearance in the liquid. It also causes a high level of   diacetyl in the beer, resulting in an unwanted ‘buttery’   flavour7. With the removal of   beerstone, growth of these microbial contaminants will be   prohibited, improving brew quality and reducing   downstream processing.
Beerstone is difficult to remove for several reasons.   Calcium oxalate is extremely insoluble in both hot and   cold water, meaning that the use of harsh chemicals is   currently required for effective methods of removing   beerstone. These involve caustic or other harsh cleaners   which are dangerous to work with due to the potential for   exposure burns of the eyes and skin, and corrosive damage   to surfaces2, 3, 8. The use of   these cleaning agents require long and frequent pauses in   production which lower the efficacy of the brewing   process. Additionally, the equipment required to utilize   these caustic chemicals and the chemical disposal   requirements are costly and potentially environmentally   damaging.
Oxalobacter formigenes and the   Breakdown of Oxalate
Oxalobacter formigenes is an anaerobic, Gram-  negative bacteria native to the human gut microbiota5. O. formigenes is a safe   (biosafety hazard level 1) organism that relies solely on   oxalate as its source of energy, as well as its main   source of carbon5, 9.    Metabolism of oxalate is accomplished by two enzymes,   Formyl Coenzyme A Transferase (FRC) and Oxalyl-Coenzyme A   Decarboxylase (OXC)5, 10.  In the first reaction step, a Coenzyme A (CoA) is   transferred to oxalate by the FRC enzyme10.  It functions by forming a   ternary complex between the substrates and the enzyme,   resulting in an oxalyl-CoA complex5,   10.  The OXC enzyme then catalyzes a reductive   reaction in which formyl-CoA and CO2 are produced5, 10.  The FRC enzyme then cycles   the CoA back to a new oxalate molecule to start the   process again5, 10.  Thiamine   pyrophosphate (TPP), Mg2+, acetate, and CoA are required   for the reaction to take place5,   10.  The reaction mechanism for the breakdown of   calcium oxalate by FRC and OXC can be shown by the   equations in Figure 110:
Oxalobacter formigenes and the Breakdown of Oxalate
In nature, there are several bacteria whose metabolism involves the breakdown of oxalate, a process that could potentially be harnessed to remove beerstone buildup. Oxalobacter formigenes is an anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria native to the human gut microbiota5. O. formigenes is a safe (Biosafety Hazard Level 1) organism that relies solely on oxalate as its source of energy, as well as its main source of carbon5,9.  Metabolism of oxalate is accomplished by two enzymes, Formyl Coenzyme A Transferase (FRC) and Oxalyl-Coenzyme A Decarboxylase (OXC)5,10.
In the first reaction step, a Coenzyme A (CoA) is transferred to oxalate by the FRC enzyme10.  It functions by forming a ternary complex between the substrates and the enzyme, resulting in an oxalyl-CoA complex5,10.  The OXC enzyme then catalyzes a reductive reaction in which formyl-CoA and CO2 are produced5,10.  The FRC enzyme then cycles the CoA back to a new oxalate molecule to start the process again5,10.  Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), Mg2+, acetate, and CoA are required for the reaction to take place5,10.  The reaction mechanism for the breakdown of calcium oxalate by FRC and OXC can be shown by the equations in Figure 110:

Calcium oxalate is highly insoluble, due to the strong ionic bond between the calcium and oxalate ions.  The calcium oxalate forms a very strong lattice structure as a result of the high coulombic force between the ions11.  However, some solubility does occur, reaching an equilibrium with a low ion concentration. As oxalate is broken down into formic acid and CO2 by the enzymatic process, more calcium oxalate must dissolve into solution in order to maintain equilibrium, as per Le Châtelier’s principle.
Creating a Biological System to Aid in the Breakdown of Oxalate
Overall given dangers, time and costs to the brewing industry involved in the removal of beerstone, we propose to investigate the use of FRC and OXC for the safe and efficient breakdown of beerstone from brewing equipment. Aside from the production and characterization of FRC and OXC to be used as subsequent treatment on calcium oxalate (and related compounds such as sodium oxalate), we hope to develop a biological system as a form of beerstone treatment. In a cell system, oxalate is brought in by an oxalate-formate antiporter (OxIT) and converted to CO2 and formyl-CoA. Formyl-CoA is reused by FRC as a CoA donor in a subsequent reaction and released from the cell as formate by OxIT5 (Figure 2).
Utilizing S. cerevisiae, we can transform the episomal plasmid pD1218 into w303α that replaces the MATα pheromone secretion system with our genes of interest (frc, oxc) The OxIT antiporter will also be cloned into our plasmid system to allow for the presence of an alternative energy generation system with both FRC and OXC working to facilitate the breakdown of oxalate. The metabolic activity of w303α will be characterized with a modified Minimum Inhibitory Concentration Assay in which yeast will be grown in varying concentrations of C2CaO4 . After 48 hours, the levels of oxalate in solution will be measured using a Calcium Oxalate Dissolution Kit (Trinity Biotech).
