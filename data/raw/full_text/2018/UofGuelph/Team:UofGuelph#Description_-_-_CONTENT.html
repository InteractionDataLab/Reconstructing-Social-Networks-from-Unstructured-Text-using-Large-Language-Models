Beerstone can form on any surface that comes into contact 

with beer and wort (unfermented beer) and has been a 

problem for brewers as long as beer has been 

produced<SUP>1,2</SUP>. The most problematic locations 

for its formation are heat exchangers, fermentation 

vessels, aging tanks, kegs, and beer dispense lines.  

Beerstone is comprised of a combination of precipitated 

calcium oxalate and entrapped beer 

polypeptides<SUP>3</SUP>. Oxalate enters the brewing 

process from the cereal grains and hops used to make 

beer<SUP>4</SUP>. Oxalate is present in the form of 

aqueous oxalic acid which is a corrosive, highly oxidized 

compound that has strong chelating activity<SUP>5</SUP>. 

These oxalate ions are soluble in both wort and beer, 

allowing them to combine with calcium ions to form 

calcium oxalate<SUP>4</SUP>. Calcium ions enter the 

brewing process through the water, grains and water-

correction salts<SUP>4</SUP>. Calcium oxalate 

precipitates out of solution upon formation, and is one 

of the most insoluble metallo-organic compounds with a 

low solubility<SUP>4</SUP>. In a geographic region with 

high calcium levels in the drinking water, such as 

Guelph, Ontario, this can lead to up to 165g of calcium 

oxalate building up in a single 1000L batch of 

beer<SUP>1</SUP>. This precipitation can happen either 

during the brewing or bottling processes, or after the 

beer has been bottled depending on when the calcium 

oxalate formation occurs<SUP>4</SUP>. The point during 

the process at which calcium oxalate forms is dependent 

on temperature, time, pH and ion 

concentration<SUP>4</SUP>. If calcium oxalate forms after 

filtration, or if all calcium oxalate crystals are not 

filtered out of the beer, haze and sediment may 

form<SUP>4</SUP>. In addition, calcium oxalate crystals 

can cause over-foaming during filling or when a 

pressurized container such as a can or bottle is 

opened<SUP>4</SUP>.
Deposits of beerstone provide protection and nutrients 

for bacteria to grow due to the porous surface of the 

beerstone, into which nutrient-providing proteins often 

become entrapped<SUP>6</SUP>. This allows 

for unwanted microbial growth and the formation of 

biofilms upon the beerstone, for example, species of the 

genera <I>Pectinatus</I> and <I>Megasphaera</I>. These 

microorganisms cause beer spoilage, products with reduced 

shelf-life, off-flavours and sour tastes, rendering the 

beer unsuitable for sale or consumption thus resulting in 

financial loss to the brewer<SUP>7</SUP>. 

<I>Lactobacillus</I> species in beer, in particular, 

causes high turbidity which manifests as a hazy 

appearance in the liquid. It also causes a high level of 

diacetyl in the beer, resulting in an unwanted ‘buttery’ 

flavour<SUP>7</SUP>. With the removal of 

beerstone, growth of these microbial contaminants will be 

prohibited, improving brew quality and reducing 

downstream processing. 
Beerstone is difficult to remove for several reasons. 

Calcium oxalate is extremely insoluble in both hot and 

cold water, meaning that the use of harsh chemicals is 

currently required for effective methods of removing 

beerstone. These involve caustic or other harsh cleaners 

which are dangerous to work with due to the potential for 

exposure burns of the eyes and skin, and corrosive damage 

to surfaces<SUP>2, 3, 8</SUP>. The use of 

these cleaning agents require long and frequent pauses in 

production which lower the efficacy of the brewing 

process. Additionally, the equipment required to utilize 

these caustic chemicals and the chemical disposal 

requirements are costly and potentially environmentally 

damaging.

Metabolism of oxalate is accomplished by two enzymes, 

Formyl Coenzyme A Transferase (FRC) and Oxalyl-Coenzyme A 

Decarboxylase (OXC)<SUP>5, 10</SUP>. 
In the first reaction step, a Coenzyme A (CoA) is 

transferred to oxalate by the FRC enzyme<SPAN class="super">10</SPAN>.  It functions by forming a 

ternary complex between the substrates and the enzyme, 

resulting in an oxalyl-CoA complex<SUP>5, 

10</SUP>.  The OXC enzyme then catalyzes a reductive 

reaction in which formyl-CoA and CO2 are produced<SUP>5, 10</SUP>.  The FRC enzyme then cycles 

the CoA back to a new oxalate molecule to start the 

process again<SUP>5, 10</SUP>.  Thiamine 

pyrophosphate (TPP), Mg<SUP>2+</SUP>, acetate, and CoA are required 

for the reaction to take place<SUP>5, 

10</SUP>.  The reaction mechanism for the breakdown of 

calcium oxalate by FRC and OXC can be shown by the 

equations in Figure 1<SUP>10</SUP>:

Calcium oxalate is highly insoluble, due to the strong ionic bond between the calcium and oxalate ions.  The calcium oxalate forms a very strong lattice structure as a result of the high coulombic force between the ions<SUP>11</SUP>.  However, some solubility does occur, reaching an equilibrium with a low ion concentration. As oxalate is broken down into formic acid and CO<SUB>2</SUB> by the enzymatic process, more calcium oxalate must dissolve into solution in order to maintain equilibrium, as per Le Châtelier’s principle.</P><H1 class="descSub">Creating a Biological System to Aid in the Breakdown of Oxalate</H1><P class="descRef"> 
Overall given dangers, time and costs to the brewing industry involved in the removal of beerstone, we propose to investigate the use of FRC and OXC for the safe and efficient breakdown of beerstone from brewing equipment. Aside from the production and characterization of FRC and OXC to be used as subsequent treatment on calcium oxalate (and related compounds such as sodium oxalate), we hope to develop a biological system as a form of beerstone treatment. In a cell system, oxalate is brought in by an oxalate-formate antiporter (OxIT) and converted to CO<SUB>2</SUB> and formyl-CoA. Formyl-CoA is reused by FRC as a CoA donor in a subsequent reaction and released from the cell as formate by OxIT5 (Figure 2). 
Utilizing <I>S. cerevisiae</I>, we can transform the episomal plasmid pD1218 into w303α that replaces the MATα pheromone secretion system with our genes of interest (frc, oxc) The OxIT antiporter will also be cloned into our plasmid system to allow for the presence of an alternative energy generation system with both FRC and OXC working to facilitate the breakdown of oxalate. The metabolic activity of w303α will be characterized with a modified Minimum Inhibitory Concentration Assay in which yeast will be grown in varying concentrations of C<SUB>2</SUB>CaO<SUB>4</SUB> . After 48 hours, the levels of oxalate in solution will be measured using a Calcium Oxalate Dissolution Kit (Trinity Biotech).
