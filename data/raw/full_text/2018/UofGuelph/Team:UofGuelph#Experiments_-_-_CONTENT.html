Our experimental goal this year was to clone <I>frc</I> and <I>oxc</I> into <I>E. coli</I> DH5α using pET-28a. To accomplish this goal we had <I>frc</I> and <I>oxc</I> synthesized by IDT and used PCR to add the correct restriction enzyme sites. Site directed mutagenesis was used to add the PstI cut site to pET-28a, then <I>frc</I> and <I>oxc</I> were inserted using standard restriction enzyme digests and ligation. pET-28a<I>frc</I> and pET-28a<I>oxc</I> were then transformed into DH5α.</P><H1 class="exEntery">Preparation of Competent Cells</H1><P class="descP"> This year we prepared two different types of competent cells, DH5α and BL21. We used a chemical competency method involving calcium chloride. As the final step in preparation all cells were frozen in either 50 µl or 100 µl volumes by submersion in liquid nitrogen. Competent cells were then stored in a -80°C freezer for further use.</P><H1 class="exEntery">pET-28a isolation</H1><P class="descP"> pET-28a was purified from DH5α/pET-28a cells provided by Cezar Khursigara's Lab using a miniprep kit (Thermofisher Scientific). Purified DNA concentration was checked using a nanodrop and samples were frozen in a -20°C freezer for further use.</P><H1 class="exEntery">Site Directed Mutagenesis of pET-28a</H1><P class="descP">PCR was used to conduct site directed mutagenesis to add a PstI cut site to pET-28a. Two basepairs were changed at the wild type XhoI cut site to change the sequence from ctcgag to ctgcag. Primers were ordered from IDT.</P><H1 class="exEntery">Confirmation of SDM Success</H1><P class="descP">A double restriction enzyme digest was conducted to ensure that the PstI cut site had been added correctly. A single restriction enzyme digest and undigested plasmid were used as controls. All digestion products were run on an agarose gel and visualized using either Novel Juice (FroggaBio) or SyBr. Samples were frozen in a -20°C freezer for further use.

PCR primers and synthesized <I>frc</I> and <I>oxc</I> were all obtained from IDT.</P><H1 class="exEntery">Adding <I>frc</I> and <I>oxc</I> to pET-28a</H1><P class="descP"> The genes <I>frc</I> and <I>oxc</I> were added individually to pET-28a using standard ligation techniques.
</P><H1 class="exEntery">Transformation of pET-28a<I>frc</I> and pET-28a<I>oxc</I> into DH5α</H1><P class="descP"> Using standard heat shock techniques pET-28a<I>frc</I> and pET-28a<I>oxc</I> were transformed into DH5α.
 Transformed cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C with rotation (using our homemade rotator) then plated on Kanamycin plates.</P><H1 class="exEntery">Confirmation of the Presence of <I>frc</I> and <I>oxc</I></H1><P class="descRef"> Colony PCR was used to confirm the presence of <I>frc</I> and <I>oxc</I> from the colonies grown from the transformation. One of each type of colony was selected to make liquid culture, and then glycerol stocks from for long term storage of the transformed bacteria.</P><FOOTER class="footerbackground"><P class="footertext" style="text-align:center!important;">University of Guelph iGEM 2018</P></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
