BL21 (DE3) pLysS strains from Georgina Cox were inoculated into 5 ml of LB-Cham (5 ml of LB, 5uL of Chloramphenicol).
DH5a strains from Georgina Cox were inoculated into 5 ml of LB.
They were placed in the warm room on third floor, shaking (275 rpm) at 37°C to be grown overnight.
Day 2
5 mL seed culture of cells were grown in LB medium to saturation.
Culture was diluted back into 25–50 mL fresh LB in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask.  
Seed culture was diluted by at least 1/100. Diluted culture was grown to an OD600 = 0.4 - 0.5
Eppendorf tubes were put on ice so they were cold when the cells were aliquotted into them later.
TSS was chilled.
The culture was split into two 50 mL falcon tubes and incubated on ice for 10 min.
All subsequent steps were carried out at 4°C and the cells were kept on ice wherever possible
Cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm and 4°C.
Supernatant was removed and any remaining media was pipetted out.
Cells were resuspended in 2.5 mL of chilled TSS buffer (5% of initial volume).
Cells were chilled on ice for 15 minutes.
50-200 μL aliquots were added to the chilled eppendorfs and and flash frozen with liquid nitrogen.
Cells were stored at -80°C.

Frc-EcoRI-pst1 @ 11.5ng/uL
These plasmids were from last year's iGEM freezer box and each of them were transformed into DH5a competent cells using the following protocol.
The competent cells were taken out of the freezer and were sat on ice for 10 minutes.
The cells were lightly vortexed on the lowest setting for 10 seconds.
15 uL of the transformed plasmid DNA was added directly to the microtube containing the competent cells and pipetted to mix.
The microtube was incubated on ice for 30 minutes.
The microtube was heat shocked at 42°C for exactly 30 seconds.
The cells were then put back on ice for another 5 minutes.
950uL of SOC media (from the Shapiro lab) was added into each tube.
The tubes were placed in an epitome holder and then grown in a 250 rpm shaker for 1 hr.
While the tubes were on the shaker for 1 hr, the LB - Kan (50 ug/mL) plates were taken out and warmed up in a 37°C static incubator for 1 hr.
The cells were taken out of the shaker and then transferred to the LB-Kan plate using a pipette and sterile glass beads. The plates were incubated overnight at 37°C

5 μL of Kan was added to 5 mL of LB, then vortexed.
50 μL of pET-28a-PstI strains were inoculated into the LB-Kan solution.

PstI culture was dispensed into 1 mL aliquots in 1.5 mL epitubes (total of 4 tubes). The tubes were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. 
Supernatant was discarded. Another 1 mL of PstI culture was added to the tubes. They were centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded.
250 μL of resuspension solution (from GeneJET miniprep kit) was added. The bacteria were completely resuspended by pipetting up and down until solution was clear.
250 μL of lysis solution from kit was added. The mixture was mixed thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times, then incubated for 5 min at room temperature.
350 μL of neutralization solution from kit was added, then mixed by inversion and incubated for 5 min at room temperature.
Tube centrifuged for 5 min at 12000 rpm to pellet cell debris and chromosomal DNA.
Supernatant was transferred to GeneJET spin column (in collection tube) by pipetting, avoiding disturbing or transferring the precipitate.
Spin column was centrifuged for 1 min at 12000 rpm. Flow-through was discarded and the column was placed back in the same collection tube.
500 μL of wash solution (pre-diluted with ethanol) from kit was added to spin column. Column was centrifuged for 1 min at 12000 rpm and flow-through was discarded again.
The previous step was repeated using another 500 μL of wash solution.
Flow-through was discarded and column was centrifuged for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash solution.

The gel of the digestion was run with no visible bands seen and so the the digestion will have to be repeated. 
The gel of the PCR had no bands and the annealing temperature may have been the reason for this.

Minipreps of DH5a-pET28a-PstI were prepared as described under the heading &quot;Miniprep of Pet-28a-PstI&quot; on May 28th using the PstI-LB-Kan cultures prepared the previous night, with the exception that in step (1), the entirety of the culture was only dispensed into two epitubes instead of four. The tubes were centrifuged, discarding the supernatant, a total of five times so that the number of cells placed in each epitube was equivalent to the number of cells present in 5 mL of LB-Kan culture. Once completed, the optical density of the minipreps was measured using the Nanodrop, with the elution buffer used in the miniprep procedure as the blank. The results were as follows:

50 μL minipreps of pET28a-PstI were created in two epitubes, using the protocol outlined above. Two culture tubes from the previous day containing 5 mL DH5a-pET28a-PstI-LB-Kan were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for five minutes in the centrifuge next to the fridge in order to pellet out the cells (a slower speed than usual was used because the centrifuge is old and its safety was uncertain). During the process, 300 μL of Lysis buffer was added to each tube by accident instead of 250 μL, so 400 μL of neutralization solution was added instead of 350 μL in order to compensate for this. After the miniprep was complete, the optical density of the minipreps was measured using the Nanodrop. The density, A260, and A260/A280 of each miniprep was labeled on the side of each epitube. 20 μL of the miniprep with a density of 30.2 ng/μL was pipetted into a separate epitube to be digested, while the miniprep tubes were also labelled on the lid and then placed in the freezer.
A restriction enzyme double digest using PstI and EcoRV was conducted on 20 μL of pET28a-PstI using the procedure outlined above. The digest was then labelled and placed overnight in the incubator next door.
