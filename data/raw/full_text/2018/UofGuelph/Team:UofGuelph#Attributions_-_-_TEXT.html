Financial Support
A special thanks to our University! The University of Guelph has supported us in numerous ways. We would like to thank the Dean of the College of Biological Sciences, Johnathan Newman, The Vice-President of Research, Malcolm Campbell and the Chair of the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Marc Coppolino for their financial support.
Lab Supplies and Resources
We would like to thank Marc Coppolino and Guelph's Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology for use of lab space over the course of the competition. As well as to our Supervisors Drs Rebecca Shapiro, Stephen Seah and Cezar Khursigara. Over the course of the competition, they have donated laboratory supplies and resources to the our team. As well thank you to IDT for their donation of DNA synthesis and New England Biolabs for their donation of reagents. Without your help this project would have never had a hope of succeeding. A special thanks to the University of Guelph Lab Services department for their generous support with oligo synthesis and sequencing, and Sandra Walters in particular for her dedication in supporting our team.
Additional Resources
One of the beauties of iGEM is that it brings together wonderful people from all walks of life. It shows that help and support can come in many forms, and every bit counts. A big thank you to the Guelph Queer Equality club for graciously allowing us to use their button maker! A huge thank you to everyone who kindly took the time to express their support, or even just send a smile our direction! Thank you to Key Centre Engravables for their donation of team shirts
Mentorship
A huge thank you to the previous year’s Guelph iGEM Team for helping us expand and get off the ground. We would like to especially thank our newest mentors Dr. Rebecca Shapiro and Dr. Stephen Seah for their openness and guidance in our project this year. Without their guidance we would not have achieved what we have in our project and not garnered the support and attention that our team has built up within our local community this year.
Thank you to everyone who has supported us throughout our journey so far!
We look forward to many years of
awesome science and experiences in the future.
