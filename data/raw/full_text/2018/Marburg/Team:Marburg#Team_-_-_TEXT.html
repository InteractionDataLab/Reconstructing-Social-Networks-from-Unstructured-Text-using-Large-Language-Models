Meet the Team
We as iGEM Team Marburg 2018 are very proud to present this years team. The team consists of 15 team members from various different fields ranging from traditional biology, Molecular and Cellular Biology, chemistry, physics to computer science and this made it possible to work in a very interdisciplinary environment. It was only possible to do this project thanks to our two team leaders, our instructor, and our two PIs. Last but not least we want to thank our amazing board of 8 advisors because of their continuous support the project became what it is today.

Favorite Bacterium Vibrio natriegens - are there other bacteria out there?
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens The moment when I wanted to prepare competent cells and took them out of the shaker with OD 0.4. Shaking by hand for five minutes and I had them ready for harvesting with OD 0.5.
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens It´s much harder to postpone lab work if your instructor sees the grown colonies early in the evening
Memduha Muratoglu
Field of Study: Master's student Molecular and Cellular Biology
Subgroup: Strain Engineering
Favorite Bacterium: Myxococcus xanthus - because it forms sun shaped spots on agar plates.
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: When I forgot to incubate plates at 37°C and could nevertheless perform colony PCR after 3 hours.
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: When I had to shorten my coffee breaks because the culture would otherwise become to dense

Daniel Bauersachs
Field of Study: Master's student Molecular and Cellular Biolog
Subgroup: Strain Engineering
Favorite Bacterium: Treponema pallidum
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: After we created the first growth curve and showed how f***ing incredible fast it grows.
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: I don't understand the question...

Benjamin Daniel

Subgroup: Metabolic Engineering
Favorite Bacterium: Streptomyces venezuelae - because i like the hyphal growth and chloramphenicol!
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: When i could leave early because I could quickly pick colonies from a plate I had made after lunch.
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: When we still worked with E. coli, mistakenly plating V. natriegens on LB instead of LBv2 plates.

Torben Gutermuth
Field of Study: Master's student in Chemistry
Subgroup: Modeling
Favorite Bacterium: Deinococcus radiodurans - because it can survive a nuclear explosion
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: When Daniel M. told me I get to be on the paper
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: When I realized that he is joking

Carlos Helbig
Field of Study: Master's student in Molecular and Cellular Biology
Subgroup: Part Collection
Favorite Bacterium: Lactobacillus sp. - because it is used for yoghurt, cheese, beer and other deserts
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: I transformed it in the morning and picked the colonies in the afternoon
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: I had to inoculate a liquid culture four times to get cells in their exponential phase because they grew just too fast!
Tobias Hensel
Field of Study: Master's student in Chemistry
Subgroup: Part Collection
Favorite Bacterium: Photorhabdus luminescens - safed a lot of lives and it glows
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: The incredibly fast growth rate of Vibrio natriegens allowed us to trace forgotten Lev 0 parts within a day starting with the PCR. Which made it possible for us to provide such a large variety of parts in this short time
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: Due to the rapid growth, there are no more breaks of 10 hours in which you could scarf. You always have something to do. *schnüff*
Josef Hoff

Favorite Bacterium: Vibrio harveyi - they can make big regions of sea get glowing if they work together. They are a model organism for Quorum sensing what shows again that Bacteria are not as simple as common people think.
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: The time before Wiki freeze because when you need a new part and a cloning result best at the end of the day, you can actually get it.
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: Definitely building a LVL2 Part in 3 days!   And when your CRISPR colonies are taking much longer than you are used to for colonies appearing.
Jana Jung
Field of Study: Master's student Molecular and Cellular Biology
Subgroup: Strain Engineering
Favorite Bacterium: Myxococcus xanthus - because it has a "wolf pack" predatory behavior
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: The moment you realize that you have forgotten to start an overnight culture and still be able to do a plasmid preparation that day.
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: The moment when your culture is overgrown for the hundredth time.

Benjamin Marchal
Field of Study: Bachelor's student in Computer Sciences
Subgroup: Wiki
Favorite Bacterium: Bacteria are boring. How about a virus that is mining Bitcoins
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: I never had to work with it
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: I never had to work with it
Daniel Marchal
Field of Study: Master's student Molecular and Cellular Biology
Subgroup: Metabolic Engineering
Favorite Bacterium: Synechococcus elongatus - because it is autotroph and has a fancy color
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: When I saw that it has a higher protein yield and much better enzyme activities than E. coli
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: When I had to pronounce it correctly for the first time. Why isn’t it called Vibrio baam?
Franziska Müller
Field of Study: Master's student Molecular and Cellular Biology
Subgroup: Strain Engineering
Favorite Bacterium: Myxococcus xanthus - because of its social behavior (plus you’ll never forget the first bacterium you worked with)
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: Transformation in the morning, clones in the evening *after lunch (very helpful when Wikifreeze is approaching)
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: “The culture’s too dense...again.”

Favorite Bacterium: V. natriegens - it’s cool and the one I know best
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: not having to work in a lab.

Favorite Bacterium: Cyanobacterium - For its versatility in, and impact on nature and science. its important connection to biological evolution and its amazing potential for semi-artificial photosynthesis and other biotechnological applications.
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: The immediate success I achieved with the cotransformation and other electroporation of our constructs. It was my first ever transformation. And it worked perfectly in Vibrio natriegens.
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: When realising somewhat late that “just add more salt” might cause more problems when initially thought / not starting on the development of a chloride-reduced medium sooner ^^’

Favorite Bacterium: Vibrio natriegens - the future!
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: Being able to share this incredibly fast organism with the other iGEM teams through the Vibrigens collaborations.
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: (Some of) the other iGEM teams finding it too fast.

Favorite Bacterium: Pseudomonas syringae - because it can make it snow!
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: When going home early because I could pick after just few hours.
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: When I smelled old plates with V. natriegens on it.

Favorite Bacterium: Vibrio harveyi -because it glows in the dark
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: When i saw how dense it could grow!
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: When my mini prep did not work because my culture grew to dens.

Favorite Bacterium: saccharomyces cerevisiae - (Yeast bacterium :D), because it´s cooler than all bacteria together
The moment I loved working with V. natriegens: when i realized that aqua cloning works so much better in vibrio than in E.coli
The moment I hated working with V. natriegens: when realized, how fast you have to be if you want to measure a growth curve by hand, without messing it up
