About Our Team
We are 12 high school students gathered from various different schools to participate in iGEM 2018.
Organized with students from Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies(HAFS), CheongShim International Academy(CSIA), Korean Minjok Leadership Academy(KMLA), Korean International School(KIS), Shanghai American School(SAS), we are a team with much diversity! We hope to bring synergy between students from different backgrounds to complete this year's project.
This project is the result of hard work and collaboration of every single team member. We learned to collaborate effectively with students from different schools and to appreciate all team members who were responsible and tried their best.
Our team members are enthusiastic to make the most out of iGEM experience. Gathered by friends' friends, we became close in the summer, working in the lab and doing human practices together. Although we may be physically apart, we have tried our best to efficiently distribute work and enjoy each other's company. We are thankful for iGEM in providing such opportunity and hope to see all of you at the Giant Jamboree!

Hello!! I am the team captain of BioMarvel iGEM team this year. My participation in last year’s iGEM drove me to re-enter iGEM 2018. As a team captain, I am in charge of the contact within all of our team members as well as coordinating the whole project. I was involved in the project from start to end, from topic selection, experiments, human practices, to uploading everything on the wiki homepage. Although it has been a long, arduous journey, it had been a fulfilling one and there were many take-aways. I am interested in biotechnology and in the future, I hope to contribute to the development of early diagnosis of diseases and to eventually move toward preventing them.

I’ve been interested in diagnostic biotechnology since childhood. iGEM was a great opportunity for me to fulfill this vision. I hope to reach beyond the limits of classroom science and not only learn and develop new ideas, but also help spread our project to the public. In the team I was the main wiki and web developer, a role where I orchestrated the planning, creation, design and development of wiki and computer related parts of the project. I also participated in writing articles, experimentation and  human practices. I’m deeply curious about the universe and have interests in a variety of fields, including computers, biotechnology, and writing. I plan to further study these areas and contribute what I can.

The reason why I participated in IGEM is to broaden my field of observation and to build biological and chemical knowledge through team projects. I hope that I can take a step closer to my desired field-chemical engineering-by making a heart diagnosis kit through IGEM. To fulfill this dream, I actively participated in experiments and human practices with my teammates. Team projects already extremely supported me, but I want to develop myself especially by listening to and embracing the opinions of other participants at the convention hall.

I have always been deeply intrigued by biochemistry and biomedical studies and thus plan to pursue a doctoral degree in molecular biology. By participating in iGEM, I have learned much about synthetic biology and the bright future that bioengineering holds. In our team’s project, I participated in lab experiments, human practices, and collaboration. In the future, I hope to incorporate more engineering concepts into biological fields to explore innovative ways to prevent and treat diseases.

Hi! It is a great pleasure to join in the Jamboree to present our work. I was mainly responsible for coordinating the wiki team project through planning the website design and developing the visualization of the domain via coding with my friends. I was also in charged of creating the entrepreneurship and involved in lab work, human practices, and collaboration. Participating in the iGEM competition encouraged me to have a stronger passion in bioengineering and web-development. Moreover, optimizing the given opportunity to map out the process of commercialization enabled me to strengthen my ability in terms of entrepreneurship: from finding the limits to solving and organizing the business project based on the product our team have researched. It is a golden opportunity to make new friends who are having a similar field of interest as I have. Enjoy traveling our website!

As the member of the team I took a role in making a website  introducing team’s research and  experiment. I have been interested in bioengineering and biomimetic for the past few years and is excited to be gaining much experience with our team. I was able to learn detailed information about biology. I was also able to learn how to work together as a team and the importance of cooperation and coordination between team members. I plan to pursue a Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Computation in the future. Furthermore I wish to take a deeper approach in studying biology especially related to chips and engineering.

Hello! In this iGEM project, I was associated with the Collaboration Team and worked with other teams competing in the iGEM competition to transform and translate the video of iGEM into Korean and upload it to social media. I also assisted with experiments during my summer vacation. Through this wonderful opportunity, I was able to learn many things, in regards to biology, and learned how to have a positive impact on people's lives in the future.

I am interested in general science and want to experience the various field of science. In team BioMarvel, I am mainly engaged in the design and edit the wiki, and also perform a human practice in middle school. Not only those projects but also participate in collaboration and assist the experiment, which requires an enthusiastic mind.  As I am an outgoing one, I can contribute to the activities with pleasure. Through IGEM, I hope to communicate with diverse people who are interested in the variety of field.

I was rarely granted an opportunity to conduct a research on innovative disciplines such as synthetic biology. Therefore, my innate propensity for scientific challenge and discovery led me to participate in iGEM. I am mainly responsible for lab work and collaboration. I worked with other lab members on the interlab procedure and our project of developing a biosensor chip. I was also in charge of contacting other iGEM teams and organizing meet-ups. I actively participated in all events organized by our human practices team to advertise our project. I hope to see myself grow as a more collaborative member and a more innovative researcher as I participate in iGEM.

Hi! Biomedical research has been a fascination for me for a long time, but school science classes covered this material very briefly and I wanted to learn more. Also, I aim to eventually have a career in biology or engineering or both. Being on an iGEM team has been a great opportunity for me to get lab experiences and, especially, wiki designing, which was my role in the team. It was a pleasure to participate in iGEM, which provided me a worldwide platform that widened my perspective on synthetic biology and its power to make huge changes in the world.

Hi! I’m a second-year student planning to major in biology and psychology. My passion for science, especially synthetic biology, led me to join the iGEM competition. Being responsible for managing Human Practices and working in the lab, I had a great opportunity to bring new ideas and share our project with other people in various fields. Actually, I’m a very optimistic person who always tries to find positive in any situation and listen carefully to others. Aside from my many other interests, I love to write poems, be in nature, study Chinese, play flag football and challenge myself to anything new.

When I was in third grade in middle school, I learned from a research that many children were subject to the severe human rights violation. Since then, my dream has been becoming a doctor who works for human rights. In an effort to help the underprivileged, I have joined the IGEM team to create a system that makes the medical checkups easier. The BIOMARVEL team I am in charge of several activities called Human Practice. We have conducted campaigns promoting the prevention of heart disease in several places. Through the IGEM activities, I have learned that a small concern or a question can be the driving force behind the world's transformation.
