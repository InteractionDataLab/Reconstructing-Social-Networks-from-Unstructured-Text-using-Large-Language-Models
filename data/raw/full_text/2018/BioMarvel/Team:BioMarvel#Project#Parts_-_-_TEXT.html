ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Promoter (J23100, Anderson Strong)
Constitutive promoter family
Parts J23100 through J23119 are a family of constitutive promoter parts isolated from a small combinatorial library. J23119 is the "consensus" promoter sequence and the strongest member of the family. These promoter parts can be used to tune the expression level of constitutively expressed parts.
RBS (B0034, Ribosome Binding Site)
RBS based on Elowitz repressilator.
Designed by: Vinay S Mahajan, Voichita D. Marinescu, Brian Chow, Alexander D Wissner-Gross and Peter Carr IAP, 2003.
Terminator (B0010)
Transcriptional terminator consisting of a 64 bp stem-loop.
Designed by: Randy Rettberg
Terminator (B0012)
Transcription terminator for the E. coli RNA polymerase.
Designed by: Reshma Shetty
GBP (K2885001, Gold-Binding Polypeptide)
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2885001
This part encodes gold binding polypeptide (GBP). It is consisted of triplication of 14 amino acids (MHGKTQATSGTIOS).
ProG (K2885000, Protein G)
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2885000
This part encodes protein G (ProG). The DNA sequences encoding ProG were derived from the genomic DNA of Staphylococcus aureus G418.
GBP-ProG (K2885002, Gold Binding Protein, Protein G Fusion Protein)
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2885002
This part encodes GBP-ProG fusion protein. The parts were constructed from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT).
