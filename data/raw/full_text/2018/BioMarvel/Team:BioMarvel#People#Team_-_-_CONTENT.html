I am the team captain of BioMarvel iGEM team this year. My participation in last year’s iGEM drove me to re-enter iGEM 2018. As a team captain, I am in charge of the contact within all of our team members as well as coordinating the whole project. I was involved in the project from start to end, from topic selection, experiments, human practices, to uploading everything on the wiki homepage. Although it has been a long, arduous journey, it had been a fulfilling one and there were many take-aways. I am interested in biotechnology and in the future, I hope to contribute to the development of early diagnosis of diseases and to eventually move toward preventing them.</P></SECTION><A href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="document.getElementById('light1').style.display='none';document.getElementById('fade').style.display='none'"><H3 style="text-align: center; color: #203864;">Close</H3></A></DIV><A class="mIntro" href="#light2" onclick="document.getElementById('light2').style.display='block';document.getElementById('fade').style.display='block'"><H4 style="text-align: center;">DaHyeon Choi</H4></A><DIV id="light2" class="white_content"><SECTION id="mSection"><H3 style="text-align: center;">DaHyeon Choi</H3><P style="text-align: center;">Junior, CSIA</P><P>I’ve been interested in diagnostic biotechnology since childhood. iGEM was a great opportunity for me to fulfill this vision. I hope to reach beyond the limits of classroom science and not only learn and develop new ideas, but also help spread our project to the public. In the team I was the main wiki and web developer, a role where I orchestrated the planning, creation, design and development of wiki and computer related parts of the project. I also participated in writing articles, experimentation and  human practices. I’m deeply curious about the universe and have interests in a variety of fields, including computers, biotechnology, and writing.
