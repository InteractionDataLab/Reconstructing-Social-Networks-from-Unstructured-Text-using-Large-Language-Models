General Laboratory Safety
Our lab is classified as Biosafety Level 1, which means the lab uses microbes that pose little to no risk to healthy individuals. Prior to starting lab work, the team completed safety documentation, online safety modules, and physical safety workshops. We took the requirements of lab work and project safety very seriously by carefully studying safety protocols and preparing our work surroundings.
General Laboratory Safety Addressed the Following:
Decontamination of materials prior to disposal, using an autoclave
Personal protective equipment (lab coats, eye protection, and gloves)
Building and chemical safety
Prohibition of food, drinks, any smokable materials, etc.
Our guidelines, taken from Industry-University Cooperation Foundation of CHA University, cover many safety rules and procedures ranging from lab specific rules to behavior.
Project Specific Laboratory Safety
Escherichia coli DH5-alpha: E. coli DH5-alpha is one of the most safe and common lab strains; the genotype is F-80dlacZM15 (lacZYA-argF) U169hsdR17 (r-m+) recA1 endA1 relA1 deoR. The strain is a non-colonial and cannot permanently form colonies in the digestive tract of a healthy person or animal. A common genetic engineering experiment using the strain can be performed safely under BSL 1 conditions.
RedSafe™ nucleic acid staining solution: RedSafe™ nucleic acid staining solution is an alternative to the traditional ethidium bromide (EtBr) stain for detecting nucleic acid in agarose gels. The protocol is also similar with a protocol of EtBr. The Ames test proves lower mutation than RedSafe™ nucleic acid staining solution; Comparable to EtBr. RedSafe™ nucleic acid staining solution (20,000x) has a negative result in mouse marrow chromophilous erythrocyte micronucleus tests and mouse spermary spermatocyte chromosomal aberration tests (http://jhscience.com/product_info.php?products_id=2).
Piranha solution: Piranha solutions are a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid with hydrogen peroxide, usually in a ratio of 3:1 to 7:1. They are used to remove amounts of organic residues, such as photoresist, from substrates. All handling of piranha solutions must be done in a properly functioning fume hood compatible for acid use. Before you begin, lower the sash as much as possible to provide a barrier. The sash should be raised no higher than 18 inches (marked with an arrow on the test sticker) to properly capture fumes (https://www.drs.illinois.edu/SafetyLibrary/PiranhaSolutions).
Isopropyl alcohol: Isopropyl alcohol is a colorless liquid found in household and workplace products alike. Due to its high flammability and potential health hazards, it is important to handle isopropyl alcohol in a safe manner no matter what the setting. Pure isopropyl is considered to be a toxic substance to humans, as it is known to readily absorb through the skin. As an alcohol, it is highly flammable in the presence of heat, sparks, or an open flame. When handling isopropyl alcohol in a work environment, protective clothing should be always be worn, including safety gloves and goggles. The area should also be well-ventilated and have a wash station nearby (https://www.msdsonline.com/2015/02/20/isopropyl-alcohol-safety-tips-from-msdsonline/).
