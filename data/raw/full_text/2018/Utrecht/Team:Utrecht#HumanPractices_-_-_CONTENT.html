Synthetic biology-based systems are sustainable, innovative and have many possibilities. While developing systems it is important to look for the most suitable, safe and widely accepted application. To determine what problem would be most relevant and best suitable for our system, it was essential to acquire information of both experts and stakeholders. This shaped the focus of our social relevance, which started as a detection method for botulism and shifted towards a system aiding detection of oestrogens and oestrogen-like compounds. Furthermore, the extensive feedback aided the design of a device that is convenient to use, low-cost, safe and meets all other stakeholder requirements. To give an impression of the evolution of our project, the project timeline is illustrated below. A summary of the most influential insights is provided in the last section, underneath the infographic.</P></DIV><DIV class="customelementM5B transparent timeline" id="Timeline"><DIV class="customelementC2" style="top: 3%;left: 5%;width: 27%;"><H4> Pim Klaassen, Niek Savelkoul, Jaco Westra and Korienke Smit, RIVM </H4><I>14/05/18</I><B>About RIVM</B><P>The RIVM is the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment.

Safety, low-costs and rapidly available quantified data were leading values in both project and product design processes. All requirements and difficulties emanating from the interactions were considered and integrated into the project, which is summarized below.</P><H4>Finding a suitable application</H4><P>We commenced with a method detecting botulism toxin in surface water, a serious issue for both wild animals and humans. In this case, quick demonstration of botulism presence and finding its source is important. However, upon discussing the topic with experts of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), we decided that introduction of GMO into the environment would not be feasible. Therefore, we shifted our attention to the application of the sensor as a lab tool to measure the presence of a certain compound. </P><P>Since our system was not specifically aimed at botulism toxins, the decision was made to detect toxins in food. However, after a literature search we concluded that the size of toxins would be too large to be able to be detected by our system. This lead us to focus on the detection of small molecules in food. Jos van der Vosse from the Netherlands Organisation for applied scientific research (TNO) advised us to focus on the detection of small molecules in water, since in this area measured concentrations are supposedly lower. Furthermore, he recommended us to assure the quantification of the signal and preferentially the concentrations as well.</P><P>Onno Epema from Rijkswaterstaat (part of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management) pointed out the importance of pharmaceutical waste products in water, for which our system could improve the detection.</P><P>Surface water contaminants contain a wide variety of compounds, all with a different ecological impact. The meeting with Martin van den Berg, Deputy Director of the Institute Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS), guided us to focus on one of the forthcoming most hazardous emerging contaminants: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI). These hormone mimicking compounds are used as antidepressant, and include pharmaceuticals such as Prozac. Even in low concentrations SSRIs are pharmacological active in vertebrates and have an ecological impact.</P><P>The interactions with both stakeholders and experts provided us with a number of applications for our biosensor, such as a pre-check for the chemical analysis and local sampling. To enable the use of DeTaXion to these ends, multiple requirements had to be integrated into the applied design. Key values for this purpose were that the device has to be quick, safe, accurate and quantitative. More information on our applied design and the integration of insights of experts and stakeholders can be found on the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Utrecht/Applied_Design">Applied Design page</A>.</P></DIV><DIV class="customelementM5B" id="Ethics"><H3>Ethical issues among GMO’s and Detaxion</H3><P>The use of GMO has increasingly come under scrutiny in a range of different fields, with public resistance mainly focussed on its appearance in our diet. Herein, the application of the GMO matters: use of GM animals for the production of pharmaceuticals is viewed far less negatively than use for food (PEGASUS. (2012). Final Report - PEGASUS (Public perception of genetically modified animals - science, utility and society). European Commission CORDIS, United Kingdom). Being a subject of strong debate, it is important to ascertain these ethical concerns for our project and product design, as our biosensor naturally is a GMO. As our sensor is best utilized directly in the field, it is implied that our genetically modified bacteria leave the laboratory to enter the outside world - safely contained within our device - leading to the primary concern of introduction into the environment. This introduction of a modified bacterium is potentially harmful, as it could disrupt ecosystems, introduce antibiotic resistances in other species, and have harmful health effects on humans. These concerns were echoed by Martin van den Berg (deputy director of the Institute of Risk Assessment Sciences), who stressed the importance of containment of our <I>E.coli</I> within our device to prevent introduction. Our device therefore contains a number of safety measures to prevent this, such as adequate sealing and storage, and stringent cleaning and washing steps. For more information on how we integrated these safety issues into our applied design, visit our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Utrecht/Applied_Design">applied design page</A>. Bacteria themselves also contain a number of safety measures: it is firstly comprised of a weak lab strain, with poor survival chances as a result. The bacteria also contain a killswitch-system preventing survival outside of the device. With this approach, we ensure safe use of our device outside of the laboratory.</P><P>Ultimately, utilitarian ethics plays a large role in the public perception of GMO. If the public is sufficiently aware of the urgency and importance of achieving a specific goal, it will be more likely to be open to the use of GMO (Hersh, M. A. (2002). Ethical analysis of automation: a comparison of different ethical theories through case studies. IFAC Proceedings Volumes, 35(1), 351-356.). In the case of our biosensor we theorize this means that the public is likely to be more open to the use of GMO, as the potentially harmful effects of pharmaceutical pollution are not currently being addressed sufficiently. Multiple experts confirmed this sentiment: as long as the genetically modified bacteria in our device are safely contained, a majority of people will not oppose their use due to their important utility in solving the detection problem of pharmaceutical pollution (Martin van den Berg, Institute of Risk Assessment Sciences). In a similar vein, our biosensor makes current detection methods (i.e. those utilizing Daphniae and fish) redundant, leading to a reduction in the use of laboratory animals.</P></DIV><DIV class="navigateArrows"><DIV class="arrowLeft"><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Utrecht/Overview"> Project Description</A></DIV><DIV class="arrowRight"><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Utrecht/Design">Project Design </A></DIV><DIV class="arrowRight"><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Utrecht/Applied_Design">Applied Design </A></DIV><DIV class="arrowLeft"><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Utrecht/Public_Engagement">Public Engagement </A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
