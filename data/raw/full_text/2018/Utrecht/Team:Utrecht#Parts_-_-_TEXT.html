Introduction
Parts Acquired
Parts Created
Several biobricks from the distribution kit were used during our project. These were retrieved from the kit using the protocols provided by iGEM , transformed into E. coli and isolated in elution buffer NE. We also ordered several constructs from IDT (Table 1). These Biobricks were used to create several new biobricks that were relevant to our project. BBa_K2736101 and BBa_K2736103 , were created to be used as BRET pair to measure the activity of our customized Tar receptors (BBa_K2736106 , BBa_K2736108 ). To test whether it was possible to switch ligand binding domains of the Tar receptor and two component receptors we created BBa_K2736105 , and BBa_K2736109 . During our project we proved the functionallity of the parts BBa_K2736101 and BBa_K2736105 , which were submitted to the registery.
