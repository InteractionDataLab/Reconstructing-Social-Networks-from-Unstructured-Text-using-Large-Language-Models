Protocols
</H1><H4>Assay Protocol:</H4><P>This protocol relates to the assay that was made regarding whether 3-methylcatechol has been ingested in our fragments or not:</P><H4>
Preparation:
</H4><P>1. 96 well plate </P><P>2. 0.0124g of 3-methylcatechol</P><P>3. 5mL of dH2O</P><P>4. todE fragment</P><P>5. todE + RBS fragment</P><P>6. Lysis buffer (negative control)</P><P>7. Lysate (positive control)</P><P>8. dH2O</P><P>9. 96 well plate reader</P><H4>Protocol:</H4><P>1. Weigh out 0.0124g of 3-methylcatechol. Dissolve it in 5mL of dH2O in a small glass flask. Invert the solution until 3-methylcatechol has fully dissolved in water. (Colour change will occur gradually). </P><P>2. In the 96 well plates, pipette 90 uL of todE fragment from 0h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h and 24h lysate in duplicates. </P><P>3. Similarly, pipette 90 uL of todE + RBS fragment from 0h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h and 24h lysate in duplicates. </P><P>4. Do not add 10 uL of 3-methylcatechol to step 2 and 3 until all the other wells have been filled. </P><P>5. In the next well, pipette 90 uL of the negative control, lysis buffer, into the wells in duplicates. Then, add 10 uL of dH2O. </P><P>6. In the next well, pipette 90 uL of the positive control, lysate, of each todE and todE + RBS fragments in duplicates. </P><P>7. Pipette 10 uL of 3-methylcatechol to the wells that require it. Immediately after that is done, insert the plate into the 96 well plate reader. </P><P>8. Read the plate every minute. </P><P>9. Using Excel, graph the growth curve.</P><H5>
Table 1. Illustrates the positions of each solution in each well. 
</H5><H4>Agar Preparation</H4><H4>Materials:</H4><P>1. 35mg/L agar powder</P><P>2. Distilled water</P><P>3. Any antibiotics required</P><P>4. Ampicillin /Carbenicillin (Red)</P><P>5.Chloramphenicol (Green)</P><P>6. Kanamycin (Blue)</P><P>7. T etracycline (Black)</P><H4>Procedure:</H4><H4>Part 1</H4><P>1. Weigh out the agar powder, 35mg per litre. If you are preparing 500ml, you need 17.5mg etc.</P><P>2. Add it to the bottle, add the required amount of distilled water. Mix it by shaking it</P><P>3. Autoclave it. </P><H4>Part 2</H4><P>4. It’s best to pick it up from the autoclave while it’s still hot. Have your agar, antibiotics and plates ready. </P><P>5. Clean your working bench with ethanol. Use Bunsen burner if you are not working underneath a hood. </P><P>6. Wait till the agar is cool enough to touch. If you can’t hold the agar in the bottle comfortably for like 30seconds, then it’s not ready to be poured into plates. </P><P>7. Add the antibiotics [if needed]. 1 microlitre per 1ml. For 500ml agar, you need to add 500microlitre. </P><P>8. Pour 20ml agar per plate. (500ml makes roughly 25 plates). Don’t put the lid on yet. Just put it half-way on. </P><P>9. Let the agar is set, close the lids. Use parafilm around the plates and store then in the 4 degrees fridge upside down. </P><H4>Assaying competency</H4><H4>Introduction</H4><P>In order to ensure that our bacteria are competent and able to take up new plasmids, we will need to perform a competency assay. </P><H4>Materials:</H4><P>1. Frozen DNA stock</P><P>2. 10 pg/µL pcDNA3.1 aliquoted in 15 µL stocks, frozen at -80°C</P><P>3. LB media</P><P>4. Bacteria (E.Coli)</P><H4>Procedure</H4><H4>Transforming the competent cells:</H4><P>A) 20 pg DNA (2µL)</P><P>B) 100 pg DNA (10 µL)</P><H4>Recovery stage of transformations</H4><P>1. Add 900µL LB media to both and incubate 60 min at 37°C</P><P>2. Plate 100 µL of both on LB + Ampicillin plates (2 plates for each)</P><P>3. Place plates at 37°C overnight</P><P>4. Next morning count colonies (colony forming units, cfu)</P><H4>Determining efficiency of transformation:</H4><P>1. Good competent cells should be 1x10↑7 to 1x10↑8 cfu/µg</P><P>2. Usable competent cells will be 1x10↑6 cfu/µg</P><P>T3. he efficiency will be adversely affected by ligations, plasmid size, relaxed (non-supercoiled) state of plasmid DNA.</P><H5>

Restriction Enzymes: EcoRI, SpeI, XbaI, PstI</P><H4>Equipment:</H4><P>1. Ice and bucket/container</P><P>2. Thermal cycler or heating block</P><H4>Method:</H4><P>1. Add 250 ng of DNA to be digested, and adjust with dH20 for a total volume of 16ul.</P><P>2. Add 2.5ul of NEBuffer 2.</P><P>3. Add 0.5ul of BSA.</P><P>4. Add 0.5ul of EcoRI.</P><P>5. Add 0.5ul of PstI.</P><P>There should be a total volume of 20ul. Mix well and spin down briefly.</P><P>Incubate the restriction digest at 37C for 30min, and then 80C for 20min to heat kill the enzymes. We incubate in a thermal cycler with a heated lid</P><P>Run a portion of the digest on a gel (8ul, 100ng), to check that both plasmid backbone and part length are accurate.</P><H4>Ligation protocol (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Help:Protocols/Ligation">Link</A>)</H4><P>After following our restriction digest protocol (which uses 250ng of DNA) you may follow these steps for ligation.</P><H4>Method:</H4><P>1. Add 2ul of digested plasmid backbone (25 ng)</P><P>2. Add equimolar amount of EcoRI-HF SpeI digested fragment (&lt; 3 ul)</P><P>3. Add equimolar amount of XbaI PstI digested fragment (&lt; 3 ul)</P><P>4. Add 1 ul T4 DNA ligase buffer. Note: Do not use quick ligase</P><P>5. Add 0.5 ul T4 DNA ligase</P><P>6. Add water to 10 ul</P><P>7. Ligate 16C/30 min, heat kill 80C/20 min</P><P>8. Transform with 1-2 ul of product</P><P><P1>Note: For linearized plasmid backbones provided by iGEM HQ, a plasmid backbone with an insert of BBa_J04450 was used as the template. As a result, any red colonies that appear during your ligation may be due to the template as a background. Digesting with Dpn1 before use should reduce this occurrence.</P1></P><H4>Illustra plasmidPrep Mini Spin Kit Protocol</H4><P>Protocol for 1.5 ml and 3 ml culture volumes</P><H4>1.

<H4>Competent cells protocol</H4><H4>Overview:</H4><P>This protocol is a variant of the Hanahan protocol Hanahan91 using the CCMB80 buffer for DH10B, TOP10 and MachI strains. It builds on Example 2 of the Bloom05 patent as well. This protocol has been tested on NEB10, TOP10, MachI and BL21(DE3) cells. See OWW Bacterial Transformation page for a more general discussion of other techniques. The Jesse '464 patent describes using this buffer for DH5α cells. The Bloom04 patent describes the use of essentially the same protocol for the Invitrogen Mach 1 cells.</P><H4>Seed Stock Protocol</H4><H4>Before You Start</H4><P><P1>Estimated bench time: 30 min</P1><P1>Estimated total time: 2 hours (plus 2x 14-16 hour incubations)</P1></P><P>You can prepare stocks of your bacteria of interest and store at -80°C to seed future batches of competent cells.</P><P>Detergent is a major inhibitor of competent cell growth and transformation. Glass and plastic must be detergent free for these protocols. The easiest way to do this is to avoid washing glassware, and simply rinse it out.

</P><P>2. Table-top OD600nm spectrophotometer
 
</P><H4>Method:</H4><P>1. Ethanol treat all working areas for sterility.</P><P>2. Inoculate 250 ml of SOB medium with 1 ml vial of seed stock and grow at 20°C to an OD600nm of 0.3. Use the &quot;cell culture&quot; function on the Nanodrop to determine OD value. </P><P>a. OD value = 600nm Abs reading x 10</P><P>b. This takes approximately 16 hours.</P><P>c. Controlling the temperature makes this a more reproducible process, but is not essential.</P><P>d. Room temperature will work. You can adjust this temperature somewhat to fit your schedule</P><P>3. Aim for lower, not higher OD if you can't hit this mark</P><P>4. Fill an ice bucket halfway with ice. Use the ice to pre-chill as many flat bottom centrifuge bottles as needed.</P><P>a. Transfer the culture to the flat bottom centrifuge tubes. Weigh and balance the tubes using a scale</P><P>5. Try to get the weights as close as possible, within 1 gram.</P><P>a. Centrifuge at 3000g at 4°C for 10 minutes in a flat bottom centrifuge bottle.</P><P>6. Flat bottom centrifuge tubes make the fragile cells much easier to resuspend</P><P>7.

Use Nanodrop to measure OD of a mixture of 200 μl SOC and 50 μl of the resuspended cells</P><P>12. Use a mixture of 200 μl SOC and 50 μl CCMB80 buffer as the blank</P><P>13. Add chilled CCMB80 to yield a final OD of 1.0-1.5 in this test.</P><P>a. Incubate on ice for 20 minutes. Prepare for aliquoting</P><P>b. Make labels for aliquots. Use these to label storage microcentrifuge tubes/microtiter plates</P><P>14. Prepare dry ice in a separate ice bucket. Pre-chill tubes/plates on dry ice.</P><P>15. Aliquot into chilled 2ml microcentrifuge tubes or 50 μl into chilled microtiter plates</P><P>a. Store at -80°C indefinitely.</P><P>16. Flash freezing does not appear to be necessary </P><P>a.
