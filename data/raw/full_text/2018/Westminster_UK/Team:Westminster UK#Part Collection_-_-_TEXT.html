todE
todE coding sequence encoding 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase
TodE belongs to a group of enzymes called catechol-2,3-dioxygenases (C23Os). TodE specifically encodes for the enzyme 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase. This enzyme is part of a series of enzymes responsible for the degradation of aromatic compounds such as toluene, xylene and benzene and their incorporation into the cell metabolism as a carbon source. It is naturally most effective and responsible for the initial cleavage of the 3-methylcatechol intermediate to produce the meta fission product (MFP) 2-hydroxy6-oxo-methylhexa-2,4-dienoate (6-methyl HODA).
todX
todX coding sequence encoding for outer membrane transport protein
Pertaining to a subfamily of the FadL family, todX codes for an outer membrane channel protein that is responsible for allowing entry of hydrophobic compounds entry across the membrane. The gene belongs to the toluene operon which is responsible for the biodegradation of aromatic compounds such as toluene, xylene and benzene and their incorporation as a carbon source.
