iGEM Team Collaboration
Taipei American School & University of Georgia
A significant component in validating the accuracy and precision of our ElectroPen was understanding the repeatability of results. The TASTaipei and UGA teams were instrumental in proving our ElectroPen works in the real world. Both teams were not only able to successfully electroporate E. coli cells, but also obtained results similar to those from the trials conducted by Lambert's own team. We are very grateful for the collaborations between two iGEM teams without whose time and efforts we could not have proven our Electropen hardware.  Thank you TASTaipei and UGA!
TASTaipei received an assembled ElectroPen from us and built a custom cuvette from protocols that we provided. Using these, they prepared electrocompetent DH5a and Nissile 1917 E. coli.  They were able to successfully transform both strains with a GFP plasmid and provided transformation efficiency data.  UGA’s team also received an assembled ElectroPen and cuvette from us for testing.  They were also able to successfully transform and validate GFP expression with a plate reader.  Both teams gave us feedback on design and ease of use of the devices.
For more on the ElectroPen, visit our ElectroPen page.
Nanjing-China
Lambert iGEM created a lab emoji in collaboration with Team Nanjing. The teams hoped to increase accessibility of science to the community. It was an activity that allowed Lambert iGEM to consider the fun of science rather than always focusing on its serious effects. This mindset set allowed a more relaxed, inviting lab environment and an overall better iGEM experience. Team Nanjing also used our app Color Q, testing and proving its functionality. They gave us great feedback on versatility and accessibility, changes that we took to heart. Here are their results:
Team Nanjing-China shares their results.
Westminster UK
Due to limited resources, the Lambert iGEM team understands the significance of conservation and frugality in the lab. In fact, frugal science remains a foundation of our project. In collaboration with Westminster UK iGEM, the team developed a protocol to recycle spin columns without an autoclave, promoting an easy method of increased conservation in the lab.
Recyling Spin Columns
Store unclean spin columns in 1M HCl solution for 4 hours or overnight (No damage if stored for longer).
Fill each column with 1 ml sterile distilled H2O.
Spin columns in microcentrifuge (inside microcentrifuge tubes or collection tubes).
Discard the flow through.
Repeat steps 2-4, 4 more times for a total of 5 times.
Fill with 1 ml of QBT buffer to rebalance charges.
Spin columns in microcentrifuge (inside microcentrifuge or collection tubes).
Discard the flow through.
Repeat steps 6-8, 4 more times for a total of 5 times.
Data shows that recycled spin columns yield similar results to new spin columns in minipreps.
ECUST
Lambert iGEM sent a summary of this year’s project to ECUST. The word restriction encouraged the team to formulate a concise and clear description - a crucial factor to consider when writing an abstract. Additionally, by simplifying the project description, we made it more accessible to the general public.
Uppsala
Lambert iGEM recognizes that synthetic biology requires a lot of hard work and can often result in high stress levels. This can cause extremely dedicated members to feel discouraged or “burned out”. Team Uppsala created a survey addressing this issue. The survey allowed iGEM members to recognize and to address their issues with iGEM-related stress.
Exeter
Since both Lambert’s and Exeter’s 2018 iGEM project are based on water quality, the collaboration between both iGEM teams allowed members to investigate the source of the cause of poor water quality. Exeter iGEM asked for specific water quality reports in the United States. Researching this topic allowed Lambert iGEM to reevaluate this issue in the community, focusing in from the worldwide issue of clean water shortage.
Dalhousie
Since both Lambert’s and Dalhousie’s 2018 iGEM project are based on water quality, the collaboration between both iGEM teams allowed members to investigate the source of the cause of poor water quality.
