Overview
A critical component of measurement and modeling in synthetic biology involves standardization of values to ensure accurate conversion and comparison of data between different experiments for validation. Reproducibility has therefore become a necessity for confirmation of results in various experiments, as well as providing a sufficient standard of comparison. The InterLab study aims to address this goal through the characterization of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) with studies conducted by labs across the world. As GFP is utilized as an almost universal reporter in experiments, it is crucial for standardizing fluorescence values for comparison. Lambert iGEM shares this vision of reproducibility in synthetic biology and participated in the InterLab to help achieve this goal.
In the spirit of collaboration, we worked with the University of Georgia iGEM Team to conduct our experiments and compare results in order to optimize protocols and recognize changes that can be made to ensure increased reproducibility. We performed our experiments and obtained measurements in tandem to limit variables, and analyzed our measurement curves to compare differences. One of the critical components we realized affected the measurements was a reconstitution of the particle solution and the time the particles were allowed to settle. We resuspended the particles after obtaining plate reader data indicating that was the factor affecting the values. Throughout this experience, we have learned the critical need for reproducibility and hope to pursue future opportunities with the InterLab study!
