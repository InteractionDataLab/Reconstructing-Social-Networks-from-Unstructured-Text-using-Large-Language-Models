Wet Lab Summary
Lambert iGEM utilized a toehold switch and a trigger - which corresponds with RNA sequences of the ctxB1 cholera gene - in a biosensor system. If the trigger sequence is present and binds to the toehold switch, then a blue pigment produced by LacZ appears in the cells.
The construct above displays the proof of concept T7 LacZ switch and trigger. The switch consists of T7 promoter, a strong constitutive promoter, along with LacZ as the reporter gene. The trigger was cloned into a high copy plasmid while the switch was cloned into a low copy plasmid to ensure the replication of two different plasmids for the E. coli cell to produce proportional amounts.
Work Flow
The 2018 Lambert iGEM team conducted the following experiments to assemble the proof the concept T7 LacZ toehold switch and Cholera switch.  We ordered three potential Cholera toehold switches and triggers and proceeded to perform PCRs on each of the parts. All switches and triggers were amplified and validated through gel electrophoresis [Figure 1.]. With purified PCR products of the switches, triggers, and their correlating vectors, we ligated each of these parts into their vectors through Gibson Assembly. Dual plasmid transformations and single transformations were conducted with BL21 T7 E. coli

1.2 Centrifuge at 2500xg for 5 minutes at room temperature. Decant or aspirate and discard the culture media. (Original protocol called for 10,000xg for 1 minute, but the speed and time above seemed to produce better results.)
1.2.1 Original protocol called for 10,000xg for 1 minute, but the speed and time above seemed to produce better results.
1.3 Add 250uL of Solution I mixed with RNase A (pre-added). Vortex to mix thoroughly. Transfer the suspension into a new 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube.
1.4 Add 250uL of Solution II. Invert several times until you get a clear lysate.
1.4.1 Once Solution II is added, do not let it sit for more than 5 minutes!
1.5 Add 350uL of Solution III. Invert several times until white precipitate forms. Centrifuge at 13,000xg or 17,900rcf for 10 minutes. A compact white pellet should form at the bottom of the tube.
1.6 Insert a mini-column into a 2mL collection tube.
1.7 Transfer the clear supernatant into the mini-column using a micropipette. Centrifuge at the maximum speed (13,000xg) for 60 seconds. Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.
1.7.1 Be careful not to get any parts of the pellet! Tilt at an angle with the pellet at the top when micropipetting is advisable.
1.7.2 Think about what you are discarding versus what you want to keep!

2.7 Write down measurements for the concentration of DNA (in ng/uL), A260, A280, 260/280 (should be around 1.8), and 260/230 (should be around 2.1).
Digest
3.1 Dilute up to 1ug DNA to 17uL with dH₂O.

Analysis
The negative control showed a limited growth of e.coli colonies. The positive control had no growth meaning the microfilter was effectively filtered out all growth. Having used a blue t-shirt, we found that the water ran through turned blue. For the cheesecloth, only 50ml of water came out and it appeared to be yellow. All tested variables had more growth than the negative control, showing that there was a source of contamination in the experiment. However, coffee filter and muslin appeared to have the least e.coli growth showing they could possibly be effective for filtration. This experiment did not conclusively show whether coffee filter or muslin was more effective so we will repeat the experiment with coffee filters and muslin.
