Project Foundation
This year's project toehold switch circuit design was a result of collaborative discussions with Dr. Styczysnki, Ms. Zhang and Ms. McNerney from Georgia Institute of Technology. Lambert iGEM worked extensively with third parties for this year's project, and we would like to offer our most sincere thanks for their help. Attributions are listed below by subproject.

Dr. Mark Styczynski from Georgia Institute of Technology
Dr. Saad Bhamla from Georgia Institute of Technology
Ms. Yan Zhang from Georgia Institute of Technology
Ms. Monica McNerney from Georgia Institute of Technology
Dr. Styczynski, Dr. Bhamla, Ms. Zhang and Ms. McNerney have assisted Lambert iGEM throughout their project by acting as mentors. They have helped the team troubleshoot and revise its project, constantly providing advice to improve it. In addition, they have generously provided materials that a high school team would not have access to. We would like to thank them for helping us complete our project.
