Atlanta Science Festival is a nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing people together through the wonders of science. This organization was founded in 2014 by Emory University, Georgia Tech, and Metro Atlanta Chamber. This event is an annual two-week festival that celebrates local science and technology, featuring more than 100 events and reaching 50,000 children and adults annually. 
Festival events feature hands-on activities, tours, tastings, and performances from more than 100 partner organizations. 
Lambert iGEM participated in the Atlanta Science Festival in order to increase the public’s knowledge of synthetic biology. Through collaboration with the Georgia State iGEM team, Lambert iGEM helped children create art with micropipettes and color dye. This simple experiment helped spark interests in science.

A few members of the Lambert iGEM team participated in a summer camp hosted by GSU for deaf students in the Atlanta area. This camp walked students through labs such as DNA barcoding and gel electrophoresis, which were meant to give students with disabilities the opportunity to gain experience in the field of synthetic biology. This camp was a continuation of GSU’s previous project, in which they created new signs in ASL in order to create a larger science-based vocabulary for deaf students.

The Lambert iGEM team invited the UGA iGEM team. Five UGA members came over to assist Lambert iGEM members with experiments and lectures. 

UGA students, Stephan George, Chynna Pollitt, Kelton McConnell, &amp; Arjun Bhatt, helped us prepare labs such as the Transformation lab and DNA lab. They spoke to us about working in a college lab and experiences that they have had.

Lambert iGEM planned a Georgia meetup, which took place at Emory University. iGEM teams from Emory University and Georgia State came together. We discussed our projects and had a question and answer session. This meetup allowed us to brainstorm ideas together and to interact with other iGEM team members.

A significant component in validating the accuracy and precision of our ElectroPen was understanding the repeatability of results. The TASTaipei and UGA teams were instrumental in proving our ElectroPen works in the real world. Both teams were not only able to successfully electroporate <I>E. coli</I> cells, but also obtained results similar to those from the trials conducted by Lambert's own team. We are very grateful for the collaborations between two iGEM teams without whose time and efforts we could not have proven our Electropen hardware.  Thank you TASTaipei and UGA! 
TASTaipei received an assembled ElectroPen from us and built a custom cuvette from protocols that we provided. Using these, they prepared electrocompetent DH5a and <I>Nissile</I> 1917 E. coli.  They were able to successfully transform both strains with a GFP plasmid and provided transformation efficiency data.  UGA’s team also received an assembled ElectroPen and cuvette from us for testing.  They were also able to successfully transform and validate GFP expression with a plate reader.  Both teams gave us feedback on design and ease of use of the devices.

Lambert iGEM created a lab emoji in collaboration with Team Nanjing. The teams hoped to increase accessibility of science to the community. It was an activity that allowed Lambert iGEM to consider the fun of science rather than always focusing on its serious effects. This mindset set allowed a more relaxed, inviting lab environment and an overall better iGEM experience. Team Nanjing also used our app Color Q, testing and proving its functionality. They gave us great feedback on versatility and accessibility, changes that we took to heart. Here are their results:

Due to limited resources, the Lambert iGEM team understands the significance of conservation and frugality in the lab. In fact, frugal science remains a foundation of our project. In collaboration with Westminster UK iGEM, the team developed a protocol to recycle spin columns without an autoclave, promoting an easy method of increased conservation in the lab.

Lambert iGEM sent a summary of this year’s project to ECUST. The word restriction encouraged the team to formulate a concise and clear description - a crucial factor to consider when writing an abstract. Additionally, by simplifying the project description, we made it more accessible to the general public.
</DIV><DIV id="content2"><B style="font-size: 20px;">Uppsala</B>
Lambert iGEM recognizes that synthetic biology requires a lot of hard work and can often result in high stress levels. This can cause extremely dedicated members to feel discouraged or “burned out”. Team Uppsala created a survey addressing this issue. The survey allowed iGEM members to recognize and to address their issues with iGEM-related stress.
</DIV><DIV id="content2"><B style="font-size: 20px;">Exeter</B>
Since both Lambert’s and Exeter’s 2018 iGEM project are based on water quality, the collaboration between both iGEM teams allowed members to investigate the source of the cause of poor water quality. Exeter iGEM asked for specific water quality reports in the United States. Researching this topic allowed Lambert iGEM to reevaluate this issue in the community, focusing in from the worldwide issue of clean water shortage.
</DIV><DIV id="content2"><B style="font-size: 20px;">Dalhousie</B>

</DIV><DIV id="content2"><B style="font-size: 20px;">Imperial College</B>
Lambert iGEM took the Imperial College’s survey on team communication and dynamics. Like all teams, Lambert iGEM has instances of tension and disagreement between members. Taking the survey pushed the team to be open about their issues and work through them, resulting in an improved team bond.
</DIV><DIV id="content2"><B style="font-size: 20px;">UC San Diego</B>
The lab environment of synthetic biology can often be polarizing, as it is a relatively new field. Lambert iGEM participated in a survey about iGEM’s goals, needs, and climate to further solidify iGEM and synthetic biology’s direction in the future.
</DIV><DIV id="content2"><B style="font-size: 20px;">US AFRL Carrol</B>
There is a stigma associated with the biotechnology field. This negative perception shared by the public can hinder advancements in synthetic biology. To address this issue, Lambert iGEM posed with US AFRL Carrol’s characters Mike the Microbe and Chia the Chitinase, two lovable animations that appeal to the general public.
</DIV><DIV id="content2"><B style="font-size: 20px;">Bielefeld</B>
Lambert iGEM participated in a survey and lecture about Dual Use, a scientific concern that most iGEM team members are unfamiliar with. Through this collaboration, the team was able to recognize and understand this international ethical issue.
