Parts Overview
T7 Toehold LacZ is a construct that was developed by the Lambert iGEM 2018 team to be applied as a proof of concept for our biosensor. BBa_J23100, a strong T7 promoter is used to ensure expression of the downstream reporter. Between the promoter and LacZ is a new part BBaK2550100 a toehold ribosomal regulator based on the work of the Collins Lab. The reporter of the biosensor utilizes part BBa_I732005 that was submitted by 2007 UTSC iGEM that singularly includes the LacZ lactose operon encoding the Beta-galactosidase protein. Used as a qualitative reporter, the Beta-galactosidase activity in the LacZ gene can be viewed with the naked eye when induced by Xgal.
In order to utilize this biobrick as a biosensor mechanism, Lambert iGEM obtained a LacZ toehold construct assembled with a T7 promoter from the Styczynski Lab at Georgia Institute of Technology. When assembled with a distinct RNA sequence complementary to a specific trigger sequence, the blue pigment expression produced by the LacZ toehold construct can be characterized based on RGB (red green blue) scales using the Chrome Q and Color Q system.
In conjunction with the 2018 project to detect diseases, specifically cholera, in water, Lambert iGEM submitted eight parts to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, seven of which are specific to the ctxB1 gene. Four parts are the T7 Cholera ctxB1 Toehold LacZ constructs, and three parts are the T7 Cholera ctxB1 trigger sequences.
