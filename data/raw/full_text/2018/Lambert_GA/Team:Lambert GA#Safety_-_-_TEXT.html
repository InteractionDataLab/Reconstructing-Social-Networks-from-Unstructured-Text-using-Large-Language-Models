Project Safety
Recognizing the limitations of the current methods utilized for the detection of Cholera, the 2018 Lambert iGEM team will be building a disease detector utilizing RNA-based biosensors called Toehold Switches. This will include engineering E. coli to detect Vibrio cholerae using a short sequence from the gene, ctxB. The Cholera enterotoxin subunit B is a non-toxic gene that is specific to the Vibrio cholerae serotype O1 (strain ATCC 39315), allowing the target sequence to be accurate and safe enough for the detection of Cholera. By developing an RNA-based detection mechanism for Cholera, Lambert iGEM is able to address the epidemic of waterborne diseases at drastically lower costs, without sacrificing on quality or performance, in order to further integrate practical and efficient solutions for Synthetic Biology.
For future implications, the Lambert iGEM team will not be conducting any direct experimentation with Vibrio cholerae, as stated in our check-in form. Any testing with V. cholerae will be conducted under a specialized lab that is authorized to work with these strains.
BL21 DH5-alpha E. coli is our nonpathogenic chassis and was developed for laboratory cloning use. The potential health and environmental hazard associated with BL21 DH5-alpha E. coli hazards are highly limited and can be handled in Biosafety level 1 laboratories.
Hardware & Software Safety
The main safety hazards with our 3D printer are the temperature fluctuation. The nozzle is able to heat up to 220 degrees Celsius. In addition, leaving the printer unattended to can be dangerous due to the 3D printer’s high temperatures, which could cause a potential fire. However, our printer is advanced and possesses mechanisms that prevent this from happening, and the chances of this occurring are extremely low, but if it occurs, it can cause serious damage and end up burning parts of the printer. The printer uses software called Crash Detection and Heat Overload to monitor the overall safety of the printer. The printer will always be monitored by a PI preventing any unwanted accidents.
CALM's SMS surveys do not collect any personal identifying data. The questions in the survey only ask for the governorate in which the responder resides and general health and sanitation questions (e.g. "How many people have you seen with Cholera this week?"). We do not record or process phone numbers.
The voltage output from the ElectroPen is not hazardous to any user due to the low current (scale of nanoamperes to microamperes) equivalent to that of static electricity. The safety risks associated with the ElectroPen can, therefore, be regarded as minimal, and proper handling can include wearing gloves to avoid electric shock.
Discarding of Cells in the Field
The Hsp33 protein is expressed by the gene hslO and confers resistance to oxidative protein unfolding among bacteria cells [1]. Oxidative protein unfolding occurs with treatment of bleach or peroxides at elevated temperatures, but the hslO protein protects the protein elongation factor Tu against it [2]. When cells are under certain stress, such as exposure to hypochlorite, Hsp33 activates in order to prevent oxidative protein unfolding [3].
The easiest way to kill the V. cholera would be to boil the water sample and biosensor cell culture, as the heat denatures protein structure and causes protein aggregation. When proteins begin to clump together, they are unable to function and the cell then dies. Boiling the biosensor cells causes the bonds to break down, resulting in the loss of function in the cell.
However, other sources suggest 1% sodium hypochlorite and 70% ethanol will kill cells. Results show that a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution sprayed on the surface and let sit for five minutes will effectively remove all DNA, saliva, blood, semen, and skin cells from any smooth or pitted surface when wiped down with 70% ethanol afterward. However, sodium hypochlorite solution followed by ethanol can produce amounts of gaseous chlorine above recommended exposure levels. As a result, 1% sodium hypochlorite followed by distilled water was tested and proven to be effective as well [4].
