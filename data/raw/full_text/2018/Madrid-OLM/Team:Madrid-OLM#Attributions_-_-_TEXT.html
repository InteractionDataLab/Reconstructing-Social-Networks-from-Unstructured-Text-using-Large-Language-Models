We express our deepest gratitude to all the people who have made this project possible. Both those who have helped us through funding, and all those who have helped us with their advice, giving us materials or reagents and protocols. This includes all the teachers, researchers and colleagues who have supported and advised us. Also, we express our gratitude to the universities, companies and public entities that have supported us through the cessation of laboratories, places to organize congresses and conferences held throughout the process. The trust that has been placed in us has been immense, despite being just students. We know that you are busy people, and still, you have taken time to attend us and clear out a lot of doubts. That is something not everyone does, and for that, we want to reiterate our deepest gratitude. If something big comes out from this project, it will be because of your help.

Francisco Javier Quero Lombardero has worked both in the wet lab and the manufacturing sections. In the laboratory, he has worked in the aptamer discovery, characterization and integration sections. Related to aptamer discovery, he has designed and manufactured the nitrocellulose columns and its implementation. He has also designed the qPCR experiments for SELEX round checking. In the aptamer characterization, he has worked testing the different aptamer characterization techniques as well as developing the final one: the ELONA. He has also carried out the experiments to integrate the aptamer into the electrode. In the hardware section, he has worked designing the PDMS chips and making the manufacturing process (hacking the laser cutter, developing plasma generation, helping with vacuum chamber fabrication…). He has also designed, assembled and tested all the electronics. Regarding the software, he has written the code of every control component of the system (Arduino, Rodeostat, and PC). He has also contacted the sponsors to raise funds.
Laura Armero Hernández has worked in the aptamer discovery section by performing and sharpened the SELEX process, for both proteins (BSA and OLE-E1), and designing the qPCR experiments for SELEX round checking. She has also contributed to the final aptamer characterization technique: the ELONA. She has liaised with administrative chores of the team, as looking for funding.
Rodrigo Hernandez Cifuentes has worked in the hardware section, developing the electromechanical systems for the device: microfluidics chips, pressure pumps, a design-oriented to manufacturing and the overall integration of the subsystems into a piece of hardware. From the experimental side, he has been involved in hacking the microwave, the laser cutter, the compressor-pump transformation, setting up of the vacuum chamber, generating plasma, assembling the designs. He has also contributed to the electrochemical measurement.
Iván Martín Hernández was responsible for the elaboration, management and development of the wiki. In the aptamer section, he was in charge of the computational improvement of the aptamers. He has collaborated with Tec-Monterrey team. He also helped in the laboratory when needed. He represented the team in the "Mediterranean" meet up and in the "Spanish" meet up.
Borja Sánchez Clemente has worked in the design and signal processing of the optical prototype. He has also helped with the electrochemical measurement.
Ignacio Albert Smet has worked in the design and signal processing of the optical prototype. He has also helped with the Human Practices and organizing the “Anooother European” meetup.
Guillermo Fernández Rodríguez has worked on the Interlab experiment and on the aptamer characterization section (ELONA).
Gonzalo Saiz Gonzalo has worked on the Interlab protocol. He has also helped to look for sponsors. He represented the team in the "Mediterranean" meet up and helped with the iGEM guide for new teams in Spain.
Mentors
Domingo Marquina Díaz was the principal PI of the team. He was the first person to believe in the project, helped us developing it, encouraged and supervised us during the journey.
Rafael Alejandro Alonso Conde has helped, as our secondary PI, a lot in different aspects whenever we needed help: management, purchase of materials, manufacture of acrylamide gels and the realization of the Elona protocol.
Maria Teresa Lopez Jaen contributed to develop the initial idea of the project and generously lent us her lab space and equipment to conduct our experiments. She was always free to give us advice or a helping hand.
Cristina Sanchez Garcia has spent all her efforts in obtaining the university support, funds and the materials we have been requiring during the year. Additionally, she has helped to liaise with the administration. She has also promoted the iGEM initiative inside the University and helped us to organize every event related to this matter.
Maria Teresa Villaba Diaz has kindly donated all the protein needed to perform the experiments and answered all our doubts regarding her expertise: the proteins. She was always available for us and wanted to stay updated with our progress, cheering us.
Victor Manuel González Muñoz and Maria Elena Martín Palma: have shared with the team their vast experience in the field of aptamers. They have actively collaborated with the team during all the SELEX and aptamer characterization experiments (even sharing their protocols) and generously lent us their own space at the Ramon y Cajal Institute to conduct two assays alongside them.
Jose Ignacio Klett selflessly spent two days to help the team in the realization of the experiments at the Ramon y Cajal Institute.
Susana Campuzano Ruiz has provided us with knowledgeable advise on the aptamer measurement, leading us to understand the technique and suggesting the best material and equipment to perform the electrode binding.
Victor de Lorenzo he has always shown a good disposition to talk with us and help in the plasmid binding and cloning of biobricks, and making time to give a lecture during the meetup that we hosted.
Tomas Aparicio has helped the team to sketch all the plasmid binding and cloning of the biobricks.
Esther Lantero Bringas has taught us how to clone (the Interlab section would not have been possible without her) and she has supported us all year long.
Helping hands
Marcos Hernandez Cifuentes has helped to develop the final app.
Elena Benito Peña kindly lent us some PDMS, when we run out of it, to continue with our experiments.
Maria del Carmen Moreno Ortiz has been helping us all year long and became essential to our survival in the department.
Pilar Arana always showed interest in our progress and helped us with her experience in DNA amplification.
Yasmina Juarranz generously gave us a space in her department for setting up our hardware lab until the end of the competition and checked on us regularly to see if we needed help.
David Alfaro Sanchez has always been willing to lend the team basic lab material.
Luis Fernández Pacios has provided information and knowledge about protein structure prediction.
Emilia Lopez Solanilla has provided information and knowledge about cloning protocols.
Saul Ares and Krzysztof Wabnik took the time to prepare a lecture for the meetup we hosted.
Pablo Quesada cut with laser all the methacrylate structure for our device.
Marta Montero illustrated and designed the model for our banner.
Jose Antonio Hernández and Felisa Cifuentes provided the needles and syringes.
Javier Gonzalez and Alvaro Ramos are teachers of TEMS School and helped us to organize the presentation that we made in the school.
