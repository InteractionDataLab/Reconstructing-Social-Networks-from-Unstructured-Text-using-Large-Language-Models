In this regard, there were some Fluid Mechanics concepts that we wanted to experiment with. This is why we created the following experiments:</P><OL class="ourlist"><LI><P class="lead"><B>Our mixer:</B> Inside the chip, the fluid behaves in a laminar way. There are many <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4634658/">papers</A> on this topic.We wanted to test this experimentally. And that is why we created a mixer. We could study how the fluid behaves in the conditions of a mixer. Our mixer is just an example on how microfluidic components can be small enough to be modularly assembled in series or in parallel as an electronic component.</P></LI><LI><P class="lead"><B>Flow separation tests:</B> We have designed four experiments to study the behaviour of our flow under different circumstances. The flow circulates towards a triangle, a circle, a throat and the shape of a heart. This will show us how the flow behaves under certain circumstances. Its immediate consequences affect the design of chambers or any microchannel widening.</P></LI><LI><P class="lead"><B>Droplet generation tests:</B> Generating droplets is one of the milestones of microfluidics. Droplets are small volumes of sample moving as small drops in an arranged and harmonic way. It is much more than just beautiful. The main task of this chip is to study how a fluid and air pressure gradients can work together in the same room. The design pushes to the limit the available capabilities of our device.</P></LI><LI><P class="lead"><B>Tree and mixer test:</B> We have designed a large PMMA chip to work as a sample on how fluid behaves when flow is separated into different branches of a tree. The aim of this experiment is to study the laminar flow, and how it behaves when it arrived to the central chamber. On the exact opposite side, a negative relative pressure will be generated to study how it behaves in an alternative “negative relative pressure” tree. In this experiment there are two sides of a chip. Both of them are experimentally equivalent.  </P></LI><LI><P class="lead"><B>A chip adapted to Dropsens GNP110 electrode:</B> We manufactured via regular CNC milling, adapted to micromachining, the housing for a Dropsens GNP110 electrode.
