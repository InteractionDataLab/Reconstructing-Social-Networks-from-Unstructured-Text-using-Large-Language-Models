                                We express our deepest gratitude to all the people who have made this project possible. Both those who have helped us through funding, and all those who have helped us with their advice, giving us materials or reagents and protocols. This includes all the teachers, researchers and colleagues who have supported and advised us. Also, we express our gratitude to the universities, companies and public entities that have supported us through the cessation of laboratories, places to organize congresses and conferences held throughout the process. The trust that has been placed in us has been immense, despite being just students. We know that you are busy people, and still, you have taken time to attend us and clear out a lot of doubts. That is something not everyone does, and for that, we want to reiterate our deepest gratitude. If something big comes out from this project, it will be because of your help.

In the laboratory, he has worked in the aptamer discovery, characterization and integration sections. Related to aptamer discovery, he has designed and manufactured the nitrocellulose columns and its implementation. He has also designed the qPCR experiments for SELEX round checking. In the aptamer characterization, he has worked testing the different aptamer characterization techniques as well as developing the final one: the ELONA. He has also carried out the experiments to integrate the aptamer into the electrode. In the hardware section, he has worked designing the PDMS chips and making the manufacturing process (hacking the laser cutter, developing plasma generation, helping with vacuum chamber fabrication…). He has also designed, assembled and tested all the electronics. Regarding the software, he has written the code of every control component of the system (Arduino, Rodeostat, and PC). He has also contacted the sponsors to raise funds.
