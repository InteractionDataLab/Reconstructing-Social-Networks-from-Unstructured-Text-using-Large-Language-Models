Abstract
Society demands a better understanding of its environment. We require information about our surroundings, from the traffic density to the temperature distribution in the city we live. Generating and interconnecting this big amount of data is what we call the Internet of Things (IoT). There is no standard way of taking biological measurements within the frame of traditional IoT (i.e. the concentration in the air of viruses, toxins, allergens, etc). It is due to the instability of the reactives, the complexity of automating the laboratory protocols and the need of highly sensitive devices. Additionally, the economic cost of biological devices is remarkably high in comparison to traditional IoT gadgets. And this feature is key, as it is mandatory to extract data from a huge number of nodes. Our project deals with this issue, bringing together microfluidics, aptamer-based sensors, an affordable electrochemical metrological system and a big ammount of love.
