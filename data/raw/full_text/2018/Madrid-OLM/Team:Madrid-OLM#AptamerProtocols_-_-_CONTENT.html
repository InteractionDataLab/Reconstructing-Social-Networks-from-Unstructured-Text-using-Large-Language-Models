Our choice was based on the kind of measuring hardware that we have used, a potentiostat. For this variety of measuring system you need a 3-electrodes system (working, reference and counter electrodes). The other parameters of the electrode was choose as follows:</P><LI><P class="lead">We choose Dropsens as our provider, because they are one of the standards in the field, and they are relatively near to our laboratory.</P></LI><LI class="nomargin"><P class="lead">The material of the working electrode was choose as carbon, modified to include gold nanoparticles. The carbon have better electrochemical window than gold or silver (check <A href="http://www.researchgate.net/post/the_advantage_of_glassy_carbon_electrodein_comparsion_with_Au_electrode">this</A> post for more information) and gold are the ideal substrate to join DNA (It only have to be thiolated).</P></LI><H4 class="tittlelist">Ordering the DNA</H4><P class="lead nomargin">To run the first Proof of Concept  we ordered a commercial Thrombin aptamer. Some tips have been took into account for the aptamer adaptation to electrode binding:</P><LI class="nomargin"><P class="lead">Between the DNA and its thiolation in its 5’, we have include a 6 carbon chain after the thiol modification and 15 thymes before the aptamer sequence. The purpose of this modifications was to separate the aptamer from the electrode surface aiming to ensure enough conformational flexibility of the molecule.</P></LI><P class="lead nomargin"><SPAM class="purple">ADVICE</SPAM>: The IDT code for this modification is  /5ThioMC6-D/ </P><LI class="nomargin"><P class="lead">We have order the aptamers to Integrated DNA Technologies as they are one of the competition sponsors.</P></LI><P class="lead nomargin"><SPAM class="red">CAUTION</SPAM>: As the thiolated ends are considerably unstable, they are shipped as they oxidized form. To treat your electrodes with this aptamers you need to reduce them with DTT or TCEP. You could find a complete protocol of this process <A href="http://sfvideo.blob.core.windows.net/sitefinity/docs/default-source/protocol/reduction-protocol-for-thiol-modified-oligonucleotides.pdf">here.</A></P><H4 class="tittlelist">Aptamer Bounding</H4><LI class="nomargin"><P class="lead">[Optional] Depending on your electrodes, it needs to be pre-treated to ensure the correct aptamer binding. For this purpose pipette 50 uL of  H2SO4  0.5M until the electrode are covered and perform 10 cyclic voltammograms from 0V to 1.25V at 100 mV/s of scan rate.</P></LI><P class="lead nomargin"><SPAM class="purple">ADVICE</SPAM>: TWith Dropsens electrodes there is no need to perform this step.</P><LI class="nomargin"><P class="lead">Wash the electrodes three times with deionized water and let them dry under an extraction hood air flow.</P></LI><LI class="nomargin"><P class="lead">Follow the protocol to structure the aptamers in their individual binding buffers.

Be sure of making the step in a humidified chamber.</P><H4 class="tittlelist">Electrodes testing with cyclic voltammetry</H4><LI class="nomargin"><P class="lead">First of all you must calibrate the ideal concentration of the electrode donor solution. For this purpose ferricyanide redox couple  (K3Fe(CN)6and K4Fe(CN)6) was used above a raw electrode without aptamer. After our experiments the optimal concentration was found to be 5mM of each chemical in a 0.1 KCl solution.</P></LI><P class="lead"><SPAM class="purple">ADVICE</SPAM>: In our experience, this concentration could be different depending on things like the quality of your reactives or your electrodes. We encourage you to adjust this value experimentally making some dilutions (0.5X, 2X…).</P><LI class="nomargin"><P class="lead">Cover the electrode with a ferricyanide droplet and connect it to the potentiostat.</P></LI><LI class="nomargin"><P class="lead">Run a preliminar cyclic voltammetry test with a stardart parameters. The ones that have fits better with our hardware <A href="http://iorodeo.com/products/potentiostat-shield">(Rodeostat)</A> was one cycle from -0.3V to 0.3V, with a current limit of 1000 uA, a sample rate of 100 Hz and a scan rate of 0.05 mV/s.</P></LI><LI><P class="lead">After the test have finished, adjust the parameters (voltage range and current limit) to fit the complete curve in your range. A typical Cyclic Voltammetry curve may have a shape similar to a duck.</P></LI><LI><P class="lead">Once you have calibrated the test for raw electrode is time to compare the results between itself and the electrode with aptamer bonded. If your binding process have succeed you must find a decreasement between the current peak of the electrode with aptamers compared to the raw one. This decreasement is proportional to the quantity of aftamer bonded to the electrode surface as they are obstructing the electrons flow through the electrode surface.</P></LI><LI class="nomargin"><P class="lead">To calibrate the minimum quantity of aptamer that you need to achieve your detection limits, you may carry out the same experiment but with different concentrations of the aptamer.  At the end of this experiment you will be able to correlate the quantity of the aptamer bonded to your electrode with the cyclic voltammetry peak.</P></LI><LI class="nomargin"><P class="lead">Now your electrode is prepared to test it with your protein. You may set an incubation time and temperature depending on the individual interaction between each aptamer and protein. There is no protocol here. This will be a part of your individual results and its your work from now to adapt this protocol to your individual case. If your experiment succeed you will see a decreasement of current in the electrode with higher concentrations of aptamers. To see the outcome of our experiments check the results in the device section.</P></LI><H4 class="tittlelist">Troubleshooting</H4><LI class="nomargin"><P class="lead">If after the measurement you can’t see any kind of signal or your noise is too high compared to the signal the problem may be caused by different sources. You should analyze the following things:</P></LI><OL><LI class="nomargin"><P class="lead">Check if you don’t have enough current (current under 30 uA in Rodeostat) or  you have current but so much noise. In the first case you should check the wiring because your circuit isn’t close. In the second case you should check possible noise sources near your system (like magnets or fluorescent lights).</P></LI><P class="lead nomargin"><SPAM class="purple">ADVICE</SPAM>: We have faced this kind of issue when we have connected the electrodes through alligator clips. The connection was not stable enough and the system have low current and too much noise.  The solution was substituting the clips with oscilloscope probes. You could also solder the electrode to copper wires or consider to buy a commercial electrode adaptor. </P><LI class="nomargin"><P class="lead">Check if in the electrode are appearing air bubbles when you run the measurement. This is a symptom of a wrong electrode connection. Check if you haven’t switch the connections of reference and counter electrode.</P></LI><LI class="nomargin"><P class="lead">If no current decreasing have achieve in the electrode with aptamers compared to the raw electrode check if you have followed correctly reduced the aptamers before following the binding protocol. Also check the concentration of aptamers that you have cast above the electrode.</P></LI></OL></OL></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>
