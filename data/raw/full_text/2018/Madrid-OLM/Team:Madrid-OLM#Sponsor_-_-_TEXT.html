Madrid-OLM:Sponsors
Sponsors
It is impossible for our team to participate in this competition without support from various companies. The sponsor supported project expenditure such as experiment cost, team registration fee, Jamboree participation fee.
Main Sponsors
Inmunotek
Inmunotek is a pharmaceutical laboratory based in Madrid that develops, manufactures and markets products for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in the field of allergy and immunology, both for human and veterinary pathology. Inmunotek was founded in 1992 and has products in more than 30 countries in Europe, America, Asia, Oceania and Africa. It also has laboratories for the production of raw materials (bacteria, fungi and mites), as well as specific facilities for the sanitary products it produces.
La Caixa Foundation
The Obra Social la Caixa is the set of social actions carried out by the "la Caixa" Banking Foundation.  This foundation, the first in Spain and one of the most important in the world, supported in 2017, through nearly 48,000 initiatives. The 63% of the Obra Social's resources were allocated to the social area, 18% to research and another 19% to disseminate culture and science In 2018.
UCM
The Complutense University of Madrid is currently the 3rd largest classroom teaching university in Europe. It was founded in 1822. Of the eight Spanish winners of a Nobel Prize, seven studied or were professors at the Complutense University. Among them, the Nobel Prize in Medicine Severo Ochoa and Santiago Ramón y Cajal. The UCM has helped us in this project by letting us use laboratories and facilities in the faculty of biological sciences. Both the Deanship and the Deputy Dean of Biologicals, as well as the vice-rectorships for Innovation and Students, have given their institutional support to the project.
Aplicaciones Técnicas Maquinsa
ATM is the Spanish leader of the manufacturing of high purity systems for pharmaceuticals. With branches on Madrid and Cataluña, its main activity is centered on design, manufacture and introduce aseptic equipment on pharmaceutical production procedures. With an expertise of more than 20 years in the field, ATM continues growing and settling as the Spanish reference on tailor-made sterile systems.
Others Sponsors
IDT
Integrated DNA Technologies was founded in 1987 by Joseph Walder, IDT is one of the biggest worldwide companies that supply custom nucleic acids. IDT is one of the main sponsors of iGEM and we have been purchasing a lot of DNA with the privileges of our team for participating in iGEM.
New England BioLabs
NEB founded in 1974 by Donald Comb, as a cooperative laboratory of experienced scientists, and initially produced restriction enzymes on a commercial scale. Now is a recognized world leader in the discovery and production of enzymes for molecular biology applications. NEB offers one of the largest selection of recombinant and native enzymes for molecular biology research.  Some of the consumables and laboratory materials have been used from NEB.
OLM
It is the non-profit association of biology do-it-yourself founded by the members of the iGEM team: Francisco Gonzalo and Laura. It has allowed financing some of the project materials. It has also allowed meeting more people who participated in other projects related to the association that would later form part of the team.
Ginkgo Bioworks
Founded in 2009 by Tom Knight, Ginkgo Bioworks is a biotechnology company specialized in genetic engineering. Their main focus is the production of bacteria with industrial applications. Biological engineering has come to a reality the last decade and the scaling up the biological process requires a pretty potent software. We have been helped by them in some aspects of our project, especially in the modelling area.
MathWorks
It is one of the most important companies worldwide in data analysis and simulation. The company's most important product, MatLab, was created in the 1970s by Cleve Moler. The company's two lead products are MATLAB, which provides an environment for programmers to analyze and visualize data and develop algorithms, and Simulink, a graphical and simulation environment for the model-based design of dynamic systems. MatLab has been one of the programs used in the simulation of experiments in our project.
Autodesk
Founded in 1982, one of the most known used programs used in the design of a variety of things. Autodesk Life Sciences is one of the brands of the company. It focuses on genetic engineering. When that program, you can visualise DNA code and modify and construct one particular on. That is why we have been using the DNA code modifying software to develop some parts of our project.
