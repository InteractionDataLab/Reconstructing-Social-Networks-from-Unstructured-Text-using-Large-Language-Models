                                    Buenos días hermosos! I'm Fran. One year ago I started this madness with some of the crazy guys in this page. It could not have been more educational and fun.

                                    Personally, I have always found myself learning new things and creating new gizmos. It doesn't matter whether they are based on genetics, electronics or mechanics. With time and curiosity, anyone could learn anything. My particular motivation was always facing new challenges and learning during the process of solving it, giving all my effort into everything I put my mind to. The reward was always watching my petite creations saying &quot;Hello world!&quot;. Participating at iGEM was just an extension of this.
