The first prototype was built such that the LED would shine across a cuvette containing a solution with unknown quantities of protein. The amount of light traversing the solution was quantified by a drop in voltage across the LDR: with higher protein concentrations, higher absorption is expected together with an increased drop in voltage.</P><H4>Analog Signal Processing</H4><P class="lead">The first tests were carried out with an LDR is placed in front of the 280nm UV LED. The drop in voltage was measured by means of an instrumentation amplifier and a low pass filtering circuit (2 Hz cutoff) as shown in the image below. The values of the amplification had to be tuned according to the measurements being recorded.</P><P class="lead">The first tests with known highly-concentrated protein solutions of BSA (13.67mg/mL) and binding buffer yielded the following results:</P><P class="lead">The results above show that the points can be distinguished (the error bars do not overlap) for high concentration changes of 10 orders of magnitude. Purifying that amount of protein with aptamers would be unviable. To test the limit of detection further and with lower concentrations of protein, the 0.1367 mg/mL solution was used for taking readings after diluting it again in the same proportions.</P><P class="lead">The plot above shows that when BSA was diluted to concentrations of 13.67, 1.367 and 0.1367µg/mL or less, changes in luminosity (UV absorption) were indistinguishable (non-significant). Note that the gain has been readjusted with respect to the previous readings.</P><P class="lead">Time dependency was evaluated by taking long recordings under stationary conditions to assess the system response. In an ideal case, the mean value would remain static surrounded by some stochastic errors and interferences. When measurements of around 10 seconds are taken, there is no appreciation in signal decay as seen in longer recordings, but recording of 5 or 10 minutes revealed a time response that had to be accounted for (see figure below).</P><H4>Digital Post-Processing</H4><P class="lead">To try and improve the limit of optical detection without the need of more expensive and higher quality equipment, digital post-processing was built into the microcontroller to try and increase the quality of the signal.</P><P class="lead">We had seen that very short measurements (10 seconds) and also extended measurements (minutes) were subject to higher errors. Short measurements were very sensitive to stochastic and high frequency noise, while longer reading experienced a decay in the signal coming from the hardware (either from the LED or the LDR).</P><P class="lead">The first stage of digital processing, an averaging filter, produced positive results (see figure below). Digital processing with a running average filter smoothens the values obtained and narrows the error bars. Note that the analogue circuit has been adjusted to maximize the amplification within the range of interest but normally the time decay curve would not be as noticeable.</P><H4>Characterizing the system’s time decay response</H4><P class="lead">To characterize time decay, several 5 minute measurements were taken (after switching off the circuit for some time to leave it to rest). The filtered data points measured were very consistent across all measurements showing the same decay behavior. The data points are shown in blue in the plot below together with a fitting curve defined by the equation L(t) in black.</P><P class="lead">With the decay curve characterized from the empirical data obtained, this information can be used to correct this artifact. One way of doing it would be to consider the signal recorded, S<SUB>recorded</SUB>, as the product of the decay curve, <B>L</B>, and the non-attenuated signal, S<SUB>stable</SUB>, and solve by finding the inverse function, L<SUB>-1</SUB>.</P><P class="lead">However, given that inverse functions can have no solution or may cause stability problems (for example, a denominator that goes to zero), the most viable and simple alternative is to express time decay as a summation component instead of a multiplication one.</P><P class="lead">This equation can now be solved to correct for the time decay artifact (see figure below).</P><P class="lead">Since all signals are subject to the same time decay effect, a reference LDR can be used to correct for the effects of this artifact. Each LDR needs to have the same analogue circuit, and the signals are then combined during post-processing. Since measurements do not have to be real-time, post-processing is not a big issue if simple computation algorithms are used.</P><P class="lead">Note that the reference LDR and the signal LDR do not record exactly the same since they do not receive the same amount of light: one is physically placed at a different opening in the chip, in front of a different LED. However, the gains can be adjusted so that both show the same time decay curve. The information from the reference LDR - which remains under stationary conditions - can be used to correct the signal LDR while measurements of protein concentrations are taken.</P><P class="lead">However, even though the magnitude of the variance remains constant, the variance increases with respect to the mean with time. This increase in the coefficient of variation is not good because the relative error increases with time.</P><H4>Testing the device</H4><P class="lead">To test the final device, sequential flow measurements of around 10 seconds were taken in this chip with two LEDs and two LDRs and high concentrations of protein and a pipette. Ideally, these would have been cycled with the syringe pumps, but the control software was not fully ready yet.</P><H4>Conclusions</H4><P class="lead">After analog and digital processing, we were unable to improve the limit of detection beyond the values shown in the initial figures: 13.67µg/mL of BSA and changes of 10 orders of magnitude in the concentration. A better limit of detection of UV absorption would be required to measure airborne allergens captured by aptamers. The quality of our equipment should be improved but at a prohibitive cost, at which point we decided to center our effort to potentiostat detection where the literature suggested finer measurements were achievable with a relative inexpensive devices.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="learned" class="text-center"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 boxed boxed--border bg--secondary boxed--lg box-shadow"><H2>Things we learned while doing</H2><OL class="ourlist"><LI class="nomargin"><P class="lead">The most important lesson we obtained was about the <B>system of measurement</B>.
