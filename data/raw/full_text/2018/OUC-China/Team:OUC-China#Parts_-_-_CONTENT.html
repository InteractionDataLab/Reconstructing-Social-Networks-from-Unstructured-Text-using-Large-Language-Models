As a regulatory element, it can be specifically recognized and cleaved by Csy4 to regulate the expression of its downstream genes on the RNA level. MiniToe is the key of our project, is RFC10  compatible and works as expected. We have documented its experimental characterization on Part's Main Page on the Registry and submitted the sample to the Registry. Certainly, this part is different from the new part documented for Gold#2. See the page for more details:<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2615020"> parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2615020</A>
At the same time, the Csy4 (BBa_K2615003) is one of the key role in our system. We also submitted it to registry. We also apply miniToe to polycistron to create miniToe polycistron (BBa_K2615019).
<H3>Gold parts: Improving an existing part</H3>
Improving an existing Part Standardization and building up on existing parts are the fundaments of iGEM. We have created FOUR new BioBrick Part (BBa_K2615004, BBa_K2615005, BBa_K2615006, BBa_K2615007) that has a functional improvement upon an existing BioBrick Part (BBa_K1062004). The sequences of four new parts and existing part are different, and the new parts are changed by point mutation. We have showed experiments with both parts to demonstrate this improvement. 
See the pages below for details:
