Comic book <I>E.coli SPACESHIP</I> translation</FONT></H4>											

Last year, OUC-China 2017 draw a comic book about synthetic biology. In 2017 Jamboree, a French team thought the comic book was very fantastic and suggested us to translate it into more languages. To popularize synthetic biology in a more interesting way, we put our comic book collaboration request on the website and more than twelve teams contact us and help us translate comic book into other languages. Furthermore, they use our comic book to popularize synthetic biology at the local, hoping to let more people in more countries know the comic book. Under the help of Aix-Marseille, Tartu_TUIT, Duesseldorf, UPF_CRG_Barcelona, Thessaloniki, McMaster, Stockholm, Vilnius-Lithuania, Bilkent-UNAMBG iGEM teams all over the world, now, our comic book has been translated into 13 languages. More than 15 teams take our comic book <I>E.coli SPACESHIP</I> to local areas for science education.

More than 15 teams in China contacted us and requested for different comic book versions to popularize synthetic biology. We were very willing to provide these foreign iGEM teams with our comic books and give some guidance about education. It is a very good job to do science education all over the world, which makes the best use of this comic book. It is worth mentioning that these teams also give us some good feedback about the effects of comic book <I>E.coli SPACESHIP</I>.

Served as a co-organizer, OUC-China tried their best to help the organizers Shanghaitech hold the conference successfully. For the conference preparation, We were responsible for contacting each team, sending a questionnaire to them and investigating the commands of each team for the meeting. Then we organized and summarized all information of 62 teams. At each key time we reminded each team to submit project summary, team logo then sorted according to the track. As an old team, OUC-China actively participated in After iGEM activities and shared our team heritage and experience with other teams.


As a part of the joint iGEM session, OUC-China joined the CCiC Executive Committee and worked with the members of the Executive Committee, organizers, sponsors to plan the conference and contribute to the CCiC heritage.

As as an old team that has been participating in iGEM competition for 8 years, OUC-China is very willing to help SDU-China. At the beginning of the team formation, they came to ocean university of China and asked for help. We explained the process of the iGEM competition to them in detail and remind them some important deadlines. For their project, we gave them some pertinent suggestions. For practice activities, during the summer vacation, we invited them and held a summer camp for high school students in order to popularize life science and synthetic biology. Members of SDU-China explained to the campers how to make insect specimens.

Apart from that, they helped us test the performance of first system, miniToe, proving that our system has the same trend under other experimental conditions. As the figure shows, the orange line refers to the system which is induced while the blue line is the control group, The big difference in expression level between two line indicates that our system is working well as a switch.

Coincidentally, the project of XJTU-China involves polycistron circuit. They use an hairpin coupling device to regulate the ratio of two CDSs which is the same goal to us. Each team thought it was a great idea if we could collaborate with each other on our project. For XJTU-China, it was difficult to model based on their project. We helped them to build model to calculate the coupling efficient of hairpin they designed.<DIV align="center"><P>Fig.1 The coupling device designed by XJTU-China.

This year, SKLMT-China wants to construct a library of artificial constitutive promoters as a useful tool for the model-based fine-tuning of gene expression in Pseudomonas fluorescence. The strength of different promoters will be characterized by a reporter gene, firefly luciferase. To confirm the feasibility of their system in different environments, we helped them test the strength of promoter and gave them a good feedback.
