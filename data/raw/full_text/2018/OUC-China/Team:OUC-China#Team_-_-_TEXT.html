Here we are, we are OUC-China. It has been 8 years since we first took part in iGEM in 2011. This time the team which is made up of 10 members pursues a more particular and creative aim. All the members met in May 2017 when we were unfamiliar with each other and knew nothing about synthetic biology. We struck to intergrate the related disciplines and during this time we became not only teammates but also good friends. We come from different colleges and have diverse specialties which ensure that we join our abilities and insights to make our goal clearer as efficiently as possible.

Hay! I’m QinBo Qiao. My interest in synthetic biology stems from its unlimited potential for improvement. I have held on to the idea of it as my little joy to look forward to. When not iGEM-ing you will see me singing (or trying to), exploring this world by myself and controlling my weight of all time. See you guys in jamboree!
