It has been 8 years since we first took part in iGEM in 2011. This time the team which is made up of 10 members pursues a more particular and creative aim. All the members met in May 2017 when we were unfamiliar with each other and knew nothing about synthetic biology. We struck to intergrate the related disciplines and during this time we became not only teammates but also good friends. We come from different colleges and have diverse specialties which ensure that we join our abilities and insights to make our goal clearer as efficiently as possible.
<DIV align="center" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align:center"><H3>Yunqian Zhang</H3><P>I am a senior in OUC whose major is biotechnology. To my surprise, I attend the iGEM competition in my last year of university. It is am amazing experience with my teammates to explore in the synthetic biology. Not only the lab work but also dry lab make me feel exciting and fresh.  </P><H3>Yanju Chen</H3><P>Hello！I am YanjuChen, major in food science and engineering. It is my pleasure to meet some cute friends in OUC-iGEM team. For me, iGEM provides me a broader platform that helps me learn a lot about synthetic biology. Thank a fortunate encounter. Thank my dear friends. </P><H3>Jiacheng Huang</H3><P>I'm an undergraduate from Institute of Economics who majors in Economics. In life, I love computer and math. In iGEM, I do mathematical modeling to help the project implementation. Hope to see you in jamboree!</P><H3>Xudong Liu</H3><P>I am Xudong Liu，a student in the Department of Biological Sciences. And I like to think about some mysteries of the universe and philosophical issues. I am mainly responsible for the experimental part of the team. </P><H3>Kai Sun</H3><P>Hello, my name is Kai.It's my pleasure to participate in iGEM. I have been interested in biological sciences and mystery novels since I was a child and think the two are very similar.I tried to find the secret of life, hoping to be like Holmes.
</P><H3>Qingjie Li</H3><P>This is Qingjie Li. Glad to participate in this competition! The days I spend in iGEM give me quantities of valuable experience, It’s lucky for me to have this chance to meet my teammates and work with them in this competition.

It's a great pleasure to participate in this competition, to learn more knowledge as well as to meet more interesting people. I think it must  be a very special experience. </P><H3>QinBo Qiao</H3><P>Hay! I’m QinBo Qiao. My interest in synthetic biology stems from its unlimited potential for improvement. I have held on to the idea of it as my little joy to look forward to. When not iGEM-ing you will see me singing (or trying to), exploring this world by myself and controlling my weight of all time. See you guys in jamboree! </P><H3>Hang Jiang</H3><P>My major is ecology, and I prefer the direction of botany. I like painting, traveling, photography, and making handicrafts. It's nice to have the opportunity to join the iGEM team. It's my great pleasure to study with everyone in the group. </P><H3>Luoqin Liu</H3><P>I’m so glad to join the 2018 OUC-China working as a painter, this is my first time take part in an academic international competition, so excited to be here having a communication with all the people around the world. And thanks all my team members who give me so much support and help because I am the youngest one on the team.
