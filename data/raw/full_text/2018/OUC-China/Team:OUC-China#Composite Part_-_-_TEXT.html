BBa_K2615019
Device
MiniToe polycistron B, a new system using miniToe. We insert miniToe into the polycistron and apply the interaction between the miniToe and Csy4 enzyme to achieve the regulation of different ratio of multiple gene expression levels, which can meet the requirements of expression of different genes.

BBa_K2615003
Translational_Unit
Made up of Csy4-WT and RBS, it can recognize and cleave a 22nt hairpin. As an important part in our project, Csy4 can work with miniToe and some miniToe mutants to regulate the expression of downstream genes on the level of RNA.

BBa_K2615004
Translational_Unit
Made up of Csy4-Q104A and RBS, it can recognize and cleave a 22nt hairpin. As an important part in our project, Csy4-Q104A can work with miniToe and some miniToe mutants to regulate the expression of downstream genes on the level of RNA. And this part design by point mutation, we change the CAG(encoding Gln) to GCG(encoding Ala) on the 104th site based on Csy4-WT.

BBa_K2615008
Device
This part is the miniToe family test system No.1, which consists of promoter J23119, miniToe-1 and sfGFP. We use miniToe to regulate the downstream gene, so sfGFP is a symbol of target gene in this part. The intensity of upstream regulatory element can be characterized by fluorescence.
