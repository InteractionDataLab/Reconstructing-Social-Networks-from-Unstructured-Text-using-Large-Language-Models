to further explore various societal applications of computer science.    </P><H3>Kevin Li</H3><P>
Kevin Li is a rising sophomore at Yale majoring in Molecular, Cellular
and Developmental Biology. Originally from sunny Orlando, Florida,
Kevin spent this past winter realizing how cold it can get in the
Northeast and how much it can snow in one city. Climate aside, Kevin
also realized his passion for biology at Yale and is interested in
exploring the potential of small organisms. Outside of participating in
research with the iGEM Team, he enjoys singing with his a cappella
group, and working closely with a local Alderman in the New Haven
community.    </P><H3>Ricky Moscoso</H3><P>

also caught her eye. Being both an artist and a biologist, Alice is
invested in the future of medical illustration and scientific literacy,
which she believes will soon be transformed by new forms of visual
storytelling and technology.  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
