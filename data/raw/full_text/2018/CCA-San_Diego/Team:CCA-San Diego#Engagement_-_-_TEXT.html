CCA-San_Diego iGEM Video Series
We created a video series that can be useful for any iGEM team. Whether you just started an iGEM team or you're a team with more experience, these videos can help you learn more about our iGEM team dynamics here at CCA San Diego, how your team can get involved with the community, or how we publicize our outreach events. The purpose is to articulate various facets of our iGEM team this year in an interesting and engaging manner. We also made these videos in order to clarify questions individuals in the public and iGEM judges may have on our iGEM team, discussing how to publicize, what our team feels we learned from our iGEM this year, what various roles in iGEM entail, what iGEM is, a day in our lab, and how we've facilitated Inegrated Human Practices in our iGEM team this year. Furthermore, we were able to collaborate with a local team, the Torrey Pines High School team, and they created a video to help us in our series for lab safety.
