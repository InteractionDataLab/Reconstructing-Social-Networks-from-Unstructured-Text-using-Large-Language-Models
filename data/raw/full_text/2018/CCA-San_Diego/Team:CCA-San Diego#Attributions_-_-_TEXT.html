Canyon Crest Academy is a public high school in sunny San Diego, California with a student body of about 3000. We are fortunate enough to have many STEM courses at our school, including AP science classes and even research-immersive classes.
QUEST Lab- our research is conducted in the QUEST research lab that is used primarily for a project-based course. Using the accumulation of donated supplies from local universities and years of other students we were able to conduct our experiments. There is a limited range of resources though therefore.
