Team Members
Yiqi Wu
I'm Eulrika Wu, the leader of SHPH team. I introduced iGEM into our school and built up the team from scratch. My major role is to communicate with teachers, labs and team members to ensure every thing we do is on the right track.
Zidi Mu
I’m Zidi Mu and I am one of the leaders of SHPH-Shanghai. I have an interest in life sciences and appreciate the opportunity to design and conduct scientific experiments in high school. iGEM provides me with excellent practical experience in synthetic biology and biotechnologies as I spent days in a hospital laboratory amending and redoing experiments. The experience of leading a team also teaches me to schedule work in advance in order to be fully prepared.
Chuyue Zhang
I'm Victoria, a 11th grader in Shanghai Pinghe school. I’m interested in things related to nature and biology. This summer, I did the Interlab part of our project as well as some experiments in our laboratory.  I learnt a lot during this process and began to find the joy in it. I will also take part in our presentation and some of our powerpoint. I’m looking forward to sharing our result and meeting some brilliant ideas on our trip to Boston(& I hope to still have hair after the junior year)!
Yuxin Zhou
My name is Yuxin Zhou and I am a member of SHPH-Shanghai. Although I am very interested in life sciences, I am not an expert in this field. However, I am really good at communication and have a good command of the ability to promote. As a result, I will be responsible for fully presenting our project. I entered the lab for the first time in my life during the iGEM competition and it had been a fun experience for me. I learned a lot about how to cooperate with my teammates and gained a lot of biological knowledge. It is a truly meaningful experience for me.
Yihua Wang
I’m Yihua(Evon) Wang from Shanghai Pinghe School, and my main role in this team is to write the research paper after the experiments are finished. Since I would like to pursue biomedical science in the future, iGem provided me the valuable opportunity to learn about synthetic biology and bioengineering. I’ve also done other researches on Chinese Traditional Medicine, but apart from natural science, I love ballet, figures skating and writing, and that’s the reason why I’m taking charge of this written assignment in this team.
Yi'an Qian
Hi, this is Yian! I am mainly responsible for essay writing and poster design.  This great team arouses my interest in synthetic biology and promotes me to think about the unlimited possibilities this discipline could give the world. The charm of biology and engineering has fascinated me for a long time and I am always finding a way to combine them. I believe iGem can be a good start!
Chenan Huang
I am a senior student in Shanghai pinghe school, and I participated in wiki design and experiments. iGem is definitely a great experience for me, as I could gather more knowledge on synthetic biology. Apart from my great interests in Botanical science, I am also a dancer and a bassist, which made me one of the artsiest members in the group(this is why I’m in charge of all graphic components in the competition[with Luke]).
Tianze Hua
I am Tianze Hua from Shanghai Pinghe school. I am interested in synthetic biology because of its unlimited possibilities. As a team member, I helped design the experiments as well as did most of them.
Yimo Zhang
I am Jack from Shanghai Pinghe Bilingual School. As a senior taking biology high level, my passion for biology motivates me to step further into researches. With deep interests into neuroscience, I believe genetic modification will provides us with more insights into the function and mechanisms of ourselves, and consequently how to change them. I'm also in charge of the major part of human practice as I'm certain that a successful project, no matter how insignificant it is, it has to address some hinein needs for it to be successful.
Yue Xiao
Hi! I’m Sean from SHPH-Shanghai Team 2018. I do a large portion of the experiments for the team together with other two team members in summer. At first I barely knew anything about how to do experiments. However, I learned about so much through out the process of experiment from the other two member and, thanks to them, I was able to do the experiment all by myself at last.
Yifan Gu
I am Michael and interested in conducting biological experiments. Had I not the vocation to take the SAT, I would have stayed in the laboratory for a whole summer... But I still learned many practical skills and experimental knowledge, which I can’t wait to share with all you in Boston.
Ronghao Zhang
My name is Luke. I, a G-12 student in Shanghai Pinghe Bilingual School, participated in iGEM team SHPH-Shanghai as a designer of the website with Anne. iGEM provided a fantastic opportunity for me to collaborate with other students as well as understand biological processes and biotechnologies. Not only do I have great interests on microbiology and organisms, but also I love sketching and classical Chinese music, which enables me to annotate biology terms in a new perspective by combing classical arts.
Xuanyi Piao
This is PIAO Xuanyi, a senior of Pinghe School. Even though I failed to take part in the main experiment which interests me more for schedule issues, the task of building website with a partner still provided me with lots of fun. I'm also asked to compose a theme song for the program, which is something that I'm glad to do for the team with all of my enthusiasm.
Jiqing Fan
I am a senior from Shanghai Pinghe School. I don’t take biology but I am really interested in it. I am also interested in electrical engineering. I help to make website in our team. My workmate is a nice person, so I enjoy work with him, and we might be the happiest partner in our team. I am glad to be in the team.
Liangwen Xu
Liangwen Xu, IB biology and ESS teacher in Shanghai Pinghe school, majoring in animal physiology and evolution studies. Prior to my teaching, worked for the local government on marine ecosystem research, specifically on mangroves restoration.
Wenjuan Wu
Field of research：Clinical microbiology and hospital infection control Professor Wu is our primary PI, she is Director of Department of Laboratory Medicine of Shanghai East Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University. She has extensive experience in clinical microbiology, molecular biology, and nosocomial infection control. She is interested in the study of the relationship between Candida albicans biofilm with virulence, drug resistance and treatment. Professor Wu was responsible for team training, project guidance, and supervision. E-mail: wwj1210@126.com
Xiaoyu Yu
