COLLABERATIONS
Team ECUST
As high school students, we were not so familiar with the competition and the techniques it requires. Thus the mentoring from Team ECUST contributed a lot towards our understanding of the whole process and necessary steps. Moreover, ECUST offered us instructions and experimental equipment for the interlab session, which is essential for medals.
In return, we joined the 3+ net initiative they started. 3+ net is a collaboration&human practise project for putting forward guidelines for better understanding of our situation and projects. Our major role is to help with the Society+ part which call for collected opinions from different groups. With the mutual focus of environment pollution, we constructed a survey about public opinions towards bioengineering approach of solving pollution. Within a week, we were able to receive more than 500 questionnaires filled out from all age groups. By helping with surveys making and data analyze, our mutual bonds for advocating the potential of bioengineering is solidified.
Meet up with SHSID_China and SUIS-Shanghai
On July 21st, 2018, we brought together two other teams, SHSID_China and SUIS-Shanghai to discuss our project progression. Within an afternoon, we exchanged ideas about our projects and share mutual difficulties for possible solution. With questions and suggestions, we were able to identify each othersâ€™ strengths and flaws, seeking improvements. Future collaboration plans were also raised.
Mock presentation with SHSU_China and SHSID_China
On October 14th, 2018, our team met up with SHSU_China and SHSID_China at Fudan University for mock presentations as preparations for the final delivery at the Giant Jamboree. Feedback from each teams is exchanged and we gained more insights into possible impurities of our project. More experiences about human practise, wiki building and modelling are also shared in order to help each other seeking more improvements.
