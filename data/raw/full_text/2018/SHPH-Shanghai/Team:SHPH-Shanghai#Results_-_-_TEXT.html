Result and analysis
(1) Result of the Pre-experiment
In each plate, from left to right, the pH value for each hole is respectively 1,3,5,7.
(2) Analysis of the Pre-experiment
From both the photography of the 96-microwell plate and the value of OD in each hole, we can observe a significant relevance between the level of biofilm degradation and acidic culturing environment. In the graph, biofilms under condition of pH=1 and pH=3 were very thin and hard to observe, which is consistent with the OD value. On the other hand, biofilms under the condition of pH=5 and 7, the degradation hardly took place.
From the perspective of designing the investigating subject, biologically modifying the biofilm living condition to pH=3 would be a proper and achievable aim. For pH=1, it is too hard for any genetically modified bacteria to achieve; and the effect of pH=1 and pH=3 are similar with regard to the degradation level of the biofilm.
Gene Extraction
Bacterial gene extraction: we use the standard protocol included in the extraction kit. Tissue gene extraction: we used the standard protocol included in the extraction kit.
