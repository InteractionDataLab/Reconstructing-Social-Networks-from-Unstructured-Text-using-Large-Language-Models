We hoped to understand the dynamic characteristics of the blue light repressible promoter (P<SUB>BLrep</SUB>) better as it has a pivotal role in our project. The existing part has a bioreporter, the coding region of the bioreporter, LuxCDABE. However, the large gene cluster (&gt;5500bp) makes it difficult to carry out dynamic characterization due to its complexity. Furthermore, no characterisation data is available on iGEM17_UCL’s part registry page for the blue light repressible promoter <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2332019">BBa_K2332019</A>.</P><P>Therefore, our team sought to conduct a study on P<SUB>BLrep</SUB> by using a more suitable reporter. We altered the sequence of this composite part by replacing the LuxCDABE coding region with a commonly used reporter gene, the red fluorescent protein (RFP, ~700bp), as well as attaching different degradation tags to the reporter gene to study the characteristics of this promoter. Furthermore, this new part will have wider applications compared to the previous part, such as by serving as an indicator. As the overall plasmid size is reduced significantly, it is now easier for users to co-transform it with other constructs. </P><H2><CENTER>Our new part: Blue Light Activated Repressible Promoter with RFP Reporter attached to YbaQ Degradation Tag</CENTER></H2><P>This part contains a promoter that can be repressed by blue light (450 nm). The promoter makes use of a blue light dependent DNA-binding protein, EL222. Irradiation by blue light exposes the hitherto sequestered HTH, facilitating dimerization of EL222 and subsequent DNA binding. Repression is achieved by placing the DNA binding site of EL222 between the -35 and -10 hexamers of the consensus promoter in <I>E. coli</I>, creating the blue light repressible promoter P<SUB>BLrep</SUB> As a result, EL222 acts as a repressor, blocking the binding of RNA polymerase and repressing gene expression in the presence of blue light. In the dark, monomeric EL222 is unable to attach to its binding site, and RNA polymerase can now bind to drive gene expression (Figure 1).

However, we quickly found that the expression of RFP cannot be regulated by this promoter, as its expression profile did not follow induction patterns. Therefore, we altered the sequence of the coding region to obtain a degradation rate optimal for this promoter to work. This improve its functionality as users can now a have better knowledge on how to use this promoter. To achieve this, we attached different degradation tags to RFP, and performed characterizations using various blue light on-off patterns. P<SUB>BLrep</SUB> can be regarded as a constitutive promoter when blue light is absent, i.e. in the dark, as dimerization of EL222 will not take place.</P><BUTTON class="accordion">Methods</BUTTON><DIV class="panel"><DIV class="panel-inside"><P>All plasmids confer kanamycin resistance, and all constructions and characterizations were done in <I>E. coli</I> TOP10.  Three composite parts were used: P<SUB>BLrep</SUB>-RFP (original part), P<SUB>BLrep</SUB>-RFP-DAS and P<SUB>BLrep</SUB>-RFP-YbaQ. All three were tested simultaneously in each experiment. Engineered cells were inoculated in 5 mL of LB with kanamycin overnight. The next day, 5 uL of cell culture was refreshed in 5 mL of fresh LB with kanamycin until OD<SUB>600</SUB> reaches 0.05, upon which 1 ml of cell culture was transferred to each well of a 12-well plate.

Change in RFP/OD over 8 hours in the dark (a) and under blue light (b).</B></FIGCAPTION><P>
Our data suggests that using RFP solely as a reporter is unable to reflect the expected induction and repression activities of the promoter. As seen from Figures 3a and b, fluorescence decreased over the period of 0 to 4 hours in the dark, and increased over the period of 4 to 8 hours under blue light. This is completely opposite of what we expected. We speculated that this phenomenon is due to the mismatch in the rate of increase in OD<SUB>600</SUB> and the degradation rate of RFP. Hence, to alter the degradation rate of RFP, we attached 2 different degradation tags to it, YbaQ and DAS. Degradation tags are also referred to as degrons. They are either part of coding regions, or are added to them to direct their degradation by proteases. 
</P><P>Experimental results show that <EM>RFP attached to YbaQ</EM> could reflect the expected induction and repression activities of P<SUB>BLrep</SUB>. As shown in Figure 3a, RFP/OD increased steadily with time in the dark, where repression is absent, while in Figure 3b, we can see that RFP/OD decreased exponentially with time under blue light. The high intial RFP/OD at 0 hour in Figure 3a can be explained by the low initial OD<SUB>600</SUB> (0.05) and the presence of RFP in the system prior to the commencement of the experiment.

Figures 4a and b represent the comparison of RFP/OD of persistent light on and off conditions for P<SUB>BLrep</SUB>-RFP and P<SUB>BLrep</SUB>-RFP-YbaQ. There is a clear increasing trend for the fold change for P<SUB>BLrep</SUB>-RFP-YbaQ, while the fold change for P<SUB>BLrep</SUB>-RFP increased over the period of 0 to 4 hours, then dropped for the subsequent 4 hours.
</P><P>This characterisation experiment tells us that the degradation rate of RFP-YbaQ is required for this promoter to work as intended.

To verify that the degradation rate of RFP-YbaQ is indeed the most optimal for P<SUB>BLrep</SUB> to work, we carried out further characterisation experiments with different blue light on-off patterns.
</P><FIGURE class="figures2" style="max-width: 100%;"><FIGCAPTION style="text-align:justify;font-size: 15px"><B>Figure 5. 2 hours in the Dark, 4 hours with Blue Light On.     Figure 6. 3 hours in the Dark, 3 hours with Blue Light On.</B></FIGCAPTION><P>
As observed from the Figures 5 and 6, even under different light on-off patterns, P<SUB>BLrep</SUB>-RFP-YbaQ still performed the best, showing clearer oscillation patterns with the absence and presence of light, while P<SUB>BLrep</SUB> with just RFP alone or with RFP-DAS showed relatively poor responses with the rate at which light is being switched on and off.

We also modelled the activity of the promoter and our model shows that for P<SUB>BLrep</SUB> to reflect better oscillation patterns, we should incubate the cell cultures in the dark for 45 minutes, and under blue light for the remaining duration of the experiment. 
</P><FIGURE class="figures2" style="max-width: 60%;"><FIGCAPTION style="text-align:justify"><B>Figure 7. 45 minutes in the Dark and 7 hours with Blue Light On.</B></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>
Our wetlab experimental data verified the recommendations made by our model. A dip is no longer observed at the start of the graph, and the change in RFP/OD could reflect our light on-off pattern.
</P></DIV></DIV><H2>Conclusion</H2><P>
Our improvement of changing the coding region sequence of a common reporter gene, RFP, by adding a degradation tag, YbaQ, has allowed us to better understand how we can use this the blue light repressible promoter P<SUB>BLrep</SUB>. Based on our characterization results, we recommend future users to use a coding region with similar degradation rates as RFP-YbaQ in order to achieve the desired function of this promoter. <B>This new part has hence improved the functionality of this promoter, which has helped us to be more mindful when we select genes to be placed under the control of this promoter in our project.</B></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="footer_wrapper"><DIV class="big_black_thing "><DIV class="left_side"><H3 style="color:white;"><B>  HEAR OUR STORY </B></H3><P>We’re using synthetic biology to change the way the world thinks and functions.</P><P>We’re a little disruptive, dangerous and maybe a tad too bold.
