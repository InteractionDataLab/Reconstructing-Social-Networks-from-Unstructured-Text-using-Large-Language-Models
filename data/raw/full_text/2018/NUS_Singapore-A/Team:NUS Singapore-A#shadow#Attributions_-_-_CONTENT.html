</P></DIV></DIV><BUTTON class="accordion">PART 4: HARDWARE</BUTTON><DIV class="panel" style="background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.6);"><DIV class="panel-inside"><P><B>Miss TAN Annie</B> and <B>Mr. YIP Chi Ho, Justin</B> helped us with the procurement of equipment for assembly of our hardware, for example helping us purchase bearings for use in our peristaltic pump. They also helped process our Item Request Lists so our purchases could be reimbursed. 
While we did not actualize the ideas generated by <B>Mr. Brian Shohei TEO</B> during our discussion on how to refine the design of Light Wait, we still learned much about good design practice and unconventional thinking, and did our best to practice these principles in later designs. 
He reviewed our Hardware page, along with <B>Mr. Eugene EE</B>. 
<B>Mr. Anuwar bin SHUKOR</B> and <B>Mr. TAY Peng Yeow</B> supervised us and ensured our safety in our use of the 3D printer and laser cutter. 
When it was not possible to use the school’s facilities, <B>Mr SAJJAD Ali</B> helped us 3D print our designs using his personal 3D printer.
</P></DIV></DIV><BUTTON class="accordion">PART 5: MODELLING</BUTTON><DIV class="panel" style="background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.6);"><DIV class="panel-inside"><P>
We would like to thank <B>Dr. YEOH Jing Wui</B> for imparting to us the principles of mathematical modelling which helped us analyse the relevant biochemical pathways, introducing to us the concepts of optimisation, 
and perhaps most importantly, being approachable and allowing our team to consult her throughout the course of our project. She gave us useful and practicable advice 
- for example, when we were not able to get good fits based on our model, she told us to take into consideration the time for RFP maturation.
</P><P>
We would also like to thank <B>Dr. Maurice LING</B> from AdvanceSyn, who helped us perform sensitivity analysis using the AdvanceSyn Toolkit, a suite of open-sourced tools for model development and model analysis; 
with an emphasis on systems biology, synthetic biology, and metabolic engineering.
</P></DIV></DIV><BUTTON class="accordion">PART 6: COLLABORATIONS</BUTTON><DIV class="panel" style="background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.6);"><DIV class="panel-inside"><P>
Collaborations have undeniably opened up more possibilities for our project. 
This year, we are very grateful to build meaningful collaborations with 4 teams:

<A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:ULaval">Team ULaval 2018</A>.
</P><P>
At the start, our team wanted to work with aptamers. Unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful in our constructions. 
The wet-lab team from CUHK helped us to redesign our constructs involving aptamers, 
as well as the primers for these constructions, which led to eventual successful constructions. 
</P><P>
We would like to sincerely thank Team NTU for helping us to characterise our new biobrick parts: 
<A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2819000">BBa_K2819000</A> and 
<A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2819206">BBa_K2819206</A>. 
Their expertise in real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was extremely useful in helping our team generate quality characterisation data for our biobrick systems.
</P><P>
Team Toulouse and Team ULaval helped us develop a comprehensive coverage in our education and engagement activities. 
The three teams worked closely together to produce a handy and engaging booklet which comprehensively summarises the pertinent issues surrounding synthetic biology 
- Team Toulouse authored a section on ethical concerns in synthetic biology, Team ULaval authored another section on the cultural and social aspects of synthetic biology.

Our hardware fabrication would not be possible had it not been for the generous support of the
Engineering Design and Innovation Centre’s Electronics Workshop, the Engineering Fabrication
Laboratory, and the MedTech Product Realisation Studio. Thank you for allowing us free use of
the fabrication and electronics equipment such as the 3D printers, laser cutter, and soldering
irons.
</P><P>
Mr. MUHAMMED Abdurrahiem bin Abdul lent us 10 Arduino Unos so that we could commence
our work immediately, instead of simply waiting idly for our own orders to arrive.
Miss TAN Annie gave us food for body and soul, while Mr. YIP Chi Ho, Justin supplied us with
his personal brand of sardonic humour and acrylic glue in equal measure. Additionally, we
inherited a set of legendary ball bearings from Mr. Brian Shohei TEO, These 4 ancient (much like
their original owner) bearings were salvaged from the flying machine he created as part of his
undergraduate dissertation, the Phoenix. Both this set of ball bearings and his oft macabre,
perpetually facetious jokes helped motivate our hardware team greatly. But most importantly,
all of these people were kind.
</P><P>
Mr. SAJJAD Ali introduced us to Russian culture, provided intellectual stimulation, and also lent
us acrylic glue. If you’re noticing a theme here, it’s because our life was in pieces and
unfortunately we needed acrylic glue in industrial quantities. Not to drink and thus end our
misery, but to make our cuvettes watertight. This was accomplished once Mr Jonathan
AMBROSE lent us his Acrifix cement, for which we are eternally grateful. The hardware team has
no comment on whether we still need to pull ourselves together.
