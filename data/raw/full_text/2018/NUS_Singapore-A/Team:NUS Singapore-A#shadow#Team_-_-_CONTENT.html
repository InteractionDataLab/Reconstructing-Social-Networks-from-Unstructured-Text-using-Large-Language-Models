She’s one ambitious lady; she hopes to pick up as many skills as possible and be a Jack of all trades and Master of some. She envisions her future self as someone who would not only make significant contributions to the society, but also empower others, especially the underprivileged, to pursue their dreams. Aside from these, she has also been secretly wishing to have a celestial star named after her in future.</P><H2>INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HER</H2><P style="font-family: 'lora';">Usually people can't tell which country is she from because of her rather unique name - it's not very Singaporean but she's born and bred in Singapore! Perhaps because of her multilingual name, she is skilled at doing English-Chinese translation, and would probably make a career of it if she can’t find employment related to her main degree.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="profile-content"><DIV class="profile"><DIV class="profile-description"><DIV class="namecard"><H1>NUR LIYANA BINTE AYUB OW YONG</H1><P>Life Sciences</P></DIV><H2 style="">ROLE</H2><P style="font-family: 'lora';">

          regret that I announce the premature demise of the editorial gerbils, Pinky and The Brian. Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit was too much to handle. This intellectual deficiency will be rectified in the next generation of editorial gerbils.)

        </P><H2>AMBITION</H2><P style="font-family: 'lora';"> Russell strongly believes in change, and thinks that synthetic biology is one of the keys to change, which is why he’s taking part in iGEM.

</P><H2>INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HIM</H2><P style="font-family: 'lora';">He tried to join the previous year’s iGEM team, but was unsuccessful due to unfortunate circumstances beyond his control. However, this year he’s finally here, and raring to go! If anything else, it speaks to his tremendous passion for synthetic biology and demonstrates his sheer tenacity. Russell also enjoys taking naps at lunchtime, and feels very much at home in IKEA, especially during lunchtime. His favourite pop artiste is Norlie &amp; KKV.

        </P><H2>AMBITION</H2><P style="font-family: 'lora';"> Hao Yuan aspires to do something good using (surprise, surprise) synthetic biology. Other less lofty life goals include re-learning how to play the piano, watching his beloved football team in the flesh, and learning Japanese so he can finally watch anime without subtitles.

</P><H2>INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HIM</H2><P style="font-family: 'lora';">Besides being a science buff, he’s also physically buff! He plays tennis using tables rather than rackets. (Editor’s Note: The editorial gerbils report that something may have been lost in transcription. The editor thus warns that the accuracy of Hao Yuan’s interesting fact may have been compromised, an understandable result of salvaging the remains of Hao Yuan’s files from gerbil excrement.)
