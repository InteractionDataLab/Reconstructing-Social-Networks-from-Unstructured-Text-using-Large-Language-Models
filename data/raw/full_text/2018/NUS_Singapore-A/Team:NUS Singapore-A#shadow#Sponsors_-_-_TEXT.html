NUS Engineering was established in the National University of Singapore (NUS) with the merger in 1980 between the University of Singapore and Nanyang University. The largest of fourteen faculties and schools at NUS, the Faculty has grown from 300 students in the late 1970s to close to 10,000 strong today. Today, we are a vibrant community with ten departments and programmes, and is among the top 10 in the world for engineering and technology.
NUS Engineering’s mission is to nurture Engineer-Leaders with a global perspective and to lead in technology through high-impact research. Celebrating its 60th Anniversary in 2015, the Faculty has contributed substantially to the rapid industrial and economic growth of the nation while continuing to contribute to a knowledge-based economy.
With an increasing international student and staff population, the Faculty has developed into a truly cosmopolitan environment for tertiary education, emphasising both fundamentals and applications.
NUS Synthetic Biology for Clinical and Technological Innovation (SynCTI) was formally established in Jan 2015 as the focal research program for synthetic biology at the National University of Singapore. SynCTI operates as a highly interdisciplinary research core that amalgamates leading Principal Investigators from Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Engineering. SynCTI aims to anchor Singapore as one of the leading Synthetic Biology Hubs in the world and to develop novel biological and biologically-based systems with advanced clinical and industrial applications. Through research collaborations with renowned international institutes and private industries, SynCTI strives to create new knowledge and develop foundational technologies in synthetic biology and groom future generations of highly skilled researchers endowed with basic science and translational research capabilities.

Having worked alongside and added value to laboratory research for over 40 years, we are a truly integrated and respected member of the genetics research community.
Our tag line ‘a responsibility to science’, acts as a continual reminder for us to do our utmost to support, develop new technology, and add as much value as possible to the science and the scientific community we serve.
The BioMakerSpace at Faculty of Engineering (FOE) was set up recently in April 2018. The BioMakerSpace@FOE is a lab space for students to get hands-on experience on engineering of biology and turn their ideas into prototypes by taking the “maker culture” approach. The space is well equipped with state-of-the art equipment to facilitate the engineering of microbes using synthetic biology. It is also a place to prompt innovation and entrepreneurship in the field of Engineering Biology. The space is currently the basecamp for NUS iGEM teams.

HEAR OUR STORY
We’re using synthetic biology to change the way the world thinks and functions.
We’re a little disruptive, dangerous and maybe a tad too bold. But the world needs some shaking up every now and then, and we think we’re just the right people for that.
Together we’re going to engineer biology and create something awesome.
