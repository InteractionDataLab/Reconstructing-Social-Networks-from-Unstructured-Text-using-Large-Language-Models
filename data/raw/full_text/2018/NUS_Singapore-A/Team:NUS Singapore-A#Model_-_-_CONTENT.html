Modelling has supported the project since its nascent stages, and had thus investigated the biosynthesis of chrysanthemin besides luteolin. In fact, the choice to focus on luteolin can be largely attributed to recommendations gathered from both expert interviews (see: <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:NUS_Singapore-A/Human_Practices"><I>Integrated Human Practices</I></A>) and insights gained from modelling.</P><BUTTON class="accordion">PART 1: PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF FLAVONOID PRODUCTION IN-SILICO </BUTTON><DIV class="panel" style="background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.6);"><DIV class="panel-inside"><H2>Goal</H2><P>
In order to choose a suitable molecular product, the Wet Lab team must understand the feasibility of producing various compounds in <I>E. coli</I> from a starting substrate.
In this study, we looked at the production of two candidate flavonoid molecules (chrysanthemein and luteolin) using naringenin as a starting point.
These molecules were chosen for their colour as mentioned in the overview and because the necessary enzymes have been cloned before in <I>E. coli</I>.
By building a mathematical model of the pathway, we simulated the conversion of naringenin into the candidate products and chose the best candidate for the project.
In addition, we explored how enzyme concentrations affect our system to provide insight into designing the genetic circuit.
</P><P><I><B>Considerations</B></I></P><P>
Given the limited time and resources, we consider the best candidate to be the one that has the highest yield.
We also noted the existence of a secondary pathway leading to callistephin (an undesired product) in producing chrysanthemein.
Our model thus had to take the callistephin pathway into account as well.
</P><FIGURE class="figures"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 1.</B> Biochemical Pathway from starting substrate Naringenin </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H2>Methods</H2><P><B>Modelling Product Yield</B></P><P>
Among our criteria, understanding the yield was not something that could be done just by looking at the pathway or literature.
Thus, it was necessary for us to simulate the conversion of naringenin by building a mathematical model of enzyme activity.
The model consisted of a system of differential equations which was then solved with respect to time using MATLAB.

The results prove that production of flavonoids was theoretically feasible in <I>E. coli</I>, allowing for decent yield of Chrysanthemin and Luteolin.
Assuming the starting amount of Naringenin substrate to be 20000nM, 100% conversion of luteolin is achieved in 5.3 hours.
Meanwhile, only ~11410nM of chrysanthemin is produced in 8 hours and ~2000nM of callistephin is present in the product.
Thus, luteolin will have the better yield.
</P><P> Without careful flux control, only luteolin can be produced in satisfactory yields.
Hence luteolin was chosen as the product of choice. <B>Focusing on the production of Luteolin</B> was thus the best way forward as flux control to obtain a pure Chrysanthemin product was too difficult and unfeasible due to time frame limitations.
Control of the enzyme concentrations is necessary to improve yield and give optogenetic control. Subsequent experiments hence focus on improving yield and control as well as the implications on genetic circuit design. In future experiments, the Wet Lab team was also given recommendations to consider tightly controlling enzyme concentrations in order to achieve higher yield, which would influence future plasmid designs. Hence, optimisation of our genetic circuit would improve our Naringenin conversion rates.</P></DIV><BUTTON class="accordion-closer">CLOSE</BUTTON></DIV><BUTTON class="accordion">PART 2: LUTEOLIN OUTPUT OPTIMISATION </BUTTON><DIV class="panel"><DIV class="panel-inside"><H2>Goal</H2><P>
The genetic circuit should be an important design consideration;
parts like the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) affect the translation rates and thus, enzyme concentration, which ultimately affects yield and conversion rates.
Two RBS parts are available: rbsD and rbs34.
Unfortuantely, it is not possible to conjugate two of the same RBS parts on the same plasmid and a choice must be made on which RBS controls which enzyme.
We thus investigated the difference in strength between the two parts as well as their effect on yield.
The conclusion was to pair rbsD with F3'H and rbs34 with FNS.
</P><H2>Methods</H2><P><B>Comparison of RBS strength</B></P><P>
In the first part of this study, we used experimental characterisation <A href="#C4">data</A> from a Synthetic Biology lab at E6 Engineering (NUS) to compare relative strengths of rbs34 and rbsD by their ability to produce RFP. 
The final expression concentrations of varying inducer concentrations (of 0.002g/100ml, 0.008g/100ml, 0.031g/100ml and 0.125g/100ml) were compared between the two RBS systems 
and the average was taken for all inducer concentrations to obtain the relative strengths of the RBS systems.
We then determined that rbsD was twice as strong as rbs 34.
This is shown below:

By comparison, it is observed that 100% naringenin conversion occurs at the 2.4 hour mark for the rbs34/FNS and rbsD/F3’H system while 100% conversion for the rbsD/FNS and rbs34/F3’H system occurs at 4.7 hours. 
It can also be observed from Figure 4 that 100% conversion occurs faster in the rbsD/F3’H construct.

We have identified the following sources of error and weaknesses in our model:
</P><P><I><B>Conditions were assumed to be similar to that in the characterization experiments.</B></I></P><P>
Enzyme expression and activity depend on the conditions such as temperature.
It is possible that the conditions in a bioreactor will be such that the difference between the RBS will be smaller or larger depending on the bioreactor environment.

The stability of the intermediates are unclear but they are certainly oxidizable.
Similarly, luteolin can also be degraded by oxidative reactions<SUP>1</SUP>.
Thus, future models can look into how yield changes with stability of the compounds.

For the control and DAS, we found that our model was able to capture the trends in RFP concentration over time for scenario 5 quite well but less so for scenario 4. 
The fit for YbaQ was unfortunately poorer.
We hypothesize that more factors were present that were not accounted for and that they probably play a much smaller role when the light is on or off all the way but become important for &quot;intermediate&quot; scenarios.
In any case, it appears that the performance of the system can be predicted with reasonable accuracy for lighting regimes close to the scenario 1 and 3.
Also, a degradation tag that is too strong may also result in larger deviation.
Meanwhile, more complex regimes will require a better model.
</P><H3>Inducible System Modelling</H3><P>
Our team proceeded to investigate the usefulness of our model for an blue light inducible system.

Compared to the repressible system, the fit was not as good. 
In particular, the model could not capture the drop in RFP concentration that appeared at the start of the experiment in many cases.
In other cases, the model was unable to capture the increase in RFP concentration correctly.
Unfortuantely, even when degmRFP, synRFP, degRFP were allowed to vary, we were still unable to improve the fit significantly.
</P><H2>Weaknesses and Future Improvement</H2><P>
We have identified the following sources of error and weaknesses in our model:
</P><P><I><B>All RFP matures before degradation</B></I></P><P>
Given the long maturation time for RFP, it is likely that degradation of nascent RFP could have played a significant role.
</P><P><I><B>Initial mRNA concentration was assumed to be 0</B></I></P><P>
This is unlikely to be true given the presence of RFP even at the start of the experiment.
Future work measuring mRNA concentration will greatly reduce unvertainty during modelling.
</P><P><I><B>Initial concentration of nascent RFP was assumed to be 0</B></I></P><P>
This assumption is valid only if RFP matures quickly enough for the nascent form to undectable.
However, our model indicated a long maturation time which implies that nascent RFP could have been present in siginificant amounts at the start.
</P><P><I><B>All nascent RFP was assumed to be converted into mature RFP without degradation.</B></I></P><P>
It is likely that whatever mechanisms causing degradation of mature of RFP can act on nascent RFP too even if not as efficiently.
Furthermore, the long maturation time of RFP means it is possible that degradation of nascent RFP may be significant.
</P><P><I><B>Assumed no reversal in the effect of EL222 concentration on the inducible promoter.</B></I></P><P>
High EL222 concentration can have an inhibitory effect on the inducible promoter.
The wet lab team can use a weaker promoter in the future to avoid EL222 reaching inhibitory concentrations.
</P><P><I><B>Changing conditions of media during the experiment</B></I></P><P>
Over the course of the experiment, nutrients are depleted from the media while metabolic waste is produced and accumulates in it.
Such inconsistencies in growing conditions can affect the performance of the system.
The wet-lab team attempted to minimize such effects by keeping the experiment under 8 hours.
Future work starting with a lower OD, using a continuous setup or a cell-free environment can help us study the system in isolation.
</P><H2>Achieving on-off Cycles</H2><P>
We found that the slow maturation of the nascent RFP protein acted as a buffer against changes in mature RFP concentration.
Using a faster maturing RFP would however significantly improve the results.
This implies that the system works better on proteins that do not require additional time for steps after translation.
This includes additional folding, post-translational modification and transport.
</P><H2>Conclusion</H2><P>
The repressible and inducible systems can be modelled using the ten parameters as long the lighting regime does not deviate far from completely on or completely off states.
The model is more accurate for the repressible.
However, the errors observe indicate that the model still needs more work to provide comprehensice coverage for the various situations the system may be subjected to.
In particular, the validity assumptions need be reassessed while concentrations of the intermediates should be measured during future work.

The Wet lab plans to allow the cell to grow up until OD = 0.6 before triggering the cell to produce colour producing enzymes (doing so allows the cell to conserve resources for cell growth). This graph shows that OD reaches 0.6 at t = 4 h and approaches steady-state at about 2 after t =10 hr.</P><P>At t = 4 h, we intend to switch OFF the light using the light REPRESSIBLE system to allow the cell to produce the enzymes that catalyse colour bioproduction.

This is due to the leakiness (k<SUB>rep</SUB>) from the blue light repressible promoter, a parameter obtained from model fittings in Part 3. </P><P> After light is turned OFF at t = 4 h, repression is lifted and the production of the F3’H and FNS enzyme is increased by nearly twofold. 
The protein expression levels are different due to the difference in their synthesis rates (=protein translation rates) due to their different RBS systems. </P><P>The aforementioned 2 to 3 hour delay observed in Figure 2 has shaped our experimental design, acknowledging us that the substrate naringenin should be added 3 hours after OD reaches 0.6 (t = 4 h) because the light system has become unrepressed and more stable (healthier for cells - less stress). 
This also allows the accumulation of the two catalysed enzymes before kickstarting the bioconversion process.
