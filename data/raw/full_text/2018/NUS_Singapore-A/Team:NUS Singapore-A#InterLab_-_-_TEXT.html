OVERVIEW
A challenge of synthetic biology is repeating measurements in different laboratories. For example, fluorescence data is difficult to compare either because it is reported in different units, or because different groups handle raw data differently.           iGEM’s Measurement Committee thus aims to use the InterLab Study to eventually develop absolute units for measurements of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in a plate reader. This will improve the measurement tools of synthetic biologists.
This year, the Committee aims to discover if it is possible to reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of optical density (OD). For this, we were required           to measure the cell density of Escherichia coli (E. coli) DH5⍺ cells using the methods below.
Method 1: Converting between absorbance of cells to absorbance of a known concentration of beads
In the first method, silica beads are used to estimate the actual amount of cells during fluorescence measurement. These beads are modeled after a typical E. coli cell and are thus expected to scatter light in a similar way to E. coli cells. As a sample of these silica beads gives a consistent and known absorbance measurement at 600 nm, absorbance measurements from a sample’s cell density can be converted into an “equivalent concentration of beads” measurement that should           be more universal and comparable between different labs.
Method 2: Counting colony-forming units (CFUs) from the sample
In the second method, cell concentration is approximated is by plating a known volume of the sample and letting bacterial colonies grow. As each bacterial colony is assumed to represent a single cell (for cells that do not stick together), the           cell concentration in the sample is then directly proportional to the number of CFUs. Using a scaling factor computed from negative and positive control CFUs, a conversion factor from absorbance to CFU can be computed.

CELL MEASUREMENTS
Materials
Competent cells (Escherichia coli strain DH5α)
Luria Bertani (LB) media
Chloramphenicol (stock concentration 25 mg/ml dissolved in ethanol)
50 ml Falcon tube (wrapped with a thick layer of paper towel to block light)
1.5 ml eppendorf tubes
Incubator at 37 °C
Ice bucket with ice
96-well plate (black)
Methods
Day 1: Transforming Escherichia coli strain DH5α with devices provided in the Distribution Kit
Each device (powder form) was resuspended in 10 µl of ddH2O.
1 µl of each respective plasmid was transformed into 50 µl E. coli DH5α via electroporation.
500 µl of LB was immediately added into each tube for recovery of the transformed cells.
Each sample tube was incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 30 mins before 100 µl of each sample was plated onto LB + Chlor agar plates and grown overnight at 37 °C.
Day 2: Selecting Colonies and Growing Cells Overnight
2 colonies were selected for being both relatively bigger and more separated from the other colonies.
The selected colonies were then inoculated into 5 ml of LB + Chlor and grown overnight at 37 °C at 220 rpm.
Day 3: Cell Growth, Sampling and Assay
Part 1: Abs600nm and Fluorescence Measurement
A cell stock of each overnight culture was made in glycerol for storage, in case there is a need to use them again. To make this stock, 850 µl of culture was added to 350 µl of glycerol.
A 1:10 dilution of each overnight culture was made in LB + Chlor (0.5 mL culture + 4.5 mL media).
Abs600nm of the 1:10 diluted cultures were measured.
Cultures were diluted further to a target Abs600nm of 0.02 in a final volume of 12 ml LB + Chlor in a 50 ml falcon tube that was covered with tissue paper.
500 µl of samples of the diluted cultures at 0 h were transferred into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes labelled A and B. The tubes were placed on ice until they were ready to be laid out according to the plate diagram to measure fluorescence and Abs600.               Fluorescence readings at T = 0 h are shown in Fig. 6.
The rest of the cultures were incubated at 37 °C and 220 rpm for 6 hours.
After the 6-hour-incubation, 500 µl of these cultures were transferred into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes before being laid out according to the plate diagram below. The samples’ fluorescence and Abs600nm were measured again. Fluorescence readings               at T = 6 h are shown in Fig. 7.
Part 2: Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E. coli Cultures
Only Positive Control (BBa_I20270) cultures and Negative Control (BBa_R0040) were involved in this part.
Overnight cultures were diluted 10-fold in LB + Chlor media to ensure they lay in the linear detection range of our plate reader.
The OD600nm of cell cultures were measured. Our results are reflected by Fig. 8.
Overnight cultures were diluted to OD600 = 0.1 in 1 ml of LB + Chlor media. Each culture was done in triplicate.
Diluted overnight cultures were checked to ensure that OD600 = 0.1, excluding the blank measurement
For each starting sample, serial dilutions were prepared as shown in Fig. 9.
100 µl of Dilutions 3, 4 and 5 were aseptically spread on LB + Chlor agar plates.
The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C.
Colonies on each plate were counted. Our results are reflected by Fig. 10.

DISCUSSION
Abs600 nm
We inferred the rate of colony growth from net Abs600 values - a common method for measuring cell concentration. All cells except for cells transformed with Devices 1 and 5 had comparable rates of growth. In cells transformed with Devices 1 and 5,       the increase in net Abs600 was significantly slower than cells transformed with the rest of the devices (Fig. 5, 6).
Figure 5: Graph comparing the net Abs600 at T = 0 h for each colony using each control/device.
Figure 6: Graph comparing the net Abs600 at T = 6 h for each colony using each control/device.
µM Fluorescein per OD
Cells transformed with Devices 1, 4 and 5 had the highest fluorescein readings per OD (Fig. 7, 8). The µM of fluorescein per OD of cells transformed with Device 3 were very low and at levels comparable to cells transformed with the negative control.           On the other hand, cells transformed with Devices 2 and 6 had similar µM fluorescein per OD to that of cells transformed with the positive control. Similar trends were observed for Molecules of Equivalent Fluorescence Level (MEFL)/particle (Fig.           9, 10).

Figure 10: Graph comparing the Molecules of Equivalent Fluorescent Level (MEFL) per particle at T = 6 h for each colony using each control/device.
Derivations/Inferences made about devices
Despite growing at a considerably slower rate, fluorescein readings per OD of cells transformed with Devices 1 and 5 were among the highest. The high GFP production in cells transformed with Devices 1 and 5 might have caused a unhealthy metabolic stress on the cells, which, in turn, could have impeded the growth of the cells.
Cells transformed with Device 4 had a slightly lower fluorescein reading per OD as compared to cells transformed with Devices 1 and 5. Since there was no compromise on the cell growth rate despite the high GFP production, the slightly lower GFP production (as compared to cells transformed with Devices 1 and 5) was inferred to have permitted the cells to grow at normal rates, leading to an overall higher net fluorescein reading.
Cells transformed with Device 3 was observed to produce very little to no GFP. Promoter within Device 3 might have been repressed by a molecule present in the cells, or not activated, to result in minimal GFP expression.
Conclusion about devices
Devices 1 and 5 were inferred to have highest promoter strength upstream of the GFP gene. While they produced the highest fluorescein readings per OD, overexpression of GFP as a result of Devices 1 and 5 do not seem to be healthy for cells: cells were not observed to be able to cope with the overly high expression of GFP. In the same argument, Device 4 seemed to be the most advantageous for the experimenter: there was a high GFP production without a compromise of growth rate. Cells transformed with Device 4 seemed to be able to manage the level of metabolic stress and grow normally.
CFU/mL/OD
Based on the data, NCA, NCB, PCA, PCB averages were computed based on counted CFU units. The percentage errors computed based on the known concentrations of beads against their respective averages showed high error levels.

This suggests that the concentration of microsphere beads cannot be used to reliably predict cell concentration levels. It is possible that the silica beads are not a good model of E. coli cells and thus were unable to reproduce results characteristic of the cells.
Our team proceeded to calculate a conversion factor k to relate cell concentration to optical density.

CONCLUSION
The results from our experiment seem to indicate that normalizing fluorescence measurements to absolute cell count using the Study’s two methods will not be able to reduce lab-to-lab variability because counting colony-forming units do not return the expected cell concentration, i.e. the cell concentration modeled by the silica beads in Method 1. While both methods cannot be used independently to establish a robust fluorescence measurement system, it may be possible that lab-to-lab variability can be reduced if a different method of normalizing to absolute cell count is devised, replacing Method 1, Method 2, or both.

We’re a little disruptive, dangerous and maybe a tad too bold. But the world needs some shaking up every now and then, and we think we’re just the right people for that.
Together we’re going to engineer biology and create something awesome.
