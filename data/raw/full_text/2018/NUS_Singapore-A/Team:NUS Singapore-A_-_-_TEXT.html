Biomanufacturing opens up possibilities for sustainable
production of useful materials.
We, Team NUSGEM, created Coup Dy’état,
an environmentally-friendly platform to advance biomanufacturing.
Discover our project
Current biomanufacturing platforms are
chemical-intensive and expensive.
Coup Dy’état is not only environmentally-friendly, but also potentially cheaper.
Find out how we designed our platform
Integrating findings from our human practices has helped us make sure that our platform is relevant and useful to biomanufacturers.
Find out who we spoke to
To prove that our platform works, we decided to produce flavonoids to be used as dyes.
This is because the textile dyeing and dyestuff production industry is the second most pollutive industry in the world.
Our biomanufacturing platform can
help.
See our results
No system would work without its support.
Find out how we modelled our complete system and how we built our hardware system to support our platform.
Our team of 13 is made up intensely motivated students across all disciplines.

We are thrilled to announce that Coup Dy’état has won a Gold Medal and obtained 3 nominations for special awards: Best Manufacturing Project, Best Hardware, and the Safety Commendation. Thank you for being with us on our iGEM journey!
Join us in our vision for the
Biomanufacturing of the Future.

HEAR OUR STORY
We’re using synthetic biology to change the way the world thinks and functions.
We’re a little disruptive, dangerous and maybe a tad too bold. But the world needs some shaking up every now and then, and we think we’re just the right people for that.
Together we’re going to engineer biology and create something awesome.
