These two problems are: the lack of tools to help optogenetic researchers scale up their research, and the need to continue optimizing optogenetic biomanufacturing. </P><BUTTON class="accordion">PROBLEM #1 - LACK OF TOOLS</BUTTON><DIV class="panel"><P>The first problem is that while there is a rapidly-growing interest in using optogenetics for biomanufacturing<SUP>[1]</SUP>, development of custom tools to support the research of optogenetic circuits cannot match this pace, and is insufficient to meet user needs<SUP>[2]</SUP>. An example of the most current hardware tools available is a modified Tecan microplate reader, which provides controlled illumination on top of its usual measurement capabilities<SUP>[3]</SUP>. Such an approach is costly and requires specialized knowledge of the microplate reader model. Another example would be the open-source light exposure tool constructed for a 24-well plate<SUP>[4]</SUP>. To our team, it seemed that scaling-up in optogenetic research (Figure 1) was not well-supported by current hardware solutions, which only cater to microwell plates.</P><FIGURE class="figures" style="width: 60%;"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 1.</B> Scaling-up in optogenetics research - from the microplate to small-scale bioreactor</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Yet, the biomanufacturing industry is expected to deliver products to the market, in high volumes, at high quality, and at competitive prices<SUP>[5]</SUP>. If we are ever to bring our optogenetic biomanufacturing platform to an industrial scale, it is necessary to bridge the gap between the microplate and the industrial bioreactor, and adapt our cells for actual large-scale bioreactor conditions. We thus designed a suite of three devices, called <I>PDF-LA!</I>, which enables the characterization of optogenetic circuits at different scales - 12-well <B>P</B>late, petri <B>D</B>ish, and conical <B>F</B>lask (Figure 2).</P><FIGURE class="figures" style="width: 60%;"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 2</B>. PDF-LA!.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>We also created a bench-top optogenetic bioreactor, <I>Light Wait</I>.</P><FIGURE class="figures" style="width: 60%;"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 3</B>. Light Wait.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>It is our vision that these devices will empower optogenetic researchers to make great leaps forward in their research, although we acknowledge that there is a still-greater leap between our humble bioreactor and an industrial bioreactor (Figure 4). For now, it is enough for us to have taken the first few steps.</P><FIGURE class="figures" style="width: 60%;"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 4</B>. The components in Figure 1 (bottom right-hand corner) are still dwarfed by an industrial bioreactor.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><BUTTON class="accordion-closer">CLOSE</BUTTON></DIV><BUTTON class="accordion">PROBLEM #2 - NEED FOR FURTHER OPTIMIZATION</BUTTON><DIV class="panel"><P>The second problem is that although a proof-of-concept already exists for optogenetic biomanufacturing, the process can be further optimized to bring the vision of an industrial-scale optogenetic bioreactor closer to reality. 
    For some background, Zhao et al. have increased yield of isobutanol from yeast by using a blue light repressible system in a simple bioreactor, showing the potential of optogenetics in biomanufacturing<SUP>[6]</SUP>. However, they did not optimize the duration or intensity of blue light, instead shining blue light periodically. Reportedly, the team is considering adding biosensors that can automatically switch the light source on and off, so as to improve efficiency<SUP>[7]</SUP>. We decided to try tackling this challenge. In the process, we discovered that dynamic regulation is a good method for optimizing biomanufacturing, because prioritization of growth and production can be achieved simultaneously. We distilled this observation from both literature<SUP>[8]</SUP> and our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:NUS_Singapore-A/Human_Practices">Human Practices</A> activities. Dynamic regulation can be achieved through computer-assisted feedback control, and we found that Argeitis et. al developed automated optogenetic feedback control for precise and robust regulation of gene expression and cell growth<SUP>[9]</SUP>. So far this is the most recent and sophisticated feedback system for optogenetics. However, after examining his method, we found that while his feedback control system was closed-loop, his physical system was open. Measurement samples were discarded as waste. This is not advantageous to biomanufacturing, as this will lead to much product being wasted, lowering effective yield. 
    To solve this, we combined the insights and design features from these two systems (Zhao and Argeitis) to create an automated, closed-loop feedback control system for <I>Light Wait</I>.

Cells harboring blue light repressible RFP (fused with YbaQ degradation tag) expression plasmid Brep-RFP-YbaQ were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth medium supplemented with Kanamycin (Km) (50 μg/mL) at 37˚C with shaking speed at 225 RPM. Before starting the experiment, the overnight culture was refreshed in LB with kanamycin in shaking incubator. The cell density (absorbance at 600 nm) and red fluorescence protein (RFP) expression (excitation and emission wavelengths at 535 nm and 600 nm respectively) were measured using microplate reader (H1, Biotek, USA). The optogenetic bioreactor, Light Wait was housed in a large shaking incubator, the temperature was maintained at 37˚C and shaking speed was set at 225 RPM. The refreshed cell culture was mixed with fresh LB to make a total volume of 500 ml in the bioreactor chamber. Cell samples were drawn from the bioreactor at different time point to obtain different OD600 and RFP. The calibration of bioreactor OD and RFP sensors was done by comparing the data against the readings acquired from microplate reader. During the cell growth phase (OD600 less than 0.6), bioreactor’s build-in blue light was shone to repress the RFP expression. The blue light would be turned off automatically by the computer when the OD600 exceed 0.6, and subsequently the RFP could be expressed (production phase). Blue light would be turned on again once RFP reading reaches 900, this would stop RFP expression.</P><H3>Experimental Results</H3><P>Please visit <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:NUS_Singapore-A/Results"><U>Results:Cell-Machine Interface</U></A> for the outcomes of our experimental plans.</P><BUTTON class="accordion">HOW IT WORKS</BUTTON><DIV class="panel"><H3>Operation</H3><P>This operation guide assumes that all components have been assembled and programmed.
