This part contains the coding sequence of mRFP put under control of the stress promoter PhtpG1. The promoter, PhtpG1, was carefully chosen because of sensitivity to synthetic construct-induced burden in <I>E. coli</I>. This distinct characteristic is especially valuable to our system because we were interested in quantifying real-time levels of stress generated by the expression of externally introduced constructs.  

In our experiments, we were interested in the depletion of finite cellular resources during the expression of synthetic constructs constitutes an unwanted burden, which we define as cell stress, hampering the growth and expected the performance of engineered cells in an unpredictable manner. Stress regulation has been shown to enable cells to outperform their unregulated counterparts in terms of</P></DIV><DIV class="column right"><P> 

protein yield, a remarkable discovery which we believe will have significant implications in the biomanufacturing field. 

By quantifying cell stress via fluorescence, recombinant protein production can be optimized by the user simply by reducing cell stress i.e. switching off protein production (in our case, this can be done by turning on blue light).

Additionally, according to Ceroni et al. (2018), PhtpG1 displayed the best on/off characteristic out of the 4 promoters that were being investigated (htpG1, htpG2, groSL, and ibpAB). This feature allows the stress-reporting module, PhtpG1-mRFP, to not only respond rapidly, but also to maintain its receptivity in a dynamic cell microenvironment. </P></DIV></DIV><H1>Summary of Results</H1><P><OL><LI>PhtpG1-mRFP <U><B>can work in different genetic backgrounds</B></U>.

To show that our stress reporter part is sensitive to externally introduced constructs which produce foreign proteins (i.e., GFP), we set up an experiment as described in the methods below. Figure 6: A, B (below) shows the different test constructs that were used in the experiment. We were interested in stress induced by GFP production, in particular, because of its universal use as a reporter. Through this set of experiment, we aimed to find out if GFP production indeed leads to increase levels in cell stress.

All values were corrected by using LB and respective antibiotics as blanks (streptomycin and/or kanamycin and/or ampicillin). For this experiment, we included two biological replicates to test our experimental strain (GFP+RFP A and GFP+RFP B).</P><H2><B>Results</B></H2><P>Figure 1A shows that there is an <U><B>overall trend of increased RFU per OD<SUB>600</SUB> over time</B></U>. This is indicative of <U><B>increased cell stress over time </B></U> since transcription of the mRFP gene is under the stress-inducible promoter, PhtpG1. By comparing fluorescence units per OD<SUB>600</SUB> between control and experimental strains at the 24 h time point (see Figure 1B), we demonstrated that GFP production in cells caused about a <U><B>0.5 fold increase</B></U> in RFU per OD levels, suggesting that there is an equivalent increase in cell stress. This data shows that our stress-reporting module PhtpG1-mRFP is not only successful in reporting cell stress but also sensitive and responsive to the presence of externally introduced constructs.</P><P>In order to confirm that GFP production contributed to the increase in RFP levels in the cell, we had to prove that GFP was properly expressed. To do so, we measured GFP levels (FU) per OD<SUB>600</SUB>. Figure 1C illustrates that GFU per OD<SUB>600</SUB> in the control strain remains consistently low with little additional increase. This data shows that the control strain does not produce any GFP as is expected.

This is more clearly presented in Figure 1D, in which GFU per OD<SUB>600</SUB>  levels at the 24 hour time point for strains GFP+RFP A and GFP+RFP B are substantially higher than that of the control strain.

This set of experiments is an extension of ‘Characterization using Pcon-GFP’.

Cells were grown in 7 mL LB (and relevant antibiotics) in a 50 mL Falcon tube at 25°C in the shaking incubator at 220 rpm. 100 µL of each sample was extracted at 0, 2, 4, 6, 24 h time points in triplicates to measure fluorescence (GFP/mRFP) and OD<SUB>600</SUB> using microplate reader (BioTek).

Changing the temperature at which the experiment was conducted from 37°C to 25°C also did not change the trend observed at the 24 hour time point. The expression of the de novo plasmid generated the highest level of mRFP per OD<SUB>600</SUB>, followed by the expression of Pcon-GFP (see Figure 4B). Albeit sharing the same trend, the absolute mRFP per OD<SUB>600</SUB> values are lower than the values observed in the experiment conducted at 37°C.

Additionally, the overall trend of mRFP levels per OD<SUB>600</SUB> over the 24 hour time period differed slightly from that of being observed in the experiment conducted at 37°C. 25°C, being a lower temperature, evidently slowed down growth in the cells, which in turn, explains why in hours 2-6, mRFP/GFP per OD<SUB>600</SUB> were unusually high since fluorescence levels were divided by very small OD<SUB>600</SUB> values. After the 6 hour mark, there is a steady increase in mRFP per OD<SUB>600</SUB> levels for all three samples, following which, the trend returns as is expected.

Given that characterization of the stress reporting module in DH5α was successful i.e. we were able to demonstrate that externally introduced synthetic constructs led to greater production of RFP in cells (RFP levels being deemed to be indicative of cell stress), we set out to measure the level of stress generated by the introduction of two constructs involved in the production of apigenin.<B>Methods</B>
Cells were grown in 7 mL LB (and relevant antibiotics) in a 50 mL Falcon tube at 37°C in the shaking incubator at 220 rpm. 100 µL of each sample was extracted at 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 24 h time points in triplicates to measure fluorescence (GFP/RFP) and OD<SUB>600</SUB> using microplate reader (BioTek). All values were corrected by using LB and respective antibiotics as blanks (streptomycin and/or kanamycin and/or ampicillin and/or chloramphenicol).<B>Results</B>
The expression of FNS generates a comparatively greater level of mRFP expression compared to the production of just GFP, but a lower level of mRFP expression compared to the large de novo plasmid (see Figure 4). This is expected given that the de novo plasmid carries three genes coding for OsPKS MCS and 4CL while Brep-FNS and pBAD-FNS only carries EL222/FNS and FNS respectively. The difference in mRFP per OD600 levels between Brep-FNS as compared to pBAD-FNS can be explained by the additional protein, EL222, expressed only in the Brep-FNS test construct (see Figure 6, Set-up E). This further supports our hypothesis that <U><B>PhtpG1-mRFP is sensitive to the size/amount of of foreign proteins expressed in the cell.</B></U></P><FONT size="3"><B>Figure 5</B>: PCDF-RFP (red) is a control strain as in Setup B in Figure 6 (see below) that carries only the stress promoter module.
