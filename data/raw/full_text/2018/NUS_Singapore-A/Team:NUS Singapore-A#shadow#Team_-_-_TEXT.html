NANDA WANG NUO'EN
Biomedical Engineering
ROLE
Team Leader, Head of Wet Lab, Member of Science Team, Marketing Team, Safety Team, and Human Practices Team
AMBITION
Nanda hopes to make the world a better place in any way she can, which includes helping anyone in need of her love and support. She’s one ambitious lady; she hopes to pick up as many skills as possible and be a Jack of all trades and Master of some. She envisions her future self as someone who would not only make significant contributions to the society, but also empower others, especially the underprivileged, to pursue their dreams. Aside from these, she has also been secretly wishing to have a celestial star named after her in future.
INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HER
Usually people can't tell which country is she from because of her rather unique name - it's not very Singaporean but she's born and bred in Singapore! Perhaps because of her multilingual name, she is skilled at doing English-Chinese translation, and would probably make a career of it if she can’t find employment related to her main degree.
NUR LIYANA BINTE AYUB OW YONG
Life Sciences
ROLE
Team Leader, Head of Creative, Member of Science Team and Wet Lab Team
AMBITION
Liyana’s ultimate goal is to dedicate her life to humanitarian work, and be a powerful voice for women and children who have none. She also strives to help others recognize their own worth. As a side project, she’s working on inventing teleportation.
INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HER
She loves it when people teach her things they’re passionate about. Languages, carpentry, sewing, bring it on! (Especially quantum mechanics someone please teach her please please please she really needs it for her teleportation thing...)
WU JIACHENG
Engineering Science
ROLE
Head of Wiki, Head of Hardware
AMBITION
Jiacheng’s dream is uncomplicated. He just wants to travel around the world.
INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HIM
He loves philosophy. Thankfully, the kind of philosophy he’s inclined towards is not Sartre’s “Hell is other people” or Schopenhauer’s relentless pessimism, but more Lao Tzu’s “Simplicity, patience, compassion.” (Editor’s note: It is with deepest           regret that I announce the premature demise of the editorial gerbils, Pinky and The Brian. Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit was too much to handle. This intellectual deficiency will be rectified in the next generation of editorial gerbils.)
ZHU TINGTING
Life Sciences
ROLE
Member of Science Team, Wet Lab Team, Safety Team, and Creative Team
AMBITION
Ting Ting has a passion for fashion, and hopes to combine this with what she’s learning as a life sciences student.
INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HER
For some incredibly odd reason, pigs stop when they meet Ting Ting. One day she may accidentally cause a traffic jam, either because all those pigs are blocking the way, or because she’s the chicest chica around.
MARCUS CHAN
Biomedical Engineering
ROLE
Head of Modelling, Member of Creative Team and Hardware Team
AMBITION
When Marcus was a wee lad, he wanted to become a reality television star so he constantly practiced throwing drinks on everyone bar complete strangers. This dream was cruelly dashed so he’s studying biomedical engineering instead, in the hopes of becoming rich enough to own a lawn. He covets this hallowed, immaculate patch of greenery solely for the pleasure of being able to yell at young humans to GET OFF HIS LAWN.
INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HIM
He loves feeling moisturized. Please send him many free samples of moisturizer.
RITA
TVARITA SHIVAKUMAR IYER
Material Science Engineering
ROLE
Head of Outreach, Member of Human Practices Team, Wet Lab Team, Hardware Team, and Creative Team
AMBITION
Tvarita is a connoisseur of ice lemon tea. She plans on starting a blog introducing plebeians such as ourselves to the finest ice lemon teas known to mankind.
INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HER
Tvarita’s a vegetarian!
LAM SZE TUNG WALTER
Medicine
ROLE
Deputy Treasurer, Head of Human Practices, Editor of the Wiki, Member of Marketing Team
AMBITION
Walter dreams of being the world's deadliest spy or becoming part of a secret intelligence organisation. He is also interested in having a dish named after him, getting crowned champion of an IKEA hotdog speed-eating contest, or defusing a bomb whilst performing open heart surgery in a war-torn country. Failing which, Walter is quite satisfied with being able to wake up on time for his lessons (which start at the eminently reasonable time of 12pm had Walter been living in Honolulu instead).
INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HIM
He is a rather cunning linguist, having attained a respectable degree of fluency in English, Chinese, Cantonese, French, Spanish, and sarcasm.
LEOW CHUNG YONG AARON
Biomedical Engineering
ROLE
Treasurer, Head of Marketing, Head of Human Practices, Member of Science Team and Wet Lab Team
AMBITION
He wants to be an academic researcher and a technopreneur. He loves all sorts of animals and admires Taylor Nicole Dean and her pets. Perhaps that is why he desires his very own pogo stick, so he can bounce and frolic alongside his furry friends like the loveliest, prettiest Disney princess there ever was.
INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HIM
He owns many pairs of broken shoes (including trainers), worn out in his never-ending quest to be a Pokémon trainer.)
RUSSELL NGO
Chemical Engineering
ROLE
Member of Modelling Team, Science Team, and Wiki Team
AMBITION
Russell strongly believes in change, and thinks that synthetic biology is one of the keys to change, which is why he’s taking part in iGEM.
INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HIM
He tried to join the previous year’s iGEM team, but was unsuccessful due to unfortunate circumstances beyond his control. However, this year he’s finally here, and raring to go! If anything else, it speaks to his tremendous passion for synthetic biology and demonstrates his sheer tenacity. Russell also enjoys taking naps at lunchtime, and feels very much at home in IKEA, especially during lunchtime. His favourite pop artiste is Norlie & KKV.
YANG HAO YUAN
Life Sciences
ROLE
Head of Science, Member of Wet Lab Team, Modelling Team, and Human Practices Team
AMBITION
Hao Yuan aspires to do something good using (surprise, surprise) synthetic biology. Other less lofty life goals include re-learning how to play the piano, watching his beloved football team in the flesh, and learning Japanese so he can finally watch anime without subtitles.
INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HIM
Besides being a science buff, he’s also physically buff! He plays tennis using tables rather than rackets. (Editor’s Note: The editorial gerbils report that something may have been lost in transcription. The editor thus warns that the accuracy of Hao Yuan’s interesting fact may have been compromised, an understandable result of salvaging the remains of Hao Yuan’s files from gerbil excrement.)
RYAN LEONG WEI REN
Architecture
ROLE
Designer-in-Residence
AMBITION
Ryan is a “design-author” who enjoys conceptualising creative products using graphic illustrations, craftwork, and creative storytelling across many topics, from architecture to fashion. He hopes to transform experiences, add value wherever he goes, and inspire purpose in others throughout his artful adventures.
INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HIM
He’s always stuck with Laurel in Blue, and is still hoping for Yanny in Gold.
BEATRIX TUNG XUE LIN
Mechanical Engineering
ROLE
Chief Editor of the Wiki, Member of Modelling Team, Human Practices Team, Hardware Team, and Safety Team
AMBITION
Beatrix wishes to infiltrate the human race, following in the footsteps of her illustrious predecessors Ford Prefect and J’onn J’onnz. She is currently working on appearing perfectly normal in public, and absorbing as much human knowledge as is alienly possible. Participating in iGEM to learn more about synthetic biology is all part of her plan for world domination.
INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HER
With the help of some good old-fashioned British sci-fi technology, she owns a hammerhead shark named Clarence whose former self currently exists alongside its present self, thus contravening the First Law of Time.
AARON RAMZEEN
Biomedical Engineering
ROLE
Member of Wiki Team, Modelling Team, Human Practices Team, and Hardware Team
AMBITION
Aaron dreams of growing up to be a porcelain Bugatti Veyron ready to experience the quantum headspace of the vast unknown. In addition, he wants to stop being mistaken for the other Aaron.
INTERESTING FACT ABOUT HIM
His iGEM account name is evilsexycurry. Apparently, there is a lengthy tale rivalling The Blah Story regarding how he chose these three words to describe himself. He has yet to delight us with this fascinating chapter from his personal history, and remains an evil and sexy curry of mystery.
HEAR OUR STORY
We’re using synthetic biology to change the way the world thinks and functions.
We’re a little disruptive, dangerous and maybe a tad too bold. But the world needs some shaking up every now and then, and we think we’re just the right people for that.
Together we’re going to engineer biology and create something awesome.
