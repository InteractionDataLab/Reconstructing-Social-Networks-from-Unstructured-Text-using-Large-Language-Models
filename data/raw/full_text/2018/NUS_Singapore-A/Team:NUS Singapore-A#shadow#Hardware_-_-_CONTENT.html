An example of the most current hardware tools available is a modified Tecan microplate reader, which provides controlled illumination on top of its usual measurement capabilities<SUP>[3]</SUP>. Such an approach is costly and requires specialized knowledge of the microplate reader model. Another example would be the open-source light exposure tool constructed for a 24-well plate<SUP>[4]</SUP>. To our team, it seemed that scaling-up in optogenetic research (Figure 1) was not well-supported by current hardware solutions, which only cater to microwell plates. </P><FIGURE class="figures"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 1</B>. Scaling-up in optogenetics research - from the microplate to small-scale bioreactor</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Yet, the biomanufacturing industry is expected to deliver products to the market, in high volumes, at high quality, and at competitive prices<SUP>[5]</SUP>. If we are ever to bring our optogenetic biomanufacturing platform to an industrial scale, it is necessary to bridge the gap between the microplate and the industrial bioreactor, and adapt our cells for actual large-scale bioreactor conditions. We thus designed a suite of three devices, called <I>PDF-LA!</I>, which enables the characterization of optogenetic circuits at different scales - 12-well <B><U>P</U></B>late, petri <B><U>D</U></B>ish, and conical <B><U>F</U></B>lask. We also created a bench-top optogenetic bioreactor, <I>Light Wait</I>. It is our vision that these devices will empower optogenetic researchers to make great leaps forward in their research, although we acknowledge that there is a still-greater leap between our humble bioreactor and an industrial bioreactor (Figure 2). For now, it is enough for us to have taken the first few steps.</P><FIGURE class="figures"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 2</B>. The components in Figure 1 (bottom right-hand corner) are still dwarfed by an industrial bioreactor.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H2>Problem #2</H2><P>The second problem is that although a proof-of-concept already exists for optogenetic biomanufacturing, the process can be further optimized to bring the vision of an industrial-scale optogenetic bioreactor closer to reality. </P><P>For some background, Zhao et al. have increased yield of isobutanol from yeast by using a blue light repressible system in a simple bioreactor, showing the potential of optogenetics in biomanufacturing<SUP>[6]</SUP>. However, they did not optimize the duration or intensity of blue light, instead shining blue light periodically. We discovered that dynamic regulation is a good method for optimizing biomanufacturing, because prioritization of growth and production can be achieved simultaneously. We distilled this observation from both literature<SUP>[7]</SUP> and our <A href="#">Human Practice</A> activities. Dynamic regulation can be achieved through computer-assisted feedback control, and we found that Argeitis et. al developed automated optogenetic feedback control for precise and robust regulation of gene expression and cell growth<SUP>[8]</SUP>. So far this is the most recent and sophisticated feedback system for optogenetics. However after examining his method, we found that while his feedback control system was closed-loop, his physical system was open. Measurement samples were discarded as waste. This is not advantageous to biomanufacturing, as this will lead to much product being wasted, lowering effective yield.</P><P>
To solve this, we combined the insights and design features from these two systems (Zhao and Argeitis) to create an automated, closed-loop feedback control system for <I>Light Wait</I>.</P><H3>PDF-LA!</H3><H4>Function</H4><P>Plate-Dish-Flask Light Apparatus (<I>PDF-LA!</I>) supports optogenetic research by allowing researchers to investigate cells cultured in 12-well plates, petri dishes, and Erlenmeyer flasks.</P><H4>Product Demonstration</H4><FIGURE class="figures"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 2</B>. gif in progress</FIGCAPTION><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 1</B>.

Many configurations are possible, enabling researchers to customize their experimental setups to a greater degree. While P-LA! was designed separately and thus does not have this functionality, a final solution, <A href="#"><I>PDF-LA! 2.0</I></A>, to provide a truly integrated solution was designed and can be found on our dedicated page for <A href="#"><I>PDF-LA!</I></A>.
