The largest of fourteen faculties and schools at NUS, the Faculty has grown from 300 students in the late 1970s to close to 10,000 strong today. Today, we are a vibrant community with ten departments and programmes, and is among the top 10 in the world for engineering and technology. 
      
      NUS Engineering’s mission is to nurture Engineer-Leaders with a global perspective and to lead in technology through high-impact research. Celebrating its 60th Anniversary in 2015, the Faculty has contributed substantially to the rapid industrial and economic growth of the nation while continuing to contribute to a knowledge-based economy.
      
      With an increasing international student and staff population, the Faculty has developed into a truly cosmopolitan environment for tertiary education, emphasising both fundamentals and applications.</P></DIV><BUTTON class="accordion">Synthetic Biology for Clinical and Technological Innovation (SynCTI)</BUTTON><DIV class="panel"><P>NUS Synthetic Biology for Clinical and Technological Innovation (SynCTI) was formally established in Jan 2015 as the focal research program for synthetic biology at the National University of Singapore. SynCTI operates as a highly interdisciplinary research core that amalgamates leading Principal Investigators from Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Engineering. SynCTI aims to anchor Singapore as one of the leading Synthetic Biology Hubs in the world and to develop novel biological and biologically-based systems with advanced clinical and industrial applications. Through research collaborations with renowned international institutes and private industries, SynCTI strives to create new knowledge and develop foundational technologies in synthetic biology and groom future generations of highly skilled researchers endowed with basic science and translational research capabilities.</P></DIV><H1>Gold Sponsors</H1><BUTTON class="accordion">Axil Scientific</BUTTON><DIV class="panel"><P>Since 1998, Axil Scientific have served the life science research market in Singapore with our vast experience in Sales, Distribution, Manufacturing and Sales Channel Management.
