Our team this year is comprised of eleven amazing, enthusiastic, and hardworking highschool students who have a common passion for science and helping to change the world!
Elian Dupre

My name is Elian Dupre, and I'm 17 years old in Grade 12 at Our Lady of the Snows Catholic Academy. I was born in Cuba (yes, I can speak Spanish!) and have been in Canmore for 13 years. I have two pilot's licenses and love to fly on the weekends. My pass-time hobbies include coding and video games. After high school I look to becoming an aerospace engineer. I joined iGEM to make a difference in the world, and love every bit of it!
Pranavi Thota
SynBio Wetlab Team Leader
Hey! My name is Pranavi Thota, I am 17 years old and in Grade 12 at Our Lady of the Snows Catholic Academy. I was born in India and moved to Canada when I was one. I like to paint, dance, take pictures(nature photography), listen to music, hangout with friends and watch movies. I am a science geek. I love the sciences and have an interest in pursuing the sciences. Synthetic biology is very interesting and had grabbed my attention very quickly when I found out my school had an iGEM team. I love learning about the small world of cells and what they can do to solve a problem when you manipulating their DNA. Such a small bacteria can solve such a huge problem. I joined the team to solve a huge problem with science.

I am a para-alpine ski racer, computer geek, and master in the art of making life hard for myself. I joined iGEM because I am passionate about science and want to do something to help solve the problems in our world. When not in the lab (or various associated Google Docs), I can be found arguing with people (I’m a debater), playing with my two Labradors, and watching science videos on YouTube.

Having lived in Canmore my whole life, I hold the natural environment in very high regard. I was very excited that our project has the potential to make an amazing difference in our global environment by reducing the plastics that end up in landfills.

Wetlab Co-Ed Team Leader
Hello! My name is Avi Lamb, I am 15 years old and in grade 11. I have been a competitive swimmer for 10 years and love the water, especially the ocean. I was born in England and moved to Canada at the age of 5. Because I live in the mountains I am constantly surrounded by nature, and being in the environment you become more aware of the effect of pollution and specifically plastic pollution. I am very passionate about helping the environment and reducing the harmful waste that people are creating. This is why I decided to join iGem, I wanted to create a change and help the environment in anyway I could.

My name is Sonia Maier, I am 16 years old and in grade 11. My hobbies include swimming, dancing, surfing, freediving and scuba diving. I have 6 different diving certifications through PADI and I have spent more than a day underwater diving. With our team focussing on plastics and the effect that they have on our environment I felt a strong connection to our project. Along with my love for the ocean and nature came my determination to solve issues created by humans in our world. After graduating high school I plan on pursuing a career in Marine Biology.

Hi, My name is Jess Puurunen and I am 37 ¾ years old.  I have been a teacher for some time, but a science student for much, much longer (blew things up at daycare, read the periodic table in utero, etc.).  I love learning new things, especially with enthusiastic young people.  When I’m not in the lab, I am mountain biking, hiking, doing yoga, cooking elaborate meals, chasing my 7-year old around the park, and otherwise loving life!
