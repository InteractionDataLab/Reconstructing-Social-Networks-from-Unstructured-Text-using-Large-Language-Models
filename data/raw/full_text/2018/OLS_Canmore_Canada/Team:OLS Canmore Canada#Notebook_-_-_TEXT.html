NOTEBOOK
For the past two years, our team has been meeting weekly for a “working lunch” on Wednesdays, and collaborating together after school each Friday afternoon.  Friday activities varied from growing cells and autoclaving waste to calling community members and prototyping.  It also included harassing our Robotics team (who work next door) to build us a real-live prototype.  We are very grateful for our time to work together on an extra-curricular project of our own design!
