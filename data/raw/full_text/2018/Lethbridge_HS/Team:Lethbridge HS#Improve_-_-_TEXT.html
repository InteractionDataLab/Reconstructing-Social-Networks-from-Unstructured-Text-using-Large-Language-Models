IMPROVED PART
Cup 1
Original Part: BBa_K586000
Submitted Part: GreenfieldINUSA 2011
Designed by: Chris Thompson
Rationale behind improvement: We have improved this part by introducing a hexahistidine tag to it, this has proven to be the optimal length for purification. Adding the histidine tag creates the opportunity to use a simpler method of purification, as well as increase selectivity for the desired protein.
