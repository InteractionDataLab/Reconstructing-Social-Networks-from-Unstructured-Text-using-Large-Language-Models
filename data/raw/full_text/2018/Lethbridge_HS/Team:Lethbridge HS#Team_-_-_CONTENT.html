I like to spend time in the wet lab and work on human practices mainly, though modeling interests me as well. I look forward to a future that hopefully involves more iGEM! Outside of iGEM I spend time playing badminton, eating watermelon, and procrastinating (working hard on fixing that, iGEM is proving that this is NOT effective).
