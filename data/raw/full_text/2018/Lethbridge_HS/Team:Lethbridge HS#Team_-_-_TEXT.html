STUDENTS
Nimaya De Silva
Undergraduate
Hello! My name is Nimaya De Silva, and I am 18 years old. I just graduated from Winston Churchill High School. Starting this fall, I will be entering the biomedical sciences program at the University of Calgary. This is now my third year of iGEM. I joined iGEM to gain more experience in the lab, and to venture more into the world of biology. But I have also found myself working on human practices, and coding the wiki which has been very enjoyable! I hope to continue my experiences in iGEM in post secondary as well! Besides iGEM, I love to read anything and everything to do with dystopia and Harry Potter and love to recreate pop songs on the piano!
Mina Akbary
Grade 11
Hi!!! My name is Mina Akbary-Zheng, I am sixteen years old and I am in grade 11 at Winston Churchill High School. I was excited to join iGEM for the first time because I loved the idea of creating something completely unique with people with similar interests to me. I love designing and coding on the wiki and learning new things about lab work and synthetic biology. I have not yet decided what I want to study in post secondary but iGEM has led me towards a path in engineering or computer science. Besides iGEM, I love dancing, listening to music (Jazz, La La Land or Hamilton) and annoying my parents while singing in the shower.

Alice Zhang
Grade 11
Heylo, it’s Alice here and I am sixteen years young, attending grade 11 at Winston Churchill High School. This is my very first year of iGEM and it’s been a BLAST so far. I joined because I thought it would be interesting to get some experience in the lab and in coding. And so far, I like what I’ve been doing. My future after iGEM is undecided but I’d really love to take a year off before post-secondary to travel around Russia. In my normal life, I enjoy drinking chocolate milk, being edgy with my mains and reading. Toodles, bye.
Michelle Wu
Grade 11
Hello! My name is Michelle and I am in grade 11 at Winston Churchill High School this year. I joined iGEM because I really enjoyed biology and wanted the opportunity to experience synthetic biology as well. So far it has been amazing! Though it took me a solid 6 months to understand a majority of synthetic biology, it has been an amazing learning experience. I like to spend time in the wet lab and work on human practices mainly, though modeling interests me as well. I look forward to a future that hopefully involves more iGEM! Outside of iGEM I spend time playing badminton, eating watermelon, and procrastinating (working hard on fixing that, iGEM is proving that this is NOT effective). In addition to that, I like to run (as I have to have an abundance of energy in the worst times), and spend time with family and friends.

This is my third year advising the high school iGEM team. I love the opportunities and experiences that iGEM can give to students while they are still in high school. I have always enjoyed conducting human practices work and I think it is important for our students to understand the implications that their work can have on society. Outside of iGEM, I enjoy coffee, hanging out with my friends, working in the lab, and coffee.
Chris Isaac
Graduate
I joined iGEM in 2012 to take a chance on something new. Since then, I’ve had the pleasure of continuing to participate, mentor, and explore new ideas in synthetic biology. The best part of iGEM is the ability to engage in a meaningful multidisciplinary project and develop solutions to emerging challenges. In the future, I want to be able to bridge the worlds synthetic biology and public policy to make sure that we do the most good possible at the least cost.
Erin Kelly
Graduate
My first High School iGEM experience was actually when I was in grade 12 and participated on the Lethbridge High School iGEM team in 2012. I then went on to be an advisor to the high school team in 2013 when I started my undergraduate program. I am excited to be back instructing HS iGEM again! My favourite part about iGEM is designing genetic constructs because these molecular biology systems are so elegant. I am pursuing my MD and have completed my MSc, and hopefully maintain an emphasis on biomedical research and engineering.
Luke Saville

Dr. Laura Keffer-Wilkes
Primary PI
Hello! I am super pumped to be a part of the Lethbridge High School team this year. I am the Primary Investigator and it has been amazing working with all these awesome young people. I studied RNA modification enzymes in graduate school and love STEM outreach. This year’s iGEM team has continuously impressed me with their dedication, knowledge and creativity. I especially loved the music recital they organized. I hope you enjoyed learning about our project!
Dr. Hans-Joachim Wieden
Secondary PI
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.
Dr. Angeliki Pantazi
Instructor
A new addition to an established team! I am an Instructor at the University of Lethbridge, my background is in Medical Genetics and Cancer Genomics and this is my first time participating in iGEM. See you all in Boston!
And a big thank you to our sponsors!
