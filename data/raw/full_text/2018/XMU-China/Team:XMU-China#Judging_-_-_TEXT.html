Integrated Human Practices
In order to better design, and improve our project, as well as to meet the needs of the medical markets, we visited hospitals and vaccine companies of different scales in Xiamen. During this process, we consulted several expertized medical professors and doctors of clinical laboratory about the feasibility of our project. What's more, we asked them to point out some deficiencies in our project, where we can make further efforts in. After designing the first batch of products, we made connections with some grass-roots community hospitals and initially-stated companies, with the aim of applying the projects which successfully worked in labs to reality, so that they could be economical as well as acceptable to the target customers. Meanwhile, we also made contributions in dissipating the knowledge of basic SynBio among the public, and played a significant role in carrying out science-popularizing activities for teenagers.
Improve a previous part or project
We improved the project of Havard 2006 , especially improved their two significant composite parts, BBa_J36335 and BBa_J36336 . We also added several new basic and composite parts to confirm the new system's function. You can click here to see more details.
Model your project
This year we developed four models which play significant roles in our project.
1. Based on the hypothesis of nearest neighbor method, starting from the aspect of thermodynamics, we constructed "ABKey" function about upper limit of the length of complementary sequence, then we obtained the upper limit to assist in narrowing the choice range of our experimental materials.
2. In order to avoid false positive of dissociation of our aptamer and "complementary strand" designed under the impact of the flow, we constructed fluid dynamic model to check whether our designed rotating speed is viable or not.
3. We gave out a feasible rotating speed by dimensional analysis method to instruct the hardware.
4. We used multiple software to build 3D simulation models of protein and DNA and we carried out the molecular docking, which provided critical basis for the subsequent experiments. Besides, we constructed the dynamic model of the competitive reaction using differential equations to derivate the rate equation of particular competitive reaction.                     You can see all of our models here .
Demonstrate your work
We demonstrated how our system would work in real world by designing a hardware and developing software. The function of the hardware, software and our project have been strictly tested. This part could also be connected with the principle which you can find in our Demonstrate page , Hardware page and Software page.
Silver Medal
Validated Part
We have designed 18 new BioBrick Parts for our project and designed 9 new BioBrick to improve the Havard 2006, and all of these parts have been submitted to the Registry. We experimentally validated that our most new BioBricks worked as expect. The results can be viewed at Registry page.
The main three BioBricks for this medal are listed here: BBa_K2623021 , BBa_K2623030 and BBa_K2623015 .
For more details about our parts, you can visit our parts page.
Collaborations
Collaborate not only for project suggestions, but also for human practice and helping them as we could. You can click here to see more details.
Human Practices
We conducted several human practice projects around our project and synthetic biology like brochure, interviews, intercollegiate communications and newsletter.                     You can click here to see more details.
Bronze Medal
Registration and Jamboree Attendance
We have finished Register form and will attend the Giant Jamboree this October!
Competition Deliverables
We have meet all deliverables on the Competition Deliverables page.
Attributions
We have created a separated page on our wiki showing the attribution of each aspect clearly. You can click here to see more details.
Characterization
We participated in the InterLab Measurement Study successfully you can see our results, suggestions and feedbacks here .
