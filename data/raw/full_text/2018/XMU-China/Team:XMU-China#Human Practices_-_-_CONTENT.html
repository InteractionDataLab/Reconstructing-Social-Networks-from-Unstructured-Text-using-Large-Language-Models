class="panel-collapse collapse in" role="tabpanel"><DIV class="panel-body"><P> This year team XMU-China developed cell-free systems to detect and treat diseases. Protein detection is unique and significant in biology fields, especially for the detection of protein biomarkers which produced by diseased cells. In order to overcome the deficiencies of traditional detection methods, we have developed an Aptamer Based Cell-free Detection system (ABCD system) of protein. The core of the ABCD system is the specific binding of the aptamer and its target protein. After protein detection, we use outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) to treat the diseased cells. We designed a system that has realized the efficient, customizable production of OMVs, which serves to encapsulate specific siRNA for disease treatment. To guarantee the practicability detection and treatment system, we also improved KaiABC system and TDPs system to regulate the expression rate of OMVs and store fragile chemicals or biological materials.</P><P>
                                            In order to equip our idea with social demands, we have been practicing all through our project by conducting investigation on diseases detection and corresponding information, visiting biotechnology company to gain a better knowledge about the diseases detection, interacting with public to propagate synthetic biology and learning from teams applied themselves in diseases detection theme. We divided these activities in four stages which are Laws and Regulations, Inspiration and Reality, Public and Promotion, Idea and Wisdom, respectively. We have completed Human Practices silver medal criteria, <STRONG>Human Practices gold medal criteria/ Best Integrated Human Practices award and Best Education</STRONG> and <STRONG>Public Engagement award.</STRONG></P><P>In addition，during human practice activities, we found that most disease-diagnosing methods are confined to specific delicate testing apparatus, which are expensive, time-consuming and low sensitivity. The study of Point-of-care testing (POCT), also called bedside testing (with the definition of medical diagnostic testing at or near the time and place of patient care), has become very heated because of its convenience, simplicity and highly efficiency. Internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enables the connection and exchange of data.</P><P>Here we came up with a design. We combined the idea of our project-Aptamer-based Cell-free Detection system (ABCD system), IoT, and the above concept of POCT so as to develop a microfluidic device, which is small while convenient for real-time detection of cancer.

The business plan should involve some basic parts, namely the company's technology introduction, market potential demand, market actual demand, team composition and competitive team analysis. We introduced our project, which joined competition this year, to Mr. Su, and highlighted the hardware products which we independently developed. Mr. Su expressed his expectation for the potential of our hardware equipment in the medical field. But on the other hand, given that starting a new business is tough, Mr. Su believed that our team would encounter five “new” threats in the initial stage, that is, new team, new cooperation partners, new capital, new technologies and new customers.</P><P>He also mentioned that at the initial period of our business, not only the company's internal developing problems, but also the constrictions of the external environment would be the obstacle. Referring to his personal accumulated experience, Mr. Su further gave us some suggestions targeting on starting a new business: considering that China's current intellectual property law system was still imperfect, innovative companies, like ours, who were known for their technological advantages must emphasize the patent-protection. What's more, when our brand was still not so influential compared to those prestigious companies, we should put seeking target customers and broadening sales channels on the front burner, and carefully prevent our technology property right from being infringed. On top of that, he proposed that since our hardware product was based on the &quot;government + grassroots + personal&quot; operation mode, it was necessary to work hard in marketing, with clear targets and strategies.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="panel"><DIV class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="heading115_1_1"><H4 class="panel-title"><A class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapse115_1_1" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse115_1_1">

We found that primary hospitals were mostly able to carry out screening of basic tumor markers such as alpha fetoprotein. If people want to carry out more systematic and specific tumor screening, they had to be referred to higher-level hospitals. In addition, due to the implementation effect of China's medical security system and Xiamen's health policy, the screening of tumor markers at the grassroots-level health center could save about 50% of the cost compared with the large hospitals.

According to the forecast by CBO, the expense of health products will reach up to 4,600 billion in 2020, accounting for 20% of the GDP. Besides, it was shown in the OECD report that in 2011, American people's average expenditure on health care was up to 8233 dollars, twice the expenditure of comparatively developed European countries like French, Switzerland and England. In March, 2010, American president Barack Obama carried out the “Affordable Care Act”, aiming at improving the quality of American health insurance service, and decreasing the cost of health care service. The “ACA Act” established the balance sharing plan, which encouraged doctors and hospitals to meet the patients' medical needs by an integral medical service system through encouraging accountable care organizations. Under that balance sharing plan, suppliers and organizers of the service who meet the standard set by US HHS can serve those who benefits from the medical insurance plan through co-organizing and coordinating. ACO could help reduce the cost and increase the efficiency, and distribute part of the surplus among members. Under the design of the ACO system, the new service supplying mode integrate hospitals, general practitioners, medical specialists and other specialists to answer for the medical quality and medical cost together. <SUP>[2]</SUP></P><P>In America, POCT is supervised by FDA, and is co-organized by certification authority, POCT committee, and POCT coordinators. It exists as one of the branches of IVD. Therefore, it is also supervised under the policies of medical apparatus and instruments. At the same time, IVD products are also supervised under CLIA 88 enacted in 1992, which divided IVD into three registering levels (low, medium and high) basing on the complexity of experiments. Before obtaining the right of market entrance, producers have to make appliances according to CLIA categorizing system.

The whole project about 3 parts, game, Poster and Wish Wall. First, the game part, children play the roles of antibody and antigen respectively, they battled to be the winner by RPS. After the game they all left a deep impression of the general method that our body fight with cancer. Second，Poster，we had some talkative teammates to take charge of this part, so many student from high school and primary school were attracted ,they crowded in front of the poster and listened to our announcers absorbedly. Finally, the Wish Wall part, after our diverse introductions about the synthetic biology, they had learn a lot about it, and some of them even inspire to give their contributions to synthetic biology, and want to attend the innovative, fantastic competition —— iGEM. It's also a cheerful Day for our team to propagate the synthetic biology to so many children.

However, we had no idea about the concrete operations. That was just the reason why we had the meeting with Prof. Zhi Zhu. After listening to the three methods proposed by us, Prof. Zhi Zhu offered personal opinions about them. After taking time restriction and operation feasibility into considerations, we ultimately chose the “competing method” (Figure 1.B) to realize our system. Not only did Prof. Zhi Zhu give us beneficial recommendations, but gave us specific guidance about how to apply the “competing method”. For example, he proposed that we had better use streptavidin magnetic beads as the carriers, and attached biotin on the end position of SYL3C aptamer sequence. </P><P class="Figure_word">Figure 1. Initiative methods to enable ABCD system. A) Method A. B) Method B. C) Method C.</P><P>Therefore, the close combination of streptavidin and biotin could be exploited to fix the aptamer. She also reminded that in order to keep the reactions of competition as far away as possible from the surface of the carriers, TEG could be inserted between biotin and the aptamer sequence. In that case, TEG could serve as a spacer to reduce the effects of reactions on the surface. Suggestions like these, which were offered by our professor were quite a lot. These suggestions enormously facilitated the design of our experiment. On top of that, professor Zhu also listened to our ideas about the the designed model of thermodynamics (See more details in our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:XMU- China/Model#Thermodynamic_model">Modeling page</A>). From her perspective, our ideas were quite acceptable. What more, she pointed out that we could try the “Complementary Trand”, which uses 9nt or even more basic groups, to realize the mutual complement. This suggestion also benefited our experiment and modeling to some extent. Another case worth mentioning is that, when we were encountered with difficulties when using flow cytometry to verify the combination of SYL3C and EpCAM, it was professor Zhu who helped us out of the woods. <STRONG>She suggested us to use another method, fluorescence polarization, to verify the combination of those two molecules <SUP>[2]</SUP>.</STRONG> Her advice turned out to be wise and feasible. Finally, we used that method and successfully verified the combination.

On the one hand, Prof. Xue fully affirmed the innovation and feasibility of this project. On the other hand, Prof. Xue though it that if we could find a more specific biomarker from one cancer like liver cancer, which would strengthen the academic persuasion of our project. We communicated with Prof. Xue about the next clinical trial plan of the detection hardware, and reached a preliminary cooperation agreement. <STRONG>If possible, we could take the instrument to the lab in hospital, and use the patient's blood sample to verify the performance of the instrument, such as stability and sensitivity.</STRONG></P><H1>After the first generation product of Fang completed</H1><P>In order to prove the feasibility of our project, we consulted the Chief Physician Weiwei Tang.

                                            As for Fang, Dr. Tang agreed with our proposals that we are going to make Fang widely used among basic medical institutions, especially in remote and poverty-stricken areas because of its convenient and practicability. But it's worth noting that today there is an authoritative method for disease-diagnose, that is pathological diagnosis. <STRONG>So our detection method would just serve as a kind of screening tool rather than diagnosis method, according to Tang's suggestion. We also should pay attention to the testing sensitivity of our project if it could meet national standards or even better.</STRONG></P><H1>After the first generation of software tool completed</H1><P>In order to improve our software part, we had an enjoyed talk with Mr. Wu about the communication mode between team's hardware and software, especially practicability of software design. Mr. Wu fully affirmed its innovation and praised team's consciousness of social responsibility.

If people want to carry out more systematic and specific tumor screening, they had to be referred to higher-level hospitals. What's more, due to the implementation effect of Chinese medical security system and Xiamen's health policy, the screening of tumor markers at the grassroots-level health center could save about 50% of the cost compared with the large hospitals, which is beneficial for people to have cancer detection on regular. It also met our vision about the social role of our hardware. <STRONG>Therefore, to sum up, president Zhan affirmed the future prospects of our instruments, believing it would solve problems such as &quot;difficult access to medical services&quot; in real life, to better provide more convenient medical and health services.</STRONG></P><H1>Before we design the Business Plan</H1><P><STRONG>In order to learn about startup and operate a company in medical field, we visited Mr. Su.

Given that starting a new business is tough, Mr. Su believed that our team would encounter five “new” threats in the initial stage, that is, new team, new cooperation partners, new capital, new technologies and new customers. Referring to his personal accumulated experience, Mr. Su further gave us some suggestions targeting on starting a new business: considering that China's current intellectual property law system was still imperfect, innovative companies, like ours, who were known for their technological advantages must emphasize the patent-protection. What's more, when our brand was still not so influential compared to those prestigious companies, we should put seeking target customers and broadening sales channels on the front burner, and carefully prevent our technology property right from being infringed. <STRONG>On top of that, he proposed that since our hardware product was based on the &quot;government + grassroots + personal&quot; operation mode, it was necessary to work hard in marketing, with clear targets and strategies.</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="panel"><DIV class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="heading114-2-3"><H4 class="panel-title"><A class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapse114-2-3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse114-2-3">

According to the forecast by CBO, the expense of health products will reach up to 4,600 billion in 2020, accounting for 20% of the GDP. Besides, it was shown in the OECD report that in 2011, American people's average expenditure on health care was up to 8233 dollars, twice the expenditure of comparatively developed European countries like French, Switzerland and England. In March, 2010, American president Barack Obama carried out the “Affordable Care Act”, aiming at improving the quality of American health insurance service, and decreasing the cost of health care service. The “ACA Act” established the balance sharing plan, which encouraged doctors and hospitals to meet the patients' medical needs by an integral medical service system through encouraging accountable care organizations. Under that balance sharing plan, suppliers and organizers of the service who meet the standard set by US HHS can serve those who benefits from the medical insurance plan through co-organizing and coordinating. ACO could help reduce the cost and increase the efficiency, and distribute part of the surplus among members. Under the design of the ACO system, the new service supplying mode integrate hospitals, general practitioners, medical specialists and other specialists to answer for the medical quality and medical cost together. <SUP>[4]</SUP></P><P>In America, POCT is supervised by FDA, and is co-organized by certification authority, POCT committee, and POCT coordinators. It exists as one of the branches of IVD. Therefore, it is also supervised under the policies of medical apparatus and instruments. At the same time, IVD products are also supervised under CLIA 88 enacted in 1992, which divided IVD into three registering levels (low, medium and high) basing on the complexity of experiments. Before obtaining the right of market entrance, producers have to make appliances according to CLIA categorizing system. After that, CMS, DCLD and CDC will check the products and authorize corresponding CLIA certifications.
