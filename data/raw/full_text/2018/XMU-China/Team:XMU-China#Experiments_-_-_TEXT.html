III. Making Electrocompetent Cells Protocol
1) Preferably, select single colony of E. coli from fresh LB plate for inoculating a 10 mL 2XYT overnight (O/N) starter culture. Alternatively, streak out frozen glycerol stock of bacterial cells onto LB plate, grow plate O/N, and then select single colony for starter culture. Grow 10 mL starter culture O/N in 37°C shaker (250 rpm).
2) Inoculate 1L of 2XYT media and place culture in 37°C shaker. Grow cells and measure OD600 every 45 min. When the OD600 equals 0.6-0.9 (log phase growth), remove the cells from the shaker and place on ice.
Note: It is very important to keep the cells at 4°C (or on ice) for the remainder of the procedure.
3) Split the 1 L culture into four equal parts by pouring ~250 mL of culture into each chilled 250mL Corning pointed bottle.
4) Spin (#1) in GPR centrifuge at 4000 rpm, 25 min at 4°C.
(if you chose to use the J6/ JS-4.2 rotor (E. Davidson Lab), use 1L bottles , fill half full, spin 4000rpm, 20min, at 4°C.)
5) Place bottles on ice. Remove supernatant immediately as cell pellet begins to lift off quickly. Gently resuspend each pellet in 200 mL ice-cold dH20.

* Optimized cloning efficiency is 50–100 ng of vectors with 2–3 fold of excess inserts. Use 5 times more of inserts if size is less than 200 bps. Total volume of unpurified PCR fragments in Gibson Assembly reaction should not exceed 20%.
** Control reagents are provided for 5 experiments.
*** If greater numbers of fragments are assembled, additional Gibson Assembly Master Mix may be required.

2) Pre-freezing: put the centrifuge tubes into the refrigerator to freeze at -80 ℃ for 12h.
3) Operate the lyophilizer: start the lyophilizer to allow the chamber temperature to drop to -50℃.
4) Freeze-drying: after pre-freezing of the sample, put it into the lyophilizer. Then sublimation for 24 hours under vacuum condition which called Primary drying; Lastly, increase shelf temperature to about 30 ℃ to desorbe the residual water under vacuum condition.
5) Store the lyophilized sample under low temperature and dry conditions.
