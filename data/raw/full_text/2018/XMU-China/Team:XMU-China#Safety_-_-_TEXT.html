Safe Project Design
Firstly, we use E.coli as our chassis organisms and do not use any other organism. E.coli DH5α, BL21 and BL21(DE3) were the only chassis when we performed the molecular cloning and expression. All the plasmids are harmless for humans and none of our parts would raise any safety issue according to the current expertise. In order to overcome the deficiencies of traditional detection methods, we have developed an Aptamer Based Cell-free Detection system of protein (ABCD system). We used the aptamer SYL3C against EpCAM, an epithelial cell adhesion molecule that is highly expressed on the surface of adenocarcinoma cells. After protein detection, we use outer-membrane vesicles  (OMVs) to treat the diseased cells. For the sake of allowing our detection and treatment system to function in reality, we designed KaiABC system and TDPs system to regulate the expression rate of OMVs and store fragile chemicals or biological materials.
Safe Lab Work
The building of laboratory include the location of emergency exits, emergency ventilation system, fire-fighting equipment, first aid kit and so on. Every year after recruiting new members, we spend a semester training them in basic laboratory operations and handling safety accidents. Laboratory coat and gloves are necessary when entering the laboratory. All culture fluid and culture medium with bacteria were processed properly to prevent the potential biological pollution. We handled all the biological materials, wastes and equipments strictly following the BSL-1 requirements, our lab is also equipped with professional operators of dangerous goods and waste biological products, they will disposal all the waste properly. We turn off the water and electricity, close window and door when we leave the lab.
At the same time, we invited laboratory safety engineer, Wenyao Shao，to join our team as an advisor and to conduct safety education for all team members when they officially entered the experimental phase consistently.
Safety Shipment
We always followed iGEM shipment requirements when sending our DNA parts to the Registry.
