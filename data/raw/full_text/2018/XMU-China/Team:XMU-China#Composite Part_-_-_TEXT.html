Composite Parts
We have designed a series of composite parts this year, and most of them could be useful tools for constructing other OMVs and KaiABC systems. And our favorite composite part is BBa_K2623030 , which links BBa_K2623024 and BBa_K2623025 , coding SpyTag-OmpA and SpyCatcher-L7Ae-RFP to be encapsulated into OMVs through the isopeptide bond formed between SpyTag/SpyCatcher.
