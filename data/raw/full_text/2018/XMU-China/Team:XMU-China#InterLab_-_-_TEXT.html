Introduction
Introduction of cell measurement
The goal of cell measurement of the interlab study is to explore a major question: How close can the numbers be when fluorescence is measured all around the world? So we measured GFP fluorescence in our lab with plate reader (Tecan Infinite® M200 Pro). This year, six devices and one positive control and one negative control were provided by the registry.
After the experiment, eight required devices were created:
Positive control: I20270 in pSB1C3;
Negative control: R0040 in pSB1C3;
Test Device 1: J23101.B0034.E0040.B0010.B0012 in pSB1C3;
Test Device 2: J23106.B0034.E0040.B0010.B0012 in pSB1C3;
Test Device 3: J23117.B0034.E0040.B0010.B0012 in pSB1C3;
Test Device 4: J23100.B0034.E0040.B0010.B0012 in pSB1C3;
Test Device 5: J23104.B0034.E0040.B0010.B0012 in pSB1C3;
Test Device 6: J23116.B0034.E0040.B0010.B0012 in pSB1C3.
Introduction of Colony Forming Units
The goal of this part of interlab study is to calibrate OD600 to colony forming unit (CFU) counts, which are directly relatable to the cell concentration of the culture.
This year, two Positive Control cultures and two Negative Control cultures were provided by the Registry: BBa_I20270 Culture1, BBa_I20270 Culture2, BBa_R0040 Culture1 and BBa_R0040 Culture2. The results show increased number of colonies in the higher cell concentration of each culture.
Experience and discussion
We met some challenges and gained from them during the process of the whole Interlab, and we will make a brief discussion below:
Ⅰ.Part of Cell Measurement
Thanks to the detailed experimental protocols and materials provided to us by the igem office, we have completed our cell measurement department very successfully.
In the meantime, we had mastered molecular cloning experiments, as well as the use of Plate Reader. The only drawback was that we didn't know the expected results of the experiment, and we couldn't make sure that if our data were correct before submitting them to the igem office.
Ⅱ.Part of Flow Cytometry
We were not so sure about the apparatus used in this part when reading the protocols of flow cytometry. Therefore, we used conventional type of flow cytometer, which could only measure and analysize ONE sample at a time. It proved that using the traditional flow cytometer a big mistake because this part not only cost us a lot of time (about 5 hours and more) but also damaged the instrument due to the long-time measurement.
After the deadline of data submission, we knew that what should be used in this part was the flow cytometer of high-throughput type that could read 96-well plates. It was a big regret that we failed to read out this information from the protocols.
Ⅲ.Colony Forming Units
We learned that the OD600 detected by the Plate Reader was actually Absorbance600, so we had to measure the calibration parameter before the formal experiment.
In this experiment, there were many samples need to be diluted, which may spend lots of time, and the bacteria were still growing with the OD value increasing. In addition, plate counting was also a difficult process, because the single colonies that grew on the higher concentration plates grew together. Therefore, we couldn't guarantee the accuracy of the results.
