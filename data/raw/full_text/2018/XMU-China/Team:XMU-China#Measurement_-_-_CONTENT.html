                    Measurement of ABCD System
                </DIV><P>For our ABCD system, there are three parts in our <A class="click_here" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:XMU-China/Design">Design</A>, generally, namely Sensor, Amplifier and Reporter. However, to verify the feasibility of this system, we divided the whole ABCD system into four parts by <STRONG>flexibly</STRONG> utilizing the modular features of <STRONG>Synthetic Biology</STRONG>.</P><H1>Part Ⅰ</H1><P>First of all, the aptamer SYL3C <SUP>[1]</SUP> and its &quot;complementary strand&quot; must form a structure of double-strand, which is the basis of competition (see more details in our <A class="click_here" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:XMU-China/Design#ABCDsystem">Design page</A>). The electrophoretic behavior of ssDNA would be evidently different from that of dsDNA due to their different conformations. <SUP>[2]</SUP> On this basis, we used <STRONG>electrophoresis</STRONG> to prove that the SYL3C-C3 complex indeed formed (Figure 1, see more details in our <A class="click_here" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:XMU-China/Results#ABCDsystem">Results page</A>). The C3 strand is <STRONG>10nt complementary</STRONG> to the SYL3C strand; however, we set controls of C4 strand (<STRONG>9nt complementary</STRONG> to the SYL3C strand) and SYL3C strand, noticing that C4 strand failed to form the complex but C3 strand succeeded, according with our expectations of modeling. (see more details in our <A class="click_here" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:XMU-China/Model#Thermodynamic_model">Modeling page</A> ).</P><P class="Figure_word"><STRONG>Figure 1. </STRONG>The result of electrophoresis.

It is worth mentioning that there are many ways to display these two molecules' binding and their affinity. <SUP>[3]</SUP> We failed to verify the binding by using ultrafiltration and flow cytometry previously, which was a really big obstacle for us during the whole process. Later, following Prof. Zhi Zhu's suggestion, we utilized an approach of <STRONG>fluorescence polarization</STRONG> to prove the binding between SYL3C and EpCAM successfully. According to the principle of fluorescence polarization, the FP value would depend directly on the effective molecular size of the fluorophore at a certain temperature and viscosity of the solution. The FP value of SYL3C-FAM was low at first because it was free in the system, (Figure 2.1) then high due to bind with EpCAM (Figure 2.2, see more details in our <A class="click_here" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:XMU-China/Results#ABCDsystem">Results page</A>).</P><P class="Figure_word"><STRONG>Figure 2.1.</STRONG>  The fluorescence intensity of SYL3C-FAM.

                    </P><P>Interestingly, we just had a <STRONG>fluorescence spectrometer</STRONG> (Figure 3) without related function of fluorescence polarization in our lab. So we added two polarizers from a pair of 3D glasses to the fluorescence spectrometer then completed the measurement from vertical and parallel direction successfully. We had to say it was a good <STRONG>modification</STRONG> of our instrument. </P><P class="Figure_word"><STRONG>Figure 3.</STRONG>  Fluorescence spectrometer (Shimadzu<SUP>®</SUP> RF-6000).</P><P>[Protocols]:<A class="click_here" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:XMU-China/Experiments#Forming_double_strands">  SYL3C binding EpCAM</A></P><H1>Part Ⅲ</H1><P>Subsequently, to prove whether competition was feasible or not, the traditional fluorescence approach was used properly. The C3 strand was modified with a FITC label. If competition succeeded, it could verify that EpCAM squeeze out the C3 from SYL3C-C3 complex, and the fluorescence intensity of supernatant of &quot;adding EpCAM&quot; would show significant difference to that of &quot;without EpCAM&quot; (Figure 4, see more details in our <A class="click_here" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:XMU-China/Results#ABCDsystem">Results page</A> ). Setting the control of &quot;without EpCAM&quot; was essential for us because this control was as a &quot;background&quot; for the tests, especially those in our hardware and practical application in the future. We used a <STRONG>fluorescence spectrometer</STRONG> (Figure 3) to carry out the measuring task.</P><P class="Figure_word"><STRONG>Figure 4.</STRONG>  The result of competition.</P><P>[Protocols]:<A class="click_here" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:XMU-China/Experiments#Competition">  Competition</A></P><H1>Part Ⅳ</H1><P class="Figure_word"><STRONG>Figure 5.</STRONG>  The result of trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a.</P><P>Last but not least, the effectiveness of the amplifier and reporter of ABCD system is also quite essential (see more details in our <A class="click_here" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:XMU-China/Design#ABCDsystem">Design page</A>). A special short ssDNA of 21nt was used to activate the Cas12a protein which had been incubated with the corresponding crRNA in advance to form the RNP complex. After this, we set controls and made distributions by manipulating DNaseAlert<SUP>TM</SUP> Substrate Nuclease Detection System <SUP>[4]</SUP> (provided by IDT<SUP>®</SUP>) to test if the activity of trans-cleavage <SUP>[5-6]</SUP> of Cas12a was activated. Such a method was reported before to check DNase activity of Cas12a. <SUP>[6]</SUP> The <STRONG>microplate reader</STRONG> (Figure 6) was used to measure the fluorescence intensity due to continuous measurement over time, which meant that diverse measurement methods were involved appropriately and reliable in our experiments. A significant trend of increase of fluorescence intensity indicated a satisfying result that the activity was activated evidently (Figure 5, see more details in our <A class="click_here" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:XMU-China/Results#ABCDsystem">Results page</A>). We fitted our results with Gaussian method, furnishing a convincing best incubation time for the instruction of our hardware.</P><P class="Figure_word"><STRONG>Figure 6.</STRONG> Microplate reader (Tecan Infinite<SUP>®</SUP> M200 Pro).</P><P>[Protocols]:<A class="click_here" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:XMU-China/Experiments#Trans-cleavage_activity_of_Cas12a">  Trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a</A></P><H1>Integration</H1><P>We also did the integrated experiment to verify our system. Starting with adding EpCAM, we extracted the supernatant after competition, then utilized this supernatant which contained C3 strand (<STRONG>without</STRONG> a FITC label) squeezed out by the EpCAM to activate Cas12a, whose effect could be checked by DNaseAlert<SUP>TM</SUP> Substrate Nuclease Detection System. The fluorescence intensity was measured by <STRONG>fluorescence spectrometer</STRONG> (Figure 3), just as what we did in <STRONG>Part Ⅳ</STRONG>.

The results demonstrated the EpCAM was active, so we could carry out the following experiments (Figure 8, see more details in our <A class="click_here" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:XMU-China/Results#ABCDsystem">Results page</A>).</P><P class="Figure_word"><STRONG>Figure 7.</STRONG> Flow cytometer (BD FACSVerse<SUP>TM</SUP>).</P><DIV class="table_container"><TABLE class="table"><TBODY><TR><TH>Name</TH><TH>Events</TH><TH>% Parent</TH><TH>% Grandparent</TH><TH>% Total</TH><TH>PE-A Mean</TH><TH>PE-A Geo Mean</TH></TR><TR><TD>ni-beads:P1</TD><TD>5,087</TD><TD>94.52</TD><TD>***</TD><TD>94.52</TD><TD>108</TD><TD>82</TD></TR><TR><TD>ni-beads+antiepcam:P1</TD><TD>5,208</TD><TD>91.45</TD><TD>***</TD><TD>91.45</TD><TD>2,880</TD><TD>2,626</TD></TR><TR><TD>EpCAM+Anti-EpCAM:P1</TD><TD>4,238</TD><TD>93.53</TD><TD>***</TD><TD>93.53</TD><TD>14,816</TD><TD>14,211</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P class="Figure_word"><STRONG>Figure 8.</STRONG>  The result of flow cytometry.</P><P>[Protocols]:<A class="click_here" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:XMU-China/Experiments#Verifying_the_EpCAM's_activity">  Verifying the EpCAM's activity</A></P><P>It seemed too simple to verify whether the trans-cleavage of Cas12a was activated by directly using the DNaseAlert<SUP>TM</SUP> Substrate Nuclease Detection System. It's necessary to verify the system itself feasible to transfer the molecular signals to fluorescent signals. Then, directly exploiting DNase I for verification, we'd like to observe the change in fluorescence intensity in the presence of DNase I at certain time points or not. As we expected, the efficiency of DNase I was so high that the fluorescence intensity almost reached the maximum within 3 min. What's more, the results of two groups distinguished from each other significantly (Figure 9, see more details in our <A class="click_here" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:XMU-China/Results#ABCDsystem">Results page</A>).

We've also done lots of experiments by attempting <STRONG>variable methods</STRONG> to verify each part (no matter succeeded or failed), especially the <STRONG>Part Ⅰ</STRONG> and <STRONG>Part Ⅱ</STRONG>. We carefully modified our protocols for the sake of making it useful and universal for different teams and their projects.
