PI
Baishan Fang
Dr. Fang is a distinguished professor in College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, and he is also the director of the Institution of Biochemical Engineering of Xiamen University. His research mainly focuses on synthetic biology, mining and the transformation of enzyme, construction of bio-molecular machines. He has been our PI since 2010 and his advice and equipment support are also helpful this year as ever.
Keju Jing
Dr. Jing is an associate professor in the Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, his research mainly focuses on amino acid dehydrogenase-catalyzed synthesis of chiral amino acids and directed evolution of glucose dehydrogenase and application of biomimetic cofactor. This is his second year participating in iGEM and working as our PI. Thanks to his suggestions and supports in theory and laboratory, we can work on our project much easier.
Student Leaders
Don't sleep, live on your nerves, never say no.
Live well, love lots, and laugh often.
Members
Treading water is the same as drowning.
——《House of Cards》
Don't focus on the stupid photo. It's someone else, not me.
Do one thing at a time, and do well.
The higher I got, the more amazed I was by the view.
I will keep up and never give up.
The reason why a great man is great is that he resolves to be a great man.
I must block the destiny the throat!
The world doesn't revolve around you!
When you are suffering, that is when you are the most real!
-《Western world》
Sow nothing, reap nothing.
A merry heart goes all the way.
Don't learn biology, choose computer science instead.
Keep on going never give up.
All tragedies, in the world, are caused by the incapability of the parties.
Wasting time is robbing oneself.
Instructor
It is his third year participating in iGEM. With patience, tolerance and intelligence, he can solve any problem.
Never put off what you can do today until tomorrow.
Only they who fulfill their duties in everyday matters will fulfill them on great occasions.
Live beautifully, dream passionately, love completely.
Advisors
The greatest test of courage on earth is to bear defeat without losing heart.
The only way to fight against setbacks is to improve yourself and do as much work as you can without hesitation.
All things in their being are good for something.
Science and technology lead the future！
Failure is the mother of success.
Adversity is the midwife of genius.
Victory belongs to the most persevering.
While there is life there is hope.
For better, for worse.
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope.
Other men live to eat, while I eat to live.
A thousand-li journey is started by taking the first step.
That which is below is like that which is above, and that which is above is like that which is below, to do the miracles of one only thing.
—Hermes Trismegistus《Emerald Tablet》
A strong man will struggle with the storms of fate.
Man struggles upwards; water flows downwards.
Man errs as long as he strives.
Victory won‘t come to me unless I go to it.
Energy and persistence conquer all things.
