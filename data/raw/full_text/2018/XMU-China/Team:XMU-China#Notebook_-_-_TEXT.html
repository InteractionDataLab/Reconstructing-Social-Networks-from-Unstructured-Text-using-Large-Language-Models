- Our team was formally founded.
- All student members learned the fundamental knowledge of molecular cloning and iGEM.
- All student members looked through the previous excellent projects and learned the basic notion of synthetic biology and iGEM.
Apr
- We were divided into four groups and started to brainstorm separately (and we reported each’s progress every weekend).
- Our team was formally accepted by iGEM.
May
- Our formal project was confirmed.
- The pre-experiment plan was confirmed.
- The division of labor was confirmed.
