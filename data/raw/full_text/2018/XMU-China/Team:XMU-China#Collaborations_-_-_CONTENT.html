From our professional perspective, we gave some advice on cell signaling pathways and cell-cell interactions, and recommended several related articles to them, hoping to help them. Based on our project, they raised some questions about whether our cell-free system belongs to the field of synthetic biology. We put forward our views, and the two parties had a futher discussion. We believe that synthetic biology is not a simple use of biobrick to construct gene loops. Instead, it should be a broader definition. We think that standard components are like building blocks, but it is up to people to decide what items should be joint together, rather than building blocks themselves. Therefore, biobrick can be used to build systems outside the genetic loop.</P><P>In addition, both of us exchanged ideas on the Art&amp;Design. We carried out visual design communications with SUStech on aspects involving poster, Wiki and PPT.

We have had a two-hour telephone conversation with them. On the phone, we exchanged the purpose of the project and some detailed designs, introduced our own project to them and proposed some questions for each other.</P><P>Secondly, we asked the BIT team about a difficulty in the experimental program.

                                            On July 31, 2018, at the 6<SUP>th</SUP> Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference hosted by National Chung Hsing University, Taichung，we met with NAU-CHINA team and established a deep friendship. Since then, our two teams have exchanged and discussed &quot;how to build a team.&quot; </P><P>The professor affirmed the feasibility of our project and gave us some invaluable advice. Under the suggestion of Professor Zhu Zhi, we chose EpCAM and aptamer SYL3C. In addition, we are very grateful to Professor Zhu for her support on many instruments and materials provided during our experiments.</P><P>First we discussed &quot;what kind of team should we build?&quot; The International Genetic Engineering Machine Competition is a creative synthetic biology event and an interdisciplinary competition involving cross-disciplinary fields in mathematics, computers, statistics and so on. So our team should be a creative, comprehensive synthetic biology team. Our team members should be creative and comprehensive students. Most students of our two teams have multiple roles in the team.</P><P>Second, we discussed &quot;how to find new partners.&quot; After we know what kind of team we want to build, we could find the companions we need. First, we have presentations, exhibitions, lab activities, etc. to make students realize that, what kind of the team they will join in and what is the team building for? what role they will be in the team, and what should be done by themselves? In order to join this team and make this team better, how should them prepare and learn? Then we divide the interviewers into different groups according to different division of labor and their wishes. Different groups determine the way of assessment according to the division of labor. For example, the number module is tested by some models, and the art team performs preliminary selection through some art production tasks... We will give priority to students with multiple skills.</P><P>Third, we communicated on how to train the new team members in the early stages of team formation. First of all, we will introduce our team and International Genetic Engineering Machine Competition through presentations, posters, WeChat pushes, etc., and also convey our requests for new recruits. We will then train the interviewees in groups and we will select them during the training process. Our training is mainly to share the learning materials for students and let them learn by themselves.</P><P>Our two teams made recommendations on each other for training new members. They suggested us add a literature reading part to the training to teach students how to read literatures and how to extract important information from the literature. Then they shared with us some materials for teaching students to read the literature. Their advice has helped us a lot, and we plan to adopt their suggestions to improve this year's training. At the same time, we also suggest that they increase the opportunities for students to practice, let the students design their own topics, increase their free space, make them more creative and have more new ideas. In addition, we exchanged our training materials on modeling, hardware, software, art and web design with each other.</P><P>Finally, we communicated with the daily management of the team. At the beginning of each team, all the students will participate in the design of the project and conduct laboratory training. After the preliminary determination of the subject, the students were divided into different groups, responsible for different labors like experiments, modeling, human practice and so on. We hold group meetings every week, each group reports the progress of the project, and different groups communicate with each other. In addition, we will also hold regular entertainment activities such as picnics, parties, etc. to relax and enhance team friendship. Both of our teams have one thing in common. Most members are in multiple roles, which better strengthens the communication between groups. It shows that iGEM competition is a common combination. There are different groups in this team. Everyone is not working separately, but is always intimately connected.</P><P>Through the exchanges with the NAU-iGEM team, Our team has a better construction model, and we have more experience in the follow-up training this year. Thanks to the NAU team for their help.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="panel"><DIV class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="heading115_22"><H4 class="panel-title"><A class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapse115_22" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse115_22">

In addition, we also assisted H14Z1_hangzhou to complete the design of the first level menu and the second level menu in the navigation bar, so that their results can be better displayed in front of the judges. </P><P>Second, XMU-China and H14Z1_hangzhou assumed the task of the experimental representation each other. H14Z1_hangzhou helped XMU-China measure the fluorescence characterization data of BBa_K2623025. XMU-China helped H14Z1_hangzhou complete the experimental curve of the number of engineering bacteria in the process of fermenting yoghurt with the change of time.</P><P>The experimental steps and results are as following:</P><P>Experimental steps: </P><P>1. The first day, Lactobacillus NZ9000 and GMCA respectively were inoculated into 50ml GM17 medium, fermented at 30 ℃ overnight (about 12h). (Place them in a 30 ℃ incubator, no shaker shocks required). </P><P>2. Next day, fresh milk was heated to about 55-60 degrees Celsius, and then adding some white sugar, 3000rpm stirring for 10 minutes mixing. Divided them into 250ml shaker, and the volume of liquid in every shaker is 100ml. </P><P>3. Sterilize the above solution at 90 ℃ for 5min, then cool it to 30 degrees Celsius to prepare for inoculation and fermentation. Then collect Lactobacillus acidophilus in shaker and clean them 1 times with sterile water. Add Lactobacillus acidophilus to the sample making the initial OD is 0.1 (600nm). Then let them ferment statically in the 250ml shaker at 30 ℃ (Place them in the 30 ℃ incubator, without shaker vibration) </P><P>4. Measure the OD value every two hours and count the corresponding number of cells to draw the curve.

Based on the topic of ideas, gene circuit design, experimental programs and practical application level, XMU-China put forward their own ideas, which helped FJNU-China better prepare for the competition and explain the ideas of their subject. After the meeting, we introduced them to the hospital's dermatologist and led them to visit the Xiamen Environmental Protection Bureau.</P><P>At the end of the competition, XMU-China provided years of experience to help FJNU-China to complete the safety form and judging form.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="panel"><DIV class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="heading113_1"><H4 class="panel-title"><A class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapse113_1" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapse113_1">

Finally inspired by 2017 TU_Delft's TDPs project and improving the characterization method. But it costed a lot of our time and efforts. After communicating with the team SYSU_Software in September, we asked them to quickly and accurately search for the previous project. They upgraded the functions of their software to cater our needs. We compared the information obtained by the manual search and the information obtained through the software search, and found that the software can be well positioned to the part of the experimental plan we need, which is equivalent to the accuracy of the manual search, but the work efficiency is improved and the work efficiency is lowered. After obtaining the results, we made recommendations on the user-friendliness of the software's user interface operations and the search algorithms can be optimized later.
