Composite Parts
This year we have designed more than 20 parts, half are basic parts, the other are composite ones. The parts are all designed by ourselves and most of them have been tested to insure their reliability. To see their specific function, you can click here to learn about our project, or browse the specific page on parts.igem.org by clicking on the part numbers.
Basic Parts
This year we have designed eleven basic parts mostly from TDP protein systems and Kai ABC systems. BBa_K2623008 is our favorite basic part, which is the core part of the TDP circuit. This part contains the coding region of the Hypsibius dujardini (Water bear) (Macrobiotus dujardini) CAHS gene. Cytosolic abundant heat soluble proteins acts as a molecular shield in water-deficient condition. Tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) are essential for desiccation tolerance by forming non-crystalline amorphous solids upon desiccation, and this vitrified state mirrors their protective capabilities.

Composite Parts
We have designed a series of composite parts this year, and most of them could be useful tools for constructing other OMVs and KaiABC systems. And our favorite composite part is BBa_K2623030 , which links BBa_K2623024 and BBa_K2623025 , coding SpyTag-OmpA and SpyCatcher-L7Ae-RFP to be encapsulated into OMVs through the isopeptide bond formed between SpyTag/SpyCatcher.
