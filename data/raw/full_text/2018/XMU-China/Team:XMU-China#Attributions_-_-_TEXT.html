Team training
Our university don't have an iGEM or synthetic biology course. We learnt the knowledge from the textbooks and iGEM official website.
Guided by advisor: Yuan Cheng, Chen Kainan, Xuejie Zhang, Wenyao Shao and student leader: Yang Liang, Yulong Han.
Supported by PI: Baishan Fang and Keju Jing.
Acknowledgement
We would like to thank our instructors Baishan Fang and Keju Jing for providing us laboratory, material and instruments. We also want to thank Sangon BioTech, Shanghai for primer synthesis and DNA sequencing, and thank IDT for their free gene synthesis.
