Basic Parts
This year we have designed eleven basic parts mostly from TDP protein systems and Kai ABC systems. BBa_K2623008 is our favorite basic part, which is the core part of the TDP circuit. This part contains the coding region of the Hypsibius dujardini (Water bear) (Macrobiotus dujardini) CAHS gene. Cytosolic abundant heat soluble proteins acts as a molecular shield in water-deficient condition. Tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) are essential for desiccation tolerance by forming non-crystalline amorphous solids upon desiccation, and this vitrified state mirrors their protective capabilities.
