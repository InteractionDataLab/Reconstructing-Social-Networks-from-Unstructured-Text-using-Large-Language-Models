Introduction:
We took part in the iGEM Interlab Study where we worked with 6 different RBS to establish a protocol for GFP measurement in a plate reader.
Materials:
Plate reader:
TECAN GENios Pro
Plate reader Plates:
96 well black plates with clear flat bottom (Greiner)
Cell culture shaker:
INFORS HT MULTITRON
Devices:
Table 1: Test Devices of the Kit Plate
Microorganism:
E. coli K-12 DH5-alpha
Calibration material:
LUDOX CL-X
Silica Beads - microsphere
Methods:
We followed the protocol provided by iGEM HQ.
Comments:
We got the E. coli K-12 DH5-alpha from the Vienna iGEM Team (BOKU-Vienna)
We got the Chloramphenicol (in powderform) for the Interlab Study from the Munich iGEM Team.
We also took part at the Flow cytometrie and uploaded all the data to the dropbox
Plate reader configuration:
Gain: 600
Number of flashes per well (absorbance): 10
Number of flashes per well (fluorescence): 45
Temperature: 25Â°C
Emission wavelength: 535nm
Bandpass width: 25nm
Excitation wavelength: 485nm
Fluorescence reading: top optics
