November
start of brainstorming sessions to find the project we wanted to realize
first deliberations about funding of the project
first contacts about lab and office space
December
team members with already assigned tasks left the team because of university obligations or personal reasons, sizing us down to 6 people from previously 18
still ongoing project finding
January
asking people in the respective fields about the viability of our collected project ideas
deciding on the palm kernel oil project since it is such a huge discussion point in austria

creation of a budget plan (Anna, Marlene)
presentation of our project idea to the deanery of the universities TU-Graz and KFU-Graz

search for a lab space for the preliminary tests (Thomas)
extensive change to the project design (esterification)
gain of 3 new members raising our number to 9

Movie night with following presentation of our project at the university (Anna, Marlene, Marco, Henrik, Veronika, Thomas)
April
improved budget plan
planing of the new preliminary tests and laboratory allocation (Marco, Dominik, Thomas)
igem-graz.at was created and set (Jakob)
13.4.2018
lange nacht der forschung - information evening for visitors of the universities or research facilities
28.4.2018
Teambuilding evening - the team got together for a game of escape the room
May

contacting  a lot of companies for possible cooperations (Anna, Marlene, Veronika, Birgit)
8.6.2018
Teambuilding evening
16.6.2018
TU-Graz StreeTech - public outreach event in front of the city hall Graz to present all student competition teams and projects of the TU Graz including the iGEM teams NAWI_Graz 2017 and 2018 (Anna, Marlene, Henrik, Veronika, Thomas)
26.6.2018
BHAK Weiz - public outreach in form of a presentation and small DNA extraction experiments in a public school to gain more attention for our field of study and iGEM itself (Anna, Marlene, Veronika)
July
creation of the polycistronic expression cassette in snapgene, to be implemented with CRISPR-Cas9 and lambda red recombineering into E. coli K12 MG1655 at the position of the dgkA gene – knocking it out in the    process. The creation took some time since the correct use of snapgene had to be learned and several meetings with professionals from ACIB where needed. They explained to us the correct way to create an expression casette for our    chosen system (two-vector system proposed by Jiang et.al. In 2015 ) and the most common errors that could occur. (Thomas, Dominik)
