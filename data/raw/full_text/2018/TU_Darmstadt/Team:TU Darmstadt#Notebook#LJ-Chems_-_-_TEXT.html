June
Week 1 (28th of May – 3rd of June)
- destillation and Schlenk apparatus were built up
- toluol was dried under argon atmosphere (destillation)
- DCM was dried using a molecular sieve
Week 2 (4th of June – 10th of June)
- stock solutions of initiator Lanthane-III-Isoproxide and of the lactide monomer were generated and filled into flasks under argon atmosphere
Week 3 (11th of June – 17th of June)
- glycolic acid stock solution was generated and stored at – 20 °C
- anionic-ring opening polymerisation of PLGA (ratio 1:1), purification of the product through recrystallization in methanole, desiccation in dry box under vacuum
July
Week 4 (25th of June – 1st of July)
- determination of yield (produced polymer from week 11.06.-15.06.)
- anionic-ring opening polymerization with doubled initiator concentration
- NMR analysis of produced polymer
Week 5 (2nd of July – 8th of July)
- toluol was dried under argon atmosphere (destillation)
- new polymerization technique: polymerization directly out of the melt of the monomers, using tin(II)ethylene-hexanoate (ratio 1:3 glycolid acid, lactide)
Week 6 (9th of July – 15th of July)
- GPC sample preparation
- GPC analysis
Week 7 (23rd of July – 29th of July)

August
Week 8 (30th of July – 5th of August)
- nanosphere synthesis with self-produced polymer, analysis of nanospheres with light microscope
