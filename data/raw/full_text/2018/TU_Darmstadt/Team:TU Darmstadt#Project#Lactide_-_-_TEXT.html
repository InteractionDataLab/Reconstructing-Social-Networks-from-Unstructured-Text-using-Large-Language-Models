The Lactid acid
noch nicht korrigiert
In our project we manufactured co-polymers of the PLA (Poly-lactic-acid) and edited microbes genetically to produce the monomers Glycolic acid and E-Caprolactones. The monomer with the biggest mole fraction in these blends is Lactic acid, which we did not produce in an organism by our self, because the iGEM-Team Evry already did it successfully in 2016 in Pseudomonas putida. The parts they used and other details are listed on their page https://2016.igem.org/Team:Evry .
Basing on their results we saved our manpower and our resources and focused both on the production of Glycolic acid and E-Caprolactone, and the production of the PLA co-polymers.
