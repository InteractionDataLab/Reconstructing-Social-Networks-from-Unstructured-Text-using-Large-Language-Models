We were able to overexpress the genes <I>aceA</I> and <I>ycdW</I> in <I>Escherichia coli</I>. The proteins AceA and YcdW were His-tagged and purified via an ÄKTA system. The purification was confirmed by an SDS-PAGE and a western blot. After that, we successfully characterized YcdW with an NADPH dependent enzyme assay. The assay indicated, that YcdW uses glyoxylate as substrate under consumption of NADPH to produce glycolic acid. The functionality of AceA was verified with a phenylhydrazine-dependent assay. AceA catalyzes the reaction from isocitrate to glyoxylate. The enzyme assays were performed a second time over a longer incubation period and analyzed via HPLC. The expected products of the reactions were found, indicating a catalytic activity of the purified enzymes. When the enzyme YcdW was produced in <I>E. coli</I>, the formation of glycolic acid was observed in the disrupted cells (Figure 1). The combined evidence shows that the transformation of <I>E. coli</I> was successful, leading to the production of functional enzymes. These enzymes then partake in the production pathway of glycolic acid, which was shown <I>in vivo</I>, as well as <I>in vitro</I>. Thus, we could successfully show the production of the first monomer for our biopolymer.

We were successful in the heterologous production of <I>At</I>GLYR1 in <I>S. cerevisiae</I>. This was shown by western blot analysis, as well as during an enzyme assay. Using a NADPH dependent enzyme assay, we could proof the functionality of our purified enzyme (Figure 2). During the assay, <I>At</I>GLYR1 converts glyoxylate to glycolic acid, while turning over NADPH. Therefore, we were able to produce glycolic acid <I>in vitro</I>. Furthermore, we were able to delete several genes from the genome of CEN.PK-1C. This could be helpful to increase the production of glycolic acid <I>in vivo</I>.

To generate this monomer, we successfully overexpressed the genes for heterologous enzymes ADH and CHMO in <I>E. coli</I>. We were able to purify these enzymes using a His-tag. The purified enzymes were detected via SDS-PAGE and western blot. ADH produces NADPH while converting cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone, while CHMO uses NADPH, converting cyclohexanone to ε-caprolactone. An NADPH dependent assay was used to determine the activity of the enzymes separately, as well as in a combined assay (Figure 3 and 4).

We were also able to manually produce nanospheres out of these polymers, thereby showing the feasibility of our potential application scenario.</P><P>
