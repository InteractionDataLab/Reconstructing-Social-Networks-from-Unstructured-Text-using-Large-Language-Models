Dependence on petrochemicals derived from oil and gas poses a major problem in the plastics industry and polymer production. Establishing biological precursors for high quality polymers is a hurdle we want to tackle.
We were driven by the idea of constructing an eco-friendly polymer usable for human medical applications. During our research, we stumbled upon PLGA (Poly(lactic-co-glycolic-acid)) and PLGC (Poly(lactide-co-glycolide-co-caprolactone)). In our case, they consist of renewable resources (glycolic acid, Îµ-caprolactone and lactic acid) and degrade after a controllable period of time into non-toxic compounds, which pose no further danger to the environment, as well as the human body.
