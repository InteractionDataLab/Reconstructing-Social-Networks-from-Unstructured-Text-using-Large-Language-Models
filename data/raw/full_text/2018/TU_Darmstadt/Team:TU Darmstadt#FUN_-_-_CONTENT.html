This page cannot be found in our menu bar and if you found it, please tell no one you did or even how.
So, let's play a little game, if you found all of our Easter Eggs in this wiki, come to us at the Giant Jamboree and tell us how many there are. When your answer is right you will get a small surprise. 
Additionally, on this page we show pictures of our iGEM year 2018 and of all the fun we had.
</P><P>This year’s iGEM team of TU Darmstadt is shaped by an intense team spirit. Learning about SynBio was always the central point of our team. During our time in the lab, everyone learned to be patient with microorganisms and different biological methods. No matter, how precise the preparations for an experiment have been, all kind of mistakes happened. One of our most stupid mistakes resulted in an award instead of punishment. 
For this some examples are given: 
Person 1: why stands this bottle on the table with an open lid? 
Person 2: It´s the liquid waste. 
Person 1: Nope, that is LB-media
Person 2: ohhhh…. ♯sterilworkisourprofession
</P><P>Or
</P><P>Application of pressure to the chemical apparatus where a plug was not secured. The result was a flying plug in the fume cupboard
</P><P>Or
</P><P>Preparation of fresh LB media, but it was not autoclaved on that day. Therefore, we had a really nice and cloudy culture. 
</P><P>Over the year, we found several new, very interesting, team members. Check out this one:

And this is our new fluffy friend who we asked the way during our wine hiking tour.

The group feeling was enhanced by different occasions such as a trip to Austria, team member´s birthday parties and game nights with never ending werewolf sessions. Even broken tabletops, a long car ride with stressed drivers and passengers having a broken foot couldn´t stop our vibe. Just too fast rollercoaster rides decreased the optimistic faces of some passengers. 
We even taught the chemists how to biology. 
</P><P>The chemists fit in really well! 
Who said a summer toboggan run would be fun?! </P><P>As part of the Human Practices, we participated at the “Hessentag” and supported our state Hessen in presenting funded biological research projects. As always, our main goal was, to spread the fun about biology. 
Spread the style to the public. </P><P>
And then there were the times, we went to mingle with other iGEMers at meetups. We sure had lots of fun meeting everyone, seeing their projects and talking synthetic biology. However, some of us might have gotten teams mixed up. This is was when one of our members seemed to believe, he belonged to Munich. 

Some of us just can't let iGEM go and see their lab group everywhere they go. Might be a sign of real love!

Usual night out at iGEM TU Darmstadt.
Inside every guy a little boy is hidden. 
Team leaders at work (even the calendar helps)!
And of course, helpful as always, planning lab work for the groups.
We had such a hot summer this year and still worked in the lab every day. In fact, it was so hot outside that some of us started going a bit crazy.
We also want to introduce the best employee of the year &amp; our hearts; 
Learning what the do's and don'ts of the lab are, can take some time. Some of us had to wait outside, because they didn't have the right footwear.
Even on vacation iGEM never sleeps. Be aware!
Games nights after our team meetings quickly became a given! Here's what a session of Werwolf with iGEM TUDA looks like. 
Best friends share their lives, and yogurt!
iGEM TUDA cooks and iGEM TUDA rocks.
Wiki Freeze was really tiring and stressful. On top of that, we believed it to be a good idea to have fotoshoot day during it was well. This is how this turned endeavor turned out. </P><CENTER>All in all, we had an amazing year, filled with lots of fun times!</CENTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
