Our iGEM year would not have been a success without the generous support you have provided us throughout. Only with your support we are able to participate in the iGEM competition and develop individually and as a team, every year anew.
We deeply appreciate you supporting us, and we sincerely hope that this association will be maintained and you will continue your support in the years to come.
