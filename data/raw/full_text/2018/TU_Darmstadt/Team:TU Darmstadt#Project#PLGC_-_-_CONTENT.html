PLGC is also synthesized via an anionic ring‑opening polymerization<SUP id="cite_ref-Yixiu_1-0" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-Yixiu-1">[1]</A></SUP>. Both the mechanism and the problems during the synthesis of both polymers are identical. Contrary to that, the mechanical characteristics, which are explained in the <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/Project/Background">background</A>, and the degradation behavior, differ a lot. The degradation behavior is an important polymer characteristic for all applications of PLGA and PLGC. Therefore, we will focus on the structural differences, which lead to different characteristics. 
To analyze the synthesized PLGC, we used, similar to PLGA, GPC and NMR‑spectroscopy. After this, we used our purified polymer to manufacture PLGC nanospheres. 
</P><DIV class="caption"><P><B>Figure 1:</B> Structure of PLGC
</P></DIV><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Synthesis_of_PLGC">Synthesis of PLGC</SPAN></H3><P>The synthesis of PLGC terpolymers resembles the synthesis of <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/Project/PLGA#Synthesis_of_PLGA">PLGA</A>. Stannous‑octoate and 1‑octadecanol are forming the initiator part, reacting with lactide, glycolide and ε‑caprolactone monomers to form a polymer chain<SUP id="cite_ref-Yixiu_1-1" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-Yixiu-1">[1]</A></SUP>.  
During our time in the laboratory, two set‑ups of PLGC were processed through anionic ring‑opening polymerization. For the synthesis, the monomers were put in a water free reaction vessel, melted and reacted with the initiators. The method is described in detail in the method book. 
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Degradation_of_PLGC">Degradation of PLGC</SPAN></H3><P>Triggered by the usage of ε‑caprolactone, two competing effects occur. As described in the <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/Project/Background">background</A>, PLGC mostly exists in its rubbery state, because of its low glass temperature (Tg)<SUP id="cite_ref-Yixiu_1-2" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-Yixiu-1">[1]</A></SUP>. Due to that, the ε‑caprolactone makes the polymer chain more flexible, allowing water molecules to diffuse more easily to the ester bonds in those chains, hydrolyzing them. On the other hand ε‑caprolactone lowers the polarity of the chains making them less hydrophilic. Due to this, the water molecules are hindered to come near the ester bonds to hydrolyze them<SUP id="cite_ref-Park_2-0" class="reference"><A href="#cite_note-Park-2">[2]</A></SUP>. 
</P><P>By containing a small mole fraction of the ε‑caprolactone in the chain, the degradation of PLGC proceeds faster than the degradation of PLGA. However, with the mole fraction of ε‑caprolactone increasing, the polymer becomes more and more non‑polar. This causes the degradation time to increase compared to the degradation time of PLGA.

Therefore, equation 1 from the PLGA page was used. Table 1 contains the resulting values.

For the PLGC (II) (ratio 46 %/44 %/10 %) the GPC result shows a molecular weight of 6,818 g/mol, while its expected molecular weight was determined to be 2.16*10<SUP>6</SUP> g/mol, which means that oligomers were produced instead of polymers. 
</P><DIV class="caption"><P><B>Figure 2:</B> GPC of PLGC (I). 
</P></DIV><P>Similar to the PLGA results, the chains are shorter, because of the insufficient magnetic stirring device. The mixture is not stirred well enough at higher viscosity, so the growth of chains is affected while the mixture solidifies. As in the case of PLGA, this can be avoided by a more sufficient stirring mechanism. 
</P><P>But this effect does not completely explain why the molecular weight of PLGC (II) is so low compared to the expected weight. It seemed to be problematic to shut down the reaction and restart it after a pause. The end of the chains seemed not to be reactivated, so the chain growth stopped during the pause. This leaves the conclusion, that an anionic polymerization can not be reactivated after it was shut down once.
</P><P>A sufficient stirring device could not be implementated in our laboratory set up without losing the condition of a waterfree environment. Furthermore, the reactions must not be shut down, before they are completed, to guarantee the production of polymer.
</P><P>
For PLGC (I) we purified 100 % of our product and calculated the yield  as shown in table 1. Since PLGC (II) was further used for nanosphere synthesis, the actual total yield could not be determined. Therefore, the yield of PLGC (II) is a lot lower than for PLGC (I). 
</P><P>The added ε‑caprolactone does not cause a change in viscosity in the reaction mixture. Since PLGC synthesis is the same as PLGA synthesis, the same problems occur. Yields tend to be low, as well.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="NMR-spectroscopy">NMR-spectroscopy</SPAN></H4><P>1H‑NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the monomer ratio. The CH‑group of lactide was normalized to 1. As signals of ε‑caprolactone overlap with the ones from lactide and glycolide, a 2D-NMR spectrum was recorded. In our case, we recorded a COSY spectrum, which shows the interactions of H‑atoms with a distance of three bonds to each other which allows a better differentiation between the individual protons of the molecules. The signals of α‑ and ε‑methylene groups can be distinguished clearly, since their proximity to the oxygen atoms deshields the ε‑methylene groups  the strongest. Therefore, the ε‑methylene signal shows a shift of δ=3.66‑3.73 ppm. This signal is also used for the calculation of the monomer´s ratio. For lactide we used the methyl protons with a shift of δ=1.44‑1.69 ppm, and for glycolide the methylene protons with a shift of δ=4.69‑4.93 ppm. All peaks are shown in the following NMR‑spectrum (Figure 3).

In PLGC (II) the relative amount of ε‑caprolactone monomer was decreased by 74 %, compared to the initial relative amount of free ε‑caprolactone. 
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Outlook">Outlook</SPAN></H3><P>PLGA and PLGC were produced using an insufficient magnetic stirring mechanism, which was not able to stir the reaction mixture at higher viscosity up to the end of the reaction. That led to a low conversion, which makes the results hardly reproducible. To avoid that, the reaction vessel needs to be designed in a way, which provides a continuous stirring all time throughout the reaction. To improve the reproducibility a higher performance stirring mechanism like mechanical stirring combined with a sufficient vacuum and protective gas atmosphereneeds to be incorporated into synthesis device. Those conditions are not achievable with the laboratory equipment, which we can afford. With both conditions given, we would be able to get better reproducible results and more constant chain lengths. With polymers produced this way we would be also able to add additives and produce for example composite materials out of them.
