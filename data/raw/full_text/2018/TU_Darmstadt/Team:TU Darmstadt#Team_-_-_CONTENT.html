As we have a great variety of backgrounds due to our members, our project represents this diversity. Moreover, our team consists of undergrads and grad-students, so the older team members taught the youngsters in the laboratory, as well as in the writing of scientific texts. In addition, workshops were organized by the project monitoring, covering topics like project management and presentation trainings. We happily observe an improvement of every single team member within the project in both hard and soft skills. 
</P><P>Moreover, we all experienced that work is more fun, and thereby more efficient if you have a friendship with your colleagues. These friendships formed due to many group activities, like going to the meet-ups, having long game nights and relaxing a weekend in the alps while hiking. 
</P><P>To sum up, our group consists of diverse members, forming one iGEM team TU Darmstadt, with one idea resulting in one project and afterwards with one shared memory of the iGEM year.

Every year it is a pleasure getting to know a freshly formed team. I particularly enjoy and cherish our often high degree of interdisciplinarity, which always leads to a great increase in knowledge for all participants, myself included! I hope we will have a great time as always, and nice results would be awesome, too! 
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="team-member"><DIV class="text"><P class="name">Marietheres Kleuter</P><P class="sosumi">23 | M. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering | Semester: 2</P><P>Two years ago, I joined the iGEM team as a laboratory worker. This time, I am one of the project monitors. I focus on the aspects of coordination, communication and presentation. As I am convinced, that iGEMers learn much more than “just” the lab work, we (Thea and I) support our team member´s with different seminars about the mentioned topics. I believe that my work as a coach in communication and as a project attendant in different student projects at the TU Darmstadt helps me, to gather a great team spirit with a fun and successful closing in Boston. <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="//2018.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/FUN">♙</A></P></DIV></DIV><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Student_Leaders">Student Leaders</SPAN></H3><DIV class="caption"><P><B>Group picture of our &quot;Student Leaders&quot; team</B>From left to right: Lara Steinel, Jennifer Zimmermann and Bea Marie Spiekermann

difficulties have on the personal development.
In 2018, I hope to see the new team members gaining experiences, such as I did last year, and let my own experiences be beneficial for this year's project. Being part of the team coordination means organizing the work flow and offering new experiences. As part of a project, arranged by students for students, I wish to encourage others in finding their own scientific spirit.
I am looking forward to working together as a team, therefore citing Stephen Hawking: &quot;Life would be tragic if it weren't funny.&quot;.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="team-member"><DIV class="text"><P class="name">Jennifer Zimmermann</P><P class="sosumi">22 | B. Sc. Biology | Semester: 6</P><P>
I am glad to be able to transmit my experiences from the last year to the new team members as a part of the project coordination this year.
The experiences, which I collected last year, brought me to participate again in iGEM and to facilitate the same for the other students.
In contrast to the last year, I will mainly deal with activities beyond the laboratory and I hope to develop my own abilities concerning planning and organization.
I am sure that we will create an exciting project again with a lot of fun.

This time, however, I won't be working in the lab. My task will be project coordination. I want to pass down my experiences and knowledge from last year to the new team members. Furthermore, I'd like to experience the iGEM competition from an entirely new angle. I am really looking forward to learn new things, grow with this year's team, and master challenges together.

Unlike the basic studying, iGEM enables students to independently work on an own project. This new experience is a great opportunity for seeing and learning what advanced studies might be like. At the same time, iGEM is an unique chance to learn much about synthetic biology. Furthermore, socializing is one of the most important aspects of our project.

The self-chosen topic as well as working without a given, rigid framework
on known ground has been especially tempting.
Furthermore, there is the interchange between degree courses, semesters and
universities.
I hope to gain interesting insights into the self-organization of our team, doing my bit
for a successful project.

Besides having fun in the lab, I learned about one's own limitation and how to challenge those.
This year, I want to challenge new problems and tie up with my skills from last year. Furthermore I want to pass on my experience and gained knowledge from the last year project to the new team members. I am looking forward for the next exciting and successful project.

Excited to have the possibility to use all the theory, the knowledge I gained during my study for an own project with a motivated team.
With all the theory and professors sharing their own projects and suggestions, students might lose the ability to create ideas.
That’s what we do in iGEM, we research on our own for a topic, we coordinate our group, we take responsibility, but we also come to our own decisions.
I think it’s going to be a good experience!

I gained a lot of valuable experience during my first iGEM year, which came in handy while working on my bachelor thesis. 
This year I'm looking forward on extending my knowledge again. A big part of iGEM for me is the fun you have working in a team, getting to know new people, exchanging ideas and discussing recent scientific advances.I also want to pass on the knowledge I gained in the past to people who participate for their first time, hoping iGEM will be equally or even more fun and interesting for them as it was for me.

As a chemist I want to learn as much as I can about the field of synthetic biology while also trying to push forward the interdisciplinary part of this year’s project. I hope to learn a lot of technical skills but I would also like to learn organizatoric skills as well as taking responsibility for me and my team.

I learned unbelievably much in just that short year, I found a lot of new friends and the Giant Jamboree was a great experience! One of the many reasons why I learned so much back then have been the older teammates, which have been part of iGEM in the years before. This year I am, as our lab leader, one of these older teammates and I'm eager to help the new ones on their journey through iGEM.

I am looking forward to the challenge of working independently in a team on a project, in which no one tells us what we have to do and I am curious to see how far we can go.
