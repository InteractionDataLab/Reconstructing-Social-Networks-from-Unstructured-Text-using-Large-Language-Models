Best Composite Part Special Prize
For this award we nominate our part BBa_K2770002 . This part is our favorite, as we were able to show functionality of all relevant steps, and could characterize our part accordingly. Transcription and translation of its encoded gene ycdW was shown by western blot. We could purify His-tagged YcdW using an Äkta, could prove YcdWs function by an in vitro glycolate production assay and were able to show product yield using HPLC. For detailed information please visit the respective pages on our wiki and the registry .
Composite Parts

Below we listed the basic parts we used for correct assembly of the above-mentioned composite parts. Therefore, none of these basic parts have been submitted to the registry by our team. Some of them have previously been designed by other iGEM teams, as indicated in the table . All sequences of parts from previous iGEM teams were taken form the part registry and our assembled composite parts have been synthesized by IDT. ✌
