Our Supervisors
Dr. George Wadhams
Oxford Department of Biochemistry
George's research interests lie in how bacteria sense and integrate environmental information. His group focuses on understanding in a quantitative manner how multiple, homologous pathways operate in individual cells and how the components of these pathways can be used to create synthetic pathways. George has been mentoring Oxford iGEM teams since they were founded in 2014.
Dr. Nicolas Delalez
Oxford Department of Engineering
Nick's research interests include synthetic biology and its biophysics of molecular machines.  Nick is the main person we go to when we are stuck on something in the lab. He can troubleshoot everything from an unsuccessful PCR to a contaminated plate of cells.
Dr. Aivar Sootla
Oxford Department of Engineering
Aivar currently is a postdoctoral research associate in the control group at the Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford. He works on the design of biological circuits in the living organisms using control-theoretic tools.
Prof. Antonis Papachristodoulou
Oxford Department of Engineering
Antonis' research interests include systems and synthetic biology, network systems, aerospace systems and flow control, and convex optimisation. Furthermore, he works on modern control theory, robust stability analysis and design, as well as nonlinear dynamical systems and Lyapunov stability.
Prof. Judy Armitage
Oxford Department of Biochemistry
Judy Armitage is interested in the dynamics of bacterial sensory transduction and the control of bacterial motility. In particular, her research group focuses on the communication between the sensory and adaptation mechanisms of the two pathways as a model for network sensory integration in general.
