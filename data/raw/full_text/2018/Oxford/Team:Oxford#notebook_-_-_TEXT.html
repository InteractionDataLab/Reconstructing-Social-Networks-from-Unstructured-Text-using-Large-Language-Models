Notebook
We used the website 'Benchling' to note down all the experiments we performed in the lab. This made sure a summary of the most recent lab work was easily accessible to all members of the team. We split our lab notebook into two files; one recorded work on "Digestion, SDM, Ligation and Microbiology' and the other was used to note down 'PCR and oePCR' reactions.
