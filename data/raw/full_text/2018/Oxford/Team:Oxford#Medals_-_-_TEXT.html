Validated Part
Add a successfully characterised new part to the BioBrick registry
To enable expression of pTet-controlled constructs in bacterial strains which do not endogenously express TetR, we added the bidirectional pTet promoter, BBa_K2757002, to the registry. More information on the design and characterisation of this part can be found here .
Human Practices
Consider the wider implications of the project
Throughout the project, we took steps to better understand the application, safety, and implementation of our design. In addition to our discussions with medical professionals and IBD patients we hosted a number of outreach events and investigated ethical issues associated with GMO probiotics.

Collaboration
Describe work completed by the team and others
Over the Summer, we worked with a range of iGEM teams from around the world, both inside and outside the lab. A summary of our collaborations can be found here .

Modelling
Construct a meaningful model of the system
As shown here , we created a model of the system in both the time and frequency domain. Our model was integral in highlighting the need for a dual feedback loop to to optimise the response.
Integrated Human Practices
Document how the project was guided by Human Practices
A variety of public surveys, patient interviews, and meetings with researchers helped both to guide further research and to shape our design. A notable contribution was the development of an inducible kill switch system to enhance the safety of our probiotic. More information can be found here .
Part Improvement
Create and characterise a BioBrick part with a functional improvement on an existing BioBrick part.
We decided to redesign the Art-175/DsbA composite, BBa_K1659002 , submitted by the 2015 Oxford iGEM team by linking it with a pTet promoter to create BBa_K2757001 , a functional probiotic kill switch. Read more about it here .
