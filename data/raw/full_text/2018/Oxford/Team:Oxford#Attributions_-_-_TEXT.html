Dr. George Wadhams
Oxford Department of Biochemistry
Dr. Wadhams has been mentoring our team since its formation in January. In addition to providing advice at our weekly lab meetings, he was essential in helping us assess the viability of our initial ideas and later tailoring our final one that became our project.
Dr. Nicolas Delalez
Oxford Department of Engineering
Dr. Delalez advised us on multiple aspects of the project. He has a mysterious ability to troubleshoot all our hurdles in the wet lab: everything from an unsuccessful PCR to a contaminated plate of cells.
Dr. Aivar Sootla
Oxford Department of Engineering
Aivar guided us through features of time domain analysis, including modelling of the individual reaction pathways as well as the body response.
Prof. Antonis Papachristodoulou
Oxford Department of Engineering
Professor Papachristodoulou has been very helpful for introducing us to general areas of ODE-based models and verifying our final model.
Prof. Judy Armitage
Oxford Department of Biochemistry
Professor Judy Armitage was kind enough to let us use her laboratory for our work this Summer.
Dr. Maike Bublitz
Oxford Department of Biochemistry
Professor Maike Bublitz advised on the use of DNA precipitation protocols to increase plasmid concentration for successful transformations. She also kindly provided adenine sulfate dihydrate for use in our riboswitch characterisation studies.
