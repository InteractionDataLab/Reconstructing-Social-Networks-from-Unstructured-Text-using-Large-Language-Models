                        leading cause of death in diabetes mellitus. DN occurs in 20% to 40% of all patients with type 2
                        diabetes mellitus, accounting for approximately 50% of cases in the developed countries.<SUP>[1]</SUP> The
                        costs of care for people with DKD are extraordinarily high. In the Medicare population alone,
                        DKD-related expenditures among this mostly older group were nearly $25 billion in 2011.<SUP>[2]</SUP> In
                        China, the incidence of diabetic nephropathy is also increasing at an alarming rate due to the rapid
                        increase of diabetes prevalence and low awareness rate. As the initial symptoms of chronic
                        nephropathy are very secretive, hypertension, urinary protein, edema and other obvious symptoms have
                        entered the stage of clinical diabetic nephropathy or dominant diabetic nephropathy (overtDN).
                        Furthermore, patients often fail to go to the hospital for examination, so patients with diabetic
                        nephropathy often miss the optimal intervention period. Failure to intervene early can lead to a
                        dramatic deterioration in kidney function and a 90 per cent mortality rate. However, if the renal
                        status of patients can be monitored at any time, the reversion rate can be as high as 70% if
                        intervention is carried out before stage iii of diabetic nephropathy (incipientDN).</P><P>At present, urinary microalbumin (mALB) excretion rate is mainly used to diagnose diabetic
                        nephropathy. Although the detection method is relatively perfect, it has the following
                        disadvantages:</P><OL><LI>The accuracy and specificity of mALB in diagnosing DN are not high, and factors such as urinary
                            tract infection can increase the excretion rate of urinary albumin, leading to misdiagnosis and
                            missed diagnosis.
                        </LI><LI>When mALB is abnormal, DN has progressed to stage iii, and at this time, the patient's GBM
                            thickening and mesangial matrix increase are more obvious, and there are already glomerular
                            nodules and diffuse lesions as well as small artery hyaline changes, and the glomeruli have
                            become dilapidated.
                        </LI></OL><P>Han-Henrik Parving said, &quot;Microalbuminuria may not be as sensitive and specific a predictor of diabetic
                        nephropathy as previously suggested. Other markers of risk for diabetic nephropathy are needed for
                        optimal clinical management.&quot;<SUP>[3]</SUP> Studies have shown that the urine of diabetic nephropathy patients
                        with beta2 microglobulin was abnormal 5 years earlier than that of urinary microalbumin.<SUP>[4]</SUP></P><P>Our social practice survey found that people are much more receptive to urine tests than blood tests.
                        So our project was launched to provide diabetes patients with a home, visual, portable test box for
                        early and early kidney disease using beta2 microglobulin as a marker.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><H2 class="title">Principle brief introduction</H2><DIV class="mainText"><P>In this project, we combined the highly specific nanobody with the highly sensitive liquid
                        crystal detection to develop a detection method that meets the above conditions, and we hope to
                        achieve the semi-quantitative visual analysis of ß<SUB>2</SUB>m in urine of 150-400ng/ml. The normal
                        concentration of ß<SUB>2</SUB>m in human urine is about 150ng/ml, and other obvious symptoms appear when
                        the concentration of buxi2m in urine is about 450ng/ml. Firstly, nanobody was selected to
                        specifically bind the ß<SUB>2</SUB>m in urine, and long chain modification was carried out for improving
                        detection sensitivity. We performed the sentinel modification of the nanobacteria using a method
                        catalyzed by enterobacterium, and then linked other molecules with active and specialized
                        aldehyde groups. Compared with traditional antibodies, nanobody has smaller molecular weight, is
                        not easily denatured, and still has complete antigen-binding property. Moreover, the nanobody
                        can be expressed by escherichia coli as the host, and the preparation cost is greatly
                        reduced.</P><TABLE class="img"><TBODY><TR><TD><P class="footnote">Fig.1 A schematic of catalysis in E. coli</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>More subtly, we took advantage of crystals' fluidity and anisotropy. First, the substrate of the
                        liquid crystal pool was modified with an antigen, and then a certain concentration of nanobody
                        and the mixture of the solution to be tested were added. After a period of reaction, some
                        antibodies preferentially bound with the scaffold ß<SUB>2</SUB>M in the solution, and the other with the
                        substrate ß<SUB>2</SUB>M. After the glass slides were rinsed, the microenvironment of the liquid crystal
                        base changed due to the combination of ß<SUB>2</SUB>m and Nb, resulting in obvious color or light and shade
                        differences of the liquid crystal, thus realizing the visualization of detection. Finally, we
                        expressed the brightness of the liquid crystal with the gray value of the image, and established
                        the relationship between the fixed antigen concentration of the liquid crystal substrate and the
                        gray value of the image.</P><TABLE class="img"><TBODY><TR><TD colspan="2"><P class="footnote">Fig.2 The object to be tested changes the orientations of the liquid
                                    crystal alignment</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV><DIV><H2 class="title">Results and outlook</H2><DIV class="mainText"><P>Based on the above principles and design, we firstly verified that there was a significant
                        correlation between the liquid crystal brightness and the concentration of fixed mountain 2M,
                        and through the optimization of the parameters of the detection system, the liquid crystal
                        brightness changed significantly when the antigen concentration was 150ng/mL-400ng/mL. In
                        addition, the antibody with long chain modification is selected for detection, and the
                        brightness changes of the liquid crystal are more obvious, which can achieve the purpose of
                        effective and reliable detection.</P><P>At the same time, we designed a test box of 5cm × 5cm × 10cm to demonstrate our product. The
                        short-term goal of this project is to make the patients in the home use of our test kits, only
                        need to add a drop of urine and auxiliary drops wait for a period of time after taking a
                        picture, can intuitive understanding to your beta 2 m concentration in the urine and kidney
                        function, when he will photos uploaded to the mobile terminal, can generate individualized
                        treatment guidelines.</P><P>Of course, we have a better idea. We can use this test to determine a variety of proteins. After
                        all, there are many diseases that require more accurate diagnosis using one or a series of
                        proteins in urine or blood. For example, AD7c-ntp in urine can be used as an indicator of
                        alzheimer's disease. The index of coronary heart disease is 15 kinds of urine polypeptide
                        combination. To do this we simply need to design a new type of 96-well plate that imparts
                        different antigens to the substrate to enable the determination of multiple proteins and even
                        proteomics.</P></DIV><DIV class="mainText"><P class="footnote">[1] Xue R, Gui D, Zheng L, Zhai R, Wang F, Wang N. Mechanistic Insight and
