Fixation of Nanobodies
The Nanobody was dissolved in 0.01 mol/L of PBS buffer (pH=7.4) and configured to have                             different                             concentrations of the Nanobody solution. Appropriate amount of Nano-antibody solution was                             added                             dropwise to the surface of the lower slide, and reacted at 37℃ for 2 h. After removal, it                             was                             washed with 0.01 mol/L PBS buffer (pH=7.4) and deionized water to remove unfixed Nanobody                             molecules.

Production of liquid crystal cell
The treated upper and lower slides were assembled face to face, and the slides were separated                             by                             Mylar polyester sheets (intermediate open convex cavity), and the other three sides were                             fixed                             with small clips except for the opening direction. A small amount of liquid crystal is                             injected                             into the liquid crystal cell from the opening by capillary action, and the liquid crystal is                             filled with the entire cavity, and then observed by a polarizing microscope. And record the                             image results.
Optimization of Experimental Conditions
Explore the appropriate antibody concentration
Time:
20 July: Antibody concentration 50ng/ml. Antibody concentration 200ng/ml.
21 July: Antibody concentration 500ng/ml. Antibody concentration 1000ng/ml.
30 July: Antibody concentration 1ng/ml. Antibody concentration 10ng/ml. Antibody                                 concentration 50ng/ml.
Since the antibody itself has a corresponding perturbation effect on the liquid crystal, in                             order                             to avoid the influence of the nano-antibody perturbation effect on the experimental results,                             we                             carried out an experiment to determine the appropriate concentration of the antibody, and we                             selected 50 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL, 2000 ng/mL antibody respectively. The                             concentration                             was tested and three parallel experimental groups were set for each concentration. Parallel                             light and conical light were used for observation. The parallel light observation results                             (Fig.                             1) were all black, indicating that the liquid crystal remained vertical.

Figure 1 Effect of antigen concentration gradient on liquid crystal                             alignment
Since the experimental results did not result in antibody concentrations that caused the                             liquid                             crystals to align in parallel and cause color changes, we continued to increase the                             concentration for experiments. Experiments were performed at 1 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL to obtain                             the                             results of parallel light. Parallel light observations still show all black, and                             cross-contrast                             observations have crosshairs. It is indicated that the liquid crystals are still mostly                             arranged                             vertically. The critical concentration for changing the liquid crystal from the vertical                             alignment to the parallel alignment was not found, but it was found that the antibody                             concentration of 10 ng/mL or less did not cause a change in the color of the liquid                             crystal.

Explore the appropriate antibody concentration
Time:
23 Aug: Antibody concentration 125ng/ml. Antibody concentration 2000ng/ml.
Since the preliminary experiment for exploring the appropriate antibody concentration did not                             find a critical value of the antibody concentration that can change the alignment of the                             liquid                             crystal, it is known from the search that the concentration of the antibody below 10 ng/mL                             does                             not affect the liquid crystal alignment, so we refer to the literature and related research.                             It                             is recommended by field personnel to select a concentration of 500 ng/mL as the initial                             antibody concentration for detecting the antigen. Since the amount of antigen (β2-MG) in                             the urine of our                             current patients with chronic kidney disease is 125 ng/mL in unit conversion, we hope to                             determine the optimal antibody critical concentration by antigen concentration so that the                             concentration is lower than 125 ng/mL. The antigen does not allow the liquid crystals to be                             aligned in parallel, while antigens at concentrations above 125 ng/mL just align the liquid                             crystals in parallel.
Therefore, our team selected 125 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL antigen concentrations for                             experiments. The number of bright spots in 0.125 ng/mL-2 ng/mL parallel light images                             increased                             accordingly, but the overall color was black, and the difference was not large enough                             (Figure                             3). Not enough to determine the standard line of detection. (Note: due to 1000 ng/mL data                             file                             corruption, not shown in the figure)

DMOAP interference exclusion experiment
Time:
25 Aug: Antibody concentration 500ng/ml.
Since the previous experiments used high antibody concentration or high antigen                             concentration,                             the liquid crystals could not be arranged in parallel to discolor the observation. We                             reflect on                             whether the concentration of DMOAP in the experiment has an interference effect on the                             experimental results. Since DMOAP plays a role in inducing the vertical alignment of liquid                             crystals in the experiment, the reason for the analysis may be that DMOAP leads to the                             failure                             to obtain ideal experimental results. So we chose 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8% DMOAP                             concentration,                             and the antibody concentration was still 500 ng/mL. The DMOAP concentration was different,                             and                             the number of bright spots in the parallel light image was different (Fig. 4). From 0.8% to                             0.2%                             concentration, the main body of the image is black, but the number of bright spots is                             significantly increased. The number of bright spots is much higher at 0.2%; the number of                             bright                             spots on the image is less at 0.8%, which is equivalent to the previous 1%                             concentration.

Since the experimental results are not ideal, we consider re-selecting the experimental                             protocol.                             After consulting the literature and discussing with the professional researchers in the                             field,                             we decided to use the competition method. The following is the experimental plan.

Immobilization of antigen
The antigen was dissolved in 0.01 mol/L of PBS buffer (pH = 7.4) and configured to have                             different                             concentrations of the antigen solution. An appropriate amount of the antigen solution was                             added                             dropwise to the surface of the lower slide and reacted at 37℃ for 2 h. After taking out,                             they                             were washed with 0.01 mol/L PBS buffer (pH=7.4) and deionized water, and the unfixed antigen                             molecules were removed, dried with N2 and stored at -20℃.
Production of liquid crystal cell
The treated upper and lower slides were assembled face to face, and the slides were separated                             by                             Mylar polyester sheets (intermediate open convex cavity), and the other three sides were                             fixed with small clips except for the opening direction. A small amount of liquid crystal is                             injected                             into the liquid crystal cell from the opening by capillary action, and the liquid crystal is                             filled with the entire cavity, and then observed by a polarizing microscope.

Nanobody binds to immobilized antigen
According to the competitive immunoassay method, an appropriate amount of a certain                             concentration                             of the nano-antibody solution was sequentially added dropwise to the slide to which the                             antigen                             was immobilized, and reacted at 37℃ for 1 h. Rinse with 0.01 mol/L PBS buffer (pH=7.4) and                             deionized water to remove non-specific adsorbed substances, and dried with N2. A                             liquid crystal                             cell was prepared according to the method (4), and a change in color and brightness of the                             liquid crystal film was observed using a polarizing microscope and image analysis was                             performed.
Experiment of Suitable Antigen Concentration
Time:
30 Aug: Antigen concentration 500ng/ml; Antigen concentration 1000ng/ml; Antigen                                 concentration 2000ng/ml; Antigen concentration 4000ng/ml.
2 Sept: Antigen concentration 100ng/ml; Antigen concentration 200ng/ml; Antigen                                 concentration 300ng/ml; Antigen concentration 400ng/ml.
We investigated the effect of antigens of different concentrations on the vertical alignment                             of                             liquid crystals without antibodies. The methods of antigen-antibody immobilization on glass                             were                             collected from the literature of silkworm (crosslinked glutaraldehyde).The antigen was                             dissolved                             in 0.01 mol/L of PBS buffer (pH = 7.4) and configured to have                             0.1mg/L, 0.2mg/L, 0.3mg/L, 0.4mg/L, 0.5mg/L, 1mg/L, 2mg/L and 4mg/L of the antigen solution                             to have                             experiments with 1% DMOAP. For details of subsequent treatment, please refer to the third                             step of                             competitive immunoassay method. Antigen concentration gradient is small in the first five                             groups                             while antigen concentration gradient of the last three groups is big. Three parallel                             experiments                             were carried out in each group, and we chose the best picture to integrate them together. We                             observed bright spots separately under quadruple and tenfold objective. The specific results                             of                             the experiment are recorded as follows:
a. Images of 0.1mg/L, 0.2mg/mL, 0.3mg/L, 0.4mg/L, 0.5mg/L, 1mg/L, 2mg/L,                             4mg/L                             of antigens in proper order under a quadruple objective
b. Images of 0.1mg/L, 0.2mg/mL, 0.3mg/L, 0.4mg/L, 0.5mg/L, 1mg/L, 2mg/L,                             4mg/L                             of antigens in proper order under a tenfold objective
From the image, we can see that there is little difference among 0.1mg/L, 0.2mg/L and 0.3mg/L                             of                             antigens. It showed that the antigens in this concentration range have almost no effect on                             the                             vertical alignment of liquid crystal. The number of bright spots increased, but not more                             differences among 0.5mg/L-4mg/L. It suggested that the molecular weight of antigen may be                             too                             small to affect the vertical alignment of liquid crystal. Therefore, the effect of antigens                             of                             0.5mg/L concentration on the vertical alignment of liquid crystals is good.

Time:
8 Sept: Antigen concentration 500ng/ml, antibody concentration 500 ng/ml; Antigen                                 concentration 500ng/ml, antibody concentration 1000 ng/ml; Antigen concentration                                 500ng/ml,                                 antibody concentration 1500 ng/ml; Antigen concentration 500ng/ml, antibody                                 concentration                                 2000 ng/ml.
9 Sept: Antigen concentration 500ng/ml, antibody concentration 250 ng/ml; Antigen                                 concentration 500ng/ml, antibody concentration 500 ng/ml.
10 Sept: Antigen concentration 500ng/ml, antibody concentration 500 ng/ml.
After the experiment of suitable antigen concentration, we found that the effect of antigens                             of                             0.5mg/L concentration on the vertical alignment of liquid crystals is good. Therefore, we                             take                             the concentration of antibody solution as 0.5mg/L as the premise to investigate suitable                             nanobody concentration. An appropriate amount of 0.5mg/L, 1mg/L, 1.5mg/L and 0.5mg/L concentration                             of the nano-antibody solution was sequentially added dropwise to the slide to which the                             antigen                             was immobilized. For details of subsequent treatment, please refer to the fifth step of                             competitive immunoassay method .Three parallel experiments were carried out in each group,                             and                             we chose the best picture to integrate them together under both quadruple and tenfold                             objective.                             As the results are good, we intend to explore the lowest limit of antibody concentration by                             immersion（Add the liquid to a clean Petri dish and immerse the slide in）. The specific                             results                             of the experiment are recorded as follows:

Verify Antigen Concentration Experiment
Time:
12 Sept: Antigen concentration 1000ng/ml, antibody concentration 1000 ng/ml; Antigen                                 concentration 500ng/ml, antibody concentration 1000 ng/ml; Antigen concentration                                 62.5mg/L,                                 antibody concentration 5000 ng/ml; Antigen concentration 62.5 mg/L, antibody                                 concentration                                 1000 ng/ml;Antigen concentration 31.25 mg/L, antibody concentration 500 ng/ml; Antigen                                 concentration 31.25 mg/L, antibody concentration 1000 ng/ml.
Due to the instability of the experimental results we have done before, we need to detect the                             antigen concentration and antibody concentration, and use several extreme antigen                             concentrations                             to determine whether there is a problem with our antigen concentration. And considering the                             damage of the slide and the slide pool, in the self-assembly of the slide, the slide was                             dried                             at 110℃ for 1 h and changed to dry at 80℃ for 1 h. At the same time, the antigen fixation                             process still adopts the method of soaking.
We changed the fixed antigen concentration to 1 mg/L and the corresponding antibody to 1000                             ng/mL                             (shown in Figure (5)a). Four parallel experiments were performed. We also made a fixed                             antigen                             to 62.5mg / L, 31.25mg / L, and explored the results of the two antigen concentrations, the                             combined antibody was 500ng / ml and 1000 ng / ml (Figure (5) b, c, d, e), did four                             experiments,                             four experiments in each group. Finally, we carried out the experimental results when the                             fixed                             antigen was 500 ng/mL and the antibody was 1000 ng/mL (shown in Figure (5)f). Two parallel                             experiments were performed to determine whether there was a deviation in the results of our                             previous experiments.

The result can be that the combination of the two can disturb the alignment of the liquid                             crystal. At the same time, the antigen is fixed.
Explore the Appropriate Concentration of Nanobodies Again
Time:
15 Sept: Antigen concentration 500ng/ml, antibody concentration 1000 ng/ml; Antigen                                 concentration 500ng/ml, antibody concentration 1500 ng/ml.
Following the last experiment, we thought that 500 ng/mL antigen fixation is currently                             reasonable. So we did the effect of antibody concentration of 1000 ng/mL and 1500 ng/mL at                             an                             antigen concentration of 500 ng/mL (Figure (6) a, b), where we will self-assemble the upper                             and                             lower slides. And considering the damage of the slide and the slide pool, in the                             self-assembly                             of the slide, the slide was dried at 110℃ for 1 h and changed to dry at 80℃ for 1 h. At the                             same                             time, the antigen fixation process still adopts the method of soaking. Three sets of                             parallel                             experiments were performed separately.
Then we also made a set of antigen concentration of 500 ng / ml, antibody concentration of                             1500                             ng / ml (Figure (6) c). However, the method of soaking the immobilized antigen was not                             adopted,                             but the previous dropping method was employed.

Figure 6 Verifying the nanobody concentration experiment again
The experimental results showed that the antibody concentration was responsive at 1000 ng/mL                             and                             1500 ng/mL, and the results were obvious. Among them, the method of dropping antigen is more                             stable.
The Influence of GA and APTES
Time:
19 Sept: The influence with or without APTES and GA.
Since the previous results were more pronounced, we then explored the impact of GA and APTES                             on                             the results. We skipped the steps of immobilizing the antigen and dropping the antibody,                             directly performing the GA addition step after self-assembly of the slide, and exploring the                             effect of GA (shown in Figure (7)a). The impact of APTES is to observe the observations made                             after self-assembly (Figure (7)b).
a. APTES inquiry results
b. GA inquiry results
Figure 7 The impact of APTES and GA
It can be seen from the results that APTES and GA are negligible for liquid crystal                             disturbance.
Hydrophilic Experiment of Slide
In order to investigate how hydrophilic the slides were before and after antigen addition, we                             conducted a measurement of the contact angle experiment. Among them, we will self-assemble                             the                             upper and lower slides, and the upper and lower slides will be dried at 110℃ for 1 h,                             changed to                             be dried at 80℃ for 1 h. The method of immobilizing the antigen is to adopt a soaking                             method.
No antigen was added, and the contact angle of 50 ng/mL antigen with 500 ng/mL antigen was                             shown                             (Fig. 8 (8) a, b, c).

b. Antigen concentration 50ng/mL
c. Antigen concentration 500ng/mL
Figure 8 Results of the hydrophilicity test of the lower slide
It can be concluded that as the concentration of the immobilized antigen increases, the slide                             changes from hydrophobic to hydrophilic.
Study on Antigen Concentration and Fixed Time
Time:
26 Sept: Antigen concentrations of 500 ng/ml and 750 ng/ml were fixed for 12 h.
27 Sept: Antigen concentrations of 500 ng/ml and 750 ng/ml were fixed for 8.5 h.
After the discussion of the previous results, we discussed with the teacher, and then                             explored                             whether there is a problem with the antigen fixed time. We performed experimental results at                             antigen                             concentrations of 50 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL and fixed for 8.5 h and 12 h (Figures (9) a, b, c,                             d).                             Among them, we will self-assemble the upper and lower slides, and the upper and lower slides                             will be                             dried at 110℃ for 1 h, changed to be dried at 80℃ for 1h. The antigen fixation method is                             fixed                             by                             dropping.

Figure 9 Results of antigen fixation time
The experimental results show that the fixed time has a great relationship with the degree of                             liquid                             crystal disturbance. The longer the time, the more serious the disturbance.
