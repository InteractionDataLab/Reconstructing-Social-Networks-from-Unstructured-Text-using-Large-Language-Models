The First Generation of Dr. Familict
The first generation hardware design is very simple, consisting of only one square box, cool                         polarizer, one card slot, and one chip. This also brings the trouble of the user, the user needs                         to time and rinse. Below is the structure diagram and physical map of the first generation                         product.

Instruction
Dr. Familict, the visualized liquid-crystal-based urine protein detector, is a 20cm×20cm×10cm                         brick-sized box. It consists mainly a slide holder slot, a wash buffer chamber, a waste                         collector, a liquid-crystal cell, polarizer and analyzer. Up on using, just plug in a                         antigen-coated glass slide to the slot, a drop of antibody solution is loaded automatically when                         the slide is placed properly. The user then only needs to add a drop of urine to the test zone,                         and press the bottom to start timing. The following operations will be done automatically. After                         the reaction is completed, the slide is rinsed for 30 s. Then it is drove slightly to the                         detection area. Upon slide positioning, liquid-crystal is loaded and the bottom light is                         switched on upon slide positioning. After the polarized light passes, visible color changes are                         produced. Users can take a picture and upload the result to the Mobile APP and get medication                         advice.
Liquid-crystal Cell
The liquid crystal cell is the most important part of the test box. When the upper slider slides                         to the observation area, it is assembled with the upper slide of the liquid crystal cell into a                         self-assembled film spaced 6 micrometers apart, and then the liquid crystal cell on the left                         side of the slide is opened, and the liquid crystal enters between the upper and lower slides                         due to capillary action. At this point, the microstructure of the slide will affect the orientation change of the liquid crystal. After turning on the light at the bottom of the test                         box, the light passes through the polarizer, then through the cell, and finally through the                         analyzer above the cell, so we can observe changes in brightness and color.
Wash buffer chamber and waste collector
These two components are used to wash unfixed antigens, antibodies and other impurity proteins on                         the slide. When the user drops the urine and the antibody solution, the test box starts to                         timing. After the reaction reaches 40 minutes, the time is over, the buffer chamber gate is                         opened, the slide is started to be washed for 30 seconds, and the buffer flows into the waste                         collector. When the waste collection area is full and can be replaced, as the same user can                         easily replace the buffer box by himself.
