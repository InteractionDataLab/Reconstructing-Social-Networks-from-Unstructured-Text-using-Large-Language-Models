                        hospital for regular medical examinations. People pay less attention to the health of the
                        kidneys. We want to change this situation by using our portable urine testing equipment.
                        According to the practical data, we have found that more than 80% of respondents are willing to
                        use our products. Considering about the binding time of antigen and antibody and the
                        corresponding time of liquid crystal, the acceptable waiting time for respondents is about 40
                        minutes. We will shorten the waiting time under the condition of ensuring the accuracy of
                        measurement in the subsequent experiments.</P><P>This interview and sample survey enriched our project background data. We analyzed and processed
                        the data obtained from the survey and found that our project does have certain market demand.
                        This also laid the foundation for our subsequent optimization of experimental conditions.</P><TABLE class="img"><TBODY><TR><TD><P class="footnote">Fig.1 interview with the public</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV><DIV><H2 class="title">Interviews with doctors</H2><DIV class="mainText"><P>In August 2018, the team members went to Linyi City People's Hospital of Shandong Province to
                        interview Dr. Liu Haijun, a specialist in nephrology. We knew that early diagnosis and treatment
                        are extremely important in delaying the development of kidney disease. Only when the patient has
                        obvious symptoms will he go to the hospital for an examination. But they may already have
                        entered the dominant diabetic nephropathy (overtDN).</P><P>Blood test is the most common diagnosis method of the hospital currently. It takes ¥48 to test
                        the blood β<SUB>2</SUB>-microglobulin. However, Dr.Liu said that if a portable urine test method can be
                        developed, it can not only alleviate the pain of blood drawing, but also greatly improve the
                        awareness of diabetes patients and the rate of early visits.</P><P>In this interview we exchanged ideas with doctors, and we have learned that from a clinical
                        perspective, our project is more suitable for use at home. It can greatly arouse the awareness
                        of early patients, which can indirectly improve the diagnosis rate and provide the best time for
                        treatment.</P><TABLE class="img"><TBODY><TR><TD colspan="2"><P class="footnote">Fig.2 Interviews with doctors</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV><DIV><H2 class="title">Interview with the researches in the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics(DICP)</H2><DIV class="mainText"><P>In order to better understand the current situation of urine testing, the team members came to
                        the Research Group of Biomolecular Efficient Separation and Characterization of Dalian Institute
                        of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences in October 2018. We exchanged ideas with
                        researcher Yuan Huiming. Researcher Yuan said that the main problem in urine testing is to
                        eliminate interference from other proteins in the urine. The nanobody of β<SUB>2</SUB>-microglobulin we
                        selected is more specific and can solve this problem well. On the other hand, our liquid crystal
                        detection method has extremely high sensitivity and has great advantages for the detection of
                        trace proteins in urine.</P><P>This exchange allowed us to see the achievability and practical application of our project from
                        the aspect of technical application. It also let us have confidence in our projects.</P><TABLE class="img"><TBODY><TR><TD colspan="2"><P class="footnote">Fig.3 Interview with the researches</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer"><DIV id="address"><H3> Address</H3><P>No.2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian City, Liaoning Province, P.R.C., 116024</P><H3> E-mail</H3><P>igem_dlut_china_B#163.com (Please replace # with @)</P></DIV><DIV id="follow"><H3>Follow Us</H3><DIV id="platformName"><P> WeChat</P><P> Weibo</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
