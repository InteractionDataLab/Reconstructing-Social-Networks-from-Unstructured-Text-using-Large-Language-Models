                        hospital tested by high-tech testing equipment. We designed our products which can upload
                        grayscale data to the cloud and analyze it through mobile devices obviously. What we required is
                        just a liquid crystal detection scheme, which is sufficient to reflect the change in
                        β<SUB>2</SUB>-MG
                        concentration.</P><P>The main purpose of our experiment is to prove whether the change in β<SUB>2</SUB>-MG
                        concentration in the
                        home test box (Dr. Familict) can be reflected in the liquid crystal through a noticeable gray
                        scale change. Therefore, we have constructed a molecule that is more suitable for the liquid
                        crystal detection system based on the nano-antibody, a competitive combination which can disturb
                        the liquid crystal to change the gray level of the image.</P><P>We designed a competitive binding method : First, immobilizing a certain amount of β<SUB>2</SUB>-MG
                        in a
                        liquid crystal, and then combining the test solution with an excess of Nanobody. The mixture is
                        then added to the liquid crystal, and due to the excess of the Nanobody, the excess is bound to
                        the immobilized β<SUB>2</SUB>-MG, causing perturbation of the liquid crystal. Since the fixed
                        β<SUB>2</SUB>-MG is a
                        certain amount, the amount of β<SUB>2</SUB>-MG in the liquid to be tested can be calculated by
                        the
                        difference method. However, during the experiment, we found that the nano-antibody itself has
                        little disturbance to the liquid crystal, so we hope to construct a more interfering molecule
                        based on the nano-antibody. At the same time, we tested the effects of different β<SUB>2</SUB>-MG
                        and
                        nanobody concentrations on liquid crystal perturbations, and hope to find a set of solutions
                        with the most obvious gray scale changes.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><H2 class="title">Experiment</H2><DIV class="mainText"><P>Our experiments are mainly divided into two parts: molecular biology experiments and liquid
                        crystal experiments. </P><P>We obtained nano-antibodies with aldehyde groups by adding aldehyde-based labels to
                        nano-antibodies and by FGE treatment. After that, we added C18 to the Nanobody to enhance its
                        interference. Finally, we verified that the interference of the antigen concentration on the
                        liquid crystal can be detected.</P><P>In the molecular biology sector, we planned to connect a long-chain molecule (C18) on the
                        nanobody in order to increase the interference of nano-antibodies on liquid crystals.</P><P>Firstly, We constructed two plasmids, pET28a and pBAD. The first plasmid pET28a contains a
                        nanobody and a gene with an aldehyde-based catalytic substrate tag. The second plasmid, pBAD,
                        contains the FGE (Formylglycine-generating enzyme) gene. Then we changed the conversion plan
                        several times due to poor conversion efficiency, and finally got a satisfactory conversion

                        cell, the substrate tag was converted to an aldehyde group by FGE treatment. Subsequently, after
                        the transformation of aldehyde-based nanobody, we disrupted the cells by sonication and purified
                        the disrupted cell suspension to obtain the nanobody we needed. Next step, we combined the
                        Nanobody with C18. We have obtained a better experimental protocol by changing the
                        conditions.</P><P>We designed a liquid crystal cell as the observation carrier. Firstly, we modified the slides

                            substrate , binding with 400ng/mL β<SUB>2</SUB>-MG nano-antibody. In addition, we determined
                            that the detection sensitivity of the antibody at β<SUB>2</SUB>-MG modified by C18 was
                            higher. Therefore, we can detect the concentration of β<SUB>2</SUB>-MG in the range of
                            100ng/ ml-400ng /mL (a theoretical estimate) by this method, which meets our requirements
                            for the early diagnosis of nephropathy patients.</P><P>Through a series of Confirmatory experiment, we have proved that in the early stage of
                            chronic
                            kidney disease, our detection system can indeed reflect the changes in β<SUB>2</SUB>-MG
                            concentration,
                            which can remind users to go to the hospital for further testing.</P><P>In the future, we plan to establish a more complete back-office system, which can directly
                            obtain more accurate test results based on the user's past physical indicators.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer"><DIV id="address"><H3> Address</H3><P>No.2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian City, Liaoning Province, P.R.C., 116024</P><H3> E-mail</H3><P>igem_dlut_china_B#163.com (Please replace # with @)</P></DIV><DIV id="follow"><H3>Follow Us</H3><DIV id="platformName"><P> WeChat</P><P> Weibo</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
