Gray value-density model The relationship between the gray value and the added                     substance concentration
We have established a grayscale model to describe our results in antigen fixation, antibody                         immobilization and detection, and to digitize the results into accurate numbers. This model can                         guide us to more accurately determine the relationship between the reaction results and our                         effects in three phases. Especially in the detection, the concentration of the analyte can be                         embodied and digitized, thus giving us a better and specific detection limit.
For the gray value calculation of a resulting image, we first grayscale it. In order to calculate                         the gray value of the color picture, we have grayed out with MATLAB. At the same time, in order                         to give a clear grayscale picture, we performed image equalization and gave a balanced                         picture[Attachment 1]. After obtaining the grayscale image, we use the formula (1) to                         calculate the grayscale of the image. In order to obtain accurate data more conveniently, we use                         the programming language to design a small software [Attachment 2], which can                         calculate the average grayscale of the image. There is an error in the data for the no grayscale                         picture. According to our experimental results, it is about 5% when the gray value is not too                         low. Compared with the equalized grayscale image, the error is about 10%.
$$ g_w = \sum_{i=0}^{255} i \times T_i \div T \tag{1} $$
For the experimental results, we can understand whether it is fixed antigen, immobilized antibody                         or detection. In the initial stage, the gray value is positively correlated with the                         concentration of the additive; and as the concentration of the additive increases, the gray                         value is not proportional to the increase. There are two models that satisfy these properties,                         namely equation (2) and formula (3):
Michaelis-Menten model: $$ y = \frac{\alpha x}{\beta + x} \tag{2} $$
Exponential growth model: $$ y = \alpha (1- exp(-\beta x)) \tag{3} $$
We substituting the above two formulas into the literature we examined[2], where model                         (2) is in                         good agreement. At the same time model (2) if the enzyme is compared to our slide, the substrate                         is analogous to our addition. The resulting enzymatic reaction rate-substrate concentration and                         gray value-addition concentration have a good fit. So we decided to use this model. And in the                         other literature[1] of the model, the results obtained are also consistent. The gray                         value and                         concentration relationship in this model are shown in Fig. 1(a), This applies to both fixed                         antigens, immobilized antibodies and assays. The different added substances are shown in                         Fig. 2(b).

(c) Fixed antigen grayscale model curve
Fig.1 Gray value and additive concentration relationship
In the step of immobilizing the antigen, we control the amount of antigen added, the fixed time,                         and the brightness and the observation magnification at the time of sampling, and use a large                         amount of experimental data to average and reduce the error. Experimental Results After data                         processing, the Figures 1(c), Equations \(\mathrm{Y_1}\), can be obtained. The resulting image                         was used to                         predict other data and found good agreement. Explain that the gray value-concentration model we                         built is in line with our experiments. Thus, we further established the model on antibody                         immobilization and obtained the results of equations \(\mathrm{Z_1}\). From the model and our                         experimental                         data, it can be stated that the gray value and the additive concentration are positively                         correlated when the concentration is not large. From the model and our experimental data, it can                         be stated that the gray value and the additive concentration are positively correlated when the                         concentration is not very large and more than 0.4 μg/ml.
$$ y = 6.4904 x \quad \mathrm{(Y_1)} $$
$$ y = 9.3506 x \quad \mathrm{(Z_1)} $$
There is a bias when the antigen is not fixed. Therefore, we perform a statistical average of the                         gray values of the unfixed antigen. The \(\mathrm{Y_1}\) equation is the result of correcting                         the zero                         point deviation and the post-processing of the comparison relation \(\mathrm{Ψ_q}\).                         \(\mathrm{Z_1}\) can be obtained                         by treating the modified antibody model in the same manner.

Kinetic model The relationship between residual antigen concentration and                     time
In order to optimize the antigen fixation time, we did the relationship between the remaining                         antigen concentration and time when the antigen was immobilized.
In our step of fixing the antigen concentration, we can get the reaction formula                         \(\mathrm{\alpha}\) and give the                         pattern diagram ω1, where \(A\) is the antigen and \(M\) is the reaction site concentration                         on the                         slide. Since the addition liquid fixation and treatment methods are unchanged, \(M_0\) does not                         change.
$$A+M\overset{K_a}{\underset{K_d}{\rightleftharpoons}}A-M \tag{ α }$$
If \(\theta=\frac{[A-M]}{M_0}\), that is, the position occupied by the immobilized antigen                         accounts for the percentage of all positions of the entire slide. Then by the dynamics                         relationship, we can list the relationship:
$$-\frac{d[A]}{dt}=K_a(1-\theta)[M_0][A]-K_d\theta[M_0]$$
If we determine a \(\theta\), that is, we want the percentage of the fixed position on the slide,                         generally the maximum concentration under the premise of disturbing the liquid crystal. It is                         given by our experimental data that \(\theta\) is generally optimal between 0.05 and 0.1. Let                         \(b=\frac{K_a}{K_d}\), we can get the relationship:
$$[A]=C_1exp[-K_a(1-\theta)[M_0]t]+\frac{\theta}{b(1-\theta)}$$
In this way we can get the relationship between the residual concentration of the added antigen                         and the reaction time (4):
$$[A]=C_1exp[mt]+n\tag{4}$$
Thus, from the relationship we can predict the relationship between the residual antigen                         concentration and time, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b).
(a) One Concentration
The relationships of multiple concentration
Fig.2 Relationship between residual antigen concentration and time                                     when immobilized antigen
Combined with formula (2) inside the grayscale model content, we can obtain the following                         relationship (5), the relationship between antigen fixed time and gray value. As shown in Fig.                         3.
$$Grayscale value=\frac{\sigma_1exp[mt]+\Psi_1}{\beta_0+C_1exp[mt]}\tag{5}$$
Fig.3 Relationship between antigen fixation time and result gray                                 value
It can be concluded that the reaction can be stopped by 90% or 80% of the reaction, because it is                         uneconomical to continue the reaction. At the same time, for the initial antigen concentration                         change, the initial large reaction starts to be fast, while the initial value is small, the                         reaction rate starts to be small; at the same time, the optimum reaction time for the different                         concentrations of the added antigen is about the same, and has little relationship with the                         concentration. Finally, there is a clear relationship between the fixed time of the antigen and                         the gray value.
Adding antigen concentration and adding antibody concentration ratio relationship
In order to the final result was as expected by making the solubility of the configured                         antigen-antibody immobilization solution. It is necessary for us to optimize the concentration                         ratio for them.
After fixing the antigen. For immobilized antibodies, there is a reaction \(β\) and the pattern                         diagram \(ω_2\):
$$A'+R_T\overset{K_a}{\underset{K_d}{\rightleftharpoons}}R_TA' \tag{ β }$$
Fig.ω2 Fixed antibody pattern
If we define a \(θ_2\), which represents the effect that we would like to achieve when                         immobilizing an antibody, it is generally the antibody concentration that can disrupt the                         percentage of gray that the liquid crystal reaches our defined full brightness. At this time,                         there is also a relation (6):
$$[R_T]=C_2exp[Qt]+P\tag{6}$$
When the reaction is sufficient, it is assumed to be \(t_0\). For the relationship between the                         reaction \(\beta\):
$$K_a(1-\theta_2)[R_T]=K_d\theta_2$$
$$\theta_2=\frac{[R_TA']}{[R_{T0}]}$$
Combining relation (4), we can get relation (7):
$$\frac{[R_{T0}]}{A_0}=\alpha+\frac{\beta}{C_1+n}\tag{7}$$
Among them, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) have a large correlation with \(\theta_2\), but have little                         correlation with \(\theta\). From our experimental data, it can be given that \(\theta_2\) meets                         our requirements when it reaches 0.5~0.7. Under the preconditions, relation (8) and Fig. 4 can                         be derived:
$$\frac{[R_{T0}]}{A_0}=K\theta_2+b\tag{8}$$
Fig.4 The relationship between the optimal ratio of antibody                                 antigen concentration and θ2
When we determine the residual antigen concentration and time relationship when fixing the                         antigen and the residual antibody concentration and time relationship when immobilizing the                         antibody, we can use this model to give the optimal concentration ratio for immobilized antigen                         and antibody by combining the given \(\theta\) and \(\theta_2\).
At the same time, it can be concluded that the proportional relationship is closely related to                         our expected \(\theta_2\), and there is no clear relationship with our expected \(\theta\).
The relationship between the Grayscale value and the reaction time of the liquid to be                     tested
When our finished product is inspected, we want to obtain the minimum detection time and                         determine the credibility of the test results. Therefore, the relationship between the test                         result and time is made. The reaction \(\gamma\) and the pattern diagram ω3 are as                         follows:
$$R_TA\overset{K_{d1}}{\underset{K_{a1}}{\rightleftharpoons}}A+R_T$$
$$P+R_T\overset{K_{a2}}{\underset{K_{d2}}{\rightleftharpoons}}R_TP \tag{ γ }$$
Figure. ω3 Detection mode diagram
For the detection, we assume that the immobilized antigen is not easily detached outside of the                         reaction, and the amount of free antibody during the reaction is very small and remains                         substantially unchanged. Using this free antibody steady-state and kinetic knowledge, we derive                         the relationship (9):
\begin{equation}\begin{split}                         [R_TA]=&Cexp[-(K_{d2}+K_{a2}[R_T])t]\\&+\frac{K_{d2}(K_{d2}[R_TA_0]+[R_T])-K_{a2}([P_0]-[R_TA_0]+[R_T])[R_T]}{K_{d2}+K_{a2}[R_T]}                         \end{split}\tag{9}\end{equation}
equal meaning between \([R_TA_0]\) and \([R_TA]_0\).
By simplification of relation (9) and combining relation (2) inside the grayscale model content,                         relations (10) and (11) can be obtained:
$$[R_TA]=Cexp[xt]+y\tag{10}$$
$$Grayscale value=\frac{\sigma exp[xt]+Psi}{\beta+Cexp[xt]}\tag{11}$$
According to the relationship, We can obtain a detection curve expressed by the fixed                         antigen-antibody concentration. The relationship between high and low sensitivity detection                         curves can also be obtained (slide detection sensitivity and antigen-antibody positive                         correlation).And we can list Fig. 5 (a)(b)(c):
(a) Relationship between fixed antigen-antibody concentration and                                 detection time
(b) Relationship between different fixed antigen-antibody                                 concentration                                 and detection time
(c) Gray value and detection time relationship diagram
Fig.5 Predictive graph during detection
From the analysis results, we can optimize the detection time in order to achieve the most                         effective time. At the same time, for a fixed antigen-antibody pair, the value is proportional                         to the initial reaction rate; the optimal time is approximately the same. Finally, there is a                         clear relationship between the detection time and the gray value relationship.
LIQUID CRYSTAL MOLECULES PERTURBATIONS MODEL
The field of synthetic biology relies heavily on mathematical models that help simulate and                         predict the process and consequence of biological systems. We developed two models, the radial                         domino model and the blooming model to describe the potential perturbation mechanism and                         interaction modes between protein particles and liquid crystal molecules. The protein density                         threshold can be calculated by this model.
Purpose
An important part of our liquid crystal experiment is to determine an optimal antigen                         concentration, so we creatively proposed two models to calculate the β2-M density                         microscopically. The trouble is that we do not know the range of antigen molecules that can                         perturb liquid crystal molecules. Therefore, we consulted the relevant parameters, proposed two                         models, calculated the range of the single antigen molecule to perturb the liquid crystal, and                         finally determined the threshold of the antigen concentration, which was consistent with our                         experimental results.

Hypothesis
Fig.9 Two possible mechanisms for β2-M to disturb liquid crystal
The process of protein perturbation of liquid crystal molecules is particularly complicated, so                         we can only guess the disturbance mechanism on our own. Inspired by dominoes and the blossoming                         of flowers, we proposed that there might be two mechanisms of disruption. We called them RADIAL                         DOMINO MODEL and BLOOMING MODEL
Fig.10 RADIAL DOMINO MODEL
Simplify the β2-M and 5CB as ball and stick. The distance between each two sticks is equal. Due                         to the interference of the ball, the first stick next to the ball will be inclined at an angle.                         The first stick will affect the next stick until the last stick is aligned vertically.
Fig.11 BLOOMING MODEL
This model is actually an extension of the previous model. Simplify the 5CB into one side of the                         polygons. As the molecular shells increases, the angle between the two sides of the polygon will                         tend to be 90°.
Calculation
1. Obtain the spacing of 5CB molecules
The forces between two molecules are covalent bonds, ionic bonds, metal bonds, hydrogen bonds and                         Van der Waals force. Because no other forces are present, the main force is Van der Waals force.                         The point at which the force becomes repulsive rather than attractive as two molecules near one                         another is called the van der Waals contact distance. Van der Waals force includes electrostatic                         force, dispersion force and induction force.
Fig.12 van der Waals potential energy
We can use a simplified formula: the Lennard-Jones potential[1].
$$E=\frac{A}{r^{12}}-\frac{B}{r^6}$$
where \(A=4\epsilon\sigma^{12}\), \(B=4\epsilon\sigma^6\).
However, there is no sigma Lennard-Jones parameters (Angstrom) epsilon Lennard-Jones parameters                         (kcal/mol) about 5CB, so we calculate the van der Waals contact distance(\(r_0\)) by statistical mechanics[2].
In statistical mechanics, the radial distribution function \(g(r)\) in a system of particles                         (atoms, molecules, colloids, etc.), describes how density varies as a function of distance from                         a reference particle.
Fig.13 The sketch map of radial distribution function
The radial distribution function:
$$\rho g(r)4\pi r^2=dN$$
where \(\rho\) is the density of 5CB, \(N\) is the total number of 5CB molecules. Integrate the                         above formula:
$$\int_0^\infty \rho g(r)4\pi r^2 \mathrm{d}r=\int_0^N\mathrm{d}N=N$$
$$g(r)=\frac{\mathrm{d}N}{\rho 4\pi r^2}$$
Molecular dynamics calculation:
$$g(r)=\frac{1}{\rho 4\pi r^2}\frac{\sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^N \Delta N(r\to r+\delta r)}{N\times                         T}$$
Where \(N\) is the number of molecules and \(T\) is the calculated time (steps), \(\Delta N\) is                         the number of molecules between \(r\) and \(r+\delta r\).
The radial distribution function can be computed via computer simulation methods. Because the                         peak of the radial distribution function appears at 0.5nm, so the spacing of 5CB molecules is                         around 0.5nm.
2. Calculate the range of β2-M that can perturb 5CB
We assume 5CB molecule as a ellipse (\(a\)=1nm, \(b\)=0.1nm), we got the tilt angles of three                         molecules by Matlab.
Fig.14 The tilt angles are 43°, 64°, 90° respectively.
\(\therefore\)Maximum radius of β2-M that can perturb 5CB (Fig. 10):
\(R_1=[2\times\sin (64^\circ )+1]\mathrm{nm}=\)2.8nm
3. Verification
In the liquid crystal experiment, the droplets dropped on the slide have a radius of about 2                         mm.
$$\therefore S=\pi R^2=4\pi\times 10^{12}\mathrm{nm^2}$$
The molecular weight of β2-M is 11800, the volume of the droplet is 10μL.
The area disturbed by each protein molecule is:
$$r=2.8\mathrm{nm}$$
$$S_0=\pi r^2=7.84\pi\mathrm{nm^2}$$
When the picture is just full colorful, the number of molecules contained in the droplet                         is:
$$N=\frac{S}{S_0}=5.1\times 10^{11}$$
$$m=\frac{11800\times 5.1\times 10^{11}}{6.02\times 10^{23}}=10^{-8}\mathrm{g}$$
\(\therefore\)Maximum concentration is:
\(c=\frac{m}{V}=\)1000ng/mL
That is to say, when the concentration reaches 1000ng/mL, the image starts to be completely                         bright. This is in good agreement with our experimental results. The following are the results                         of the liquid crystal experiment.
