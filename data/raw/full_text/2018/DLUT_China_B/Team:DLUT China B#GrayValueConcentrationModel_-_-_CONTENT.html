                        was established. The model can more accurately reflect the results of the three phases.
                        Especially in the test, the results can be digitized to provide better detection limits.</P><P>For the result of the gray value calculation, it is firstly grayscaled. Since it is a color
                        picture, it needs to be grayed out first with Matlab. At the same time, in order to give a clear
                        grayscale image, image equalization is performed and a balanced image is given<SUP>[Attachment
                            1]</SUP>. After obtaining the grayscale image, it is necessary to calculate the grayscale of
                        the image using the formula (1). To make it easier to get accurate data, design a small software<SUP>[Attachment
                            2]</SUP> in a programming language that calculates the average grayscale of the image. There
                        is an error in the data of the grayscale image. According to the experimental results, when the
                        gray value is not too low, it is about 5%. The error is about 10% compared to the balanced
                        grayscale image.</P><P>$$ g_w = \sum_{i=0}^{255} i \times T_i \div T \tag{1} $$</P><P>For the experimental results, no matter which process. In the initial stage, the gray value is
                        positively correlated with the concentration of the additive; as the additive concentration
                        increases, the gray value is not proportional to the increase. There are two models that satisfy
                        these properties, equation (2) and equation (3):</P><P>Michaelis-Menten model: $$ y = \frac{\alpha x}{\beta + x} \tag{2} $$</P><P>Exponential growth model: $$ y = \alpha (1- exp(-\beta x)) \tag{3} $$</P><P>Substituting the above two formulas into the relevant literature [2], where model (2) is very
                        consistent. Simultaneous model (2) If the enzyme is compared to a slide, the substrate is
                        similar to the additive. The resulting enzymatic reaction rate - substrate concentration and
                        gray value - has a good fit to the added concentration. So using this model is very suitable. In
                        other literature [1], the results obtained are also consistent. The relationship between gray
                        value and concentration in this model is shown in Figure 1(a), which applies to multiple stages
                        of the project. The different substances added are shown in Figure 2(b).</P><TABLE class="img"><TBODY><TR><TD><P class="footnote">(a) Addition of added substances</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P class="footnote">(b) Relationship between different additions and gray values (joined

                        experimental data is used to reduce the error. Experimental Results After data processing,
                        Figure 1 (c), Equation \(\mathrm{Y_1}\), can be obtained. The resulting image was used to
                        predict
                        other data and found good consistency. The established gray value - concentration model is
                        consistent with the experiment. Therefore, the antibody immobilization model was further
                        established and the result of the equation \(\mathrm{Z_1}\) was obtained. It can be seen from
                        the
                        model and experimental data that the gray value is positively correlated with the additive
                        concentration when the concentration is not large. It can be seen from the model and
                        experimental data that the gray value is positively correlated with the additive concentration

                        the result of correcting the zero point deviation and comparing the relationship \(\mathrm{Ψ_q}\). \(\mathrm{Z_1}\) can be
