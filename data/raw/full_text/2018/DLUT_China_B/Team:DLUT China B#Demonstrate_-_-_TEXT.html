Background
In order to fulfill the requirements of testing diseases at home for patients instead of going to                         hospital tested by high-tech testing equipment. We designed our products which can upload                         grayscale data to the cloud and analyze it through mobile devices obviously. What we required is                         just a liquid crystal detection scheme, which is sufficient to reflect the change in                         β2-MG                         concentration.
The main purpose of our experiment is to prove whether the change in β2-MG                         concentration in the                         home test box (Dr. Familict) can be reflected in the liquid crystal through a noticeable gray                         scale change. Therefore, we have constructed a molecule that is more suitable for the liquid                         crystal detection system based on the nano-antibody, a competitive combination which can disturb                         the liquid crystal to change the gray level of the image.
We designed a competitive binding method : First, immobilizing a certain amount of β2-MG                         in a                         liquid crystal, and then combining the test solution with an excess of Nanobody. The mixture is                         then added to the liquid crystal, and due to the excess of the Nanobody, the excess is bound to                         the immobilized β2-MG, causing perturbation of the liquid crystal. Since the fixed                         β2-MG is a                         certain amount, the amount of β2-MG in the liquid to be tested can be calculated by                         the                         difference method. However, during the experiment, we found that the nano-antibody itself has                         little disturbance to the liquid crystal, so we hope to construct a more interfering molecule                         based on the nano-antibody. At the same time, we tested the effects of different β2-MG                         and                         nanobody concentrations on liquid crystal perturbations, and hope to find a set of solutions                         with the most obvious gray scale changes.
Experiment
Our experiments are mainly divided into two parts: molecular biology experiments and liquid                         crystal experiments.
We obtained nano-antibodies with aldehyde groups by adding aldehyde-based labels to                         nano-antibodies and by FGE treatment. After that, we added C18 to the Nanobody to enhance its                         interference. Finally, we verified that the interference of the antigen concentration on the                         liquid crystal can be detected.
In the molecular biology sector, we planned to connect a long-chain molecule (C18) on the                         nanobody in order to increase the interference of nano-antibodies on liquid crystals.
Firstly, We constructed two plasmids, pET28a and pBAD. The first plasmid pET28a contains a                         nanobody and a gene with an aldehyde-based catalytic substrate tag. The second plasmid, pBAD,                         contains the FGE (Formylglycine-generating enzyme) gene. Then we changed the conversion plan                         several times due to poor conversion efficiency, and finally got a satisfactory conversion                         rate.
We wanted to see that the substrate tag can be finally expressed at the inactive end of the                         nanobody in E. coli BL21, and has little effect on the conformation of the nanobody. In the                         cell, the substrate tag was converted to an aldehyde group by FGE treatment. Subsequently, after                         the transformation of aldehyde-based nanobody, we disrupted the cells by sonication and purified                         the disrupted cell suspension to obtain the nanobody we needed. Next step, we combined the                         Nanobody with C18. We have obtained a better experimental protocol by changing the                         conditions.
We designed a liquid crystal cell as the observation carrier. Firstly, we modified the slides                         with DMOAP which can induce vertical alignment of the liquid crystals, making the initial state                         of the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell black. Meanwhile, we modified the slides with                         APTES so that they can be attached to the β2-MG; Then we added β2-MG                         nanobody to the modified slide. Finally, the upper and lower slides were assembled, and the                         liquid crystals were added. We can observe the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell under                         the microscope to judge the β2–MG of the detected sample concentration.

The molecular weight changes for (b) and (c) do not appear to be obvious, however, the C18                             linkage at 37 ° C of (c) produces a certain amount of precipitation, which is not efficient.                             The acidification of the supernatant (g) in (d) serves as a purification, that is, the                             Nanobodies is separated from the supernatant, so the total protein concentration decreased                             significantly and the relative abundance of Nanobodies increased significantly.
After processing, the molecular weight of the Nanobody can be calculated to be about 18 KDa.
Nanobody concentration determination

Based on the standard curve of protein concentration and then based on the molecular weight                             of the nanobody measured by electrophoresis, we can determine the concentration of the                             Nanobody for further experiments.
We measured the absorbance of three groups of protein concentrations:
$$ y_1 = 0.520,\quad y_2 = 0.536,\quad y_3 = 0.495 \quad \mathrm{(Abs)}$$
According to the standard curve, the corresponding concentration was obtained.
$$ c_1=392.7,\quad c_2=410.9,\quad c_3=363.2 \quad \mathrm{(μg/mL)}$$
Liquid crystal verification section
We designed a liquid crystal cell as an observation supporter. First, the upper glass slide                             was modified with 0.2%DMOAP to induce the vertical alignment of the liquid crystals and make                             the optical imaging of liquid crystals appear black at the first time.Meanwhile, we modified                             the lower slide with a mixture solution of 3% (v) APTES and 1% (v) DMOAP and 1% (v) GA, so                             that it could connect to the target protein. Then We mixed the sample with the antibody and                             added it to the modified slide. Finally, the upper and lower slides were assembled, and then                             the liquid crystals were added. We could observe the optical imaging of the liquid crystals                             pool under the microsco-pe, so as to determine the concentration of β2-MG of the                             sample. The following paragraphs are the results of our investigation on the fixed antigen                             and antibody concentration, and the brightne-ss contrast of β2-MG nano-antibody                             modified by C18 and the normal β2-MG nano-antibody combined with the liquid                             crystal.
Determination of immobilized β2-MG concentration
1. Standard for immobilized β2-MG concentration
We have known that the orientation of liquid crystal molecules is very sensitive to the                             topographic changes on the substrate surface. When the β2-MG and GA are                             crosslinked and fixed on the substrate surface, the topographic structure of the surface                             will be changed to a certain extent affecting the orientation of the liquid crystal                             molecules. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of the concentration of                             immobilized β2-MG on the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell. With the                             decrease of the concentration of immobilized β2-MG, the perturbation to the                             orientation of liquid crystal molecule decreases, and the optical imaging of liquid crystal                             cell gradually darkens. Only a few speckles appear in the optical imaging of liquid crystal                             cell, which tend to be all-black background. The highest immobilized β2-MG                             concentration, which can keep the optical imaging background dark, is fixed on the substrate                             surface when sufficient antigen and antibody reactions are required.
2. Result
Keeping other conditions unchanged,the concerntration of β2-MG is in the range of 250ng/mL to 1000ng/mL,                             and the results are shown in Fig. 4.

From the experimental results, the results show when the concentration of β2-MG                             fixed to the substrate surface is under 500 ng/mL, only a few bright spots appear in the                             optical imaging of the liquid crystal cells gradually darkening, approaching the full black                             background. When the concentration of β2-MG is above 500 ng/mL, the optical                             imaging appears obvious bright spot which is becoming brighter gradually.
3. Determination of immobilized β2-MG concentration
As a result, the results show that the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell becomes                             gradually bright with the increase of the concentration of fixed β2-MG under                             other conditions unchanged. Therefore, we can determine the change trend of the brightness                             of the liquid crystal. The concentration of β2-MG increases in the same trend.                             The relationship between the luminance of liquid crystal and the concentration of                             β2-MG can be established, and then determine the corresponding concentration of β2-MG                             according to the luminance of liquid crystal, so as to achieve the purpose of quantitative                             detection. Due to the need of the experiment, the maximum immobilized β2-MG                             concentration of 500 ng/mL is selected to be fixed on the substrate surface, which can keep                             the optical imaging background dark.
Determination of the concentration of β2-MG nano antibody
1. Screening criteria for the concentration of β2-MG nano-antibody
The influence of the concentration of the nano-antibody on the optical imaging of the liquid                             crystal cell was further investigated. If we don’t add β2-MG in the sample, there                             will has color spots in the polarizing microscope imaging. When the concentration of the                             nano-antibody in the sample was low, only a few bright spots approached the full black                             background. In the subsequent detection, the substrate immobilized β2-MG will                             compete with the tested sample β2-MG to bind the limited reaction sites on the                             β2-MG nano-antibody. When the concentration of the tested β2-MG                             approaches zero (detection limit is infinitely low), the β2-MG nano-antibody will                             combine with the substrate immobilized β2-MG to disturb the orientation of the                             liquid crystal molecule to the maximum extent, resulting in the optical imaging of the                             liquid crystal cell. With the increase of the concentration of β2-MG, the binding                             of β2-MG nano-antibody to the substrate immobilized β2-MG decreases,                             and the optical imaging becomes dark from, thus completing the detection of β2-MG.
2. Results
Under the condition of 500ng/mL of β2-MG, 250ng/mL, 250ng/mL, 500ng/mL, and                             600ng/mL of β2-MG nano-antibodies were fixed on the glass slides, and the color                             and brightness changes of the liquid crystal film were compared, as shown in Fig. 5.

The results shows that when the concentration of β2-MG nano-antibody was 250                             ng/mL, the optical imaging spot of liquid crystal cell was star-shaped, whose quantity was                             more than that of the non-fixed β2-MG antibody, but the change was not obvious.                             When the concentration of β2-MG nano-antibody is above 400 ng/mL, the                             distribution of the optical imaging spot of the liquid crystal cell is similar to the                             phenomena of the concentration of β2-MG nano-antibody which is 400 ng/mL.
3. Determination of the concentration of β2-MG nano antibody
Through the experimental results, we could find that as the concentration of antibody                             increased , the crystal molecular orientation is getting more messy, and the bright spots                             gradually enhance in the optical imaging. However, 400ng/mL is the threshold of the                             concentration of β2-MG nano-antibodies. When the concentration of nano-antibodies                             increases again, the bright spots in the liquid crystal imaging did not enhance                             significantly. Therefore, the lowest antibody concentration at 400ng/mL was selected for the                             immobilization of β2-MG on the substrate surface, which could maintain the                             maximum bright spots in the optical imaging background.
Different effects of common β2-MG nano-antibodies and C18-modified                             β2-MG                             nano-antibodies on optical imaging of liquid crystal cells at the same concentration
1. Standard for the concentration of β2-MG antibody
The β2-MG nano-antibody modified by the long chain of C18 is larger than that of β2-MG                             nano-antibody. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the effects of ordinary                             β2-MG nano-antibodies and C18 long-chain modified β2-MG                             nano-antibodies on the optical imaging of liquid crystal cells.
2. Result
Under the condition of 500ng/mL of β2-MG, 250ng/mL C18 modified of β2-MG                             nano-antibodies, 250ng/mL and 400ng/mL of β2-MG nano-antibodies were fixed on the                             glass slides, and color and brightness changes of liquid crystal film were compared, as                             shown in Fig. 6.

(b) 250ng/mL β2-MG                                         nano-antibodies.                                         (c) 400ng/mL β2-MG                                         nano-antibodies
From the experimental results, fixed with the same concentration of β2-MG nano                             antibody (both with a concentration of 250ng/mL), the brightness of the liquid crystal cell                             with C18 modified β2-MG nano-antibody is higher than the threshold of normal                             nano-antibody.
3 Comparison of sensitivity between normal β2-MG nano antibody and C18 modified                             β2-MG antibody
From the experimental results, we can find that the C18 modified β2-MG                             nano-antibody has greater disturbance to the liquid crystal molecules, so we can judge that                             the sensitivity of the C18 modified β2-MG nano-antibody is higher.
Conclusion
Through experiments, we finally decided to immobilize 500ng/mL β2-MG on the                             substrate , binding with 400ng/mL β2-MG nano-antibody. In addition, we determined                             that the detection sensitivity of the antibody at β2-MG modified by C18 was                             higher. Therefore, we can detect the concentration of β2-MG in the range of                             100ng/ ml-400ng /mL (a theoretical estimate) by this method, which meets our requirements                             for the early diagnosis of nephropathy patients.
Through a series of Confirmatory experiment, we have proved that in the early stage of                             chronic                             kidney disease, our detection system can indeed reflect the changes in β2-MG                             concentration,                             which can remind users to go to the hospital for further testing.
In the future, we plan to establish a more complete back-office system, which can directly                             obtain more accurate test results based on the user's past physical indicators.
