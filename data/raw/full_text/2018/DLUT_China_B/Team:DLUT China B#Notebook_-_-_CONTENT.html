                            crystal, it is known from the search that the concentration of the antibody below 10 ng/mL
                            does
                            not affect the liquid crystal alignment, so we refer to the literature and related research.
                            It
                            is recommended by field personnel to select a concentration of 500 ng/mL as the initial
                            antibody
                            concentration for detecting the antigen. Since the amount of antigen (β<SUB>2</SUB>-MG) in
                            the urine of our
                            current patients with chronic kidney disease is 125 ng/mL in unit conversion, we hope to
                            determine the optimal antibody critical concentration by antigen concentration so that the
                            concentration is lower than 125 ng/mL. The antigen does not allow the liquid crystals to be
                            aligned in parallel, while antigens at concentrations above 125 ng/mL just align the liquid
                            crystals in parallel.</P><P>Therefore, our team selected 125 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL antigen concentrations for

                            accordingly, but the overall color was black, and the difference was not large enough
                            (Figure

                            concentration,
                            the liquid crystals could not be arranged in parallel to discolor the observation. We
                            reflect on
                            whether the concentration of DMOAP in the experiment has an interference effect on the
                            experimental results. Since DMOAP plays a role in inducing the vertical alignment of liquid
                            crystals in the experiment, the reason for the analysis may be that DMOAP leads to the
                            failure
                            to obtain ideal experimental results. So we chose 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8% DMOAP
                            concentration,
                            and the antibody concentration was still 500 ng/mL. The DMOAP concentration was different,
                            and
                            the number of bright spots in the parallel light image was different (Fig. 4). From 0.8% to
                            0.2%
                            concentration, the main body of the image is black, but the number of bright spots is
                            significantly increased. The number of bright spots is much higher at 0.2%; the number of
                            bright
                            spots on the image is less at 0.8%, which is equivalent to the previous 1%
