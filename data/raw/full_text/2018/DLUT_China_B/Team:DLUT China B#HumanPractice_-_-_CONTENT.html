                        make more patients with diabetes and hypertension recognize the dangers of the development of
                        chronic kidney disease(CKD), and help the old to prevent CKD, hypertension and diabetes early.In
                        July 2018, we held a knowledge preaching about the early prevention of CKD in Jianshan Community
                        of Dalian ,and at the same time, we distributed our brochure designed by ourselves.In a summer
                        house in the community, we distributed the brochure to some aunts,which lead them to understand
                        the dangers of kidney disease, the causes of kidney disease, and methods for preventing early
                        kidney disease. Besides, we answered many questions about diabetes and high blood pressure asked
                        by those aunts patiently. After we had a further communication with community residents by
                        interviewing them, we clearly felt that they had a deeper understanding of the dangers of CKD
                        and the importance of its early prevention,which means our practice is successful enough.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><H2 class="title">Interviews with Doctors</H2><DIV class="mainText"><P>During the summer vacation, the team members carried out practical activities throughout the
                        country and went to the hospital to interview the specialists in the kidney department. We not
                        only understand the serious situation that diabetes and hypertension cause the proportion of
                        chronic kidney disease in China to rise year by year, but also know that patients with diabetes
                        have no early and staged awareness. When patients come to the hospital for treatment, most of
                        them have obvious symptoms and enter CKD phase III, and early visits and treatments are
                        extremely important for the development of delayed kidney disease. At present, the diagnosis
                        method of the hospital is mainly blood test, but the doctor said that if a non-invasive portable
                        detection method through urine can be developed, it can not only alleviate the pain of blood
                        drawing, but also have a very high rate of early detection and treatment. In this interview, we
                        learned the importance and urgent needs of early detection in the treatment of chronic kidney
                        disease and the importance of improving the awareness of early treatment of patients, and more
                        deeply recognized the practicality and usefulness of our projects.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><H2 class="title">Product Research, Fun Marketing</H2><DIV class="mainText"><P>In order to further understand the market demand for our products, the patient's recognition of
                        products and their performance expectations for the products, we designed a questionnaire of the
                        product. And to help people understand the superiority of our products, we have designed a
                        product-based storyline, and we hope to attract more people who interest in our products in the
                        form of anthropomorphic storytelling and made our content of the project is impressive.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer"><DIV id="address"><H3> Address</H3><P>No.2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian City, Liaoning Province, P.R.C., 116024</P><H3> E-mail</H3><P>igem_dlut_china_B#163.com (Please replace # with @)</P></DIV><DIV id="follow"><H3>Follow Us</H3><DIV id="platformName"><P> WeChat</P><P> Weibo</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
