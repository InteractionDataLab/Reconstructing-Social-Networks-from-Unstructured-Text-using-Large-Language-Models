We also learned more about microfluidic device design in our interactions with Boston University’s Hardware team. In addition, we worked to help strengthen Imperial College’s Communications Strategy Guide and gained feedback on our overall strategy for the Giant Jamboree. We also worked with the Stony Brook team to provide them with cyanobacteria vectors and necessary protocols for their project this year. Please read more on our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:UC_San_Diego/Collaborations">collaborations</A> page.</LI><LI class="medalCriteria">Our team explored the importance of our project in a larger context, including a discussion about implementing our idea internationally with the TATA Institute of Genetics and Society. We also learned about the importance of sustainable design for our diagnostics platform by interacting with TIGS to gain a deeper understanding of the ASSURED criteria. We also asked some of the larger ethical questions surrounding our work including the implementation of a cell-free system and data privacy in a digital health platform.

A holistic assessment of these interactions allowed us to make crucial technical decisions and tailor our design to specifically meet stakeholder needs. Please see the entire storyline at our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:UC_San_Diego/Human_Practices">Integrated Human Practices</A> page.</LI><LI class="medalCriteria"><H4>Model</H4>Our team used exploratory machine learning in order to gain a better assessment of the in silico tool that our team had designed. It guided our project implementation because it allowed us to design disease-specific methylation probes. Our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:UC_San_Diego/Model">model</A> section of the wiki documents the foundational assumptions, data acquired, and a technical description about the theory that we were trying to accomplish.</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
