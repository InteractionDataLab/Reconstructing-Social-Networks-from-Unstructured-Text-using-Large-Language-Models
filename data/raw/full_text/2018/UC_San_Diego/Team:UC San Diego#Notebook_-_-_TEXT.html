Make 2% agarose gel with EB
Load all (20ul) of PCR product mixed with appropriate amount of loading buffer
Remember to use big combs, skip a lane between different samples if possible when load the gel: it will make gel-cutting easier

Mini Prep (Qiaprep)
Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 µl Buffer P1 and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube.
Add 250 µl Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4–6 times.
Add 350 µl Buffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4–6 times.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top microcentrifuge.
Apply 800 µl of the supernatant from step 4 to the QIAprep 2.0 spin column by pipetting.
Centrifuge for 30–60 s. Discard the flow-through.
Recommended: Wash the QIAprep 2.0 spin column by adding 0.5 ml Buffer PB and centrifuging for 30–60 s. Discard the flow-through.
Wash QIAprep 2.0 spin column by adding 0.75 ml Buffer PE and centrifuging for 30–60 s.
Discard the flow-through, and centrifuge at full speed for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer.
Place the QIAprep 2.0 column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. To elute DNA, add 50 µl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of each QIAprep 2.0 spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.
Protein Culture
Starter culture:
Add 6mL autoclaved LB into a 50mL Falcon tube, with 6uL 50mg/mL Kanamycin stock
Pick a colony from the plate using a sterile pipet tip and put into the tube
Incubated with shaking at 37 degree, stopped when you see the LB became cloudy (usually around 3 hours)
Large culture:
Pre-heated the 2L flasks with LB at 37 degree, add 750uL 50mg/mL Kanamycin stock into each flask
After the flasks warmed up, add 1.5mL starter culture into each flask
Monitor the OD600 1h, 2h and more frequent when it goes above 0.2 (usually 2h30min-4h)
Cool the flasks on ice when OD600 is approaching 0.8
Take a gel sample with 100uL culture, centrifuged at full speed for 10min at 4 degree, discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 6uL 300mM NaCl + 20mM Tris (pH = 8), add 6uL SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer
Add IPTG into each flask until 0.5mM and change the incubator to room temperature
Wait until the incubator has cooled, put the flasks in
E.coli harvest:
A gel sample after induction: take 100uL culture, centrifuged at full speed for 5min, discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 9uL 300mM NaCl + 20mM Tris (pH = 8), +3uL GLB
Clean two 250mL centrifuge bottles
Centrifuge the culture in centrifuge bottles at 8000rpm for 10min at 4 degree each time, discard the supernatant each time
E.coli cell resuspension and lysis
Resuspend the pellet in ~25mL 300mM NaCl + 20mM Tris (pH = 8), remember to thoroughly pipet up and down or vortex to resuspend the pellet into a homogenous viscous solution, transfer the final solution into a 50mL Falcon tube
Add protease inhibitor and lysozyme to the resuspension, mix thoroughly by inverting the tube several times
Take enough liquid nitrogen to soak the tube in for ~15min
DNAse
Thaw the lysate in room temperature water bath
Add DNAse with 75uL 1M MgCl2, 15uL 1M CaCl2, mix thoroughly by inverting the tube several times (should see lysate cluster together)
Put the lysate in room temperature water bath for ~1h, until less viscous (1000uL pipet can easily pipet up and down)
Take a gel sample of the lysate: 9uL lysate + 3uL GLB
Centrifuge the lysate at 10000rpm for 1h at 4 degree, separate the supernatant immediately after centrifuge
Take a gel sample from the supernatant: 9uL supernatant + 3uL GLB
Resuspend the pellet in ~5mL resuspension buffer, take a gel sample from the resuspension: 9uL resuspension + 3uL GLB
Starter Culture of mMBD-eGFP, hMBD-eGFP
6mL LB broth + 6uL 50mg/mL Kanamycin + colonies of mMBD-eGFP/hMBD-eGFP
Incubated at 37 degree with shaking
mMBD-eGFP starter culture completed in 3h: cloudy can barely see the toothpick
hMBD-eGFP starter culture remained clear: probably some problems with the plate --> redo BL21 transformation
Large Culture of mMBD-eGFP (2*750mL)
Culture + Kanamycin to final conc. Of 50ug/mL, preheated at 37 degree
1.5mL (1:500 dilution) starter culture added to each 750mL

A gel sample taken: 100uL medium centrifuged, pellet resuspended in 6uL resuspension buffer (300mM NaCl + 20mM Tris (8)), +6uL GLB
89mg IPTG (final conc. 0.5mM) added to each 750mL
Incubated at 18 degree with shaking (8:15pm)
Induction kept for 16h
Cell transformation of hMBD-eGFP (miniprep1)
An antibiotic free plate spread with 6uL 50mg/mL Kana diluted in 100uL solution, preheated at 37 degree
1uL miniprep + 50uL BL21, stored on ice for 40min
Heat shock in 42 degree water bath for 45 sec, put back onto ice
Add 300uL SOC medium, incubated in 37 degree heatblock with shaking for 1h, put back onto ice
