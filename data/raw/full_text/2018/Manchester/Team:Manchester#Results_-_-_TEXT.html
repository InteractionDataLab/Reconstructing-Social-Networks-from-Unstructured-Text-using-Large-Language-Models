Wet Lab
Designed five new BioBricks: three codon-optimised for expression of the agr quorum sensing system in E. coli and L. lactis; two to test new cross-chassis promoters.
Validated and submitted one new BioBrick to the registry.
Showed further characterisation of CP25 promoter from Jensen and Hammer, 1998
Dry Lab
Built two new models as part of the project from two stand-points:
→ Promoter optimisation tool: a valuable focused model for the iGEM community to optimise promoters when considering moving genetic parts across species
→ Agr operon model: a broader range model to give insight into how diffusion of small signalling molecules could occur in medium with unusual physical properties (cheese)
Collaborated on promoter optimisation tool internationally to provide novel promoter sequences to other iGEM teams
Human Practices
Carried out in depth literature research into recent news articles about the impact of listeriosis
Talked with relevant international industry partners on the design of our project
Investigated how Britain leaving the EU would affect the feasibility of our project through literature research and discussions with the European Commission
Carried out public engagement events to promote synthetic biology as a tool to produce safer foodstuffs
Used feedback from all human practices activities to influence the design and execution of our project
