When carrying out this type of work, researchers often wish to state their data as a measurement of fluorescence per cell. Currently, the fluorescence per cell measurement can be variable due to differences between:</P></DIV><DIV id="od600"><P>units of measurement</P><LI><P>data processing settings</P></LI><LI><P>device model</P></LI></DIV><DIV id="ilintro"><P>To find fluorescence per cell values, typically the measured fluorescence is divided by the OD<SUB>600</SUB> as an approximation of a cell number. This can also be imprecise and variable when measured on different devices. 
</P><P>The aim of the Fifth InterLab study is to make fluorescence per cell measurements more compatible among various laboratories around the world by investigating the fluorescence of eight test devices built from BioBrick parts. By standardising the protocol for the plate reader calibration with LUDOX solution, silica beads, and fluorescein, we hope to reduce variability between our results and those of other iGEM teams. OD<SUB>600</SUB> values will be associated with colony forming units (CFUs) to achieve a more accurate measurement of fluorescence per cell. </P></DIV><H2>Protocols</H2><H4> All InterLab protocols were provided by iGEM </H4><DIV class="wrapper"><BUTTON><A style="color: purple;size: 100px;" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2018/0/09/2018_InterLab_Plate_Reader_Protocol.pdf">CLICK TO VIEW</A></BUTTON></DIV><H2>Calibration</H2><H4>Calibration 1:  OD<SUB>600</SUB> Reference point - LUDOX Protocol</H4><DIV id="cal1"><P>LUDOX CL-X was used as a single reference point for the plate reader calibration. Using the correction factor obtained from the data, absorbance (Abs<SUB>600</SUB>) values from the plate reader were converted into a comparable OD<SUB>600</SUB> measurement and so the variability between path lengths was avoided. </P><P>400 μl of the LUDOX solution was added into four separate wells (100 μl each) in the 96-well plate. The same was done with 400 μl of the ddH2O. OD<SUB>600</SUB> measurements were taken and the correction factor of 3.190 was obtained, see the table with results below:</P></DIV><H4>Calibration 2: Particle Standard Curve - Microsphere Protocol</H4><DIV id="cal1"><P>Silica beads - Microsphere suspension was used to construct a standard curve of a particle concentration that was instrumental in estimating the amount of particles/cells from the OD<SUB>600</SUB> measurement.
</P><P>To prepare a Silica beads stock solution, microsphere suspension was vigorously vortexed for 30 seconds and 96 μl was quickly transferred into 1.5 ml eppendorf tube and diluted up to 1 ml with ddH<SUB>2</SUB>O. A set of ten 2-fold serial dilutions in ddH<SUB>2</SUB>O was performed.

To do that, all teams used the same fluorescein molecule to take measurements and construct a curve.
</P><P>To prepare a 10x fluorescein solution, the tube with fluorescein powder (100 μM dried down) was centrifuged for 30 s at 775 xg and resuspended in 1 ml 1x PBS. Then, 1x fluorescein stock was made by mixing 100 μl of 10x fluorescein solution with 900 μl of 1x PBS. The set of ten 2-fold serial dilutions in 1x PBS was performed.

To record the data at 6h time point, cells were grown in LB + Cam in 37°C (with shaking).</P></DIV></DIV><P>Overall, most of our results of the InterLab study are as expected. Cultures grew over the 6h period reaching the OD<SUB>600</SUB> values of 0.214 - 0.475 with an exception of the Device 5 which grew very little (OD<SUB>600</SUB> = 0.072) (Fig. 2). This might be because cells died after some time of incubation. Having more time, we could measure the cell growth over time and find the time point where the OD<SUB>600</SUB> values level off. Also, parallel to this we could transform some <I>E.coli</I> DH5 α cells with a plasmid containing only Cam resistance to see if the expression of GFP is fatal/toxic to cells. Another reason could be that the DNA plasmid of Device 5 was poor quality or had a mutation making cells less resistant to Cam. As a result, cells did not survive in LB media with antibiotic.</P><P>According to the raw fluorescence data analysis with the GraphPad Prism 7.04 software, all our samples were significantly more fluorescent after 6h of incubation than at the 0h time point including positive control being significantly more fluorescent than the negative (Table 4.). 
</P><P><B>Table 4.</B> P values were obtained after performing a paired t-test to see if samples were significantly more fluorescent after 6h incubation compared to the 0h time point. The fluorescence after 6h incubation was compared between negative and positive controls using an unpaired t-test.</P><P>Although it was unexpected that some cultures grew much slower than others, but the fluorescence/OD<SUB>600</SUB> data shows us that even with a slow growth (OD<SUB>600</SUB> (Device 1, 6h) = 0.214 or OD<SUB>600</SUB> (Device 5, 6h) = 0.072), devices 1 and 5 are no less fluorescent than, e.g., Device 4 (Fig. 3). This tells us that maybe promoters that are responsible for a GFP expression in devices 1 and 5 are stronger than in other devices.</P><P>
Also, we have performed the regression analysis test with the raw fluorescence data after 6h of incubation to test whether fluorescence measurements depend on OD<SUB>600</SUB>. We found that fluorescence does not correlate with the cell growth (Fig. 4). This fact shows us that the GFP expression is dependent on the promoter and that promoters have distinct strengths. If we had more time, we could have measured fluorescence over time (e.g. every 2h). That would show us whether the GFP expression under the same promoter depends on cell growth.
