CHEESE MAKING: MOZZARELLA
As we had the chance to speak to multiple cheesemakers ( here and here ) as part of our Human Practices , we decided it would be fun to try making our own cheese!
Ingredients
2 liters/4 pints of whole milk
¾ teaspoon of citric acid
½  teaspoon of table salt
¼ rennet tablet
Equipment Required
Glass bowl
Long knife
Large pot
Microwave
Large slotted spoon
Thermometer
Crush and dissolve ¼ of one vegetarian rennet tablet into 50 ml of boiled water that has been cooled down to room temperature
In another small bowl, mix 3/4 teaspoons of citric acid into 25 ml of boiled water that has been cooled to room temperature.
Pour 4 pints (or 2 litres) of milk into a pot. Add dissolved citric acid and stir thoroughly in an up and down motion.
Heat the milk to 32°C using medium heat. Stir often to prevent the milk from burning.
At 32°C remove milk from the heat and gently stir in the rennet solution from step 1 (about 25-30 ml) with an up and down motion for 20 seconds. Place the lid on the pot and allow to stay undisturbed for approximately 20 minutes.
The curds and whey should now have separated. The curds should look ‘solid’ and the whey will be a yellowish green liquid.
Cut the curds with a long sharp knife into small cubes. Place the pot back on the stove and heat to 40°C whilst gently moving the curds with your slotted spoon.
With the slotted spoon, transfer the curds into a microwavable bowl. Pour off as much whey as you can.
Microwave the curds on high for 1 min. Drain off any excess whey and fold and knead the hot cheese (be careful not to burn) for approximately 30 seconds. Remove as much whey as you can.
Microwave for a further 30 seconds. Add salt and fold and knead again for another 30 seconds.
Microwave for a further 30 seconds then continue to stretch and fold the hot cheese. The more you knead the cheese the firmer it will be, so make sure not to overdo it.
Once the cheese is smooth and glossy, shape it as you like! Then place it in a bowl of ice cold water for 30 min.
Store in a fridge. Mozzarella can be kept for 5-7 days before spoiling. Do not cover in water.
*protocol adapted from ‘The Big Cheese Making Kit, Mozzarella & Ricotta’; makes approx 225 g of cheese.
