Main Parts
AgrA+C - K2613741
Part BBa_K2613718 consists of strong promoter CP25 (works in both Lactococcus lactis and Esherichia coli) ( Jensen and Hammer’s 1998 paper ), RBS ( BBa_B0034 ),coding sequence agrA and agrC and terminators( BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012 ). AgrC is a transmembrane receptor histidine kinase, which detects AIP and phosphorylates/activates AgrA. AgrA is the response regulator for AgrC and drives transcription at promoter PII. AgrC and AgrA form a two-component regulatory system, which detects AIP and drives transcription at the PII promoter. In this part, AgrC has a His tag at the N-terminus to aid in protein expression detection.
AgrB+D – K2613743
Part BBa_K2613743 consists of strong promoter pTet, RBS ( BBa_B0034 ), coding sequence agrB and agrD and terminators( BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012 ). Expression of agrB and agrD is regulated by TetR. AgrB is an integral membrane protein; AgrD is a short peptide that is transported outside of the cell by AgrB. During transportation, AgrD is covalently modified to produce a small autoinducing peptide (AIP) which can be taken up by cells and induces transcription of genes under control of PII promoter.
PII - K2613740
Part BBa_K2613740 consists of amilCP reporter under control of PII promoter, RBS( BBa_B0034 ) and terminators( BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012 ). PII promoter is a promoter taken from the Listeria monocytogenes genome which is involved in quorum sensing. When activated AgrA binds to PII, Transcription can occur ( Zetzmann, M. et al. 2016 ). This means that when this device detects activated AgrA, AmilCP reporter protein is produced.
