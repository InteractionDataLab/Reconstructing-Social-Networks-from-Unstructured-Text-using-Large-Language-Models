Parts
The iGEM parts registry includes more than 20,000 BioBricks. The standardized form of BioBricks are the basis so all present and future iGEM teams can build on existing BioBricks to achieve their projects. This year we integrated more than 50 existing BioBricks into our project and we submitted more than 80 BioBricks. Further iGEM teams can realize their project by building on our BioBricks.
All of our submitted basic parts are listed in Table 1.
We are very proud of our favorite basic part BBa_K2638002 , an impressive copper importer.
The best composite of our team BBa_K2638703 is a second generation targed vector for siRNA silencing. All other composite parts are listed in table 2.
Our part improvement is a modified human ferritin BBa_K2638999 . The human ferritin was submitted by iGEM Calgary in 2013 and is an iron storage protein. We changed certain amino acid residues to add the ability to form silver and gold nanoparticles.
During our project we had to deal with gene expression, which requires a certain promoter strength. To enable a comparison of different promoter strengths, we developed a measurement vector. Furthermore, we characterized the system with our promoter-RBS library. The vector and the library are submitted as best part collection . The BioBricks are: BBa_K2638560 and BBa_K2638400 - BBa_K2638426.
