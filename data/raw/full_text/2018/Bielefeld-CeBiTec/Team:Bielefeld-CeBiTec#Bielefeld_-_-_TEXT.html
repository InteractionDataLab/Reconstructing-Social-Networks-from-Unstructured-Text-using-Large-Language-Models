Bielefeld
With its population of 325,000 inhabitants, Bielefeld is one of the 20 major cities in Germany, a large economic and cultural center in Eastern Westphalia and one of the most northeastern administrative districts in the state of North-Rhine Westphalia. Bielefeld is situated near the Teutoburger forest, which makes it attractive to everyone who likes outdoor activities. Covering approximately one-fifth of the state, Eastern Westphalia has a population of more than 2 million inhabitants. Internationally known companies like Benteler, Bertelsmann, Claas, Dr. Oetker, Gerry Weber, Gildemeister, Melitta, Miele, Schüco, and Wincor Nixdorf make it one of the economically strongest regions in Germany.
