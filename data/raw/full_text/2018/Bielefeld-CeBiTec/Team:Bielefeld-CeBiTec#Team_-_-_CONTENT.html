Joern Kalinowski's research interests are centered on the application of -omics approaches to study organisms of biotechnological as well as medical relevance. 
With a focus on genomics and transcriptomics approaches, these interests also include the genetic engineering of microbial production hosts like Corynebacterium glutamicum, 
Actinoplanes sp., and several Streptomyces strains. In additions to applying -omics methods to single organisms, he is also involved in the study of communities from 
all regions of the taxonomic tree as well as from different ecosystems. Here, there is a focus on freshwater and marine organisms and ecosystems, comprising sponges, 
corals, algae and their bacterial communities as well as viruses. With his comprehensive knowledge in the field of synthetic biology, he advises us especially 
with regards to safety and current research.
