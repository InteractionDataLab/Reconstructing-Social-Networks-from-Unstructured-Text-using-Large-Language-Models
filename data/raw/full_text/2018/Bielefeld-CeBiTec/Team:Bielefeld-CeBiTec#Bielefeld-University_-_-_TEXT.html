Bielefeld University
Bielefeld University was founded in 1969. It is known for its interdisciplinary, high-quality research and teaching. It comprises 14 faculties, covering a broad spectrum of disciplines in the humanities, natural and technical sciences, social studies and pedagogics. In the next years the new faculty of Medicine will be established and hence broadening up the interdisciplinary research profile. There are around 25,000 students, among them 2000 international students, who study in 116 different degree courses. In the next few years, the Bielefeld campus will be developed into one of the most modern campuses in Europe, offering an excellent environment for studying. The research profile of the university focuses on interdisciplinary studies. Bielefeld University is mainly known for its sociology faculty, but in recent years cutting-edge research in robotics and biotechnology became more popular. Thus, the CeBiTec has become one of the most important institutes at University.
