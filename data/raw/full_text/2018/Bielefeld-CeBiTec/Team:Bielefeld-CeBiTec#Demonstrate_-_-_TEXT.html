Demonstrate
This is nanoFactory - a combined system to clean up mining drainage and produce nanoparticles.
During our project we were able to demonstrate accumulation of metal ions in Escherichia coli, while increasing the tolerance towards such ions. We engineered ferritin to enable iron, silver and gold nanoparticle formation. Furthermore, we demonstarted that nanoparticles could be used to print conductive paths.
Achievements
1. Construction of a mutated human ferritin which is able to build silver and gold nanoparticles
2. Outreach on raising awareness on "Dual Use Research of Concern" issues in iGEM and to scientists worldwide.
3. We heterologous expressed ferritin to enhance iron nanoparticle formation in Escherichia coli.
4. Integration and characterization of metal importers to accumulate metal ions in Escherichia coli cells.
5. Cloning and characterization of several proteins which are able to reduce reactive oxygen species, for example caused by metal ions.
6. Development of a software for the prediction of siRNAs and RNAi for gene silencing in prokaryotes.
7. Development of a cross-flow bioreactor hardware to filter hugh amounts of mining drainage while accumulate metal ions in Escherichia coli.
8. Integrated modeling on toxicity through metal ions and hardware improvement.
9. Development of a siRNA target vector system for effective silencing in prokaryotes.
10. Construction of a promoter and RBS library and a testing vector to enable the comparison through normalization on a second reporter.
11. Dialogue to stakeholder and scientific experts throughout the whole project.
12. Creating achievements together with the great iGEM community.
