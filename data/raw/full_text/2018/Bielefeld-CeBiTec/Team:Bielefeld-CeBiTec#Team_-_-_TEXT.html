Meet the Team
Matthias Otto aka Despotto
Age: 25
Field of study: Molecular Biotechnology (M.Sc.)
Fun facts:
When he doesn't get enough sleep he tends to be quite bossy and likes to order people around.
Whenever he gets angry he needs a Snickers so that he doesn't become a diva.
iGEM low point/ what depressed me the most during iGEM: I tried to add a stop codon at the end of one basic part and failed multiple times because I just got colonies without the stop codon.
My iGEM highlight: The moment when I realized that the Human Ferritin has been detected in the MALDI TOF.
Irina Rais aka Irinabacter Maisi
Age: 21
Field of study: Biochemistry (B.Sc.)
Fun facts:
She is our living alarm clock as she also beeps when an alarm clock in our lab goes off.
During a python programming course we attended for our modeling Irina scripted an endless loop and incapacitated the whole servers of our facility. The programming course had to be interrupted for the day and Irina was suspended from using our facilities servers by the admins.
What depressed me the most during iGEM: Working about 3 hours on a graphic on Inkscape just to hear from Christoph WHEN IT WAS ALMOST READY that we can just take it from Wikipedia - and we took the one from Wikipedia.
My iGEM highlight: All days with good lab memes and the days I was NOT knocking out genes with CRISPR Cas/9.
Johannes Ruhnau aka Jojo
Age: 24
Field of study: Molecular Biotechnology (M.Sc.)
Fun facts:
He often sings along to pop songs on the radio in the lab.
What depressed me the most during iGEM: When the Gibson Assembly just didn't work out the way it should. Luckily I was able to solve the problem by using another cloning method.
My iGEM highlight: When several corporations were willing to support us after we visited a fair in Munich.
Antonin Lenzen aka Antonio Lenzano
Age: 22
Field of study: Molecular Biotechnology (M.Sc.)
Fun facts:
His shirts have holes everywhere: He doesn't own a single shirt that isn't torn at all.  He taped the door knop of another team member to the ceiling.
What depressed me the most during iGEM: When my IDT gene synthesis turned out to be broken.
My iGEM highlight: Meeting all the awesome people and seeing the awesome projects at the Munich European Meetup.
Christoph Geske aka Chrizzle-Shizzle
Age: 26
Field of study: Bioinformatics and Genome Research (B.Sc.)
Fun facts:
He once wanted to warm up a hard bun in the microwave and the bun started to smoke yellow. The stench was so unbearable that we had to discard the microwave.
Once he borrowed Erika's bike and when he came back he told her that she can pick it up herself – it is not his bike.
What depressed me the most during iGEM: The time we realised that our initial idea to create full sized copper nanoparticles inside the cell is not feasible and we had to make some major adjustments to the project. So glad it worked out so well in the end.
Jakob Zubek aka JAY-Z
Age: 23
Field of study: Biochemistry (B.Sc.)
Fun facts:
His mortal enemy is 50x TAE buffer.
He talks to himself aloud when he thinks he is alone.
What depressed me the most during iGEM: When the worst tube rack shacked because I stroked it a little and just threw out ALL tubes. Problematic was that the filling order on my gel was resembled by the order on the rack. I took the rack, threw it on the ground and stomped on it multiple times.
My iGEM highlight: When I expressed OprC in E.coli and they started to die in Cu(II) ion solution.
Erika Schneider aka Erik*a
Age: 24
Field of study: Genome-Based Systems Biology (M.Sc.)
Fun facts:
She thinks she can not cook and she is right as her cakes come out burned at the outside and still liquid in the center.
She often uses new methods and thinks they are better without comparing them.
What depressed me the most during iGEM: The moment I recognized I had been working with a wrong basic part all the time and all my composite parts were wrong because I used a wrong primer in my PCR and exchanged the last five aminoacids of my protein.
My iGEM highlight: When my experiments with my copper uptake system showed first positive results as it was my first entirely self-planned and -made project.
Levin Joe Klages aka Levin-Kevin
Age: 22
Field of study: Molecular Biology (B.Sc.)
Fun facts:
Levin has been called "Kevin" during iGEM because the autocorrection of some member´s mobile phone constantly changed "Levin" to "Kevin".
For his ESTA formular Levin payed 80$ instead of 14$ as he went to the wrong internet page.
What depressed me the most during iGEM: When I cut with XbaI und EcoRI and had three bands instead of one.
My iGEM highlight: The days I could sleep for more than 8 hours.
Vanessa Kraemer aka Vava
Age: 24
Field of study: Bioinformatics and Genome Research (B.Sc.)
Fun facts:
When she's sitting in front of the computer she's cursing all the time and makes pitiful sounds.
What depressed me the most during iGEM: That I forgot to add a stop codon at the end of my gene sequence.
My iGEM highlight: Finishing the animations on the front page.
Supervisor
