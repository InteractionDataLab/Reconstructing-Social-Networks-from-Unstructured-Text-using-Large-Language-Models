Experiments described in our wiki were carried out by members of the iGEM team Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2018 (see members page for details). Some very specific analyses were supported by other scientists from Bielefeld University, but executed by team members. In very few cases, we used commercial services for routine tasks like DNA synthesis, oligonucleotide synthesis or Sanger sequencing of parts ( Sequencing Core Facility , CeBiTec, Bielefeld, Germany). We would like to thank everyone who supported our project. During our research, every member of our team gained unique skills and knowledge from several experts listed below.
General Support
Prof. Dr. Jörn Kalinowski (1st PI) gave us the opportunity to participate in iGEM by providing us with our own laboratory and the resources of his working group.
Dr. Christian Rückert (2nd PI) participated in our weekly team meetings and helped us with advice and assistance.
Julian Droste (advisor), Boas Pucker (advisor), Svenja Vinke (advisor), Pascal Schmidt (advisor), Marten Linder (advisor) and Carsten Hain (advisor): Special thanks to our advisors for supporting and encouraging us to realize all our ideas.
Laura Schlüter we would like to thank her especially for her help with sponsoring questions.
Max Edich for providing helpful assists in the usage of HTML.
Markus Haak who advised us on communicating our software.
Janina Lüders we would like to thank her especially for the support conducting the panel discussion about Dual Use/Research of Concern.
Experts
Benjamin Lehner gave us advice for the printing with metal nanoparticles.
Dr. Jon Marles-Wright supported us with advice about the purification of the Ferritin protein.
Prof. Dr. José Argüello helped us a lot with good advice concerning the copper import system.
Dr. Rüdiger Gaydoul gave us expertise about waste water treatment and the cross flow reactor application system.
Prof. em. Dr. Kathryn Nixdorff supported us with a statement about Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern.
Dr. Piers Millet gave us insight about Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern in the iGEM context.
Dr. Manuela Lenzen supported us with a statement of her point of view about Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern.
Dr. Carsten Roller ,department manager training and career of VBIO, gave us a statement about Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern.
Material, Constructional and Analytical Support
The group Microbial Genomics and Biotechnology allowed us to use their laboratories and equipment and showed great patience when we occupied many of the facilities.
We would like to thank the Sequencing Core Facility at the CeBiTec for sequencing all our parts.
Marga Ferrari and Dr. Stefan Weidner supported us regarding sponsoring and administrative questions.
Prof. Dr. Andreas Hütten helped us a lot with measuring our nanoparticles. He gave us advice on producing and manufacturing the nanoparticles.
Prof. Dr. Karsten Niehaus gave us the possibility to identify the produced metal nanoparticles.
Uwe Kahmann gave us the possibility to identify the produced metal nanoparticles at a Transmission Electron Microscope.
Dr. Inga Ennen who told us how to identify our heavy metal nanoparticles on the Transmission Electron Microscope.
Timo Brändel helped us to identify the produced metal nanoparticles at a Transmission Electron Microscope.
Yannic Kerkhoff for supporting us with the image analysis of the Transmission Electron Microscope images.
Dr. Thorsten Seidel supported us by allowing us to use the fluorescent microscope.
Dr. Marcus Persicke for supporting us with the LC-MS analysis for phytochelatin assay.
Prof. Dr. Berthold Hoge , Michaela Schimmel gave us metal salts so that we could conduct several toxicity tests.
Prof. Dr. Thorsten Glaser also provided us with metal salts for our toxicity tests.
Prof. Dr. Alfred Pühler , Johanna Nelkner gave us the bacterium Pseudomonas brassicacearum which we used as a template for heterologous gene expression.
Prof. Dr. Kristian Müller supported us with lab equipment.
Dr. Michael Drobniewski works for the RAG and invited us to the mine facility Prosper-Haniel to talk to us about the water quality in the coal mines stretching over a wide area underneath North Rhine Westphalia.
Dr. Dominik Cholewa helped us much with our bioreactor modelling
Dr. Andrea Viehhauser allowed us to use the sonication device.
Thomas Schäffer helped us with the printing of our 3D model.
Dr. Stefan Hopp supported us with our toxicity modeling.
Simon Schulz and Lars Reinhardt gave us the opportunity to use a special oven to sinter our nanoparticles.
Thomas Rademacher and Hertz 87.9 helped us to produce our podcast about Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern.
Carola Eck helped us conducting our MALDI-TOF measurements.
Marina Simunovic provided us with great design ideas.
Christiane Widmann provided us with delicious muffins.
