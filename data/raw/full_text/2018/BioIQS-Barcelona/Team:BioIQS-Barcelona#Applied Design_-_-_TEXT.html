Applied Design
This page is for teams who have developed a synbio product to solve a real world problem in an elegant way. The team will have considered how well the product addresses the problem versus other potential solutions, how the product integrates or disrupts other products and processes, and how its lifecycle can more broadly impact our lives and environments in positive and negative ways.
