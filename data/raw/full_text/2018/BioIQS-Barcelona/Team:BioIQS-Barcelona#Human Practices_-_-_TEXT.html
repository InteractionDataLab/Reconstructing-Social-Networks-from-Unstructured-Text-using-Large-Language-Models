I communicate, therefore I exist
Scientific projects arise from the need to solve and face economical, technological and health-related issues, meaning that when a project comes into existence, scientists go from the problem to the answer.
However, despite keeping in mind the aim, scientists should look beyond because a project does not die when the problem is solved, it stays alive forever. Its impact remains in society. This is why, before starting, it is necessary to define who will be affected.
What is the problem you want to solve? Why?
Once you have answered these two questions, you can identify what people will be benefited from your work.
This is the beginning of a laborious and demanding pathway that requires lots of work and effort!
Now, imagine that you go to the Doctor because you are sick, but you are not able to explain what hurts you.
Do you think he could help you? Obviously not.
Communication between both parts – helper and helped – is unquestionably essential. Besides, it is a bidirectional process, i.e. the receptor understands the message and provides feedback with another message or an action. Then, receptors must listen to you, hearing is not enough. Implication of the receptor in the project is the key to success.
Communication
Words are the strongest weapon we have, but we usually forget it. This year, the BioIQS team decided to highlight the power of scientific communication for the iGEM competition.
Technicisms and misunderstandings
One of the most recognized scientist in history, Albert Einstein, said: “You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother”. That means, make it easy… but (and this is a huge but), this does not mean omitting information. Furthermore, the use of technicisms is a double-edged sword. Speakers have to adapt the message to capture public’s attention. If listeners are not familiar with the specific area of the research, try to use some metaphors and comparisons. These tips will help you to catch their attention because they will feel what you are explaining a little bit closer.
Our goals
Our communication project is addressed to the non-celiac audience. Why? Because explaining what precautions, what kind of food and what is celiac disease to chefs, waiters, and relatives of celiacs is more useful. We have also tried to show people that gluten-free food tastes as good as gluten-containing food. Are you curious about it? Have a look at our Public Engagement page.
