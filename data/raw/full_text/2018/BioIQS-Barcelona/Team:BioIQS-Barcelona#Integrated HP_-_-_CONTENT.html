The NIMA integrates food processing, gluten detection, result interpretation and data transmission, but, from the point of view of celiac people, there are a lot of characteristics missing in order for it to be the perfect one. So, in order to find its main flaws, we have to know how the detection and the food processing works (link a la part d’application design).

Another important improvement for the stakeholders would be the price reduction of our sensor compared to NIMA’s.
