The general operative basis of the method is well described above, two steps are well defined. The first one, adding the treated food. Conceptually speaking is the process where the gluten epitopes are added into the mixture if they are present in the sample. And the secondary step is ruled by the addiction of the certain amount of gluten linkers. This process rules, apparently, into a by scenario, or into a biphasic state. If there are gluten reactive epitopes to the specific HLA, there is no gold nanoparticles aggregations and the other state, where the lack of gluten epitopes leads to a massif aggregation of the nanoparticles, connecting each other by the added linkers.</P><P class="orange book block-desc">The secondary scenario is apparently a biphasic state, because the aggregation state involves itself a complex system where a given set of beads, initially isolated between them, become a global structure owing totally different characteristics and conformations. The emerging system from the interaction of the parts become the so-called concept of network. Considering that the coloration change will be observable only if the network is available to form, many questions appear about the network itself, about the components involved and the underling dynamics that will rule the whole process.</P><P class="orange book">Starting off form the basics, the firs question is: what makes, from a collection of agents (beads in this case), a network? Could be instantaneously seen, that the links between agents perform a key role on the network formation, but how do the elements that are involved in the connection phenomenon behave? How the connectivity itself affect the agent’s performance? Before answering those questions, there is a no trivial one that could be a good start to understand how the system gets connected. Which is the requirement that separates a connected system from a disconnected one. It is easy to see that a fully connected network responds to the minimal implication where, at least, all the agents are interconnected by one link, forming an interconnected hole. Yet how is the process that lead from all the free agents, at maximum entropy mixture, to a fully connected one. There is a linear process? Where the network is increasingly woven at a constant ratio. Or exist bias underlying?</P></DIV><DIV class="card-member"><DIV class="card-header" role="tab" id="heading5"><A class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordionEx1" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:BioIQS-Barcelona/Model#collapse1" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse1"><H3 class="mb-0 mt-3 title-accordion orange-intense">

The optical and spectroscopic properties of gold nano-particles have been extensively exploited for chemical, bioanalytical, and biomedical applications, in which the size controllability and surface tunability are essential (Njoki et al.). if the particles are smaller than the wavelength of the colliding haze, Rayleigh dispersion phenomena occurs. The particles are able to disperse in an easier way the blue corresponding wavelength and consequently, blue coloration is observable. These phenomena explain the blue coloration of the sky, triggered by tiny particles that are dispersing the blue light radiation.</P><P class="orange book block-desc-t">On the other hand, it must be taken in account that as tinier the size of these particles gets, their nature tents to be metallic, the dispersion phenomena previously introduced could recoil and become predominant the radiation absorption. Surface Plasmon resonance phenomena arise. It’s a matter of fact that the dispersion processes occur frequently on big size nano-particles, whereas the absorption by surface plasmon resonance occurs when the nano-particles are tinier. The change of the size in particles at nano-scale, triggers changes in the coloration very useful to build a sensor.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="card-member"><DIV class="card-header" role="tab" id="heading5"><A class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordionEx1" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:BioIQS-Barcelona/Model#collapse2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse2"><H3 class="mb-0 mt-3 title-accordion orange-intense">

The Erdös-Rényi (ER) Graph expose the basic tools to deal with the process of network formation from a complete disordered system. The foundations of the ER graph lie on the presence of nodes and exist a probability p of finding a linker joining two of them, randomly (in a full mixed state). Then the algorithm chooses a pair of agents and generates a random number between 0 and 1, η = (0,1), then if η is lower than p, a link appears in between. This model, apparently too simple it is possible to expand a model no more complex, that could explain our sensor dynamics from the basics but robust at system level. An anti-intuitively property exhibit by these network forming models is that there exists a threshold in the dynamics, that leads the system from a disconnected network (where the system remains disconnected and the connected hole doesn’t exist) to a connected one (where the system remains mostly connected and the hole contains the most). The transition from one state to the other follow a specific dynamic, that change exactly in a determined critical point that turns of the previous dynamic in order to begin the new one.</P><P class="orange book">These two states diverge from having disconnected nodes o tiny clusters of them to summarizing into a network mostly connected, or even fully connected.

The stochastic models involve noise as an intrinsic characteristic of the complex reality of the biological systems and introduce the effects of the second principle of the thermodynamics. The time step is dynamic and discrete. This stochastic model doesn’t take in account the space adopting the simplest scenario that could reproduce a robust basic behavior.</P><P class="orange book block-desc-t">The same principle as in Erdös-Rényi has been followed to built up the stochastic model. Taking two random nodes at each time stem and connecting them using an existing linker available. The giant component of the system is pursued by the red colour and will determine how connected the network at increasing the connections per node as the linkers are running out. It is important to notice that que time scale is not important in this model, the basis falls on increase the connections per node by adding linkers and follow the formation of the giant component and the general system itself.

It is important to notice that changing the union rate it would not change the intrinsic dynamics of network formation. It will affect, naturally, the fastness of the connection process between nodes but will not change the biphasic reality of the network formation or the potential number of edges per node required to change between phases and subsequently to weave the connected net, or alternatively, the fragmented one. The number of nodes or nanoparticles is, of course, a tunable parameter. Yet this aspect could not change the dynamics either. Adding more nodes will affect directly on the accuracy of the results without changing the resulting dynamics. As more nodes we could simulate the closer will be the resulting data to the pure mathematical approach and the interference related to noise will be softer.</P><P class="orange book block-desc-t">As a result, the following 3 graphs represent how the simulation using different node amount will not affects the underlying dynamic predicted mathematically above. At the same time, clear view of the biphasic nature of the connectivity of the network can be taken. As well as, could be identified the critical point that separates two well defined states. The same lecture could be extracted from the stochastically model in comparation to the mathematical approach. The connectivity of the network will not increase linearly with the increase of the average connections per node, which means that, increasing the number of HLA per node the connectivity of the hole will change the dynamic like a switch when a critical number of an average connections per node is reached. As a matter of fact, when the average connections per node is below the unit, the system tents to become fragmented, alternatively when the average connections per node overpass the criticality of the unit, the connectivity emerges for free.</P><DIV class="row justify-content-center"><DIV class="col-md-12 center"><DIV class="col-md-12 image"><P class="orange-intense book n-p smll">*The growth of the giant component while the average connections per node changes.

Nevertheless, the average connections per node will affect directly to the resulting network. Its true that a lack of linkers will preclude the connectivity of the network no matter how potential connectivity has the hole system. For this reason, the average linkers/nanoparticles must be around 1:1 at least if the full connectivity is on the search or increase this average in order to improve the availability of linkers to join the nanoparticles and solve a matter of crossing each other into the space. But it is important to remark, that adding exorbitant quantities of linker is senseless. Following the same idea, in the connected phase, as more connections the network makes, less is the improvement in connectivity terms, because they are redundant.</P><P class="orange book block-desc-t">As a matter of fact, another important lesson could be obtained, tuning the proportion of HLA per nanoparticle, the transition between phases could be driven through dynamics. In other words, a distant average HLA per node from the critical point, will lead to a fully connected network in all possible scenarios except one, when all HLA conjugated on to the nanoparticles will be blocked. The intermediate scenario where the presence of reactive epitopes is a fact but not blocks all the connectivity potential must be taken in account. That is why working with proportions of HLA per node near the criticality, will lead to a detection more accurate and the triggering eventuality between fragmented network and fully connected will be more dependent on the presence of blocking epitopes and less dependent on the free HLA.</P><P class="orange book block-desc-t">It is interesting also, that the requirements in order to achieve a full connected scenario, in terms of HLA per node or average connections per node is no superior to 3.5 – 4 units of HLA per nanoparticle. Allowing the designer to focus on this numerical framework. When we have the scenario of a disconnected network, with a final average less than 1 connections per node. The tiny clusters predominate the scenario and the giant component is no different in size to other clusters in the mixture.</P><P class="orange book block-desc-t">Take information of how the formation of clusters relates the connectivity in the network and the output of the sensor is a logical straightforward question that needs to be answered. Subsequently the construction of stochastic models taking in account the space where developed.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="card-member"><DIV class="card-header" role="tab" id="heading5"><A class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordionEx4" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:BioIQS-Barcelona/Model#collapse_11" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse_11"><H3 class="mb-0 mt-3 title-accordion orange-medium">

The collision between nodes trigger their chance of connectivity, just as in Erdös-Rényi theory, assuming definite affinity rate value. It is assumed full accessibility to linkers when two nodes collide, in order to simplify the model. Normal distribution is used to assign the HLA per bead average.

The qualitative uptake that could be obtained from the data in valuable enough to build a theoretical basis to understand the underlying dynamics of our sensor and obtain quantitative starting points to allow further on steps in the practical design of the UV-vis HLA mediated sensor.</P><H4 class="orange book block-sept">Bibliography</H4><UL><LI class="orange book">Solé, R.
