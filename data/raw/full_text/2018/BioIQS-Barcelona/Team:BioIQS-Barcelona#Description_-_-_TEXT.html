Human Practices
Our project aims to offer a real-world solution to ease celiac patient's life. Consequently, we engaged with the celiac community in an integrative way. See how the necessities of the celiac community shaped our project.
PCR standardization
The personalized gluten sensor is based on the same molecule used by the human immune system cells to detect the presence of gluten, the HLA-DQ protein .
Different variants of this protein detect different gluten epitopes. Therefore, the sensor can be personalized if it incorporates the genetic variant of the HLA-DQ protein of each patient. However, personalization often comes at a higher cost. Our team designed and characterized a standard PCR protocol that could be used to obtain the genetic variant of each user to make the personalization of the sensor feasible.
Expression system
Since our sensor is based on a human protein, the expression system of it needs to be thoroughly designed. Our team carefully studied different approaches to make possible the HLA-DQ protein expression in E. coli. Additionally, other expression hosts that can carry post-transductional modifications, such as P. pastoris, have been also considered.
We have tested and characterized these expression systems to choose which one would be used to create our sensor. See more in our composite parts page.
Detection system
We believe in the inner beauty of every project. Therefore, we are aware that the experimental work is essential, but nothing could be developed without a solid model. Our team designed a theoretical model of the sensor, which studies the detection system of our sensor. See more in our modeling page .
Collaborations
One of the most exciting things of being part of the iGEM community is the possibility to build relations with other teams from all around the world. When it comes to research, it is essential to establish collaborations. In the iGEM competition, there are several ways to share, communicate and set up a network with the community. See how we engaged with other teams in our collaborations page .
