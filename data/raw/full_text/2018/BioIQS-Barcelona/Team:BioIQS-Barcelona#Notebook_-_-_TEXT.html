Have a look!
Over the summer, the BioIQS team has compiled an account of all the work conducted. We believe it will help future iGEM generations to understand and continue our work.
In our project, we followed 3 different experimental lines:
Obtention of the HLA-DQ gene from a DNA sample of a celiac patient.
Synthetic constructs for E.coli
Synthetic constructs for P.pastoris.
Different members conducted each of these parts. To avoid misunderstandings, we kept track of the work done every week in three different notebooks.
