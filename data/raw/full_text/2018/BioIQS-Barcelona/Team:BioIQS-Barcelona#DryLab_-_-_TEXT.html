Despite what some people may think, DryLab                                 occasionally may be equal or more important for a project to develop properly than the                                 WetLab. Applying this to our project, we decided to study some important                                 aspects and evaluate their viability. More specifically, our work in the DryLab                                 consisted on:
1st: Modeling
We had several ideas about how the sensor could work, and                                 eventually, one rose up strongly. The first step is having an idea. It may seem simple, but it can take long, as it goes through                                 think about the idea, understand it and rethink it as many times as it is required. Maybe this reflection                                 seems intuitive, but constitutes the fundamental part of all                                 developments. Using mathematical models and computer simulations we have been able to                                 understand the dynamics underlying our sensor. Furthermore, using this model we can tune a huge variety of parameters,                                 test many eventualities and predict the tendency of the sensor.
Generally speaking, the bottleneck or critical working point of our idea,                                     was being able to build up a complex network of gold                                     nano-particles. This would enable our sensor to have an easy optical detection system. Understanding                                     the implications associated in that procedure makes the difference while facing the real design.                                     How can we detect the interactions between the HLA-DQ protein and gluten-derived peptides? How can this detection be easy and visual? And finally, which are the physical dynamics pervading in the system?                                     Go to the modeling section if you wish to know the answer to all this questions.

2nd: PCRs standardization
One of the strengths of our approach to detect patient-specific                                 reactive gluten peptides in food is that we can produce the sensor using only a DNA                                 sample from the saliva of the patient, which is not invasive. Patient’s HLA-DQ (the protein responsible for                                 recognizing and triggering the immune response) is then expressed using the PCR protocol designed in the WetLab. For this purpose, we use specific primers to amplify the patient’s                                 target genes and thus, it is necessary to evaluate if they will be useful for all of the                                 different celiac-associated genotypes.
A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) on all annotated                                     celiac-associated genomic sequence was performed to evaluate the conservation between genotypes of the specific                                     primer-binding regions.
The results demonstrate that this regions are perfectly                                     conserved or only slightly different for both DQ2 and DQ8 celiac haplotypes.                                     This means that either the same primer can be used for amplifying all genotypes or                                     that a specific DQ2- or DQ8-primer has to be used. The possibility to use the same primers for multiple patients reduces the costs associated in the personalization factor.                                     Thus, we've created a standard method to achieve the required personalization.

3rd: Molecular recognition
Another aspect that we wanted to evaluate is how the HLA-DQ protein                                 is able to effectively recognize and bind gluten-derived peptides. Specifically, which                                 are the residues that are mediating this recognition and if they are conserved among                                 celiac haplotypes DQ2 and DQ8.
To do so, we focused the conservation study to the residues that                                 have been previously suggested to be responsible for the peptide recognition. A multiple alignment                                 of protein amino acid sequences was performed using all the annotated HLA-DQ proteins so far.
The results demonstrate that three different residues, two in the α chain and one in                                     the β chain, are conserved among celiac patients and                                     absent in healthy people. This mutated residues strictly need to be present in the HLA-DQ protein in order to molecularly                                     recognize a gluten peptide and develop the disease. Therefore, we elucidated which are the residues of the HLA-DQ protein responsible for its interaction with the epitopes involved in celiac disease.
