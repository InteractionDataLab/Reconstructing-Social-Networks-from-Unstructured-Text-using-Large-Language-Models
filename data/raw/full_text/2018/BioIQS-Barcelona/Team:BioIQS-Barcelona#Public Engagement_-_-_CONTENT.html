                                        is stored in the genome of a single cell or in a single human body. To give
                                        sense to that large amount of data we calculated the quantity of DIN-A4 papers
                                        that would be needed in order to write all the DNA sequence of the genome of a
                                        single cell in a standard font (Courier New, 12) and standard margins. This
                                        way, everyone without biology or computation* knowledge could also imagine the
                                        quantity of information.</P><P class="orange block-sept">*(sometimes the quantity of DNA information is
                                        expressed in bytes, which is not suitable for the general population, especially
                                        older people). It turns out that a normal somatic human female cell has 2
                                        dotations of 23 chromosomes (including 2 X sex chromosomes) and mitochondrial
                                        DNA. This is a total of two times 3,088,286,401 base pairs, according to the
                                        latest human genome sequence release (GRCh38.p12). A single DINA-4 page full of
                                        characters in Courier New, 12 and standard margins could contain 2773 base
                                        pairs written on it. Therefore, to write all the information stored in the base
                                        pairs of the genome of a single human cell it would be needed to print
                                        2,186,117 pages on one face. If these pages are then piled up to form a tower
                                        (considering the height of a single paper is 0.1mm), it would be 218.61 meters
                                        tall (717.2 ft)! Just between the Agbar Tower (the taller building in our city,
                                        Barcelona; 142m) and the Eiffel Tower (324m). <A class="link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03014460.2013.807878" target="_blank">Scientists</A> have estimated that the human body contains
                                        nearly 37.2 trillions of human cells (note that this does not include the
                                        microbiota). So...to write all the information condensed in the DNA of one
                                        human body it would take a large amount of DINA-4 papers. This amount is so
                                        huge that if the papers were arranged in a straight line, the light would spend
                                        2553 years traveling from one end to the other. This is 2553 light-years long!
                                        Keep in mind that the distance from the sun to the earth is just 8.3 light-minutes, so
                                        imagine the amount of data stored in such a low volume like your body.</P><P class="orange block-sept">Using these examples, the general population can easily
                                        understand the information storage capability of DNA. Nearly everyone
                                        (including ourselves) was pretty amazed to realize how much information human
                                        bodies contain stored in DNA. After this examples, we explained that our sensor
                                        was based on a piece of information stored in two genes of the DNA. So this
                                        comparisons helped the general population to understand that DNA contains much
                                        useful information, which is different between us and that we can extract this
                                        information to create a personalized product. This helped us to explain the DNA
                                        extraction and PCR process of our project to the general population. This way, they
                                        are much better informed about the project and can have an opinion about it.
                                        Then, we integrated that informed opinion from the general population in the
                                        design of our project. Dedicating effort in explaining the projects in a simple
                                        but rigorous way can help teams to receive feedback from the target population.
                                        This feedback can be incorporated into the design of the project and hence make
                                        it more suitable for the real world.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="card-member"><DIV class="card-header" role="tab" id="heading5"><A class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordionEx5" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:BioIQS-Barcelona/Public_Engagement#collapse_02" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse_02"><H3 class="mb-0 mt-3 title-accordion orange-intense">

                                        biology into our DNA information storage workshop to expand the general
                                        population knowledge about that field. If DNA is able to compact such a large
                                        amount of data in a very small volume, why not use it as an information storage
                                        system? - would a synthetic biology scientist think. Furthermore, digital
                                        information is being generated at an increasing rate and the storage of this
                                        information requires a huge amount of servers which take up a lot of space. So
                                        why not using DNA to store digital data?</P><P class="orange block-sept">A single DNA base contains more information than one
                                        bit. DNA is made from a combination of four different nucleotide residues
                                        (A,T,C,G), while one bit can only take up to two values (0 or 1 in binary
                                        code). So one DNA base pair could contain two binary code bits of information
                                        (i.e. A=00, T=01, C=10, G=11). Therefore, theoretically, information is much
                                        more condensed in DNA than in bits.</P><P class="orange block-sept">Actually, there are still several factors making DNA
                                        information storage not as practical as current systems. However, the increase
                                        in efficiency and the drop in the cost of DNA synthesis and sequencing has
                                        dramatically increased the likelihood of using DNA as an information storage
                                        system. For this reason, <A class="link" href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6102/1628" target="_blank">Church et al, 2012</A> encoded multiple copies of the book
                                        he wrote, Regenesis, in DNA and then used next-generation sequencing to read
                                        it. Instead of using the maximum compaction system that DNA offers (2 bits per
                                        base), the authors used one bit per base (A or C for 0, G or T for 1). This has
                                        multiple advantages, one of it being avoiding extreme GC content.</P><P class="orange block-sept">To integrate synthetic biology in our DNA storage
                                        workshop we reproduced the work done by Church et al, 2012 to <A class="link" href="https://github.com/Bioiqs-iGem/dna_encoder">write our own DNA
                                        messages</A>. While the authors considered secondary structure, designed a block
                                        system to order their data from DNA and encoded words, images, and a javascript
                                        file, our system only considered GC content to write messages of a few words or
                                        mp3 files in binary code. However, our system was perfectly usable for our
                                        purpose. We created a bash script which takes a text input message and converts
                                        it to binary by the ASCII code using the xxd command. Then, using a random
                                        function, the program assigns a DNA nucleotide to each binary value (A or C to
                                        0, G or T to 1). Finally, it checks if the GC content is between the specified
                                        boundaries (by default, 40-60%). Thanks to the random function, the GC content
                                        is usually between 50%. Only when encoding single ASCII characters the program
                                        needs to perform more than one iteration to get the appropriate GC content. The
                                        generated output consists of the written message in the input format, in binary
                                        and in DNA. It also incorporates a title recreating the FASTA format used to
                                        identify the DNA sequences (and in this case, the message). The program was
                                        also adapted to convert songs in mp3 format to DNA sequences, to convert
                                        multiple text messages in the same file and to send the generated DNA messages
                                        by mail. In addition, the program displayed in a very visual way how the
                                        message was being encoded in binary and then in DNA.</P><P class="orange block-sept">We used <A class="link" href="https://github.com/Bioiqs-iGem/dna_encoder">the created program</A> to convert several short text
                                        messages about synthetic biology into DNA sequences. We then printed only this
                                        DNA sequences with their title and including a guide on how this information is
                                        encoded on the other face of the paper. We printed nearly 300 copies of the
                                        messages and gave it to students in our university. The message contained
                                        information about where to locate the DNA information workshop and an
                                        invitation to come in order to decode their DNA message.</P><P class="orange block-sept">This way, we attracted the students to the workshop,
                                        where we told them the information about natural information on DNA. In
                                        addition, we organized some other small activities related to science and
                                        celiac disease (i.e. a guess what contest, in which the participants tried to
                                        identify the content of a science picture between two possible options). All
                                        the students who came had their message decoded by us. We could quickly
                                        identify the message by its title and write down the content of the message in
                                        text format in their DNA message paper.</P><P class="orange block-sept">Finally, if the participants correctly identified more
                                        than 2 of 3 scientific pictures, we gave them the opportunity to write their
                                        own message and have it coded in DNA and sent to their mail by the program we
                                        created. Most of the messages consisted of the name of the participants and
                                        some student jokes. However, the final objective was to have fun while learning
                                        about DNA information storage, so mission accomplished!</P><P class="orange block-sept">Furthermore, it was very satisfactory for us to see
                                        the enthusiastic attitude of the students towards that workshop. It seems that
                                        most of them find special the fact of having a personal message stored in a
                                        DNA sequence which could be then synthesized, introduced to and replicated by a
                                        living organism. The program we developed based on the coding system of Church
                                        et al, 2012, helped the students to integrate into the topic by engaging on it
                                        hands on. Like the examples provided before, this section of the workshop
                                        helped translate a difficult concept in a simple but rigorous way to general
                                        population. In addition, it served us as a tool to attract people to the
                                        workshop and explain them a little bit more about iGEM, synthetic biology and
                                        our project.</P><P class="orange block-sept">You can try to convert your own written messages into DNA using our program, available in our <A class="link" href="https://github.com/Bioiqs-iGem/dna_encoder">GitHub repository</A>. To run it, you just need to download the repository as a zip file and extract its contents. Then, you should use a Unix ternimal to access the extracted folder and execute the script you need using the command &quot;bash <I>script_name.sh</I>&quot;. If you are using MacOS or Linux you can do so using the default system terminal. If you are using Windows, you will need to activate Windows Subsystem for Linux or download a Unix terminal, like the <A href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" class="link">Git Bash terminal</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="card-member"><DIV class="card-header" role="tab" id="heading6"><A class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordionEx6" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:BioIQS-Barcelona/Public_Engagement#collapse_02" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse_02"><H3 class="mb-0 mt-3 title-accordion orange-intense">
