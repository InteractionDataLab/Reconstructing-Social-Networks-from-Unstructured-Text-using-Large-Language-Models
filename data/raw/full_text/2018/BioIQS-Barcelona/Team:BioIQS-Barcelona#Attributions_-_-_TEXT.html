Roger Compte
Roger developed the fundamental idea which this project is                                     about, and consequently assessed the background and goals about the topic. Then,                                     his biggest labor in the drylab was focused on the HLA-DQ sequences extraction                                     design: primers and PCR strategy. Afterward, he performed the genomic DNA                                     extraction and designed the PCR program to amplify it and reaching the basic parts.                                     He also worked on the seting of constructs and methodologies to achieve a proper                                     functional folded HLA protein. He also helped in social events and project                                     promotion.
Júlia Quintanas
Júlia managed different tasks of the project promotion. She                                     contacted with experts and other stakeholders in order to improve the project in                                     terms of science-communication and ethics. She also worked in the launching of the                                     team presentation video and the dissemination of the crowdfunding platform.                                     Furthermore, she has participated in the organization and realization of different                                     divulgation activities to raise awareness of celiac disease and its consequences.                                     Regarding WetLab’'s part, she worked on the setting up of the PCR strategy to                                     isolate the HLA genes from genomics DNA.
Victor Maull
Victor worked on the design of the sensor with Coral from a theoretical point of view. Moreover, he developed strong theoretical background to                                     understand and predict the detection dynamics underlying the sensor. Consequently,                                     the exploration through mathematical models and computer simulations was achieved.                                     Furthermore, he lent a hand here and there, holistically speaking.
Marc Expòsit
Marc learned web development from scratch and created the wiki                                     editing tutorial examples and videos. He presented the project in multiple events                                     together with other team members. Marc loves science communication and programming,                                     so he designed and carried out the DNA information storage workshop. In the WetLab,                                     he performed the experiments to clone the basic parts in the pSB1C3 vector to register them as BioBricks. He also worked in editing the wiki and did his best to                                     coordinate the team and the progress of the project.
Mireia Solà
Mireia collaborated in the marketing tasks during the initial                                     stages of the iGEM competition, specially managing the social networks and looking                                     for possible sponsors. When executing the strategy in the laboratory, Mireia helped                                     performing the experiments as well as controlling the orders of the needed material                                     and reactives for all tasks. Finally, as other team members, she helped in the                                     poster's design for the Giant Jamboree. Without her, our Instagram wouldn't have                                     been the same!
Xavi Carol
Xavi actively participated in different parts of the project.                                     During the first stages, he was in charge of the crowdfunding campaign together                                     with Julia and Coral. Besides, he established the scientific basis of the project.                                     He was responsible for building bridges among the different members of the group as                                     well as with the IQS University. On the other hand, he focused on the design of the                                     gene extraction strategy, working hand in hand with Roger. He also was in charge to                                     establish a potential collaboration with the UPF iGEM team, to assess whether the                                     extraction strategy that they formerly designed was robust or not. He was essential                                     for the design and launch of the wiki. Finally, he prepared several speeches in                                     Bars and restaurants to clear up misunderstandings related to celiac disease, as                                     well as the final presentation for the Giant Jamboree.
Jordi Chi
Jordi was actively involved in the experimental aspect of the                                     project, from PCR primers and synthetic construct design to successfully clone one                                     of the most promising constructs for our project purpose into the desired vector.                                     He also performed the expression experiments of the cloned construct as well as                                     most of the experimental work from the InterLab Study.
Eduard Martinez
Edu designed part of the experiments usingP. pastoris.                                     Starting from primer design, to choosing the expressions vectors, protocols and the                                     expression methodology. He performed computational analysis of post traduccionals                                     modifications, disulphide bounds and HLA folding pattern. Finally, he performed the                                     designed experiments on P. pastoris and helped in other wetlab parts of the                                     project.
Coral García
Coral designed the gold nanoparticles based sensor, attending                                     Victor occasionally with the development of the drylab modelling. She was also                                     involved in the WetLab during the isolation of HLA from genomic DNA. She managed                                     the crowdfunding web page and collaborated with Xavi and Júlia in different                                     marketing tasks.
Mireia Jordà
Mireia Jordà was involved most of the time in isolating HLA from                                     the genomic DNA and helped in other experimental lab tasks. She developed the                                     scheduling for most of the divulgative events and their assistance, as well as                                     their advertisement. She also participated in artwork, including the design of the                                     poster and the banner and helped in the organization of social networks.
Aitor Vega
Aitor worked in the DryLab to assess the reproducibility of the                                     PCR for all the celiac-associated alleles and to characterize the molecular                                     interactions of the HLA-DQ-gliadin complex. He also occasionally helped in WetLab                                     tasks and in the collection and documentation of celiac disease information. As                                     other team members, he lent a hand during the last stages of Wiki implementation.
Marta Clariana
Marta contributed spreading the fundraising by different                                     channels, promoting the project to as many people as possible with the help of the                                     crowdfunding platform, in order to make our project visible to the public. She also                                     collaborated in some aspects related to marketing, such as instagram, scientific                                     divulgation, divulgation of celiac disease in bars and the DNA workshop.
Tatiana Carol
Tatiana was our web developer. She conducted all the tasks                                     related to the design of the wiki. She is such a great artist. Besides, she                                     invested much of her time to give us tips to boost our communication skills.                                     Working hand in hand with her was priceless; thanks to her, we took our programming                                     skills to a whole new level.
