Achievements of our project
1.
Computationally demonstrated that primer binding regions are perfectly conserved or slightly different for both DQ2 and DQ8 celiac haplotypes separately. This means that either the same primer can be used for amplifying all genotypes, or a specific HLA-DQ2- or HLA-DQ8-primer can be designed, reducing the cost of the sensor.
2.
Successfully designed a simple and cheap way to extract the extracellular domain of both alpha and beta chains of the HLA-DQ protein from the human genome. This would make the extraction of all HLA-DQ existing variants possible using only one protocol.
3.
Thoroughly designed and characterized multiple composite parts to ensure the correct expression of the human HLA-DQ presenting protein in a bacterial or yeast host. This would enable us to determine the best way to produce the elements needed for the sensor.
4.
Correctly cloned one of the constructs into the desired expression vector and prepared it for further expression experiments. Cloning is a tedious work and not always results as one would expect so this is an important achievement!
5.
Carefully built a theoretical model to illustrate the essential detection mechanism of the sensor. Modeling has become one of the most important jobs in this project and have allowed us to better understand the role of the sensor.
