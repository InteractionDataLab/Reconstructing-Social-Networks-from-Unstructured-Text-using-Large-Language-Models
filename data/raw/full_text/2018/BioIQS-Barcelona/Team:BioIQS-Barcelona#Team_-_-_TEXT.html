What encouraged you to compete in iGEM?
Not everyday you get the chance of building your own project with your                                 friends. Putting together basic ideas to create something bigger that could help                                 someone has been a pleasure. In addition, I am the celiac of the group so IGEM is                                 definitely made for people like me.
You could not live without..
The worst part of being celiac is to modify your own habits and even                                 worse, the ones from the people around you. What I miss the most is the typical catalan                                 bread with tomato on top.
Describe yourself in 3 words
To define myself in three words I would use pragmatic, kind and                                 versatile.
What do you do in your free-time?
I love diving, sealing and fishing. If it were up to me, my natural                                 environment would be the sea.
What do you like about synthetic biology?
The role I had in this project was to get and develop the idea for the                                 project, provide genetic material and work in the genetic extraction and purification                                 for further expression and production.
What’s your role in the BioIQS team?
The role I had in this project was to come up with the idea for the                                 project, provide the genetic material and work in the genetic extraction and                                 purification for further expression and production.
What Mireia Solà thinks about you:
If I had to describe Roger, I would say he is the reason why we enrolled                                 in the iGEM project. This is basically because he became celiac four months before we                                 first heard about this competition. He is a very positive person, friendly and very                                 intelligent. He is always willing to invite us all to his house to do some networking                                 while we make a round of beers and some pizzas.

It gave me the opportunity to develop a project designed by ourselves and                                 work with my colleagues to pull it forward.
You could not live without..
cakes, ice cream and all kinds of sweet food.
Describe yourself in 3 words
Friendly, passionate and hard-working
What do you do in your free time?
I like dancing, travelling and meeting new people. I also Iove the world                                 of furniture restoration and crafting.
What do you like about synthetic biology?
The idea of combining elements from nature so as to obtain new functions                                 that would not have been possible otherwise.
What’s your role in the BioIQS team?
Managing the different tasks of the team, disseminate and promote the                                 project as well as participate in the laboratory tasks.

What did you study?
Biological systems engineering
What encouraged you to compete in iGEM?
Marc told me about the contest when we had just begun the Bioengineering                                 master in IQS. Together with him, I started getting motivated about synthetic biology                                 and eventually engaged in the project.

PIZZA!(Obviously, a mainstream answer for a mainstream question)
Describe yourself in 3 words
Stressed, half-cynic, half-dreamer and obsessive about some topics.
What do you do in your free time?
I love leaving Barcelona’s stressful streets to go climb a mountain peak.                                 Likewise, as often as I can, I try to plan a trip as wild as I possibly can.
What do you like about synthetic biology?
Synthetic Biology is a powerful tool to understand the mechanisms                                 underlying biology. It allows us to modify life. Therefore, Richard Feynman’s words                                 acquire great sense to me: “what I cannot create, I do not understand”.
What’s your role in the BioIQS team?
My contribution is related to the development of the DryLab section of                                 our project.
What Roger Compte thinks about you:
Victor is a very charming person to be with. He is always there to help                                 you and offer a shoulder you can cry on. He is very resourceful and likes                                 problem-solving.

Sweet chocolate cookies.
Describe yourself in 3 words
Creative, hard working and curious.
What do you do in your free-time?
Trying to get people involved in projects like iGEM, creating fun but                                 stupid scripts (If you want to encode a text message into DNA, I’ve got one for you!)                                 and playing music with my band.
What do you like about synthetic biology?
Everything from synthetic life to DNA information storage, including                                 programming microorganisms in a predictive way.
What’s your role in the BioIQS team??
As team leader I worked hard to introduce iGEM to our university. I've                                 also been programming the wiki and, as I was completely new to that topic, I decided                                 making the wiki editing tutorial. I also coordinated the progress of the project and                                 prepared some activities outside the lab.
What Xavier Carol thinks about you:
I would describe Marc as a well-organized, self-disciplined and                                 resourceful scientific. He always finds a way to solve any problem.
Mireia Solà
What did you study?
I studied chemistry, although I still haven’t watched Breaking Bad.

Without pizza... “Crazy Telepizza Tuesday” has become a ritual.
Describe yourself in 3 words
I would describe myself as a lively, friendly and impulsive person.
What do you do in your free time?
I love doing sport, specially running and climbing mountains. In winter,                                 skiing is just the perfect plan for the weekend, although I always try to have time to                                 hang out with my friends.
What do you like about synthetic biology?
What fascinates me the most about synthetic biology is how we are able to                                 redesign new artificial pathways using microorganism as our own machines.
What’s your role in the BioIQS team?
My role in the project has mainly been managing the social networks,                                 specially Instagram as well as taking photos and videos of our daily work in the                                 laboratoy.
What Mireia Jordà thinks about you:
She is a perfectionist. The laboratory journal is her most precious gem.                                 She is a runner and so she spends most of her day up and down the stairs to get                                 everything you need.
Xavier Carol Morera
What did you study?
I’ve read a lot of things about something called proteins.
What encouraged you to compete in iGEM?
I wanted to extend my knowledge related to team-managing to a whole new                                 level.

The potential it has to solve real life problems by genetically modyifing                                 microorganisms.
What’s your role in the BioIQS team?
My responsibilities refer to the design of the experiments related to the                                 molecular biology field. I also care about the content of the wiki.
What Victor Maull thinks about you:
Xavi is a highly committed, efficient and methodical person. I have to                                 say that he owns great artistic taste and radiates such inner peace that is hard to                                 beat! Undoubtedly, it has really been a pleasure to have known him during the last                                 year. To sum it all up, I consider him a person to learn from.

What Coral thinks about you:
Edu is that kind of person that everyone loves. Most of the time he can                                 be pretty annoying, but in the end, he is adorable (and you will never understand why).                                 He is hard-working, and super competitive, but we can say he is a really good friend                                 (out of the lab).
Coral García
What did you study?
Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (yes… the science of tiny things).

What do you like about synthetic biology?
I’m still wondering what synthetic biology is… I think the best point is                                 that it is endless, there are no limits to this area of research.
What’s your role in the BioIQS team?
A bit of everything… Lab work, communication activities, sensor design...
What Aitor thinks about you:
Coral is the one person everybody wants to work with. She is always the                                 first to finish her tasks and help you out if you need a helping hand. You have great                                 chances to find her reading a book in some corner.
Mireia Jordà

I decided to participate because it is a great opportunity to improve                                 collaborative work skills as well as to face new and inspirational challenges.
You could not live without..
Candy. Contrary to people belief, candy is not normally labelled as                                 ‘gluten free’ due to possible cross-contaminations during manufacturing. A life with no                                 candy is much blander.
Describe yourself in 3 words
I’m passionate, spontaneous and very clumsy.
What do you do in your free time?

What do you like about synthetic biology?
What I like the most is that it makes scientists able to solve real world                                 issues by genetically modifying living organisms.
What’s your role in the BioIQS team?
I have been in charge of the bioinformatical aspects of the project.
What Marc thinks about you:
Aitor is always fighting for his ideals and discussing current topics.                                 When he is not outraged for some political scandal, he is fascinated by autonomous                                 robots, artificial intelligence, new technological gadgets and superheroes. Coupling                                 this interest with his bioinformatic knowledge, one day he might create one of his                                 favourite heroes from the Avengers…who knows.
Marta Clariana
What did you study?

What do you like about synthetic biology?
The fact that you can produce improved products with important                                 applications by just mixing parts from the DNA of different organisms.
What’s your role in the BioIQS team?
Mainly, I’ve been part of the marketing team.
What Júlia thinks about you:
Marta is a nice and sociable person. She is always taking care of our                                 celiac fellow (Roger). In addition, she is the chef of our group, her gluten free                                 chocolate cake is delicious. Can’t wait to try it again!
