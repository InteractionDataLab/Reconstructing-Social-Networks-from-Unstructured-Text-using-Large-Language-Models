01. Interview with Dr. Luo.
In order to better solve the problems that other teams had raised in CCiC, the difficulties we encountered                     in the process of experiments, and the significance and prospects of the project, we decided to interview                     Professor Yunzi Luo, a researcher at the State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy of Sichuan University.                     Dr. Luo is mainly engaged in the research of synthetic biology, molecular biology and biochemistry,                     and carries out research on the bioactive molecules excavation, biosynthesis mechanism and efficient production.                     As she was the instructor of previous iGEM team, we hoped to get practical advice and solutions to the problem from her.
02. Interview with Dr. Huang
Dr. Fei Huang is the chairman of a biology company who is in a long-term cooperation with SCU_iGEM as                     a consultant. When we were previewing and having defense for our projects, Dr. Huang expressed his                     interest in the project about using CRISPR system to adjust and control the process of indigo production                     and dying. After the defense, we acquired that Dr. Huang also had a project related to indigo, so we                     consulted him about the potential problems our system might have. And since he is familiar with the                     industrial application of biotechnology and the production process of biological products, we also                     asked him about the possibility of using our CRISPR system in the industrial production of indigo.
