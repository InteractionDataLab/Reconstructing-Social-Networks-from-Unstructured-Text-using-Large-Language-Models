Inspired by the modularization, call-and-return and do-not-reinvent-the-wheel philosophy in                     computer programming design, we come up with the idea of using the dCas9 protein to manipulate                     the expression of proteins and implement complex logic in a single E. coli cell this year. we                     want to construct versatile “library strains” that contains many, and maybe redundant coding                     sequences of commonly used proteins which are dormant by default; when we need to use the function                     of particular already coded proteins, we just simply transform a much smaller “Minimid” containing                     sgDNAs targeting the desired proteins into the library strain, and then utilizing the dCas9-sgRNA                     complex to initiate the transcription then expression of the particular protein.
To show the power and practicality of the design above, our team aims to test the system by using                     fluorescent proteins and apply it to a sustainable dyeing strategy. Indigo, as a current widely used                     dye, its production, transportation and using employs many toxic and not environment-friendly chemicals.                     However, the enzymes that catalyze the relevant reactions are found and the biological solution seems                     promising. We design a strategy that not only circumvents the use of toxic reagents for indigo chemical                     synthesis but also removes the need for a reducing agent for dye solubilization. Our engineered E.coli                     will be transformed with the above proteins and become a manipulatable library for us. This project                     will provide a fundamental contribution to the construction of engineering bacteria and clean manufacturing.
