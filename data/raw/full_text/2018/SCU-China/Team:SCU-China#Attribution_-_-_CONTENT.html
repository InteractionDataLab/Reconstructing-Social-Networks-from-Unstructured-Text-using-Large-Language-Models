                </DIV></DIV><DIV class="phrase"><DIV class="subtitle">About Us</DIV>
                    We started to prepare for 2018 iGEM a few weeks after the 2017 iGEM. Team leader, vice team leader and group leaders and reserved team members were determined at that time. We held a short training lasting for almost one week at the beginning of winter holiday with the help of our instructors and the college. Brainstorms were held to come up with our new project during the training. Two parts of our project, CRISPR system and indigo synthesis namely, were presented at this time. During the Spring semester, we held project analysis for several times to learn from other teams. ACMA was successfully held as well. General project frame was determined in May with the help of our teachers, advisors, as well as previous iGEMers. Experiments were done from July to October.
                    
                    Details of our winter training will also be introduced to you here.
                    
                    Winter training was held a few days after Fall semester. In a training lasting for one week, teachers and speakers will present the basic ideas and knowledge related to molecular biology and synthetic biology. It was our great honor to invite professor Yang Zhang to address several talks related to plant synthetic biology. Laboratory safety was also be emphasized. Considering the short time of winter training, we didn’t prepare experiments as before this year. Timetable of this year’s winter training is shown in figure 1. Students in winter training mainly are reserved team member selected before. The training is not obligated to reserved team members. Though our materials are not available to all students in our college, people who are not in our reserved team but want to participate the training is welcomed. Training material is totally available to them, too. Students will be grouped before the training, including people who are not in our reserved team. Brainstorms were held every night based on groups. On the last day, we will hold project defense to show our primary ideas about project. During this year’s final defense, we held a live on www.bilibili.com and invited team members from Shandong to watch it.
                    <DIV class="showimg">Figure 1. Timetable</DIV>
                    From Marth to June, we held group meeting almost every week to study the outstanding projects in 2017 iGEM. Students were required to do presentations in the group meetings to help themselves understand the design and experiments, and A comprehensive test was used to determine the team member and reversed team member in this year. Experiments were started in July and continued to the last day before wiki freeze, with human practice and collaboration keeping in line with it.
                    
                    Thanks to the attempts at standardizing team structure did by former SCU-China iGEMers and the help of our instructors and college, we generally form an inheriting structure, though it may cause that we have many team members every year. After a whole year’s competition, several junior students become group leaders who take control of the team organization, experiments and so on. Most sophomores in the team are developed form the reversed team member in the last year and they become the main part of our team if they determine to remain and pass the test mentioned above. Freshmen were encouraged to participated in winter training and were required to attend the group meetings. Experiments were mainly completed by juniors and sophomores while human practice was mainly accomplished by freshmen under the leadership of senior grades students.
                    
                    Nowadays, SCU-China is not just an iGEM team but also a platform for students in Sichuan University to practice the experimental skills, to learn and understand the synthetic biology, to work together and to complete the project designed by ourselves. With the encourage of college, our education parts of human practice become easier to accomplish (see human practice). By integrating the competition into undergraduate education of college, we receive the great support from our Life Science College every year and we sincerely hope such a kind of team structure organization idea would help new team to find their suitable road, especially teams who met obstacles on dealing with financial or other problems with their colleges.
