In this section, we use cell-free expression to produce StarCore proteins.
Cell-free expression was indispensable for this project, because the proteins we are making are inherently toxic to bacteria. Our cell-free expression platform also allowed us to produce and screen many constructs quickly, without the intermediate step of bacterial transformation.</P></DIV><DIV class="textbody h1"><H1>Results</H1></DIV><DIV class="textbody h2"><H2>Expression of the StarCore Fusion Proteins</H2></DIV><DIV class="textbody"><P>StarCore fusion proteins were expressed using the myTXTL Sigma 70 Master Mix Kit, generously provided by our team sponsor, Arbor Biosciences. As an expression vector, we used pACYCDuet-1 from Novagen. This vector is widely used for protein production in strains of E. coli that express T7 polymerase such as BL21 (DE3). It contains a T7 promoter upstream of a strong RBS and a lac operator, allowing IPTG-controllable protein expression.
To express from the T7 promoter, it was necessary to first produce T7 polymerase in the cell-free extract. For this purpose, we used the plasmid P70a-T7rnap, supplied by the manufacturer. We also included 100 uM IPTG in the master mix, to relieve lac repression.
Cell-free extracts were assayed for the presence of StarCore proteins by a variety of methods, described in the Characterization page. Unfortunately, none of these assayes produced evidence of successful protein expression and this despite our tests with the same constructs encoding eGFP instead of our StarCore. </P></DIV><DIV class="textbody table tr td"><TABLE boarder="5" cellpassing="0" cellpadding="12" width="500"><TBODY><TR><TH allign="center">Box 1: Why are StarCore Proteins Difficult to Express?</TH></TR><TR><TD><P>Although our cell-free mix performed well for expression of GFP controls, we were not able to achieve sufficient yields of StarCore proteins.

The Bioneer company generously offered to sponsor us by giving us access to their ExiProgen™automated protein synthesis platform. This is a fully automated system that takes synthetic DNA as input and performs cell-free expression and protein purification. </P><P>Like us, Bioneer found most of the StarCore constructs to be difficult to clone, express and purify. However, thanks to their efforts we were able to obtain 11 StarCore proteins at high yield whose expected masses were compared to those observed on gels to verify plasmid designs and transformations (see the “Design” part). </P></DIV><DIV class="textbody span"><B>Figure 1 StarCore proteins can be expressed and purified.</B>Team sponsor Bioneer provided us this compound image of an SDS-PAGE gel with his-tag purified StarCore proteins.

</DIV><DIV class="textbody h1"><H1>Discussion</H1></DIV><DIV class="textbody"><P>Using the cell-free system in collaboration, we successfully obtained 11 StarCore proteins. The expression system produced StarCores and these proteins were run on protein gels and the protein concentration was determined using a nanodrop. Successively, these proteins were then transferred to the Testing group to determine their killing efficacy on the test bacterium.  In future, one needs to improve the efficiency of protein expression permitting multi-utility. </P></DIV><DIV class="textbody h1"><H1>Methods</H1></DIV><DIV class="textbody h2"><H2>Cell-Free Mix Preparation</H2></DIV><DIV class="textbody"><P>Cell free expression was performed using the myTXTL Sigma 70 Master Mix Kit (Arbor Biosciences, #507024).</P><P>Following Sun et al., (2013), we also prepared our own cell-free lysate to test the relative efficacy of the commercial extract.
