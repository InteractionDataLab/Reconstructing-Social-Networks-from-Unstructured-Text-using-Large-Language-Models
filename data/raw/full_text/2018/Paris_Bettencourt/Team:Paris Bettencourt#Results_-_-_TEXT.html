Key Results
Key results from the Human Practices
By talking to experts, farmers and veterinaries, we identified that antimicrobial resistance of coliforms affecting piglets is a major concern
We obtained access to raw data from ANSES and found out that this data highlights amoxicillin and tetracycline as drugs with the most frequent evolved resistance
Key results from the STAR CORE Design and Production
We successfully cloned 131 STAR CORE combinations.
9 out of the 11 proteins we expressed exhibited antibacterial activity comparable to existing antibiotics and AMPs.
Key results from the Testing
The STAR CORE we have obtained show antimicrobial activity.
8 out of the 10 constructs showed antimicrobial activity towards E. coli while 9 out of the 10 constructs displayed antimicrobial potential towards B. subtilis.
The top performing STAR CORE was the Ferritin-Alyteserin fusion, with an activity almost 10 times higher than that of the control. Some StarCores exhibited species-specific killing, being particularly active against E. coli.
StarCores of varying geometry displayed similar MIC values.
There was no clear correlation between the geometry of the STAR CORE and their antimicrobial activity, indicating a non-specific mechanism of action.
Key results from Optimization and Modeling
Decreasing net charge on the peptide improves expression efficiency, however it decreases its antibacterial activity
