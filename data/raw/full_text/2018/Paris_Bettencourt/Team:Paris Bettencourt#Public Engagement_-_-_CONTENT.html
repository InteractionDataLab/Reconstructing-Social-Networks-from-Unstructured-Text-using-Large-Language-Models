Every day was a perfect day on this farm, as all the animals were happy, healthy and lived in the middle of a beautiful environment.</P></DIV><DIV class="textbody"><P>But one day, Maksim’s smile vanished. He started losing his appetite and slowly his energy. Little Maksim looked so unwell that the farmers called the veterinarian.</P></DIV><DIV class="textbody"><P>The veterinarian ran some tests and upon diagnosis, it was found that Maksim was infected by a multi drug resistant Colibacillus, which could be fatal to him!Poor Maksim!</P><P>Hearing this story, Paris Bettencourt iGEM team jumped into action!</P><P>They wanted to save Maksim and to do so they need everyone’s aid!</P></DIV><DIV class="textbody h2"><H2 id="Maksim-the-piglet-VR-experience">Maksim the piglet VR experience</H2></DIV><DIV class="textbody"><P>Multidrug resistance is a crisis plaguing both developed and developing nations and to create awareness among people, we developed our very own <EM>“Maksim the Piglet”</EM>.</P><P>It is an interactive VR game experience, aimed to generate curiosity as well as educate the masses.</P><P>To make the VR experience realistic, logistically, the game was set-up inside a container, divided two parts- one half displays the work carried out at Institut Cochin by our iGEM team and the second half, contained a pen for our piglet Maksim, where the attendees could hear poor Maksim suffer as a result of the illness.</P></DIV><DIV class="textbody"><P>The audience is briefly introduced to the concept of antibiotic resistance- our role as iGEMERs to design other alternatives to antibiotics and their role as judicious users of antibiotics. Thereafter, the attendees are invited to wear a “full body lab suit”. Followed by providing them with arsenals the “pipette-guns”, we shrink to them to “microscale” and where they enter Maksim’s colon.</P></DIV><DIV class="textbody h2"><H2 id="Introduction">Biofaction filmed us at Biodesign Here Now 2018!</H2></DIV><DIV class="textbody"><P>This is where the fight would begin to save our poor baby Maksim from this fatal infection!</P><P>Like all mammals, piglet’s like Makism is inhabited by millions of bacteria both good and bad. Thus, each player has to avoid killing the good bacteria found in Maksim’s colon.</P></DIV><DIV class="textbody"><P>The winning strategy is use antibiotics sufficiently to cure the infection and not indiscriminately.

            Creating Maksim-the Piglet has been quite an emotional and inspiring journey for us, and we started from scratch with the help of <EM>Gamelab</EM> and <EM>VR Lab</EM> housed at  <EM>CRI</EM> in Paris.
        </LI><LI>
            The VR experience was constructed using  <EM>Unity</EM> for the <EM>HTC Vive</EM> hardware.
        </LI><LI>
            We added the special sound effects of samples recorded in our lab to really immerse the audience in the ambience of a wetlab (See iGEM Bettencourt Paris- Music Makers).
        </LI><LI>
            The key figure behind the game is our developer and game-designer Mourdjen Bari, and Philippe Llerena and the CRI Gamelab provided the logistical resources.

Our rigorous and through search led us to Francois-Xavier de Seze, from <EM>Sparkling VR Paris</EM>, who not only lent us their installation but also invited us to develop our game at their complex whenever needed. We received love and support from them!</P></DIV><DIV class="textbody img"><P>Our game was further ameliorated by the creativity strokes of the 3D artist Salamiden, who designed our fantastic, real-looking antibiotic-pipette guns and the bacterial cells.</P></DIV><DIV class="textbody"><P>At London Design Week, we met Wim Van Eck, a researcher and artist who works on biological 3D modeling. His artistic process involves growing bacteria and fungi on Petri dishes, scanning them and building a height-field to displace a 3D grid object to create a 3D terrain.
