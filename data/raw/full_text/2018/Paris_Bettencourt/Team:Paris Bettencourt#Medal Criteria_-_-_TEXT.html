Poster and presentation are prepared for the Giant Jamboree Judging form: https://igem.org/2018_Judging_Form?id=2738
We attributed the respective members and external mentors that helped us in our project: https://2018.igem.org/Team:Paris_Bettencourt/Attributions
We characterized biobrick BBa_I20270 via our mini-interlab cell-free: https://2018.igem.org/Team:Paris_Bettencourt/Collaborations
We also participated successfully in the INTERLAB experiment  https://2018.igem.org/Team:Paris_Bettencourt/InterLab
Silver medal requirements
We designed, submitted and validated a Biobrick: BBa_K2738006  https://2018.igem.org/Team:Paris_Bettencourt/BioBricks
We designed, submitted and validated a Biobrick: BBa_K2738006  https://2018.igem.org/Team:Paris_Bettencourt/BioBricks
We did a mini cell-free interlab experiment with iGEM GIFU team
We collaborated with team Tubingen for deimmunization of our StarCores
Human practices:https://2018.igem.org/Team:Paris_Bettencourt/Human_Practices
We thought about the concept and application of our project by conducting interviews with experts in research and policy makers to understand the problem of antibiotic resistance in relation to intestinal infections in piglets.
Gold medal requirements
We Integrated human practices into our project to study the current scenario of antibiotic resistance in pigs and in improving awareness among the people in France: https://2018.igem.org/Team:Paris_Bettencourt/Human_Practices
We improved a part (BBa_K2444003) and submitted the improved version (BBa_K2738104)
Modelling: https://2018.igem.org/Team:Paris_Bettencourt/Model  We applied machine learning to model antimicrobial effect of peptides. Using homology modelling we predicted the structures of StarCores and performed molecular dynamics to estimate their stability.
