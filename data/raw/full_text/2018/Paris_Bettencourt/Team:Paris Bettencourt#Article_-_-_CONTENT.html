Piglets have an immature and developing immune system. They inherit their mothers' vaginal flora, and presence of resistant bacteria from the mother could colonize the newborn upon delivery. 
     &lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;step&quot;&gt;</PRE><DIV class="title">Benoit Quero, veterinarian and mayor of Plumeliau, Brittany, France)</DIV><PRE>     &quot;Antimicrobial resistance is a major challenge not only for animal health, but also for human health. Indeed, many pathogenic bacteria are common to humans and animals, and the same families of antibiotics are therefore used in veterinary medicine and human medicine...&quot;
     &lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;step&quot;&gt;</PRE><DIV class="title">A race against time</DIV><PRE>     Veterinarians have an arsenal of antibiotics at their disposal. Their use is methodical and gradual, especially since ANSES, a French national public health security agency, recommends reducing the prescription of antibiotics to limit the emergence of resistance. Here are the differents families of antibiotics (colours) to treats piglet digestive pathologies. PORC 2017 - E.coliÂ : sensitivity to different tested antibiotics (N=780 piglets) - J.-Y.

     &lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;step&quot;&gt;</PRE><DIV class="title">The symptomatic case of Amoxicillin</DIV><PRE>       Veterinarians have many antibiotics available, but Escherichia coli are increasingly becoming resistant. Often, the first antibiotic prescribed to treat digestive disorders in piglets is amoxicillin. It is an inexpensive and easy-to-administer antibiotic,  effective against several types of pathogenic bacteria, such as E.coli or Clostridium spps. In many cases, it solves the problem without unduly weakening the animals. Indiscriminate use has made E. coli highly resistant to amoxicillin (59%). However, this antibiotic continues to be used regularly due to its low cost and overall effectiveness. E. coli sensitivity to amoxicillin is falling dramatically, as it is very widely prescribed.
     &lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;step&quot;&gt;</PRE><DIV class="title">Tetracycline resistance is also another concern</DIV><PRE>       It is generally not prescribed to cure  digestive disorders, but rather to treat respiratory diseases. However, its use causes collateral Damage: treatment of respiratory diseases with tetracycline in piglets causes the development of resistant strains of E.coli in the digestive system (66% resistance rate).Additionally, resistant strains that emerge in the digestive system of animals are very easily found in the environment, via feces, where they can contaminate other animals or transmit their resistance genes to other bacteria. It is therefore understood that there is a need for an extensive and continuous antimicrobial resistance surveillance network. In France, this network is called the Resapath network. It consists of more than 70 laboratories, which perform more than 50,000 antibiotic susceptibility tests each year.

The prescription of some antibiotics, considered and classified as Drugs of Last Resort (higlighted in red) , is restricted by law.
