PURIFICATION PROTOCOLS
Note
Read IMPORTANT NOTES on p.3 before starting.
All purification steps ahould be carried out at room temperature.
All centrifugations should be carried out in a table-top microcentrifuge at >12000 x g (10000-14000 rpm, depending on the rotor type).
Protocol A. DNA purification using centrifuge
Step
Procedure
1
Add a 1:1 volume of Binding Buffer to completed PCR mixture (e.g. for every 100 µL of Binding Buffer). Mix thoroughly. Check the color of the solution. A yellow color indicates an optimal pH for DNA binding. If the color of the solution is orange or violet, add 10 µL of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 solution and mix. The color of the mix will become yellow.
2
for DNA ≥500 bp
Optional: if the DNA fragment is ≥ 500 bp, add a 1:2 volume of 100% isopropanol (e.g., 100 µL of isopropanol should be added to 100 µL of PCR mixture combined with 100 µL of Binding Buffer). Mix thoroughly.
Note. If PCR mixture contains primer-dimers, purification without isopropanol is recommended. However, the yield of the target DNA fragment will be lower.
3
Transfer up to 800 µL of the solution from step 1 (or optional step 2) to the GeneJET purification column. Centrifuge for 30-60 s. Discard the flow-through.
Note. If the total volume exceeds 800 µL, the solution can be added to the column in stages. After the addition of 800 µL of solution, centrifuge the column for 30-60 s and discard flow-through. Repeat until the entire solution has been added to the column membrane.
Close the bag with GeneJET Purification Columns tightly after each use!
4
Add a 700 µL of Wash Buffer (diluted with the ethanol as described on p.3) to the GeneJET purification column. Centrifuge for 30-60 s.
Discard the flow-through and place the purification column back into the collection tube.
5
Centrifuge the empty GeneJET purification column for an additional 1 min to completely remove any residual wash buffer.
Note. This step is essential as the presence of residual ethanol in the DNA sample may inhibit subsequent reactions.
6
Transfer the GeneJET purification column to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (not included).
Add 50 µL of Elution Buffer to the center of the GeneJET purification column membrane and centrifuge for 1 min.
Note.
For low DNA amounts the elution volumes can be reduced to increase DNA concentration. An elution volume between 20-50 µL does not significantly reduce the DNA yield. However, elution volumes less than 10 µL are not recommended.
If DNA fragment is > 10 kb, prewarm Elution Buffer to 65 °C before applying to column.
If the elution volume is 10 µL and DNA amount is ≥5 µg, incubate column for 1 min at room temperature before centrifugation.
7
Discard the GeneJET purification column and store the purified DNA at -20 °C.

Growth of Bacterial Cultures
Pick a single colony from a freshly streaked selective plate to inoculate 1-5 mL of LB medium supplemented with the appropriate selection antibiotic. Incubate for 12-16 hours at 37 °C while shaking at 200-250 rpm. Use a tube or flask with a volume of least 4 times the culture volume.
Havest the bacterial culture by centrifugation at 8000 rpm (6800 x g) in a microcentrifuge for 2 min at room temperature. Decant the supernetant and remove all remaining medium.
Do not overload the column:
For high-copy-number plasmids (see Table 1), do not process more than 5 mL of bacterial culture. If more than 5 mL of such a culture are processed, the GeneJET spin column capacity (20 μL of dsDNA) will be exceeded and no increase in plasmid yield will be obtained.
For low-copy-number plasmids (see Table 1), it may be necessary to process larger volumes of bacterial culture (up to 10 mL) to recover a sufficient quantity of DNA.

PURIFICATION PROTOCOLS
Note
Read IMPORTANT NOTES on p.3 before starting.
All purification steps should be carried out at room temperature.
All centrifugations should be carried out in a table-top microcentrifuge at >12000 x g (10000-14000 rpm, depending on the rotor type).
Use 1-5 mL of E. coli culture in LB media for purification of higt-copy plasmids.
For low-copy plasmids use up to 10 mL of culture.
Protocol A. Plasmid DNA purification using centrifuges
Step
Procedure
1
Resuspend the pelleted cells in 250 μL of the Resuspension Solution. Transfer the cell suspension to a microcentrifuge tube. The bacteria should be resuspended completely by vortexing or pipetting up and down until no cell clumps remain.
Note. Ensure RNase A has been added to the Resuspension Solution (as describe on p.3)
2
Add 250 μL of the Lysis Solution and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear.
Note. Do not vortex to avoid shearing of chromosomal DNA. Do not incubate for more than 5 min to avoid denaturation of supercoiled plasmid DNA.
3
Add 350 μL of the Neutralization Solution and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times.
Note. It is important to mix thoroughly and gently after the addition of the Neutralization Solution to avoid localized precipitation of bacterial cell debris.
The neutralized bacterial lysate should become cloudy.
4
Centrifuge for 5 min to pellet cell debris and chromosomal DNA.
5
Transfer the supernatant to the supplied GeneJET spin column by decanting or pipetting. Avoid disturbing or transferring the white prepipitate.
Note. Close the bag with GeneJET Spin Columns tightly after each use!
6
Centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the column back into the same collection tube.
Note. Do not add bleach to the flow-through, see p.8 for Safety Information.
7
for EndA+ strains only
Optional: use this preliminary washing step only if EndA+ strains which have high level of nuclease activity are used.
Wash the GeneJET spin column by adding 500 μL of Wash Solution I (#R1611, diluted)
8
Add 500 μL of Wash Solution (diluted with ethanol prior to first use as described on p.3) to the GeneJET spin column. Centriifuge for 30-60 seconds and discard the flow-through. Place the column back into the same collection tube.
9
Repeat the wash procedure (step 8) using 500 μL of the Wash Solution.
10
Discard the flow-trough and centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual Wash Solution. This step is essential to avoid residual ethanol in plasmid preps.
11
Transfer the GeneJET spin column into a fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (not included). Add 50 μL of the Elution Buffer to the center of GeneJET spin column membrane to elute the plasmid DNA. Take care not to contact the membrane with the pipette tip. Incubate for 2 min at room temperature and centrifuge for 2 min.
Note. An additional elution step (optional) with Elution Buffer or water will recover residual DNA from the membrane and increase the overall yield by 10-20%
For elution of plasmids or cosmids >20 kb, prewarm Elution Buffer to 70 °C before applying to silica membrane.
12
Discard the column and store the purified plasmid DNA at -20 °C.

Add H2O to fill up to desired reaction volume. Incubate                                         ligation at 37°C for 1 h prior to heat inactivation at 80°C for 15 minutes.
