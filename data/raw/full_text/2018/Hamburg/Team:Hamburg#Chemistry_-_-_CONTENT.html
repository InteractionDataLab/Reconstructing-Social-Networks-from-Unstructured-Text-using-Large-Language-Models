                        Chemistry
                    </H1><P><EM>E. coli</EM> colonies producing lactic acid as an attractant for mosquitos are an
                        important aspect of the realization of our project. However, these colonies
                        are encapsulated in alginate beads which are acid-labile and hence
                        endangered by a pH value that is too low. In order to ensure the long-term
                        stability of these beads therefore biosafety we investigated their
                        stability in the presence of different concentrations of lactic acid over
                        time. For this reason we developed a fast and easy photometric method to
                        monitor their decomposition.

                        Under stirring 12.6 mg Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 were dissolved in 200
                        mL water for 1 h. Afterwards, 2.00 g sodium alginate were added. After
                        heating and further stirring a homogenous solution was obtained. This
                        solution was dropped in defined amounts into a solution of 2.00 g calcium
                        chloride dihydrate in 200 mL water. This resulted in the formation of
                        colored beads with a similar size distribution (Fig. 1).

                        For the concentrations of lactic acids we decided to begin with an aqueous
                        solution containing 40% lactic acid and half this until we reached a
                        solution containing 0.31% lactic acid. Additionally, we set up a negative
                        control containing just water and a positive control containing 0.5 M
                        hydrochloric acid.
                    </P><P>
                        We added 50 beads to each solution and stored them for two weeks at room
                        temperature.
                    </P><H2>
                        Alginate capsules are stable in light acidic conditions.
                    </H2><P>
                        After two weeks we examined the constitution of the alginate beads (Fig.
                        2). Since a significant discoloration occurred in the two most concentrated
                        set ups, the beads are not as easy to identify as it is for the other
                        concentrations. Nevertheless, the beads are still intact after two weeks
                        even when they had been exposed to non-natural high concentrations of
                        lactic acid. By this, the study suggests that the stability of the alginate
                        gel and therefore biosafety can be ensured since no decomposition was found
                        for concentrations of lactic acid within the concentration of cellular
                        metabolites.

                        A key element of our trap is represented by the hydrogel embodying a border
                        between the environment and the trap’s insides guaranteeing an undamaged
                        surface due to its self-healing properties. Therefore, there are several
                        requirements that need to be fulfilled by this gel. The hydrogel we chose
                        can not only be obtained readily but can also be handled easily. Since its
                        viscosity decreases above 55 °C it enables a casting into the desired form
                        when it is hot resulting in a stable gel after it cooled to ambient
                        temperature. Equipped with these characteristics the hydrogel offers a
                        suitable surface on which mosquitos can land.

                        The gel is synthesized in a polymerization between the two bifunctional
                        monomers pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) and 4,4’-oxydianiline (ODA) in    <EM>N</EM>,<EM>N</EM>-dimethyl acetamide (DMAc) resulting in a poly(amic
                        acid) polymer (PAA). The reaction is carried out at room temperature and
                        occurs spontaneously without catalysis. Treating this PAA polymer with
                        triethylamine (TEA) converts it into the corresponding a poly(amic acid)
                        ammonium salt (PAS) (Fig. 3).

                        By pouring the reaction mixture into acetone the more polar environment
                        forces the PAS polymer to agglomerate in order to cover the hydrophobic
                        regions. After washing with acetone and drying the salt in vacuum, a
                        yellowish powder is obtained. This PAS powder is stirred in water and
                        gently heated resulting in the adjustable ready-to-use hydrogel. After it

                        There are three non-covalent interactions that contribute to the mechanical
                        strength, the thermosensitivity, the no maintainance aspect and are
                        therefore crucial for the gel’s self-healing properties (Figure 2).

                        The amide functionality is able to serve as a hydrogen donor as well as an
                        acceptor. For this, a hydrogen bond between an oxygen atom of one strand
                        and a hydrogen atom of the amide functionality of another strand is formed.
                        Due to the aromatic character in the repetetive motif of the polymer, the
                        chains are able to interact trough π-π-stacking, in a similar fashion as
                        the bases of DNA. Ultimately, through its ionic character
                        polyanion-polycation interactions occur between the chains. Although all
                        these interactions are accorded to be weak interactions, in sum they
                        promote stability and regenerative abilities to the polymer. As a result of
                        this a reptation and reentanglement of the polymer chains across a fracture
                        interface causes the healing of the gel in the case of damage<A id="page-reference-2" href="#reference-1" class="reference" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true" data-placement="top" title="Zhang, L., Wu, J., Sun, N., Zhang, X. &amp; Jiang, L.
