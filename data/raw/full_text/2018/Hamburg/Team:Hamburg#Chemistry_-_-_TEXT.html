E. coli colonies producing lactic acid as an attractant for mosquitos are an                         important aspect of the realization of our project. However, these colonies                         are encapsulated in alginate beads which are acid-labile and hence                         endangered by a pH value that is too low. In order to ensure the long-term                         stability of these beads therefore biosafety we investigated their                         stability in the presence of different concentrations of lactic acid over                         time. For this reason we developed a fast and easy photometric method to                         monitor their decomposition.
Alginate capsule production
Under stirring 12.6 mg Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 were dissolved in 200                         mL water for 1 h. Afterwards, 2.00 g sodium alginate were added. After                         heating and further stirring a homogenous solution was obtained. This                         solution was dropped in defined amounts into a solution of 2.00 g calcium                         chloride dihydrate in 200 mL water. This resulted in the formation of                         colored beads with a similar size distribution (Fig. 1).

For the concentrations of lactic acids we decided to begin with an aqueous                         solution containing 40% lactic acid and half this until we reached a                         solution containing 0.31% lactic acid. Additionally, we set up a negative                         control containing just water and a positive control containing 0.5 M                         hydrochloric acid.
We added 50 beads to each solution and stored them for two weeks at room                         temperature.
Alginate capsules are stable in light acidic conditions.
After two weeks we examined the constitution of the alginate beads (Fig.                         2). Since a significant discoloration occurred in the two most concentrated                         set ups, the beads are not as easy to identify as it is for the other                         concentrations. Nevertheless, the beads are still intact after two weeks                         even when they had been exposed to non-natural high concentrations of                         lactic acid. By this, the study suggests that the stability of the alginate                         gel and therefore biosafety can be ensured since no decomposition was found                         for concentrations of lactic acid within the concentration of cellular                         metabolites.

Hydrogel
A key element of our trap is represented by the hydrogel embodying a border                         between the environment and the trap’s insides guaranteeing an undamaged                         surface due to its self-healing properties. Therefore, there are several                         requirements that need to be fulfilled by this gel. The hydrogel we chose can not only be obtained readily but can also be handled easily. Since its                         viscosity decreases above 55 °C it enables a casting into the desired form                         when it is hot resulting in a stable gel after it cooled to ambient                         temperature. Equipped with these characteristics the hydrogel offers a                         suitable surface on which mosquitos can land.
The gel is synthesized in a polymerization between the two bifunctional                         monomers pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) and 4,4’-oxydianiline (ODA) in N,N-dimethyl acetamide (DMAc) resulting in a poly(amic                         acid) polymer (PAA). The reaction is carried out at room temperature and                         occurs spontaneously without catalysis. Treating this PAA polymer with                         triethylamine (TEA) converts it into the corresponding a poly(amic acid)                         ammonium salt (PAS) (Fig. 3).

By pouring the reaction mixture into acetone the more polar environment                         forces the PAS polymer to agglomerate in order to cover the hydrophobic                         regions. After washing with acetone and drying the salt in vacuum, a                         yellowish powder is obtained. This PAS powder is stirred in water and                         gently heated resulting in the adjustable ready-to-use hydrogel. After it                         is poured into the desired shape (Figure 1) it is stored at 5 °C for one                         week 1 .

Self-healing properties
There are three non-covalent interactions that contribute to the mechanical                         strength, the thermosensitivity, the no maintainance aspect and are                         therefore crucial for the gel’s self-healing properties (Figure 2).
The amide functionality is able to serve as a hydrogen donor as well as an                         acceptor. For this, a hydrogen bond between an oxygen atom of one strand                         and a hydrogen atom of the amide functionality of another strand is formed.                         Due to the aromatic character in the repetetive motif of the polymer, the                         chains are able to interact trough π-π-stacking, in a similar fashion as                         the bases of DNA. Ultimately, through its ionic character polyanion-polycation interactions occur between the chains. Although all                         these interactions are accorded to be weak interactions, in sum they                         promote stability and regenerative abilities to the polymer. As a result of                         this a reptation and reentanglement of the polymer chains across a fracture                         interface causes the healing of the gel in the case of damage 1 .

Synthetic procedure
To a solution of 2.41 g ODA (11.0 mmol, 1.00 eq.) in 43.0 mL DMAc 2.61 g                         PMDA (11.0 mmol, 1.00 eq.) were added stirred for 4 h at room temperature.                         Afterwards, 3.34 mL triethylamine (24.4 mmol, 2.03 eq.) were added and the                         solution stirred for additional 2 h. In the following, the reaction mixture                         was poured into 200 mL acetone and the precipitated solid crushed and dried in vacuum until no further change in its mass was                         detected. To 4.51 g of the obtained PAS powder 30.0 mL deionized water were                         added. The resulting mushy solid was stirred for 2 h at 60 °C and then                         poured into a culture dish. After additional heating for 30 min at 50 °C                         the gel was stored for 7 days at 5 °C.
