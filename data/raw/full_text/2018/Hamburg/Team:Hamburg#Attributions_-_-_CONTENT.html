She is professor for biochemistry at the University of Hamburg and an expert on tRNAs. Zoya has the amazing talent to give helpful advice on whatever topic we discuss while giving us total freedom in project development, design and execution. Her unique approach makes iGEM the learning experience it is designed to be. With great patience Zoya lets us make our own choices. By founding an iGEM team at our university she gave generations of students the amazing opportunity to grow far above what the usual curriculum teaches, enabling us to develop such an extensive and ambitious project.</P><H3>Andreas Czech</H3><P>Andreas is our secondary Principal Investigator. He was always helpful and supported us with helpful advice every time we were confronted with problems, even on his days off and on weekends. Thanks to his dedicated way to advise us, members without any laboratory experience were able to adapt quickly. He furthermore supported us in the process of organizing our experiments and our laboratory equipment. We are very thankful for his help and support.</P><H3>Frank-Olaf Lohmann</H3><P>Frank is our team psychologist. As psychology student he helped us a lot by organizing our team and building our team spirit. He was there for us whenever we needed his diplomatic advice. He was our mediator when conflict arose and taught us how to notice and prevent emerging conflicts. Thanks to him we were able to grow not only on a professional but also on a personal, social level.</P><H3>Henning Jacobsen</H3><P>Henning is an Advisor of our Team. He was the team leader of the first iGEM Team of the University of Hamburg, Flu Fighters in 2015. He advised us how to plan a project and organize a team, and with his wide network, also helped to find sponsors. Although he is not a regular team member and did not work in the lab physically he was available day and night for questions and problems.</P><H3>Shanti Ricke</H3><P>As a former iGEM team leader Shanti helped us in various parts of the project along the way. Although he was really busy with his bachelor’s thesis he always made time for us and supported our work in the lab as well as our sponsoring acquisition with helpful information. He also advised us on how to deal with different problems relating new cloning methods and iGEM deadlines. He really made effort in the beginning of this iGEM year to introduce this great competition to our newbies and refired our old-established members’ passion for iGEM.</P><H2>Partners</H2><P>We thank our partners outside iGEM:</P><H3>Thomas Jacobs</H3><P>For hosting us at the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for tropical medicine and providing us with mosquitoes as well as advice for the experimental design of our Demonstrate experiments.</P><H3>Mathias Riehn</H3><P>For his support and help during the mosquito experiments at the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for tropical medicine.</P><H3>Daniel Wilson</H3><P>For his advice and support in experimental design and letting us use his groups lab equipment.</P><H3>Mirko Himmel</H3><P>For his advice regarding biosafety, which led us to reconsider and change significant aspects of our project.</P><H3>Wolfgang Maison</H3><P>For letting us perform chemical experiments and syntheses in his lab.</P><H3>Ingrid Goebel</H3><P>For guiding us whenever we needed help at finding lab materials, using lab devices and giving us advice on Dos and Don’ts in the lab.</P><H2>Former Members</H2><P>Nina Kähler</P><P>Jana Ketzel</P><P>We thank you for your contribution to the project and wish you the best success for your future endeavours.
