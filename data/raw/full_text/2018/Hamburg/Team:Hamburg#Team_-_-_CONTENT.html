                                I participated at iGEM in 2016 for the first time with our project <I>Finding Chlamydory</I>. In 2017, I acted as an Advisor for Team Hamburg. This year, I decided to again do my best to make the world a better place, and dove right into the next iGEM project. This time, fighting the most deadly disease there is – exciting stuff. Having accumulated two years of iGEM experience, I am very happy to share everything I learned with my team, and in turn continue to learn new things every day. iGEM is so diverse, I could possibly do nothing but iGEM and still grow with every project. But this is the last time. I promise…

                                My interest in the field of synthetic biology and the field’s creative possibilities initially made me participate in iGEM 2016. Over the course of the competition year, I was able to learn far more than lab work - how to develop an idea into a real world application, interdisciplinary collaboration, science communication and much more. This led me to participate again in iGEM 2018, this time using my experiences to lead and organize the team with the goal of contributing to the fight against malaria with our innovation. And I am still learning new skills, new points of view and new solution approaches.

Since my first own little project in school, I am keen to work in interdisciplinary teams. Working on our iGEM project means learning about the essence of science. Science is not just working in the lab, rather it is passion to conduct experiments and draw the consequences, passion to organize and plan, passion to tweak and reevaluate your own thoughts.

                                I always felt the desire to create something new, to help the people and save the world with my inventions. When I first heard of iGEM I thought my friend was kidding, because it seemed too perfect to be true. Young naive students with innovative ideas creating their own project and working in the lab all by themselves. From second one I was into it! Every week we faced new challenges and liked the idea of being part of the solution. iGEM gives me the space to make my childhood dreams become reality.

From designing a project from scratch and financing to human practices, this is such a massive task. I love to challenge myself and iGEM is definitely the right place to do so.

                                Engineering is a broad topic. Engineering something genetically is definitely none of my specialties. While a particular genetically altered thing may be a breakthrough, it still needs a physical application in some cases though. Understandably, that is not generally a specialty of genetic engineers and where my basic knowledge of manufacturing and other parts of mechanical engineering were demanded in our case.
                                Working on this big project is definitely something different to programming, structural analysis and load analytics. It is something for a change where actual creativity is required beyond the usual considerations.
