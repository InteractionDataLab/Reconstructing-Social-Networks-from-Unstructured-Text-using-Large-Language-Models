Only infected circulating red blood cells can be detected and destroyed. The most characteristic symptoms of a malaria infection are flu-like symptoms. Patients have paroxysms of fever, headaches, chills and other common indications.

In the early 20th century DDT was used as insecticide. Today we know about the health risks of such insecticides. To prevent side effects and to design a more effective device we designed the S.H.I.E.L.D.</P><P>Malaria is known all over the world which is partly due to the fact that it used to be prevalent in countries that are not tropical. Even in the cold of northern germany malaria was a common disease and led to repeated local epidemics just one hundred years ago. Today malaria is found nearly solely in poor regions of southern Africa (90 % of all cases worldwide 2016), south-east Asia (7 %) and Mediterranean Americas (3 %). In these regions over 216 million cases were reported in 2016. A number that’s still growing. Reasons for this are for these staggering numbers are among others poor infrastructure, humanitarian crises, natural disasters and a low economic growth rate.</P><P>The WHO reported that about 80 % of all deaths from malaria occur in only 15 countries in 2017. The WHO is now focusing their efforts on these countries. These efforts include the supply of medication like vaccines, antimalarial drugs -especially for children and artemisinin-based combination therapy.</P><P>Furthermore they are working on (re-)build the local health care institutions, or to pass out bed nets and insecticides in order to prevent the transmission of malaria<A id="page-reference-1" href="#reference-1" class="reference" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true" data-placement="top" title="WHO.

The S.H.I.E.L.D. could be an important part of a solution for this problem. By luring and killing the vectors the S.H.I.E.L.D. can contribute greatly to stopping the transmission of malaria. While the whole population would benefit from this it is of special importance to high risk groups such as children under 5 years and pregnant women who cannot take most malaria medications.

Since it works for extended periods of time without needing maintenance the S.H.I.E.L.D. is especially suited for regions with poor infrastructure. The S.H.I.E.L.D.’s design consists of several integral parts.

In addition to stabilizing the culture it provides an important biosafety feature as it would prevent uncontrolled proliferation in case of damage to the S.H.I.E.L.D.</P><H2>What makes S.H.I.E.L.D. special?</H2><P>A hydrogel covers the lower part of the S.H.I.E.L.D. It covers the compartment containing <EM>E. coli</EM> and provides a surface for mosquitoes to land on and subsequently sting into. By using a secretion modul and an outer membrane protease the attractants and the toxin are excreted into the hydrogel. The mosquitoes have to land on and sting into the gel to ingest the toxin. The self-healing properties of the hydrogel ensure its integrity after mosquitoes sting into it.</P><P>The barrier created by the hydrogel between the GMOs and the environment is further extended by a nanofilter. Its small pore size allow small molecules like the toxin and bait to pass through it while at the same time preventing bacteria from entering or escaping from the S.H.I.E.L.D. Combining all of the parts mentioned above we created a device singularly suited to fulfill one of today's important worldwide challenges - combating malaria. </P><H2>References</H2><OL><LI id="reference-1"><A href="#page-reference-1">↑</A><A target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/">WHO.
