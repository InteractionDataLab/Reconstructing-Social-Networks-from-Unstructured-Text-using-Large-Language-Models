She hopes to broaden her knowledge of the subjects and expand her interests. While Sarah is not in the lab, she is either reading, playing her guitar, or learning more about her other interests: French, history, and math. Sarah also does advanced ceramics in school and hopes to continue the subject in college next fall. Sarah is very passionate about her hobbies, and strives to learn as much as possible about as much as possible. Sarah’s passion for learning has found a home at RAIN, where she can learn and experiment as much as she pleases.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="cd-member-bio member-2"><DIV class="cd-bio-content"><H1>Meet Kira Boyce</H1><P>A senior at Charles Wright Academy, Kira hopes to utilize her lab experience taken from RAIN by applying it to her own research this coming school year. She aspires to become a biomedical engineer and is always looking for a way to bring the team closer together. She is very passionate about music, cooking, and running, all of which she constantly tries to incorporate into her work at RAIN.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="cd-member-bio member-3"><DIV class="cd-bio-content"><H1>Meet Ian Gutierrez</H1><P>Ian is a senior at Stadium High School and does Running Start at Tacoma Community College.

Professionally and academically, Jaskiran’s interests lie in the field of bioengineering as it pertains to her natural curiosity towards understanding how things work in an interdisciplinary manner. Jaskiran hopes to delve into the sciences throughout college - this includes finding and learning from experiences within and surrounding STEM. After joining iGEM in the beginning of 2018, Jaskiran learned about the lab processes involved in cloning and now applies them to her work in the lab. She has gained many skills from spending hours in the lab and hopes to use these skills in her future research-oriented endeavors. Jaskiran also works on the Human Practices team, in which she works with other team members to find ways to spread awareness about who the Tacoma RainMakers are and what they do. Besides participating on the iGEM team, Jaskiran also loves to dance, contribute to her school community and spend time with friends and family. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="cd-member-bio member-7"><DIV class="cd-bio-content"><H1>Meet Leon Wan</H1><P> Leon is a senior at Steilacoom High School who prefers to spend his time reading, being physically active, and eating.
