            Date: May 24th，2018
When choosing the disease to apply our project, we initially decided to target at liver cancer. In order to understand current treatment of liver cancer, we interviewed Director Zhou Guoping of Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. Director Zhou Guoping has decades of clinical experience in the treatment of liver cancer. He introduced us to the situation of liver cancer in China, the characteristics of liver cancer and treatment methods. The interview excerpt is as following.

		Q：We understand that most patients with liver cancer are already in the advanced stage when they are diagnosed. Is it true in your experience? Does this mean that most patients with liver cancer are difficult to cure and they have been sentenced to death?
 A: The incidence of liver cancer has always been very high in our country, especially in men. Because of the high incidence of hepatitis B in China, the incidence of liver cancer is relatively high. Liver cancer in China has a lot to do with hepatitis B. When someone is diagnosed with liver cancer, the mortality rate is really high. It is rare for the patients to be diagnosed with small tumor which means the diameter of the tumor is less than 3cm. The survival rate of patients with small tumor generally is quite high. However, they are often diagnosed at the middle or advanced stages. The cancer can bring many other problems, such as ascites, jaundice, etc. which causes difficulties in treatment. At present, the best treatment for liver cancer is surgery, but most people can not undergo the surgery.

Q：What kind of treatment is currently used in clinical practice?
A: Because most patients lose their chance of surgery, and the recurrence rate of this kind of cancer is really high. At present, chemotherapy is commonly used. The chemotherapy efficiency of liver cancer in the past is very poor. In the last two years, it was slightly improved due to technology improvement. In addition there are embolization treatment and targeted therapy, such as sorafenib. However, according to the score system we use now, in fact, the use of sorafenib in the advanced stage have barely any effects, like a comfort treatment. However, sorafenib is still the drug of first choice for advanced treatment.

Q：What are the characteristics of liver cancer compared to other cancers?
A: Liver cancer cells are active and invasive, and there are rich sinusoids surround them. So the liver cancer cells can easily invade the capsule and blood vessels, resulting in easy local spread of the tumor, bloody metastasis. To a certain extent, for the liver is the main metabolic organ, the impaired liver function affects metabolism greatly. The side effects of taking medicine can be greater than others.

Q：What do you think of gene therapy for liver cancer? Is it promising for our RNAi strategy to be applied?
A：There is no mature gene therapy for liver cancer till now. However, we still need new treatment methods for liver cancer. If you have done quite well in your experiments, it will be really promising. The high specificity could reduce the side effects greatly, which is very significant.

			In this interview, Director Zhou help us to understand the difficulties and features of the treatment in liver cancer. Then he expressed his expectation to our project. He said that clinically, advanced liver cancer lacks more effective targeted drugs. Although the traditional therapy has been improving, but it does not turn out well. He strongly encourages us to try to apply our ideas in the treatment of liver cancer.

This started with our interview with several experts in this field.  Based on their suggestions, we then tried to add a mathematical model to simulate the progression of liver cancer and the cost-effectiveness of our product.  And we have drawn up a business plan to summarize the points we considered of the entrepreneurship of our project.(Tips:Please Click On Our Title TO See Our <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2018/c/cb/T--CPU_CHINA--hp-shangyejihuashu.pdf">Entrepreneurship_Proposal</A> )

Professor Yongjun Liu is an MBA supervisor at Nanjing University, graduate supervisor in Pharmaco-Economics at China Pharmaceutical University and was a visiting scholar at North Carolina State University.  He also manages an investment company here located in Nanjing.  He is experienced in industrial economics research.  Professor Liu’s team is currently promoting CAR-T therapy for solid tumors, including liver cancer.
We interviewed Professor Liu on campus on June 25th
Topics include:

            Q: What do you think are the economic characteristics of modern gene therapy and biological therapy?
A: They are expensive but can be very effective.  One must judge a product by both its price and its effect.  To fully consider this, a cost-benefit analysis is sometimes necessary.  For example, if a drug can prolong the patient’s survival time by three years while another can do ten years, it makes such a great difference for the patient that even if the latter product is much more expensive, he/her would probably still favor it.  As for the affordability, modern biologics’ prices are getting lower and lower each year as the technology is improving so fast, medical insurance system also adapting, so I guess we shouldn’t consider this as a significant problem.

            Q: How do you choose projects for investment?
A: We try to avoid projects that are too popular when selecting projects for investment.
During the interview, we also asked about the future of genetic drugs.  Professor Liu affirmed the prospect of synthetic biology and showed enthusiasm towards the future development of genetic drugs.  Currently gene therapy has only been applied in rare diseases or lymphomas and there remains a big gap for genetic drugs to be ever used against solid tumors.  This project shows our effort toward filling such a gap and in theory it is a promising strategy for the treatment of liver cancer.

            <P><A id="4" onclick="turnToNext2(this.id)">[Read more]</A><A id="-4" onclick="turnBack2(this.id)">[Backwards]</A></P></DIV><DIV id="club-txt5" class="club-txt" style="text-align:left;font-size:1.2em;"><B>What did we learn?</B>
The pharmaceutical industry tends to avoid investing in over-popular products as to reduce the intensity of competition and to keep the profits as big as possible.  This indicates that newly-developed, investment-seeking projects need to be unique and innovative.<P><A id="5" onclick="turnToNext2(this.id)">[Read more]</A><A id="-5" onclick="turnBack2(this.id)">[Backwards]</A></P></DIV><DIV id="club-txt6" class="club-txt" style="text-align:left;font-size:1.2em;">
            As a matter of fact, our project has been retrofitted to the possible side effects of canonical RNA interference and has adopted a new target, which is at the forefront of current gene therapy.
Professor Liu also told us that it is very important to look at the market and competitors when evaluating our own project, during which adjustments should be made according to the current demand of the market. 
            <P><A id="6" onclick="turnToNext2(this.id)">[Read more]</A><A id="-6" onclick="turnBack2(this.id)">[Backwards]</A></P></DIV><DIV id="club-txt7" class="club-txt" style="text-align:left;font-size:1.2em;"><B>What did we add?</B>
Indeed, only by conducting a complete cost-effectiveness analysis can we evaluate whether the project would be cost-effective.  It also would allow us to have a deeper understanding of the current situation of liver cancer treatment.  Therefore, we decided to establish a mathematical model to summarize several existing liver cancer drugs and to set up a reasonable price range for our project.<P><A id="7" onclick="turnToNext2(this.id)">[Read more]</A><A id="-7" onclick="turnBack2(this.id)">[Backwards]</A></P></DIV><DIV id="club-txt8" class="club-txt" style="text-align:left;font-size:1.2em;">According to Professor Liu's suggestion, it is critical to improve the project towards the market’s demand.  Only projects that are accepted by the market are worthwhile for further development.  Therefore, we needed to systematically identify our own strengths through the comparison with existing drugs.

Interviewing the entrepreneurial tutor Pengbo Shang 
In the process of writing a business plan, we interviewed the entrepreneurial tutor Pengbo Shang.  Pengbo Shang is the deputy secretary of the China Education Innovation School-Enterprise Alliance (Production Alliance).  He’s also a career coach of Tsinghua University and a Distinguished Research Fellow of London Business School.  He himself has been engaged in health care and medical device industry for more than ten years.

            Since currently no genetic drug is available for the treatment of liver cancer, we found it difficult to make a reference when analyzing the market.  In the interview, Professor Shang told us that we should instead focus on the existing chemotherapies and make comparison with them.  We can also analyze the general situation of genetic drugs, from which we can learn about patients receiving such drugs (their feedback, etc.) and the general market.  By summarizing the information, we would still be able to somehow predict our products’ development in the market.

             At the same time, he emphasizes that timing is the key when it comes to medical products.  We need to carefully consider the time required for every step (research, clinical trials, marketing, etc.) and include them in the scheme.  The consequential timetable then becomes an important item for investors to evaluate the efficiency of our team.  To attract great market share, we would also want to make the development cycle as short as possible.<P><A id="11" onclick="turnToNext2(this.id)">[Read more]</A><A id="-11" onclick="turnBack2(this.id)">[Backwards]</A></P></DIV><DIV id="club-txt12" class="club-txt" style="text-align:left;font-size:1.2em;">
            The second stop is the venue of molecular biology. In this level, you can engage in Dodgeball of gene. Choose a theme, then knock the uncorrelated cups down with a ball. For example, in transcription theme, there are seven cups marked with telomerase, enhancer, promoter and so on. So you need to knock down the cups labeled with telomerase.

            Now, we arrive at outdoor venue of the biochemistry theme. There are two tasks, Draw something and Bio-hopscotch, that you need to accomplish. Draw something is the game that one person draw some required biochemical terms like t-RNA, chromosome, and the other guess what the picture is. One who paints can't speak or write any words. Bio-hopscotch test the gamer's knowledge of biochemical reactions. You can choose lower difficulty of Draw something for five questions to match higher difficulty of Bio-hopscotch of glycolysis and Kreb's cycle. Or higher difficulty of Draw something for eight questions match lower difficulty of Bio-hopscotch of Hatch-Slack Cycle. This outdoor activity also attracted many passersby to engage in it.

We completed the business plan in which we conducted an analysis of the market as well as possible competitors and a cost-effectiveness analysis.  We understood how high-tech products could stand out from the liver cancer drug market, and saw some unexpected strength and potential of our project.

	To truly understand how our project could be of benefit to patients, we got in touch with the biggest cancer patients’ community of Southeast China: the Nanjing Cancer Rehabilitation Association.  We joined one of their events and communicated with the patients.
Nanjing Cancer Rehabilitation Association is a non-profit organization composed of cancer patients and volunteers.  Currently there are 9,668 registered members in the association.  Regular activities include lectures given by professionals and Sharing Circles during which members of this association share their experience with the disease.  Those who are of better health even provide counseling services for other patients.

		<P><A id="1" onclick="turnToNext3(this.id)">[Read more]</A></P></DIV><DIV id="patients-txt2" class="patients-txt" style="text-align:left;font-size:1.2em;">
	On September 19th, Huandi Xu, Hongyu Wang and Yunge Lou went to Baima Park, Nanjing to join an event held by patients who regained their health from cancer.  Talented members prepared entertainments for everyone.  Several people shared their stories of fighting against cancer.
One of the patients we interviewed, a Mr. Liu, received novel therapy during the 90s and luckily survived all these years.  As a beneficiary of the bio-therapy, he really inspired us and helped us to compassionately feel the significance of new treatments.

		<P><A id="2" onclick="turnToNext3(this.id)">[Read more]</A><A id="-2" onclick="turnBack3(this.id)">[Backwards]</A></P></DIV><DIV id="patients-txt3" class="patients-txt" style="text-align:left;font-size:1.2em;">
	Mr. Liu was diagnosed with gastric cancer in 1995 and received resection immediately.  However, six months after that the cancer was found to have metastasized to his liver.  Even worse, the cancer cells soon spread among the two liver lobes and made it impossible to perform surgery.
He sought treatment in several different hospitals but most of the doctors were pessimistic enough to suggest that he give up.  But he didn’t.  At last he heard that there was a new bio-therapy in PLA 454th Hospital.  At that time, the bio-therapy was still in clinical trial and patients suffered grave pain during the treatment. 

		<P><A id="3" onclick="turnToNext3(this.id)">[Read more]</A><A id="-3" onclick="turnBack3(this.id)">[Backwards]</A></P></DIV><DIV id="patients-txt4" class="patients-txt" style="text-align:left;font-size:1.2em;">
		Having no other choice, Mr. Liu chose to try out the new therapy, though there was no legal insurance and no guarantee was made.  During that time, he regularly received interferon and other biologicals, hoping to kill the cancer.  After 2 years of such practice, he surprisingly found that the tumor tissues had vanished and he became cancer-free.  And now it’s 2018.  Over the years, his recovery has become a legendary example of victory against cancer, inspiration for doctors and alike patients.  Mr. Liu also described to our team members the torture and possible side effects that could be brought by chemo-therapy.  He believes that our highly specific strategy would actually be of benefit and reduce the suffering of cancer patients, which truly encouraged us.
		<P><A id="4" onclick="turnToNext3(this.id)">[Read more]</A><A id="-4" onclick="turnBack3(this.id)">[Backwards]</A></P></DIV><DIV id="patients-txt5" class="patients-txt" style="text-align:left;font-size:1.2em;">
		Mr. Liu emphasized on the significance of a drug’s specificity.  He himself endured the side effects of chemotherapy as it also damaged his healthy organs.  During his visits to other cancer patients, he also noticed other side effects such as hair loss and dermatitis.  Those effects not only lower the life quality of the patients, but more importantly reduce their confidence towards cancer.  In this way, his interview gave us a more intuitive understanding of the strong side effects of chemotherapy and the implication that there is an urgent need for high specificity drugs.<P><A id="5" onclick="turnToNext3(this.id)">[Read more]</A><A id="-5" onclick="turnBack3(this.id)">[Backwards]</A></P></DIV><DIV id="patients-txt6" class="patients-txt" style="text-align:left;font-size:1.2em;">
		Mr. Liu has his own opinions on new cancer therapies.  Before this interview, we weren’t very confident about our project as it was based on a new theory.  Mr. Liu’s words encouraged us.  He said that he strongly supports novel therapies as he himself is a direct beneficiary of such.  And he assures the team that the general public are accepting the idea of new bio-therapies.  As technology develops, new therapies will show more of their advantages.  If new projects can well pass the clinical trials, they will eventually become recognized by the patient.(<A href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="turnToNext3(6)">Click here to see the video</A>)
