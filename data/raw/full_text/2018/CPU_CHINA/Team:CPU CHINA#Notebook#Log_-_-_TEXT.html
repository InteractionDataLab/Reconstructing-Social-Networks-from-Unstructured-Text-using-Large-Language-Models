Early Stages
As is shown in Human Practice , we China Pharmaceutical University has a club for synthetic biology and iGEM.

These 5 have long been club members of CPU Bio-X Club.They witnessed the success of their senior schoolmates and was determined and ready for this year’s competition. After intense group study and brainstorming for 4 months, Shuyao Zhou’s scheme of condition RNA interference (though very rough compared with today’s whole project) was the most feasible one, and was approved by our PI Prof.Tian.
