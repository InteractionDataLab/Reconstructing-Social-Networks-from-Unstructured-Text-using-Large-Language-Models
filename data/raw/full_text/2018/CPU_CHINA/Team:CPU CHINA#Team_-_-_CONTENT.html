I also do some lab and human practice as well. Participate in iGEM is an interesting experience, we have learned a lot from conducting our project. Hope to see you in Boston!

I kind of came up with this idea of conditional RNA interference, so, you’re welcome. Then I take control of the other ideas, such as the wiki, human practice and stuff. I make sure that the whole team is being creative and productive. But I don’t really do the lab work here, so you’ll have to contact other people for that. Currently I’m studying in Leiden, and if things go well I’ll do my master’s somewhere in Canada. I’ve evolved a lot from preparing for the competition and I hope you do, too.
