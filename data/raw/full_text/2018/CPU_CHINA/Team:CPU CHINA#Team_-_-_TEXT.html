Huandi Xu
Hello there, this is Huandi of CPU_CHINA, glad to meet you!I play the most “boresome” role in the team since my duty is contacting with my colleagues to guarantee everything are heading the right direction(Lab, wiki and all that stuff). I also do some lab and human practice as well. Participate in iGEM is an interesting experience, we have learned a lot from conducting our project. Hope to see you in Boston!
Shuyao Zhou
Hello, I’m Shuyao. I kind of came up with this idea of conditional RNA interference, so, you’re welcome. Then I take control of the other ideas, such as the wiki, human practice and stuff. I make sure that the whole team is being creative and productive. But I don’t really do the lab work here, so you’ll have to contact other people for that. Currently I’m studying in Leiden, and if things go well I’ll do my master’s somewhere in Canada. I’ve evolved a lot from preparing for the competition and I hope you do, too.
Junqing Zhang
Hello, iGEMers! I'm Junqing Zhang, a senior student in China Pharmaceutical University, and major in Pharmaceutical Analysis. It's my pleasure to be involved in CPU_CHINIA and the last couple of months were such an enjoyable and meaningful time for me. In our team, I was responsible for the plasmid design. And more, I participated in some graphic design such as team logo and schematic diagram. It is my honor that we can make great progress together. I'm so glad to have this excellent experience working with such a lot of great minds. Last but not least, hope we can achieve what we deserve.
Kexin Cao
Hi, guys! This is Kexin Cao from CPU_CHINA, a senior student majoring in Traditional Chinese Pharmacy at China Pharmaceutical University. It's my fortune to be a member of CPU Bio-X Club  and work together with these excellent person. It is there I just realize how marvellous life science is, especially immunology. I participate in the lab and HP in our team. I think you will find something interesting in our project—Rig！Wish every team good luck and look forward to see you at the jamboree!

During the procession of preparation, not only my practical ability but also communicative ability has improved. It is my honor that we can make great progress together. And I will treasure this excellent experience working with so many great minds.
Xingnuo Cheng
Hi, this is Xingnuo Cheng, a student from China Pharmaceutical University.  It is such a wonderful experience to participate in the iGEM and meet fellow brilliant students.  During the experiment, I have learnt a lot and I am glad to share the experience with you!
Wanli Zhang
Hello,everyone! This is Wanli Zhang，you can also call me rabbit.During the competition, I have successfully completed my undergraduate studies from China Pharmaceutical University and continue to pursue postgraduate studies at the school. As a member of CPU-CHINA, I am honored to join the team and contribute to this through my own efforts. During the period, I was mainly responsible for the progress and arrangement of the experiment. In the process, I learned a lot of new knowledge and skills, and more importantly, I know a group of people who have dreams. I look forward to colliding with other iGEMers in Boston in the near future.
Ying Miao
Hello,everybody! This is Ying Miao, a senior student in China Pharmaceutical University, major in Information Management and Information System. I am interested in computer technology, design, as well as biology. And it brings me great fun to working and studing together with other members of Team CPU-China. I am mainly responsible for the wiki design in my team, from which process I get something amazing and also have a lot of fun. For all the efforts we made, best wishes to us!
