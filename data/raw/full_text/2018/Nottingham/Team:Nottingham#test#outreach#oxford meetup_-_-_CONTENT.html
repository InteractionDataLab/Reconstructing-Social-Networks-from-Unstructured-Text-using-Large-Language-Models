This was one of the best opportunities to make collaborations with other teams and bring back useful information that we gained during 2 days in Oxford on 12th-13th July 2018.</P><P>The first day was very interesting! We got an opportunity to present our project, answer questions and get feedback from other iGEM teams. This was very useful as it helped our team to understand what type of question the jury might ask at the Giant Jamboree. As well as this, we took part in a collaboration workshop. It was a great chance to meet other teams, discuss our projects and also make collaborations, which is a very important part of iGEM.</P><P>The next morning, we started with a short introduction of activities. We were split into 3 groups and started our lecture sessions. The first one was called “The iGEM Alumni Trouble-shooting Workshop”, where we focused on our problems and shared our iGEM experiences so far. This helped us to understand how other teams are doing and gain advice from last year’s winners and alumni. Then we had a lecture on human practices, safety and security. This lecture was extremely important because it helped our team to understands the concept of human practices and gave us some tips about how to avoid mistakes in the safety and security part of iGEM. The final lecture was about entrepreneurship. This helped us to look at our project from another perspective and learn about the After iGEM potential for our team.</P><P>Hassan, Sofya and Nemira were brainstorming a lot during these two days, so we came back to Nottingham full of different ideas about what we can do or change. We presented these thoughts to the rest of our team, who had even more ideas!</P><P>To conclude, we found the meetup incredibly useful and informative. We learned, plus collaborated with so many different teams and loved getting to know more about each other’s different projects. We look forward to implementing the skills and knowledge that we learned in Oxford very soon!</P></DIV></SECTION><DIV class="ui container PageCard_container_1ok2Drx5q2skrrX8ItRY6X"><A href="/Team:Nottingham/test/sponsors" class="ui fluid basic button">About our sponsors</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
