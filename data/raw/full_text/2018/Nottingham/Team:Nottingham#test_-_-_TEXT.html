Overview
Welcome to the Nottingham iGEM 2018 Human Practices pages. This overview will introduce you to the projects that we investigation for our Human Practices efforts, as well as why we investigated them and what our results showed.
For our silver medal criteria, we complied 3 reports on the impact of our project, how people feel about phage therapy and what current legislation there is on phage therapy.      The objective of compiling these reports was to investigate whether our work was responsible and good for the world. We engaged with a variety of communities including field experts, community discussion groups and scientific articles and research papers to gain a wide scope of information to demonstrate the positive impact of our work.
For our gold medal criteria, we analysed how we could integrate the findings of our discussion group and field expert interviews into our project. We chose to document this via a clear flowchart so that we can explain how we have taken on board feedback and modified our project as a result.
For outreach, we hosted 3 events to teach children aged 4-16 about synthetic biology. We hosted these events in schools, libraries and our own University to engage a variety of community groups.  For our collaborations, we were lucky enough to work with 4 amazing teams on a variety of projects including characterising our promoters, collecting water samples and completing wiki grammar checks. We chose these collaborations to showcase the variety of teams and projects that take part in iGEM and to learn more about different projects.
Finally, we had 4 articles published in 4 different newspapers/blogs across a range of platforms. This enabled our team to showcase our work and engage a wide range of community audiences in the iGEM competition. We hope you enjoy learning about our Human Practices work on this yearâ€™s project. Please scroll down to see a list of all our human practices work.
