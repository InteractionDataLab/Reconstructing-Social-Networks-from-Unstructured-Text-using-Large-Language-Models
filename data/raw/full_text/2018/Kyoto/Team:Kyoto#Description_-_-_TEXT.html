Here is Description! (The content won't change, but the English might be revised.)
Ions play an important role in almost all of the biological reactions. Without ions, a living organism cannot maintain their vital activity and therefore, ion strength has a huge impact on them. Devices that synthetic biology develops also affected by such a restriction.
These Devices are ever-improving and many researchers are working very hard to devise a solution for every problem we confront in this world. Among this background, controlling ion concentration sometimes become an especially vital role. For example, when you have low salt concentration, you may solve by adding salt to culture solution. However, what if the salt concentration was too high? This will be a difficult problem.
If we could develop a new device that collects sodium under a high salt concentration environment, this could become a significant tool to support bio-sensing and bio-remediation. Additionally, this device may also be applied to things such as factory disposal and salt damage. It might become a new approach to solve that kind of environmental issues.
How far can we do with biological desalination system?This question has not yet discussed fully. Thus this year, our team addressed a problem.
To deal with this problem, we bioengineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae and increased Na+ uptake system in their plasma membrane and vacuolar. Then, by expressing a mechanism that adheres to Saccharomyces cerevisiae each other on the cell wall, Saccharomyces cerevisiae which has absorbed Na + in solution is aggregated and recovered as a paste.  By developing this system, we believe that a simpler and easier to use biological desalination system can be realized.

Advice on writing your Project Description
We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be concise, accurate, and unambiguous in your achievements.
References
iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you thought about your project and what works inspired you.
