・Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
---- We have registered and are looking very forward to attending the Giant Jamboree!
        Visit our Team page.
・Meet all deliverables on the Competition Deliverables page.
---- We met all.
・Create a page on our team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of our project.
---- We attributed all works done by outside collaborators accurately and thoroughly.
        Visit our Attribution page.
・Improve the characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information on that part's Main Page in the Registry.
----We improved the characterization of these existing BioBrick Part.
     ・ BBa_K517001
     ・ BBa_J63006
      BBa_K517001 is an inducible promoter for S. cerevisiae. In this year, we expressed hairpin-loop dsRNA by this promoter and determined the quantity.
     We reported the result in the parts page . The same is true for BBa_J63006.
Silver
・New BioBrick Parts of our own design that is central to our project works as expected.
----We experimentally validated the following parts of our design and construction.
    ・ BBa_K2403000     ・ BBa_K2403002      We confirmed RNA with RRE induced nuclear transport dependently on REV.
・We have significantly worked with any other registered iGEM team in a meaningful way.
----We collaborated with Japan iGEM teams, Chinese teams and Taiwan team.
Visit our collaboration page for details.
・We have thought carefully and creatively about whether our work is safe, responsible and good for the world.
----Our project leads to the conservation for the Japanese scenery and relief of suffering from pine disease.
Visit our page for the discussion of the merit, the safety, and the responsibility.
Gold
・Expand on our silver medal activity by demonstrating how we have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of our project.
----We discuss the pine disease problems with forestry associations and conducted the forestry survey. We really gathered the nematodes in the forest and observed them in the lab. We fed S. cerevisiae with our reporter protein（ BBa_K2403003 ）to them and investigated how many percent of the wild nematodes we can use for our project. As a result, we couldn’t confirm the nematodes except for B. xylophilus preyed on S. cerevisiae. This suggested to us that our “B. x Buster” can specifically target B. xylophilus. Visit our page .
・Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part.
----We improved the following parts.
・ BBa_K1875003
・ BBa_K530008
・ BBa_J63006
・ BBa_K517001
We created a new part from BBa_K1875003 , BBa_K530008 , and observed the strong fluorescence of EGFP in S. cerevisiae.( https://2017.igem.org/Team:Kyoto/Results ) Furthermore, we succeeded in dying the digestive tract by GFP. We established the novel the usage and improved the function of the existing part.
We confirmed BBa_J63006 and BBa_K517001 are useful for the expression of loop hairpin dsRNA in S. cerevisiae.
・We confirmed that Our project works.
----We optimized how to culture and to take photograph, and finally succeeded in recording B.xylophilus preyed on S. cereviisae as a movie. We developed the fluorescent maker to distinguish the B. xylophilus and established the system which makes it possible to recognize only B. xylophilus which eats S. cerevisiae by a microscopy. We constructed the plasmid for S. cerevisiae to express dsRNA and determined the quantity.
We confirmed we can observed the B. xylophilus selectively which preyed on S. cerevisiae expressing dsRNA by our fluorescent reporter.

Integrated human practice
Through this practice we tried to bridge the desire of the people who protect the pine, the damage caused by pine disease, and the theory (laboratory) and the practice (mountain).
Visit our integrated human practice for details.
Engagement
We attempted to convey the usefulness of GMO to people who showed a strong rejection response to genetically modified foods but failed. Based on this experience, it became a good opportunity to think about how we can listen to our opinions as to how to disagree with opinions.
We had good opportunity to think about the way we get people who disagree with us listen to ours.
