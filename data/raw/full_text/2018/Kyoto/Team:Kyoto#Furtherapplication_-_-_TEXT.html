Thanks to being able to B. xylophilus.
In Japan,a new strain of pines resistant to B. xylophilus, attempts are being made to select strains of pine that show natural resistance to B. xylophilus and mate them.
However, this method has several problems and has not been put to practical use [1].
1. The pines are not 100% resistant simply because they show improved resistance to B. xylophilus.
2. In the case of gardens and sightseeing spots, characteristics of the strains such as branching should be emphasized, but such considerations are limited using this method.
3. Under stress, B. xylophilus itself may evolve to become pathogenic to currently resistant pines.
These problems could be solved by making recombinant RNAi pine trees expressing dsRNA.
Figure 1 RNAi pines will solve the problem of pine-wilt disease.
However,
1. It takes at least B. xylophilus by injecting them into the trunk.
2. It is not yetB. xylophilus.
3. There is currently
(point 3 above).
the same order Tylenchida as B. xylophilus, escaped from the parasitism of M. incognita by making the plant express dsRNA [2],[3]. That is to say, the application of B. x. B may not be limited to feeding RNAi to B. xylophilus.
15% of all nematodes are plant parasitic nematodes which have stylet similar to B. xylophilus [4]. These nematodes have caused enormous damage to important crop plants including potatoes, eggplants, rice, tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes, and carrots, resulting in an estimated annual loss of $8 billion in the United States and $78 billion worldwide [5]. Therefore, urgent measures are required. RNAi expression in plants is a powerful weapon against these pathogenic nematodes, so development of such technology has a strong potential for application.
The B. x. B. system we developed can be used as a preliminary RNAi evaluation system to target plant-specific pathogens, before initiating breeding of recombinant crops. If efficient breeding is carried out and countermeasures progress, many plant diseases will be abolished, which will have a strong impact on resolving current threats to global food resources.
