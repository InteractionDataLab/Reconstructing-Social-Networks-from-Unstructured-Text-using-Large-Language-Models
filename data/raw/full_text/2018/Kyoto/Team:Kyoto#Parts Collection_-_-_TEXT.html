The function of our Part Collection
This Part Collection enables to create a biological desalination yeast with aggregation system. BBa_K2665018, BBa_K2665019 and BBa_K2665020 work for yeast aggregation. BBa_K2665011 and BBa_K2665012 can be used for raising yeasts' halotorelance, and parts of BBa_K2665013 to BBa_K2665016 enhance yeasts' ability of Na+ uptake. BBa_K2665011 to BBa_K2665016 include a constitutive yeast promoter and a common terminator so iGEMers can use them without assembly to express these proteins in yeast.
