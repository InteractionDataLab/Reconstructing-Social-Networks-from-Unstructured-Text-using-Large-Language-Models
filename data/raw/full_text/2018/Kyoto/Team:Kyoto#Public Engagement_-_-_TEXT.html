16th ISS
From Feb 27th to March 5th, We participated in the 16thInternational Student Seminar held by Biostudies Department of our University in order to propagate synthetic biology and iGEM. (Official link： http://www.16thiss.lif.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index.html )
There, we have a presentation and poster session about our last year’s project. During Q&A time, many people seemed to be concerned about biosafety, so this opportunity made us consider biosafety more.
Learning Lounge
Learning Lounge On April 25th, we had a presentation at Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences(iCeMS) in order to propagate synthetic biology and iGEM. There, we talked about why we do iGEM activities, what we want to do in the future with experiments acquired through iGEM activities. ( https://www.icems.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ja/community/lounge/ )
Lecture to high school students
We gave a lecture to middle and high school students of Showa Pharmaceutical University attached high school·attached middle school. The content of the lecture began with the basic principles of synthetic biology and explained the project of iGEM Kyoto while also touching ethical issues of biology and biotechnology. After the lecture, we gave students an agenda and had discussions.
The first agenda is “whether synthetic animals can reproduce cartoon characters of animation and games? ” Initially, it was discussed separately for each group, but the discussion has been deepening and a number of unique ideas appeared. The second agenda is “What do you think about a study on placing chloroplasts in humans and making chloroplast humans?”. We tend to think about technical aspects quickly, but for junior high and high school students, they had the power to think things flexible on their own, and opinions that refer to biosafety, ethical aspects, even human happiness were seen.
In connection with this junior high and high school students, we learned that there is a need to review the project not only from the biological point of view but also from the perspective of biosafety and ethics.
