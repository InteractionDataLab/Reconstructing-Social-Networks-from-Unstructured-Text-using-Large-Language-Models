1)Safe project design
All of the species we expect to use are not harmful for human.
2)Safe lab work
Our experiments are normal molecular biology experiment and does not include special dangerous steps. We will properly follow how to use equipment such as autoclave and centrifuge, and will conduct experiments safely. We treat yeasts, bacteria etc. created by observing the safety guidelines and sterilize after the experiment is over. We will collect all laboratory effluent and culture waste liquid, completely sterilize and detoxify them by prescribed method so as not to let any E. coli and yeast that we made to the natural environment after collection out. For organic solvents, after collection, we ask for treatment at university's environmental safety center. The microorganisms we make do not have infectivity to humans, but for safety we wear gloves and safety glasses for all experiments.
Prof.Kitabatake, Prof.Woltjen, Prof.Sota and Prof.Ohtan are responsible for all experiments and overseeing the whole process of the experiment. Before the experiment, students participate in a safety workshop held in the university and are undergoing training to conduct safe experiments. Experiments using Escherichia coli and yeast are instructed by experts who are experimenting with such a species in a daily scale.
We will conduct all experiments safely following the safety guideline of Kyoto university. For gene recombination experiments, we observe Kyoto university safety and occupational health reference manual 2018 ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JyKun0qIsp6O1ts2nJGPSdt23NKrSfBQ/view?usp=sharing ) and do so.
We are registered with the Kyoto University Recombinant DNA Committee and the University follows the guidelines of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity.
3)Safe shipment
Before submission, we have read all related pages in the iGEM web page.
