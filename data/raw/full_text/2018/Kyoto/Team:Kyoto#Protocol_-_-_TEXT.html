Table
On this page, the ecolibrium team would like to share with you the protocols that we have been using over the summer. This library of protocols has been developed alongside our supervisors for the purpose of this study. Here you can find the exact methods we use to generate our data and results. We share them in the interest of reproducibility.
Chemical Transformation
Materials:
Competent E.coli(Dh5alpha) LB broth
Ice
Selection plates
Methods:
Thaw 10µL competent E. coli cells on ice for 10 minutes
Add:
-2.5 µl DNA from a ligation reaction mix or
DNA of a known plasmid
Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.
Place the mixture on ice for 15 minutes. Do not mix.
Heat shock at exactly 42°C for exactly 45 seconds. Do not mix.
Place on ice for 1-3 minutes. Do not mix.
Pipette 100 µl of room temperature SOC or LB media into the mixture.
Incubate at 37°C for 40 minutes.
Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tube and inverting.
Spread:
All of each transformation reaction onto a selection plate. If the reaction is too much :
Pellet cells at 8000rpm for 3 minutes
Remove and dispense appropriate volume of supernatant
Re-suspend cells by light vortexing
Plate resuspended cells as above
Growing Overnight Cultures
Materials:
3 ml LB broth
3 μl antibiotic
Tips
culture tube
Methods:
Overnight cultures were prepared under sterile conditions using a clean bench
Add 3 ml liquid LB media into 12 ml culture tubes
Add 3 μl of appropriate antibiotic into the broth
Using the tip, pick a single colony and inoculate the cultures by dipping the loop into the LB broth
Seal the tubes and incubate overnight at 37°C shaking at 130-150 rpm
PCR From Plasmid DNA Template
Materials:   We used various PCR Polymerase, and we obeyed each protocols. We show our most frequent protocol here.
2x Q5 Mastermix
10 µM forward primer

Sterile water
Plasmid DNA
Methods:
For a 50 µL reaction
In a PCR tube on ice, combine  1-10 ng of plasmid DNA, 2.50 µL of 10 µM forward primer, 2.50 µL of 10 µM reverse primer to a PCR tube on ice, 25 µL of 2x Q5 Mastermix, and sterile water up to 50 µL.
Note: It is important to add Q5 Master Mix last in order to prevent primer degradation  caused by the 3 ́→ 5 ́ exonuclease activity
Gently mix the reaction
If necessary, collect the liquid to the bottom of the PCR tube by spinning briefly
Transfer the PCR tube from ice to a PCR machine preheated to 98°C to begin thermocycling
Thermocycling
The PCR machine should be set to run the following steps:

Note 1: Use the NEB Tm calculator should be used to determine the annealing temperature when using Q5: http://tmcalculator.neb.com/#!/
Colony PCR
Materials:
Sterile Water
2x EmeraldAmp MAX mastermix
E. coli colony
10 µM forward primer
10 µM reverse primer
Methods:
Make mastermix of reaction.Add 2.5µL of EmeraldAmp MAX,0.05µL of 10µM forward primer, and 0.05µL of 10µM reverse primer to 2.4µL of water each reaction.
Touch your objective colony with tip then touch the 5µL of reaction liquid in PCR tube.
If necessary, collect the liquid to the bottom of the PCR tube by spinning briefly
