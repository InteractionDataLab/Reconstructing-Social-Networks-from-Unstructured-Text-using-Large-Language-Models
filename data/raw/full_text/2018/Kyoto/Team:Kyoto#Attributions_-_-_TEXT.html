■Instructors
Dr. Makoto Kitabatake (Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University) helped us all through our project, taught the way of management of a team, provided us with a laboratory , and gave us professional advice as well as training us on the experiment of S. cerevisiae. In addition, he helped collect and analysis experiment data, and reform our wiki writing. He also gave us safety education and ethics education.
Dr. Knut Woltjen (Center of iPS Cell Research and Application, and Hakubi Center for Advanced Research, Kyoto University) helped us all through our project, and gave us professional advice on cloning.
■Lab support
Dr. Dan Ohtan Wang (Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences, iCeMS, Kyoto University) provided us with a laboratory and some reagents.
Dr. Yoshie Fujiwara (Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences, iCeMS, Kyoto University) taught us usage of experiment equipment and gave us professional advice on cloning.
Prof. Ken Motohashi(Division of Life Sciences, Kyoto Sangyo University) taught us the detailed protocol and technique of SLiCE method, and gave us advice on our cloning. Moreover, he provided us with SLiCE solution and JM109.
■Fundraising help and advice
COSMO BIO provided us with reagents and kits, free of charge.
Promega Corporation provided us with regents and kits, free of charge.
SPEC from Kyoto University, crowdfunding.
■Project support and advice
Prof. Nobuyuki Uozumi (Department of Biomolecular Engineering Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University) gave us advice about mutant strain, AtHKT1 expression plasmid, and project design.
Prof. Norio Ishida (People’s Institute of Environment) taught us seriousness of salt damage.
Prof. Shinya Funakawa (Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University) gave us hints to apply our device.
Kinki Regional Agricultural Administration Office taught us agriculture and salt damage in Japan.
Prof. Haruyuki Fujimaki (Arid Land Research Center, Tottori University) taught us about arid land drainage.
Mr.Onishi(Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences) taught us current situation of desalination works.
Dr. Watanabe(Yamasa Soy Sauce) taught us the experimental method of soy sauce yeast and introduced us a few soy sauce yeasts.
Dr. Inoue(Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto Uniersity) taught us the method to fix yeasts in column.
■Lab support
Prof. Teiji Sota (Graduate School of Science, Kyoto University) helped us with the usage of laboratory, provided us with a laboratory, and let us use -80℃ freezer, the microscopy and Nanodrop.
Dr. Shuhei Nasuda (Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University) provided us with a laboratory and a meeting room.
■Difficult technique support
Dr. Masaru Kobayashi (Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University) advised our project and proposed and showed us a boil method.
Dr. Kumiko Ochiai (Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University) analyzed sodium ion concentration of  our samples, and mentored the analysis.
Dr.Toshihiko Takeiwa (Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University) supported use of fluorescence microscope.
