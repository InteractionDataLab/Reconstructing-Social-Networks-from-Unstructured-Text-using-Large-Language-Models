As introduced in Human Practice, we iGEM Kyoto 2018 have jumped out of the laboratory, made exchanges with a wide variety of people, learned a lot of things and added depth to the contents of the project. In this page, we will introduce an overview of how these Human Practice activities educated us and led to the improvement of the project. We will introduce it by dividing into three parts.
The first is an interview with salt damage experts and what we learned from it. We were able to learn about the specific circumstances that we could apply our device and got insight into the needs and concerns of salt damage, and these lead to the design of a new device.
The second relates to the first part, it is a biosafety problem. From Public Engagement activities and exchanges with experts, we recognized the needs of further safety measures for our devices, and we decided to move on to the development of new parts to guide yeast cell aggregation. This is the point that iGEM Kyoto's project this year received the greatest influence from Human Practice.
Thirdly, in order to create a more efficient salt absorbing device, we interacted with many experts. Starting from the device creation method, we learned the performance evaluation method, the creation of the final device form, and application method. From their advice, the outline of this project was determined.
We summarized the activities of our integrated human practice in a chart shown below. Three parts of work influenced each other and this helps you visualize how we were able to improve the project by human practice work.
