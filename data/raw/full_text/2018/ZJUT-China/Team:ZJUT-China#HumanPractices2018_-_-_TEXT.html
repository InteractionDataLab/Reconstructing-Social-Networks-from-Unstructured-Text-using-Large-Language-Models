Human Practice
Our project focuses on solving issues that are extremely relevant to human survival and development, so we must study the research objectives and adjustment plans of the project through communicating with stakeholders. Based on this, our project has an important value that can contribute to solve the problem of bacterial resistance.
Degrading resistance genes in the laboratory is a challenge, but developing molecular machines that degrade resistance genes in the real world is another more difficult challenge.   We adjust our designs by meeting with experts and stakeholders to meet everyone's wishes as much as possible and to make our designs useful and responsible to society. Our process of integrating human practice can illustrate how our project are adapted and refined as human practice advances.
For example, we contacted Dr. Tang Biao of Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Director Xu Shengchen of the Environmental Protection Agency and interviewed them. We learned that our project was supported by the government. In addition, we conducted experiments on water samples taken from fisheries and obtained the types of resistance genes in the environment near the fishery. additionally, Director Zhang Wei of Huadong Pharmaceutical Factory made recommendations to our project, we adjusted our experimental schemes to enable the design of molecular machines to better adapt in society. Furthermore, we summarize how important changes of our project and interactions with stakeholders have produced impressive changes in our experiments and designs.
