3.Transfer three 2ml in each group into the 2ml centrifuge tube, cool them on ice for 20-30min, then centrifuge them for 10min at 4 ℃, 4000rp / min.
PS:·From this step on, all operations should be performed on the ice, as fast and steady as possible.
4.Empty supernatant medium, gently suspend cells with 1ml cold CaCl2 solution(0.1mo1/L), then ice bath.
5.4℃, 4000r/min, centrifuge for 10min.
6.Empty supernatant, add 500µl cold CaCl2 solution, suspend cells carefully. Then, 4℃, 4000r/min, cenreifuge for 10min.
7.Empty supernatant, add 500µl cold CaCl2 solution, suspend cells carefully. After being placed on the ice for a short time, the competent cells are made.
8.The competent cells can be used in transformation experiment directly, or it can be added to 30% glycerol sterilized by high pressure, mixed evenly in the 1.5ml centrifuge tube, placed at -70℃, and can be preserved for half a year to one year.
