Throughout the past ten months we have received tremendous support and encouragement from many people, including professors, our instructors and experts. We'd like to thank all those people who have helped us so that we can complete the project successfully.       This year we established a team in December and divided it into three groups for different works. During the winter vacation, some teachers in our college provided some lessons about safety training to help us creating better experiences. And we had a fascinating and intense brainstorm from January to March. At the same time, our work about human practice went on together. At the end of the March, we finally ensured our project and began to spare no effort to struggle for it.       All experiments were performed by members of this group. And all the presentation materials and Wiki were finished by all members of ZJUT-China.
