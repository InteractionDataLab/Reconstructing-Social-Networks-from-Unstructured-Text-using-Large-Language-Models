            We evaluated a CRISPR/Cas9 system with MG1655 and MG1655 ΔpanD. The two strains were transformed with pCas, which expresses Cas9. The sgRNA which targets to a site in the panD gene was expressed in a plasmid pTargetF-panD. The pTargetF-panD was able to transform MG1655 ΔpanD pCas9, but not MG1655 pCas9, indicating that CRISPR/Cas9 was able to recognize and cut DNA in the chromosomal gene.

          To test whether the CRISPR/Cas9 can cut an ARG, we designed an sgRNA which targeted to the chloramphenicol resistance gene. The sgRNA was expressed in pTargetF-cm. which was transformed into MG1655 ΔpanD carrying a chloramphenicol resistance gene. We observed that all transformants grew in the medium without chloramphenicol, but failed to grow in the medium with chloramphenicol. The experiment showed that the CRISPR/Cas9 system was able to cut ARG in the genome.

            In our experiment we required transformation data and two growth curve in the end. Fig.1 shows that after adding arabinose, <I>E. coli</I> MG1655 with P<SUB>BAD</SUB>-Cas9 plasmid stopped growing. We used OD<SUB>600</SUB> to characterize the cells amount so to proving that the expression of Cas9 protein can be regulated by 10mM arabinose. Fig.2 shows how different concentrations of arabinose affects the Cas9 expression.

          </P><P>In the chloramphenicol gene cleavage experiment, we used a plate containing ara for transformation experiments, and the cleavage of the chloramphenicol gene could be characterized by transformation efficiency. The results are showed in Table 1:
          </P><P>
            Our results show that inducing the expression of Cas9 using ara has no effect on the transformation efficiency of wild type, and the transformation efficiency of <I>E. coli</I> cmR is greatly reduced. Therefore, we can conclude that the transformation efficiency is reduced because Cas9 cleaves the chloramphenicol gene on the genome under the guidance of sgRNA-cm. Moreover, when we did not add Ara, the transformation efficiency of <I>E. coli</I> cmR was also lower than that of <I>E. coli</I> wild type. This suggests that Cas9 exhibits high gene cleavage efficiency in bacteria because P<SUB>BAD</SUB> is a well-regulated promoter.

The result also reflects that the blue light provided cannot completely suppress the expression of CRISPR/Cas9. It is also remarkable that the transformation efficiency with pTargetF-cm under the dark condition was lower than that under the light condition, indicating that the CRISPR/Cas9 system showed stronger activity under dark condition, achieving the purpose of cutting a resistance gene with the light-controlled CRISPR/Cas9 system.

            We did three sets of parallel experiments and the result is shown in Fig.4.
          </P><DIV class="note">Fig.4 The growth curves in four different conditions</DIV><H2>Conclusions and analysis</H2><P>
            Analysis of the experimental results revealed that the lacI repression system couldn’t regulate the transcription of sgRNA successfully, because the four growth curves in different conditions are very similar. We suspect the lac operator which directly links to the sgRNA affects its conformation so that the sgRNA can’t be unable to function properly.
          </P><P> After consulting the literatures, we demonstrated it was exactly a DNA sequence before the sgRNA that prevented it from maturation. And it also didn’t work when we added a repeat artificially before sgRNA. Because it has been published that tracrRNA directs the maturation of crRNAs by the activities of the widely conserved endogenous RNase III and the CRISPR-associated Csn1 protein. This limits the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in <I>E. coli</I>.
          </P><P>Here we present two solutions. First, try to find a suitable repression system to replace the lacI repression system, which means sgRNA should be linked directly to the transcription initiation site (TSS). Second, activate the type I CRISPR/Cas system in <I>E. coli</I> because of the less limitation in comparison with the type II CRISPR/Cas system.
