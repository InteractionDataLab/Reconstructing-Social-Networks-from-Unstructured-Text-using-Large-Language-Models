In 10,000 units, the dose increased to nearly 5 times.Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the earliest and most widely distributed superbacterium. According to the latest statistics from the World Health Organization, approximately 53 million people worldwide are infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus each year. The successful application of antibiotics to today's only seventy years, the problem of “super bacteria” has been widely distributed and affected. Antibiotic weapons are hard to have a major impact in this long-term arms race with bacteria. Therefore, our team hopes to utilized the synthetic biology tool to reduce the super bacteria.

                      We want to survey the content of resistant bacteria in the environment, so we went to the aquaculture farm to study the content of resistant bacteria in the aquaculture environment and the types of resistance genes contained in them. After investigation, we found that there are many common resistance genes in the discharge water. Degradation of a single specific resistance gene does not solve the problem of widespread resistance gene contamination. We believe that we can not only stay in the treatment environment, the most resistant genes should focus on larger problems and solve bacterial resistance problems. After our investigation, we found that drug-resistant bacteria are ubiquitous, and resistance gene contamination is a potential environmental threat. We want to solve this problem.

The most effective way to solve this problem is to eliminate bacterial resistance genes; the existing processing technology can only deal with some that have spread to the environment. The genetic contaminants cannot eliminate pollution sources from the roots, and gene editing techniques and the CRISPR/Cas9 system can help us solve this problem. So, after our discussion, we wanted to use the CRISPR/Cas9 technology with efficient gene editing efficiency and the design of the advanced igem team. The light control system constructs a controlled genetic engineering strain with the ability to self-eliminate resistance genes. Experts mentioned that resistance gene contamination mainly exists in industrial production, so the initial goal of our experiment is to reduce the emission of resistance genes into the factory. In addition, we expect an investment environment to address the resistance gene contamination in the environment, which will involve the work of our group to achieve true environmental protection.

Most people find that the efficacy of antibiotics is gradually declining. More and more bacteria are resistant and cannot be killed by common antibiotics. We understand that most super-resistant bacteria are produced in medical waste, wastewater discharge, pharmaceutical companies and laboratories.

                        Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences is a comprehensive public agricultural research institution directly under the People's Government of Zhejiang Province. We hope to advance our project by interviewing experts in the field of resistance research of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences. We communicated with Teacher Tang. Through communication with him, we learned that China does not have specific emission standards, policies, and laws for drug-resistant genes. He also reminded us that our plans can be gradually promoted while interviewing relevant legislative bodies, such as promoting the establishment of genetic emission resistance standards. . Teacher Tang Wei believes that it is necessary to fight resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria. There are many resistance genes in multidrug resistant bacteria. So we introduced him to our project. He believes that if we can eliminate the resistance genes of engineered bacteria before discharge, then it is valuable to solve the problem of resistance gene contamination. For Dr. Tang Biao's professional research on resistance gene detection, he finally gave us some data that can be used for mathematical modeling. There is no doubt that this is a very powerful driving force for our project.

If the actual application is to be carried out, the main problem is that in terms of cost, the cost mainly comes from two aspects, one is the hardware of the light control system, and the other is the cost of electricity. Electricity is primarily converted to light and heat, so further cooling systems are needed here. The equipment of our project requires careful consideration of the sensitivity of light and the occlusion of light. Therefore, we will improve the project itself for the sensitivity and cost of light. Additionally, she also suggested that we cango to the Biosafety Ethics Committee to discuss this issue.
