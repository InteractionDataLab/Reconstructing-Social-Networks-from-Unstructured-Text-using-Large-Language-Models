Before starting the experiments, our team calibrated the necessary equipment we would need for the InterLab study. </P></DIV><DIV class="column third_size"><P>The cells in table 1 to the right represent the plate wells, and all values are measured in Î¼M. </P></DIV><DIV class="column two_thirds_size"><CENTER>

In the figure, the data for each sample is grouped together by device. Device 1 and Device 5 both have large variations across their data ranges, which could mean that these devices are less accurate than the others that have much more compact data. A different device, such as Device 2 or Device 6, could prove more accurate in finding a conversion between absorbance and fluorescence for different cell populations according to our data.</P><CENTER>

Samples of cells with an OD600 of ~0.1 were diluted and grown on LB + chloramphenicol plates overnight. The next morning, the colonies were counted and used to predict the number of colony forming units in 1 mL of media. </P><CENTER> Table 8.

We noticed a general positive correlation between the variables, which makes sense considering a greater number of cells should have a higher absorbance value. We noticed more variability in the positive cultures than the negative cultures. The 3 positive cultures in the bottom left portion of the data are all samples from the first positive culture and the 3 in the top right portion of the data are the three samples from the second positive culture. </P></DIV><DIV class="column two_thirds_size"><CENTER> Figure 7.

It was determined by taking the calculated CFU values for each of the 12 samples and dividing by that sample's OD600 value as determined by the plate reader. The median values between both the positive control and negative control samples are close, suggesting little variability between a positive and negative sample when determining CFU calculations from an OD600 measurement. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
