Primary PI:
Dr. Richard Anthony
Dr. Ric Anthony is an Associate Professor of Biology and Biomedical Engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. He specializes in molecular genetics, ribosome structure and function, and protein synthesis. He co-leads Rose-Hulman’s iGem team and works with students in the Synthetic Biology Laboratory doing a variety of research, including a multi-disciplinary project to determine if algae could be a source of biodiesel. His research interests lie in the areas of ribosome structure and function and antibiotic resistance and sensitivity.
Dr. Irene Reizman is an Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Her areas of expertise include biochemical engineering and biotechnology. Her research focuses on developing improved microbial strains for renewable chemical production, and she’s currently leading a student research project investigating the use of biosensors for industrial fermentation. Dr. Reizman completed a project in Germany as part of the Green Talents program and also previously worked for LS9, Whirlpool, and SCHOTT AG.

Ariel Bohner
Ariel Bohner is a senior biology and biomathematics double major from Terre Haute, IN. She is active in Varsity Track and Field, Tri Beta, and swing dancing. She also enjoys music, in general, and Horse Vaulting. (If you don’t know what that is, look it up. It will blow your mind!) Her favorite season is autumn. Her long term goals include becoming a veterinary practitioner and/or conducting research in Veterinary Science, and traveling abroad. In her free time, she loves working out, playing with Matlab functions, watching movies, and volunteering at local vet clinics.
Brittany Clark is a junior biomedical engineering and mechanical engineering double major from Du Quoin, Illinois. At Rose, she is doing undergraduate research on learning styles using brain machine interfacing. She is also an executive board member of Make it Happen, the secretary of Biomedical Engineering Society, a Sophomore Resident Tutor, and a Homework Hotline Tutor. Brittany enjoys doing what she can to make people’s lives better. In her free time, she enjoys reading books, baking, and watching shows on Netflix.

Emilie Deibel
Emilie Deibel is a sophomore chemical engineering major from Richmond, IN. She participates in Cheer, Society of Women Engineers (SWE), American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), and is the treasurer of her sorority. Emilie’s favorite book is the Sirens of Titan, and she actually read all of the Harry Potter books before watching the movies. Emilie enjoys balancing redox reactions, making informational sheets and powerpoints, and binge-watching shows on Netflix that have at least 10 seasons already.
Liz Klaas is a junior biochemistry major from Avon, IN. In addition to iGEM, she is also currently doing undergraduate research on estrogen receptors and breast cancer. Outside of the classroom, she participates in the Volleyball Club and enjoys watching Disney movies and Netflix. Her favorite season is fall where she enjoys making smores at bonfires. If she could have any superpower, she would choose the ability to breathe underwater.

Lining Pan
Lining Pan is a sophomore Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science major from Beijing, China. He has previously participated in iGEM through a high school team for two years. His favorite season is winter and he enjoys reading books and listening to music.
Kaylee Pate is a sophomore chemical engineering and biochemistry & molecular biology double major from Vincent, Ohio. She has participated in two undergraduate protein research projects while still in high school and is excited to continue research into her college career with opportunities through iGEM. She is part of Rose-Hulman’s cross country and track teams, plays saxophone in the Rose-Hulman concert band, and plans fundraisers for Rose’s chapter of Engineers Without Borders. In her free time, Kaylee enjoys refilling pipette boxes by hand, knitting, and using dark chocolate as a motivator to eat vegetables.

Elisa Weber
Elisa Weber is from Kalamazoo, Michigan. She is a sophomore and plans on double-majoring in biology and microbiology/biochemistry. She wants to be a genetic engineer after graduating, and being a member of the iGEM team will increase her experience in the area of genetics. Elisa is also a record-breaking swimmer at RHIT, with three individual records, as well as several relays and the Women’s MVP. When not in lab or compiling DNA sequences, Elisa likes to read comics about the Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, binge-watch Friends on Netflix, and reread the same book series over and over again. Her favorite season is fall, because of the late-night talks around bonfires with close friends. If she could have any superpower, Elisa would choose the power of shapeshifting.
