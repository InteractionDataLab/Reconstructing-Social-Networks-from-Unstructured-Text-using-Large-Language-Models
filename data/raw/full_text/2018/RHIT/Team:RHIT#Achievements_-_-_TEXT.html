Despite delays in part pieces arriving, our team was able to design and clone a PSB1C3 vector with PETase and all subunits of the Glycolate Oxidase genes into the E. coli strain MG1655. We were also able to insert Glycolate Oxidase into the pETDuet vector for expression analysis. An SDS page for the Glycolate Oxidase was completed and posted and the characterization assay for the Glyolate Oxidase was adapted from J.M. Lordâ€™s 1971 paper.
