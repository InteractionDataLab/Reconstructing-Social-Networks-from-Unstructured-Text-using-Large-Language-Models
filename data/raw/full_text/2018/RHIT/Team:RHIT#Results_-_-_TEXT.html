Below are the results of the SDS page we performed on our Glcyolate Oxidase gene.
The Glycolate Oxidase we submitted was cloned from /E. coli/ MG1655 and contains three subunits. It was inserted into the pETDuet vector for expression and was induced by 0.1 and 0.2 mM IPTG at 30ºC for 20 hours. All three subunits of Glycolate Oxidase(GO) are shown in the SDS-PAGE. GO contains three subunits, D,E, and F, which weigh 55.5 kDa, 38.3 kDa, and 45.0 kDa respectively. Lane 1 was BL21(DE3) with pETDuet-GO, but without IPTG induction process. Lanes 2 and 3 were BL21(DE3) with empty pETDuet vectors and contain 0.1 and 0.2 mM IPTG. Lanes 4 to 7 are BL21(De3) with pETDuet-GO. Lanes 4 and 6 were induced with 0.1 mM IPTG, and lanes 5 and 7 were induced with 0.2 mM IPTG. All the inductions were done at 30ºC.
