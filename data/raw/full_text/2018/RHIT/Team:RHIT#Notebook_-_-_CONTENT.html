After some training earlier in the week, we began our work in the actual lab. We learned how to make different broths and agars, and made Luria broth (LB) plates with chloramphenicol and LB plates with ampicillin.  Members: Ariel, Brittany, Emilie, Liz, Lining, Kaylee, and Elisa </DIV><DIV class="week"> Week 2 </DIV><DIV class="date" id="61218"> 6/12/18 </DIV><DIV class="day" id="612"> We compiled information about possible part sequences to use in our project and ran them through the Parts Registry to see what we can and cannot submit as our own parts. We then created several different sequences of one of our main parts, PETase until we decided upon an optimized mutant version that was recently discovered in April 2018. We created some rough sketches of what our complete plasmid would look like. In lab, we created competent cells out of <EM>E. coli</EM> strains MG1655 and BL21(DE3). Members: Elisa and Lining </DIV><DIV class="week"> Week 3 </DIV><DIV class="date" id="61918"> 6/19/18 </DIV><DIV class="day" id="619"> We discovered that our parts were too large to fit on a single plasmid, so two were developed. One uses pSB1C3 as the backbone, and the other uses pSB3K5.We decided to have one plasmid have the PETase and MHETase enzyme sequences while the second plasmid would have sequences for glycolaldehyde dehydrogenase, glycolaldehyde reductase, glycolate oxidase, and malate synthase.  Members: Elisa and Lining </DIV><DIV class="date" id="62118"> 6/21/18 </DIV><DIV class="day" id="621"> We emailed the researchers about the optimised PETase and did more research on previous teams who had tried to solve the plastic problem the world faces today.  We then transformed the plasmids into competent 5Alpha cells to culture, but discovered that pSB3K5 does not allow the cell to grow on the plate we wanted.  Members: Elisa and Lining </DIV><DIV class="week"> Week 4 </DIV><DIV class="date" id="62518"> 6/25/18 </DIV><DIV class="day" id="625"> We decided to use pSB3K3 as the other backbone to replace pSB3K5. We then created linearized backbones by digestion. We started to develop primers so that we could amplify our parts once we received them.  Members: Elisa and Lining </DIV><DIV class="day" id="62618"> 6/26/18 </DIV><DIV class="day" id="626"> We sent out our part sequences to be synthesized through IDT, using our two plasmid ideas. The parts all had about 30 base pairs of overlap so we could put them together in the cell. We also designed our parts so there is a ribosomal binding site between the start of each enzyme, so they can be transcribed and translated into proteins individually if need be.  Members: Elisa and Lining</DIV><DIV class="week"> Week 5 </DIV><DIV class="date" id="7618"> 7/6/18 </DIV><DIV class="day" id="76"> IDT was unable to synthesize all of our DNA sequences, so we had to break several of our sequences into smaller ones. Due to this, we had to create new primers for amplification of our new blocks. We also practiced running an SDS page, making sure that we had all the proper chemicals to do so.  Members: Elisa and Lining </DIV><DIV class="week"> Week 6 </DIV><DIV class="date" id="71218"> 7/12/18 </DIV><DIV class="day" id="712"> We rehydrated our primers that were delivered from IDT so they would be at a 10x concentration.

We also made more chloramphenicol plates, transformed the plasmids for InterLab into competent NEB5-alpha cells, replated cells for InterLab onto chloramphenicol plates, and created a glycerol stock for our InterLab cells.
 Members: Brittany and Elisa </DIV><DIV class="date" id="71718"> 7/17/18 </DIV><DIV class="day" id="717"> We inoculated cultures of transformed InterLab cells. We performed the InterLab Absorbance Calibration measured at 630 nm. We also performed the InterLab microsphere calibration measured at 630 nm. Finally, we transformed the part from well L4 into NEB5-alpha cells.
 Members: Brittany and Liz We ran parts 1-4 and 1-5 in a 2% gel and extracted part 1-4 (1-5 was not amplified.)
We also designed new primers for the extraction and submission of parts that will allow us to put our parts in the pSB1C3 backbone for submission to the registry.
 Members: Elisa</DIV><DIV class="date" id="71818"> 7/18/18 </DIV><DIV class="day" id="718"> For InterLab, we inoculated cultures of 4L and made glycerol stocks of the other InterLab parts.  Members: Brittany  We ran parts 1-5 A,1-5 B, and 1-5 C with different reverse primers for the amplification of each on a 2% gel. We also extracted part 1-5 A.

We ran the PCR products on a 1% gel and extracted the correct bands. We then followed the NEBuilder Kit protocol to create one plasmid with all of our parts using pSB1C3 as the backbone. This should be our first plasmid containing the PETase and MHETase enzymes. We plated 5 plates of our <EM>E. coli</EM> with the plasmid.

We followed the protocol to dilute the rest of the samples in triplicate so they would have an OD600 of 0.1 in the plate reader. We then diluted those 12 samples according to the protocol and plated 100μL of the appropriate dilutions on LB+Chlor plates to incubate overnight so we can count colonies tomorrow.

Fill a large bottle with lid with 570 mL of DI H2O. Insert a stir bar and place the bottle on the stir plate. Mix in 6 g Tryptone, 3 g yeast extract, 9 g agar, and 6 g NaCl. Ensure the solution has been mixed thoroughly and standardize the pH meter with the neutral standard solution. Add 2M NaOH to the solution dropwise until the pH reaches 7.  Check the water level in the autoclave and put autoclave tape on the bottle. Ensure the lid is on but not tightened. Put the bottle in the autoclave and tighten the door. Set it for the liquid cycle and wait until the cycle is over and the pressure reaches 0 to open the door. Put the bottle back on the stir plate and turn it to a low setting to prevent bubbles forming. Let the mixture cool until you can touch the bottle for several seconds comfortably. Add 600 µL of the chosen antibiotic (at 50 mg/mL) to the bottle. Label all plates before you begin to pour. Wearing a glove, use the aseptic technique to pour the media into the plates and leave them to solidify.  To make liquid media stock, the same procedure can be followed without adding agar or antibiotic and then storing in a 4°C fridge. <EM>Adapted from Dr. Irene Reizman and Prather Labs, MIT</EM></DIV><DIV class="prot" id="prot2"> Dry Ice Baths </DIV><DIV class="num" id="2"> There are a few uses for dry ice baths in biology. They are typically made of 70% 
ethanol and dry ice so that the solution gets extremely cold without immediately evaporating. Dry ice baths are used for snap-freezing stock cells that are typically stored in a -80°C freezer, or to cool down various things in the lab. <P style="font-weight:bold">Materials </P><UL><LI>95% ethanol (this is what we had in stock but any percentage can be used if diluted correctly)</LI><LI> Pressurized CO2 container</LI><LI>Dewar Flask</LI></UL><P style="font-weight:bold"> Procedure </P>
Diluting 95% ethanol 
The basic ratio is approximately 70 mL of 95% ethanol diluted with 25 mL of water.
This ratio can be multiplied for the volume necessary for the dewar, which is approximately 500-550 mL of solution.
This turns out to be 350 or 420 mL of 95% ethanol mixed with 125 or 150 mL of pure water, respectively. 
Carefully make dry ice or seek help from someone who can. Put it in a safe container. Not a lot of dry ice is necessary to cool down the ethanol in the dewar.
Add the dry ice a LITTLE at a time, so the ethanol doesn't bubble over and make a mess.
Do not handle dry ice without a glove or something to protect your skin or breathe it in.
Put the lid back on the dewar to keep the solution cool and prevent evaporation. <EM>Adapted from Dr. Irene Reizman and Prather Labs, MIT</EM></DIV><DIV class="prot" id="prot3"> Gel Electrophoresis </DIV><DIV class="num" id="3"> Gel electrophoresis is a quick way to determine the relative sizes of DNA pieces.

Add DI H2O to a flask
Add Agarose 
To make .5%: use .25 g Agarose to 50 mL TBE Buffer
To make 1%: use .50 g Agarose to 50 mL TBE Buffer
To make 1.5%: use .75 g Agarose to 50 mL TBE Buffer
To make 2%: use 1 g Agarose to 50 mL TBE Buffer This table was adapted from: http://schepartzlab.yale.edu/intranet/protocols/AgaroseGelElectrophores.pdf 
Add 1x TBE buffer and microwave until it begins to boil. If the solution is not totally clear (i.e. still has swirls in it) heat it again. Let the solution cool for a couple minutes and add 1 µL of Gel Red to the flask. Ensure the mold is turned so the walls are keeping the gel from running out. Pour the solution into the mold and add the well maker. 
Running Gels 
Rotate the &quot;submarine&quot; (the piece holding the gel) so that the wells are closer to the black end (&quot;run to red&quot;). Fill the apparatus with 1x TBE buffer until it barely covers the top of the gel. Fill the wells with 10 µL of the desired ladder(s) and 10 µL of the desired DNA, mixed with 4 µL of loading dye. Put the lid on and hook up the red and black cables, then turn on the electricity to let the gels run at an appropriate voltage.

After lunch, each team gave a short presentation and answered questions about their project. Then, we went on a tour of the Michigan State University iGEM team’s lab and facilities. Through this meetup, we made connections with other teams and have already started collaborating with the Michigan State team.</DIV><DIV class="event" id="event1"> Ampacet Visit - 7/3/18 </DIV><DIV class="entry" id="entry1"> On July 3rd, Emilie and Liz spoke with a representative from Ampacet in Terre Haute about our project. As a plastics expert, Dr. Jared Tatum explained the processes that are done at Ampacet. While discussing our project, Dr. Tatum offered the team PET plastic samples for our experiments. He will be giving us pure PET bottles, PET pellets, and PET powder. After explaining our experimental protocol ideas, Dr. Tatum advised us to change our procedures. Our original idea had been to let the bacteria eat the pellets as their only carbon source and observe the change. However, Dr. Tatum advised that we use the powder instead of the pellets because of the greater surface area to volume ratio. Additionally, he informed the team about the effect that humidity plays on the characteristics of pure PET. He encouraged us to monitor the humidity during our experiments and note any change in results based on a difference in humidity. Because pure PET is so susceptible to changes based on humidity, PET used in disposable water bottles contain a great amount of additives to stabilize the plastic and ensure long shelf life. Based on this new information, we began designing an experiment that would determine the effects of these additives on the ability of the bacteria to breakdown the PET. </DIV><DIV class="event" id="event3"> Skype Call with Michigan State University iGEM - 7/9/18 </DIV><DIV class="entry" id="entry3"> On July 9th, Ariel, Brittany, Kaylee, and Elisa held a Skype conference with the Michigan State University team. During the Midwest Meetup, they showed interest in collaborating with us on lab and modeling aspects. We learned from the Skype meeting that they needed help creating a mathematical model and protein visualization model for their active site mutagenesis of ACC Deaminase. As our team had skills in creating mathematical models, we offered to help them create a system of differential equations to describe their system’s kinetics and genetics. The protein visualization was not something that we were very familiar with, so they decided to pursue other venues for help on that. In return, they offered to run a couple of our experiments involving their scanning electron microscope, as the one in our lab is not as sophisticated. After the call, they followed up with research articles with information we requested as necessary for building the model. We hope to have another call to discuss our results and coordinate our needs for the scanning electron microscope.</DIV><DIV class="event" id="event4"> Survey Revision with Dr. Timothy Chow - 7/19/18 </DIV><DIV class="entry" id="entry4"> On July 19th, Kaylee, Emilie, and Ariel met with Dr. Timothy Chow to discuss our community survey. He gave us some great suggestions on our survey draft, including that at the beginning, we should include why people should take the time to fill out our survey. He discussed the plausibility of reaching a large enough population to consider the sample a global representation, and we decided we will stick to a more limited population size, trying to reach staff and students from the four colleges in our community as well as other members of our local community, Terre Haute, Indiana. He also gave us advice on how we could shorten our survey while still obtaining the information we’re interested in by having respondents select one of our three implementation methods at the beginning of the survey and only answering further questions about that particular method. He presented us with some local contacts who might be able to help distribute our survey in the community. Finally, he helped us identify the questions that might be too broad or unclear to respondents. He suggested in instances where we refer to “current recycling methods,” we should provide an example for those who might feel unaware of recycling methods. </DIV><DIV class="event" id="event5"> Recycling Interview with Dr. Diane Evans - 7/19/18 </DIV><DIV class="entry" id="entry5"> On July 19th, Ariel and Brittany met with Dr. Evans about her Six Sigma class and their campaigns to make the campus more sustainable. The class is geared towards teaching students through a 10-week long project, quantitatively measuring, and statistically improving a policy. Two of the class projects included decreasing the percentage of waste produced on campus by recycling plastic bottles and substituting plastic straws with biodegradable ones. Both projects have been successful, but the plastic straw project especially was a hit. She has been interviewed on local TV networks and had several articles published about the work. She worked closely with our food service provider and they have recently announced instituting biodegradable straws across all their centers. In our interview, Dr. Evans talked about her inspiration, the generally encouraging feedback about projects, challenges the class met, and what the next steps would be for the class projects. She also provided contacts for more recycling people in the community and insight based on her experience on probable responses to the three proposed implementation methods for our project.  </DIV><DIV class="event" id="event7"> Skype Call with University of Michigan Team - 7/25/18 </DIV><DIV class="entry" id="entry7"> Ariel and Brittany met with University of Michigan iGEM team on video call to talk with them about their project. They were working with a Cas9 system and had questions about how it could be modeled. We were able to give them initial steps on approaching the problem and explained mass-action kinetics to them. After the meeting, we followed up with an email with resources we used for our model and a presentation breaking down simple generic examples of genetics and enzyme kinetics. </DIV><DIV class="event" id="event6"> Follow up with Michigan State Team - 7/31/18 </DIV><DIV class="entry" id="entry6"> On July 31st, Brittany, Ariel, and Elisa did a follow up meeting with the iGEM team from Michigan State University to talk about the model we created for them. They understood the model presentation we created and sent to them, so they had few questions. We are going to stay in contact in case they encounter questions about running the code and/or finding parameter values. We also discussed new collaboration ideas for them to help us get parts into our plasmid. As the lab work has not progressed to the point where we can use their scanning electron microscope, they are willing to try helping us get plasmid 1 created using Gibson Assembly. </DIV><DIV class="event" id="event8"> Skype Call with Yale Team - 8/6/18 </DIV><DIV class="entry" id="entry8"> Kaylee, Brittany, and Ariel skyped with the Yale iGEM team to talk about our projects. Both of our teams are making cells that secrete the enzymes PETase and MHETase to break down PET plastic. They have had more success in the lab than we have, so we were able to ask some questions about how they got their plasmid working. They also suggested we try Gibson Assembly and ligation independent cloning for our plasmid. Additionally, they told us they were finding more success with the yebF secretion tag than some of the others they had tried, like our pelB secretion tag. We were able to answer some questions for them about the modeling we had done, our outreach plans, and other work on our wiki. </DIV><DIV class="event" id="event9"> End of Summer Presentation at Research Symposium - 8/10/18 </DIV><DIV class="entry" id="entry9"> Liz, Kaylee, Elisa, and Ariel did a 7 minute presentation at the Rose-Hulman Undergraduate Research Symposium on the basic premise of our iGEM project, focusing mainly on the development of the plasmids, the problem it addresses, and predictions made by the system’s model. Following the presentation, we answered questions from students and faculty about the project, most of which were geared toward how this could be implemented safely. It was a great opportunity to educate the campus community about our project and get live feedback about areas of concern. One of the biggest concerns people shared was how we planned to keep our bacteria from escaping loosely into the environment. One concerned student asked, “what if your bacteria ate my milk jug and my milk spilled everywhere?” We can use the feedback from this experience to better inform our implementation methods.
</DIV><DIV class="event" id="event10"> Tribune-Star Phone Interview and Article -  8/13/18 </DIV><DIV class="entry" id="entry10"> Ariel contacted recycling advocate and local newspaper columnist Jane Santucci as part of reaching the community with our survey. She not only agreed to share our survey link with her social media followers, she offered to write a column in the Tribune-Star on our team, project, and survey. We were very grateful, and following the phone interview, a column in the Sunday newspaper appeared. This was a wonderful opportunity to reach the community about current recycling, synthetic biology, and our team’s efforts to involve the community with our implementation plans. </DIV><DIV class="event" id="event11"> Terre Haute Children’s Museum Exhibition - 9/1/18 </DIV><DIV class="entry" id="entry11"> Kaylee, Liz, Ariel, and Elisa did a hands-on exhibit at our local children’s museum to teach about DNA structure and our project. We worked with the children to create color coded “DNA” bracelets, where they would match the bases, or beads, on two strings. Those were then made into bracelets and necklaces. They also had the opportunity to read our PEBBLE comic book. The parents were involved by helping the bead matching and asking questions about our project. The team got to talk face-to-face with the community about the project, hear their thoughts, and teach the future generations about cool biology. </DIV><DIV class="event" id="event12"> Modeling Lecture for a Rose-Hulman Biomathematic Class - 9/13/18 </DIV><DIV class="entry" id="entry12"> The iGEM team was invited to present on modeling aspects of the project to the Rose-Hulman BMTH 295 class. Ariel created the presentation and gave a lecture to students and professors on the development and results of our team’s project and the modeling predictions. This gave us the opportunity to inform the larger campus of iGEM and its opportunities for interested students. </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
