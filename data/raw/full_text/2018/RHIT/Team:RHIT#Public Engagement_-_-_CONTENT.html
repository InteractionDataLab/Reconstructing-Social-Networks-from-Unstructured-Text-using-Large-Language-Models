She read our comic book with Pebble the superhero and talked about how important it is to recycle and help with the environment. The kids loved it and were really excited about the story.
	Emilie also went to visit Seton Catholic high school and talk to a class about the project. She talked about the design and how we are working to make our idea become a reality in the lab. 
</P><P> On September 1, the team went to the Terre Haute Childrenâ€™s museum to interact with the kids in the community and introduce them to some STEM and biology ideas. We had an activity for the kids where they were able to make their very own DNA bracelets using different colored beads. Each of the four colored beads represented one of the bases (A,T,C,G) that make DNA. The team taught the kids about what DNA is and how it makes us unique compared to everyone else on the planet.  The team was also able to talk about the PEBBLE project that we have been doing over the summer and what our goals are for the endpoint of it. The kids were very engaged and loved making their bracelets. </P></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><H1> Comic Book </H1></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><H1> Pebble Stuffed Animals </H1><P> We also sewed and stuffed 20 handmade stuffed animals of our superhero PEBBLE that we gave out during our project. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
