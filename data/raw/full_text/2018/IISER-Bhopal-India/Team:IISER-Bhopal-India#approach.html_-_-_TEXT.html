Our Approach - Motivation, Methodology, and Expected Pay-Offs
The goal of developing MethNote was to build a cost effective and reliable detector for local levels of methane. As laid down is our ‘idea’ section, the aim was to introduce the genes needed to convert methane to methanol into our chassis Pichia pastoris along with a sensor for detecting levels of methanol.
The main problem we were facing was that the enzyme needed to convert methane to methanol (from organism), sMMO- soluble methane monooxygenase, consists of 6 genes. So, a traditional cloning approach would not be viable since we needed to find 6 vectors carrying unique antibiotic resistance markers to clone the genes into. Such a stock of vectors is simply not commercially available. Hence, we needed to reduce the number of vectors. A logical idea was to increase the number of genes being cloned into one vector and so we decided to use the Soeing PCR method to join 2 genes together and put them into one vector carrying a unique antibiotic marker. This brought the number of vectors required down to three and we settled upon using shuttle vectors for E. Coli and P. pastoris carrying the resistance markers for kanamycin, hygromycin and zeocin, all proven to inhibit growth of P. pastoris at certain concentrations.
An immediate problem which we saw was that these vectors were used to only clone a single gene since they contained a unique promoter and terminator sequences. Our idea was to clone the terminator sequence and put it after gene 1 and clone the promoter sequence behind gene 2. After that we would use Soeing PCR and complementary overhangs to amplify the product containing the two genes along with their own promoters and terminators and ligate that into our vectors.
For the methanol reporter, we decided to clone the eRFP gene into the vector pHILD-2 carrying the AOX promoter, which would sense methanol, and also carrying His marker. To select this vector after cloning, we decided to use the P. pastoris strain GS115 which is a His mutant.
After we got the Soeing products cloned into the vectors, we would co transform them into the yeast and grow them in media containing the chosen antibiotics. These cells would be harvested and we would check for protein production using Western Blotting assay along with anti-His antibody since all the sMMO genes are already tagged with His-6 tag at the C terminus.
The final step would be to clone the reporter construct into the Pichia and grow them in minimal media containing the chosen antibiotic supplemented with Histidine and sorbitol and lacking glucose since glucose is known to inhibit transcription from the AOX promoter but sorbitol allows it.
These cells would be grown in chambers containing fixed amounts of methane to air ratio and the fluorescence would be measured for each to help calibrate out device for use in the field.
An alternate Strategy
During the course of our experiments, we came across the viral peptide 2A (P2A) system which has the potential of reducing the number of required plasmids even further. 2A peptides are about 20 amino acids long and when they are Inserted between 2 genes in an eukaryotic system, they cause the ribosome to skip the formation of a peptide bond, thus creating 2 polypeptides from the same mRNA chain (just like in prokaryotes). The beauty is that no separate promoters or terminators are required for each separate gene which saves a lot of space in the plasmid.
We are planning to use the P2A system as an alternative to the Soeing system by ordering premade constructs from IDT. These constructs would contain 3 sMMO genes each along with P2A sites in between. The constructs would be made such that the total size is less than 2KB (since that is the maximum size permissible for a GBlock from IDT).
These gblocks would be amplified and simply cloned into the desired vectors for expression in P. pastoris.
