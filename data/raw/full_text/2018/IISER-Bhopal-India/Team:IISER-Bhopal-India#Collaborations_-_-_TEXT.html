Team Germany Aachen
A successful collaboration was established based on the fact that both our teams are aiming to employ yeast in order to design a biosensor. Our project is focussed on an effective methane sensor development through synthetic biology and metabolic modelling. Team Aachen had some queries regarding the significance of their project in terms of biosafety. The team was also concerned regarding the significance of melatonin in the study of the stability of DNA in neurodegenerative disorders. They enquired whether their facilitated measuring method of melatonin was helpful in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. We helped answer their questions with the help of Dr. Puneet Gandhi who was a part of the biosafety meeting that we had arranged on our campus.
Team Aachen also shared their project description with us, which revealed their use of Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) technique to develop a melatonin sensor which would sense the presence of melatonin from saliva samples. This helped us understand as to how a biosensor development is to be done.
The information we received from their team significantly helped us begin the process of model building. Mr. Jan suggested the use of SimBiology tools for model building to build a gene regulation model for a chassis organism using MATLAB. This turned out to be of great help for us as our metabolic modelling part of the project was initiated with help of team Aachen.  We helped spread the word about their project on the “iGEM Day” that we organized in our institute and the same was done by Team Aachen on their side. Video calls were held with their team to discuss both our projects’ applications and the possibility of marketization of our biosensing technology.
Team Bioilluminati IIT Kanpur
Our team had interactive sessions with the iGEM team from IIT Kanpur. Both our projects are in environmental track and thus we actively discussed and exchanged project ideas and their plausible effects. During these sessions, we discussed our methodology, upcoming strategies and helped troubleshoot each other's issues. Both of our teams worked together in human practices and outreach programs. We shared their project with a broader audience and talked about its significance by making it part of the outreach we conducted, thus ensuring that we both could successfully get our project ideas imprinted on the minds of people across different regions.
Team ICT Mumbai
Our team had a successful collaboration with ICT-Mumbai. Upon discussion, we helped them troubleshoot their overlap extension PCR by sharing two of the protocols that had worked in our case. We also showcased their project along with other teams at Synbio Symposium as a part of iGEM Day.
Additionally, we also tried using a basic software developed by them - 'BBRICKIT' which biobricks any DNA sequences, checks illegal sites and suggests sequential changes.
Team Tec-CEM Mexico
We had an interactive session with the team Tec-CEM of Mexico. We discussed our projects in detail.  It was very informative and inspiring to talk about the significance of our projects and its impact at a global level. We took part in their video collaborations  “Labs like you”, where we sent our contribution to the video. Additionally, we collaborated with them on the human practices section. We presented their work along with ours, during the 'iGEM Day' that we had organized in our institute.
All India iGEM Meetup 2018
We had a successful collaboration with IISc Bangalore’s iGEM team, which had hosted a two-day All India iGEM meet-up. The scientific sessions were intense with talks followed by discussions on respective projects.
We presented our poster and delivered a talk at the meet. Out of 11 teams from India, 8 teams attended the meetup, and our project secured 96 percentile as per the judges, having garnered significant attention from many of the teams. This meetup helped us enhance our project status by many constructive personalized feedbacks received from the experts.
iGEM Day
At iGEM Day we showcased projects of all Indian iGEM teams and other collaborators. We got an overwhelming response from the teams and the community members. Here is a list of teams who collaborated with us on iGEM Day.
