Carefully place the membrane in a pack and add primary antibody (1:500,1:1000), while sealing it make sure the all the bubbles are removed.
Then the pack was kept on a rocker for 2 hr and then remove the primary antibody. Wash the blot by keeping it on the rocker with TBST for 7 min. Repeat this step twice.
Now again keep the Blot carefully on the pack and add secondary antibody (1:10,000) while sealing it make sure the all the bubbles are removed. This was kept on a rocker for another 45 min without exposing it to light.
