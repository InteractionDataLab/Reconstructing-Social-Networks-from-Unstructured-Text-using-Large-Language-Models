Heading to be added
Optimization of methane utilization by Pichia pastoris is to be done.
Once optimised, P.pastoris will serve as a robust system for methane detection in industry.
Our future work strategy involves flanking each antibiotic resistance gene with LoxP sites and introducing the Cre recombinase under an inducible promoter. Upon addition of appropriate inducer, the translated Cre enzyme would chop off the floxed DNA. Hence rendering our initially recombinant Pichia pastoris sensitive to the antibiotics present in its growth media.The Cre-Lox system basically would act as a kill-switch in case our recombinant chassis organism becomes hazardous for the environment.
The genetically modified P. pastoris can then be utilised for:
Methanol Assimilation
The microbial route of methanol biosynthesis first involves oxidation of methane to methanol through the sMMO complex. This process is energy dependent and uses NADH. The methanol gets further oxidized to formaldehyde by NADH-independent methanol oxidase/dehydrogenase activity.
Production of Methanol as a biofuel
Sodium formate solution can be used for NADH regeneration and hence eventually rapid methanol biosynthesis by increasing the conversion of Methane to methanol. Also a Mut- strain of P. pastoris (NAME) has been found to be inhibiting methanol oxidation. That high concentration of phosphate ions (>80 mM) selectively inhibited methanol oxidation activity in  M. trichosporium cells. This lead to extracellular methanol accumulation.[1] All these helps to increase the production and accumulation of methanol by Pichia, making it a potent biofuel producer.
