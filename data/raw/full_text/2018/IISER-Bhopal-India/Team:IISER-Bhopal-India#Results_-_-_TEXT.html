Gene Splicing by Overlap Extension PCR
Parts and vector confirmation:
BioBrick parts obtained from iGEM Repository and vectors ordered from AddGene were confirmed by their transformation into competent DH5α strain of E.coli and subsequent plasmid isolation from the obtained colonies.
Figure 1 (a) Single Digestion Confirmation of parts procured from iGEM repository -  Plasmids encoding subunits of sMMO complex procured from iGEM repository [Bba_K139007:sMMO B_pSB1C3 (2312kB), Bba_K139008:sMMO C_pSB1C3 (3047bp), Bba_K139009:sMMO D_pSB1C3 (2312bp), Bba_K139010:sMMO X_pSB1C3 (3584bp), Bba_K139011:sMMO Y_pSB1C3 (3170bp), Bba_K139012:sMMO Z_pSB1C3 (2510bp), Bba_K139013:AOXP-RFP_pSB1C3 (3577bp)] were single-digested with EcoRI restriction enzyme for size confirmation.  Incubated at 37’C for 1hr and the digestion products were run on 1% Agarose gel.
(b) Isolation and purification of pGKB plasmid - A Pichia pastoris expression vector pGKB (3506bp) procured from AddGene was isolated and purified by miniprep and run on 1% agarose gel for validation
PCR Amplification of parts to be cloned:
PCR amplification of sMMO D and sMMO X genes using appropriate primers (IDT) with overhangs containing restriction sites necessary for cloning into pGKB along with kozak sequence for protein expression in Pichia was done.
Gel Electrophoresis was done for the amplified parts and DNA bands were visualized. Bands of proper sizes were observed which confirmed the size of the parts.
Figure 2 PCR Amplification of sMMO Subunits - Genes for sMMO D (312bp) and sMMO X (1584bp) were PCR amplified from parts procured from iGEM repository, purified and run on 1% Agarose gel for validation
sMMO D and sMMO X cloned in pGKB Vector:
Genes for MMO subunits-sMMO D and sMMO X- obtained after PCR Amplification and pGKB Vector were digested with Restriction Enzymes NgoMIV and SalI  at 37ºC  overnight. Digested DNA was purified by Gel Elution purification and ligation was setup followed by transformation into competent DH5α E.coli cells. Plasmid was isolated from the obtained colonies and confirmed by Agarose Gel Electrophoresis.
The cloned plasmid sMMO D_pGKB (pGKB with sMMO D gene flanked by GAP Promoter and AOX Terminator) was confirmed by double digestion with NgoMIV and SalI and sMMO X_pGKB (pGKB with sMMO X gene flanked by GAP Promoter and AOX Terminator) with SacII and EcoRI. Bands of appropriate sizes were observed after Agarose Gel Electrophoresis which confirmed the cloning of sMMO D and sMMO X in pGKB.

This confirmed the cloning of sMMO D in pGKB as well. Also, genes for sMMO X and AOX Terminator were PCR amplified from sMMO X_pGKB recombinant plasmid similarly. These were confirmed by observing bands of appropriate sizes after Agarose Gel Electrophoresis.

Antibiotic Sensitivity Assay
Antibiotic Sensitivity Assay for Pichia pastoris for G418:
Pichia pastoris was grown in different concentrations of the antibiotic G418 to determine the optimum concentration of the antibiotic to be used for selection of the transformed yeast. O.D.600 of the culture was recorded at different time points with antibiotic concentrations ranging from 100μg/ml to 500μg/ml and plotted against time. The results obtained were analysed and 300μg/ml was found to be optimal for selection of the transformed yeast as the growth of the original untransformed strain was restricted in that concentration.   Further yeast transformations were done using plates with 300μg/ml G418.
Figure 9 G418 Antibiotic Sensitivity Assay for Pichia pastoris - Growth of Pichia pastoris cells was recorded in liquid YPD media with different G418 concentration at 30'C for 24hrs using an automated plate reader. The average cell density (OD600) of three independent isolates per G418 concentrationwith error bar was plotted against different time points to obtain a growth curve suggesting optimum G418 concentration sensitive for P. pastoris

Digested DNA was purified by Gel Elution purification and ligation was setup followed by transformation into competent DH5α E.coli cells. Plasmid was isolated from the obtained colonies and confirmed by Agarose Gel Electrophoresis. The cloned plasmid P2A1_pGKB (pGKB with P2A1 insert flanked by GAP Promoter and AOX Terminator) was confirmed by double digestion with EcoRI and KpnI.
