We’d like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who, directly or indirectly, have contributed into making this project a success. Our institute IISER-Bhopal, Founder Director- Prof. Vinod K Singh, Department of Biological Sciences and IICE have provided us with all the support since inception of the project.
We had procured seven BioBrick iGEM parts previously submitted by Team Braunschweig 2014 and Team Brazil 2013 from the Registry for the purpose of our project. We would like to sincerely acknowledge these teams for the same.
Professors
Dr. Vikas Jain (Associate professor, Department of Biological Sciences)
With his expertise in molecular biology techniques, he helped us troubleshoot our PCR reactions.   His unconditional and immense support helped us speed up the molecular lab work with precision and maintain our lab records better. He has helped us in lyophilizing our DNA samples for submission.
Dr. Apurba Lal Koner (Assistant professor, Department of Chemistry)
He gave honest critical reviews about the optimisation of our biosensor model in terms of its detection time, durability and tolerance for temperature, pH and salt concentration during various adverse field conditions. He also discussed the limitations of using RFP as a reporter molecule and suggested to explore other possible, improved fluorophores
Dr. Nagarjun Vijay (Assistant professor, Department of Biological Sciences)
Being an ex-iGEMer himself (Uppsala University, 2010), Dr. Vijay gave us initial insights into how iGEM teams work and the extensiveness of funding iGEM projects. He has helped in the development of the metabolic model for MethNote.
Dr. Ankur Gupta (Assistant professor, Department of Chemistry)
He expressed his concerns regarding the use of antibiotics leading to development of multidrug resistance and hence, the sustainability of such a project. He recommended us to check for other pathways in our chassis organism that might affect our designated Promoter-reporter construct.
Labwork
Dr. Sunando Datta (HoD, Department of Biological Sciences) and Dr. Himanshu Kumar (Lab In-charge, Biology UG lab) for providing us with the resources and the departmental UG lab as our workspace for extended hours.
Ms. Latika Agarwal (Project Lab Assistant, Bio UG Lab) for helping us to get started in the lab.
Mr. Preetam Meena and Mr. Sunil Meena (Lab attendants) for helping us around the lab.
Ms. Manali Powar, Mr. Anish Ganju, Mr. Prajwal Bhardwaj and Ms. Rucha Kulkarni (Students) for extending their help to the team in lab work whenever we needed an extra set of hands.
iGEM support
Abigail Sison (Ambassador to Australasia, iGEM Foundation)
She helped us in ordering the iGEM parts and kit. She made an exception for sending the two inconsistent parts at our request.
Vinoo Selvarajah (Director of the registry, iGEM Foundation)
Being our iGEM HQ Representative, he helped us clear specific queries regarding the iGEM registry parts and medal criteria along with informing us the important deadlines from time to time.
Snehal Kadam (Official Mentor)
She joined us under the mentorship program of After-iGEM community. She has helped us understand iGEM’s medal criteria better, conversed with iGEM HQ on our behalf and also helped us troubleshoot some of our wet-lab strategies. Mentorship Reports
Wiki Support
Mr. Keshav Hibare (Web Designer)
Also an enthusiastic senior, he has invested his skills and hours to help create our wiki page from scratch. Apart from the work, he kept the lab lively when we were trying to adjust to Boston Time Zone by working overnight!
Mr. Akhil Phadnis (Project Office Associate, Student affairs)
We received immense support from him regarding understanding the technical aspects of our wiki. He also helped us debug the website.
We thank all these students- Sreepadmanabh M & Manav Mishra (chief editors), Sushmita Pal, Radhika Mishra, Gourilekshmi Hari, and Bhushan Thipe for having helped us through several rounds of editing for our content on Wiki Page.
Human Practices
Dr. Neetu Kalra and Dr. Shyam Sunder Reddy (Project Lab Instructors)  for judging the ‘Battle of Wits’, the debate competition held on iGEM Day.
Dr. Amit Verma (Senior Scientist, Indian Institute of Toxicology Research) for having critically analysed the project and suggesting alternative ways to approach the problem.
Dr. Dhanyalekshmi Pillai (Assistant professor, Department of EES) for providing her views with respect to practical limitations and future design for MethNote.
Dr. Madhumita Mukherjee (Scientific officer) for providing permission to conduct outreach program for MethNote along with Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan.
Mr. Dhananjay Kumar (Alumni, IISER Bhopal) helped us understand the limitations of our initial work strategy and hence, suggested cloning using viral 2A peptides.
Administrative Support
Ms. Shweta Saxena (Junior Assistant) and Mr. Yashpal Jain (Project Office Assistant) for helping us register our project in the Institute Research and Development office.
Mr. Arun Thapar (Business Development Manager, IICE) for helping us manage the finances of our project through IICE.
Dr. Sandeep Pathak (Deputy Librarian, IISER Bhopal) for helping us cross check all our documents submitted on a fundraising platform for plagiarism using Turnitin.

MetaBioSys Group- Dr. Vineet K Sharma (Associate professor, Department of Biological Sciences)
Our Primary Investigator’s lab has been the backbone in getting most of the documentation work done, receiving orders for us and letting us access services from lab (Thermocycler, 4°C refrigerator, incubator).
Special Thanks to Ms.Rituja Saxena and Ms. Shruti Mahajan for helping us with sequencing concepts and providing the consumables and documents at times when our PI was not around. All the lab members extended full support throughout our project.
Sahi laboratory- Dr. Chandan Sahi (Assistant professor, Department of Biological Sciences)
Talk about any enzyme, antibiotic, vector or competent cell vial used during the preliminary results and in the due course of the project- the members were of immense help.
Special thanks to Mr. Yogesh Tak, Ms. Chetana Tamadaddi and Ms. Kripa Yadav who were always around to guide us through lab techniques. Ms. Chetana Tamaddi helped us with transformation when we really needed an expert’s hand.
