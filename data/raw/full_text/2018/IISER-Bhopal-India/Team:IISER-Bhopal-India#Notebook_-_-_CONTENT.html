		This phase of lab work mainly consisted of preparing the necessary buffer stocks and other necessary components such as antibiotic plates, primer stocks etc. Apart from this, preparation for <I>E. coli</I> DH5alpha super competent cells was also initiated. All the lab consumables (autoclaved or not) such as LB, LBA, MCTs, Culture tubes, Plates, PCR tubes etc. prepared as and when required subsequently. Part 1 of Interlab study i.e. the Ludox-cl calibration curve was completed as well. To make sure the lab work maintained the pace, even in absence of our freshly prepared super competent cells, we borrowed a few vials of super competent cells from the Sahi lab and transformed them with the sMMO subunits received from iGEM in the pSB1C3 vector (Chloramphenicol marker). The stabs received from Addgene were also streaked and the vectors (pGKB- Kanamycin marker and pGHYB- Hygromycin marker) were isolated and stored. Glycerol stock of the stabs prepared and stored as well.</P><H3>Calendar Week 25-26 (18/06/2018-01/07/2018) </H3><P align="justify" style="font-family:'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size:16px; font-weight:300; line-height:1.6em; color:#656565;">
		Part 2 and 3 of Interlab study i.e. the silica beads Calibration curve and the Fluorescein Calibration curve was completed in this week. Along with this, we also completed the cell measurement and the CFU protocol, thus completing the Interlab study successfully. Yet we decided to recheck and troubleshoot a few steps by repeating them.</P><P align="justify" style="font-family:'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size:16px; font-weight:300; line-height:1.6em; color:#656565;">Also pSB1C3 containing sMMO subunits and the AOX-RFP promoter-reporter construct was also isolated from the transformed cells and along with Addgene vectors, were confirmed by restriction digestion.These plasmids were used as template for PCR amplification and subsequent gel elution using primers with necessary overhangs to introduce restriction sites of interest in the parts they contained (sMMO subunits and AOX-RFP promoter-reporter construct). All of the parts were successfully amplified except for sMMO Z as it was an inconsistent part and we only obtained by request. Work carried forward with only sMMO D, sMMO X and sMMO Y as we still hadn’t gone around to circularise the pGAPZ vector for sMMO B and sMMO C, synthesized as gBlock from IDT. Attempt 1 for single cloning of sMMO D and X in pGKB failed at colony picking stage as there were no colonies. sMMO Y couldn’t be cloned into pGHYB as one of the restriction sites introduced for cloning already existed inside the part. Thus we repeated the cloning for sMMO D and X in pGKB after making sure DNA hadn’t degraded and set up controls as well. There was no growth, not even in positive control.</P><P align="justify" style="font-family:'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size:16px; font-weight:300; line-height:1.6em; color:#656565;">Part 2 and 3 of Interlab study i.e. the silica beads calibration curve and the Fluorescein calibration curve was completed in this week.

Attempt 1 (Protocol 1 for SOEing) for sewing sMMO D with AOX terminator and GAP Promoter with sMMO X using SOEing PCR yielded a positive result for sMMO D with AOX terminator but failed for sMMO X with GAP Promoter. sMMO D with AOX terminator was purified and cloned into pGKB (Attempt 1) while troubleshooting SOEing PCR for sMMO X with GAP Promoter

First Pichia transformation of sMMO D and sMMO X genes in pGKB vector (recombinant vector after cloning) attempted by two protocols out of which Classical LiAc protocol was preferred for further transformations. Transformed colonies showed some contamination which was further analysed and discussed with our PI. Attempted PCR amplification of the mmoZ and mmoY using the new IDT primers.

Also originally digested gBlocks were set up for a repeat ligation all the while screening colonies for AOX-RFP from the original transformed plates.

Amplified parts were gel purified and cloned into pSB1C3. gBlocks P2A1, P2A2 and AOX-iLOV were also cloned into pSB1C3 with the prefix and suffix enzymes.</P><P align="justify" style="font-family:'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size:16px; font-weight:300; line-height:1.6em; color:#656565;">Apart from traditional cloning strategy i.e. double Digestion→ Purification→ Ligation→ Transformation, 3A assembly was also used to create a composite part with GAP promoter-sMMO D- AoxT and Aox promoter-iLOV into pSB1C3. </P><P align="justify" style="font-family:'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size:16px; font-weight:300; line-height:1.6em; color:#656565;">Out of all the above-mentioned cloning- only P2A1, P2A2 and GAP promoter-sMMO D- AoxT and Aox promoter-iLOV were successful as confirmed by restriction digestion.

Most of the transformants were plagued with unidentified bacterial contamination. Transformed colonies from the contaminated plates were repatched to obtain single colonies. These colonies were checked by microscopy which showed the presence of Pichia but some contamination still persisted. We re-checked the Pichia obtained in stab format and slight contamination in the stab was speculated which may have been causing the problem. Transformed Pichia was grown with Ampicillin added in the medium along with the G418 antibiotic to avoid growth of further contaminant (if it was similar to E.coli) but with no success. This problem needs to be addressed further for proper protein expression studies in our chassis organism. Simultaneously, the transformation of our recombinant plasmids was set up in <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I> as it resembled our chassis organism. Obtained colonies were checked for protein expression by Western Blotting using the anti-HIS antibody as a probe.</P><P align="justify" style="font-family:'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size:16px; font-weight:300; line-height:1.6em; color:#656565;">Contact team for the daily lab record at <B>igemiiserb@gmail.com</B></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><TITLE>iGEM</TITLE><FOOTER><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-6"><DIV class="copyright"><P><A href="https://iice.iiserb.ac.in"><FONT color="gray"> Supported by Innovation and Incubation Cell, IISER Bhopal</FONT></A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
