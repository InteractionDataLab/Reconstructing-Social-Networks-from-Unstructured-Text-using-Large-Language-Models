Why Methane ?
Methane emissions significantly impact the acceleration of global warming. The effects of methane are quite disproportionately high, compared to its actual concentration in contrast with other gases. Despite having a concentration almost 200-fold lesser than CO2,  itâ€™s culprit for over 30% as much global warming as CO2.
One of the biggest anthropogenic contributors to the increasing levels of atmospheric methane  are leakage losses, which may be due to a host of reasons ranging from faulty industrial equipment, ill-maintained pipelines, antiquated spillover control systems, or even due to a simple lack of prompt intervention and control strategies.
Methane Leakages - Heavy Losses, Punishing Effects
The widespread usage of methane for a variety of  applications, most important of which is the ever insatiable energy sector. Leakage losses, which end up being detrimental contributions towards the atmospheric budget of methane, can often get amplified, simply as a result of heavy usage statistics. For instance, even at an emission rate (derived by dividing the amount of methane emitted each year, by the total amount of methane pumped out of the ground each year from natural gas and oil wells) of just over 2.3%, the U.S. Oil and Gas industry was responsible for the generation of 2.3 million metric tons of methane emissions last year. Further perspective can be gained from the fact that in the U.S. alone, there are over 2 million miles of pipelines - that is over 80 times the distance around the earth!
Elementary, My Dear Problems?
Understandably, Ggiven such a large framework and widespread layout, there are abundant opportunities for leakages to occur.
Hence, substantial resources need to be dedicated towards developing robust detection and containment strategies. Very often, a prominent bottleneck in this regard arises within the very first prerequisite itself - accurately detecting a leakage and pinpointing its location within a vast network with a multitude of nodes. Keeping in mind the mind-bogglingly complexity and span of the methane distribution systems currently in place, it is imperative that any such detecting system have at least the following basic properties - reasonable levels of precision, low environmental risks/load, cost-efficient, low-maintenance, and high versatility. Contemporary sensors all face limitations in at least some, and frequently most, of the above criteria.
