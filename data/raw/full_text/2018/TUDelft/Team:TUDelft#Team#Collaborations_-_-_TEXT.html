Team:TUDelft/Team/Collaborations
Welcome to the collaboration page, where we try to connect to different teams all over the world. Throughout the summer, we have made great connections with different teams and helped each other to bring both teamâ€™s projects to an even higher level. Not only did we connect with them from distance, our whole team even went to Shenzhen, China to organize and hold the first ever iGEM EurAsian Meetup together with iGEM BGIC Global . Before you relive the meetup experience on our and iGEM BGIC Global's EurAsian Meetup pages, retrace our collaboration journey by clicking on the stars on the map! Bon voyage!
