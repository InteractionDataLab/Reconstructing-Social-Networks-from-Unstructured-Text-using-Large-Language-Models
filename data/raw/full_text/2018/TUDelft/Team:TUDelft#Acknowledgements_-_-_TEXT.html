Team:TUDelft/Acknowledgements
We have to thank many people that have helped us make our project become a reality. For the past nine months we received a lot of advice from various people, including our supervisors, stakeholders, sponsors and specialists.
While all of the practical work has been performed by the team the execution would not have been possible without all these people. This page is dedicated to everyone who helped us and believed in our project.
Next to everyone who helped we also have a special page for all our sponsors , without whom this project financially would not be possible.
