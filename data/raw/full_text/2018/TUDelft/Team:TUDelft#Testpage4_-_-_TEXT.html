Join us on our race against gene doping!
Previous Next
Rapid developments in synthetic biology continue to offer solutions for multidisciplinary platforms. Gene therapy, as one of the many applications, is a promising method for the rapid improvement of human health. However, with powerful technology comes great responsibility: unethical and undesired applications of synthetic biology have remained prevalent ever since its emergence. Among these, abuse of gene therapy by athletes to improve sports performances, also known as gene doping, is a rising trend as an innovative doping strategy.
