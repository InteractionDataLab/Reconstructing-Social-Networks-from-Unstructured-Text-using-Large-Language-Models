                Prior to doing any actual genomic integration, we performed a broad scala of control experiments. <B class="”jnnbl”">Table 1</B> gives an overview of the results obtained for these controls. The obtained data confirmed that, based on their blue colony phenotype, the parental BL21DE3 strain indeed contained intact and functional <I>lacZ</I>. Furthermore, the parental strain was not found to be resistant to chloramphenicol nor to kanamycin. Harboring the fusion construct and the gRNA that targets <I>lacZ</I>, while not provided with donor DNA, did not influence the functionality of the <I>lacZ</I>, resulting in remaining blue colony phenotype. This discards the potential expressional inhibition effects to to binding of the fusion complex. Furthermore, we took along some controls including Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), which is present by default on iGEM backbone vectors (pSB1K3). Together with blue phenotype, this resulted into a purple colony phenotype.

This indicates that the kanamycin cassette, as well as the RFP cassette were intact and functional. The sequence verification confirmed both sequences were intact and oriented as desired. <I>DH5α</I> was not able to grow on LB+Kan+Cam, and demonstrates the negative control.
    The MEs of the donor DNA (BBa_K2643011) were also sequence verified and confirmed to be located as designed, but we were not able to show that they were recognized and that the donor DNA was integrated, neither in a targeted nor a non-targeted manner. Surviving colonies demonstrated development of purple phenotype, sometimes requiring several days (<B class="”jnnbl”">figure 16</B>), while going through an interesting metamorphosis of color changes. Based on the evaluated controls, it is very likely that a purple phenotype was due to the presence of the original RFP-containing template plasmid used for creating the linear donor DNA sequence. The RFP cassette was kept on the plasmid to observe this deviant purple color to identify growing false positives. These colonies survived in the presence of kanamycin and chloramphenicol, because this template plasmid is propagated and harbors intact and functional chloramphenicol and kanamycin resistance expression cassettes.

These LB+Cam+Kan+X-gal+IPTG plates demonstrate growth of BL21DE3+pACYCdxCas9Tn5gRNA strains that are electroporated with donor DNA. (A) 1 day after electroporation with linear ME flanked kanamycin resistance cassette, blue colony formation was observed, whereas (B) a week later red phenotype has developed strongly. (C) 1 day after transformation with ME flanked kanamycin resistance cassette in a plasmid, blue colony formation was observed, whereas (D) a week later purple phenotype has developed strongly.</FIGCAPTURE><P>Evaluation of colonies by several genomic PCRs have demonstrated that integration did not take place near the desired target site. The negative control used for these genomic PCRs was purified isolated gDNA of the BL21DE3 parent strain. Even transformation of donor DNA into a competent strain harboring only Tn5 did not result in colonies, suggesting a problem related to the transposase effector function of the fusion construct.The experimental results demonstrate that the used kanamycin cassette is functional, judging from the control results. The RFP remains unchanged and functional too, allowing for identification of false positives. Furthermore, we have shown that strain BL21DE3 contains a functional lacZ copy, based on chromogenic conversion of X-gal. 

Although we have shown that MEs are present and intact on the donor DNA sequence, we were not able to show that the MEs were recognized and that the donor DNA was integrated.  We would have expected either targeted or non-targeted integration, but neither occured. Even when we try out the setup with just Tn5 and donor sequence, this yielded no integration.

Two assays were performed to prove the in vitro functionality of the fusion protein:</P><OL class=""><LI>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) verified the ability of fusion protein to load DNA adapter and sgRNA, and form complex with the target DNA (EPO).</LI><LI>Integration assay verified the target specific integration of fusion protein.</LI></OL><B>Results and interpretation:</B>
            We successfully performed EMSA to individual (non-fused) dxCas9 and Tn5 protein (see the <A class="jnnbl" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TUDelft/Notebook" target="_blank">notebook</A>). Next, we performed EMSA to verify that our fusion protein was able to load Cy5-labbelled adapter DNA, sgRNA, and Cy5-labelled target DNA. <B class="”jnnbl”">Figure 17</B> displays the result of the EMSA on 5% TBE native PAGE as shown by the Typhoon Imaging System.

</FIGCAPTURE><P>We performed EMSA for Tn5 and dxCas9 portion of the fusion protein separately. <B class="”jnnbl”">Figure 17A</B> displays the EMSA of adapter. Loading of adapter on the fusion protein retards DNA movement on PAGE, which was observed as higher bands on <B class="”jnnbl”">figure 17A</B>, lane 7 and 8. It indicates that mobility shift occurs when &gt;1.5µM of fusion protein is present. We performed three different negative controls in parallel:

            <UL class=""><LI>No adapter DNA was added (<B class="”jnnbl”">figure 17A</B>, lane 2).</LI><LI>No fusion protein was added (<B class="”jnnbl”">figure 17A</B>, lane 3,4, and 10).</LI><LI>Fusion protein was denatured by heat (<B class="”jnnbl”">figure 17A</B>, lane 9).</LI></UL></P><P>
None of these negative control reactions resulted in the band shift, confirming the specificity of our result.

          With the same principle, higher bands observed on <B class="”jnnbl”">figure 17B</B>, lane 5,6,14, and 15, confirmed the complex formation between sgRNA-loaded fusion protein with the target DNA. As a negative control, the same reaction was carried out without sgRNA. In this case, the dxCas9 should not be able to find the target DNA and complex should not be formed. The absence of higher bands on <B class="”jnnbl”">figure 17B</B>, lane 7-11 confirmed this.

          We performed integration assay based on the protocol. To amplify the integration products, we performed PCR with primers that anneal to the end of adapter DNA, and the beginning or end of target DNA. <B class="”jnnbl”">Figure 18</B> displays the PCR products on 5% TBE native gel.

          We designed the sgRNA to target the second exon-exon junction of EPO cDNA (position ~200bp from total length 623bp). When integration of adapter DNA (length ~50bp) occurs, 2 fragments of ~250bp and ~470bp should be generated. Indeed, <B class="”jnnbl”">figure 18</B> lane 2 and 3 shows intense bands on position ~250bp and ~470bp respectively. This indicated the success of targeted integration by our fusion protein. Moreover, the absence of these bands and the stronger presence of other unspecific bands when sgRNA was omitted (<B class="”jnnbl”">figure 18</B>, lane 4 and 5) or when Tn5 was used (<B class="”jnnbl”">figure 18</B> lane 10 and 11) confirmed that targeted integration is specific to sgRNA targeted fusion protein. Moreover, the absence of integration products on the other negative control (without fusion protein, adapter, or target DNA) on <B class="”jnnbl”">figure 18</B>, lane 6-9, 12, and 13 confirmed this further.</P><FIGCAPTURE class="jnnbl"><B>Figure 18.</B> 5% TBE native PAGE stained by EtBr and imaged by GelDoc system.

</FIGCAPTURE><P>To confirm that these two bands represented the expected integration products, we isolated and sequence verified them. <B class="”jnnbl”">Figure 19</B> shows the sequence alignment between the two fragments and the target EPO gene. From the sequence alignment we can confirm that integration occured upstream the sgRNA binding site. The overlapping alignment between the two products  suggested that integration does not always occur at the exact base pair position (~10bp variation), which might be the result of the flexible linker between dxCas9 and Tn5.

    We prepared a solution with a mix of different DNA molecules that ranged from plasmid to linear DNA of different sizes.

The total number of aligned reads for each reference molecule, presented in <B class="”jnnbl”">figure 21</B> indicated that small linear DNA molecules (600 bp) are not identified during data analysis. This does not mean that these DNA molecules were not read, but their alignment was not possible with our working pipeline, probably due to the size of the reference. These results also indicated that, when DNA molecules are added without the first transposase reaction (the case of PCR 3 that is unadapted), the reads generated are much lower (&gt; 3%) than equimolar concentrations of molecules that were fragmented by the transposase reaction (PCR 1).

</FIGCAPTURE><H5 class="jnnbl">Applying the fusion protein: targeted adapter integration</H5><P><B>Design:</B>
We designed and tested DNA adapters, compatible with ONT sequencing, to be integrated by the Tn5 portion of our fusion protein. We targeted the integration of these adapters on EPO coding sequence in plasmid DNA.<B>Results and interpretation:</B> 
                    The initial assay for adapter (~30bp) integration on plasmid DNA with EPO coding sequence (BBa_K2643004) was not successful (

Based on this result, we hypothesised that it might be necessary to work with linearized DNA, so we digested EPO plasmid with EcoRI enzyme and repeated the adapter integration. Adapter integration with sgRNA (<A class="jnnbl" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TUDelft/Primers" target="_blank">sg001</A>) targeting EPO at around 232th bp should result in fragments of ~250 bp and ~430bp. We PCR amplified the products of integration using EPO and adapters’ primers. The results in <B class="”jnnbl”">figure 22</B>, (Lane 1,2,5, and 6) indicated a correct integration of both adapters in a specific position in EPO cds molecule. The absence of these bands on the negative controls without sgRNA (lane 3,4,7,8) confirmed this specificity further.

For this assay, we took an initial solution with equimolar concentrations of Tn5 DNA and EPO plasmid DNA and performed our integration assay, after which we continued with Rapid Sequencing Kit pipeline (without transposase fragmentation reaction). As a control, an equimolar concentration of dxCas9 DNA was prepared by ONT library preparation protocol (including transposase fragmentation).

Analysis of aligned reads to sample treated with our fusion protein showed zero sequences aligned to Tn5 DNA reference (non-target of our fusion) and 89 reads aligned to the target EPO plasmid DNA. These reads indicated that the integration of sequencing adapters preferred the linearized EPO plasmid DNA rather than Tn5 DNA for sequencing.
