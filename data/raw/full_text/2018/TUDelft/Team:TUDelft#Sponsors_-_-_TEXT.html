We thank the many institutes and companies that have helped us make our project become a reality.                     Without the financial support and support in the form of for example lab equipment, our project                     would not have been able to become a reality.
Next to everyone who helped financially, we also have a special page for all the people who supported our project in other ways.

TU Delft Sports Engineering Institute
What do top-level sports and technology have to do with each other? Everything!                                 Top-level sport is extremely demanding, and not just in physical terms. In order to                                 keep on improving their performances, top-level athletes need to look beyond just their                                 physical capacities; they need to think about clothing and equipment, materials and                                 design. Can it be made faster, higher, with less drag? These are just the kind of                                 questions TU                                     Delft Sports Engineering Institute can provide answers to.
