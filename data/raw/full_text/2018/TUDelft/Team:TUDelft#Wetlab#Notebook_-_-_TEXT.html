10ul of each spiked extraction was loaded on a gel and imaged with the Typhoon. Next to that also 5, 10 and 15 ng of Cy5-labeled EPO where loaded on the gel as reference. Showing that circa 5 ng of Cy5-labeled EPO was present in the 10ul of the extractions. The total extraction volume was 60ul. So circa 5*6=30 ng of Cy5-labeled EPO was present in the final extraction volumes. Showing a roughly 50% extraction efficency, since 60 ng was spiked per sample.      Whereas the difference in cfDNA measurement by using the Qubit would suggest an extraction efficiency of circa 37%. But the three spiked samples were too different from eachother in values, probably due to using a too high concentration of sample for spiking.3

19 tubes were prepared for the EPO PCR, containing the serum extractions of 20/09/2018 as template DNA, two positive controls (linear and BB EPO used for spiking), a negative control with MiliQ as template and a non spiked serum extraction as negative control. The thermocycler programme was installed to have an extension time of 40 seconds and an annealing temperature of 65 °C, 30 cycles. After the programme was finished, samples were kept at 4°C.
The PCR gave positive bands for all the spiked samples. But also for the negative control, the unspiked serum. After redoing of this PCR for the non spiked and spiked samples using the two EPO primer combinations 072+073 and 074+075 it became clear that there was a contamination in the non spiked serum samples.
To avoid further contaminations the PCR reagents were tested with PCR on contaminations by using different reagents and also the reagents of the extraction kit were tested. There was no contamination in these reagents.
Albumin PCR extractions 20/09 - 2 rounds
The exact same Albumin PCR steps were followed for the extractions of 20/09 as for the extractions of 10/09 that has positive bands for albumin after two rounds of PCR with the same primers. But, doing this with the samples of 20/09 did not give a positive result. No bands were visible.

d-AuNPs Generation
In order to generate dextrin-capped gold nanoparticles, first a gold chloride (HAuCl4.H2O) stock solution of 50 mL was prepared by dissolving 393.8 mg of HAuCl4.H2O in 50 mL of distilled sterile water. After preparation, this solution was stored at 4 °C covered in aluminium foil.
Secondly, a 10% sterile sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) solution was prepared by dissolving 4.985 g Na2CO3 in 50 mL MilliQ water, after which the solution was filter sterilized.
Then, 200 mL distilled sterile water was be adjusted to pH 9 by carefully adding 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) drops of 20 uL at a time, while keeping the solution sterile under a flame.
Subsequently, 25 mL of dextrin solution was prepared by dissolving 625 mg of dextrin powder in 25 mL of sterile MilliQ water to obtain a concentration of 25 g/L. This solution was then added to a sterile 250 mL flask.
Then, 5 mL of the gold chloride stock solution was added to the 250 mL flask and the pH was adjusted to 9 with the sterile 10% sodium carbonate solution, while working sterile.
Lastly, the reaction volume was completed to 50 mL by adding 20 mL distilled water (pH = 9).
For the actual generation of the d-AuNPs the flask was then incubated at 50 °C, covered in aluminium foil with continuous shaking for 3 to 8 hours. After 3 to 8 hours shaking, a reddish colour was observed on the solution that is characteristic for the correct size nanoparticle formation. The solution was observed every 30 minutes to check for red color formation.
Transmission Electron Microscope analysis was performed to check the size and size distribution of the d-AuNPs. the suspension of d-AuNPs in distilled water (ratio 1:4) and sonicate it for 5 min. Then, after plasma treatment this solution was be transferred to a copper grid for imaging. The correct size of the d-AuNPs be in the order of 10 nm.
We observed d-AuNPs in a relatively low concentrations. Also, the sizes varied unequally around 100 nm, which is an indication of aggregation as the expected sizes are around 10 nm. Therefore, a new batch had to be made for the actual analysis.

d-AuNPs Testing: d-AuNPs stability upon salt
The dAuNPs are tested for their stability under different salt concentrations. 20 µL of the d-AuNPs solution, 20 µL MilliQ and 20 µL NaCl solutions (range from 0 mM to 2000 mM) were added in one of the 96 wells on the 92 wells plate. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.
The aggregation of d-AuNPs occured at a final NaCl concentration of 1M*⅓ = 333 mM, but increased when adding more salt. At a final concentration of 2M*⅓=666 mM NaCl, the aggregates were the most intensively changed of color. One mistake was made by pipetting the complete d-AuNPs tube into the wells without mixing the tube constantly. The d-AuNPs were sedimentating to the bottom of the tube and this was pipetted into wells E1 and E2. These results should be left out of the data analysis.
From the data, the spectrum of the mixtures with 0 mM, 1000 mM and 2000 mM NaCl were plotted. Due to pipetting errors and mixing errors, the standard deviations at lower salt concentrations were high. Additionally, the from all the samples with different salt concentrations, the ratio 620/520 was calculated and plotted over the salt concentration.

d-AuNPs Generation
In order to generate dextrin-capped gold nanoparticles, first a gold chloride (HAuCl4.H2O) stock solution of 50 mL was prepared by dissolving 393.8 mg of HAuCl4.H2O in 50 mL of distilled sterile water. After preparation, this solution was stored at 4 °C covered in aluminium foil.
Secondly, a 10% sterile sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) solution was prepared by dissolving 4.985 g Na2CO3 in 50 mL MilliQ water, after which the solution was filter sterilized.
Then, 200 mL distilled sterile water was be adjusted to pH 9 by carefully adding 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) drops of 20 uL at a time, while keeping the solution sterile under a flame.
Subsequently, 25 mL of dextrin solution was prepared by dissolving 625 mg of dextrin powder in 25 mL of sterile MilliQ water to obtain a concentration of 25 g/L. This solution was then added to a sterile 250 mL flask.
Then, 5 mL of the gold chloride stock solution was added to the 250 mL flask and the pH was adjusted to 9 with the sterile 10% sodium carbonate solution, while working sterile.
Lastly, the reaction volume was completed to 50 mL by adding 20 mL distilled water (pH = 9).
For the actual generation of the d-AuNPs the flask was then incubated at 50 °C, covered in aluminium foil with continuous shaking for 3 to 8 hours. After 3 to 8 hours shaking, a reddish colour was observed on the solution that is characteristic for the correct size nanoparticle formation. The solution was observed every 30 minutes to check for red color formation.
Transmission Electron Microscope analysis was performed to check the size and size distribution of the d-AuNPs. the suspension of d-AuNPs in distilled water (ratio 1:4) and sonicate it for 5 min. Then, after plasma treatment this solution was be transferred to a copper grid for imaging. The correct size of the d-AuNPs be in the order of 10 nm.
We observed d-AuNPs in a relatively low concentration. The size distribution is ranging from 8 nm to 13 nm, which is sufficient for d-AuNPs analysis for prescreening.

d-AuNPs Testing: d-AuNPs stability upon salt

The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The plate view is shown.
The aggregation of d-AuNPs occured at a final NaCl concentration of 100 mM. In comparison with the old d-AuNPs batch, they aggregate at a lower salt concentration indicating that they are less stable. This observation can be explained by the time that the gold nanoparticles were in solution. During the generation, dextrin solution was added. The incubation time was approximately 8 hours and in this time the gold nanoparticles were capped by dextrin. The dextin makes the gold nanoparticles more stable. However, when the gold nanoparticles stay in the solution for a longer time, the remaining dextrin can adhere to the gold nanoparticles, making them more stable.

d-AuNPs Testing: ssDNAp interaction with EPO target DNA
The prescreening with d-AuNPs is tested with EPO DNA as target. Prior, the ssDNAp is heated up to let the ssDNAp anneal to EPO target DNA and create the secondary structure. The ssDNAp, EPO target DNA and hybridization buffer were incubated:
5 minutes at 95 ºC (denature dsDNA target)
1 minute at 57 ºC (anneal ssDNAp to dsDNA target)
10 minutes at 21 ºC
20 µL d-AuNPs, 10 µL target dsDNA, 6 µL hybridization buffer, 4 µL ssDNAp 1 and 20 µL of a varying salt concentration (range of 0 mM to 1000 mM) were added to the 96 wells plate. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.
The aggregation of d-AuNPs due to increasing salt concentration starts at 500 mM of NaCl. When a ssDNAp is added, the aggregation is extended to a NaCl concentration of 600 mM. However, presence of dsDNA target with a ssDNAp that can specifically bind to the target dsDNA does not influence the aggregation behavior drastically compared to the aggregation when dsDNA target is absent. Presence of only dsDNA target does decrease the stabilization of the d-AuNPs as they already aggregate at a NaCl added of 250 mM.

Again, the primer 051 was used as off-target ssDNAp. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.
In order to check the versatility of the prescreening, the effect of background DNA present in the sample, the d-AuNPs test is also performed with ssDNAp 3, 4 and 5 .

To test the effect of DMSO on the PCR performance, one extra tube per amplicon was made that was supplemented with 1.5 μL DMSO (3% final) and 34 μL MilliQ. Additionally, instead of the amplified Tn5 PCR product as template, the original pTXB1-Tn5 plasmid was used as template.  Finally, a negative control sample was taken into account that contained no primers and 37.5 μL MilliQ instead.
The thermocycler programme was installed to have an extension time of 1 min 30 seconds and an annealing temperature of 60 °C. In order to check the difference between two PCR machines (older one and new one), the tubes were divided over the two thermocyclers. After the programme was finished, samples were kept at 4 °C.

Also, the HF buffer supplemented with 3% DMSO resulted in the required amplicon. Remarkably, the old PCR machine did result in thicker and brighter bands DNA. This might be due to the differences in speed when changing temperature.

Colony PCR
Colony PCR was done to verify propagation of pACYC1Duet-1_Lin-Tn5 after transformation from 28-06-2018. This plasmid contains the Lin-Tn5 or Tn5-Lin insert, which can be checked with primers 029 and 030. There are two ways for colony PCR. The first one is picking a colony and directly resuspending the cells in PCR mixture. The second one is resuspending the colony in MilliQ, heating the suspension, centrifugation the broken cell pieces and taking the supernantant for PCR. In orde to test the efficiency of both methods, I tested both simultaneously. 22 colony PCR were performed by picking the colony and direct resuspension in the PCR mixture, while 20 colonies were picked and heated prior to pipetting the DNA into the PCR mixture.

In our laboratory, we experienced some trouble with restriction ligation cloning. Therefore, I aimed for checking the efficiency of all restriction enzymes used in the cloning process. I used the pACYCDuet-1 plasmid and restricted this plasmid with the restriction enzyme XbaI and one of the restriction enzymes EcoRI, KpnI, NotI or FseI. To compare, I restricted the pACYCDuet-1 plasmid only with XbaI and as negative control I used no restriction enzyme to cut pACYCDuet-1.

Sequence Verification
Sequence from plasmid
For verification of Tn5-lin insertion in pACYC, primers 003, 012, 029 and 030 were used for sequencing. The sequencing starts from the -20 bp position of fragment Tn5-lin, flanking the promoter of T7 and terminator from T7 of the vector. Sequencing sample was prepared in 1.5 mL tubes for each primer as indicated my Macrogen for specific concentration of plasmid DNA.
Primer sequences can be found at: Primer sequences .
Within 2 days, the sequence was retrievable online and alignment with the in silico designed molecule showed 100% match of the insert lin-Tn5, by aligning both primer sequences obtained.

The forward and reverse primers sets that were used are 001 & 002 and 005 & 006 and 007 & 008 respectively. Two times 3 times 50µL PCR mixtures were prepared, according to the High Fidelity PCR protocol . However, one of the sets of 3 times 50µL PCR mixtures uses HF buffer and Phusion Polymerase, while the other set of 3 times 50µL PCR mixtures uses Q5 buffer and Q5 Polymerase.

It is apparent that no amplicons of interest are found, other than template/uncut/self-closing plasmids (lane 3 & 25). Judging from the double bands around 200 and 500, most of the clones are identified to contain plain pACYC-DUET, which contains double T7 promoter, resulting in double amplicons around that height.

DNA Gel Electrophoresis
The PCR amplicons for construction of the BioBricks Tn5, T7p-Tn5-T7t and Linker into pSB13 were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 4 μL was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
The gel image shows that the pSB1C3 BioBrick backbone is succesfully amplified. However, when the extra nucleotide is incorporated for non coding sequence BioBrick construction, this resulted not in the desired amplicon. The Tn5 was correctly amplified as well as the T7p-Tn5-T7t expression cassette. The Linker sequence is not correctly amplified as there is no band seen at 143 bp.

The dxCas9 coding sequence contains forbidden restriction sites to be RFC compatible. Therefore, Gblocks were ordered at IDT. The dxCas9 is to large to order as one Gblock. Therefore I ordered two Gblocks, also incorporating Linker-Tn5 coding sequences (Gblock 1 and 2). To be able to construct also a different variant of the fusion protein, two Gblocks were ordered in the order Tn5-Linker-dxCas9 (Gblock 3 and 4).
To amplify the Gblocks 1 and 2 as well as the pACYCDuet-1 backbone, high fidelity PCR was done. The template DNA are the Gblocks 1 (primerset 045 & 046) and 2 (primerset 047 & 048) and pACYCDuet-1 (primerset 049 & 050).

Tn5:adapter DNA complex formation
Since this is the first time this experiment was done, the idea is to get the idea of the required amount of adapter needed in the reaction. Therefore 3 different adapter concentrations were added, namely 5µM, 25µM and 50µM. Tn5  was loaded with adapter DNA shown above by following the pipetting scheme shown on Table 2. All samples and reagents were kept on ice during preparation.

The samples were incubated at 55°C for 10 minutes and stopped by adding final 1% SDS. The integration products were analysed on 2% TAE agarose gel. The gel was stained with sybersafe and imaged with GelDoc system. The resulting gel is shown on figure 1.

Figure 1 suggested that the staining of the gel was poorly done as bands that was supposed to be present on the first and last lane were not visible. The smear on the rest of the lanes suggested the possible integration of adapter, creating bands of smaller sizes. However, more negative controls should be done to confirm this further.

From previous result, we learned that:
High amount of glycerol might be needed for integration since previous experiment without glycerol did not result in any integration.
Since finally Tn5 has to function together with dxCas9, we will try to do the reaction in lower temperature, since dxCas9 might be denatured at 55°C.Therefore, in this experiment, the adapter loading and integration experiment will be done in one go, at 37°C for 2 hours.
New adapter will be used, which has ME sequence on both sides to test whether this type of integration (integration without splitting the fragment into two) would work better.
The reaction was done following the pipetting scheme shown on Table 2. All samples and reagents were kept on ice during preparation.

Fusion protein functionality testing: Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay
From the previous test, it was shown that Tn5 by itself were able to load the adapter DNA. Since the Tn5 portion of the fusion protein might behave differently, we did the same experiment with the fusion protein.
The components of the reagents can be found on the protocol. The sequence of the adapter used in this assay is shown on table 1.

Fusion protein functionality testing: integration assay
Previous integration assay did not show any integration product on the gel. In this section, we will perform PCR amplication with primer sets that will specifically bind to integration product (primer will bind on the target DNA on one side, and to the adapter on the other side). Since this is the first time this type of experiment was carried out. Different variables were tested:
Two different reaction time were tested, namely 1 and 16 hours to see the effect of reaction duration on integration.
Some of the reaction were stopped with heat or SDS to release DNA from the protein. PCR clean up were carried out right after the integration to get rid of excess SDS before PCR.
For the rest of the reaction, PCR reaction was done directly after integration.
The PCR product was either directly run on the gel, or was first subjected to PCR clean up to get rid of small background DNA fragment before running it on the gel.
Second PCR was done to reamplify the first PCR product, in case very little product was visualised.
The components of the reagents can be found on the protocol. The sequence of the adapter used in this assay is shown on table 1.
Table 1: Primer sequence to be annealed for the adapter. Note that 5’ of the upper strand of the adapter has to be phosphorylated for successful integration.

The samples were incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes.
Target DNA (EPO cDNA) was added to make final concentration of ~5ng/µl.
The samples were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. 10µl of samples were taken to be analysed on 5% native TBE polyacrylamide gel (Figure 1). Based on Figure 1a, only uncleaved target DNA at 635bp and Donor DNA at 50pb are observed. No integration or high order complexes are visible. On Figure 1b, it showed that after 16h integration time, the target DNA disappears when Fusion protein is present, and significant smearing is observed, indicating functionality of the fusion protein. No specific cleavage bands nor big complex bands are observed.

25µl of samples were taken and deactivated by either only heat or heat + SDS. This was followed by PCR clean up.
To amplify the integration products, PCR was done, both to the cleaned up sample and to the original itegration product. PCR mix and cycle can be found on protocol.
The PCR products were analysed on 5% native TBE polyacrylamide gel. The resulting gels are shown on Figure 2.

Figure 2 shows 2 interesting PCR products observed (lane 2 and 3). Note the 2 PCR products are not observed in the negative controls (lane 4 and 5). No PCR products observed for lane 1-14 (when PCR clean up was done before PCR), most likely due to too little product, which got lost during PCR clean up.
A second PCR was done from the product of the first PCR to amplify the product further. The PCR product wan run on 5% TBE native PAGE shown on Figure 3.
A more intense band are shown after the second PCR cycle. More intense unspecific bands are shown more on the negative control

Fusion protein functionality testing: integration assay
From previous reaction, we saw that we were able to amplify some integration product, eventhough it was difficult to see whether or not it's specifically targetted. Therefore, we included more negative control in this reaction. Moreover, it was shown than performing PCR clean up prior to PCR leads no amplification of the integration product, perhaps due to the loss of products that might have been in very little amount during clean up process. Therefore, the following will be implemented in this reaction
The course of integration over time will be observed by stoping the integration reaction at 4 different time points, namely 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hour, and over night.
PCR clean up procedure will not be implemented prior or post PCR reaction.
Second round PCR will be not implemented.
More negative control will be implemented. This includes reaction without adapter (to see whether there will be integration), without EPO (to see whether there will still be amplification product), without sgRNA (to compare the supposedly targetted integration guided by sgRNA vs non targetted integration), reaction with Tn5 (to compare the supposedly targetted integration by our fusion protien vs random integration by Tn5)
The components of the reagents can be found on the protocol. The sequence of the adapter used in this assay is shown on table 1.

The samples were incubated at 37°C. At incubation time = 1h, 4h, 8h, and over night, 2.5 µl of sample were taken from each reaction and was subjected to PCR. PCR mix and cycle can be found on protocol.
The PCR products were analysed on 5% native TBE polyacrylamide gel. The resulting gel is either stained with ethidium bromide and imaged with GelDoc system, or directly imaged with Typhoon Imaging System. The resulting gels are shown on Figure 1.

Figure 1 showed the result of PCR. Hyphothetically, sgRNA would steer the fusion protein to the target EPO (~600bp), specifically to the area close to the 160th bp. When specific integration occurs, target EPO will be split into two fragments of around  280 and 480. PCR reactions were done with primer sets that would amplify these fragments seperately. Lane 2 shows the PCR of the first fragment. A very intense band were indeed present around 230bp, confirming the presence of this integration product. Lane 3 shows the PCR of second fragment. An intense band were also present around 480bp, which also confirmed the presence of the second integration product. On the negative control lanes (without sgRNA or with Tn5), random bands were present, and none of these intense bands shown on lane 2 and 3 were observed here . This confirmed further that targeted integration indeed occur due to our fusion protein that is loaded with sgRNA. The absence of amplification bands on the other negative controls confirmed our result further.
Results of the longer incubation time shows similar result. However, it seems like the specific bands loses intensity with increasing time, suggesting perhaps re-integration events done by excess fusion protein. The higher intensity of unspecific lower bands over time strengthen this analysis further. Figure 2,3 and 4 displays the result of PCR after 4, 8, and overnight incubation time

Fusion protein functionality testing: integration assay
From previous reaction, we saw that we were able to amplify the specific integration product that we expected, which, together with the results of the negative control, confirmed the ability of our fusion protein to perform specific integration. In this experiment, we would like to confirm this further by using a longer target DNA. If specific integration indeed occur, one of the new amplified fragment should also get longer by the same increase. Moreover, more sgRNA were tested to check whether other parts of the target EPO is also accessible. The following will therefore be done:
Incubation time of 1 hour will be implemented
3 different EPO fragments were used. The original EPO cDNA, longer EPO with "intron" on the third junction, longer EPO with "intron" on the fourth junction
4 different sgRNA was used, targeting junction 1-4
reaction without gRNA, and reaction with Tn5 will be done in parallel as negative controls
The components of the reagents can be found on the protocol. The sequence of the adapter used in this assay is shown on table 1.

EPO with intron on Junction 3 was targetted by sgRNA 2.1 to see the increase of the size of the second fragment in comparison to the previous successfull experiments.
EPO with intron on Junction 3 was targetted by J3.1 to see whether EPO can be targetted even though the target site is disrupted by an intron sequence.
EPO with intron on Junction 4 was targetted by J4.1 to see whether EPO can be targetted even though the target site is disrupted by an intron sequence.
As a negative control reaction without sgRNA with normal EPO or EPO with intron on junction 3 or 4 were carried out in parallel
The samples were incubated at 37°C. At incubation time = 30 mins, 2.5 µl of sample from reaction with normal EPO + sgRNA J2.1 were taken along with the necessary negative control reactions to see whether we can decrease off target even more by deacreasing reaction time. These samples were then subjected to PCR based on the protocol. At incubation time=1 hours, 2.5µl sample from each reaction were subjected to PCR. PCR mix and cycle can be found on protocol.
The PCR products were analysed on 5% native TBE polyacrylamide gel. The resulting gel is either stained with ethidium bromide and imaged with GelDoc system. The resulting gels for intergration with sgRNA J1.1 - J4.1 are shown on figure 1-4.

Figure 1 showed  uncleaved target DNA at 635bp and no integration fragments at 148bp and 548bp are observed (lane 2 and 3). Very little background is observed from ~150bp to ~50bp, probably due to off target events from the fusion protein.

Figure 2 Uncleaved target DNA at 635bp and 1247bp and 2 integration fragments at 280bp and 480/1068bp are observed (lane 1-7). Note the 2 PCR products are not observed in the negative controls (lane 9-12). Very little background is observed from ~150bp to ~50bp, probably due to off target events from the fusion protein. Note with the intron at junction 3, the integrated fragment is 1063, and the target DNA is 1247, causing the bands to un very close to each other.

Very little background is observed from ~150bp to ~50bp, probably due to off target events from the fusion protein. EPO_I3 in late 5 and 9 has an interesting amplification pattern.

Sequence Verification of Integration Products
In order to confirm that the integration products of the functionality test were the ones we expected, we attempted to sequence verify them. We load the whole PCR product visualized on lane 2 and 3 from functionality assay on 28/09/2018 on 2% agarose gel and isolated the bands from the gel and purify them. Since a very low concentration was achieved, another round of PCR was done using the isolated fragment as template. We cleaned up the PCR product and achieved concentration of 250ng/µl for fragment 1, and 50ng/µl for fragment 2.
We sent these PCR products individually for sequencing. The alignment result of this sequence is shown on Figure 1.
Sequence alignment of integration product (two red arrows) with the target EPO. Pink box represent the sgRNA binding site.
Figure 1 shows the sequence alignment between the two fragments and the target EPO gene.From the sequence alignment, we can confirm that integration occured upstream the sgRNA binding site. The overlapping alignment between the two products  suggested that integration does not always occur at the exact base pair position (~10bp variation), which might be the result of the flexible linker between dxCas9 and Tn5.
Next, we used pGEM T-Easy cloning method to clone these fragments on individual plasmid to be able to sequence verify them individually. By doing this we will be able to see the variations within that band individually. The protocol for pGEM T-Easy can be found on the protocol page. We used 2µl of 10x diluted sample of isolated fragment 1 or 1µl of isolated fragment 2 to be cloned into the plasmid. We were able to get white colonies and isolated their plasmid, but however, the sequence verification result did not come on time.

Colony PCR
Colony PCR was done to verify the success of EPO and sgRNA for LacZ biobrick. 3 different colonies from each plate were subjected to colony PCR. Two different primer sets were used. Biobrick primers 031 and 032 were used to verify the size of the insert. Primers 038 and 039 were used to verify the presence of EPO fragment within the biobrick backbone. Primers IV003 and IV004 were used to verify the presence of sgRNA for LacZ fragment within the biobrick backbone.
The PCR components and program can be found on the colony PCR protocol page. The PCR products were run on 2% TAE agarose gel shown on Figure 1. Upper lanes of Figure 1 shows amplification of insert with primers that anneal to the biobrick backbone flanking the insert (031 and 032). Lower lanes on Figure 1 shows amplification of insert with internal primers. All and all, the results confirmed insertion of the correct insert length.

Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the expression of the Tn5 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 12% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol. The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:

No Tn5 was observed in the lysate or the elution fraction. At first, we thought an error occurred during expression, however after thorough analysis we identified our mistake. There was a miss communication between stain construction and bioprocess as a result the plasmid was in the incorrect host organism. The Tn5 plasmid was still in DH5 alpha. Going forward, all transformation into expression host will be covered by the bioprocess team, to avoid this mistake in the future.

A significant amount of Tn5 was observed in the nickel chromatography elution fractions (lane 6-9), however the Tn5 protein was also observed in the flowthrough and wash fractions (lane 4,5). It is recommended to optimize the nickel chromatography to reduce these losses, however a bigger consern is a double band for Tn5 is observed. One at the expected weight, and one slightly higher. It was unclear why the Tn5 would run higher. As a following step, elution fraction 1 (lane 6) was run under different denaturing conditions to fully denature the protein.
Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the degradation of the Tn5 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 12% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt.

A double band for Tn5 observed for all conditions, both bands from the 12% gel were excised and sent for mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry confirmed that both bands were full length Tn5 with both the N and C terminal intact. This concluded that there was not any protease digestion and that the results are potentially due to a gel artifact. As a result, the purification will continue.

The heparin chromatography was successful. No losses were observed in the flowthrough or wash (ane 3-4) of the run, resulting in high recoveries. The first 4 elution fractions (lane 5-8) contained some low molecular weight contaminating proteins and therefore only elution fraction 6 to 11 (lane 10 to 15) were pooled.

The nickel chromatography was not completely successful, but improved significantly after an the concentration of imidazole in the binding buffer was reduced to 5mM. The dxCas9 did not completely bind to the nickel resin and was observed in the flowthrough and wash (lane 6-8). It is recommended to further optimize the nickel chromatography to further reduce losses, and reduce contaminating proteins due to non-specific binding to the nickel resin (lane 9-10). However for our purposes, the losses were tolerated, and only elution fractions 3 to 6 were pooled (lane 11-14). Additionally, a double band for dxCas9 is observed. The purification will be continued however, we will look deeper into this observation. Is this double band due to degradation, or some other interaction with the dxcas9? We are working with technicians on performing mass spectrometry.

On the 6% tris-glycine SDS PAGE a single band for dxCas9 was observed for all conditions, suggesting that the double band might be some artifact of the 12% SDS PAGE. To further confirm these results, both bands from the 12% gel were excised and sent for mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry confirmed that both bands were full length dxCas9 with both the N and C terminal intact. This concluded that there was not any protease digestion and that the results are potentially due to a gel artifact. As a result, the purification will continue.

Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the expression of the fusion protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 12% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol. The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:
Figure Fusion Expression: 12% SDS PAGE of fusion (expected size 214.7kDa). Lane 1 molecular ladder (kDa), lane 2 whole lysate, lane 3 cell debris, lane 5 clarified lysate.
Protein Purification - Heparin Chromatography
The fusion protein was further purified with Heparin chromatography. The 1mL HiTrap Heparin HP column was connected to the AKTA pure in the cold room at 4 ℃. 42.4mL of crude lysate from fusion protein was injected into the injection loop and the chromatography was followed according to the Purification Protocol.
Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the heparin chromatography of the fusion protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 8% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:
Figure Heparin Chromatography. 8% SDS PAGE of fusion (expected size 214.7kDa). Lane 1 molecular ladder (kDa), lane 2 elution 1, lane 3 elution 2, lane 4 elution 3, lane 5 elution 4, lane 6 elution 5, lane 7 elution 6, lane 8 elution 7, lane 9 elution 8, lane 10 elution 9, lane 11 elution 10, lane 12 elution 11, lane 13 elution 12.
Degradation was suspected for our fusion protein. Results seem to suggest that the fusion protein is being cleaved at the linker, resulting in both the dxCas9 and the fusion protein being present in our sample. The heparin chromatography was relatively successful at separating the two populations. The dxCas9 has a lower affinity to the heparin resin as a result it elutes at lower concentrations of salt (lane 2-10). As the concentration of salt increases less dxCas9 and more fusion elutes (lane 6-10). At high levels of salt the mostly fusion elutes (lane 11-13). Only these last three elution fractions are pooled (lane 11-13). Thus losses are tolerated, to obtain a relatively pure fusion fraction which can be further purified by MonoQ.

Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse monoQ of the fusion protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 8% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol. The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:

Finally the fusion protein is dialysed and concentrated. 4.5mL of sample (MonoQ chromatography elution fraction 2-10 of fusion protein) were dialysed according to the purification protocol with dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 1mM beta-Mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5).
Protein Purification - Concentration
After dialysis, 4.5mL of sample of fusion protein was concentrated to a final volume of 0.6mL and  stored at -20℃, according to the purification protocol.
In order to analyse the concentrated fusion protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 8% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol. The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:

Protein Purification - Heparin Chromatography
The fusion protein was further purified with Heparin chromatography. The 1mL HiTrap Heparin HP column was connected to the AKTA pure in the cold room at 4 ℃. 45.2mL of crude lysate from fusion protein was injected into the injection loop and the chromatography was followed according to the Purification Protocol.

8-15
Degradation of our fusion protein is still significant. Results seem to suggest that the fusion protein is being cleaved at the linker, resulting in both the dxCas9 and the fusion protein being present in our sample. The heparin chromatography was relatively successful at separating the two populations. The dxCas9 has a lower affinity to the heparin resin as a result it elutes at lower concentrations of salt. As the concentration of salt increases less dxCas9 and more fusion elutes (gel1, lane 9-15 and gel2, lane 1-7). At high levels of salt the mostly fusion elutes (gel2, lane 8-15). Only these last eight elution fractions are pooled. Thus losses are tolerated, to obtain a relatively pure fusion fraction which can be further purified by MonoQ.

Protein Purification - Dialysis
Finally the fusion protein is dialysed and concentrated. 4.5mL of sample (MonoQ chromatography elution fraction 2-10 of fusion protein) were dialysed according to the purification protocol with dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 1mM beta-Mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5).
Protein Purification - Concentration
After dialysis, 4.5mL of sample of fusion protein was concentrated to a final volume of 0.6mL and  stored at -20℃, according to the purification protocol. Trace amounts of contaminating background was observed, however, the fusion was significantly more in quantity and the background was tolerated for functionality testing. The final concentration of the solution was determined according to the BCA protocol and resulted in a concentration of 0.56mg/mL.
