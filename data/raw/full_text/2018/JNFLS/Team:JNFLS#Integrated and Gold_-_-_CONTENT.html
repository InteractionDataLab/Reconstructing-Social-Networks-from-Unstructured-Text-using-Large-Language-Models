&lt;p&gt; In order to deeply understand how the blood being processed from the donors to the hospitals, our team visited the Blood Center of Shandong province. We visited around the building and laboratories. The labs there use negative pressure to keep the environment safe and clean. And some detections can achieve automation, which can prevent some man-made operation. Therefore, some pollution possibility can be reduced. The automated equipment is very convenient, not only can save much more time, but also keep the tests into a sterile environment. So，the tests can be more accurate. All the processes of testing are traceable. Each blood sample has a barcode, which can correspond to the donor, the data of each step must be recorded, and stored in the computer system. This makes the blood use traceable for the source of problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=" https:=""><UL><P> After the visit, our team members had an interview with the expert of the blood center. We also understand the detections taken in the blood center, and some detections are performed two times. The five main detections are as follows: </P><LI>Markers of HIV, including HIV antibody and nucleic acid.</LI><LI>Markers of HBV, including HBV antigen and nucleic acid.</LI><LI>Markers of HCV, including HCV antibody and nucleic acid.</LI><LI>Markers of Treponema pallidum, including antibody and nucleic acid</LI><LI>ALT detection</LI></UL><P> From the interview with the expert, we also know that: ① Not all the people would like to donate blood, and the blood bank is frequently in a shortage of blood supply. Today’s blood donation is facing a serious situation. ② HCV infected blood in window period have not been detected using nucleic acid method for HCV antibody detection negative samples for 4 years all over the Shandong province, although the window period is short viewed from nucleic acid level detection. However, the detection efficiency of HIV is 0.3 ‰ in the same condition. It means that there is a high possibility that some HCV infected blood in window period was delivered to the hospitals. It is very dangerous.</P><P> Combine with the interview and the questionnaire results, we focused these two things: ① We disseminated the blood donation knowledge since the public’s perception of blood donation is biased. We visited the government officials to know some policy and persuaded them to make a good policy for unpaid blood donation. It is that organizing unpaid donation blood is a required condition for evaluating advanced organization. ② Our project was decided to develop a biosensor for detecting HCV by nucleic acid aptamer, and the specific detection of trace HCV could be realized by rolling circle amplification, which has great significance to shorten the window period of HCV in clinic transfusion.</P><P> So, we distributed many leaflets (pictures showed as follow) to publicize the knowledge of blood donation and encourage more citizens (including team members’ parents) to join in the blood donation. We held a small lecture just beside the blood donation bus. The lecture was about the advantages of blood donation, and some preferential policies that made by the government to reward the blood donors. These activities were successful, there were many people came and donated their blood (shows as follows), and they said they would share these knowledges to their families and friends. We solved the blood supply shortage to some extent.</P><P> (the leaflets and we are publicizing the blood donation knowledge)</P><P> (Many people came and donated their blood after our propagation.)</P><P> (Team members’ parents are donating blood to support us.)</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
