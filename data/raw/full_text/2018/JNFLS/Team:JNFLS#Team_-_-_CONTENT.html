We’ve spent a whole summer together, and we‘ve all made a great contribution. This summer is really special to every iGEMer in JNFLS.</P><DIV class="center"><H4>Han Chang</H4></DIV><P>“I am an 11th-grade student at Jinan Foreign Language School, currently taking AP Chemistry and Biology courses. I am very eager to explore the mechanism of everything and using the knowledge to change the world. ‘Biology is the language of gods’, I often say so, ‘if we can utilize this language, the power of gods, our world can be unimaginably amazing.’ Holding this belief, I entered the gate of synthetic biology, and participated iGEM.”</P><P>He is the core of our team. As a leader, he needs to organize everything. He did the presentation about the result part, which is the trickiest one. He also did a lot of experiments. Meanwhile, he made the wiki of the experiments and results. He also took part in the human practice activities in the summer holiday.
</P><DIV class="center"><H4>Wang Sayuan</H4></DIV><P>“I’m a cat person, I like everything about cats, of course, I have a cat too. Ed Sheeran is my favorite singer. I am also a huge fan of different cartoons. My interests in biology started at a hospital, I saw people get better after the treatments, also saw some hopeless patients used almost all kinds of drugs but could never get any better. At that moment, I finally understand the special meaning of biology — maybe I can use it to help others. Now I am trying, learning and hoping. I wish I can do something for medicine in the near future.”</P><P>She took responsibilities in the presentation of the background part, she also wrote the attribution and the information of team member（basically is the one you are reading right now）part on the wiki. And she also did lots of experiments during the holiday.
</P><DIV class="center"><H4>Mu Yuyang</H4></DIV><P>“I’m from Dongying, Shandong. It’s really hard for me to do the experiment at Jinan with my teammates. I love to play bass guitar and I can play basketball very well. In my leisure time, I usually play video games with my friends. I’m also a big fan of movies especially DC ‘s movie, they really fantast me. ”</P><P>He edited our wiki and did a lot of experiments in the holiday, he took responsibilities in the modeling of our project with Qi Yunli, and also took part in the human practice activities to educate the public.
</P><DIV class="center"><H4>Liu Han</H4></DIV><P>“I am sooooooooooooooooooooooo happy !!!!!!!!!!!!!Because I am a gummy bear!!!!!!!!!GUMMY BEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”</P><P>He is in charge of the experiment part of the presentation and the experiment description part in the wiki. He also extracted several plasmids for the experiment. and took part in the human practice activities in order to let more and more people know about our project.

</P><DIV class="center"><H4>Zhang Luojia</H4></DIV><P>“Hi, I’m Luojia Zhang from Jinan Foreign Language School. Having great passion in mathematics and physics but finally falling into the abyss of biochemistry. It is such an enjoyable thing for me to stay in the lab for the whole day. iGEM provides me with a perfect opportunity! Out of school, I’m a big fan of sports, which in turn cultivates my perseverance in academic fields, pushing me to constantly improve operations until I find out an answer.”</P><P>She did a lot of experiments during the summer holiday, like PCR, and she did it very well. Also, she is in charge of the collaboration with OUC_China, and wrote the collaboration page on the wiki. Meanwhile, she took part in the human practice activities in the summer.
</P><DIV class="center"><H4>Qi Yunli</H4></DIV><P>“  My name is Leo. I am a very outgoing person. Biochemistry is one of my favorite subjects.

The world’s biggest problems mostly link with a biological and biomedical topic, arising the deep passion and curiosity within my soul. I truly appreciate the key that iGEM gives to me to open the gate of the biosynthetic experiment.”</P><P>She wrote the safety part on the wiki, and she also took part in the experiments and blood donation activities in the summer.
