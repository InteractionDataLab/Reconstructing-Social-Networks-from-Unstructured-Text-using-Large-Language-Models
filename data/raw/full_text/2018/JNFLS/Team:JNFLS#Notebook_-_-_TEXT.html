Week6 (6.4-6.10)
After connecting the cleavage products, we have sent them to the company for sequencing.
We started building two parts using PCR technique and digestion technique:
According to our design, We should know the sensitivity of the tetr repressible promoter. So we decided to build two plasmids.
Week7 (6.11-6.17)
successfully constructed and cryopreserved.
Continuing to build part: 1A and 1B.
We went to Hebei to have teaching activities for a week to spread IGEM to children in countryside.
Preparing of experimental materials.
Week8 (6.18-6.24)
Learning cell culture techniques, and beginning to culture of 293T cells.
According to our topic, we designed a series of questionnaires.
We began to construct the first plasmid vector:
Week9 (6.25-7.1)
It was verified by sequencing that we have building parts 1A and 1B successfully.
Through a small range of issuing questionnaires, we have further modified our questionnaires.
Continuing to construct the first plasmid vector, and preparing the materials for the second plasmid vectors.
Week10 (7.2-7.8)
We went to Qi Lu Hospital to have a meeting with the doctors who specialized in colon cancer cuing.
Extracting of luciferase and began to monitoring data.
We started building two parts using PCR technique and digestion technique
The construction of plasmid vector was started.
We started issuing questionnaires in a wide range.
Week11 (7.9-7.15)
Continuing to Construct the plasmid vector.
Preparing for the work of interlab.
It was verified by sequencing that we have constructed the first vector successfully. And we began to constructed the second vector: ROO40+E0840.
Week12 (7.16-7.22)
Continuing to build part: 1C,1Dand 1E.
Continuing to Construct the plasmid vector.
For the interlab, we have carried out preliminary experiments to be familiar with the use of instruments.
Continuing to construct the first plasmid vector.
Week13 (7.23-7.29)
Extracting of luciferase and beginning to monitor data.
It was verified by sequencing that we have building parts 1C,1D and 1E successfully.
We have done the work of interlab.
to some of the tubes with the same initial fluorescence intensity and measured the change in its fluorescence intensity.Week14 (7.30-8.5)
We have interview clinicians to know more about cancer and make some adjustments on our experimental ideas.
The plasmid vector was finally constructed successfully after hard working, and we decided to transfect the plasmid into the cells.
It was verified by sequencing that we have constructed the secong vector successfully.
Week15 (8.6-8.12)
We have went to Qingdao to communication thoughts with the students of Chinese Marine University.
We have made a series of posters.
After data processing, we got the curve which showed the influence of the tetracycline on the fluorescence intensity of TetR fusion protein.
Week16 (8.13-8.19)
Continuing to build part: 1F and 1G.
Learning cell transfection technology.
Public propaganda of science in the Technology Museum.
We transformed these two plasmids to competent cells, and according to their different resistances, we selected the strain of interest.
Week17 (8.20-8.26)
It was verified by sequencing that we have building parts 1F and 1G successfully.
We have participated the CCIC and acquired much valuable experience.
We went to science museum to spread the idea of iGEM and hand out questionnaires.
Week18 (8.27-9.2)
We take part in the CCiC in Fuzhou and acquired valuable advice.
Extraction of luciferase and began to monitoring data.
We started building two parts using PCR technique
Extracting the genomic DNA from cells,  and starting exploring the best conditions of PCR.
We added a series of tetracycline to combined with TetR in order to relieve the inhibition of TetR on TetR repressible promoter.
Week19 (9.3-9.9)
We have launched a series of activities to promote the IGEM competition for Freshmen.
A presentation for the students in our own school
Week20 (9.10-9.16)
Completing the data determination of cell NHFB.
Continuing to build part: 1H and 2A.
The PCR products were identified by restriction enzyme digestion. Unluckily, we didn't get the expected results. After analyzing the whole process, we have changed some conditions and decided to do it again.
