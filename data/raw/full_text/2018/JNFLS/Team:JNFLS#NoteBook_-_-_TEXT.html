Week 1(4.9-4.15)
Recruitment of team members and first meeting.
Brainstorming and learning about relevant materials.
We started to discuss our ideas and invited teachers to give some advice about our projects.
Presentation within the team to share what we learn about synthetic biology.
Week2(4.23-4.29)
Finally, we choose the idea of creating a new detection method for HCV in donated blood.
A lab was provided by Shandong University in summer vacation.
After many discussions, everyone's division of labor is becoming clearer.
We began to use our spare time to study experimental techniques.
we started to brainstorm in order to create our team logo.
Week3 (5.13-5.20)
We had a safety education before we started the formal experiment, including lab safety, researcher safety and environment safety. And we learned some emergency responses, such as how to use extinguisher and fire blanket, and how to use emergency shower and eye wash.
Made a concrete plan for our project.
Week4 (5.21-5.27)
Preparing the pCMV-CE1E2 plasmid
Learning bacteria culture techniques, and beginning to culture E.Coli
We ordered primers for the PCR of HCVC gene extraction from Biomics
Week5 (5.28-6.3)
We received the primers
The PCR to extract HCVC gene from pCMV-CE1E2
HCVC gene was obtained from PCR, and we sent it to the company for sequencing
We chose and ordered pColdII plasmids from the company
We ordered endonuclease KpnI and PstI from the company
Week6 (6.4-6.10)
We received pColdII plasmids
Digestion of pColdII with KpnI and PstI
Digestion of HCVC gene with KpnI and PstI
Ligation of the plasmid and HCVC gene
Week7 (6.11-6.17)
Transformation of the plasmid containing HCVC gene, monoclonal selection, and culturing transformed E.Coli
Positive colony PCR, and positive clone selection
We went to local schools to have teaching activities for a week to spread IGEM and biology to children
Preparing of experimental materials.
Week8 (6.18-6.24)
SDS-PAGE for HCVC protein gained in the first batch
According to our topic, we designed a series of questionnaires.
Week9 (6.25-7.1)
After browsing references, we decided to truncate the HCVC gene into HCVC120 and HCVC173
Through a small range of issuing questionnaires, we have further modified our questionnaires.
We ordered primers for truncation
Week10 (7.2-7.8)
We received the primers
We went to Blood Center of Shandong to have a meeting with the researchers who are familiar with pathogen detection in blood samples
Truncating HCVC gene using PCR technology
Sending HCVC120 and HCVC173 to the company for sequencing
We started issuing questionnaires in a wide range.
Week11 (7.9-7.15)
Ligating HCVC120 and HCVC173 into vector plasmid pColdII.
Preparing for the work of InterLab.
We went to the local blood donation bus to make propaganda of our project and blood donation, and helped the doctors with blood donation
Transforming the plasmid into E.Coli and perform positive colony PCR
SDS-PAGE of the extracted protein expressed from HCVC120 and HCVC173
We decided to optimize the sequence of HCVC120 and HCVC173
Week12 (7.16-7.22)
Optimizing the sequence of HCVC120 and HCVC173
Continuing to Construct the plasmid vector.
For the InterLab, we have carried out preliminary experiments to be familiar with the use of instruments.
We went to the local book store to hand out our questionnaires and get the public informed of our project and synthetic biology
We obtained optimized sequence HCVCO120 and HCVCO173
Week13 (7.23-7.29)
We ligated HCVCO120 and HCVCO173 into the pColdII plasmid
We have done the work of InterLab
Transforming the plasmid into E.Coli, inducing expression, and collecting purified protein
Week14 (7.30-8.5)
SDS-PAGE of purified protein HCVCO120 and HCVCO173
We used 293T cell to further purify the protein
Learning cell culturing and transfection technology.
We have interview clinicians to know more about HCV and make some adjustments on our experimental ideas.
Week15 (8.6-8.12)
SDS-PAGE of purified protein(from 293T)
The HCVC protein was finally purified successfully after hard working; we have adequate amount of antigen to perform further experiment now
We have made our poster.
Week16 (8.13-8.19)
We ordered aptamers, padlock probes, and cDNAs needed in our system
Public propaganda of knowledge about blood donation in other local blood donation buses with the team membersâ€™ parents
Week17 (8.20-8.26)
We received the synthesized DNAs.
We participated in the CCiC and acquired much valuable experience.
Week18 (8.27-9.2)
We took part in the CCiC in Shanghai and acquired valuable advice.
We started to perform the experiments to validify the operability of our detection system, using the DNAs and HCVC proteins
Extracting the genomic DNA from cells, and starting exploring the best conditions of PCR.
It was validified that our detection system is operable.
Week19 (9.3-9.9)
We have launched a series of activities to promote the IGEM competition for Freshmen.
A presentation for the students in our own school
Week20 (9.10-9.16)
