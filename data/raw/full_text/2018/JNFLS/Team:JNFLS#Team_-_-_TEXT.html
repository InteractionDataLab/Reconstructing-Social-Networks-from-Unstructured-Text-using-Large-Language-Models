Our team consists of 12 extraordinary teenagers and an instructor from Jinan Foreign Language School, also a knowledgeable professor from Shandong University. We’ve spent a whole summer together, and we‘ve all made a great contribution. This summer is really special to every iGEMer in JNFLS.
Han Chang
“I am an 11th-grade student at Jinan Foreign Language School, currently taking AP Chemistry and Biology courses. I am very eager to explore the mechanism of everything and using the knowledge to change the world. ‘Biology is the language of gods’, I often say so, ‘if we can utilize this language, the power of gods, our world can be unimaginably amazing.’ Holding this belief, I entered the gate of synthetic biology, and participated iGEM.”
He is the core of our team. As a leader, he needs to organize everything. He did the presentation about the result part, which is the trickiest one. He also did a lot of experiments. Meanwhile, he made the wiki of the experiments and results. He also took part in the human practice activities in the summer holiday.
Wang Sayuan
“I’m a cat person, I like everything about cats, of course, I have a cat too. Ed Sheeran is my favorite singer. I am also a huge fan of different cartoons. My interests in biology started at a hospital, I saw people get better after the treatments, also saw some hopeless patients used almost all kinds of drugs but could never get any better. At that moment, I finally understand the special meaning of biology — maybe I can use it to help others. Now I am trying, learning and hoping. I wish I can do something for medicine in the near future.”
She took responsibilities in the presentation of the background part, she also wrote the attribution and the information of team member（basically is the one you are reading right now）part on the wiki. And she also did lots of experiments during the holiday.
Mu Yuyang
“I’m from Dongying, Shandong. It’s really hard for me to do the experiment at Jinan with my teammates. I love to play bass guitar and I can play basketball very well. In my leisure time, I usually play video games with my friends. I’m also a big fan of movies especially DC ‘s movie, they really fantast me. ”
He edited our wiki and did a lot of experiments in the holiday, he took responsibilities in the modeling of our project with Qi Yunli, and also took part in the human practice activities to educate the public.
Liu Han
“I am sooooooooooooooooooooooo happy !!!!!!!!!!!!!Because I am a gummy bear!!!!!!!!!GUMMY BEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”
He is in charge of the experiment part of the presentation and the experiment description part in the wiki. He also extracted several plasmids for the experiment. and took part in the human practice activities in order to let more and more people know about our project.
Peng Yuchangxin
“Cemory. Girl. Theist. Simple. Marginalized. Spiritual Seeker. History. Biology. Classical literature. Traditional Chinese art. Forget. Waiting. Staring blankly. Me.”
She is responsible for all of the artwork in our project, including the design of the poster, logo,  and the clothes for our team. She also did the volunteer activities in blood station to encourage more and more people to donate their blood. She also made the home page on the wiki. She is a designer in our team.
Zhang Luojia
“Hi, I’m Luojia Zhang from Jinan Foreign Language School. Having great passion in mathematics and physics but finally falling into the abyss of biochemistry. It is such an enjoyable thing for me to stay in the lab for the whole day. iGEM provides me with a perfect opportunity! Out of school, I’m a big fan of sports, which in turn cultivates my perseverance in academic fields, pushing me to constantly improve operations until I find out an answer.”
She did a lot of experiments during the summer holiday, like PCR, and she did it very well. Also, she is in charge of the collaboration with OUC_China, and wrote the collaboration page on the wiki. Meanwhile, she took part in the human practice activities in the summer.
Qi Yunli
“  My name is Leo. I am a very outgoing person. Biochemistry is one of my favorite subjects. The intention that I want to attend this competition is that it is I want to enlarge my knowledge to have a better understanding of the biology.”
He is responsible for the construction of the model for our experiment, he also in charge of the collaboration with Peking University and did a lot of experiments in the holiday.
Xin Yuerong
“Hi, my name is Xin Yuerong, from JNFLS, and I’m in grade 11 this year. I don’t want to mention those normal hobbies. But I’m really crazy about documentaries. Because of them, I started to learn about the whole nature, and lead me to the biology. I’m very glad to be a member of JNFLS and one of the iGEMers in the world. We all made an effort and spent a lot of happy time. Thanks to all of you.”
She did the presentation of human practice part, also organized the human practice activities in the summer. And she did a lot of experiments in the summer and made wiki of the human practice part.
Liu Tiange
“My name is Tiange Liu, a student from JNFLS. Years ago, I found myself fall in love with this splendid science ---- biology. It is biology that teaches me the laws of nature; it is biology that leads me to investigate the essence of life; it is biology that allows me to explore the mysteries hidden inside our bodies. The world’s biggest problems mostly link with a biological and biomedical topic, arising the deep passion and curiosity within my soul. I truly appreciate the key that iGEM gives to me to open the gate of the biosynthetic experiment.”
She wrote the safety part on the wiki, and she also took part in the experiments and blood donation activities in the summer.
Cai Jianing
“My name is Cai Jianing. For now, I studied in JNFLIC, Grade 11, class 21. I found myself interested in biology since I was a little girl, and the interest came from my father; he always told me some interesting phenomenon in nature, and he took me to the zoo, went for hiking together, and visited the countryside with me when I was young. I built a strong bond between me and nature since then and that has become the reason why I love animals and biology so much nowadays.”
She did the experiments in the summer, and she also took part in the human practice activities in the blood station.
Zhu Xiaochi
“Simon Zhu, a fat otaku, favorite animations are Sword Art Online and Eromangasense, favorite game is League of Legends.”
His main job is to make the wiki, he wrote codes for our wiki with Mu Yuyang. He also took part in the human practice activities in the summer.
Qin Zelong
"My name is Merlin Queen, I have a lot of passion on the biology, and want to do something related to it. I am a sports lover, in that case, I wanna put my effort on sports nutrition one day. I also like do some charity work and write some stories."
He mainly did the experiments in the holiday, he also took part in the blood donation activities in the blood station of Shandong Province.
