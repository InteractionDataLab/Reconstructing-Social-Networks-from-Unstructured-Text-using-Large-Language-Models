Education and Public Engagement
Using the club recruiting chance in our school, we advertised our project to the students who are interested in biology and nature science. We introduced synthetic biology to them about  the concept, the significance and the future of synthetic biology with the E.coli cartoon designed by OUC-China, giving them a better perspective about the charm of synthetic biology. They learnt more about the blood donation and our project. Another purpose of this activity was to discover the potential members who want to take part in iGEM next year.
We also taught some students the simple biological technology, and held a competition of drawing picture on the agar plate, which caused a great repercussions. Many of them are very interested and wanted to join our team next year.
Here we would like to show some pictures as following that the students drew in the compitition of agar plate drawing. They are very fantastic，hope you like them and enjoy!
Public Engagement
During the club recruiting in our school, we advertised our project to the students who are interest in biology and nature science. We told them about the knowledge of synthetic biology, like what is synthetic biology, what is the significance of synthetic biology and the future of it. We hope that students can not only learn more about the blood donation, but also learn more about the meaning of this subject. Another aim was to discover the potential members who want to take part in iGEM next year.
We also hold a small lecture at our school. We first introduced our project to them, why we chose our topic, how we did the experiments and what we have found in the end. But the most important part of the educational lecture was to introduce the advantages of blood donation to our students and teachers. Because we need to set up the concept of blood donation in the early age. We made some flyers about the knowledge of blood donation and gave them out. The lecture was successful, and students also told their parents about the knowledge.
We hope that through our project and education, more and more people will change their opinions about blood donation. Maybe just one more person join in this, we can save one more life……
