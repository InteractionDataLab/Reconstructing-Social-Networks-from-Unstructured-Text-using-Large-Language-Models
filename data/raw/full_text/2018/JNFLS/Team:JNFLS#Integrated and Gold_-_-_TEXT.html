After the visit, our team members had an interview with the expert of the blood center. We also understand the detections taken in the blood center, and some detections are performed two times. The five main detections are as follows:
Markers of HIV, including HIV antibody and nucleic acid.
Markers of HBV, including HBV antigen and nucleic acid.
Markers of HCV, including HCV antibody and nucleic acid.
Markers of Treponema pallidum, including antibody and nucleic acid
ALT detection
From the interview with the expert, we also know that: ① Not all the people would like to donate blood, and the blood bank is frequently in a shortage of blood supply. Today’s blood donation is facing a serious situation. ② HCV infected blood in window period have not been detected using nucleic acid method for HCV antibody detection negative samples for 4 years all over the Shandong province, although the window period is short viewed from nucleic acid level detection. However, the detection efficiency of HIV is 0.3 ‰ in the same condition. It means that there is a high possibility that some HCV infected blood in window period was delivered to the hospitals. It is very dangerous.
Combine with the interview and the questionnaire results, we focused these two things: ① We disseminated the blood donation knowledge since the public’s perception of blood donation is biased. We visited the government officials to know some policy and persuaded them to make a good policy for unpaid blood donation. It is that organizing unpaid donation blood is a required condition for evaluating advanced organization. ② Our project was decided to develop a biosensor for detecting HCV by nucleic acid aptamer, and the specific detection of trace HCV could be realized by rolling circle amplification, which has great significance to shorten the window period of HCV in clinic transfusion.
So, we distributed many leaflets (pictures showed as follow) to publicize the knowledge of blood donation and encourage more citizens (including team members’ parents) to join in the blood donation. We held a small lecture just beside the blood donation bus. The lecture was about the advantages of blood donation, and some preferential policies that made by the government to reward the blood donors. These activities were successful, there were many people came and donated their blood (shows as follows), and they said they would share these knowledges to their families and friends. We solved the blood supply shortage to some extent.
