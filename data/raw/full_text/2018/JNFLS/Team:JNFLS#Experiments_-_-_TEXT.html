Ligation
Perform agarose gel/ethidium bromide electrophoresis to fractionate DNA fragments. Any type or grade of agarose may be used. However, it is strongly recommended that fresh TAE buffer or TBE buffer be used as running buffer. Do not reuse running buffer as its pH will increase and reduce yields.
When adequate separation of bands has occurred, carefully excise the DNA fragment of interest using a wide, clean, sharp scalpel. Minimize the size of the gel slice by removing extra agarose.
Determine the appropriate volume of the gel slice by weighing it in a clean 15 mL microcentrifuge tube. Assuming a density of 1 g/mL, the volume of gel is derived as follows: a gel slice of mass 0.3 g will have a volume of 0.3 mL

Isolate a single colony from a freshly streaked selective plate, and inoculate a culture of 1- 5 mLLB medium containing the appropriate selective antibiotic. lnocubate for~12-16hours at 37C with vigorous shaking (~ 300 rpm). Use a 10-20 mL culture tube or a flask with a volume of at least 4 times the volume of the culture. It is strongly recommended that an endA negative strain of E. coli be used for routine plasmid isolation. Examples of such strains include DH5a* and JM1O9.
Centrifuge at 10,000x g for 1 minute at room temperature.
Decant or aspirate and discard the culture media.

SDS-PAGE of Induced expression:
Stage 2
At present, the problem is that the previously purified antigens are so weak (in the supernatant liquid) that more relevant experiments cannot be carried out in the hope of improving the prokaryotic expression system to obtain relevant proteins. As a result, more downstream experiments can be carried out, and there is currently no way to buy ready HCV core proteins from companies to speed up our experiments.
The final lane may have few target proteins for downstream experiments. Our current strategy is to change the form of fusion proteins as shown below.
The gene is planned to be inserted into the following plasmid vector; its fusion protein label is MBP. Meanwhile, His tag is moved further from core protein gene, because the isoelectric point of core protein is too high. It is hoped that the current difficult situation can be changed.

#1  Examination of the reaction of designed primer, probe, and cDNA
2.5 µL 10 µM Aptamer Circle Probe, 2.5 µL 0.1 µM cDNA, 1uL 10×annealing buffer, 4µL  ddH2O to the 10 uL reaction system，anneal at 95 °C for 10 min, then let it cool naturally. cDNA and aptamer are not added in the negative control group. Aptamer is added in the inhibition group to form competitive and complementary binding.
2.5ul annealed product (2.5uM final concentration) is taken; 1ul Reaction Buffer, 1ul 10 x T4 DNA ligase, and ddH2O 5.5ul are added in the product; the reaction is run at 22 ° C for 2 hours.
5ul product of the ligase reaction in Step 2 is taken; 10×phi29 DNA polymerase Reaction Buffer 2 ul, phi29 DNA polymerase 1 ul, BSA 0.5ul, 2.5mM dNTP 1ul, and ddH2O 10.5 ul are added; the reaction is run at 37°C for 2 hours.
Take 4 ul reacted mixture，run 1%AGE，and observe whether rolling circle amplification products exist.
Continue the reaction for 16 hours(overnight), take 4ul reacted mixture again, run 1%AGE, and observe the impact of reacting time on the reaction.
Two parallel reactions were performed, respectively with different batches of enzymes. The 8 samples on the left and the 8 samples on the right showed consistency, and the parallel lines were good, but the amplification total products were different due to the different activity of the two batches of enzymes, but the amplification trend was consistent.
TB aptamer and the establishment of its competitive reaction system
A large number of rolling ring amplification products, such as reaction 1 and 2, can be obtained by the hybridization of TB padlock probes with both types of cDNA. The rolling circle amplification products cannot be produced in the reaction system without adding cDNA, such as the reaction 4. When an equal proportion of aptamer DNA is added to the reaction system to compete for the hybridization of cDNA, because the padlock probe cannot hybridize with enough cDNA and connect to cyclize, it cannot generate a clear rolling circle amplification product; such as reaction 3.
HCV aptamer padlock probe and its ligation and rolling circle amplification
After the hybridization with HCV padlock probe, a large number of rolling circle amplification products can be obtained, such as reaction 5, 6, and 7. The rolled ring amplification products cannot be produced in the reaction system without adding cDNA, such as reaction 8.
The result of overnight reaction is shown below:
The eight reactions on the left were parallel. DNA degradation occurred when the amplification result of TB padlock probe was not very strong, probably because the Phi29 enzyme were contaminated by DNase. However, the HCV padlock probe remained consistent with the 2-hour reaction because of its strong reaction amplification results, and the experimental results showed no significant difference from the 2-hour reaction.
The eight reactions on the left are also parallel; because of the good quality and high activity of the Phi29 enzyme, TB and HCV padlock probe rolling circle amplifications are consistent with the results of 2 hours reaction. Among the reactions, HCV padlock probe showed a strong reaction amplification result and some tailing accumulation of reaction products, but the overall trend remained consistent with the 2-hour reaction result.
To sum up, the suggested reaction time is 2 hours, which is consistent with the reports in the reference.
#2、Experiment of competition-based rolling circle amplification
The annealing experiment is carried out according to the same method of experiment #1, as follows:
Ligation，the protocol is consistent with #1
Rolling PCR, the protocol is consistent with #1
1.  5ul product of the reaction mentioned above is taken; 10×phi29 DNA polymerase Reaction Buffer 2 ul, phi29 DNA polymerase 1 ul, BSA 0.5ul, 2.5mM dNTP 1ul, and ddH2O 10.5 ul are added; the reaction is run at 37°C for 2 hours.
2.  Take 4 ul reacted mixture，run 1%AGE，and observe whether rolling circle amplification products exist.
We also did two parallel reactions, using different T4 Ligase; the eight reactions on the left used T4 DNA Ligase from General Biology System Co., LTD, and the eight reactions on the right used T4 DNA Ligase from Biomics Biotech Co., LTD.
Experimental results show that cDNA3 can better promote the effect of padlock probe, and the rolled circle amplification products are the most abundant, which is consistent with experimental results. When there is a competitive aptamer, cDNA cannot effectively form sufficient double strands and ligate with the padlock probe, so the rolling circle amplification product is basically absent. When purified HCV core protein is added to the reaction, part of the cDNA can be released, thus contributing to circle amplification of the padlock probe. This trend is concentration dependent: the number of circle amplification products in the eighth lane is significantly higher than that in the seventh lane.
The T4 Ligase activity of the two different companies was slightly different, but the experimental results were well parallel and the trend was consistent.
Further experiment
The experimental method was unchanged, and the concentration gradient of the ligation products in the original reaction condition was diluted to detect the sensitivity of the probe, cDNA and at a lower concentration. When performing PCR, the reaction was too strong and sometimes inhibited. When the ligation product was diluted, the reaction products tended to be stable, of which 25 times was the best effect and 125 times was still effective. Therefore, the concentration of the probe can be as low as 100 times, i.e. 0.1uM, which is consistent with the report from the reference.
Psl333 eukaryotic expression plasmid was transfected into the 293 cell, and the protein was collected and extracted for experiment.
*Transfected granulocyte extract was positive protein P sample and non-transfected granulocyte extract was negative protein N sample
The above solution was diluted with multiple ratio of 1:5, 1:25, and 1:125, resulting in four parallel reactions of different concentrations
Water bath at 37℃ for 30 minutes.
Then add 2.5ul circle probe with different dilutions, and bathe at 67℃ for 30 minutes.
8ul of the reaction mixture is taken for ligation reaction.
