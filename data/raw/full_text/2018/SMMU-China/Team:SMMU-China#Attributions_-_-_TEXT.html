Miao Hu
Miao Hu was a wet lab member. He took control of all the cell experiments and took part in basic and compositive parts construction and others. And he also participated in the preparation of safety, protocol and notebook part in the wiki. He also did some dry lab works like HP, CCIC and so on when necessary.
Wei Shi
Wei Shi was working on the molecular cloning and parts-construction. Meanwhile, he played roles as an interviewer, propagandist and wiki author.
Yi Li
Yi Li managed in promoting our project and mainly helped in Human Practice.
YingShu Cui
YingShu Cui initially helped in both molecular cloning and cell experiments，meanwhile participated in Human Practice. Subsequently, she conceived and compiled all parts documentation, our wiki of parts, and incorporated graphical representation of parts.
Shulun
Shulun initially designed the BNP promoter and looked for potential application scenarios in clinical practice. He afterwards participated in the coordination of experiments and modeling including testing AR185 module and BNP promoter. In modeling, he put forward the RyR2 competitive phosphorylation model and built up simple equations.
Suowu Liu
Shuowu Liu was responsible for the wet lab. He mainly designed most cloning strategies, performed the mutation experiments and Participated in the design of videos and presentations.
Shaojun Mo
Shaojun Mo is more like a screw in the team, always going where you need him. From the illustrations, panels, posters that the team needs, to the development of various human practice projects, he has made a contribution. In addition, in the promotion of the team, such as the Himalayan FM, the vibrato APP, WeChat push platform, he also made a lot of efforts.
Shuyi Zhang
Shuyi Zhang is mainly responsible for designing how to show our project，she designed the logo of our team and the logo of our project. She created a lot of icons to help to explain our project. She also participated in the work of Human Practice.
Chuqi Wang
Chuqi Wang was responsible for parts constructions, parts documentation and some of the cell experiments as well.
Jizhou Liang
