Communication
CCIC(Conference of China iGEMer Community)，as one of the best communication platforms for iGEMers in China, has gone through its fifth birthday. SMMU-China, the new team for iGEM, participated in CCIC for the first time. In our point, CCIC is not only an opportunity for training but also for learning. On the other hand, CCIC plays a role of deadline so that periodical results have been made according to rules before the communication.
During the meeting, we listened to a few lectures given by Guoping Zhao, academician of CAS, and many other masters in synthetic biology. The different views of the masters on synthetic biology inspired us to look into the problem we met in our research in another way.
As a preview, three of our team members gave a presentation of our project in English and answered questions from judges and other iGEMers attending to the meeting. During the process, we found many drawbacks of our program, such as the bio-safety parts and modeling parts. We were suggested to hand over the safety form to the organizing committee of iGEM due to the use of AAV. We were also recommended to build a mathematical modeling, which should be closely attached to our research, to guide the production and ensure the effects of the antibodies. These parts were not considered in our project because we were not familiar with the rules and the competition. But, luckily, these problems were pointed out by the judges and iGEMers. In the poster presentation, our team visited many outstanding teams’ posters to learn about their experiment design and other good points in human practice, mathematical modeling and so on.
Near the end of CCIC, we joined in the round table conference with Meagan Lizarazo, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the iGEM Foundation. In the conference, Mrs. Meagan shared us experience on the Giant Jamboree, like how to deliver a good speech, attentions on the trip to America and so on. Through CCIC, we learned more about iGEM not only in the attentions and points, but also attracted by the positive research atmosphere. Everyone in the iGEM team had tried their best to fight for more and more achievements and came up with new and better ways to fix the teams’ trouble.
