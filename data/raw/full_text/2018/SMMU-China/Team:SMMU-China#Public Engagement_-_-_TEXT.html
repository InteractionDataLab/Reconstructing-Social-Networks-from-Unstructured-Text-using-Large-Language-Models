Summer Camp for High-School Student
Since the formation of the SMMU-China team, our members have been thinking about how to effectively promote synthetic biology and IGEM. In August 1st, outstanding students from 12 provinces/cities and 13 middle schools across the country have participated in the summer camp organized by our school.
Learning about this news, the iGEM team members are both excited and a little worried. We were excited about this excellent opportunity to show synthetic biology to everyone. But this is our first event, we don't want to make any mistakes. Anyway, we decided to seize this opportunity. After active preparation, we successfully held an exchange meeting between iGEM and synthetic biology on the evening of August 3.
The exchange introduced the concept of synthetic biology with the tyrannical Tyrannosaurus Rex in the science fiction film Jurassic World 2, showing the magical charm of synthetic biology. We also introduced detailed information about the iGEM competition, highlighting the creative and applied skills of the high school students who participated in the competition that inspired them to participate in iGEMer's high school student team. After a brief report, we used the form of interactive questions, asked the students questions with the little knowledge we mentioned, and presented a set of commemorative postcards with their own school features for the right friends. During the presentation of the poster, the students spoke freely and asked various questions to our team members, showing a strong interest in synthetic biology and iGEM. More than an hour of activity soon ended in a warm atmosphere.
All that was hoped was that more young students could become interested in the field of synthetic biology, to explore, to think, to discover, to change.
Lectures in Yanji geracomium
On September 23, we came to the Shanghai Yanji geracomium to give a lecture on heart failure prevention to the old people. On the day of the event, we were still a bit embarrassed, not knowing if our activities would achieve the desired results. Fortunately, the event was very successful.
During the lecture, our team members talked on the stage, and the audience was almost full. After the presentation, there are still many elderly people around the presenter to ask questions, while our other members are obliged to perform regular physical examinations for the elderly. After the event, the president of the nursing home thanked us for the wonderful presentations we had brought to the old people. Maybe we spent a short time in the nursing home, but as long as they can understand the importance of heart failure prevention and action in the days to come, our actions are meaningful.
Social medium
WeChat public platforms, as a popular form of media for all-round communication and interaction of text, pictures and voice among groups, have been widely used in recent years. In order to promote our project, to let more people know about our project and to achieve the promotion of synthetic biology and iGEM project, our team established our own Weichat public platform, the Internet Work Number. Whenever our team has a influential social practice, we will send a WeChat push to record the moment. For example, the summer camp, attending CCIC, you can find the details in our WeChat public platform.
As a new media, Shakes is appealing to the youth for the characteristics of short, fast and trendy. Our team used Shakes to record the details of our experiment, both happy and sad memories. Through this comedy form, we can record the problems we encountered in the operation of the experiment. In this way, we can not only spread the idea of joyful experiment, but also record our team's best memory of youth.
Himalaya FM, as the initiator of audiobooks, has great influence in China. We rely on this platform to introduce synthetic biology to our readers on the basis of the book Synthetic Biology and Applications written by Dr. Markus Schmidt.
Through all the new mediums we talk above, we are able to achieve a more diversified level of promotion work, which is an important reason for our use of these. By popularizing synthetic biology in a way popular with the mediums, we can achieve the final goal of human practice: to let more people understand synthetic biology, and really let synthetic biology come into the general public.
