Introduction
Although the calcium leakage plays a notable role in the development of Heart Failure (HF), it is hard to detect with noninvasive methods in clinical practice. The severity of HF can also be estimated by the level of calcium leakage, which in turn helps the clinical investors to determine the dosage and methodology of AAV based gene therapy. Therefore, we invented a software which can adopt the BNP expression level in patients' blood to reckon the level of calcium leakage, to choose of different AAVs and the to discriminate of expressing promoters.
Instruction
Objective
To provide a guiding dosage of composite AAV that carries functional intrabody sequencing according to advanced set-up mathematical modeling and data.
Content
1. Calcium leakage trending module
Based on the parameters of calcium iron (number of calcium sparkles, calcium stored in SR, the extent of calcium transient) to predict the trending of calcium leakage over time.
2. Treatment plan assisting module
Provide different treatment plans (titer of AAV, promoter, treatment time) for different objectives of therapeutic effect (such as reducing 90 percent calcium leakage, or 60 percent, etc.).
3. The custom setting assessment module
Evaluate the therapeutic effect according to the severity of disease and the selection of treatment plans.
Guilding
1. Calcium leakage trending module
a) Input: calcium iron parameters: including intervals between onset of heart failure and detection, the number of calcium sparkles, calcium storage of SR and the extent of calcium transient.
b) At least three groups data required.
c) Calculation: based on the calcium leakage predicting model, it could calculate the expectation of calcium leakage in a few days.
d) Output: provide a trend graph from attacking of heart failure.
2. Treatment plan assisting module
a)Input: select the target value of reducing calcium leakage;
b)Output: based on your combination of virus serotype, promoter, and serum BNP value to calculate the titer of the therapeutic virus required for treatment.
3. The custom setting assessment module
a) Input: user can select serotype of virus and promoter, etc.
b) Calculation: based on the custom setting above, this function could calculate the expectation of reduced calcium leakage fitting the model built before.
c) Output: the expectation of calcium leakage reduction.
