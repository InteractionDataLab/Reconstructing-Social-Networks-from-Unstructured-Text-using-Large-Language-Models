However, on the contrary, during the internship in cardiology department, there were too many patients cannot get cured for heart disease because there is no medicine can stop the process of heart failure, let alone reverse it. Currently, we can do nothing but watch the patientsâ€™ condition get deteriorating, and eventually evolve into heart failure. This not only poses a great threat to the physical and mental health of patients; on the other hand, patients' families also suffer tremendous economic pressure, bearing the annual medical burden.

Learning about this news, the iGEM team members are both excited and a little worried. We were excited about this excellent opportunity to show synthetic biology to everyone. Anyway, we decided to seize this opportunity. After active preparation, we successfully held an exchange meeting between iGEM and synthetic biology on the evening of August 3. The exchange introduced the concept of synthetic biology with the tyrannical Tyrannosaurus Rex in the science fiction film Jurassic World 2, showing the magical charm of synthetic biology. We also introduced detailed information about the iGEM competition, highlighting the creative and applied skills of the high school students who participated in the competition that inspired them to participate in iGEMer's high school student team. After a brief report, we used the form of interactive questions, asked the students questions on the  knowledge we mentioned, and presented a set of commemorative postcards with their own school features for the right friends. During the presentation of the poster, the students spoke freely and asked various questions to our team members, showing a strong interest in synthetic biology and iGEM.

										To get better understanding of heart failure, we visited the department of cardiology in Changhai and Changzheng hospital. By means of questionnaire and communication with the patients, we came to know that HF patients had to stay about 20 days per year in hospital to receive treatment. HF not only costs a huge amount of money but also reduced patientsâ€™ life quality. When consulting the experienced clinical doctors, the cruel truth was that no radical cure has been found for HF. The current treatments on HF are just the momentary relief for the symptoms, while the deterioration of heart is irreversible. On the other hand, the drugs costs a lot. Nowadays, the most promising way to cure HF is considered to be gene therapy. Thus, our team decided to work on gene therapy to solve this problem.

										Based on these, we have consulted with our primary PI, Professor Shi Hu, who is a leading scientist in the field of Antibody Engineering. He introduced a novel nanobody termed AR185 which has been recently developed by his group and showed specifically inhibition of RyR2 phosphorylation in vitro. The nanobody, containing a camel single-domain, is known as the smallest unit that can combine target antigens. Therefore, we hypothesis that targeting RyR2 using anti-phosphorylation agents may improve treatment efficacy. We used the tech of phage display and biopanning from Frances H. Arnold, George P. Smith and Gregory P. Winter, which has just awarded the Nobel prize in Chemistry in 2018. To evaluate its potential use for the treatment of heart failure, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) based intracellular antibody delivery strategy was adopt to achieve cardiac-specific gene therapy. Then we demonstrated therapeutic effect both in cell-based assays and in vivo models. Based on the truth that circulating levels of BNP was normally very low in healthy individuals and BNP level correlated well with ventricular wall stress and severity of HF, we put BNP promotor at the upstream of AR185 gene and used ET-1 to stimulate BNP promotor through a large variety of trans.

While, on the other hand, they also recommended that we should explore the other mechanisms that may result into HF.
