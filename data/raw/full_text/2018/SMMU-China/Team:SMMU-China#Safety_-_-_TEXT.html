Safety
Project safety
All of the parts and the experimental materials we used were reported before or in common use and in compliance with the iGEM’s regulations. We have also submitted a well-documented safety form about our project and laboratory. All cell experiments were operated in the cell lab, the virus experiments were carried in biosafety cabinets and all the experiments were carried in BSL-2 laboratory. The standard protocols which we have uploaded were strictly followed in all our experiments. The protein named AR185, expressed in cardiac muscle cells, is an intracellular nanobody which means it is harmless.
Laboratory Safety
According to China's regulations (Laboratory Biosafety Requirement-B19489, 2008) and Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories 5th edition, our iGEM laboratory belongs to BSL-2 laboratory. Our laboratory has met all the national requirements for BSL-2 safety level. In China, adeno-associated Virus 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9 have to be handled under the Biological Safety Level 2(BSL). And the animal experiment was also carried in ASL-2laboratory.
It was safety for us to carry on molecular, cellular as well as AAV9 experiments in our laboratory. Before we started the lab work, we trained all team members of the safety rules. Additional, we optimized the layout and equipment of our laboratory.
〇 The doors on the main entrance of the laboratory can be automatically closed, reducing the possibility of contamination caused by mosquitoes and other organisms entering through the door. The doors’ finger lock was applied to minimize unnecessary access to the laboratory by casual visitors or people not invited.
〇 We used red warning sign for dangerous electrical equipment and yellow warning sign for contaminated area where the electrophoresis experiments can be conducted.
〇 The AAV9 and cells experiments were conducted in an isolated cell house. And before entering and after leaving our cell house, we had to turn the UV light. When we were in the cell house, we must wear disinfected clothes and gloves.
〇 We installed monitor equipments to ensure the safety of lab materials.
〇 We checked all the electric circuit, water pipes and Ventilation equipment.
Human Safety
Each member had carefully read the laboratory code of conduct and relevant laws/regulations in china to prevent the unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins.
Safety on lab work is always regarded as the first priority. Equipments and drug safety are checked weekly, and we conducted group discussions weekly to guarantee safe operations.  Everyone in the lab has been trained for a while about how to conduct experiments in the correct way. And we formulated plans in advance in case of emergency accidents.
