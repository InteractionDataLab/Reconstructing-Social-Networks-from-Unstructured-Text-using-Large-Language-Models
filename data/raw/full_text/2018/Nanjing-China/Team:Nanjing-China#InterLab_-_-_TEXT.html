Summary
Our team  Nanjing-China used E. coli K-12 DH5-alpha to conduct the InterLab Study. The instrument used during our measurements is Tecan Infinite M1000  Pro plate reader which could read both fluorescence and absorbance from the  top of the plate. It has variable temperature settings and pathlength correction, which can  be disabled. By using this instrument, we have  accomplished assignments according to the PLATE READER AND CFU PROTOCOL, and  our data has also been accepted.
Problems:
Although we successfully  completed the InterLab study ultimately, during the process we also faced some  problems which quite puzzled us.
At first, we didn’t  understand the purpose of InterLab and were quite confused how to start this  project. But fortunately we solved these problems with the assistance from  Vinoo Selvarajah, the Director of the Registry and iGEM HQ Representative for  the 2018 competition and began this project.
Yet, due to the  ignorance of instrumental usage, we were upset by the problem of properly using  the plate reader. And our data is not correct because  of the improper manipulation. With the help of our secondary PI Peiqing Sun and  our advisor Kunlun Li, we finally obtained the correct data and the data were  accepted successfully.
During the process  of accomplishing the InterLab project, we experienced success and failure, we  have also learned plenty of things, such as the manipulation of some  instruments, scientific methods and so on.

Calibration Protocols
We used black plates with transparent bottom for the calibration  measurements, which had flat-bottomed wells.

Figure 1. OD600 Reference point
We used LUDOX CL-X as a single point reference to obtain a ratiometric  conversion factor to transform our absorbance data into a standard OD600 measurement. 
Calibration  2: Particle Standard Curve - Microsphere Protocol
Figure 2. Particle Standard Curve
Figure 3. Particle Standard Curve (log scale)
We prepared a dilution series of monodisperse silica  microspheres and measure the Abs600 in our plate reader. The size  and optical characteristics of these microspheres were similar to cells, and  there was a known amount of particles per volume. This measurement would allow  us to construct a standard curve of particle concentration which could be used  to convert Abs600 measurements to an estimated number of cells.
Calibration 3: Fluorescence standard curve - Fluorescein Protocol
Figure 4. Fluorescein Standard Curve
Figure 5. Fluorescein Standard Curve (log scale)
We prepared a dilution series of fluorescein in four  replicates and measure the fluorescence in a 96 well plate in our plate reader.  By measuring these in our plate reader, we generated a standard curve of  fluorescence for fluorescein concentration. We would be able to use this to  convert our cell based readings to an equivalent fluorescein concentration.
Cell measurement protocol
After completing all three of the calibration  measurements, we started performing the cell measurements. We use E. coli K-12 DH5-alpha strain, the same plates and volumes that we used in our  calibration protocol, as well as the same settings (e.g., filters or excitation  and emission wavelengths) that we used in our calibration measurements for the  sake of consistence.
