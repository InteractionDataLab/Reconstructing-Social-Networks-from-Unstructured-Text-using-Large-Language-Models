NOTEBOOK
Overview
Our  project lays emphasis on a vital aspect of energy utilization, thus it is  crucial that we have thought carefully and creatively about the impact of our  work and acquired the guidance of the design and experimental methods in our  project from the interaction with stakeholders and experts.
Firstly, we designed special brochures  to enlarge our team.
The next section, Background, is  about the development of nitrogenous fertilizer production in China as well as  the fact that free nitrogen, though substantial in the air, needs to overcome  considerable obstacle to react with other substances at normal temperature.  These have motivated us to further explore the actual effect of fertilizer.
By meeting with  stakeholders and experts, we were able to initiate the original idea of utilizing  solar energy to fix nitrogen, modify the experimental methods and reform our  design of device to be more relevant and responsible. The section of Integrated  Human Practices alsodemonstrateshow our project advanced as  the interactions with stakeholders and experts went on over time.
Brochure
Initially, to spread iGEM and get  more students on board with us, we printed and sent out brochures designed by  our team, which ultimately attracted students from different majors, equipping  our team with various talents.

Background
Nitrogenous  fertilizer production has been playing a pivotal role since the 20th  century. Yet, the fact is that the average soil nitrogenous fertilizer storage  all around the world is rather small. What’s more, the accumulation of nitrogen  in the soil is a tough process, and modern intensive agriculture leads to the  excessive loss of organic matter and nitrogen in the soil. Under most conditions,  the production of nitrogen in yield per unit is higher than that of phosphorus  and potassium nutrients.
In  the past decades, the industry of nitrogenous fertilizer in China has made  remarkable achievements through unremitting efforts, with capacity for  indigenous innovation constantly increasing. By 2017, China has become the largest  producer and consumer of nitrogenous fertilizer, greatly contributing to the  development of fertilizer industry and agriculture around the world.
With  the implementation of China's "five-in-one" policy, a large number of  contaminating factories have been shut down. We noted that Yantai Wuzhou Feng  Fertilizer Plant is located in the water conservation area of  Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Province, and its traditional method of producing nitrogenous  fertilizer consumes massive energy, meanwhile, causing large quantities of  pollution, which severely affects water and soil resource in the environment.
Integrated Human Practices
Xiaohe Bei Village
We  visited farmers in Xiaohe Bei Village, Ju County, Rizhao City, Shandong  Province, so that we could communicate with the users, direct stakeholders, of nitrogenous  fertilizer.
During the  conversation with them, we were informed that the nitrogenous fertilizer sold  on the market is of high cost, and the quality of it couldn’t be guaranteed.  Farmers are in urgent need of fertilizer products with guaranteed quality and  affordable prices.
Based on our previous work (Nanjing-China 2016) on  photosynthetic hydrogen production, we wondered whether we could utilize solar  energy to fix nitrogen, which is an environmentally-friendly and economical  method for production.
Yantai Wuzhou Feng Fertilizer Plant
With  the idea of photosynthetic nitrogen fixation, we contacted Yantai Wuzhou  Feng Fertilizer Plant.
During  the course of the exchange, the manager of Yantai Wuzhou Fertilizer Plant, Mr  Li, told us the technical bottlenecks encountered so far. The main production  of nitrogenous fertilizer, urea, was still following traditional methods, with  liquid ammonia and carbon dioxide as raw materials and then urea directly  synthesized under conditions of high temperature and pressure.
After fully understanding the current production and demand of nitrogenous fertilizer, we introduced our project to them, and proposed applying synthetic biology to realize photosynthetic nitrogen fixation, which would not only cut down cost but also effectively reduce environmental pollution. They expressed great interest in the application of synthetic biology for nitrogen fixation and the use of solar energy, a clean energy source for production.
Yet,  they raised some problems that might arise in the production process as well,  such as the contamination of cadmium sulfide, semiconductor materials attached  to the surface of Escherichia coli, whether cadmium sulfide would affect  the physiological activity of Escherichia coli or not, how to convert  nitrogen fixation inside engineered bacteria into mass production of nitrogenous  fertilizer and so on. We carefully collected these problems above.
Improvement of our project
When  we came back, we seriously considered these practical problems in experimental  design and continuously improved experimental method.
Firstly,  toxicity test was conducted to determine the maximum amount of Cd2+  that is agreeable for E. coli growth.
For  further information about this experiment, please check it out on our  protocol and result page.
Moreover,  in order to apply our nitrogen fixation system to practical use, maybe into  mass production in the future, we also came up with an idea of designing a device  for the growth of engineered strain. Our integrated human practices  strategy helped us to look at how we could make our device as user-friendly as  possible.
Interactions with microbial researchers
At  the beginning, we designed a device consisting of 3 modules: incubation,  illumination, control, which is suitable for engineered strain to grow and  participate in reaction under adjustable light conditions.
Our  interactions with microbial researchers shaped our final design and made it  possible for practical application. When xenon modulator tube is illuminating,  it would heat the air inside incubator, thus making the environment unfavorable  for our engineered strain.
To  solve this problem, we were advised to place a reflux condenser to cool the  xenon modulator tube, keeping the most suitable temperature.
For further information about this device, please  check it out on our  hardware page.
