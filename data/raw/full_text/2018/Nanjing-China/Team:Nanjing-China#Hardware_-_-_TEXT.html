NOTEBOOK
In order to apply our system to practical use, we also designed a  device consisting of 4 modules: incubation, illumination, control and  condensation. In our design draft, we hide all the tube-like parts to make the  main body of the device clearer.
The incubation module is a shaker inside an incubator which can  shake the flask, so that the engineered strain can grow and participate in  reaction in agreeable conditions.
For the illumination module, we choose xenon modulator tube as the  light source. However, it requires high voltage to be excited, so we also add a  potential transformer to convert 220 voltage to higher voltage.
Another problem is that when xenon  modulator tube is illuminating, it would heat the air inside incubator, thus  making the environment unfavorable for our engineered strain. To solve this problem, we place a reflux condenser to cool the xenon  modulator tube, keeping the most suitable temperature.
The control module is the brain of the  entire device. It directly controls the temperature inside the incubator and the  speed of shaker. The ill module is the brain of the  entire device. The illumination intensity can also be regulated by altering  the position of the xenon modulator tube.
Our device can not only be applied to nitrogen fixation process, but  also serve as a reactor for other similar light-driven reactions, such as  hydrogen production and carbon fixation. We believe, after further promotion it  will have a fairly promising prospect.
