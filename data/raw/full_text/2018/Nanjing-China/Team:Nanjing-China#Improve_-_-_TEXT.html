NOTEBOOK
The existing part, BBa_K1796007 , is an essential component of the Paenibacillus  sp. WLY78’s nitrogen fixation gene (nif)  cluster arranged in the order of nifB, nifH, nifD, nifK, nifE, nifN, nifX, hesA, nifV. Instead of directly cloning WLY78 nifB using BBa_K1796007 as the template, a minimal nif cluster from Paenibacillus  polymyxa CR1 that also contained nifB  (nucleoid acid sequence similarity 96% as compared to WLY78 nifB) was chemically synthesized and  incorporated into commercially available cloning vector pUC57. After that, CR1 nifB was obtained by PCR amplification  using pUC57-nif as the template and  subsequently introduced into pSB1C3 backbone through restriction enzyme  digestion. Below, we discuss why we made such an improvement:
(1) Both nifB genes from WLY78  and CR1 contain unwanted restriction sites that can not meet the compatibility  requirements of the iGEM Parts Guidelines. Therefore, elimination of these site  through chemical synthesis is necessary.
(2) The complete genome of Paenibacillus polymyxa CR1 has  been thoroughly sequenced and deposited in NCBI with the accession number  CP006941.2. Considering that there exist some other genes possessing regulatory  function for the nif cluster, nifB of a bacterium with clear genetic  background, such as Paenibacillus polymyxa CR1, may be more valuable for  researchers of relevant field.
In addition, to test whether the nifB  could express in gram-negative E. coli JM109 as a part of the nif cluster,  pUC57-nif was inreoduced into JM109  via electroporation (Figure 1a). But before qRT-PCR determination, the function  and strength of the native promoter in nif cluster (Pnif) were firstly tested in  JM109 by fusing Dronpa as the reporter. T5 promoter (BBa_M50075) served as  control. As shown in Figure 1b, compared with T5 promoter, Pnif was much stronger in driving the  expression of RFP and its expression pattern was constitutive. Transcriptional  analysis was carried out afterward. As shown in Figure 2, Pnif was strong enough to drive the expression of each structure  gene in the nif cluster including nifB though with different relative  expression level.

Hopefully, the aforementioned improvements and relevant testing results can facilitate the utilization of the improved part for other iGEM team.
