NOTEBOOK
Overview
Our design is composed of three parts: biosynthesis of CdS semiconductor, light-driven nitrogen fixation and a light-driven biohybrid reaction device. This system is the expansion of our previous project of hydrogen production (Nanjing-China 2016), and it proves that surface display mechanism is capable of being expanded to a general principle for light-driven biohybrid reactions.
Biosynthesis of CdS semiconductor on cell surface
To construct our light-driven system, we induce the in situ synthesis of CdS semiconductor on the E. coli cell surface. One key element of our system is fused protein OmpA-PbrR. OmpA (Outer membrane  protein A) fixes the protein complex on outer cell membrane while PbrR (lead-specific binding protein) adsorbs Cd2+ in the environment and further forms CdS  semiconductor on cell surface.
After Cd2+ ions are added  into the culture, the ions specifically bind to PbrR protein contributing to the  aggregation of Cd2+. Combining with S2- ions in the  media, CdS semiconductors are therefore formed on the outer membrane of cells.

Light-driven nitrogen fixation in E. coli cells
When the system is exposed in light, electrons of  the CdS semiconductor conduct  transit, and CdS provide these  excited electrons to the electrons to Mo-Fe protein subunit of nitrogenase. Subsequently, the Mo-Fe protein utilizes the energy from these  electrons to reduce N2(dinitrogen) to NH3(ammonia). Finally, the semiconductor regains its lost electron from sacrificial electron donors.
This design is of general applications as OmpA  protein is merely a surface display mechanism forÂ E. coli, and PbrR can be  replaced with other proteins with different specificity.

Reaction device
We also designed a light-driven biohybrid reaction device to apply our system to practical use. After a few test, we proved our device to be quite practical. (see hardware for more details)
