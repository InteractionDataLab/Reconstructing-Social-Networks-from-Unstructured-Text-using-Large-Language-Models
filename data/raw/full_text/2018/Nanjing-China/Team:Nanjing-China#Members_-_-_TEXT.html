Haojie Jiang
✎ What doesn't kill me makes me stronger!
♔ Haojie Jiang is the team leader of Nanjing-China this year. He takes an active part in almost every phase and aspect of the entire procedure of this project. Significantly, when he sensed difficulty in the introduction period, he successfully organized the team to systematically obtain knowledge on synthetic biology and hence creates firm background knowledge for the whole team. Sharing the responsibility of project design, he also confidently devotes himself to the following teamwork arrangement. When it comes to Human Practices, he still stands in the frontline, working with his teammates with everlasting passion.
✎Thanks to the experience, I tried new things, got more knowledge and challenged myself.
♖ Yixuan Cui is the one who performs the experiments of nif gene, as well as establishes the structure and writes the details of the wiki. She took charge of the wiki designing last year and still takes that task for us this year, ensuring that we do not have problems with it.

Qian Dong
✎ If not now, when? If not you, who?
♖ Qian Dong is the central character who is in charge of the Human Practices part in Nanjing-China team. Born with the gift for communicating and the passionate nature, she is no doubt the best one to deal with this job. Among considerable responsibilities, the main one for her is to contact with other iGEM teams on behalf of Nanjing-China team. She also takes charge of other HP-related work and closely links team’s project with practical applications: seeking possibility in quantitative production and promoting achievement in the lab to the vast world of beings.
✎ Keep moving. Don't settle.
♜Yansong Huang, one of the student members, is mainly responsible for the lab work.  With scrupulous attitude and passion for science, he has been sorting out relevant data and materials as well as preparing detailed experiment methods. It is exactly with his careful work that our research can move forward.

Zhaoqing Hu
✎ I came; I saw; I conquered.
♟Zhaoqing Hu is a sophomore in School of Life Sciences, Nanjing university. He is in charge of part of the experimental work, including analyzing data crucial to the research. His rigorous attitude and operation ensure the smooth process of our project. With an optimistic character, he keeps on cheering the whole team up during the course even if it is tough or tiring.
✎ Give it away until it‘s gone.
♙ Yuanyuan Li participates in vital paperwork of our team this year. Not only does she always act with caution and carefulness, she is also a person of great honesty and high teamwork spirit. She is broadly knowledgeable about biochemistry both in theory and in practice, contributing a lot to our study. She believes that cooperation among Nanjing-China team members will broaden her horizon and enhance her faith in further research.

Yifan Ma
✎ Don’t follow the crowd. Let the crowd follow you.
♙Yifan Ma is in charge of the English writing and presentation work. As a member of our team, she conscientiously works on all the tasks assigned with and fulfills them the best she can. Ma is also enthusiastic about helping with every part, like making proposals about team construction and offering a hand when other team members are too busy. “Just trying to be the best version of myself”, she said.
✎ I am a slow walker, but I never walk backwards.
♟ Xiangyu Xu is crucial to the team for he is in charge of presenting the project to others in the best way. Being good at designing and drawing, he creates the team’s wiki page which is an important way to show project out and draws the mechanism diagrams of the project to show processes step by step clearly. Moreover, he publishes a brochure about iGEM and the team Nanjing-China to make them more widely known. His outstanding ability and enthusiasm will continue to help the team in gaining attention both online and offline.

Ruoyan Zhang
✎ Choose what you love, love what you choose.
♟Ruoyan Zhang is a sophomore in the School of Life Sciences who is responsible for modeling and copywriting in the team. She does well in mathematics and has great interest in modeling. With great creativity, conscientiousness and enthusiasm for synthetic biology, she will definitely be very helpful to the project. She is going to construct appropriate models and plot graphics to mimic biological systems relevant to the project in order to provide useful guidance to future experiments. Besides, she has already published a text on team’s website together with two other teammates.
