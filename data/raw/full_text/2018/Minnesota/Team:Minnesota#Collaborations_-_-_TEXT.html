Collaboration:
_____We collaborated with Washington University St. Louis. We first communicated through email and we decided to share our yeast strain with them. We cultured our yeast strain with YPD media overnight. We aliquot drop of cultured yeast on autoclaved filter paper and wrap the filter paper with clean foil. The yeast was delivered to Washington University St. Louis and they successfully obtained the yeast from the filter paper and used the cell for their experiments. We also collaborated with University of California, Santa Cruz. They traveled to our campus during the summer and we guided them to tour our lab and several buildings located on the East Bank of our campus. Then we had a meeting together to share some details of our lab methodologies and human practice preparations. Since we started our project earlier then them, we were able to make some suggestions on plasmid construction and general lab techniques. Team UCSC put a lot of effort in their human practice activities and they showed us their description of their project as a whole. Their Professor also gave us some feedback on our project design, and we did some revisions on this part in the follow up experiments
