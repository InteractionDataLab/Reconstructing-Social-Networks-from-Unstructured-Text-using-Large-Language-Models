TEAM MEMBERS
_NAME:Zhipeng Ding (Team Leader)
I am a senior student major in Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics at the University of Minnesota,
also the team leader of this year’s iGEM team Minneasota. This is my second year of attending iGEM,
I have  obtained incredibly valuable and fulfilling experience from iGEM 2017
thus deciding to continue to participate  in 2018. My research interest is protein engineering and microbial engineering.
_NAME:Ziyuan Wang
I am a senior student studying Microbiology at the University of Minnesota.
My interest is listening to Rock and Roll music, playing Pokemon Go and traveling.
I am in charge of Lab Safety in our project, and I also participate in the wet lab
and human practice activities.
_NAME:JackReddan
I am a junior student at the University of Minnesota, and I am majoring in Microbiology and Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development.
The reason I decided to join the iGEM team is because I am fascinated by the microbial world, and this was a fantastic way to apply concepts I have learned
in the classroom for the purpose of producing, and informing the public on the production of, a biological tool for assisting in the important process of bioremediation.
_NAME:Xinrao Zhang
I am a senior student major in Mathematics at the University of Minnesota.
The reason why I joined the iGEM team 2018 is that I want to apply the knowledge that I learned from classroom to practical application.
My research interest is dynamical system modeling. Therefore I believe iGEM modeling of the kinetics of cell
growth will provide me on hand application of our project.
_NAME:Zihao Li
I’m a junior student major in Biomedical Engineering. I like dota, skiing and playing basketball.
I’m in charge of construction of plasmid; and I also help with the wet lab.
I joined this project because I’m pretty interested in genetic engineering.
_NAME:Yixuan Liu
I am a junior majoring in Biomedical Engineering. I like playing tennis, biking, and driving.
I am in charge of the construction of two plasmids in the wet lab part of our project.
I joined this project because       I enjoy using my knowledge to solve some real-world problems.
_NAME:Benjamin Alva
I’m a sophomore majoring in Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development at the University of Minnesota.
Joining iGEM 2018 was a no-brainer because it combined my love of biotechnology and competition,
offering the chance to expand my laboratory experience and lay a foundation for a successful career in bioengineering.
