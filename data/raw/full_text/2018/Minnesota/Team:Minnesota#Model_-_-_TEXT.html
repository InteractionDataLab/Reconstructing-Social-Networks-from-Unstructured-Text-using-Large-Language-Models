Model:
We used Monod growth model to modify the bacteria growth curve at IPTG as the substrate. The equation is μ(t)=μmax*S(t)/(K+S(t)) where,
μ is the growth rate at a certain time, μmax is the highest growth rate for the whole system, S is the substrate(IPTG) concentration which will change based on time and K is half velocity constant.
The equation of substrate changing is S’(t)= (-1/Y)*x’(t), where Y is the yield coefficient. x’(t) is given microbial growth rate for the population x(t) that equals μ(t)*x(t).
In this model, we assumed that K= 0.02 mg/L, μmax= 0.1 h^-1, Y=0.8.
