Interlab:
Experience:
The protocols were simply followed as what IGEM provided on the website.
Calibration 1: OD600 Reference Point using LUDOX:
Table 1:Corrected value is particle-only contribution.
Reference value is for 100uL of LUDOX CL-X in a well of a standard 96-well flat-bottom
black with clear bottom plate Corrected value = scaling factor * measured value.
Calibration 2: Microspheres
Table 2:Microsphere Absorbance in Serial Dilutions Raw Data.
Figure 1:Particle Standard Curve.
Figure 2:Particle Standard Curve on Log Scale.
Final scaling level determined from medium-high points likely to be less impacted by saturation or pipetting error.
