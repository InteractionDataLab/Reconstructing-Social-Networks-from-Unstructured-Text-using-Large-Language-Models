EDUCATION AND ENGAGEMENT
Henry Sibley High School
_____Henry Sibley High School, located just 9 miles away from the University of Minnesota campus in Mendota heights, is a public highschool that produces countless intelligent and driven students, of which many go on to the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. Benjamin Alva and Ziyuan Wang presented the iGEM UMN 2018 project to current Advanced Placement Biology students of Henry Sibley High School on October 9th. This objective of this presentation was to inform up and coming high school students of the opportunity and novelty that is involved in the work of biotechnology researchers and developers. Utilizing our project to highlight the complexity and wonder of the potential of synthetic biology. We received great feedback from the many students in attendance. Special thanks to Advanced Placement Biology Teacher Eric Frieberg for helping to organize this event.
