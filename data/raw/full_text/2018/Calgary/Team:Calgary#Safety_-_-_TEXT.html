Safety and Ethical Risks
Our gene integration strategy was designed for use in existing ex vivo gene                 transfer processes to mediate targeted integration. The immediate use case is constrained to research                 projects in lab environments, however the strategy could hypothetically also be used eventually in gene                 therapies to correct recessive genetic diseases by integrating DNA encoding for the wild type,                 functional protein. The system could, with little modification, be used to integrate arbitrarily large                 DNA constructs into virtually any genome. The risks of this enablement are extensive, but do not                 greatly exceed existing gene transfer technologies. The off-target activity of CRISPR/Cas9 is well                 established, and may result in the integration of the transgenic construct outside of the targeted                 genomic safe harbour. However, such risk is negligible compared to the pseudorandom integration typical                 of virus-mediated integration. Although the strategy may be appropriate for eventual use in human gene                 therapy, that potential is beyond the scope of our work. Further evaluations and investigations into                 the ethical risks of our project can be seen on our Integrated Human Practices page.
Safety in the Lab
Before beginning work in the lab, all team members, mentors, and Principal                 Investigators completed lab safety courses developed by the University of Calgary Environment Health and Safety (EHS) services. The courses                 covered a wide range of topics such as occupational health and safety, laboratory safety, hazard                 assessment, incident reporting and investigation, spill response, biosafety, bloodborne pathogens, and                 WHMIS. The completion of these courses ensured that everyone on the team worked safely in the lab and                 could respond to incidents or hazards appropriately. Furthermore, the University of Calgary Biosafety Committee outlines guidelines for safe                 biological laboratory practices. These guidelines were observed and adhered to during all of our                 experimental work.
Our project used a common lab strain of Escherichia coli, DH5-alpha.                 This strain is non-pathogenic and is classified as Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1), therefore its use posed                 low risk to researchers. We also used an immortalized human cell line, HEK293T cells, which are Risk                 Group 1 organisms. HEK293T cells have adenovirus genetic contents and Simian Virus 40 large T antigen                 (SV40T), however, these cells do not contain the complete viral genomes, therefore the risk of viral                 particle generation by these cells is low (ATCC, 2016). The cells are not themselves infectious, are                 not known to carry any disease-causing agents, and are virtually unable to survive outside of the lab.                 All experiments with HEK293T cells was done in a BSL-2 Biosafety Cabinet to ensure the safety of                 researchers and to work within University of Calgary safety guidelines. Our lab is a certified BSL-2                 lab, therefore it was equipped for safe work with both E. coli DH5-alpha and HEK293T cells.
