                    improvement of Part <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K747096" target="blank">BBa_K747096</A></B></P><P style="text-indent: 0px">Both parts are the constitutive mammalian cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter,
                however our part is an improvement on BBa_K747096 by the <B>addition of a SalI restriction site</B> to
                the 5' end of the promoter. The addition of the SalI restriction site allows for the promoter to be
                used within our Multiple-Cloning Site flanked by FRT sites (more info on the Multiple Cloning-Site and
                its usage can be found <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Calgary/Parts">here</A>). Although several
                CMV promoters exist in the registry, we chose to improve upon BBa_K747096 for two reasons; it was
                available in the 2018 iGEM distribution kit and it was relatively well-characterized.</P><P style="text-indent: 0px">The SalI restriction site (sequence: GTCGAC) was added to BBa_K747096 via
                overhang PCR. Overhang PCR is just like regular PCR except the primers that are used contain both a
                complementary annealing region and additional 5' or 3' nucleotides, which are not complementary to the
                target sequence. The &quot;overhanging&quot; 5' or 3' nucleotides are incorporated into the PCR product and this
                allows for the addition of nucleotides to the end(s) of your target sequence.</P><P style="text-indent: 0px">To create our improved part, BBa_K2605001, we first rehydrated the DNA of part
                BBa_K747096 in the 2018 iGEM distribution kit then transformed it into chemically competent <I>E. coli</I>
                DH5-alpha cells. The plasmid DNA was extracted and the SalI restriction site was added with overhang
                PCR. We used the forward and reverse primers pictured below (figure 1), which contain the SalI
             	restriction site in the overhang region of the forward primer.</P><P class="caption">Figure 1. Forward and reverse primers used in overhang PCR for the addition of a SalI restriction site. All nucleotides on the forward primer upstream of and including the SalI site are the non-complementary, &quot;overhanging&quot; portion of the primer. </P><H3 class="infosubtitle">Experimental Characterization </H3><P style="text-indent: 0px">Restriction enzyme digest was used to confirm the addition of the SalI
                restriction site to the CMV promoter. pSB1C3-BBa_K2605001 and pSB1C3-BBa_K747096 were digested with
                either NotI (to confirm part size) or SalI/SpeI (to confirm the presence of the SalI restriction site).
                As expected, NotI cut both plasmids and produced a roughly 600kb insert while SalI/SpeI only produced a
                600kb insert from our improved part, pSB1C3-BBa_K2605001. Since pSB1C3-BBa_K747096 only contains a SpeI
                site, the plasmid was linearized and the insert band was not produced. The results of this restriction
                enzyme digest can be seen below (figure 2).
            </P><P class="caption">Figure 2. Digest confirmations of <B>[A]</B> pSB1C3-BBa_K2605001 and <B>[B]</B>pSB1C3-BBa_K747096 . The plasmid was double digested with SalII and SpeI or single digested with NotI  then run on a 1.5% agarose gel at 100 V for 35 minutes. The molecular ladder (L) is visible on the far left and the expected band sizes, obtained from Benchling Virtual Digest, are visible in the diagram on the right. Undigested plasmid (U) was used as a control.</P><P style="text-indent: 0px">To verify that our improved part could still function as a promoter, both parts
                were ligated to a red fluorescent protein (RFP) reporter gene optimized for bacteria (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_J06504" target="blank">BBa_J06504</A>), which was found in the 2018 iGEM distribution kit. Although
                CMV promoters are normally used for mammalian expression, it also functions as a promoter in <I>E. coli</I>
                (Lewin et al., 2005), therefore it could be used to express the RFP reporter gene that was fused to it.
            </P><P style="text-indent: 0px">First, restriction enzyme digest was used to confirm that the ligation of our
                improved part (BBa_K2605001) and the old part (BBa_K747096) to the RFP reporter gene
                (pSB1C3-BBa_J06504). The constructs were digested with SalI/NcoI I to validate this. Again, both
                constructs produced different band sizes, due to the additional SalI site present on the construct with
                our improved part. The results of this restriction enzyme digest can be seen below (figure 3).
            </P><P class="caption">Figure 3. Digest confirmations of <B>[A]</B> pSB1C3-BBa_J06504 fused to BBa_K2605001 and <B>[B]</B>pSB1C3-BBa_J06504 fused to BBa_K747096 . The plasmid was double digested with SalII and NcoI then run on a 1.5% agarose gel at 100 V for 35 minutes. The molecular ladder (L) is visible on the far left and the expected band sizes, obtained from Benchling Virtual Digest, are visible in the diagram on the right. Undigested plasmid (U) was used as a control.
</P><P style="text-indent: 0px">Then, the digest-confirmed CMV-RFP constructs and RFP alone (pSB1C3-BBa_J06504,
                negative control) were transformed into chemically competent <I>E. coli</I> DH5-alpha cells. Successful
                transformants were plated and imaged after 48h, at which time RFP production could be seen in both
                CMV-RFP constructs (figure 4, figure 5), while the negative control remained colourless (figure 4) as
                RFP could not be produced without a CMV promoter.

                maintained its function as a promoter.
