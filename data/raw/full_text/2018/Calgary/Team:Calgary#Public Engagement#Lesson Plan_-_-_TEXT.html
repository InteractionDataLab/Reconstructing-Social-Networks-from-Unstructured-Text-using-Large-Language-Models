Lecture Presentation
Ask students if they've ever heard of synthetic biology – do they know what it is?
The central dogma of molecular biology is key to understanding and defining synthetic biology
The central dogma of molecular biology refers to the transmission of genetic information held in                             DNA to RNA, then to proteins
First, the DNA is used as a template to create RNA by a process called transcription
RNA is used as a template to create proteins in a process called translation
DNA is a double-stranded molecule twisted in the shape of a double-helix
The information in DNA, also known as the "genetic code", is stored in the sequence of bases (adenine,                             guanine, cytosine, and thymine)
Adenine pairs with thymine, while cytosine pairs with guanine. Each line in the DNA diagram represents                             one of these "pairs"
Every individual has unique DNA code
DNA is converted to RNA by the process of transcription
RNA is a single-stranded molecule
RNA sequence is derived from the sequence of base pairs on a DNA molecule
Instead of thymine, RNA contains a uracil base
Not all DNA is converted to RNA: only certain parts of DNA that can code for proteins are converted                             to RNA
RNA is converted to proteins through the process of translation
Every three bases in RNA codes for a single amino acid. For example, AUG codes for methionine
There are only four bases, but 20 different amino acids
Proteins have many functions within a cell
They can synthesize molecules, breakdown molecules
Synthetic biology can be defined as the laboratory editing of any of the processes involved in the                             central dogma
DNA, RNA, or proteins can be edited to make the cell do different things
Can manipulate the colour, shape, size, function, etc. of the cells
For example, if you put a gene that codes for the red fluorescent protein (RFP) in E. coli, the cell                             will glow red
There are many ways in which synthetic biologists can edit DNA, RNA, or Proteins
There are three common techniques that are very important for the work that scientists do in the                             lab
Digestion/ligation
PCR amplification
Gel electrophoresis
Digestions/ligations are a way to insert new fragments of DNA into an existing piece of DNA
Special proteins called "restriction enzymes" can recognize specific sequences called "restriction                             sites" in the DNA
The restriction enzyme will bind to the DNA and cut the DNA at that specific sequence
The process of the DNA being cut by a restriction enzyme is called a "restriction digestion"
Restriction enzymes often cut the DNA twice: once on each strand
They often cut close together but not on the exact same spot, resulting in "DNA overhangs", which                             are short sequences of single-stranded DNA
The DNA insert is designed to have ends with overhangs that match the overhangs on our digested DNA
The overhangs match with one another and the DNA comes together
DNA ligase is used to seal the DNA together
Repaired DNA is now stable and can be transcribed and translated
The next technique we will look at is PCR amplification
PCR, which stands for "polymerase chain reaction", is a method of amplifying a small section of DNA
This method works by first denaturing (separating strands) of DNA by heating it to 95 degrees
Lowering the temperature attaches "primers" onto the DNA
Primers are short DNA sequences that flank the region you want to amplify
Afterwards, DNA is heated to 75 degrees to synthesize DNA
The PCR reaction repeats these steps for 30-40 cycles
PCR amplifies the fragment of DNA between the two primers exponentially
This is because after each cycle, the newly synthesized DNA can act as a "template" DNA for the next                             cycle
Gel electrophoresis is used to identify the lengths of DNA fragments
DNA is loaded into wells at the top of a gel and a current is run through
DNA, being negatively charged, will travel towards through pores in the gel to the positive end of                             the gel
Longer strands of DNA will face more friction from the pores, and travel slower than shorter bands,                             which will travel further down the gel
The DNA separates into "bands" in accordance to their size
When visualized under UV light, the bands fluoresce
The bands can be compared with a DNA "ladder" of known lengths to determine their size
Enjoy the Strawberry DNA Extraction activity!
Part B: Strawberry DNA Extraction
Lesson Type: Demonstration/Performance
Learning Objectives:
Describe how DNA is packaged within the cell
Explain the differences between strawberry cells and human cells
Understand how histones are removed from DNA
Background
The adult human body contains trillions of cells - each incredibly small and impossible to see with the naked                 eye. Within each of those cells, there is a bundle of DNA called the nucleus which contains almost all of your genetic information. Inside each nucleus, which is 6 micrometers                 in diameter, are 46 chromosomes of DNA, for a total of 3 billion base pairs. Although each base pair is microscopically small, we have enough DNA in each of                 our cells to amount to 2 meters in length when stretched out. Inside our cells, our DNA doesn’t exist as                 elongated strands. Instead, the DNA in our cell is wrapped tightly around proteins called histones, allowing for large stretches of DNA to be condensed into a structure called chromatin.
Humans are a diploid organism, meaning we have two copies of each of the 23 chromosomes in our cells. Strawberries, which we will be extracting DNA from today, has 8 copies of                 each chromosome, making it an octoploid organism. Because they have so many copies of each chromosome, its cells contain much more                 DNA than our cells do, making the DNA easier to see when removed from the cell.
DNA in strawberry cells can be made visible to the naked eye as long as many cells are broken open and the DNA                 is separated from the histones that package the DNA. First, the cells are broken apart using a detergent                 that disrupts the membrane layer of the cell. Then, DNA is separated from the histones via simple ionic interactions.                 When the cell is flooded with aqueous NaCl, the Na+ ions bind to the negatively-charged DNA molecules, and the Cl- ions bind to the positively-charged histones, separating the two. This mixture is filtered to remove excess cell debris.                 Lastly, a layer of alcohol is added to the mixture. DNA, which is soluble in water and insoluble in alcohol,                 will collect at the meeting between the water and alcohol layers.
Materials (per student):
2 strawberries
1 ziploc bag
20mL strawberry extraction buffer
5 reactions of buffer can be made from
10mL detergent
90mL water
1.5g of NaCl
1 coffee filter
1 beaker or plastic cup
10mL ethanol
1 stir rod or toothpick
Procedure:
Place a strawberry in a ziploc bag. Seal the bag and squish the strawberry in the bag until the mixture is                     smooth.
Measure 20 mL of the strawberry extraction buffer and pour it into the ziploc bag.
Seal the bag and gently mix the contents. Try to avoid forming bubbles in the bag.
Place a coffee filter inside a beaker or plastic cup. Pour the contents of the bag into the coffee filter.                     Let sit for 10 minutes.
Gently squeeze the sides of the filter paper to push any remaining liquid through the filter paper.
Measure 10 mL of ethanol and pour gently down the side of the cup. Let sit for 5 minutes.
Use a toothpick or stir rod to swirl in between the alcohol and water layers. Remove toothpick to see DNA!

Answers
Multiple Choice
1. D; 2. A; 3. D; 4. C; 5. A
Short Answer
1. DNA is "packaged" by tightly winding around proteins called histones to create a structure called chromatin.
2. Positively charged Na+ ions bind to negatively charged DNA, and negatively charged Cl- binds to positively-charged                 histones, resulting in the separation of DNA from histones.
3. The DNA strand is denatured (separated into two strands) at 95 degrees. At 55 degrees, the PCR primers anneal                 to the DNA. afterwards, the DNA is heated to 72 degrees, stimulating Taq DNA polymerase activity, resulting                 in DNA elongation.
