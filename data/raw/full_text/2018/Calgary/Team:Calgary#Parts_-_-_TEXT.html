Parts Collection
Parts BBa_K2605000 to BBa_K2605004 and BBa_K2605009 comprise the first                 iteration of a novel toolkit for targeted gene integration and maintenance of expression in eukaryotic                 chassis. The collection contains chromatin-modifying elements that limit silencing of the integrated                 gene and minimize neighborhood effects. These elements, as well as the mCherry-BGH reporter gene with                 our improved CMV promoter, have restriction sites for directional cloning into part BBa_K2605002, which                 is a Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) flanked by distinct FRT (FLP recombinase recognition target) sites.
In the first iteration of our gene integration strategy,                 the FRT sites are leveraged for recombinase-mediated casette exchange (RMCE).                 Representing an experimental second design, BBa_K2605006 is a prototype part intended to test                 our novel FLP-Beta strategy. For either RMCE or FLP-Beta, the toolkit is intended to leverage                 genome-integrated recombinase target sites.
Each part in this collection (except BBa_K2605002 and BBaK260506) is designed                 with two different restriction sites on either end to allow for simple bi-directional cloning. The                 entire MCS is flanked by SapI restriction sites so that the entire cloning site and FRT sites can be                 transferred to different plasmids. AflII restriction sites flank the MCS interior of the FRT sites so                 that only the MCS can be transferred to different plasmids. A schematic of our MCS (BBa_K2605002) can                 be seen below.
The figure below shows an example of how chromatin-modifying elements and a                 reporter gene can be used in our system. The restriction sites for bi-directional cloning of each part                 is shown.

Basic Parts
BBa_K2605000 - mCherry +                     BGH
mCherry red fluorescent protein (RFP) codon-optimized for expression in                 human/mammalian cells with a BGH terminator attached. The addition of BGH makes this part an                 improvement of the original mCherry part, BBa_J176005 .
BBa_K2605001 - CMV with                     5'                     SalI restriction site
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter with an additional 5' SalI site, which allows                 this promoter to be used within our Multiple-Cloning Site flanked by FRT sites. This is an improvement                 of part BBa_K747096 and you can                 learn more about its characterization and improvement here .
BBa_K2605002 - Multiple                     cloning site with flanking FRT sites
Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) flanked by distinct FRT (FLP recombinase                 recognition target) sites. The MCS carries sites for an arbitrary construct to be directionally cloned.                 The MCS was designed for our first iteration of targeted gene integration, which involved                 recombinase-mediated casette exchange (RMCE), thus it was flanked by FRT sites.
BBa_K2605003 - A2UCOE
A methylation-free CpG island that provides stable and localization of                 integration-independent transgene expression when fused to a eukaryotic promoter. This part contains a                 5' MfeI restriction site and 3' NsiI restriction site so it can be used within our Multiple-Cloning                 Site flanked by FRT sites (BBa_K2605002).
BBa_K2605004 - Chicken                     beta-globin insulator
DNAse‐I hypersensitive CpG‐rich structure that provides stable and localization                 of integration-independent transgene expression and prevents unrelated enhancer-promoter interactions                 when flanking a transgene. This part contains a 5' BmtI restriction site and 3' BamHI restriction site                 so it can be used within our Multiple-Cloning Site flanked by FRT sites (BBa_K2605002).
BBa_K2605005 - FRT2
A FLP recombinase recognition target (FRT) site.
BBa_K2605006 - Hybrid                     FlpO-beta resolvase
This part represents a plug-and-play construct to implement the FLP-Beta strategy in a eukaryotic chassis. The coding sequence for FLPo must be added to the same vector or co-delivered with a second. This construct is intended to be subcloned into the MCS of a mammalian expression vector, downstream of a strong promoter and upstream of a terminator. To maximize the efficiency of the system, the expression vector should include a secondary resistance marker (not Puromycin) and an origin of replication to maintain a plasmid population within the cell for as long as is required for the integration reaction to proceed to completion.
