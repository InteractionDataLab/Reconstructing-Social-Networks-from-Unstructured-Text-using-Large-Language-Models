            What is Gene Therapy?
        </H1><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 info"><P>
                    The ideal medicine is not a perfect treatment - it is a cure. For the first time, humankind has the tools to correct the
                    genetic causes of disease.
                </P></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 info"><P>
                    Gene therapy gives us the opportunity to add, remove, and change our genes, influencing how protiens are made and better
                    provide care for those who suffer from debilitating diseases.
                </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row info"><P>
                Typically, gene therapy is performed using a virus to introduce the treatment into the body. Viruses are greatly successful
                at penetrating cells, and thus work as an excellent vector for introducing genetic material. Provided that
                the treatment is successful, functioning proteins will be secreted from the repaired cell, as diagrammed
                below.
            </P></DIV><H1>
            How We're Moving Towards a Safer Gene Therapy
        </H1><DIV class="row info"><P>
                While viral vectors have successfully demonstrated the potential of gene therapy, safety concerns, such as the random integration
                of therapeutic DNA, which can lead to cancer and severe immune responses, constrain their use to severe diseases.
                In order for gene therapies to benefit a greater number of people, for a wider range of indications, the
                risks of viral delivery must be overcome.
            </P></DIV><DIV class="row info"><P>
                Targeted integration of DNA in mammalian genomes has been made simple with CRISPR/Cas9. Unfortunately, the insertion of large
                (&gt; 1 kb) DNA inserts has proven too inefficient for therapeutic applications, restricting the use of CRISPR-mediated
                knock-in to relatively small inserts. In light of these constraints, the University of Calgary iGEM team
                has designed a targeted gene integration platform to build a safer gene therapy.
            </P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 info"><P>
                    There are two pillars at the core of our platform. The first consists of a two-phase integration system, based on CRISPR/Cas9
                    and Flp recombinase. By inserting small Flp recombinase target (FRT) sites using CRISPR/Cas9, Flp can
                    be used to integrate large inserts. To minimize the risk of off-target effects, we will target a &quot;genomic
                    safe harbor&quot; where DNA can safely be introduced.
                </P></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 info"><P>
                    Furthermore, we are minimizing off-target integration by employing Cas9 nickase with an ssDNA template. This second pillar
                    leverages regulatory elements (REs) found naturally in the human genome to keep therapeutic DNA active
                    and isolated from its genomic context. In particular, we are using ubiquitously-acting chromatin-opening
                    elements (UCOEs) to maintain internal control of transgene expression, while preventing disruption of
                    the host genome with insulators.

                iGEM, the International Genetically Engineered Machine, is a non-profit organization dedicated to the advancement of synthetic
                biology. Every year, iGEM holds a competition in Boston where over 300 teams from all over the world come
                to compete.

                    This year, team Calgary is competing at the iGEM competition in Boston with our project, Snip, Equip, Flip: Towards a Safer
                    Gene Therapy. In preparation for the competition, the team is completing a number of requirements, which
                    include building software solutions and generating a microfluidic system.
                </P></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 info"><P>
                    The requirements to succeed in the competition include demonstrating that our engineered system works, collaborating with
                    other teams, and considering the social implications of our system (human practices).

                    The team has been reaching out to thought leaders in the community with the goal of mitigating concerns regarding gene therapy.
                    As a relatively new treatment, gene therapy has been met with mixed reactions. Concerns range from the
                    ethics of enhancement to the accessibility of the treatment. The team would like to address two specific
                    concerns: the act of playing god with respect to western religions, and the relationship between gene
                    therapy treatments and traditional First Nations medicine practices.

                    While gene therapy and its applications are the focus of the human practices portion, the team is also working towards improving
                    education in synthetic biology at the high school level. As an emerging science, the team is working
                    to develop lesson plans and curriculum proposals for Alberta education and proposing a heavier focus
                    on synthetic biology for the international baccalaureate (IB) curriculum, which operates all over the

                    As with all new technology there are increased points of risk that need to be addressed. Particularly, the team has taken
                    strides to increase awareness of the safety precautions that should be taken, while also implementing
                    safeguards where possible. Careful consideration of the ethical implications of gene therapy through
                    introspection is being done and extended via discussions with individuals in the realm of bioethics.
                    These accounts inform our work along with meetings with the public, stakeholders and thought leaders.

                    The team is addressing the project in its clinical context. Meetings at Innovate Calgary are useful for consideration of

                    counselors, who are the primary liason between the laboratory, our product, and patients. Collectively
                    these meetings ground our work in reality, and allow us to enage meaningfully with potential stakeholders
