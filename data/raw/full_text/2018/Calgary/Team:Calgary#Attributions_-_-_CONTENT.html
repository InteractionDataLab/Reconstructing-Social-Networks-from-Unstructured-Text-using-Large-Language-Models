For more specific details on what each individual team member worked on this summer, see our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Calgary/Team">Team Members</A> page.</P><P style="text-indent: 0px">Seven different sgRNA candidates were successfully analyzed for CRISPR targeting efficiency, and their relative efficiencies were compared via indel formation rates.</P><P style="text-indent: 0px"> Although the results are preliminary, the presence of a single adhered HEK293T cell in the puromycin-selected plate indicates the possibility of a functional CRISPR/Dual-Recombinase system. This result will require more time and sequencing to conclusively confirm, but we are extremely excited about the potential it holds. </P><P style="text-indent: 0px">Various chromatin modifying elements have been successfully cloned and sequence-confirmed and are ready for testing in eukaryotic cells. These parts, including a multiple cloning site optimized for dual-recombinase purposes, have been submitted to the registry for the convenience of future teams interested in recombinase.</P><P style="text-indent: 0px">The droplet formation module of our two-step microfluidics system has been prototyped and is in the testing phase, with plans to prototype the droplet electroporation module soon.
            </P><P style="text-indent: 0px">Furthermore, our Software Aggregating Research Assistant (SARA) is complete and functional, and available online for the use of future teams. This software will benefit future teams by compiling useful iGEM software for their own purposes.
            </P><P style="text-indent: 0px">None of these accomplishments would have been possible without the advice and support of our mentors who have led us along this journey.
