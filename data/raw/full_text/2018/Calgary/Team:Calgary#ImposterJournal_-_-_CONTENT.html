                              Week 1.
                              
                                We started off our first week by performing a literature review on the key mechanisms of our section 
                              of the project, including the CRISPR-Cas9 wild type and Cas9 nickase mechanisms, as well as the FLP 
                              protein mechanism. Our literature search led us to design three plasmids to test the three main components 
                              of our subgroup project: ssDNA efficiency, FRT sequence insertion via Cas9n, and FLP recombinase efficiency. 
                              We decided that due to ease of access and high recombination frequency, wild-type CRISPR-Cas9 would be used 
                              in our initial ssDNA efficiency test, however due to its increased specificity largely aligning with our 
                              project's vision of safety, we decided to use Cas9n for the remainder of our project. 
                              
                              As the week progressed
                              we continued to work out the foreseeable problems in our project and began to compile a list of faculty 
                              advisors whom we could contact for advice in shaping our project design. Throughout this planning process, 
                              we engaged in continuous discussion with the UCOE bros subgroup, to allow for our project design to be 
                              compatible and for our work to be done in parallel. Additionally, we attended the Laboratory Safety Training 
                              course held by the University of Calgary to prepare for our work in the laboratory.  
                            
                          	Week 2.
                            
                              This week we began meeting with faculty members and graduate students near our facility to discuss potential 
                              difficulties in our project. We met with a grad student to discuss our current project design 
                              and decided to make some changes, most notably by replacing our CRISPR-Cas9n plasmid with ribonucleoproteins, 
                              which is known to increase recombination efficiency. By running a cost analysis, we were able to determine that 
                              RNPs are more beneficial to our project. Additionally, we were able to lay out an updated timeline of our 
                              project, including our main focus of verification and various side projects such as FLPo vs FLPe 
                              characterization, circular vs linear plasmid use for cas9 insertion efficiency, and the use of a RNP-aptamer-ssDNA
                              complex in facilitating cas9 activity.  In our spare time, our team was able to begin our human practices work by 
                              beginning our preliminary research in building a curriculum change proposal to the International Baccalaureate 
                              Organization.  
                            
                              Week 3.
                            
                              This week we focused on consulting faculty members in order to finalize our project design. 
                              We spoke to professors Wendy Anne Hutchins and Jonathon Lytton, who helped us troubleshoot our project. We also 
                              attended a &quot;Methods Day&quot; workshop hosted by the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, through which 
                              we were connected to some contacts who work with CRISPR as well as HEK cells. Meetings were set up with Iman Al 
                              Khatib, Justin Simms, and Tian Zhao, all graduate students at the University of Calgary working on similar 
                              projects. As the week progressed, we began putting together our plasmids on Benchling and communicating with the
                              UCOE sub group to ensure that our parts are compatible.  
                            
							  Week 4.
                            
                              The focus of this week was a project presentation we held for our faculty mentors and graduate students whom we 
                              would like to engage with for the duration of the project. We were also able to have a meeting with the IB 
                              coordinator and IB Biology teacher from Father Lacombe High School, to further our process of building an option 
                              module focusing on synthetic biology, bioethics and its applications for the upcoming 2022 IB Biology curriculum 
                              change.  
                            
                              Week 5.
                            
                              This week saw the management, finalization, and ordering of various parts through IDT, Genscript 
                              and Addgene. In addition, laboratory work started via practice in transformations, overnights, 
                              minipreps and digest confirmations using registry parts that had potential for usefulness. PAH has importance in 
                              its mutation causing PKU, the AID gene has an enhanced GFP tag that could be used for reporting with cas9, and we 
                              will be using a CMV promoter for transient expression of our parts. The genscript and promega funding applications 
                              were written and submitted.

                            Week 1.
                              
                              We began an extensive literature search on the topic of insulators and other epigenetic regulatory elements, such 
                              as scaffolding/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) and ubiquitous chromatin remodeling elements (UCOEs). We 
                              determined that UCOEs will be most effective at opening chromatin and will be very useful in producing continuous 
                              high-level transcription of any transgenes that are inserted into the human cell genome via our CRISPR/FLP system. 
                              While UCOEs will allow for our gene to enter an active transcriptional state, insulators will function to maintain 
                              this state. If flanking the transgene, insulators protect the gene from the spread of neighboring heterochromatic 
                              regions and from interaction with nearby enhancers [Loss of transcriptional activity of a transgene is accompanied 
                              by DNA methylation and histone deacetylation and is prevented by insulators]. In addition, we began a discussion 
                              about the testing platform that we will utilize. Working in parallel with the CRISPR subgroup prevents us from using 
                              their integration scheme, so we are investigating other options for preliminary experiments. We also completed all 
                              necessary Lab Safety training which will allow us to work in the lab this summer.  
                          	
                            Week 2.
                            
                              We continued with extensive literature research specifically focused on ubiquitous chromatin remodeling elements 
                              (UCOEs) as well as insulators. The A2UCOE, CBX3-UCOE, and cSH4 insulator were selected for experimentation and 
                              their sequences were obtained. We began planning constructs which will eventually constitute the various 
                              cassettes during recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) procedures. We continued the investigation of 
                              other options for preliminary experiments that will free us from dependence on the CRISPR subgroup's FRT 
                              integration scheme. One promising approach would be to generate minicircles from triple-FRT containing FLP 
                              plasmids within prokaryotic cells, isolate and purify the minicircles, and co-transfect them with plasmids 
                              expressing FlpO (pCAG-FLPo) into a HEK cell line that already contain one FRT site (such as Flp-In™ T-REx™ 293 
                              cells). This would allow for the insertion of a second heterospecific FRT site, which makes RMCE possible. 
                              Therefore, we could conduct our experiments on UCOEs and insulators while the CRISPR subgroup fine-tunes the 
                              CRISPR-mediated FRT integration scheme. We began a discussion about the process of obtaining the Flp-In™ T-REx™ 
                              293 cells from internal contacts within the University of Calgary. Another promising possibility explored is to 
                              obtain a cell line that already contains heterospecific FRT sites, such as that described in Callesen et al.'s 
                              RMCE-in procedure [Recombinase-Mediated Cassette Exchange (RMCE)-in Reporter Cell Lines as an Alternative to the 
                              Flp-in System]. In this case, we could begin immediately with RMCE in order to investigate UCOE and insulator 
                              function. We contacted the principle investigator from that research group in regards to obtaining cells from the 
                              generated cell line and are awaiting a response. 
                            
							Week 3.
                            
                              This week, we finalized our BioBrick plans including the restriction sites to be used. Further research on the
                              characteristics of these restriction sites was also conducted. After meeting with Dr. Ray Wang, we secured access 
                              to the  Flp-In™ T-REx™ 293 cell line as well as the commercial vectors pcDNA5 and pOG44 designed for use in the 
                              system. Dr. Ray Wang also offered to provide troubleshooting assistance to the team when using this system. 
                              We practiced laboratory techniques by transforming chemically competent DH5-alpha cells with parts BBa_I712004 
                              (CMV promoter), BBa_K1150012 (BGH terminator),  and BBa_K143064 (chloramphenicol resistance). The University of 
                              Calgary also hosted a methods day, where we were able to attend presentations and speak to other researchers 
                              regarding certain laboratory techniques and protocols. In particular, we were able to learn more about bisulfite 
                              sequencing, transfection techniques, and qPCR primer design. We also attended a welcome event for summer students 
                              as a team, where we went bowling as a team building activity. Finally, we helped to prepare slides and script for 
                              a presentation that will be given to mentors, industry professionals, and other interested general public 
                              attendees on May 23rd. 
                            
                            Week 4.
                            
                              This week,  we continued working on cells transformed with parts BBa_I712004 (CMV promoter), BBa_K1150012 (BGH terminator),  
                              and BBa_K143064 (chloramphenicol resistance) for practice, including creating overnights, mini-prepping, running a 
                              digest, and a digest confirmation. In addition, we created approximately 70 aliquots of chemically competent 
                              DH5-alpha cells for later use. We transformed the parts required for Interlab into our chemically competent 
                              DH5-alpha cells and left them to grow over the weekend. Growth was slow, therefore we will re-transform the 
                              Interlab parts next week with an improved transformation protocol that will hopefully results in a normal growth 
                              rate.
                              
							We finalized the restriction sites that will be used in collaboration with the CRISPR subgroup to ensure that all 
                              parts are compatible and that we are ordering sequences in the most efficient way possible. Parts (BBa_I1466, 
                              BBa_K316003, and BBa_K316027) have been transformed that will be used to test the function of restriction enzymes
                              that have been in our freezer for some time. In addition to participating in the Innovate Calgary workshop, we 
                              also contributed to a team presentation in which we revealed our project idea and experimental plan to faculty 
                              experts, mentors, and members of the public. This event was very useful as we were able to identify some strengths 
                              and weaknesses of the project and plan as well as other general feedback from the audience.  
                            
                            Week 5.
                            
                              We received very generous samples of T-Rex Flp-In HEK293 cells and pcDNA5 and pOG44 vectors from Dr. Ray Wang, a 
                              researcher in Dr. Wayne Chen's lab here at the University of Calgary! The cells were stored at -80C while the 
                              pcDNA5 and pOG44 vectors were transformed into chemically competent DH5-alpha. We miniprepped several samples 
                              of pcDNA5 and pOG44 from the cells and have stored them at -20C for use later in the summer. We also made glycerol
                              stocks of both vectors for long-term storage.  
                              
							  This week we also completed testing with BamHI, AflII and SalI. Despite how old those enzymes are, all three are 
                              functional and were able to successfully digest the test parts (BBa_I1466, BBa_I742107, and BBa_K316003). This 
                              means that we will be able to use these restriction enzymes for cloning later in the summer and that will save us 
                              money! 
                              
							  We re-transformed all of the Interlab test parts in chemically competent  DH5-alpha. During the transformation we 
                              used a lower volume of recovery media (250 uL instead of 2 mL) and we lengthened the recovery period to 1.5 hours 
                              instead of 1 hour. All of the transformations grew  much quicker than last week, therefore we will use the new, 
                              faster-growing parts for the remainder of the Interlab study.  
                              
							  Addgene was offering the synthesis of 2kb gene fragments. We took full advantage of this offer and ordered a few 
                              of our constructs: mCherry-BGH, which will be ligated to CMV(BBa_K747096) from the distribution kit, and both CHS4 
                              parts. Before CMV is ligated to mCherry-BGH we will use overhang PCR to add a SalI restriction site upstream of the
