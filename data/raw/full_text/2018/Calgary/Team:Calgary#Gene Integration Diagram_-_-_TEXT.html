GENE INTEGRATION DIAGRAM
CRISPR/Cas9 wild-type binds targeted DNA location on the genome according to sgRNA homology
Cas9 wild-type cuts DNA in a double stranded fashion
The ssDNA insert brought in along with the RNP CRISPR complex is integrated into the genome
This integration happens via the non-homologous end joining DNA repair mechanism
This “landing pad” containing the FRT site is recognized by FlpO, which recombines with the                         FRT site present on the plasmid, thus bringing in the entire plasmid into the genome
The plasmid contains an inactive puromycin gene as the cargo, this is the case in our                             assays, for use as a proof of concept
Within the genome, two sets of the Six 1, NPS, Six 2 combination are recognized by beta                       resolvase, excising the sequences in-between
Result: Desired Product contains the puromycin gene, which is now active. The                         circularised/excised DNA is discarded, unable to return to the genome.
