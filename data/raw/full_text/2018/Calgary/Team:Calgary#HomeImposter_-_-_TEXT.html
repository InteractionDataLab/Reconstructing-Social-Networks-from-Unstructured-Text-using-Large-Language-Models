The ideal medicine is not a perfect treatment . . .
. . . it's a cure
Advancements in genetic modification have opened avenues                     towards numerous tracks of scientific                     development.
In particular,                     the demand for permanent health solutions has sparked massive interest in gene                         therapy.
Despite the potential for establishing an ideal medicine,                     there are still numerous challenges.
The selection of an integration                         target site,                     methodology pertaining to gene                         delivery, and maintenance of gene expression                     currently limit the potential for gene                     therapy                     to become common practice.
How do we overcome these problems?
SNIP EQUIP FLIP
The system that allows for the integration and                     maintenance of large-scale genetic constructs in eukaryotic systems.
University of Calgaryâ€™s Snip, Equip, Flip aims to overcome                 the aforementioned obstacles. This system                 allows for the creation of eukaryotic cell lines via stable integration and expression of exogenous                 genes.
Snip, Equip, Flip is a simple and reliable method that can                 be used by experienced and entrant                 researchers alike that can lead to a vast array of scientific discoveries.
By complementing the specificity of targeting that                 CRISPR/Cas9 offers with the much larger integration                 capabilities of FLP recombinase and beta resolvase, gene integration into eukaryotic genomes becomes a                 simple process of Snip, Equip, Flip.
The expression of integrated genes is then protected and                 maintained over time by adding flanking                 chromatin modifying elements.
