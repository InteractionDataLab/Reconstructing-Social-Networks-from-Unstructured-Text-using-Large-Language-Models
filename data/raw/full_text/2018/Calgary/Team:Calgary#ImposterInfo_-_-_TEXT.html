Rainer Lim
As a key player in the dry lab software group, Rainer designed the GUI and scraping                                 algorithm for SARA, and graphics for the wiki and the presentation. He is a third year                                 software engineering major and enjoys long walks on the beach (pending sand                                 temperature). He once ate the chocolate off of a CÉLÉBRATIONS™ cookie and tried to pin                                 the crime on a research assistant.
Sarah Walker
Sarah is a third year student studying computer science. She provided the text                                 summarization algorithm and fine-tuned the scraper for SARA as a member of the dry lab                                 software group. In August, Sarah ate some questionable cheese and disappeared for two                                 weeks. She also keeps her love of discotheque a closely guarded secret.
Erika Fung
Erika is a third year Bioinformatics student and a member of the dry lab software group.                                 She assisted with developing functionality for SARA and coding the team’s wiki. Erika                                 managed to get hit in the face with a basketball twice in July, establishing a new low                                 in her life. In billiards, she has impeccable technique and always plays by the rules.

THE SUPERVISORS
Dr. Mayi Arcellana-Panlilio
Dr. Mayi is a Senior Instructor in the Cumming School of Medicine and has mentored University of Calgary iGEM teams since 2011. She firmly believes in the iGEM project being the students’ work from ideation and development to execution and dissemination. However, she also believes in being there for her students, as listener, adviser, sense-maker. Everyone knows she’s a real taskmaster.
Dr. L-V
Dr. L-V is a Senior Instructor in the Department of Biological Sciences and has been involved in a support capacity (basic biochemistry advice) with iGEM teams for the past 3 years. It has been exciting to watch the the iGEM teams struggle a bit in the beginning and emerge victorious usually 24 hours before Wiki-freeze.  Dr. L-V “only” comes for the chocolate cookies available during weekly iGEM meetings.
