PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT: IB CURRICULUM
IB Synthetic Biology and Research Applications
This lesson plan includes five units - four for standard-level IB students and one for higher-level IB students. Although this curriculum plan provides only an outline of the topics which should be covered in class, it showcases a variety of topics pertinent to synthetic biology right now and serves as a great framework to build upon.
Unit 1: Synthetic Biology - An Overview
What is Synthetic Biology?
Creating gene circuits/pathways and analyzing their parts
Interdisciplinary approach to synthetic biology: bioinformatics, software, and engineering
Importance of Public outreach and communication
Future applications of biology and biotechnology
Unit 2: Bioethics and Research
What is bioethics?
Ethical restrictions on research
Ethics analysis and assessment
Biosafety and Biosecurity - the control of biological material
Case Studies on past ethical problems
Unit 3: Medical Applications
Biomarkers: production, recognition, and utilization
Reporters: Genes, aptamers
Detection of pathogens and mutants
Gene therapy: insertions/deletions, insulators, enhancers
Stem cells and gene engineering
Engineering the microbiome: prokaryotic medicine
Unit 4: Building a Better World
Food and Nutrition: cryoprotection, nutrient production
Environment: Crop yield and ecosystem health
Biosensors and bioremediation
Electricity production
Space tools, carbon utilization, and synthetic tissues
Unit 5: Biological tools and techniques
CRISPR: origin, applications, modifications
PCRs, gels, and blots
Bacterial growth and manipulation
Genome sequencing
NCBI and other research databases
Protein analysis
Sequence analysis
