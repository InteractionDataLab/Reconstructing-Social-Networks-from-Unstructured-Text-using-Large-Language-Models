Thanks and Acknowledgement
As a high school team, our members knew little about experimental operations, design and program software, and presentation skills at first. Thanks for our strong coach team, our integrated ability of doing experiments and designing was improved evidently and we could finally stand confidently on the stage to give our presentation.
