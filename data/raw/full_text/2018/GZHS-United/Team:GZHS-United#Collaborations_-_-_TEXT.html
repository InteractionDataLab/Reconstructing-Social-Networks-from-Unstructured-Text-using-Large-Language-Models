GDSYZX
At the very beginning of the summer vocation, we received our experimental skills training courses together with team GDSYZX. After the courses, we still had frequent communication with each other.
Our team helped them amplify their PCS1 and HMA2 plasmids, which they used in their project about solving the contamination of heavy metal. They also helped us transfer plasmids p7NS1-GFP into E.coli Dh5αfor the amplification of the plasmids.
In September and October, we presented our project to each other, we give comments on each others’ PPT. For instance, our team pointed out that their ppt should be more succinct. And we also learn from their ppt that it is a good idea to use the animation effect to illustrate some actions in our project design. We also helped each other team to prepare for the presentation by asking questions. We found it useful because viewing our project from another prospective would usually remind us of some issues that we don’t pay much attention to. For example, their questions about the safety issue of our product actually pushed us to do more research and add some new information into our presentation
SCAU-China
We had long-term collaboration with team SCAU-China.
As a high school team, we lacked some of the experimental equipment necessary to complete interlab, and SCAU-China accidentally damaged their Silica Beads, we have an opportunity to establish a good interaction with the undergraduate team SCAU-China.We provided Silica Beads to SCAU-China and they loaned us their microplate reader and helped us to use it. With the help of each other, we finally successfully completed the interlab measurement task.
Based on friendly relations, this summer, SCAU-China  offered us a 7-day-crouse about the basic skill of art design, which helps us to finish our wiki and poster.
What’s more, we also  regularly hold meetings to exchange information on the project and they gave us some advice which advance the progress of our project. For example, we tried several methods to extract the genome of Bt.i such as high temperature and ultrasonic, but we failed. They suggested us to extract the genome by SDS-phenol-chloroform and we finally succeeded.
In this year's competition, invited by our PI professor Jing Honglei, Chang Yanqi, the current member and Li Siqi, the former member of SYSU-CHINA, became our mentor. They guided us in literature reading and experiment design, and provided us with training in experimental skills on weekends and holidays.
SYSU-CHINA(2018) is an undergraduate team from Sun Yat-sen University. Our high school has been cooperating with their university in students’ education for years, and many members of their former team have graduated from our high school. In addition, they were very generous in providing us with the reagents needed to build the biobricks, and their team member Tao Kehan provided detailed instructions for our experiments in building the part BBa_K2840000.
