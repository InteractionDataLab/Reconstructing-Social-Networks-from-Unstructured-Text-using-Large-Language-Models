We examined a total of 21 possible breeding places, among which we found 9 places with mosquito larvae. In the table, the positive samples represent places that contain mosquito larvae. 
 </P><P>Among all types of breeding places that we found, we discovered that abandoned tyres, flowerpots, and outdoor drains are popular places for female mosquitoes to lay eggs.</P><P>After the field trip, we are astonished that even living in residences in the prosperous area which is away from mountains and wet farmlands, people are threatened severely by mosquitoes. Therefore, to improve public health degree, methods of killing mosquitoes should be advanced.</P><P>We visited the laboratory of a pharmacy enterprise in Zhuhai, Guangdong. We felt lucky to learn about the usages and principles of various kinds of equipment before we start our project in our lab. It’s like a tutorial for us to learn more about labs and safety manipulation. We also have a general understanding about how biology engineer and synthesis related to pharmacy and our daily life. </P><P>From this tour, we gained a basic idea about how a biological laboratory will be like. This indeed improved our work efficiency in the lab. More importantly, we saw how scientists standardized and industrialized their research findings and finally connected them to our daily. That enlightened us on our possible entrepreneurship program. </P><P>This survey conducted by our group is aimed to see people’s opinion about common-used mosquito-killing product, including their preference and concern about health issue related to the products. It’s helpful for us to design our mosquito-killing method based on the public expectation. We are creating a new biological mosquito killer that is both effective and environmentally friendly.</P><P>1. What’s your opinion about anti-mosquito products that you usually use? </P><P>55% of them informed that their anti-mosquito products cannot effectively prevent mosquitos, and 31% said the effective time of preventing mosquito is too short. 29% of them said the products themselves have a strong odor. We integrate people’s opinions into our experiment design and hope to design an anti-mosquito products that are more effective and with less oder.  </P><P>2. Do you pay attention to the chemical components in your anti-mosquito product when choosing them ? </P><P>Nearly third fourths of the investigated body said they do care about the chemical components in their daily-used anti mosquito product. </P><P>3. Which aspect do you mostly care about while choosing anti-mosquito products? </P><P>The data has shown that the effectiveness of preventing mosquito is the most important factor when 
people select anti-mosquito products. The influence to environment and body health is also a frequent consideration among people. </P><P>4. Do you support the idea of putting mosquito-killing fungus and bacteria into mosquito breeding grounds to kill their larvae? </P><P>This questionnaire is designed to investigate the public’s opinions of bio insecticides and to predict how will people react to our product. We found that people generally agree with the idea of killing mosquito in a biological way. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
