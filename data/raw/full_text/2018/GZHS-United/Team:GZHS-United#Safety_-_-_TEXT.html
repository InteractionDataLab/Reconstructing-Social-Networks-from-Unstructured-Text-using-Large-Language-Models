Safe Project Design
1.Proteins: Cry11Aa proteins are specifically toxic to mosquito larvae, harming neither plants nor mammals.
2.Virus: BmK IT targets insects only and does little or no harm to mammals. MDV has a narrow range of hosts; it can merely infect mosquitoes. AeDNV that was used in our experiments mainly infect Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.
3.Bio chassis: E.coli, the most commonly used bio chassis in genetic engineering, is non-pathogenic.
4.Resistance and environmental protection: Chemical pesticides easily develop resistance among mosquitoes and contaminate the environment. Bio pesticides impose a lower selective pressure in mosquitoes, so mosquitoes are less likely to develop resistance. Furthermore, bio pesticides seldom damage soil and pollute water, they are therefore more environmental friendly.
Safe Lab Work
Before experiments started, Mr.Zhang gave us a lecture of safety in the lab. He taught us to operate equipment correctly and established the following rules:
1.Wear lab-gown and rubber gloves during all experiments.
2.Drinking and eating are prohibited.
3.Lids of containers storing chemicals and solutions should be closed as soon as we finish using them.
4.Before leaving the lab, materials should be put in order, water, electricity, and air conditioners should be turned off, and doors and windows should be locked.
5.The lab should be cleaned up everyday, and the clean bench should be sanitized using UV.
6.The biological materials we used in the experiments, including bacteria and larvae, must be microwaved to death before being poured into the sewer.
7.Keep and use all lab materials in the lab only.
8.Contaminated wastes are disposed safely under local regulations.
