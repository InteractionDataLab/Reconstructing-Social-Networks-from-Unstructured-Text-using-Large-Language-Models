Calibration
Calibration 1: Find OD600 reference point using LUDOX and ddH2O.
Calibration 2: Create a particle standard curve using microsphere stock solution.
Calibration 3: Create a fluorescence standard curve using fluorescein.
Cell measurment
1. Transform the 8 plasmids (Positive & Negative Control, Test Devices 1-6) into E.coli DH5α.
2. Pick colonies and inoculate LB medium + Chloramphenicol. Grow the cells overnight.
3. Dilute each overnight culture in LB+Chloramphenicol and measure Abs600 of these diluted cultures
4. Dilute the cultures further to a target Abs600 of 0.02 in a final volume of 12 ml LB medium + Chloramphenicol.
5. Take 500 µL samples of the diluted cultures at 0 hours and measure each samples’ Abs600 and fluorescence measurement.
6. Incubate the remainder of the cultures at 37°C and 220 rpm for 6 hours.
7. Measure each samples’ Abs600 and fluorescence measurement at 6 hours.
8. Find the colony forming units per 0.1 OD600 E. coli cultures.
