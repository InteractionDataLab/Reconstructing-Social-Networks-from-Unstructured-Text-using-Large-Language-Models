The first step of experiments of protein section was to extract the genome of bacillus thuringiensis. Israelensis. Lane 1 and lane 2 were both the genome of Bt.i, and the gel showed that the length of the genome was correct.
After gene segment of Cry11Aa was linked to pEASY-Blunt E1, we checked whether the plasmid was constructed correctly. The gel showed that the length of the plasmid was correct, and the sequencing results showed that the gene segment was successfully linked to the expression vector.
The plasmid was transformed into E.coli and cultured for 4-24 hours. Our targeted protein was expressed successfully based on the picture of gel.
For the virus experiments, we first inserted BmK IT into the plasmid p7NS1-GFP and constructed p7NS1-BIT-GFP. The sequencing results showed that the gene was correctly inserted into the plasmid.  Then, we cultured C6/36 cells to do the cotransfection experiment, but we failed.
