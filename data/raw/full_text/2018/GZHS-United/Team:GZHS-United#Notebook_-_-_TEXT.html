we released our online survey
July 15th
We started courses about lab-safety.
July 16th
we visited a large biological company in Zhuhai, Guangdong, China.
July 17th
we held a lecture in a residential community in Zhuhai.
July 22th
we started our experiment.
July 23rd -August 11th
We transformed our plasmids pUCA and NS1-GFP into DH5α.
We tried to extract the genome of Bti for 12 times but all failed.
We tried to extract our plasmids from DH5αfor 11 times but all failed.
August 12th- 18th
We successfully extracted the genome of Bti  !!!!!!!!
We got our target gene Cry11Aa from the genome using PCR.
We finally extracted our plasmids pUCA and NS1-GFP from Dh5α.
August 29th
We held a lecture in another service center for elders.
September
We constructed all the expression plasmids started collecting the results.
October
We finished our experiment and modeling
