Team UFlorida would like to thank all of the individuals who provided guidance, funding, and encouragement to pursue this project. All of the work on this wiki and in the lab was done by the team members. Students were given experimental advice and guidance throughout the competition cycle, but all lab protocols and gene system designs (SnapGene, Benchling, sequence optimizations, transformations, deletion and assembly methods) were performed by team members.
Mentors
Reisch Lab
Dr. Chris Reisch
Assistant Professor, Microbiology and Cell Science
We would like to thank Dr. Reisch for providing fantastic mentorship, which strongly aided in our gene deletion methodology and synthetic biology design. David, Adam, Lidi, and Lorraine significantly helped by training members on certain techniques in lab and allowing the team to share the lab space. The team gives them sincere appreciation for allowing us to work on the majority of our experiments in their lab.
Dr. Reisch teaches a synthetic biology course at the University of Florida (course code: MCB4934), which two of our team members have completed. This was beneficial in our team's understanding of the field of synthetic biology and various commonly-used techniques.
Lidimarie Rodriguez, PhD candidate
Adam Ellington, PhD candidate
David Gonzalez, Masters student
Lorraine Yomano, Senior Chemist
Dr. K. T. Shanmugam
Professor at the Microbiology and Cell Science Department at the University of Florida
We would like to thank Dr. Shanmugam for providing us outstanding mentorship.  Beyond access to his lab, HPLC, and fermentation supplies, he went above and beyond by training several students in fermentation and providing excellent theoretical guidance to all of us in designing and implementing our project.
Dr. Amor Menezes
Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of Florida
We would like to thank Dr. Menezes for his valuable assistance in mathematical modelling and human outreach brainstorming, and for allowing us to give a presentation to his class lecture.
Dr. Roy Curtiss III
Professor; Department of Infectious Diseases & Immunology
We would like to thank Dr. Curtiss for sending us a culture of the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917. Our project would not have been possible or had significant experimental impact without his important contribution.
Dr. Ellen Zimmerman
We would like to thank Dr. Zimmerman for her expertise of gut disease and insight into the response from patients. She inspired us to remodel our project design and engineer a wider range of probiotic abilities into our bacteria.
Professor Robert W. Emerson
J.D., Huber Hurst Professor of Business Law at the University of Florida
We would like to thank Professor Emerson for his legal and entrepreneurial advice. His assistance allowed us to navigate the intricacies of patent law and create several reasonable business plans.
Dr. Silvia Turroni
We would like to thank Dr. Silvia for allowing us to generate a more well-rounded human practices component of our project. Her responses to our inquiries were very helpful and informed us of what we should research further in the future.
Mady Thompson
Masters student, University of Calgary
We would like to thank Mady Thompson for providing us with information about the iGEM competition and ideas on improving our project.
Court Rogers
We would like to thank undergraduate Court Rogers with her help in graphic design for the team t-shirt logo.
Wesley Belden
We would like to thank Mr. Belden for his generous donation that allowed us to complete this project.
Donors
Dr. Weihong Tan
Distinguished Professor, V.T. and Louise Jackson Professor of Chemistry at the University of Florida
We would like to thank Dr. Tan for providing funding support for the team.
Dr. Marta Wayne
Professor and Chair, Department of Biology at the University of Florida
We would like to thank Dr. Wayne for her generous contribution and continued support for the team from the start of iGEM at the University of Florida.
Dr. Angela Lindler
Associate Provost for Undergraduate Affairs at the University of Florida
We would like to thank Dr. Lindler for her funding support and encouragement to pursue this project and synthetic biology.
Dr. David Norton
Vice President of Research at the University of Florida
We would like to thank Dr. Norton for his funding support and encouragement to pursue our ideas.
Dr. Mary Jo Koroly
Research Associate Professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Director of the Center for Precollegiate Education and Training at the University of Florida
We would like to thank Dr. Koroly for guiding us in finding various outreach opportunities, including presentations for the Student Science Training Program (SSTP) and Science for Life.
