All of the work on this wiki and in the lab was done by the team members. Students were given experimental advice and guidance throughout the competition cycle, but all lab protocols and gene system designs (SnapGene, Benchling, sequence optimizations, transformations, deletion and assembly methods) were performed by team members. </P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><H2>Mentors</H2></DIV><DIV class="column two_thirds_size"><H3> Reisch Lab</H3><H3>Dr. Chris Reisch</H3><P>Assistant Professor, Microbiology and Cell Science </P><P> We would like to thank Dr. Reisch for providing fantastic mentorship, which strongly aided in our gene deletion methodology and synthetic biology design. David, Adam, Lidi, and Lorraine significantly helped by training members on certain techniques in lab and allowing the team to share the lab space. The team gives them sincere appreciation for allowing us to work on the majority of our experiments in their lab. </P><P>Dr. Reisch teaches a synthetic biology course at the University of Florida (course code: MCB4934), which two of our team members have completed. This was beneficial in our team's understanding of the field of synthetic biology and various commonly-used techniques. </P><P>Lidimarie Rodriguez, PhD candidate</P><P>Adam Ellington, PhD candidate</P><P>David Gonzalez, Masters student</P><P>Lorraine Yomano, Senior Chemist</P></DIV><DIV class="column two_thirds_size"><H3> Dr. K.

</P><P>We would like to thank Dr. Shanmugam for providing us outstanding mentorship.  Beyond access to his lab, HPLC, and fermentation supplies, he went above and beyond by training several students in fermentation and providing excellent theoretical guidance to all of us in designing and implementing our project.  </P></DIV><DIV class="column two_thirds_size"><H3>Dr. Amor Menezes </H3><P>Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of Florida</P><P>
