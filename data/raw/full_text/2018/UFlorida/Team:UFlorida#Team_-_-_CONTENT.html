She is hoping to obtain a masters in genetics and then pursue a career related to genetic counseling, personalized medicine, or pharmaceuticals. In her research outside of iGEM, she is working to characterize the development of the CA1 region of the hippocampus in postnatal rats as they age. This will provide a basis for further research involving learning and memory related to this neuronal region. Outside of the lab, Shelby enjoys rock climbing, going to coffee shops, and gardening.</P></DIV><DIV class="column two_thirds_size"><H3> William Owens </H3><P>Biology, Computer Science (Year 3)</P><P>Will is a third year undergraduate double-majoring in Computer Science and Microbiology. His primary interests are genetic engineering, synthetic biology, and artificial life. He intends to pursue a PhD in genetics. Will is fascinated by the crossovers between computer science and molecular biology. The influential Object-Oriented Paradigm, inspired by the cell, allows programmers to construct elegant and scalable software. By thinking of the cell as an information processor, we can construct genetic circuits and engineer a new generation of technology.</P></DIV><DIV class="column two_thirds_size"><H3> Karthek Ramchander </H3><P>Biology, Health Disparities in Society (Year 4)</P><P>Karthek is a recent graduate of the University of Florida. In May of 2018, he obtained his bachelorâ€™s in Biology and a Health Disparities in Society minor. He aims to be a physician who practices in a medically underserved area (MUA). In his research group, he designs and enacts intervention programs across Gainesville and Jacksonville that improve overall health outcomes in MUAs. He also volunteers at the Equal Access Clinic, which is part of a network of clinics that provide medical services to the uninsured and underinsured. Additionally, he volunteers at Child Life, a volunteering program at UF Shands Hospital that provides solace to children from birth to their adolescent years. In his free time, he likes to play the piano, perform close-up magic tricks, and play chess.</P></DIV><DIV class="column two_thirds_size"><H3> Nikila Ojili </H3><P>Microbiology (Year 3)</P><P>Nikila is a third year undergraduate student aspiring to obtain a PhD.
