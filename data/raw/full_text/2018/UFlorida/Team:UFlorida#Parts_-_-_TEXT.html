Part Table
These are the parts our team has created pages for in the Parts Registry for this competition cycle. We were able to submit only three parts out of the group of parts we initially tried to assemble and the backup parts designed as assembly methods failed to work. The successful RFC10 compliant submissions were BBa_K267000 (RFP-FimH) and BBa_K267001 (Ter w/o a promoter). Another part, BBa_K267004, was also submitted to the registry but we believe this part to not actually be RFC10 compliant after analyzing confusing band size results on a gel after restriction digest.
