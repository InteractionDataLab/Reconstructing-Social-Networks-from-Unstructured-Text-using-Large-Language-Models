Week 1 2.07-6.07
Lab Safety instructions from our Supervisors
Ordering chemicals, further primers and required plasmids
Production of media, buffers and agarose gels
Production of chemically competent E.coli
We have received transformed E.coli with the Golden Gate backbones from our PI.
Plasmid preparation of Golden Gate backbones 1 (BB1 FS1-FS2, BB1 FS2-FS3, BB1 FS3-FS4) and 2 (BB2 FSA-FSB, BB2 FSB-FSC, BB2 FSC-FSD, BB2 FSD-FSE)
Unfortunately, restriction analysis did not produce a good result because alkaline lysis did not work as intended. The samples have a very low concentration and are heavily contaminated.
Week 1 2.07-6.07
That week was packed with work. Doris and Theresa started InterLab study and had some difficulties, because they took a 50µl instead of 500µL sample at timepoint zero. Two days later they were able to repeat the experiment and succeeded.
Renewed plasmid preparation of Golden Gate backbones 1 (BB1 FS1-FS2, BB1 FS2-FS3, BB1 FS3-FS4) and 2 (BB2 FSA-FSB, BB2 FSB-FSC, BB2 FSC-FSD, BB2 FSD-FSE)

The PCR of Cup and AlcA did not work according to gel electrophoresis, therefore AlcA was tested in several different ways (With Enhancer and bwPrimer, without Enhancer and bW Primer, with Enhancer and bw 35 Primer, without Enhancer and bw 35 Primer).
However, these unfortunately didn’t work either.
Week 3 16.07-20.07
We received our ordered plasmids from iGEM and immediately continued working with them.
PCR of p35S -830 (Anneal Tm = 66 °C), p35S -90 (Anneal Tm = 63 °C)

BB1_FS2_AlcR mut1fw_ AlcR mut1bw_FS3
BB1_FS2_uGFP_FS3
According to restriction analysis the AlcR transformation was a success, but the MRE and GFP transformation has not.                                   On Friday Johannes, Doris, Michaela und Philipp traveled to the European meetup in Munich. They had a lot of fun and could exchange their experiences they had so far with other teams.
Week 4 23.07-27.07
This week we start with the first PCR for our toggle switch and try hard to get the other things going, which haven’t worked yet.
PCR of MRE (Anneal Tm = 72 °C)

We also had synthetic components made for the XVE element, which we got on Monday. So we were able to clone them in BB1 right away.

Week 6 30.07-3.08
Since almost nothing has worked so far, we had a lot of troubleshooting and we came to the conclusion, that we may interchanged the BB1 when purifying it. That's why we used a BB1 from last year's iGEM team for comparison in Golden Gate cloning.                                   Additionally, we started to amplify promoters and terminators for plants (MAS, tNOS, p35S)

Week 8 13.08-17.08
On Monday we held a presentation at a company called BIOMIN, which later became one of our sponsors.                                   Two days later Ulrich visited an apple farmer to discuss our project with him.

Week 9 20.08- 24.08
Due to the fact that the parts MRE, XVE, gTargetOFF-uGFP, gTargetOFF-gRNAON, gTargetON-gRNAOFF, still didn’t work and the sequencing results show that they lost single individual parts, we had another trouble shooting with our PI.
All these parts consist of four or more individual parts. So, we try to fuse 2-3 individual parts before cloning them altogether into the vector.

We got positive sequencing Results for B1_FS1_p35S_FS2.
Week 10 27.08-31.08
Ulrich and Johannes had a meeting with Timo Küntzle, a journalist and organic farmer, to discuss our project with him.
A colleague of our PI, Dominik, showed Ulrich how to make liposomes and Theresa tried to produce guideRNA a second time.
Benedikt ordered new synthetic components for our XVE part, and made a new Golden Gate protocol for it with a three times higher insert concentration.

Week 11 3.09-7.09
We are still trying to fix our problems with the Toggle-Switch parts and the MRE part.
The iGEM Team Marburg sent us their Vibrigens InterLab Meassurement kit.
The sequencing of the WUS terminator showed us that it has several mutations, so we had to strike it of our list.
On Friday Johanna and Theresa transformed pPLV03_A_p35S_uGFP_tNOS_B in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Now, nothing was standing in our way anymore,  to transform the first plants next week.
Transformation of BB3_FSA_GAP_AlcR_RPS25_ AlcA_GFP_rpl2 _FSB into P.pastoris
The new Golden Gate protocol for the XVE elements worked, and we finally got positive sequencing results for BB1_FS2_XVE1-5_FS3 and also for B1_FS1_pUBQ10_FS2.
Week 12 10.09-14.09
Doris and Michaela start the measurement for the Vibrigens InterLab.
Philipp, David and Theresa transformed pPLV03_A_p35S_uGFP_tNOS_B into Arabidopsis thaliana.
This week we started with the golden gate cloning for the remaining plant parts.
We also designed new primers, developed a new protocol for the Toggle Switch parts (gTargetON-gRNAOFF, gTargetOFF-gRNAON, gTargetOFF-uGFP) and ordered synthetic components as a template for our guide RNAs.
Additional we begun the testing of the ethanol receptor system (BB3_FSA_ GAP_AlcR_RPS25_ AlcA_GFP_rpl2 _FSB) in P.pastoris, but did not get any mentionable results.

Another successful week.
Our Toggle Switch parts (gTargetON-gRNAOFF, gTargetOFF-gRNAON, gTargetOFF-uGFP) were positively sequenced and the production of the guideRNA with the new templates worked well. The red arrows point out the positive colonies, which were sent in for sequencing.
Philipp and Ulrich, produced new Liposomes with a different lipid content and which contained guideRNAON or guideRNAOFF.
Michaela has transformed all parts that have already been sequenced into E.coli and made masterplates and cryostock cultures from them.
This week was the 10. Birthday of the ÖGMBT. In the course of which we were allowed to exhibit our poster. Philipp and Shadan took care of our stand and told us that we got a lot of encouragement of different scientists.

We started our liposome fusion experiment, in which we tested if P.pastoris absorbs liposomes enclosed fluorophore. A colleague of our PI, Thomas, showed Benedikt how to work with the fluorescent microscope.
The iGEM Team Stockholm sent us their parts and we designed and ordered primers for their parts.
Week 13 24.09-28.09
We designed suitable primers for our inserts to ligate them into the pSB1C3 vector. Our inserts had some forbidden restriction sites, so we had to mutate them via PCR.
We had the idea to mutate the vector in a way, that we could use it in a Golden Gate assembling.
Finally, our MRE elements worked and we got positive sequencing results for BB1_FS1_p35S-830_MREx4_p35S-90_FS2. We solved this problem by pre-ligating the individual MRE elements and then cloning them into the backbone.
Doris und Theresa repeated the measuring of the ethanol system in P.pastoris, but some of the shake flasks broke on the shaker, so they were not able to finish their experiment.
For the first time, David was able to catch some good photos on the fluorescent microscope of the Liposome fusion experiment.

Ulrich and Philipp produced liposomes containing fluorophore.
On Friday, we had to move to another laboratory, since the one where were in summer is needed again, so we were very busy tidying up, clearing out and cleaning up.
In that week we were also generating the fragments for our Sweden-collaboration. For this we ran a PCR to obtain Laccase and Mutated Laccase via gel electrophoresis. We also obtained an alpha Leader sequence

Week 14 1.10-5.10
We had big problems with the PCRs for the iGEM parts, and still could not mutate the vector pSB1C3 to use it in Golden Gate cloning.
Theresa tagged the guideRNA with fluorophore, so that we could measure if P.pastoris absorbs the liposomes containing guideRNA.
David and Doris mixed empty liposomes with gRNAON or gRNAOFF and in each case also with the tagged version.

Week 15 8.10-10.10
On monday we changed our strategy so that we can submit at least two parts to the iGEM vector in time for the submission deadline. We digested the vector and the inserts with EcoRI and PstI. Then we ligated them with T4 ligase and transformed them into E.coli so we could do the plasmid preparation on Wednesday to send them in instead of doing it by Golden Gate cloning. (BBa_K2670000 = pSB1C3_p35S-46_LexA, BBa_K2670001= pSB1C3_uGFP)
On Tuesday, Ulrich met Iris Richter, an expert in agricultural law and drones law.
Doris started the ethanol receptor system in P.pastoris a third time and we got pretty good results.
We also started measuring the toggle switch combined with liposome absorption to test if it can switch ON or OFF.
