We have performed several assays to confirm the activity of our glucanase lysing system. We also compared the lytic activity of our glucanase to a commercially available option (Zymolyase). Despite the fact that the Zymolyase performed slightly better than our lysing system, it would not suit for our detection, as it contains RNase and we have decided to utilize gRNA/Cas9 system for DNA detection. That was also a reason why we decided to develop our own glucanase lysing system.
Our glucanase has activity comparable to a 100-1000 fold dilution of Zymolyase (2000 U/Î¼l). Further details on the activity of our glucanase may be found on our Results and Basic Part Page .
