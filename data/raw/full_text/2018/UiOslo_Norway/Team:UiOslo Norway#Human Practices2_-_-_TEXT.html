National Reference Laboratory for Medical Microbiology
After our team found out that we want to do research with fungi, we decided to visit a mycology lab, where we could get information on how to work with fungi. Three of our team members had the unique opportunity to get a guided tour through the National Reference Laboratory for Medical Microbiology at the Oslo University Hospital.
In this Lab, mostly bioengineers or physicians are working with patient samples from various hospitals and medical practices. The facility is divided into two sections, the bacterium and the fungus lab. We were very interested in the fungus lab, since the aim of our iGEM project is to detect Candida albicans. Moreover, the lab is responsible for testing if the patient samples contain microorganisms that are resistant to different types of antimicrobials.
But what did we do at their lab? First, we inspected some fungi from patient probes grown n agar plates (amongst others C. albicans). We tried to valuate with which fungus the patient is most probably infected by dint of tables. Afterwards we got a guided tour into the machinery rooms, where for example the MALDI-TOF instruments are located. This device enables an easy and fast detection of organisms in an unknown sample. As mentioned earlier, a big field of duty of this facility is to detect if various bacterial and fungal strains that are resistant to multiple antimicrobials. We started a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) test of a patient’s sample. This procedure helps to identify the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial needed to prevent visible growth of a bacterium or a fungus. After lunch we did a microscopy session. Lonny (the researcher being responsible for the fungus lab) selected some of the most fascinating fungi and we could have a look at them through the microscope.
At the end of the day we had a conversation with Lonny about our project idea. She thinks that our home detection kit would be very precious in a time where antimicrobial resistance is rising more and more. From her point of view the possibility to buy antimycotics over-the-counter is a big mistake. She underlined the importance of our project in trying to decrease the over-usage of antimycotics. Concluding her attitude towards the over-usage of antimycotics in the field of vaginal fungal infections, we decided to interview more experts in this field of C. albicans infections
All in all this was a very informative and interesting day for us. Thanks to the National Reference Laboratory for Medical Microbiology for giving us an insight into their work.
Motivation from experts
We talked with Physicians, Pharmacists, and consulted with Literature
: “It is estimated that worldwide around 75% of women acquire a Candida albicans (C. albicans) infection at least once, and 40-45% experience two or more episodes.” (Sobel, J.D., Vulvovaginal candidosis. The Lancet, 2007. 369(9577): p. 1961-1971.Hurley, R. and J. de Louvois, Candida vaginitis. Postgraduate Medical Journal, 1979. 55(647): p. 645)
“During a normal work day, I diagnose at least two C. albicans infections.” (Dr. med. Franke, gynecologist, Germany
Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a widespread infection, it is mainly caused by C. albicans. Hence, our team decided to focus on this infection which is a fundamental public health problem .
: “I’m diagnosing C. albicans infections solely through the symptoms of the patient like itching, burning, potentially discharge.” (Möhringer, general practitioner, Germany)
: “After examination of the patient I perform a pap test and grow the sample on Sabouraud Agar.” (PD Dr. Dr. med. Grunewald, dermatologist, Germany)
: “At Sex og Samfunn (sexual health clinic), we would in most cases diagnose C. albicans by looking at the discharge under a microscope and look for fungal hyphae. If we do not observe any fungal hyphae, but the patient experience typical fungal infection symptoms, we recommend her to try an antifungal product to see if it helps. If the symptoms are chronic and she has earlier tried an antifungal product that did not relieve the symptoms, it happens that we take a sample from the patient and grow it for further inspection.” (Sex og Samfunn organization, Norway)
After interviewing 6 physicians with different backgrounds (gynecologists, dermatologists, general practitioner) we observed that doctors have different approaches on how to diagnose a vaginal C. albicans infection.
: "women suffering from a vaginal C. albicans infection must either go to the doctor for diagnosis or self-treat by purchasing antimycotics over the counter without a prescription. Only 30% of all women who self-treat in Norway had an actual C. albicans infection” (http://www.antibiotikaiallmennpraksis.no/index.php?action=showtopic&topic=DrmsfZGV 22.08.2018)
: “I would estimate that about 9/10 times I sell antimycotics against C. albicans infections to women that were not at physician before going to the pharmacy store.” (???, Pharmacist, Norway)
Antimicrobial resistance is a global problem that is constantly increasing and unspecific treatment like buying over-the-counter antimycotics for treating a non-existing C. albicans infection is reinforcing that issue. Our team agreed on an attempt to tackle the high number of misdiagnosis of C. albicans infections.
: “ I don’t know any test for detecting vaginal C. albicans infections. I don’t think pharmacy stores are selling them.” (Aina Kristin Pham, Pharmacist, Norway)
: “I know Canetest. It is a pH dependent test to distinguish between bacterial vaginosis and thrush. But I have never sold one. I think this is due to missing education and advertisement.” (Anita Binder, Pharmacist, Germany)
: “I really like the idea of an easy-to-use test for detecting C. albicans since this would lead to a more targeted and therefore better therapy. But I would like the test to be done at a practitioner, so that in case of a C. albicans infection the physician could prescribe the right antimycotics.” (Alexandra Möhringer, general practitioner, Germany)
: “In my opinion a test would be very meaningful. My personal idea would be that if a person is treated with antibiotics (for example for treating a bladder infection) the test could be sold together with the antibiotics, since the risk is very high that the women will get a fungal infection due to overgrowth of potentially pathogenic organisms.” (Dr. med. Bastian Czogalla, gynecologist, Germany)
The idea of a kit which can be performed at a physician or a pharmacist sounded promising. But what else should the test bring along? In order to request the acceptance of the test, we conducted a questionnaire. The participants were new master students at the Institute for Biosciences at the University of Oslo.
Out of 66 participants, 71% (n=47) were female, while 29% (n=19) were male.The age of the participants ranged from 21 to 43 years, with a mean age of 24 years. More than 75% of the participants were under 26 years old.
Question: If you have the suspicion of suffering from a vaginal C. albicans infection, would you use a “home-testing kit” in order to obtain a more targeted treatment (1 being not likely and 5 being very likely)?
Female participants n = 41 , Male participants n = 15
The answers were as expected very widespread. The reason for that could be, that people are not well informed about vaginal infections, especially with the fungus C. albicans. That’s why we added some general questions about vaginal C. albicans infections to the questionnaire:
Question: Did you know what C. albicans is before the presentation?
Female participants n = 47 , Male participants n = 19
The evaluation shows that more than half of the participants didn’t have prior knowledge of C. albicans, with a higher percentage of men not knowing about C. albicans.
Question: Did you know that C. albicans is a frequent cause of vaginal infections?
Female participants n = 47 , Male participants n = 19
About 2/3 of the participants didn’t know that C. albicans is a causative of vaginal infection.
The evaluation of the questionnaire showed that the participants were not well informed about C. albicans. Thereupon we were wondering if women are educated about the normal vaginal flora and thereby the right hygiene of the genital area.
PHYSICIAN: „I experienced that women are in general poorly educated about commensal microorganisms in the vaginal flora and the knowledge about good hygiene of the genital area is even worse. I could observe that people living in the city are commonly poorly informed whereupon women living on the countryside are even worse educated. In my opinion there is a big need of a campaign that should brief women about these topics.” (Dr. med. Franke, gynecologist, Germany)
PHYSICIAN: “No, I don’t think that women are well informed about these topics. Very often, we as physicians have to educate women about intimate care. In my opinion it would be a good idea to start a campaign for informing women about health of the genital area.” (PD Dr. Dr. med. Susanne Grunewald, dermatologist, Germany)
The outcome of the questionnaire and the interview with different physicians was the crucial factor for us to start the campaign “WHAT'S SOPP”. We established a flyer where women can get informed about the normal vaginal flora, the best hygiene of the genital area and the different symptoms and treatments between bacterial vaginitis and fungal vaginitis.
Interview with experts
With our project we want to approach the problem of misdiagnosis of vulvovaginal C. albicans. A misdiagnosis can often lead to a treatment with the wrong drugs; in this case a treatment with antimycotics even if the patient does not suffer from a fungal infection. Consequently, there is an overuse of antimycotics which results in antimycotic resistance.
Our aim for human practices was to find out if women are educated about commensal microorganisms in the vaginal flora and with that about hygiene of the genital area. We were also curious about the opinion of pharmacists in matters of antimycotics that are sold over-the-counter.
In order to obtain information about these topics, we executed interviews with different experts in the field of fungal infections.

Interview with Dr. med. Katharina Franke, Gynecologist, Germany
How do you diagnose a vulvovaginal C. albicans infection?
The typical clinical symptoms of a vulvovaginal C. albicans infection are redness and a crumbly discharge. After examination of the clinical symptoms I perform a pap test and check the sample under the microscope
Which symptoms lead to a conclusion that the patient is infected with pathogenic C. albicans?
The most common symptoms are the itching and the redness, whereas the itching is the most dominant symptom.
How often do you diagnose a vaginal C. albicans infection in you daily routine as a gynecologist?
During a normal work day, I diagnose at least two C. albicans infections.
Which medication do you prescribe for patients that are infected with C. albicans?
I always prescribe clotrimazole because I have good experiences with this drug.
What do you think about a fast-detection-kit for Candida albicans, that shows a quantitative result of a C. albicans infection?
I like the idea of a fast detection kit. I think that even if the test could be done at home, women with symptoms would still come the practice for being sure that they have a C. albicans infection. But this might only be the case in Germany, since the journey to the next practitioner is short.
Do you think that women are well informed about the commensal microorganisms in the vaginal flora (in matters of bacterial vs. fungal infection)? Are women well informed about hygiene of the genital area and with it a possible prevention of overgrowth of bacteria/fungi through too intense hygiene (washing genital area with a lot of shower gel)?
No. I experienced that women are in general poorly educated about commensal microorganisms in the vaginal flora and the knowledge about good hygiene of the genital area is even worse. I could observe that people living in the city are commonly poorly informed whereupon women living on the countryside are even worse educated. In my opinion there is a big need of a campaign that should brief women about these topics.
Interview with Dr. med. Bastian Czogalla, Gynecologist, Germany
How do you diagnose a vulvovaginal C. albicans infection?
The typical clinical symptoms of a vulvovaginal C. albicans infection are itching and a crumbly discharge. We always do a microscopy test for being sure that the patient is suffering from a C. albicans infection. In special cases we grow the organism on a petri plates.
Which symptoms lead to a conclusion that the patient is infected with pathogenic C. albicans?
The dominating symptoms are itching, as well as burning and white crumbly discharge. Sometimes you can see that the fungus has already attacked the vulva (but this is not frequently seen).
How often do you diagnose a vaginal C. albicans infection in you daily routine as a gynecologist?
We diagnose these infections frequently, especially since I’m responsible for treating pregnant women. Pregnant women are very prone to fungal infections like C. albicans.
Which medication do you prescribe for patients that are infected with C. albicans?
Our experience says that “Canesten Gyn one Kombi” works best.
What do you think about a fast-detection-kit for Candida albicans, that shows a quantitative result of a C. albicans infection?
In my opinion this test would be very meaningful. My personal idea would be that if a person is treated with antibiotics (for example for treating a bladder infection) the test could be sold together with the antibiotics, since the risk is very high that the women will get a fungal infection due to overgrowth of potentially pathogenic organisms.
Do you think that women are well informed about the commensal microorganisms in the vaginal flora (in matters of bacterial vs. fungal infection)? Are women well informed about hygiene of the genital area and with it a possible prevention of overgrowth of bacteria/fungi through too intense hygiene (washing genital area with a lot of shower gel)?
For me this question is hard to answer since we’re not directly talking with the patients about that topic. My personal assessment is that women are poorly informed about vaginal health, especially about the normal vaginal flora. That’s why I think a campaign with the aim of informing women about that would be very meaningful, especially for women who are prone to fungal infections.
Interview with Dr. Dr. med. Susanne Grunewald, Dermatologist, Germany
How do you diagnose a C. albicans infection (both vaginal, oral and diaper dermatitis)?
After examination of the patient I perform a pap test and grow the sample on Sabouraud Agar.
Which symptoms lead to a conclusion that the patient is infected with pathogenic C. albicans?
The typical symptom for a vaginal C. albicans infection is white discharge whereas the typical symptom for an oral C. albicans infection is a white film on the tongue with the ability to scrape it off.
How often do you diagnose a vaginal C. albicans infection in you daily routine as a dermatologist (both vaginal, oral and diaper dermatitis)?
I diagnose a C. albicans infection about 5 times a week.
Which medication do you prescribe for patients that are infected with C. albicans?
For oral mucosa I prescribe nystatin suspension. For the corner of the mouth and the genital region I prescribe nystatin paste. For vaginal infections I prescribe gynopevaryl suppository, which contents Econazol.
What do you think about a fast-detection-kit for C. albicans, that shows a quantitative result of a C. albicans infection?
I think a fast detection kit would be very convenient, but in Germany it is easy to get an appointment at a physician. I like the idea of having this kit at a doctor’s office. In the end I think that patients like the consultancy from a physician. For me as a dermatologist it would be very handy if the test could detect diaper dermatitis, which is also caused by C. albicans.
Do you think that women are well informed about the commensal microorganisms in the vaginal flora (in matters of bacterial vs. fungal infection)? Are women well informed about hygiene of the genital area and with it a possible prevention of overgrowth of bacteria/fungi through too intense hygiene (washing genital area with a lot of shower gel)?
No, I don’t think that women are well informed about these topics. Very often, we as physicians have to educate women about intimate care. In my opinion it would be a good idea to start a campaign for informing women about health of the genital area.
Interview with Alexandra Möhringer, General Practitioner, Germany
How do you diagnose a vulvovaginal C. albicans infection? Which symptoms lead to a conclusion that the patient is infected with pathogenic C. albicans?
I’m diagnosing C. albicans infections solely through the symptoms of the patient like itching, burning, potentially discharge. But we’re not doing swabs.
How often do you diagnose a vaginal C. albicans infection in you daily routine as a gynecologist?
Since I’m a general practitioner I don’t diagnose a C. albicans infection very often, meaning approximately once a month.
Which medication do you prescribe for patients that are infected with C. albicans?
Normally I first prescribe Clotrimazol (Canifug cremolum). When the patient is suffering from recurring infections I prescribe Econazol (for example Gyno-Pevaryl)
What do you think about a fast-detection-kit for Candida albicans, that shows a quantitative result of a C. albicans infection?
I really like the idea of an easy-to-use test for detecting C. albicans since this would lead to a more targeted and therefore better therapy. But I would like the test to be done at a practitioner, so that in case of a C. albicans infection the physician could prescribe the right antimycotics.
Do you think that women are well informed about the commensal microorganisms in the vaginal flora (in matters of bacterial vs. fungal infection)? Are women well informed about hygiene of the genital area and with it a possible prevention of overgrowth of bacteria/fungi through too intense hygiene (washing genital area with a lot of shower gel)?
No, women are mostly very poor educated about the natural vaginal flora. This leads to wrong hygiene (destroying the normal flora by using to much sanitary products) and furthermore to a infection with fungi or bacteria.
Interview with Usha Hartgill, divisional head of Olafiaklinikken, Norway
How do you diagnose a C. albicans infection and which symptoms lead to a conclusion that the patient is infected with pathogenic C. albicans?
Candida albicans can be a normal part of the vaginal flora. In cases where there is overgrowth and the woman experience typical symptoms (increased, “cottage cheese” discharge and itching/soreness genitally), clinical findings of vulvitis and/or vaginitis and candida spores/hyphae are observed on a wet mount prep of vaginal discharge, one can diagnose candida albicans vaginitis requiring treatment.
Which antimycotics that are used for C. albicans infections are only available on prescription, which ones are sold over-the-counter?
Clotrimazole (Diflucan) vaginal pessary and cream is available OTC. The oral form and all other antimycotics require a prescription.
What do you think about the fact, that in Norway many antimycotics are sold over-the-counter (in matters of increase of antimycotic resistance)?
I am only aware of Clotrimazole pessaries and cream and Terbinafine cream being sold OTC. Cream alone is ineffective for the treatment of vaginal candida infection.
Which tests do you know/ do you sell in your pharmacy store for fast detection of vaginal Candida albicans infections?
None.
What do you as an experienced physician think about a fast detection kit for pathogenic Candida albicans infections/overgrowth of Candida albicans that can be executed at home? The test will show a quantitative result, namely if there is an overgrowth of Candida albicans and if yes, how intense the infection is.
In one study, it was shown that only about a third of women who bought OTC candida preps actually had candida and the others had other causes for their symptoms. As candida is a usual part of the vaginal flora and doesn’t cause problems in the majority of cases, a quantitative test may be useful, but it doesn’t always correlate with how symptomatic it is in individuals. I am dubious as to how accurate it will be at identifying the cause of symptoms. One has to be confident at there is no risk of for example sexually transmitted infection, aerobic vaginitis as causes.
Do you experience that women are well informed about the commensal microorganisms in the vaginal flora (in matters of bacterial vs. fungal infection)?
Variable, but generally poor.
Are women well informed about hygiene of the genital area and with it a possible prevention of overgrowth of bacteria/fungi by too intense hygiene (washing genital area with a lot of shower gel)?
Culturally, there is a difference in intimate hygiene practices amongst different groups of women. Douching is common in some groups, use of disinfectants in the bath water in other groups. Many women are influenced by adverts for “specially manufactured intimate hygiene” washes which are often misleading.
Interview with the clinic "Sex og Samfunn”, Norway
How do you diagnose a C. albicans infection (both vaginal, oral and diaper dermatitis)?
At sex and samfunn (sex and society), we would in most cases diagnose C. albicans by looking at the discharge with a microscope and look for fungal hyphae. If we do not observe any fungal hyphae, but the patient experience typical fungal infection symptoms, we recommend her to try an antifungal product to see if it helps. If the symptoms are chronic and she has earlier tried an antifungal product that did not relieve the symptoms, it happens that we take a sample from the patient and grow it for further inspection. This is if the symptoms have lasted over time and we consider recommending a diflucan cure over a longer time period.
Which symptoms lead to a conclusion that the patient is infected with pathogenic C. albicans?
Primarily by looking at fungal hyphae, but also by symptoms as red mucosa, thick and a lumpy discharge and itching. We often observe that many patients suffering from chronic fungal infections can have some atypical symptoms, so we usually do a microscopy observation of the discharge.
How often do you diagnose a vaginal C. albicans infection in you daily routine?
We probably have at least three women at the clinic each night that has a fungal infection, sometimes more.
Which medication do you prescribe for patients that are infected with C. albicans?
When the symptoms are not too bad and it is not chronical, we recommend local treatment with canesten or pevaryl as either cream or pessaries. We give them written information about these and often recommend the version that requires treatment over a couple of days and not a one-time dose with canesten. When the symptoms are worse or when the patient has done several local treatments, we recommend treatment with diflucan 150mg tablets (one-time treatment for one-time occurring infections or long-time treatment for chronic symptoms). We also give information about daktacort cream when the patient experiences a lot of itching.
What do you think about a fast-detection-kit for C. albicans, that shows a quantitative result of a C. albicans infection?
As many women treat themselves too often with antifungal products, this can lead to a problem. It is also observed that women with vestibulitis often over treat with local antimycotics. Many girls use canesten just as an itch reliever without doing the full treatment. A test could be nice if it can be trustworthy, so that many can skip doing a treatment or visit a doctor etc. when the symptoms lasts over a longer period of time. It should also be information about itching and that this symptom can be caused by sexually transmitted diseases or other vaginal problems. In this case they should contact a doctor if the symptoms do not disappear or the test shows a negative result.
Do you think that women are well informed about the commensal microorganisms in the vaginal flora (in matters of bacterial vs. fungal infection)? Are women well informed about hygiene of the genital area and with it a possible prevention of overgrowth of bacteria/fungi through too intense hygiene (washing genital area with a lot of shower gel)?
No, but we experience that over the last year this has improved. More women come to our clinic to test if they have bacterial vaginosis, but many do not understand that women have both a bacterial and fungal normal flora on their body. Many believe that it is contagious and that their partner have to be treated.
Interview with Martin Mueller, Pharmacist, Germany
Which antimycotics are used for treating C. albicans infections?
Most common used antimycotics for C. albicans are:
Local application:  Clotrimazol: Kadefungin, Canesten Gyn, Vagisan Myko, Antifungol  Dequalinium chloride: Flumoizin  Nystatin: Biofanal Kombi, Adiclair  Fenticonazol nitrat: Fenizolan  Hexetidin: Vagi-Hex Fluconazol: Fungata   Miconazol nitrat: Gzno-Mykotral   Econazol nitrat: Gyno-Pevaryl   Ciclopirox olamin: Inimur Myko
Systemic application   Nitrofurantoin: Nifurantin   Itraconazol: Siros, Sempera
Which antimycotics that are used for C. albicans infections are only available on prescription, which ones are sold over-the-counter?
If the antimycotic is only available on prescription is dependent on the active pharmaceutical ingredient and its concentration Clotrimazol (as an exception): dependent on duration of treatment 3 days therapy (for example Kadefungin 3 combination or Canesten Gyn 3 combination over-the-counter available) But 6 days therapy only available on prescription (even if it only contains half of the active pharmaceutical ingredient) All the other ones shown above are available over-the-counter
How often do you sell antimycotics against C. albicans infections to women that were not at a physician before going to the pharmacy store?
About one third of over-the-counter available antimycotics are sold after consultation from a pharmacist
How often do women buy prescription antimycotics for treating C. albicans infections?
Most of the patients bring a “green” prescription. That means they were at a physician and the physician gives them the advice to buy an over-the-counter antimycotic.
What do you think about the fact, that there is an increase of antimycotic resistance?
This is a very critical fact. A test to make the diagnosis better/easier would be a good way to slower the advancement of antimycotic resistance.
Which tests do you know/ do you sell in your pharmacy store for fast detection of vaginal C albicans infections?
I sell Canetest from Bayer. It is a pH dependent test to distinguish between bacterial vaginosis and thrush.
Are these test kits sold often?
No, once every four months.
What do you as an experienced pharmacist think about a fast detection kit for pathogenic Candida albicans infections/overgrowth of Candida albicans that can be executed at home? The test will show a quantitative result, namely if there is an overgrowth of Candida albicans and if yes, how intense the infection is.
This is a question that I have to make dependent on the location of pharmacy store: my store is in a medical center, meaning there are two gynecologists in the same house than my store. As a result, such a rapid test probably does not play a greater role for us than Bayer's existing one. Most women come to us with the medical diagnosis. It may look different in pharmacies without direct proximity to such specialists.
In general, however, I see a rather small need, which is also recognized by the fact that very few manufacturers have approached the topic of rapid test "vaginal mycoses". Purely pharmaceutically - without economic aspect - the development of a test, which also quantitatively makes a statement, sounds quite reasonable. For the patient arises the question: when should I treat myself and at what concentration should she go to a doctor?
Do you experience that women are well informed about the commensal microorganisms in the vaginal flora (in matters of bacterial vs. fungal infection)? Are women well informed about hygiene of the genital area and with it a possible prevention of overgrowth of bacteria/fungi by too intense hygiene (washing genital area with a lot of shower gel)?
• I think that most women know about good hygiene of the genital region. But this is also depending on the fact, that my customers have normally been at the gynecologist where they get informed about the right hygiene before they come to me.
Interview with Anita Binder, Pharmacist, Germany
Which antimycotics are used for treating C. albicans infections and which one are only available on prescription?
OTC: Clotrimazol, Fenticonazolnitrat, Nystatin
Prescription: AmphotericinB, Miconazolnitrat, Econazolnitrat,Ciclopirox-Olamin
How often do you sell antimycotics against C. albicans infections to women that were not at a physician before going to the pharmacy store?
One to two times a week. But I have a small pharmacy store on the countryside, so I don’t have that many clients.
How often do women buy prescription antimycotics for treating C. albicans infections?
I don’t sell antimycotics that are only available on prescription very often; only 2-3 times a year. But keep in mind that I’m located at the countryside where no gynecologist is located.
What do you think about the fact, that there is an increase of antimycotic resistance?
The best-selling candida antifungal in Germany is clotrimazole, I estimate 95%. This is only for sale in pack sizes for the 3-day therapy. Larger packs are subject to prescription. If the infection does not heal after 3 days, women should go to the doctor and have another antifungal prescribed. In my estimation, this happens relatively seldom. Most women (almost all) do not come back after buying the 3-day dose, so I assume they are cured. This means that no resistance has developed yet. In the meantime, the high-dose 1-day therapy (500 mg Clotrimazole) is often recommended (also OTC) to prevent premature termination of therapy and thus reduce the risk of developing resistance.
Which tests do you know/ do you sell in your pharmacy store for fast detection of vaginal C albicans infections?
I know of the Elaneetest and Canetest.
Are these test kits sold often?
No, actually never. I think this is a fact of missing education and advertisement.
What do you as an experienced pharmacist think about a fast detection kit for pathogenic Candida albicans infections/overgrowth of Candida albicans that can be executed at home? The test will show a quantitative result, namely if there is an overgrowth of Candida albicans and if yes, how intense the infection is.
I think a C. albicans fast detection kit which a customer can execute himself makes sense.  Most of the women who buy clotrimazole supplements have recurrent infections and are familiar with the symptoms. A quick test would tell you if it really is a Candida infection. In my opinion is the outcome of a quantitative test too complicated.
Do you experience that women are well informed about the commensal microorganisms in the vaginal flora (in matters of bacterial vs. fungal infection)? Are women well informed about hygiene of the genital area and with it a possible prevention of overgrowth of bacteria/fungi by too intense hygiene (washing genital area with a lot of shower gel)?
This topic is not addressed often addressed in the pharmacy, so this is hard to say. I assume that women with recurring infections are well informed.
Interview with Aina Kristin Pham, Pharmacist, Norway
Which antimycotics are used for treating C. albicans infections and which one are only available on prescription?
Ekonazol (pevaryl®), klotrimazol (for instance canesten®), flukonazol (Diflucan®), nystatin (for instance nystimex®, mycostatin®). There are many other antimycotics which can be used to treat yeast infections, but these are the most common ones when dealing with localized infections.
Which antimycotics that are used for Candida albicans infections are only available on prescription, which ones are sold over-the-counter?
Ekonazol, klotrimazol and flukonazol are available OTC. Flukonazol can also be on prescription. Nystatin is only available through a prescription
How often do you sell antimycotics against C. albicans infections to women that were not at a physician before going to the pharmacy store?
I only sell to customers who have been to their general practitioner or have been diagnosed with C. albicans infections previously and can therefore recognize the symptoms.
How often do women buy prescription antimycotics for treating C. albicans infections?
Seldom. I have had one elderly patient buy flukonazol on prescription (oral tablets, as the OTC one is contraindicated for women above 50 years of age). Younger women tend to buy the vaginal creams and pessaries that are non-prescription. I have also had some patients buy nystatin due to an oral candida infection.
What do you think about the fact, that there is an increase of antimycotic resistance?
Women should refer to their general practitioner for a first-time diagnosis. Since the symptoms are easily recognized, I do not think it is necessary to check with the doctor every single time, though it would probably be handy if there was some kind of device for the patients to test at home to be absolutely sure whether they have a yeast infection or not (of course it depends on the quality of such device). Pharmacists should also be better at informing their customers about the correct use of OTC antimycotics.
Which tests do you know/ do you sell in your pharmacy store for fast detection of vaginal C albicans infections?
I don’t know. I don’t think pharmacy stores are selling them.
Are these test kits sold often?
No.
What do you as an experienced pharmacist think about a fast detection kit for pathogenic Candida albicans infections/overgrowth of Candida albicans that can be executed at home? The test will show a quantitative result, namely if there is an overgrowth of Candida albicans and if yes, how intense the infection is.
That would be great if the kit is reliable. But it might also lead to over-treatment of simple yeast infections, and hence increase antimycotic resistance. It all depends on the sensitivity of these kits
Do you experience that women are well informed about the commensal microorganisms in the vaginal flora (in matters of bacterial vs. fungal infection)? Are women well informed about hygiene of the genital area and with it a possible prevention of overgrowth of bacteria/fungi by too intense hygiene (washing genital area with a lot of shower gel)?
No, from my experience women are not well informed on the subject matter.
