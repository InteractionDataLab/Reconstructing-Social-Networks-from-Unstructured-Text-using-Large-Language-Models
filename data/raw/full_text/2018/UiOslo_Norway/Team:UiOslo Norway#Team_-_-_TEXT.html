Markus Herberg Hovd
Discipline:
Master in Pharmacy
”I joined iGEM because it seemed like a fun challenge, and because I wanted to work with other disciplines. When I joined I knew next to nothing about what synthetic biology has to offer. We have a brilliant team with great people, and I believe we will be able to make something that matters.”
Fun fact:I really can't play the theremin.
Verena Mertes
Discipline:
Master in Molecular Biology
”I joined the iGEM team as I think that it is a great experience to work together with a team on a project from scratch and to hopefully finish this project successful. Furthermore, is it a great opportunity to participate in an international competition and to learn many different skills for my future life.”
Fun fact:I never played Sims2 without using motherlode. (And I am propably not the only one).
Rebekka Rekkedal Rolfsnes

“I totally joined because of my boyfriend (note: Markus), JK. I just love microorganisms and I wanted to work with them. I made new friends and I am learning new stuff every day. Plus, I also have an interest in joining the lab of our supervisor for my master project, yeah I am still just a bachelor student.”
Fun fact:I’m really struggling to get out of Silver V...
Markéta Chlubnová
Discipline:
Master in Molecular Biology
“I joined iGEM because I think it is an excellent opportunity to work independently on a project from the very beginning. In my opinion, iGEM can provide me with a new experience, where I have to solve challenging situations and learn how to effectively manage time. I also hope to meet new interesting people.”
Fun fact:I have an identical evil twin sister.
Yvette Dirven
Discipline:
Master in Molecular Biology
“I joined the iGEM team because I wanted to use my knowledge about biology to develop a product that hopefully will help people, and to be part of a wonderful team of interdisciplinary, young, ambitious scientists. iGEM has been a great experience so far, and we are just getting started!”
Fun fact:I can play four different musical instruments and I have played in a brass band for over 11 years.
Henrik Kvalheim Eriksen
Discipline:
Master in Molecular Biology
“I mainly joined this year’s iGEM team for the hands-on experience in developing a project from scratch with other students which includes everything from planning and dividing tasks, to reaching out to sponsors and get PR. In other words, real world experience. The fun that is attached is only a bonus.”
Fun fact:I used to have really long hair. It looked terrible...
Lisa Fröhlich
Discipline:
Bachelor in Molecular Medicine
“I’m really interested in scientific competitions like iGEM, because you have the unique opportunity to work in a team with other students that share your interests and socialize with people from all over the world.”
