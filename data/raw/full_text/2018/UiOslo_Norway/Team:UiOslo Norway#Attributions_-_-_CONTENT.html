As we are a rather small team, we did not have a strict division of roles and many times we worked all together to accomplish certain parts of our project. </P><H4 id="inspiration">Inspiration</H4><P>Our project was inspired by the works of <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Peking" alt="iGEM Peking 2015">iGEM Peking 2015</A> and <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:UiOslo_Norway">iGEM UiOslo_Norway 2016</A>.
  Our decision to detect vulvovaginal <EM>Candida albicans</EM> stemmed from the public lack of knowledge concerning the subject, and increasing antimycotic resistance.</P><H4>Background</H4><P>At the University of Oslo, iGEM is offered as a two-semester course (course code: <A href="https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ibv/MBV4910IGEM/">MBV4910IGEM</A>) and is evaluated on a pass or fail basis. There are no supporting course materials, for this course as the course consists of a student-driven interdisciplinary project in synthetic biology. The course starts in March and finishes in October after the Giant Jamboree. We started brainstorming in the beginning of March and had a clear project idea at the end of March. In April, we started planning the lab work and experiments. In late June we received all components we had ordered; thus we were able to start working in the lab.</P><P>On this page, we would like to thank everyone who believed in our project and help us in the execution.

Because of this, making a wiki and graphical layout from scratch turned out to be a huge challenge for us.
However, with the many free resources on the world wide web and many, many hours of work, we did it. We are proud of our results, and hope to share them with other iGEM teams. Our code is free to be copied and used for future wikis.</P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="six columns"><P><STRONG>w3schools</STRONG><A href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</A> is a free resource for tutorials and a reference guide for web development.

    Skeleton is an open-source boilerplate written by Dave Gamache. It has helped us maintain the typography and scaling of elements on our website. With only ~400 lines of code, it's light weight makes it perfect for smaller projects like this.
