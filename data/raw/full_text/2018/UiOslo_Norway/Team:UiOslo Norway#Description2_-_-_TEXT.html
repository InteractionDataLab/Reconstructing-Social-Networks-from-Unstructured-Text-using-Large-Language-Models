Project Description
Canditect – Fast detection of Candida albicans infections using CRISPR/Cas9
Current methods for detection of Candida albicans infections in Norway are often unspecific, time consuming, or require trained personnel. As a result, women who suffer from a vaginal infection often purchase over-the-counter antimycotics without knowing the exact cause of their infection. This may contribute to the rise of antimycotic resistance and make future treatment of infections more difficult. Thus, there is a need for a fast, specific and easy to use detection kit; this is what our team aims to develop. Based on previous projects, we will apply the CRISPR/dCas9 system to detect the presence of C. albicans specific DNA sequences in lysed vaginal samples. Two dCas9 proteins will be fused with split β-lactamase, which will act as a reporter. Upon binding to target DNA, the two dCas9 proteins will bring the split β-lactamase in close proximity. This allows the active enzyme to cleave its substrate, producing a colored product. As a larger goal we hope to promote the right use of antimycotics.
