Student members
All student team members performed outstanding work and showed interest and dedication to the project. As we are a rather small team, we did not have a strict division of roles and many times we worked all together to accomplish certain parts of our project.
Inspiration
Our project was inspired by the works of iGEM Peking 2015 and iGEM UiOslo_Norway 2016 .   Our decision to detect vulvovaginal Candida albicans stemmed from the public lack of knowledge concerning the subject, and increasing antimycotic resistance.
Background
At the University of Oslo, iGEM is offered as a two-semester course (course code: MBV4910IGEM ) and is evaluated on a pass or fail basis. There are no supporting course materials, for this course as the course consists of a student-driven interdisciplinary project in synthetic biology. The course starts in March and finishes in October after the Giant Jamboree. We started brainstorming in the beginning of March and had a clear project idea at the end of March. In April, we started planning the lab work and experiments. In late June we received all components we had ordered; thus we were able to start working in the lab.
On this page, we would like to thank everyone who believed in our project and help us in the execution. We could not have come this far without the contribution of the people and companies listed below.

Abigail Sison Was our contact person with iGEM headquarters. Abigail was always available to help us and she also kept us informed about important iGEM deadlines.
Ana Sifuentes When we had trouble with the Wiki, Ana was there to aid us and answer our questions
Other resources
None of our team-members are particularily skilled in either programming or design. Because of this, making a wiki and graphical layout from scratch turned out to be a huge challenge for us. However, with the many free resources on the world wide web and many, many hours of work, we did it. We are proud of our results, and hope to share them with other iGEM teams. Our code is free to be copied and used for future wikis.
w3schools w3schools.com is a free resource for tutorials and a reference guide for web development. We wrote our wiki by ourselves, and this free resource helped us a lot
Skeleton Skeleton is an open-source boilerplate written by Dave Gamache. It has helped us maintain the typography and scaling of elements on our website. With only ~400 lines of code, it's light weight makes it perfect for smaller projects like this.     You can find more information at getskeleton.com
THANK YOU!
