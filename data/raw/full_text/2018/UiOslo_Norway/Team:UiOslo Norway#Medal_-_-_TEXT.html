Integrated Human Practices
Our project has been heavily influenced by our Human Practices.           We interviewed several experts in the field, each of whom provided us with valuable feedback and new perspectives. We also distributed a questionnaire for new masters students.           From the individual components to the overall design, we have taken an extra step to integrate the feedback.
