A detection kit for vulvovaginal Candida albicans
Taking advantage of the inactivated, but highly specific CRISPR/CAS-complex, we are able to bind     selectively to a given DNA-sequence. Coupling this with a split reporter-enzyme which combines on target,     our system gives an easy-to-read colour output!
