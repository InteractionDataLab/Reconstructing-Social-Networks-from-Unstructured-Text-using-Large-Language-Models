After incubation at 37oC overnight we could not observe any colonies. Thus, we performed another competency test following the same protocol. No colonies were observed, again.
Transformation of Interlab test devices
We did a transformation of the Interlab test devices 1-6 plus the positive and negative control according to the transformation protocol. After incubation at 37oC overnight we could not observe any colonies.
Since both the competency test and the two transformations failed, we concluded that our potentially chemically competent cells possibly aren’t working.
Production of chemically competent DH5α cells
We performed the production of chemically competent DH5α cells according to this protocol .
Since the procedure didn’t work we suspected the cell stock we were using was not optimal. We therefore chose to buy new stock of already chemically competent DH5α cells from Thermofisher.
Week 23
Transformation of Interlab test devices
We did a transformation of the Interlab test devices 1-6 plus the positive and negative control with the bought chemically competent DH5α cells according to the transformation protocol. After incubation at 37oC overnight we could not observe any colonies.
We did another transformation according to the same protocol. Again we could not observe any colonies.
Week 24
Transformation of Interlab test devices
We did a transformation of the Interlab test devices 1-6 plus the positive and negative control with the bought chemically competent DH5α cells according to the iGEM transformation protocol. After incubation at 37oC overnight we could not observe any growth.
Week 26
Transformation of Interlab test devices
We did a transformation of the Interlab test devices 1-6 plus the positive and negative control with the bought chemically competent DH5α cells according to the transformation protocol. After incubation at 37oC overnight we could not observe any colonies.
No growth was observed, but the experiment was retried, and we got colonies for each test device and the positive and negative controls. Presumably human error or other factors may have been the cause of this happening.
We decided to contact the iGEM headquarter to see if anyone else had reported problems with the Interlab study, but we discovered that we had used the wrong wells. After acknowledging our errors, we were able to start fresh with the correct wells.
Always double-check your wells!
Week 27
Transformation of Interlab test devices
We did a transformation of the Interlab test devices 1-6 (with the correct wells) plus the positive and negative control with the bought chemically competent DH5α cells according to the transformation protocol. After incubation at 37oC, colonies was observed in all plates.
Week 28
Completed the Interlab study
Colonies on the plates from week 27 was re-streaked onto fresh LB-Chloramphenicol plates and grown for a later Miniprep.
Two colonies from each construct plate was inoculated in a overnight culture for a Miniprep the next day
A Miniprep was done according to protocol of each double test devices and negative and positive controls.
The iGEM protocol “Colony forming units per 0.1 OD600E.coli cultures” was performed, and we got the results which is shown in our Interlab page. Colonies on plates where counted the next day of the experiment.
The iGEM protocol “Cell measurement protocol” was performed, and we got the results which is shown in our Interlab page.
Flowcytometry
With help from Johannes Landskron, a Flowcytometry study was performed on the same cultures from the cell measurement experiment according to the iGEM protocol.
