The Lancet, 2007. 369(9577): p. 1961-1971.Hurley, R. and J. de Louvois, Candida vaginitis. Postgraduate Medical Journal, 1979. 55(647): p. 645)</P><P>: “During a normal work day, I diagnose at least two <EM>C. albicans</EM> infections.” (Dr. med. Franke, gynecologist, Germany</P><P>Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a widespread infection, it is mainly caused by <EM>C. albicans</EM>. Hence, our team decided to focus on this infection which is a fundamental public health problem .</P><P>: “I’m diagnosing <EM>C. albicans</EM> infections solely through the symptoms of the patient like itching, burning, potentially discharge.” (Möhringer, general practitioner, Germany)</P><P>: “After examination of the patient I perform a pap test and grow the sample on Sabouraud Agar.” (PD Dr. Dr. med. Grunewald, dermatologist, Germany)</P><P>: “At Sex og Samfunn (Sex and Society, free clinic in Oslo), we would in most cases diagnose <EM>C. albicans</EM> by looking at the discharge under a microscope and look for fungal hyphae. If we do not observe any fungal hyphae, but the patient experience typical fungal infection symptoms, we recommend her to try an antifungal product to see if it helps. If the symptoms are chronic and she has earlier tried an antifungal product that did not relieve the symptoms, it happens that we take a sample from the patient and grow it for further inspection.” (Sex og Samfunn, Norway)</P><P>After interviewing 6 physicians with different backgrounds (gynecologists, dermatologists, general practitioner) we observed that doctors have different approaches on how to diagnose a vaginal <EM>C. albicans</EM> infection. </P><P>: &quot;women suffering from a vaginal <EM>C. albicans</EM> infection must either go to the doctor for diagnosis or self-treat by purchasing antimycotics over the counter without a prescription. Only 30% of all women who self-treat in Norway had an actual<EM>C. albicans</EM> infection” (http://www.antibiotikaiallmennpraksis.no/index.php?action=showtopic&amp;topic=DrmsfZGV 22.08.2018)</P><P>: “I would estimate that about 9/10 times I sell antimycotics against<EM>C. albicans</EM> infections to women that were not at physician before going to the pharmacy store.” (Margrethe K. Kristiansen, Pharmacist, Norway)</P><P>Antimicrobial resistance is a global problem that is constantly increasing and unspecific treatment like buying over-the-counter antimycotics for treating a non-existing <EM>C. albicans</EM> infection is reinforcing that issue. Our team agreed on an attempt to tackle the high number of misdiagnosis of<EM>C. albicans</EM> infections.</P><P>: “	I don’t know any test for detecting vaginal <EM>C. albicans</EM> infections. I don’t think pharmacy stores are selling them.” (Aina Kristin Pham, Pharmacist, Norway)</P><P>: “I know Canetest. It is a pH dependent test to distinguish between bacterial vaginosis and thrush. But I have never sold one. I think this is due to missing education and advertisement.” (Anita Binder, Pharmacist, Germany)</P><P>: “I really like the idea of an easy-to-use test for detecting <EM>C. albicans</EM> since this would lead to a more targeted and therefore better therapy. But I would like the test to be done at a practitioner, so that in case of a <EM>C. albicans</EM> infection the physician could prescribe the right antimycotics.” (Alexandra Möhringer, general practitioner, Germany)</P><P>: “In my opinion a test would be very meaningful. My personal idea would be that if a person is treated with antibiotics (for example for treating a bladder infection) the test could be sold together with the antibiotics, since the risk is very high that the women will get a fungal infection due to overgrowth of potentially pathogenic organisms.” (Dr. med. Bastian Czogalla, gynecologist, Germany)</P><P>The idea of a kit which can be performed at a physician or a pharmacist sounded promising. But what else should the test bring along? In order to request the acceptance of the test, we conducted a questionnaire. The participants were new master students at the Institute for Biosciences at the University of Oslo. </P><DIV style="display: inline-block;"><SPAN class="front" style="display:block;">Out of 66 participants, 71% (n=47) were female, while 29% (n=19) were male.The age of the participants ranged from 21 to 43 years, with a mean age of 24 years. More than 75% of the participants were under 26 years old.</SPAN></DIV><P><STRONG>Question: If you have the suspicion of suffering from a vaginal <EM>C. albicans</EM> infection, would you use a “home-testing kit” in order to obtain a more targeted treatment (1 being not likely and 5 being very likely)?</STRONG></P><DIV style="display: inline-block;"><SPAN class="front" style="display:block;">Female participants n = 41 , Male participants n = 15</SPAN></DIV><P>The answers were as expected very widespread. The reason for that could be, that people are not well informed about vaginal infections, especially with the fungus<EM>C. albicans</EM>. That’s why we added some general questions about vaginal<EM>C. albicans</EM> infections to the questionnaire:</P><P><STRONG>Question: Did you know what <EM>C. albicans</EM> is before the presentation?</STRONG></P><DIV style="display: inline-block;"><SPAN class="front" style="display:block;">Female participants n = 47 , Male participants n = 19</SPAN></DIV><P>The evaluation shows that more than half of the participants didn’t have prior knowledge of<EM>C. albicans</EM>, with a higher percentage of men not knowing about<EM>C. albicans</EM>. </P><P><STRONG>Question: Did you know that <EM>C. albicans</EM> is a frequent cause of vaginal infections?</STRONG></P><DIV style="display: inline-block;"><SPAN class="front" style="display:block;">Female participants n = 47 , Male participants n = 19</SPAN></DIV><P>About 2/3 of the participants didn’t know that <EM>C. albicans</EM> is a causative of vaginal infection.</P><P>The evaluation of the questionnaire showed that the participants were not well informed about<EM>C. albicans</EM>. Thereupon we were wondering if women are educated about the normal vaginal flora and thereby the right hygiene of the genital area.</P><P>: „I experienced that women are in general poorly educated about commensal microorganisms in the vaginal flora and the knowledge about good hygiene of the genital area is even worse. I could observe that people living in the city are commonly poorly informed whereupon women living on the countryside are even worse educated. In my opinion there is a big need of a campaign that should brief women about these topics.” (Dr. med. Franke, gynecologist, Germany)</P><P>: “No, I don’t think that women are well informed about these topics. Very often, we as physicians have to educate women about intimate care. In my opinion it would be a good idea to start a campaign for informing women about health of the genital area.” (PD Dr. Dr. med. Susanne Grunewald, dermatologist, Germany)</P><P> The outcome of the questionnaire and the interview with different physicians was the crucial factor for us to start the campaign “WHAT'S SOPP”. We established a flyer where women can get informed about the normal vaginal flora, the best hygiene of the genital area and the different symptoms and treatments between bacterial vaginitis and fungal vaginitis.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
