Public engagement
During HP, the primary aim of the team was to communicate and educate. And we targeted all age groups from kids to adults to senior elders.
Fireflies a common sighting in villages of Bengal were known to all. We asked them, how if we could light up leaves of a plant using the same mechanism that the firefly uses. The wonder lighted up in the eyes of people was immeasurable. And “Yes, indeed, with synthetic biology this has been done!” we said to them in Bangla. And then we explained them synthetic biology answering to their curious questions.
Here you can see for yourself the enthusiasm of this wise old man (Chachaji) of the village along with the little kids reading the Bangla poster to know what this BacMan is all about.
Public Engagement was indeed equally engaging for the local people and the team as well.
