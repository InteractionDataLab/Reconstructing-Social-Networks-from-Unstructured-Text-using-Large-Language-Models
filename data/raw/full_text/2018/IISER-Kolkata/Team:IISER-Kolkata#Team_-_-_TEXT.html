Animish Nilesh Vaze
Animish has been instrumental in starting the iGEM movement on the IISER Kolkata campus. He shares inexplicably immense love for Biology in general and cell biology and evolution in particular. This iGEM season, he has worked on molecular cloning in the lab and has managed the administrative affairs of the project.
Ankit Rajendra Amrutkar
Ankit is a physics major who has varied interdisciplinary interests ranging from neuroscience to astrophysics. He was involved mostly in molecular cloning in the lab and characterization of bacterial growth upon exposure to arsenic. In free time he is busy revising his favourite Naruto episodes.
Anmol Kumar
Anmol aspires to be a hardcore physicist but only after he has enough fun with biology during this iGEM project. He is known for his punctuality and rigorous work habits in the lab. His innovative brain that comes up with novel ways of “jugaad” (such as double slit gel electrophoresis and tape technique of date identification etc.) has saved the team a crucial resource, time, on a few instances. A Professional TT player and part time quora and insta addiction are his other engagements than iGEM.
Diptatanu Das
Diptatanu is best defined as a lot of experience and brilliance packed in a small, young kid. He has a good hand at microbiology techniques and has worked on the interlab, cloning and comp cell preparation exercises during the course of the project. When not in lab, you can find him smashing ping pong balls at the TT table or enjoying his time out with “you-know-who”.
Hrishika Rai
Hrishika is the keystone for the team who leads lab work in all directions at once. She survives on minimal diet and sleep and is determining working hard for the success of the project. She loves dancing to her favourite tunes while pipetting buffers at the workbench.
Madhavi Dipak Andhari
Madhavi, a Biology Major in the team, has worked previously in protein characterization and is used to at running SDS PAGE and agarose gels. She was involved with cloning and protein characterization of the PC CBD metal chelating part. Her heart lies in travelling and experiencing life in other parts of the world.
Pallab Datta
Pallab is a hardcore artist. He spends hours at his computer writing poetry either in Bengali or in Python. He has handled the Media Design and Mathematical Modelling aspects of the project. To name a few, painting, creative writing, calligraphy, twisting language to squeeze out jokes etc. are other talents of this polymath.
Paresh Rana
Paresh is a die-hard Star Wars fan who in day time likes to read pages after pages of fat novels and in the night venture out on ghost hunting. He is leading the iGEM 2018 Team of IISER Kolkata and expertises in PCR amplification and troubleshooting.
Souvik Ghosh
Souvik is the favourite choice as a lab partner for everyone in the team for his ever readiness to work. He is a Chemistry major by training and during the project he has earned proficiency in plasmid isolation among other techniques and has always volunteered for this tiring but important task when hundreds of colonies have to be screened by alkaline lysis. Playing PUBG, reading books, surfing on the internet etc. are his other skills.

Special mention
Rajlaxmi Saha
A prodigy at math as well as biology equally, Rajlaxmi is a jolly and easy-going girl. She has worked with the team closely during the proposal framing days of the project and has a notable share in making the team meet the iBEC (DBT) deadline on time. However, due to other academic commitments she could not join the team in the lab work phase of the project, but has been a constant well wisher.
