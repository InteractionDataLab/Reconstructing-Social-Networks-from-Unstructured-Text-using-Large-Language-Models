We come from different majors and levels of scientific
			careers, but passion and ardent love for biology gathered us together to develop and present an ideal work. As the
			Chinese proverb goes that if two people are of the same mind，their sharpness can cut through metal, it’s amazing and
			adorable that we’ve formed a strong mutual trust and effective communication. In short, there are 16 members in our
			team this year，and everyone have their own role，accordingly supporting each other. Meanwhile, we have 5 advisors,
			who have helped us a lot in different fields of biotechnology . The introductions of our members and advisors are
			listed as follows.
