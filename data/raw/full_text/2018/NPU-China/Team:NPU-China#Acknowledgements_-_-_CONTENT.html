						Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) is the only multidisciplinary and research-oriented in China that is
						simultaneously developing education and research programs in the fields of aeronautics, astronautics, and marine
						technology engineering. It is now affiliated to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Since
						the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC), NPU has always been one of the nation’s key
						universities. NPU is a member of the &quot;Outstanding University Alliance&quot; program and is honored as a National Role
						Model Unit, a National Pioneer for Optimal Advanced Basic-level Party Organization and a Model University for
						Graduate Employment etc. NPU adheres to the motto &quot; Loyalty，Integrity，Courage and Perseverance&quot; while carrying
						forward the spirit of &quot; Strong Preparation，Diligent Effort，Practical Attitude，and Creative Innovation&quot;. NPU has
						put its roots down in the west; dedicated itself to national defense and written several “firsts” into the
						history of the PRC. Now NPU will continue to pioneer new pathways into the future in the process of building a
						world first-class university and world first-class disciplines.This year is the 80th anniversary of NPU and
						we are grateful for the platforms that NPU provides for us to
						pursue technology and science. Hope a brighter future for our Alma Mater.</H6></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="section"><DIV class="col s8 m8 l8"><H5><B>The International Cooperation Office</B></H5><H6>The International Cooperation Office of Northwestern Polytechnical University is mainly responsible for the

						the Ecological and Environmental Research and Protection Center has always regarded the significant historical
						mission of human sustainable development in the post-industrial era as the core concern, and combines the
						advantages of the science and engineering discipline of NPU, with the intention of striving to develop into an
						ecological and environmental scientific research center with strong interdisciplinary and distinctive features.
						The Center intersects with existing relevant disciplines in the school, combining ecology and environmental
						protection research in life sciences with other disciplines to explore the laws of ecological and environmental
						change, as well as human coping strategies, trying to accord the governments, non-profit organizations, etc. with
						theoretical basis for decision-making.The Ecological and Environmental Research and Protection Center offered
						the laboratory and related equipment
						and reagents consumables for our project this year. The charger of the laboratory also conducted the necessary
						safety training along with basic experimental skills training for us, guaranteeing the normal procession of our
						experiments.</H6></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="section"><DIV class="col s8 m8 l8"><H5><B>Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences</B></H5><H6>The Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology (TIIB-CAS), Chinese Academy of Sciences is a scientific
