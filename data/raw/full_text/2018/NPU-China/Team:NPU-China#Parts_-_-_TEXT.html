Part overview
This year, NPU-China is committed to submitting a part library for the construction of the minimal             Saccharomyces             cerevisiae mitochondrial genome to the registry. We intensively characterized the part Plasmid Tightly             Regulated             Copy-Control System (PTRCCS) BBa_K2707007 , which we             utilized to splice and stabilize our target genome. This composite part has             played an egregiously critical role in our achieving the expansion of the S. cerevisiae mitochondrial genome in E.             coli.
We have improved the Team NWPUâ€™s part BBa_K2155001 this year, which encodes a BFD protein that catalyzes the             conversion of formaldehyde to DHA and hydroxy acetaldehyde. We obtained the mutant F464W BBa_K2707013 of this protein via point             mutation, whose function of converting formaldehyde into DHA and hydroxy acetaldehyde has been remarkably             enhanced             compared to the wild type.
We also submitted eight proteins that were successfully expressed by the mitochondrial genome of S.             cerevisiae.             Respectively, they are the three subunits of ATP synthase (atp6, atp8, atp9), cytochrome b (cob) and three             subunits             of cytochrome oxidase (cox1, cox2, cox3) as well as ribosomal protein (var1), among which cob and cox1 were             removed             all introns. Due to a lack of time and technical limitations, we did not obtain the data of these parts             expressing             in the mitochondria. But we have indeed gone all out to characterize these parts.
Part Table
Please include a table of all the parts your team has made during your project on             this page. Remember part characterization and measurement data must go on your team part pages on the             Registry.
