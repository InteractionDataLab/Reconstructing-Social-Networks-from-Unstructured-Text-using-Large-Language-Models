            DNA Time Capsule
        </H4><H5>

            ——Applying DNA to record kids’ dreams and motivating them to keep dreaming</H5></DIV><DIV class="container" style="padding-top: 30px;"><H5 class="center-align"><B>Introduction</B></H5><H5>
            There is such a plot in the novel &quot;The Three Body Problem&quot;：in the future, under the threat of outer space
            forces,
            human beings begin to study how to save important information for a longer time, only to find that Quantum
            Memory,
            which shows the best storage performance, merely lasts for two thousand years due to the decay of the
            internal
            substances thus cannot be read. What if we need to save information for 100 million years, or even more?
            The only
            way, according to the novel, is to engrave the words on the stones. Whereas we wonder whether there is any
            method
            with long storage time and small size in reality? Actually, there does exist, which lies squarely in our
            body - DNA,
            a medium that stores genetic information of life, and can also be utilized to store other sorts of
            information.
            Extraordinarily impressive should best describe the storage capacity of DNA. It only needs 1KG of DNA dry
            powder to
            store all the information in the world<SUP>[1]</SUP>, and then keeping the information stable for more than
            a
            million years
            shall be made possible by burying it in the frozen soil in the Antarctic or the Himalayas.</H5></DIV><DIV class="container" style="padding-top: 30px;"><H5 class="center-align"><B>Objective</B></H5><H5>
            This year, our project mainly focuses on the use of genetic synthesis technology to create an artificially
            designed
            mitochondrial genome. We hope to show the society a very tangible application of gene synthesis technology
            - data
            storage. Then we begin to ponder what sort of information we shall store with DNA? How about &quot;Dream&quot;? It is
            a more
            feasible and meaningful practice to store kids’ dreams in DNA, which we name “Time Capsule.”</H5></DIV><DIV class="container" style="padding-top: 30px;"><H5 class="center-align"><B>Collecting dreams</B></H5><H5>
            With this exciting and bracing idea, we came to Mawu Primary School in Chang'an District, Xi'an. First of
            all, we
            did a science activity with the children in Mawu Primary School to introduce them to some basic biological
            knowledge. To our surprise, the pupils have learned a lot about biological knowledge beforehand</H5></DIV><DIV class="container" style="padding-top: 30px;"><H5>
            Then we familiarized them with the idea of DNA Time Capsule. The children were full of curiosity about such
            novel
            technology, showing great interest and prodigious enthusiasm, irrespective of the fact that they didn't
            completely
            understand the principles of binary, quaternary and other coded message expertise as well as the details of
            materials science involving micro-nano scales. The kids were remarkably willing to share their dreams and
            write them
            down on the sheets later adhered to the blackboard. We promised to the children to record their dreams with
            DNA and
            reserve for them. When they grow up, they shall come back to us and see their dreams at that time by
            sequencing and
            decoding.</H5></DIV><DIV class="container" style="padding-top: 30px;"><H5 class="center-align"><B>Encoding the “dreams” into DNA</B></H5><H5>
            We converted Chinese characters into binary codes through ASCII and encoded them into DNA sequences. (link:
            DNA
            coding software). The sequence was synthesized and then constructed in pSB1C3 backbone and transformed into
            E.coli.
            Then we cultured the strain, extracted the plasmid and freeze-dried it into powder that is convenient for
            long-term
            preservation, which was then sealed in a vacuum glass vial and placed in the laboratory. Store the
            information in a
            freezer to achieve long-term stable storage
            Being of a small molecule scale, DNA is difficult to display. In order to achieve a better effect and let
            children
            virtually see their &quot;DNA time capsule&quot;, we used the website to simulate the secondary structure of these
            single-stranded RNAs carrying the DNA sequences of those &quot;dreams&quot;. (link:
            http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructure.html)
            And then we printed them on the paper which were put into the photo frames. We brought these frames along
            with the
            souvenirs to these little “dreamers”</H5></DIV><DIV class="container" style="padding-top: 30px;"><H5>
            It was a sheer elation for the children to receive the presents. Taking one of the children's dream DNA
            secondary
            structure diagram as an example, we familiarized the kids with the whole process of transcoding their
            dreams into
            DNA and employing software to simulate. We introduced them, in more detail, to DNA storage technology and
            gene
            synthesis technology. Although they could not particularly understand the secondary structure of DNA, we do
            believe
            that they have gripped our aspiration for them to stick to their dreams. Together we pledged to open their
            childhood
            dreams in the future when they bring the DNA secondary structure of their dreams to our school.</H5></DIV><DIV class="container" style="padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 50px"><H5>

            In recent years, the development of synthetic biology has been extremely rapid, and multitudes of
            interesting and
            practical applications have come into being. DNA synthesis techniques and applications using DNA as a
            functional
            material are also more frequently reported, such as information storage, DNA origami, DNA circuits, etc.
            The
            boundaries between life and machine are no longer as opposed as before, machines are getting more
            intelligent, and
            life is becoming more engineered. Our understanding of some traditional biological terms is also going
            broader and
            deeper, just like DNA, perceived as genetic material, can surprisingly be used to store information, serve
            as a
            target drug carrier or even as a practical circuit. How to present the latest progress of these sciences or
            industries to the public and the primary and middle school students who are currently fast sensing the
            world is a
            problem that all scientists should lavish attention on, which is related to the understanding and
            acceptance of
            technology and the inheritance and expansion of science. It has seemed to be an old fashion to just impart
            children
            with the skill of painting a culture dish. Therefore, we selected the form of storing &quot;dream&quot; with DNA to
            let
            children specifically touch the &quot;future&quot;. We are the first team to adopt this form, and we have witnessed
            the light
            of curiosity and aspiration from the eyes of those innocent children. When we saw the DNA secondary
            structure of
            these &quot;dreams&quot;, we were also moved, realizing that &quot;dream&quot; can be not merely a tedious text of words, but
            also a
            painting which can be touched and perceived. Thanks to this event, making it possible for us to touch the
            soft side
            of DNA synthesis technology.
            Simultaneously, the understanding of “life” seems much more diverse to us.
            When we think of DNA purely as a substance that stores &quot;life information,&quot; we wonder why it is
            &quot;quaternary&quot;? and why
            not &quot;binary&quot; of 0 and 1or other systems? Of course, but this requires us to explain it in the future. Plus,
            when we
            first saw the secondary structure of the DNA sequence that recorded the &quot;dreams&quot;, we felt very familiar
            with it,
            which is virtually identical as the symbol used by the aliens in &quot;Arrival&quot;. The form of the circle may be a
            fixed
            &quot;grammatical structure&quot;, with the surrounding branches expressing the specific meaning. This also makes us
            wonder
            whether there are really aliens who use DNA as a material to store information and use its two-dimensional
            or even
            three-dimensional structure as a specific symbol. This event, admittedly, allows us to broaden our
            understanding and
            imagination of the words &quot;DNA&quot; and even &quot;life&quot; and &quot;civilization&quot; from different angles. It is just simply
            novel and
            interesting.</H5></DIV><DIV class="container" style="padding-top: 30px;"><H5 class="center-align"><B>Introducing Synthetic Biology to Lanzhou University Social Practice Team</B></H5><H5>
            We met the Social Practice Team of Lanzhou University at the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology,
            Chinese
            Academy of Sciences. The theme of their social practice was energy conservation and emission reduction. Our
            advisor
            Zhuo Bingzhao introduced the future prospectives and the role that synthetic organisms play in energy
            conservation
            and emission reduction from six aspects: renewable energy, green energy, green chemistry, agricultural
            industrialization, air pollution detection and air pollution prevention. They expressed their interest in
            synthetic
            biology and decided to know more about synthetic biology when they returned to school. </H5></DIV><DIV class="container" style="padding-top: 30px;"><H5><B>Reference:</B></H5><H6><SPAN>
