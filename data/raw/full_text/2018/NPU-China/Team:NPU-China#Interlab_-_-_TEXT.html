We're glad to participate the fifth Interlab study with many other teams around the world. This year,             the             aim of Interlab study is to find out whether we can reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence             measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units instead of OD. We are                 happy                 that measurement community for accepting our data. It's an interesting and valuable experience             to do this work
1. Unit calibration measurements
1.1 Measurement of LUDOX CL-X OD600 reference point

2. Cell measurement
2.1 Transformation of 8 test devices into competent DH5α cells
The transformation was successful. There was a sufficient amount of colonies on plates except device 4             ,             which only grew two colonies. We picked 2 colonies from each plates and inoculate in LB medium +             chloramphenicol overnight at 37°C and 220 rpm.
