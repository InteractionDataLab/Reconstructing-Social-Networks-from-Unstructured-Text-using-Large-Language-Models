Plasmid Tightly Regulated Copy-Control System (PTRCCS)
1．Usage
1.1 Briefing on PTRCCS
PTRCCS, namely the Plasmid Tightly Regulated Copy-Control System in pGF (plasmid Genome Fast) Vector [1],             can help             the artificially synthesized genomes achieve stable replication in E. coli, and tightly control the copy             number             conversion of the synthetic genome in the E. coli - EPI300 strain, converting the single copy into the copy             number             of             up to 100. It has been reported that a variety of artificially synthesized genomes, such as Saccharomyces             cerevisiae             genome [2] and plant virus genome [3], have been successfully synthesized using vectors containing this             system.
1.2 The significance of PTRCCS to our project
This year, we successfully employed this system to convert the assembled mitochondrial genomes of S.                 cerevisiae                 into E. coli for stable cloning.
In the course of our experiments, there has been a very serious problem, which was stable genomic clones             could not             be             obtained in E. coli and random mutations and deletions occurred after the assembly of mitochondrial genomes             in             Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Later, with reference to the design of pGF Vector, we added this system to our             vector and             successfully obtained the artificial genome synthesized by stable cloning in E. coli.
1.3 Providing reference for the teams to participate
Based on our researches, it is safe to say that we are the first team in all iGEM teams to manually design             and             synthesize vital genomes. With consideration of the importance of PTRCCS to the successful competition of             our             project             this year, we strongly recommend that PTRCCS be used by all teams working on related subject. Good news is             that             there             are already commercial products based on this system and hopefully the complete vector DNA containing the             system             will             be soon available. If necessary, please feel free to contact us and we are more than glad to provide the             complete             vector containing PTRCCS we used this year.
2．Biology
PTRCCS consists of two parts: (1) ParA-ParB-ParC plasmid partition system; (2) oviS/oviV copy-control             system.
Figure 1.Gene map of Plasmid Tightly Regulated Copy-Control System (PTRCCS)
2.1 ParA-ParB-ParC plasmid partition system：
The ParA-ParB-ParC from the F plasmid in E. coli consists of three elements that are essential for plasmid             partition:             Protein SopA, Protein SopB and Cis-acting region sopC. The system ensures the proper distribution of             newly-replicated             plasmids to daughter cells during cell division, when these proteins mutually impact. [4]
2.2 oriS/oriV Copy-Control system：
The oriS/oriV Copy-Control system is comprised of the oriS(ori2)-repE-incC system that controls a single             copy of the             plasmid and the oriV/(TrfA) system that implements a strictly controllable multicopy. [5] The             oriS(ori2)-repE-incC             system derives from F plasmid in E. coli, composed of replicon oriS(ori2), protein repE and incompatibility             region             incC. In the single copy mode, plasmid replication initiates at oriS (ori2), which consists of (1) four             directly             repeated sequences of 19 bp (iterons), (2) an AT-rich region, and (3) binding sites for the host DnaA             protein. The             RepE protein (251 residues, 29 kD), when in the monomeric form, mediates the assembly of a replication             complex at             oriS. The dimeric form of RepE binds to the inverted repeats of the repE operator exerting autogenous             repression.             [6]
The oriV/(TrfA) system derives from RK2 Vector. The oriV origin of replication consists of eight 17- bp             direct             repeats (iterons) that bind a monomeric form of the initiation protein TrfA [7]. DNA replication oriV is             completely             inactive in the commonly used hosts, because they do not produce the TrfA replication protein upon which             replication             at oriV depends. To supply the TrfA protein, Jadwiga Wild and his partner constructed special hosts, in             which the             synthesis of copy-up TrfA mutant protein is very tightly controlled by the ParaBAD (PBAD) promoter and AraC             protein.             [8]
3.Characterization
3.1 PTRCCS verified to be useful
We have not been able to convert the assembled mitochondrial genome of S. cerevisiae into E. coli for             stable cloning             even after numerous attempts before applying this system. Nonetheless, hardly had we equipped the vectors             with this             system when we successfully realized the cloning of the assembled mitochondrial genome in Saccharomyces             cerevisiae             which was later transferred into E. coli for stable cloning.

3.2 Characterization Purpose：
Jadwiga Wild and his partner pointed out in their work that vectors containing this system were capable of             conversion             from single copy mode to multiple copy mode only after induction and the copy number was determined by the             length of             the sequences inserted in the vectors. [8]
Therefore, we measured the copy number of the vector containing the system in the case of inserting the             minimal S.             cerevisiae genome sequence we designed this year.
We adopted the QPCR method to measure the E. coli plasmid copy number, which was ever carried out by Lee C,             Kim J,             Shin S G, et al. [9]
The follows are needed to characterize the part:
3.3 Protocol of Copy Number Determination qPCR
3.3.1 Lysate standard sample qPCR
1. Inoculate a single colony into 5 mL of liquid LB medium with corresponding antibiotic and incubate in             the shaker             at 37 °C;
2. After 14-16h of growth, transfer 100 μL of suspended cells to 5 mL of fresh liquid LB medium with             corresponding             antibiotic and incubate at 37 °C until the OD600 reaches 0.7-0.8;
3. Spin down a suspended 1 mL of cells of 0.7 OD600 at 8.0g for 15 min
(Growth conditions are specified at the end of the protocol);
4. Remove the medium and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of PBS;
5. Spin down the suspended of cells at 8.0 g for 15 min;
6. Repeat steps 2 and 3;
7. Completely remove PBS from the cell pellet;
8. Incubate cells at 95 °C for 10 min;
9. Store cells at -20 °C for 10 min;
10. Completely resuspend dry cell pellet in 100 μL of water by pipetting. Then vortex for 30s and spin             down;
11. Make an initial dilution by transferring 10 μL of resuspended cell to 40 μL of water. Pipet carefully             vortex for             30s and spin down;
12. Make a second dilution by transferring 10 μL of to 90 μL of water. Pipet carefully vortex for 30s and             spin down;
13. For X reactions, make two different mixes using chromosome gene and plasmid gene primers:
X*6 μL of water
X*1 μL Forward primer 20 uM
X*1 μL Reverse primer 20 uM
X*10 μL of SYBR Green
14. First, transfer 18 μL of mix with chromosome primers to first X tubes, then transfer 18 μL of plasmid             primers             mix             to other X tubes (X*2 tubes);
15. Add 2 μL of each diluted sample to the tubes;
16. Tenderly close the caps;
17. Run the reaction.
For steps 13-15, increase the volumes by a factor of desired technical replicate numbers.
3.3.2 Data Analysis
(1) By using the equation from standard curve that relates plasmid Ct value to real plasmid number             calculate the             plasmid number in the sample.
(2) By using the equation that relates chromosome Ct to real chromosome number calculate the number of             chromosomes             in the sample.
(3) Chromosome number = cell number. Therefore, by dividing the obtained plasmid number by chromosome             number we can             find the plasmid per cell number.
