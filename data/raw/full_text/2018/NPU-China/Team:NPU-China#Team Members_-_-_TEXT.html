Hi, meet 16 iGEMers behind our project from NPU-2018 here! We come from different majors and levels of scientific    careers, but passion and ardent love for biology gathered us together to develop and present an ideal work. As the    Chinese proverb goes that if two people are of the same mind，their sharpness can cut through metal, it’s amazing and    adorable that we’ve formed a strong mutual trust and effective communication. In short, there are 16 members in our    team this year，and everyone have their own role，accordingly supporting each other. Meanwhile, we have 5 advisors,    who have helped us a lot in different fields of biotechnology . The introductions of our members and advisors are    listed as follows.
Weifeng Lin
Hi！I am a junior student, majoring in biotechnology. It’s my second time to join iGEM. I’m glad to be student      leader this year. To be honest, this work is not easy as I thought before.I like spending time on eating good food      and discovering new things. My favorite role is Shelden Lee Copper in the big bang theory.
Meixuan Lee
I'm a sophomore from NPU-2018, mainly responsible for experiments and materials. While I'm majoring in biology,      becoming an ice-cream seller is actually my ultimate goal. Learning a lot in our project, it's both challenging      and enjoyable to be an iGEMer. By the way, I love britpop and Márquez, trying to learn guitar and español now.
Yuan Ma
Hello! I am a junior student at Northwestern Polytechnical University, majoring in materials science and      engineering, and minoring in biotechnology. To be honest, I really like biology. I am trying to apply the      knowledge of materials science to biology. I think iGEM is a very good platform, where I meet great teammates and      also have a great time.
Qingyang Lee
Hi, this is Arthur! Yeah, I’m suffering my sophomore year in NPU but it’s been a great honor to be an iGEMer. IT      IS THE HARDEST TIME EVER SINCE MY COLLEGE LIFE! But still, I’ve learned a lot and really appreciated the      opportunity. It’s my first time to be here, so let’s have some fun!!!
Kai Wang
I'm very glad to get a new identity of being a iGEMer this year. In NPU-CHina, I'm responsible for the experiment      and HP, and I have learnt a lot from my teammates as well as my friends. It's my honor to join this competition      and communicate with other iGEMers. I’ll explore my potential as it's said “Stay hungry，Stay foolish”
Qianlong Liu
Hello! My name is qianlong Liu.My major is biological technology.I like to make new friends from all over the      world.And I also love science and exploration. Approaching the truth in nature is my favorite thing. I am pleased      to talk to others about strange phenomena and creatures. I am responsible for experiment
Junyou Li
I am a junior student majoring in Polymer Materials and Engineering, and I'm fond of English and Chemistry and      mainly work on translation and experiment in the team NPU-China. During my leisure time, I will also spend some      time doing some sports to strengthen my body. But travelling is always what I have been keen on most.
Temuer Batu
I am a Mongolian; My Chinese name is Yuhan Ke. I am a senior at NPU-China majoring in mathematics. As one of the      non-bio students. I am learning new things in the wet lab while spending the rest of time staring at my laptop      doing wiki pages and trying to implement the complicated model that comes with all our many parts.
Huiqiao Mi
I am a sophomore of NPU majoring in Biotechnology(conducted in English). Easy-going as I am, I am also a little      bit demanding in something vital. It’s my honor to participate in iGEM and be responsible for art design of team,      including team logo, wiki, poster, PPT and uniforms. I hope can make friends and have a fun time.
Yihong Shi
I’m a sophomore student majoring biotechnology. In the preparation of iGEM, I participated in experiment, human      practice and web design，which was challenging yet inspring. Amiable and capable, faithful and purposeful,      industrious and ingenious, I brace myself for challenge to the brand new field of synthetic biology!
Shanshan Lee
I am a rising sophomore majoring in Biotechnology (conducted in English) in NPU and originally from Tianjin China.      As one of the new members of the team, I am dutiful and careful, apprehensive and cooperative, and dedicated to      the work on iGEM’s team. Aside from Science, I have fun singing songs and practicing Chinese calligraphy.
Bingzhao Zhuo (advisor)
iosynthesis and iGEM have brought me really a lot. As the advisor of NPU-China this year, the growth of new staff      and their advancement of capability enhance the efficiency of our team and also surprised me. I like the feeling      of mutual learning and enhancement. I will accompany the team all the time and I believe that tomorrow is another      day.
Yue Yang (advisor)
Yue Yang ,born in1995.Now she’s a postgraduate student in NWPU, major in synthetic biology.Her main job is the      construction of natural product biosynthetic pathways.
Fei Hao (advisor)
I am a doctoral student , majoring in synthetic biology, at NWPU. I feel honored to be invited as a adviser of      NPU-China, and It will be an unforgettable experience with these excellent members. I’m sure that with everybody’s      passion and hard work, we will make a big breakthrough in the iGEM competition this time.
Wenhao Xia (advisor)
I am a master student in NWPU,majoring in biology. My research interests are the biosynthesis pathway of natural      products, As the advisor of NPU-China, I'm happy to grow with the team, I'm sure everyone will get better.
ZiHe Lee
Zihe Li,or Leo Li as an english name,graduated from Wuhan University,collage of life science.I am an advisor in      NPU team and offer any kind of help about bioinformatic problem.My reseach interest is in artificial design of      biological system in synthestical biology such as enzyme design and codon optimization.
