                        </H4></DIV><H5>Our project this year is to simplify the sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
                        mitochondrial
                        genome
                        and achieve de novo synthesis. This topic is completely removed from our previous entries, and
                        it
                        is a
                        totally blank
                        area for us to explore. Therefore, there are four “Bigger Pictures” that we are enormously
                        curious
                        about
                        and yearn
                        to know:
                        Safety is always the first. Does our subject comply with the relevant laws and regulations? Is
                        our
                        subject
                        within
                        the security framework of the iGEM Organizing Committee? How do experts in this field view the
                        safety
                        of
                        “artificial
                        life”?
                        Objectives and significance count. Is this an innovative yet meaningful exploration? Can the
                        project
                        provide a
                        reference or research basis for the further study in related fields, such as artificial life
                        research,
                        mitochondrial
                        research, gene synthesis, etc.?
                        We do not need to understand the background knowledge of mitochondria, including genetic
                        background,
                        recent
                        research
                        progress, etc.
                        It is imperative for us to understand the technology of gene synthesis, including technological
                        evolution,
                        the
                        latest research progress, mature commercial applications and so forth.
                        As follows the Human Practice activities we have carried out or partaken in this year are
                        listed:
                        
                        [1]. Took part in the 4th Synthetic Biology Young Scholar Forum;

                        [9]. Attending the iGEM Summit of Nine Universities;
                        The following is a brief summary of our achievements of these four aspects that we have learned
                        from
                        the
                        above
                        exchanges and activities:<B>1.Bigger Picture of Safety:</B>
                        We learned about China's genetically modified regulatory system, evaluation system and the laws
                        and
                        regulations
                        pertaining to the research or commercial promotion of genetically modified gene from the speech
                        by
                        Mr.
                        Zhang Xianfa,
                        Deputy Secretary General of the National Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms Safety
                        Management
                        Standardization Technical Committee and Deputy Director of the Department of Genetically
                        Modified
                        Biosafety
                        and
                        Intellectual Property of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of
                        Agriculture.
                        [1]
                        We confirmed that our researches are highly in compliance with relevant national laws and
                        regulations.
                        Also, we have
                        strictly reported the safety-related project information in accordance with the requirements of
                        the
                        iGEM
                        Organizing
                        Committee and participated in the safety training of the laboratories. No safety incidents have
                        occurred
                        since the
                        project was launched. (see Safety for details)
                        We resorted to Jiang Huifeng, a researcher specializing in biocomponent design and chassis
                        modification,
                        for his
                        views on the safety issues of “artificial life”. [2]
                        Additionally, we were delighted that we happened to learn the GMP standard for medical Oligos
                        synthesis
                        from TSINKE
                        BIOTECH and learned about their work on the strict control of medical primer safety. [3]<B>2.Bigger Picture of Project Importance：</B>
                        From the speech by Academician Zhao Guoping, we learned that the “convergence technology” that
                        combines
                        bioinformatics, big data and synthetic biology is the future direction of development of life
                        sciences.
                        Being an
                        innovative exploration, our project is intricately entwined with bioinformatics and synthetic
                        biology.
                        [4]
                        Our project has been unanimously affirmed and encouraged by Researcher Jiang Huifeng [2],
                        Professor
                        Gu
                        Zhenglong
                        [5], Researcher Dai Junyi [4], Dr. Du [6], etc. They maintain that our work is a brave
                        scientific
                        exploration that
                        can provide empirical reference and research basis for artificial life research, mitochondrial
                        research,
                        and gene
                        synthesis. Professor Gu Zhenglong [5] even directly proposed his willingness to cooperate with
                        us
                        for a
                        longer time,
                        hoping to further expand the research based on our work.
                        Dr. Xue Xiaoli [1] has set up a positive example for us to create a single-chromosome genome of
                        Saccharomyces
                        cerevisiae, inspiring us to challenge the impossible of life and strive to create new life.<B>3.Bigger Picture of Mitochondrial Research：</B>
                        We contacted Professor Gu Zhenglong, who has long been working on mitochondrial research. Prof.
                        Gu
                        systematically
                        introduced the biological and genetic background of mitochondria, through which we have learned
                        about
                        the
                        important
                        effects of mitochondria in cellular aerobic respiration, cancer and multi-gene regulation.
                        Today,
                        mitochondrial gene
                        editing still remains a difficult task, and choosing to re-deliver through the entire genome
                        may be
                        a
                        possible way
                        that leads to the discovery of something new. [5]<B>4.Bigger Picture of Gene (Genome) Synthesis Technology：</B>
                        Through the communication with Dr. Jiang [2] and the speech by Dr. Dai [4], we learned a lot
                        about
                        the
                        artificial
                        life, which was preliminarily a work that only God can achieve. Plus, we also accessed the
                        classic
                        cases
                        where
                        small-scale viral genes were synthesized to large-scale Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes.
                        We learned about OGAB gene synthesis technology from the speech by Professor Akihiko Kondo [1],
                        the
                        gene
                        synthesis
                        technology from TACG BioTech system [7], the answer to the &quot;source of artificial life&quot; from
                        TSINGKE
                        BioTech. [3],
                        and the commercial application mode of gene synthesis technology from GENERAL BIOSYSTEMS [6]
                        Furthermore, we have gained a new perspective on DNA and life in the course of DNA Time Capsule
                        activity.
                        [10]<B>These exchanges and activities portrayed for us the complete “Bigger Pictures” that are
                            directly
                            or
                            indirectly
                            related to our project, which has greatly expanded our vision of the project and imparted
                            us
                            with
                            substantially
                            important knowledge and left valuable spiritual wealth to us.
                            Absolutely, what we have harvested from these HP activities is not merely confined to the
                            exploration
                            of “Bigger
                            Picture”, benefitting us even more in the following four aspects:</B><B>Objective:</B>


                        Recommendations from Dr. Jiang on the preferential selection of relatively small mitochondrial
                        genomes
                        [2]
                        and Prof.
                        Gu's introduction of the importance of mitochondria in life activities in eukaryotes and the
                        difficulty
                        of
                        genetic
                        editing [5], as well as other professionals' assessment of our project made us clear about the
                        objective of
                        our
                        project this year: to creatively simplify the design of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
                        mitochondrial
                        genome
                        and
                        achieve de novo synthesis to explore new areas of artificial life for the research on
                        artificial
                        life,
                        mitochondrial
                        and gene synthesis, offering our own experience and laying a foundation for deeper research.<B>Design:</B>
                        Dr. Jiang suggested that we use a combination of multi-genome comparisons and homologous
                        evolution
                        analysis
                        to
                        figure out the strategy for the simplification of mitochondrial genomes based on existing gene
                        annotation
                        files. Dr.
                        Cheng, a member in the research group of Dr. Jiang, specifically guided us through the design
                        of
                        the

                        genome.
                        [2]
                        Prof. Gu suggested that we add a GFP reporting module to this minimal genome for visual
                        detection
                        of
                        new
                        mitochondrial genome functions. [5]
                        During the design of experimental schemes, TACG BioTech suggested that we divide the whole
                        genome
                        so
                        that
                        the
                        interface sequence between each fragment can be free of these complex sequence regions, which
                        would
                        facilitate
                        subsequent splicing.
                        We referred to the work report of Researcher Wang Manli when the genome splicing encountered
                        difficulties
                        [1] and
                        timely adjusted the experimental design, adding the plasmid replication stability module and
                        the
                        plasmid
                        copy number
                        control module, through which we ultimately realized the complete genome synthesis.

                        TACG BioTech accorded us with a laboratory to carry out the genome synthesis work and
                        complimentary
                        support
                        for the
                        completion of the work. [7] TACG Biotech also helped us finish the synthesis of most of the
                        kb-level
                        primary
                        fragments and specifically guided the subsequent synthesis of the entire genome. [7]
                        Dr. Jiang gave us the access to his laboratory and provided us with some reagent supplies. [2]
                        Dr. Jiang answered our questions in the mid-term progress of the experiment and gave feedback
                        as
                        well
                        as
                        guidance on
                        the progress of the experiment and the achievements of the mid-term experiment. There were some
                        repetitive
                        and
                        polluting events occurred in our experiments at that time. Dr. Jiang proposed that we might as
                        well
                        “return
                        to zero”
                        in light of the laboratory condition. Moreover, we were also kindly told to lavish due
                        attention on
                        the
                        experimental
                        operation and conduct a negative and positive control. [2]
                        Dr. Guo's experimental advice on extracting plasmids directly from a relatively larger amount
                        of
                        Saccharomyces
                        cerevisiae showed no effect, but the accumulated valuable experience is conducive to the
                        further
                        development of our
                        experiments. [4]
                        Ruan Jiangxing from the research group of Dr. Jiang guided our experiments of mitochondrial
                        genome
                        extraction and
                        Saccharomyces cerevisiae rho0 cell preparation. [2] We obtained the important chassis for the
                        subsequent S.
                        cerevisiae genome transformation.
                        Prof. Gu was willing to help us with the following genome delivery work and assisted us in
                        functional
                        verification
                        and longer-term functional extension studies based on the minimal genome. [5]<B>Presentation:</B>

                        The background research on mitochondrial biology is the focus of our HP. For our project, which
                        falls
                        into basic
                        researches and exploration, consulting senior scholars in related fields is probably the most
                        effective
                        approach to
                        &quot;crossing the threshold&quot;. With the help of Dr. Jiang, we contacted Professor Gu Zhenglong of
                        Cornell
                        University.
                        Prof. Gu has long been committed to the function, evolution and correlation of mitochondria.
                        Also,
                        he
                        devotes
                        himself to the study of evolution of aerobic fermentation of yeast and the effects of this
                        process
                        on
                        the
                        physiology and multi-gene regulation of complex diseases such as cancer.
                        We have had an in-depth interaction with Prof. Gu in several substantial aspects, which are
                        respectively project
                        objectives and background research, genome design, project experimentation and subsequent
                        genome
                        delivery. And
                        Prof. Gu indeed provided us with exceedingly valuable and specific advice and support.
                    </H5><H5 style="padding-top: 20px;"><B> Objectives and background:</B></H5><H5>
                        We consulted Prof. Gu on the academic significance and possible specific applications of
                        simplifying
                        the
                        mitochondrial genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its de novo synthesis, and he was quite
                        pleased to
                        learn that
                        we were designing and synthesizing the minimal mitochondrial genome. He positively confirmed
                        the
                        remarkable
                        significance of our project, maintaining that the simplified design of the mitochondrial genome
                        and
                        its
                        de novo
                        synthesis are, till now, a field that entails further exploration. Chances are great that the
                        research
                        like this
                        will provide a new engineered idea for the study of mitochondrial genes and their functions, as
                        well as
                        the
                        treatment of diseases related to mitochondria. There is a high possibility to create a minimal
                        model
                        chassis,
                        providing a new yet reliable reference for the researches in relevant fields. 
                        Prof. Gu further said that with regard to mitochondrial research, the current method is only to
                        knock
                        out or add
                        some certain genes. However, even such seemingly simple requirements have high operational
                        difficulty
                        in practical
                        experiments. Even with the Crispr-Cas9 method, rapid and simple gene editing will not be that
                        easy.
                        On
                        the one
                        hand,
                        it is difficult to express Cas9 protein in mitochondria, yet the use of a guide peptide to
                        deliver
                        Cas9
                        protein in
                        cytoplasm is also not satisfactory. On the other hand, the difficulty of screening caused by
                        multiple
                        copies of
                        mitochondria results in a low success rate at the same time. 
                        It is a very convenient way to use the characteristics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that it can
                        survive
                        in a
                        reducing
                        carbon source medium in the absence of a mitochondrial genome to deliver the entire de novo
                        synthesized
                        genome
                        directly into the mitochondrial membrane. Of course, this also requires high-quality genomic
                        DNA
                        and
                        efficient
                        delivery methods. 
                        Prof. Gu professed that he had long had plans to do this work. He has unique experience and
                        skills
                        in
                        mitochondrial
                        genome delivery technology, and we were more than glad that he expressed his willingness to
                        offer
                        us
                        technical
                        support in the late genome delivery. </H5><H5 style="padding-top: 20px;"><B> Genomic design:</B></H5><H5>
                        In designing the minimal S. cerevisiae mitochondrial genome, Prof. Gu suggested that we add a
                        GFP
                        reporter module
                        to
                        this minimal genome, which should make it easier to know if the genome's transcriptional
                        translation
                        system is
                        working properly and also more vivid to display the results, rendering the project fancier.
                    </H5><H5 style="padding-top: 20px;"><B> Progress of experiments:</B></H5><H5>
                        In the splicing process of genomic fragments, we encountered a serious problem, which was the
                        spliced
                        plasmids
                        showed irregular base mutation or fragment loss. We thus consulted Prof. Gu for possible causes
                        and
                        solutions. 
                        Prof. Gu shared with us his previous experimental experience, where he constructed the human
                        mitochondrial genome
                        into E. coli vector and transferred it into E. coli, and similar random mutations and fragment
                        loss
                        also occurred.
                        He speculated that the reason might be the content of A and T bases in the mitochondrial genome
                        is
                        too
                        high (about
                        85%), leading to the failure of balance of four nucleotides and the death of cells. Based on
                        this
                        experience, we
                        adjusted the experimental protocol and used a low-copy vector to lay the foundation for the
                        splicing of
                        the genome
                        that finally succeeded. The interaction with Prof. Gu allows us to have new solutions to the
                        experimental problems
                        we encountered. 
                        Genome delivery and functional verification in the future work: 
                        Prof. Gu expressed his willingness to help us with the following genome delivery and to assist
                        us
                        in
                        functional
                        verification and long-term functional extensions based on minimal genomes. The interaction and
                        cooperation with
                        Prof. Gu have laid a vitally crucial foundation for us to continue to improve our entire
                        project.

                        Syn1.0-Syn3.0
                        project that top scientists such as Craig Venter and Gibson have been devoted into, which
                        centers
                        around
                        simplifying
                        the design and de novo synthesis of the mycoplasma genome and achieving the breakthrough of
                        artificially creating
                        the simplest living body. We also learned the rapid development of genome synthesis technology
                        in
                        recent years,
                        including the synthesis of artificial genome synthesis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and E. coli.
                        Dr.
                        Jiang suggested
                        we study the mitochondrial genome starting with a smaller genome size. On the one hand, there
                        is no
                        precedent for
                        simplifying the design of mitochondrial genome and synthesizing it from the beginning. Such
                        research
                        bears a
                        positive scientific exploration significance and can also provide some reference for the
                        research
                        of
                        the simplest
                        life design, mitochondrial research and etc. On the other hand, the mitochondrial genome scale
                        is
                        relatively small,
                        with only several Ks. Compared with other living organism genomes, the synthesis cost and cycle
                        are
                        more
                        advantageous, making the project more tangible. Dr. Jiang expressed his willingness to help us
                        in
                        genome design and
                        synthesis. Additionally, Dr. Jiang also assisted us in contacting Professor Gu Zhenglong of
                        Cornell
                        University, who
                        has long been committed to the study of the relationship between mitochondrial gene and
                        function
                        and
                        basic
                        researches on mitochondrial diseases.
                    </H5><H6>After the exchange, we also had some exchanges with Nankai University, where we discussed the
                        projects
                        with each
                        other this year. Our advisers gave them some suggestions for the competition.</H6><H5>
                        What is more, we also consulted Dr. Jiang about the safety of artificially designed life. The
                        &quot;Pandora
                        Box&quot; effect
                        that synthetic biotechnology may bring is a constant concern of the scientific community as
                        well as
                        the
                        society.
                        Dr.
                        Jiang first affirmed our concern about this issue. He believes that this is a problem that all
                        researchers need to
                        consider. After all, our understanding of nature is still not comprehensive. There are always
                        such
                        defects in the
                        researches based on experimental science, requiring researchers to seriously abide by the
                        existing
                        laws
                        and
                        regulations and conduct scientific research and exploration in the existing framework. Dr.
                        Jiang
                        also
                        pointed out
                        that blind panic was not necessary and the further study should not be therefore foregone.
                        Safety
                        should be judged
                        according to the content of different research projects, rather than denied regardless.

                        In the course of designing the minimal mitochondrial genome, Dr. Jiang suggested that we use
                        the
                        existing gene
                        annotation files combined with multi-genomic comparison and homologous evolution analysis to
                        determine
                        the
                        importance of the genes in the wild-type S. cerevisiae mitochondrial genome. He assigned Dr.
                        Cheng
                        Jian, who is
                        responsible for the calculation of biological information in his research group, to guide us
                        through
                        the design of
                        the entire genome. (see Design &amp; Model for specific design).

                        During the process of genome synthesis, Dr. Jiang assigned his master student, Qi Jiangxing, to
                        guide
                        us on the
                        extraction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial genome and the preparation of
                        Saccharomyces
                        cerevisiae rho0
                        cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae that lost the mitochondrial genome). He gave us the access to
                        their
                        lab
                        and
                        provided
                        us with some experimental reagent supplies.

                        In the middle of the summer break, Dr. Jiang made a mid-term progress consultation for
                        NKU-China
                        and
                        our team, and
                        gave feedback and guidance on the progress and results of the mid-term experiment. There were
                        some
                        repetitive and
                        polluting problems in our experiments at that time, thus Dr. Jiang suggested that we might as
                        well
                        “return to zero”
                        for the lab, pay attention to the experimental operation and carry out a negative and positive

                        Visited the primer synthesis workshop in person and learned the principle of primer synthesis

                        the

                        For the first time we visually witnessed the apparent traits of a large number of primers. 
                        Visited the GMP primer synthesis workshop and learned the specifications of safe production of

                        Gene is the basic unit of life. The essence of artificial life is to artificially design and
                        synthesize
                        the genome
                        of a living body. Then, as for the synthesis of genes, what do we use as raw materials? And how
                        to
                        synthesize?
                        These
                        are a technical background that is closely related to our project. In other words, where is the
                        source
                        of
                        artificial
                        life? With this kind of philosophy question, which is also the core issue of life sciences, we
                        paid
                        a
                        visit to
                        TSINGKE BIOTECH in Beijing to conduct a project survey and expand our “Bigger Picture” layout
                        with
                        the
                        introduction
                        of TACG BioTech. 
                        Mr. Chen Yuntao, Director of the Primer Synthesis Workshop of TSINGKE BIOTECH, and Mr. Hao Yun,
                        Marketing Manager,
                        warmly received us. 
                        Ir. Chen first introduced the synthesis of primers, which every student who has done molecular
                        cloning
                        has been
                        exposed to. On the alkali-treated silicon-based surface, the protecting group-modified
                        deoxyribonucleotides
                        underwent a controlled addition of chemical &quot;protection and deprotection&quot; cycles, ultimately
                        forming
                        Oligos with a
                        length of 15 bp to 250 bp. Ir. Chen then led us to visit their standard primer synthesis
                        workshop,
                        where more than
                        20 different models of the Oligos synthesizer in the gigantic workshop kept writing the book of
                        life
                        like a printer
                        --- Oligos. He took us to one of their independently developed Oligos synthesizer with 192
                        flux,
                        picking up a
                        bottle
                        containing oligonucleotide monomers and proudly said to us, &quot;This is the answer to your
                        research.&quot;
                        Before our
                        departure, we took a photo with Ir. Chen with the four monomers A, T, C, and G that can be used
                        to
                        write the book
                        of
                        life. It is conceivable that in the following 24 hours, these raw materials will be synthesized
                        into
                        primers and
                        sent to researchers all over the country to write a grand blueprint for workers devoted into
                        life
                        sciences.
                        Whenever
                        we think of this scene, it is difficult for us to hide our excitement and ecstasy. </H5><H6 class="center">

                        Ir. Chen continued to introduce us to the whole process of primer synthesis - ammonia
                        hydrolysis -
                        initial
                        inspection - purification - quality inspection - lyophilization. He took a tube of yellow
                        material
                        from
                        a primer
                        lyophilizer, saying “this is the primer that you usually use&quot;. It was the first time for us to
                        see
                        the
                        primers in
                        person, which was an absolutely unexpected startling surprise. Ir. Chen explained to us that in
                        this
                        small test
                        tube, there were Oligos with a number of tens of thousands of OD, which were tailored to our
                        big
                        customers, which
                        indeed impressed us a lot.
                    </H5><H5 style="padding-top: 20px;">
                        After visiting the standard primer synthesis workshop, Ir. Chen also showed us around their GMP
                        standard primer
                        synthesis workshop, which is mainly used for the synthesis of Oligo probes for synthetic
                        disease
                        diagnosis. The GMP
                        standard is a quality management standard that all medical drug synthesis processes in China
                        need
                        to
                        strictly abide
                        by. We didn't expect that even simple primers also had medical safety requirements, which once
                        again
                        expanded our
                        &quot;Bigger Picture&quot; layout. We hold the firm belief that with the advancement of technology,
                        genetic
                        editing
                        technologies like Crispr in the future will have substantive applications. So how does TSINGKE
                        BIOTECH
                        ensure the
                        safety of the primers used in this process? Ir. Chen told us that they have been also paying
                        attention
                        to this
                        issue
                        and TSINGKE BIOTECH has now achieved the entire industry chain covering from oligonucleotide
                        monomer
                        preparation to
                        primer synthesis and gene synthesis, and will strictly abide by relevant national laws and
                        regulations
                        as well as
                        business ethics, ensuring the quality and safety of each primer from raw materials to delivery
                        process.
                        
                        The fruitful research process soon came to an end. Ir. Chen and Mr. Hao arranged the vehicles
                        considerately to send
                        us back and welcomed us to continue to carry out Human Practice at TSINGKE BIOTECH. </H5></DIV><DIV id="con5" class="section scrollspy" style="padding-top:30px"><DIV class="center" style="padding-top: 50px;"><H4>

                        Obtained the affirmation and encouragement from Dr. Du on our project; 

                        Acquired the suggestion from Dr. Du that we should employ an E. coli chassis that knocks out
                        homologous
                        recombination systems to reduce erroneous rearrangement of genomic fragments. </H5><H5><B>Text:</B></H5><H5>
                        Our trace journey of artificial life in Beijing TSINGKE Biotech allowed us to grasp the
                        standard
                        process of primer
                        synthesis. Previously, TACG BioTech had explained the process and principles of conventional
                        gene
                        synthesis. We are
                        equally curious as to how commercial gene synthesis works. In order to better understand the
                        field
                        of
                        gene
                        synthesis
                        in a more integrated way, we came to GENERAL BIOSYSTEM (Anhui) Co., Ltd. </H5><H5 style="padding-top: 20px;">
                        Dr. Du Pan, Minister of Department of Gene Synthesis, led us to visit their molecular probe
                        production
                        workshop,
                        conventional primer synthesis workshop and gene synthesis workshop. During the visit, we
                        learned
                        that
                        the process
                        of
                        industrial gene synthesis is to first design and synthesize primers with complementary
                        sequences,
                        and
                        then use PCR
                        to combine multiple primers to amplify a double-stranded DNA fragment, and finally sequence the
                        correctness of the
                        synthesized DNA. Usually this cycle takes around a week. Plus, he also compared the current gap
                        between
                        China and
                        the world in the field of commercial gene synthesis: gene synthesis companies represented by
                        TWIST
                        have
                        implemented
                        chip-based high-throughput primer and gene synthesis, reducing the cost of primers to 1
                        cents/bp,
                        while
                        currently
                        Chinese companies can decrease the cost to an extreme of around 3 cents/bp. At present, China's
                        gene
                        synthesis
                        industry is overly dependent on human labor, nonetheless, there are already automated gene
                        synthesis
                        workshops in
                        foreign countries. Dr. Du told us that although they are now building an automated gene
                        synthesis
                        platform, there
                        is
                        still a long way to go before the realization of actual production.
                    </H5><H5 style="padding-top: 20px;">
                        At the end of our visit, we introduced them to our project --- design and synthesis of the
                        minimal
                        mitochondrial
                        genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Dr. Du praised us for our courage to take the challenge of
                        splicing
                        complex
                        mitochondrial genes. He thought that if we should succeed, it would be a positive
                        demonstration.
                        
                        Moreover, we also consulted Dr. Du about the difficulty of splicing fragments with low GC
                        content.
                        Dr.
                        Du professed
                        that the high AT regions of the genome are often the ones where gene segments are rearranged.
                        Hence, He
                        advised
                        that
                        we use the E. coli chassis, such as E.coli GXL-10 strain, which knocks out the homologous
                        recombination
                        system, to
                        reduce the probability of mistaken recombination of the genome segments.

                        We know that synthesizing a genome is not as simple as typing a code, so where does its
                        technical
                        difficulty lie?
                        What are the existing gene synthesis technologies? With these questions we came to TACG
                        Biotech.
                        
                        Peng Kai, CTO of TACG Biotech, told us that the current process of a complete synthesis from
                        bases
                        to
                        genomes is
                        actually more like building blocks, rather than inputting word by word like writing as what
                        many
                        people
                        may think.
                        Gene synthesis is like building blocks, and Oligo is the smallest unit, which is chemically
                        synthesized
                        and bears
                        the length of up to 250 bp (usually 60 bp to 90 bp). Usually it can be spliced into gene
                        fragments
                        of
                        about 1 Kbp
                        in
                        one time in vitro, then the next round proceeds. The traditional fusion PCR, TA cloning, and
                        the
                        newly-minted
                        emergence of Gibson Assembly, CPEC, in vitro homologous recombination and DATEL in the past 10
                        years
                        have provided
                        a
                        variety of options for this process, greatly reducing the synthetic difficulty of the
                        conventional
                        kb-level genes.
                        However, large-scale gene synthesis over 10K usually relies on the recombination and cloning
                        system
                        of
                        the model
                        chassis in order to obtain a better splicing effect. Therefore, how to obtain longer Oligos
                        with
                        lower
                        cost in the
                        preliminary stage and achieve large-scale gene fragment assembly with high efficiency in the
                        future
                        is
                        a core
                        technical obstacle that restricts the large-scale application of gene synthesis technology. In
                        regard
                        to Oligos
                        synthesis, the high-throughput gene synthesis chip represented by TWIST reduced the synthesis
                        cost
                        of
                        Oligos by ten
                        times, yet the initial synthesis length did not improve. CTO Peng further introduced that in
                        fact,
                        organism itself
                        is the most experienced in gene synthesis, so the bio-enzymatic Oligos gene synthesis
                        technology is
                        expected to
                        achieve cheaper and greener Oligos synthesis with content length and even large-scale gene
                        synthesis.
                        TACG Biotech
                        helped us contact TSINGKE Biotech to explore the source of synthetic genes
                        and GENERAL SYSTEMS to learn more
                        about commercial gene synthesis technology .
                        
                        On top of the above, CTO Peng also introduced us to the most promising applications of current
                        gene
                        synthesis
                        technology, employing DNA as a data storage medium to achieve high-density long-term
                        preservation
                        of
                        data. In
                        theory, only about 1 kilogram of DNA powder is needed to store all the data in the world today,
                        yes,
                        all of it! It
                        is indeed startling! However, due to the high cost of synthesis and the hysteresis of
                        sequencing
                        reads,
                        the
                        technology has not been widely promoted. At present, many companies and research groups in the
                        world
                        are doing
                        related research in this field. The description of CTO Peng inspired us to take the advantage
                        of
                        the
                        utility of DNA
                        storage to make DNA time capsules that store the kids’ dreams. And this was implemented later.

                        </B></H5><H5>
                        There exists a low GC content and a very uneven distribution in the wild-type mitochondrial
                        genome,
                        presenting many
                        GC-rich regions and AT-rich regions, as well as multiple repeat sequences. This is really a
                        disaster
                        for the
                        splicing of the entire genome. Based on their experience, TACG Biotech suggested that we divide
                        the
                        entire gene
                        combination so that the interface sequences between the fragments can be free of these complex
                        sequence
                        regions,
                        thus facilitating subsequent splicing. For the synthesis of these individual fragments, TACG
                        Biotech
                        used the Oligo
                        design software they developed to help us design these Oligos. The technique is to synthesize
                        the
                        longer Oligo
                        containing the complex sequence areas. Of course, there will be some increase in the cost of
                        synthesis,
                        but it is
                        worthwhile.

                        predicament
                        this
                        year, TACG
                        Biotech has generously opened the lab to us, providing us with most of the financial support
                        needed
                        to
                        complete the
                        synthesis. TACG Biotech aided us in synthesizing most of the kb-level fragments, and

                        guided the
                        subsequent integration of the entire genome, which is essential for our whole project.

                        1、 Professor Akihiko Kondo from Kobe University introduced his large-scale multi-segment gene
                        assembly
                        system based
                        on OGAB (Ordered Gene Assembly in B. subtilis). Originally, we had also thought up the idea of
                        employing the OGAB
                        method for genomic splicing. However, since we did not have the experience of molecular cloning
                        experiments of
                        Bacillus subtilis, we finally chose to synthesize the genome thorugh conventional methods. 
                        2、 Dr. Xue Xiaoli from Shanghai Institute of Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences,
                        shared
                        her amazing
                        research achievement. She had successfully assembled the 16 chromosomes of Saccharomyces
                        cerevisiae
                        into a complete
                        circular chromosome, which marks the artificially created new form of life of Saccharomyces
                        cerevisiae.
                        Dr. Xue's
                        research provides us with a positive example that inspires us to challenge the impossible of
                        life
                        and
                        strive to
                        create new life.

                        Researcher Wang Manli from Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, shared her

                        using pGF of a plant virus genome of approximately 145 kbp in length (plasmid of Genome Fast)
                        as

                        positive
                        example for us. Afterwards, we reviewed the literature and thoroughly studied the principle and
                        operation of pGF
                        for
                        genome synthesis, which had laid a solid foundation for us to ultimately achieve complete
                        genome
                        synthesis. The
                        final genetic synthesis protocol we utilized bears a remarkable resemblance to hers.

                        In this conference, nine teams took turns to showcase this year's project.
                        Jilin_China's project this year is also related to gene synthesis. Their modeling this year is
                        absolutely
                        impressive, which interested us to inquir them about their modeling. We also reached an

                        with
                        Jilin

                        the modeling,
                        and Peking University students shared their materials pertaining to modeling. 
                        We have reached an agreement with TUST_China to help them examine water quality. 
                        The SYSU-China presentation has inspired us to investigate the public's understanding of the
                        understanding and
                        recognition of artificial life through questionnaires. 
                        One of TJU-China's four options this year is about treating mitochondrial diseases. We resorted
                        to

                        with regard
                        to the transformation method of mitochondrial genes, and they also generously accorded us with

                        1. In the speech of academician Zhao Guoping, he introduced the development history of life
                        sciences
                        systematically,
                        telling us that life sciences have entered the era of multidisciplinary intersection.

                        technology&quot;,
                        which integrates “bioinformatics”, “big data” and “synthetic biology”, has become the direction
                        of
                        development and
                        an important growth point of life sciences. Academician Zhao Guoping’s speech made us more
                        confident in
                        our
                        participation in this year’s competition, since we have applied &quot;bioinformatics&quot; and &quot;synthetic
                        biology&quot; to design
                        and construct mitochondrial genomes in our project. 
                        2. Researcher Dai Junxi is also a special guest of CCIC. Dr. Dai is a leading scientist in the
                        field of
                        genomics in

                        similar to those of ours in the past few months when we had to solve various unforeseeable
                        problems
                        every day. This
                        sort of empathy gave us a deeper understanding that genomic design and synthesis is very tough,
                        yet
                        Dr.
                        Dai's role
                        model has prodigiously inspired us to continue our exploration. 
                        3. Dr. Dai also comprehensively introduced us to the development of gene synthesis technology,
                        showing
                        us the great
                        process of scientists’ synthesizing from thousands of bp of viral genes to the realization of
                        millions
                        of bp of
                        yeast chromosome, which, to a larger extent, has equipped us with a more systematic grasp of
                        the
                        gene
                        synthesis
                        technology, bolstering the layout of our “Bigger Picture”. 
                        4. After the speech of Dr. Dai, we exchanged and discussed with him. He held a very optimistic
                        attitude
                        towards the
                        innovation and application prospects of our project. He also reminded us with his own
                        experience of
                        that the
                        challenge of what we are doing remains enormous. The difficulty of the project might accrue as
                        our
                        experiments
                        proceed. He suggested that we speed up the experiment process and finish the experiment before
                        Giant
                        Jamboree,
                        indeed giving us a sense of urgency but inspiring us to strive for better solutions.

                        Before we partook in CCiC, we encountered a very serious problem in the experiment. The genome
                        assembled in yeast
                        was difficult to extract enough concentration of genes needed for sequencing verification due
                        to
                        the
                        low copy
                        number
                        of the plasmids. In the Q&amp;A session after CCIC's presentation, we resorted to Dr. Guo
                        Yutian
                        for
                        his
                        consultancy,
                        one of the judges for the session. He suggested that we directly increase the volume of the
                        yeast
                        solution used to
                        extract the plasmid, and then concentrate the extracted plasmids with low concentration to
                        obtain
                        sufficient
                        plasmids entailed by sequencing.

                        CCIC highly simulates the process of Giant Jamboree, providing us with a precious opportunity
                        to
                        exercise our
                        presentation and poster demonstration. 
                        2. During the poster display, adviser of PKU-China, Li Cheng, suggested that we add the
                        necessary
                        textual
                        explanations in the poster to help the audience understand the contents. He also reminded us to
                        pay
                        attention to
                        the
                        academic display specifications of the icons, so as to improve the display of the contents. 
                        3. In the course of communicating with other teams, we gathered some puzzlements about their
                        projects.
                        For
                        instance,
                        is it possible to improve the GC content and reduce the difficulty of splicing by codon
                        optimization of
                        the whole
                        genome? What is the formation mechanism of mitochondrial organelle membrane? These questions
                        have
                        helped us further
                        boost the integrity of the collected materials and accumulate knowledge for the Q&amp;A during
                        the
                        GJ
                        presentation.
                        
                        4. The CCIC Organizing Committee also gave us feedback with particular reference to our
                        project,
                        suggesting that we
                        elaborate the project background and plans for how to verify the genome function in the future.
