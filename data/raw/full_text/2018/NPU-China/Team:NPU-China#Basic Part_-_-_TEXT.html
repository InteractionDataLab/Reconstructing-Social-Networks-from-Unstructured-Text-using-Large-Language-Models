cob (BBa_K2707004)
cob encode cytochrome b in mitochondrion.
Component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex (complex III or cytochrome b-c1 complex) that is part of    the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The b-c1 complex mediates electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c.    Contributes to the generation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane that is then used for ATP    synthesis.
var1 (BBa_K2707008)
var1 encode ribosomal protein in mitochondrion.
Component of the mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome), a dedicated translation machinery responsible for the    synthesis of mitochondrial genome-encoded proteins, including at least some of the essential transmembrane subunits    of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The mitoribosomes are attached to the mitochondrial inner membrane and    translation products are cotranslationally integrated into the membrane . uS3m is essential for mitochondrial    protein synthesis and required for the maturation of small ribosomal subunits .
cox1 (BBa_K2707001) cox2 (BBa_K2707002) cox3 (BBa_K2707003)
cox1 cox2 cox3 encode the components of Cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondrion
Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water.
Catalytic activity:
4 ferrocytochrome c + O2 + 4 H+ = 4 ferricytochrome c + 2 H2O.
Subunits 1-3 form the functional core of the enzyme complex. CO I is the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. Electrons    originating in cytochrome c are transferred via the copper A center of subunit 2 and heme A of subunit 1 to the    bimetallic center formed by heme A3 and copper B. Subunit 2 transfers the electrons from cytochrome c via its    binuclear copper A center to the bimetallic center of the catalytic subunit 1.
Pathway : oxidative phosphorylation
atp6 (BBa_K2707006) atp8 (BBa_K2707005) atp9 (BBa_K2707000)
atp6 atp8 atp9 encode 3 subunits of ATPase respectively.
Mitochondria membrane ATP synthase (F1F0 ATP synthase or Complex V) produces ATP from ADP in    the presence of a    proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain.    F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F1 - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core and    F0 -    containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis,    ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F1 is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk    subunits to    proton translocation. As the key component of the proton channel; atp6 may play a direct role in the translocation    of protons across the membrane. As atp8 is the part of the complex F0 domain, minor subunit located with    subunit a    in the membrane. As atp9 is the part of the complex F0 domain, a homomeric c-ring of probably 10 subunits    is part of    the complex rotary element.
