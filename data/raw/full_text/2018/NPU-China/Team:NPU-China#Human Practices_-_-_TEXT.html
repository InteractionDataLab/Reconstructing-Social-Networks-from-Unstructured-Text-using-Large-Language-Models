Human Practices overview
Our project this year is to simplify the sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae                         mitochondrial                         genome                         and achieve de novo synthesis. This topic is completely removed from our previous entries, and                         it                         is a                         totally blank                         area for us to explore. Therefore, there are four “Bigger Pictures” that we are enormously                         curious                         about                         and yearn                         to know:
Safety is always the first. Does our subject comply with the relevant laws and regulations? Is                         our                         subject                         within                         the security framework of the iGEM Organizing Committee? How do experts in this field view the                         safety                         of                         “artificial                         life”?
Objectives and significance count. Is this an innovative yet meaningful exploration? Can the                         project                         provide a                         reference or research basis for the further study in related fields, such as artificial life                         research,                         mitochondrial                         research, gene synthesis, etc.?
We do not need to understand the background knowledge of mitochondria, including genetic                         background,                         recent                         research                         progress, etc.
It is imperative for us to understand the technology of gene synthesis, including technological                         evolution,                         the                         latest research progress, mature commercial applications and so forth.

The following is a brief summary of our achievements of these four aspects that we have learned                         from                         the                         above                         exchanges and activities:
1.Bigger Picture of Safety:
We learned about China's genetically modified regulatory system, evaluation system and the laws                         and                         regulations                         pertaining to the research or commercial promotion of genetically modified gene from the speech                         by                         Mr.                         Zhang Xianfa,                         Deputy Secretary General of the National Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms Safety                         Management                         Standardization Technical Committee and Deputy Director of the Department of Genetically                         Modified                         Biosafety                         and                         Intellectual Property of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of                         Agriculture.                         [1]
We confirmed that our researches are highly in compliance with relevant national laws and                         regulations.                         Also, we have                         strictly reported the safety-related project information in accordance with the requirements of                         the                         iGEM                         Organizing                         Committee and participated in the safety training of the laboratories. No safety incidents have                         occurred                         since the                         project was launched. (see Safety for details)
We resorted to Jiang Huifeng, a researcher specializing in biocomponent design and chassis                         modification,                         for his                         views on the safety issues of “artificial life”. [2]
Additionally, we were delighted that we happened to learn the GMP standard for medical Oligos                         synthesis                         from TSINKE                         BIOTECH and learned about their work on the strict control of medical primer safety. [3]
2.Bigger Picture of Project Importance：
From the speech by Academician Zhao Guoping, we learned that the “convergence technology” that                         combines                         bioinformatics, big data and synthetic biology is the future direction of development of life                         sciences.                         Being an                         innovative exploration, our project is intricately entwined with bioinformatics and synthetic                         biology.                         [4]
Our project has been unanimously affirmed and encouraged by Researcher Jiang Huifeng [2],                         Professor                         Gu                         Zhenglong                         [5], Researcher Dai Junyi [4], Dr. Du [6], etc. They maintain that our work is a brave                         scientific                         exploration that                         can provide empirical reference and research basis for artificial life research, mitochondrial                         research,                         and gene                         synthesis. Professor Gu Zhenglong [5] even directly proposed his willingness to cooperate with                         us                         for a                         longer time,                         hoping to further expand the research based on our work.
Dr. Xue Xiaoli [1] has set up a positive example for us to create a single-chromosome genome of                         Saccharomyces                         cerevisiae, inspiring us to challenge the impossible of life and strive to create new life.
3.Bigger Picture of Mitochondrial Research：
We contacted Professor Gu Zhenglong, who has long been working on mitochondrial research. Prof.                         Gu                         systematically                         introduced the biological and genetic background of mitochondria, through which we have learned                         about                         the                         important                         effects of mitochondria in cellular aerobic respiration, cancer and multi-gene regulation.                         Today,                         mitochondrial gene                         editing still remains a difficult task, and choosing to re-deliver through the entire genome                         may be                         a                         possible way                         that leads to the discovery of something new. [5]
4.Bigger Picture of Gene (Genome) Synthesis Technology：
Through the communication with Dr. Jiang [2] and the speech by Dr. Dai [4], we learned a lot                         about                         the                         artificial                         life, which was preliminarily a work that only God can achieve. Plus, we also accessed the                         classic                         cases                         where                         small-scale viral genes were synthesized to large-scale Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes.
We learned about OGAB gene synthesis technology from the speech by Professor Akihiko Kondo [1],                         the                         gene                         synthesis                         technology from TACG BioTech system [7], the answer to the "source of artificial life" from                         TSINGKE                         BioTech. [3],                         and the commercial application mode of gene synthesis technology from GENERAL BIOSYSTEMS [6]
Furthermore, we have gained a new perspective on DNA and life in the course of DNA Time Capsule                         activity.                         [10]
These exchanges and activities portrayed for us the complete “Bigger Pictures” that are                             directly                             or                             indirectly                             related to our project, which has greatly expanded our vision of the project and imparted                             us                             with                             substantially                             important knowledge and left valuable spiritual wealth to us.
Absolutely, what we have harvested from these HP activities is not merely confined to the                             exploration                             of “Bigger                             Picture”, benefitting us even more in the following four aspects:
Objective:
Recommendations from Dr. Jiang on the preferential selection of relatively small mitochondrial                         genomes                         [2]                         and Prof.                         Gu's introduction of the importance of mitochondria in life activities in eukaryotes and the                         difficulty                         of                         genetic                         editing [5], as well as other professionals' assessment of our project made us clear about the                         objective of                         our                         project this year: to creatively simplify the design of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae                         mitochondrial                         genome                         and                         achieve de novo synthesis to explore new areas of artificial life for the research on                         artificial life,                         mitochondrial                         and gene synthesis, offering our own experience and laying a foundation for deeper research.
Design:
Dr. Jiang suggested that we use a combination of multi-genome comparisons and homologous                         evolution                         analysis                         to                         figure out the strategy for the simplification of mitochondrial genomes based on existing gene                         annotation                         files. Dr.                         Cheng, a member in the research group of Dr. Jiang, specifically guided us through the design                         of                         the                         entire                         genome.                         [2]
Prof. Gu suggested that we add a GFP reporting module to this minimal genome for visual                         detection                         of                         new                         mitochondrial genome functions. [5]
During the design of experimental schemes, TACG BioTech suggested that we divide the whole                         genome                         so                         that                         the                         interface sequence between each fragment can be free of these complex sequence regions, which                         would                         facilitate                         subsequent splicing.
We referred to the work report of Researcher Wang Manli when the genome splicing encountered                         difficulties                         [1] and                         timely adjusted the experimental design, adding the plasmid replication stability module and                         the                         plasmid                         copy number control module, through which we ultimately realized the complete genome synthesis.
Execution:
TACG BioTech accorded us with a laboratory to carry out the genome synthesis work and                         complimentary                         support                         for the                         completion of the work. [7] TACG Biotech also helped us finish the synthesis of most of the                         kb-level                         primary                         fragments and specifically guided the subsequent synthesis of the entire genome. [7]
Dr. Jiang gave us the access to his laboratory and provided us with some reagent supplies. [2]
Dr. Jiang answered our questions in the mid-term progress of the experiment and gave feedback                         as                         well                         as                         guidance on                         the progress of the experiment and the achievements of the mid-term experiment. There were some                         repetitive                         and                         polluting events occurred in our experiments at that time. Dr. Jiang proposed that we might as                         well                         “return                         to zero”                         in light of the laboratory condition. Moreover, we were also kindly told to lavish due                         attention on                         the                         experimental                         operation and conduct a negative and positive control. [2]
Dr. Guo's experimental advice on extracting plasmids directly from a relatively larger amount                         of                         Saccharomyces                         cerevisiae showed no effect, but the accumulated valuable experience is conducive to the                         further development of our                         experiments. [4]
Ruan Jiangxing from the research group of Dr. Jiang guided our experiments of mitochondrial                         genome                         extraction and                         Saccharomyces cerevisiae rho0 cell preparation. [2] We obtained the important chassis for the                         subsequent S.                         cerevisiae genome transformation.
Prof. Gu was willing to help us with the following genome delivery work and assisted us in                         functional                         verification                         and longer-term functional extension studies based on the minimal genome. [5]
Presentation:
We introduced our project to other teams at CCiC[4], the first iGEM Meetup in Shaanxi [8] and                         iGEM                         Summit                         for Nine                         Universities [9], not merely boosting our oral expression and logical thinking, but also                         accumulating                         valuable                         materials in the question and answer session.
We received specific suggestions on how to improve the display of our poster at CCiC. [4]
We obtained suggestions and feedback with particular reference to our project display from the                         CCiC                         Organizing                         Committee. [4]
Intergrated HP with Prof. Gu
The background research on mitochondrial biology is the focus of our HP. For our project, which                         falls                         into basic                         researches and exploration, consulting senior scholars in related fields is probably the most                         effective                         approach to                         "crossing the threshold". With the help of Dr. Jiang, we contacted Professor Gu Zhenglong of                         Cornell                         University.                         Prof. Gu has long been committed to the function, evolution and correlation of mitochondria.                         Also,                         he                         devotes                         himself to the study of evolution of aerobic fermentation of yeast and the effects of this                         process                         on                         the                         physiology and multi-gene regulation of complex diseases such as cancer.
We have had an in-depth interaction with Prof. Gu in several substantial aspects, which are                         respectively project                         objectives and background research, genome design, project experimentation and subsequent                         genome                         delivery. And                         Prof. Gu indeed provided us with exceedingly valuable and specific advice and support.
Objectives and background:
We consulted Prof. Gu on the academic significance and possible specific applications of                         simplifying                         the                         mitochondrial genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its de novo synthesis, and he was quite                         pleased to                         learn that                         we were designing and synthesizing the minimal mitochondrial genome. He positively confirmed                         the                         remarkable                         significance of our project, maintaining that the simplified design of the mitochondrial genome                         and                         its                         de novo                         synthesis are, till now, a field that entails further exploration. Chances are great that the                         research                         like this                         will provide a new engineered idea for the study of mitochondrial genes and their functions, as                         well as                         the                         treatment of diseases related to mitochondria. There is a high possibility to create a minimal                         model                         chassis,                         providing a new yet reliable reference for the researches in relevant fields.
Prof. Gu further said that with regard to mitochondrial research, the current method is only to                         knock                         out or add                         some certain genes. However, even such seemingly simple requirements have high operational                         difficulty                         in practical                         experiments. Even with the Crispr-Cas9 method, rapid and simple gene editing will not be that                         easy.                         On                         the one                         hand,                         it is difficult to express Cas9 protein in mitochondria, yet the use of a guide peptide to                         deliver                         Cas9                         protein in                         cytoplasm is also not satisfactory. On the other hand, the difficulty of screening caused by                         multiple                         copies of                         mitochondria results in a low success rate at the same time.
It is a very convenient way to use the characteristics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that it can                         survive                         in a                         reducing                         carbon source medium in the absence of a mitochondrial genome to deliver the entire de novo                         synthesized                         genome                         directly into the mitochondrial membrane. Of course, this also requires high-quality genomic                         DNA                         and                         efficient                         delivery methods.
Prof. Gu professed that he had long had plans to do this work. He has unique experience and                         skills                         in                         mitochondrial                         genome delivery technology, and we were more than glad that he expressed his willingness to                         offer                         us                         technical                         support in the late genome delivery.
Genomic design:
In designing the minimal S. cerevisiae mitochondrial genome, Prof. Gu suggested that we add a                         GFP                         reporter module                         to                         this minimal genome, which should make it easier to know if the genome's transcriptional                         translation                         system is                         working properly and also more vivid to display the results, rendering the project fancier.
Progress of experiments:
In the splicing process of genomic fragments, we encountered a serious problem, which was the                         spliced                         plasmids                         showed irregular base mutation or fragment loss. We thus consulted Prof. Gu for possible causes                         and                         solutions.
Prof. Gu shared with us his previous experimental experience, where he constructed the human                         mitochondrial genome                         into E. coli vector and transferred it into E. coli, and similar random mutations and fragment                         loss                         also occurred.                         He speculated that the reason might be the content of A and T bases in the mitochondrial genome                         is                         too                         high (about                         85%), leading to the failure of balance of four nucleotides and the death of cells. Based on                         this                         experience, we                         adjusted the experimental protocol and used a low-copy vector to lay the foundation for the                         splicing of                         the genome                         that finally succeeded. The interaction with Prof. Gu allows us to have new solutions to the                         experimental problems                         we encountered.
Genome delivery and functional verification in the future work:
Prof. Gu expressed his willingness to help us with the following genome delivery and to assist                         us                         in                         functional                         verification and long-term functional extensions based on minimal genomes. The interaction and                         cooperation with                         Prof. Gu have laid a vitally crucial foundation for us to continue to improve our entire                         project.
Integrated HP with Dr. Jiang and his group
This year our project is to design and synthesize a minimal S. cerevisiae mitochondrial genome.                         As                         a                         basic study,                         we                         believe that it is very important to seek advice from professionals. Therefore, we have                         conducted                         detailed and                         extensive exchanges with Prof. Jiang Huifeng and his research group from Tianjin Institute of                         Industrial                         Biotechnology. We have obtained the full advice and support from Dr. Jiang and his research                         group                         for                         our project                         research, design and experimental development.
Dr. Jiang Huifeng, Deputy Director of the Key Laboratory of Systematic Microbial Engineering,                         Chinese                         Academy of                         Sciences and a researcher in Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of                         Sciences. Dr. Jiang                         focuses on the identification and design of novel biological parts. By combining omics                         technology                         and                         synthetic                         biology, he has developed new platforms to dig new genes for producing plant natural compounds                         and to                         design novel                         enzymes for one-carbon utilization.
Project research in the early period:
During the investigation of the previous project, we consulted Dr. Jiang about the most                         important                         research topic of                         synthetic biology in “Simplified Design and Synthesis of Life”. Dr. Jiang first briefed for us                         on                         the                         Syn1.0-Syn3.0                         project that top scientists such as Craig Venter and Gibson have been devoted into, which                         centers                         around                         simplifying                         the design and de novo synthesis of the mycoplasma genome and achieving the breakthrough of                         artificially creating                         the simplest living body. We also learned the rapid development of genome synthesis technology                         in                         recent years,                         including the synthesis of artificial genome synthesis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and E. coli.                         Dr.                         Jiang suggested                         we study the mitochondrial genome starting with a smaller genome size. On the one hand, there                         is no                         precedent for                         simplifying the design of mitochondrial genome and synthesizing it from the beginning. Such                         research                         bears a                         positive scientific exploration significance and can also provide some reference for the                         research                         of                         the simplest life design, mitochondrial research and etc. On the other hand, the mitochondrial genome scale                         is                         relatively small,                         with only several Ks. Compared with other living organism genomes, the synthesis cost and cycle                         are                         more                         advantageous, making the project more tangible. Dr. Jiang expressed his willingness to help us                         in                         genome design and                         synthesis. Additionally, Dr. Jiang also assisted us in contacting Professor Gu Zhenglong of                         Cornell                         University, who                         has long been committed to the study of the relationship between mitochondrial gene and                         function                         and                         basic                         researches on mitochondrial diseases.
After the exchange, we also had some exchanges with Nankai University, where we discussed the                         projects                         with each                         other this year. Our advisers gave them some suggestions for the competition.
What is more, we also consulted Dr. Jiang about the safety of artificially designed life. The                         "Pandora                         Box" effect                         that synthetic biotechnology may bring is a constant concern of the scientific community as                         well as                         the                         society.                         Dr. Jiang first affirmed our concern about this issue. He believes that this is a problem that all                         researchers need to                         consider. After all, our understanding of nature is still not comprehensive. There are always                         such                         defects in the                         researches based on experimental science, requiring researchers to seriously abide by the                         existing                         laws                         and                         regulations and conduct scientific research and exploration in the existing framework. Dr.                         Jiang                         also                         pointed out                         that blind panic was not necessary and the further study should not be therefore foregone.                         Safety                         should be judged                         according to the content of different research projects, rather than denied regardless.
Project design:
In the course of designing the minimal mitochondrial genome, Dr. Jiang suggested that we use                         the                         existing gene                         annotation files combined with multi-genomic comparison and homologous evolution analysis to                         determine                         the                         importance of the genes in the wild-type S. cerevisiae mitochondrial genome. He assigned Dr.                         Cheng                         Jian, who is                         responsible for the calculation of biological information in his research group, to guide us                         through                         the design of                         the entire genome. (see Design & Model for specific design).
Experiments:
During the process of genome synthesis, Dr. Jiang assigned his master student, Qi Jiangxing, to                         guide                         us on the                         extraction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial genome and the preparation of                         Saccharomyces                         cerevisiae rho0                         cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae that lost the mitochondrial genome). He gave us the access to                         their                         lab                         and                         provided                         us with some experimental reagent supplies.
Project progress and advice:
In the middle of the summer break, Dr. Jiang made a mid-term progress consultation for                         NKU-China                         and                         our team, and                         gave feedback and guidance on the progress and results of the mid-term experiment. There were                         some                         repetitive and                         polluting problems in our experiments at that time, thus Dr. Jiang suggested that we might as                         well                         “return to zero”                         for the lab, pay attention to the experimental operation and carry out a negative and positive                         control.

The essence of artificial life is to artificially design and                         synthesize                         the genome                         of a living body. Then, as for the synthesis of genes, what do we use as raw materials? And how                         to                         synthesize?                         These                         are a technical background that is closely related to our project. In other words, where is the                         source                         of                         artificial                         life? With this kind of philosophy question, which is also the core issue of life sciences, we                         paid                         a                         visit to                         TSINGKE BIOTECH in Beijing to conduct a project survey and expand our “Bigger Picture” layout                         with                         the                         introduction                         of TACG BioTech.
Mr. Chen Yuntao, Director of the Primer Synthesis Workshop of TSINGKE BIOTECH, and Mr. Hao Yun,                         Marketing Manager,                         warmly received us.
Ir. Chen first introduced the synthesis of primers, which every student who has done molecular                         cloning                         has been                         exposed to. On the alkali-treated silicon-based surface, the protecting group-modified                         deoxyribonucleotides                         underwent a controlled addition of chemical "protection and deprotection" cycles, ultimately                         forming                         Oligos with a                         length of 15 bp to 250 bp. Ir. Chen then led us to visit their standard primer synthesis                         workshop,                         where more than                         20 different models of the Oligos synthesizer in the gigantic workshop kept writing the book of                         life                         like a printer                         --- Oligos. He took us to one of their independently developed Oligos synthesizer with 192                         flux,                         picking up a                         bottle                         containing oligonucleotide monomers and proudly said to us, "This is the answer to your                         research."                         Before our                         departure, we took a photo with Ir. Chen with the four monomers A, T, C, and G that can be used                         to                         write the book                         of life. It is conceivable that in the following 24 hours, these raw materials will be synthesized                         into                         primers and                         sent to researchers all over the country to write a grand blueprint for workers devoted into                         life                         sciences.                         Whenever                         we think of this scene, it is difficult for us to hide our excitement and ecstasy.
the “source of artificial life” --- deoxyoligonucleotide monomer
Ir. Chen continued to introduce us to the whole process of primer synthesis - ammonia                         hydrolysis -                         initial                         inspection - purification - quality inspection - lyophilization. He took a tube of yellow                         material                         from                         a primer                         lyophilizer, saying “this is the primer that you usually use". It was the first time for us to                         see                         the                         primers in                         person, which was an absolutely unexpected startling surprise. Ir. Chen explained to us that in                         this                         small test                         tube, there were Oligos with a number of tens of thousands of OD, which were tailored to our                         big                         customers, which                         indeed impressed us a lot.
After visiting the standard primer synthesis workshop, Ir. Chen also showed us around their GMP                         standard primer                         synthesis workshop, which is mainly used for the synthesis of Oligo probes for synthetic                         disease                         diagnosis. The GMP                         standard is a quality management standard that all medical drug synthesis processes in China                         need                         to                         strictly abide                         by. We didn't expect that even simple primers also had medical safety requirements, which once                         again                         expanded our                         "Bigger Picture" layout. We hold the firm belief that with the advancement of technology,                         genetic                         editing                         technologies like Crispr in the future will have substantive applications. So how does TSINGKE                         BIOTECH                         ensure the                         safety of the primers used in this process? Ir. Chen told us that they have been also paying                         attention                         to this                         issue                         and TSINGKE BIOTECH has now achieved the entire industry chain covering from oligonucleotide                         monomer                         preparation to                         primer synthesis and gene synthesis, and will strictly abide by relevant national laws and                         regulations                         as well as                         business ethics, ensuring the quality and safety of each primer from raw materials to delivery                         process.
The fruitful research process soon came to an end. Ir. Chen and Mr. Hao arranged the vehicles                         considerately to send                         us back and welcomed us to continue to carry out Human Practice at TSINGKE BIOTECH.

Our trace journey of artificial life in Beijing TSINGKE Biotech allowed us to grasp the                         standard                         process of primer                         synthesis. Previously, TACG BioTech had explained the process and principles of conventional gene                         synthesis. We are                         equally curious as to how commercial gene synthesis works. In order to better understand the                         field                         of                         gene                         synthesis                         in a more integrated way, we came to GENERAL BIOSYSTEM (Anhui) Co., Ltd.
Dr. Du Pan, Minister of Department of Gene Synthesis, led us to visit their molecular probe                         production                         workshop,                         conventional primer synthesis workshop and gene synthesis workshop. During the visit, we                         learned                         that                         the process                         of                         industrial gene synthesis is to first design and synthesize primers with complementary                         sequences,                         and                         then use PCR                         to combine multiple primers to amplify a double-stranded DNA fragment, and finally sequence the                         correctness of the                         synthesized DNA. Usually this cycle takes around a week. Plus, he also compared the current gap                         between                         China and                         the world in the field of commercial gene synthesis: gene synthesis companies represented by                         TWIST                         have                         implemented                         chip-based high-throughput primer and gene synthesis, reducing the cost of primers to 1                         cents/bp,                         while                         currently                         Chinese companies can decrease the cost to an extreme of around 3 cents/bp. At present, China's                         gene                         synthesis                         industry is overly dependent on human labor, nonetheless, there are already automated gene                         synthesis                         workshops in                         foreign countries. Dr. Du told us that although they are now building an automated gene                         synthesis                         platform, there                         is                         still a long way to go before the realization of actual production.
At the end of our visit, we introduced them to our project --- design and synthesis of the                         minimal                         mitochondrial                         genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Dr. Du praised us for our courage to take the challenge of                         splicing                         complex                         mitochondrial genes. He thought that if we should succeed, it would be a positive                         demonstration.
Moreover, we also consulted Dr. Du about the difficulty of splicing fragments with low GC                         content. Dr.                         Du professed                         that the high AT regions of the genome are often the ones where gene segments are rearranged.                         Hence, He                         advised                         that                         we use the E. coli chassis, such as E.coli GXL-10 strain, which knocks out the homologous                         recombination                         system, to                         reduce the probability of mistaken recombination of the genome segments.
Integrated HP with TACG Biotech
Gene synthesis technology research:
We know that synthesizing a genome is not as simple as typing a code, so where does its                         technical                         difficulty lie?                         What are the existing gene synthesis technologies? With these questions we came to TACG                         Biotech.
Peng Kai, CTO of TACG Biotech, told us that the current process of a complete synthesis from                         bases                         to                         genomes is                         actually more like building blocks, rather than inputting word by word like writing as what                         many                         people                         may think.                         Gene synthesis is like building blocks, and Oligo is the smallest unit, which is chemically synthesized                         and bears                         the length of up to 250 bp (usually 60 bp to 90 bp). Usually it can be spliced into gene                         fragments                         of                         about 1 Kbp                         in                         one time in vitro, then the next round proceeds. The traditional fusion PCR, TA cloning, and                         the                         newly-minted                         emergence of Gibson Assembly, CPEC, in vitro homologous recombination and DATEL in the past 10                         years                         have provided                         a                         variety of options for this process, greatly reducing the synthetic difficulty of the                         conventional                         kb-level genes.                         However, large-scale gene synthesis over 10K usually relies on the recombination and cloning                         system                         of                         the model                         chassis in order to obtain a better splicing effect. Therefore, how to obtain longer Oligos                         with                         lower                         cost in the                         preliminary stage and achieve large-scale gene fragment assembly with high efficiency in the                         future                         is                         a core                         technical obstacle that restricts the large-scale application of gene synthesis technology. In                         regard                         to Oligos                         synthesis, the high-throughput gene synthesis chip represented by TWIST reduced the synthesis                         cost                         of                         Oligos by ten                         times, yet the initial synthesis length did not improve. CTO Peng further introduced that in                         fact, organism itself                         is the most experienced in gene synthesis, so the bio-enzymatic Oligos gene synthesis                         technology is                         expected to                         achieve cheaper and greener Oligos synthesis with content length and even large-scale gene                         synthesis.                         TACG Biotech                         helped us contact TSINGKE Biotech to explore the source of synthetic genes and GENERAL SYSTEMS to learn more                         about commercial gene synthesis technology .
On top of the above, CTO Peng also introduced us to the most promising applications of current                         gene                         synthesis                         technology, employing DNA as a data storage medium to achieve high-density long-term                         preservation                         of                         data. In                         theory, only about 1 kilogram of DNA powder is needed to store all the data in the world today,                         yes,                         all of it! It                         is indeed startling! However, due to the high cost of synthesis and the hysteresis of                         sequencing                         reads,                         the                         technology has not been widely promoted. At present, many companies and research groups in the                         world                         are doing                         related research in this field. The description of CTO Peng inspired us to take the advantage                         of                         the                         utility of DNA                         storage to make DNA time capsules that store the kids’ dreams. And this was implemented later.                         (DNA                         time capsule                         link)
Genome mosaic scheme design:
There exists a low GC content and a very uneven distribution in the wild-type mitochondrial                         genome,                         presenting many                         GC-rich regions and AT-rich regions, as well as multiple repeat sequences. This is really a                         disaster                         for the                         splicing of the entire genome. Based on their experience, TACG Biotech suggested that we divide                         the                         entire gene                         combination so that the interface sequences between the fragments can be free of these complex                         sequence                         regions,                         thus facilitating subsequent splicing. For the synthesis of these individual fragments, TACG                         Biotech                         used the Oligo                         design software they developed to help us design these Oligos. The technique is to synthesize                         the                         longer Oligo                         containing the complex sequence areas. Of course, there will be some increase in the cost of                         synthesis,                         but it is                         worthwhile.
Genome synthesis：
Genome synthesis is a study that entails plenty of funds. After learning our financial                         predicament                         this                         year, TACG                         Biotech has generously opened the lab to us, providing us with most of the financial support                         needed                         to                         complete the                         synthesis. TACG Biotech aided us in synthesizing most of the kb-level fragments, and                         specifically                         guided the                         subsequent integration of the entire genome, which is essential for our whole project.
TACG Biotech conveyed their continuous support on gene synthesis for our next year's                         competition.

Background and significance:
1、 Professor Akihiko Kondo from Kobe University introduced his large-scale multi-segment gene                         assembly                         system based                         on OGAB (Ordered Gene Assembly in B. subtilis). Originally, we had also thought up the idea of                         employing the OGAB                         method for genomic splicing. However, since we did not have the experience of molecular cloning                         experiments of                         Bacillus subtilis, we finally chose to synthesize the genome thorugh conventional methods.
2、 Dr. Xue Xiaoli from Shanghai Institute of Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences,                         shared                         her amazing                         research achievement. She had successfully assembled the 16 chromosomes of Saccharomyces                         cerevisiae                         into a complete                         circular chromosome, which marks the artificially created new form of life of Saccharomyces                         cerevisiae.                         Dr. Xue's                         research provides us with a positive example that inspires us to challenge the impossible of                         life                         and strive to                         create new life.
Project design and execution:
Researcher Wang Manli from Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, shared her                         de                         novo                         synthesis                         using pGF of a plant virus genome of approximately 145 kbp in length (plasmid of Genome Fast)                         as                         well                         as the                         creation of a controllable plant virus with normal function for biocontrol of pests. R. Wang                         also                         sets                         up a                         positive                         example for us. Afterwards, we reviewed the literature and thoroughly studied the principle and                         operation of pGF                         for                         genome synthesis, which had laid a solid foundation for us to ultimately achieve complete                         genome                         synthesis. The                         final genetic synthesis protocol we utilized bears a remarkable resemblance to hers.
Biosafety:
The forum also invited Mr. Zhang Xianfa, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Agricultural                         Genetically                         Modified Organisms Safety Management Standardization Technical Committee, Deputy Director of                         the                         Department of                         Genetically Modified Biosafety and Intellectual Property of the Department of Science and                         Education                         of                         the Ministry                         of Agriculture, to introduce the regulatory system and evaluation system of genetically                         modified                         organisms in                         China,                         especially the market access for genetically modified microbial products. Thanks to the                         briefing of                         Mr.                         Zhang, we                         got to know that the current regulations on genetic modification in China is Safety Management                         of                         Agricultural                         Genetically Modified Organisms. We have carefully reviewed the specific articles on the safety                         of                         genetically                         modified organisms in the Regulation and confirmed that our project this year is in compliance                         with                         the                         Regulation.
Note: Numerous relevant cases and techniques in the two-day forum had indeed impressed                         us                         egregiously.                         Although most                         of them were not fully digested, yet they provided us with thinking wires that guide us to                         optimize                         our                         project                         design and implementation.
Briefing on the Forum: Young scholars are the backbone and new force in the field of synthetic                         biology.

Process and harvest:
In this conference, nine teams took turns to showcase this year's project.                         Jilin_China's project this year is also related to gene synthesis. Their modeling this year is                         absolutely                         impressive, which interested us to inquir them about their modeling. We also reached an                         agreement                         with                         Jilin                         University to help them complete the mini-interlab project [along with the link to the mini-lab                         page of                         this year's                         Jilin University.
Under the recommendation of Jilin University, we, too, consulted the Peking iGEM 2018 students                         about the modeling,                         and Peking University students shared their materials pertaining to modeling.
We have reached an agreement with TUST_China to help them examine water quality.
The SYSU-China presentation has inspired us to investigate the public's understanding of the                         understanding and                         recognition of artificial life through questionnaires.
One of TJU-China's four options this year is about treating mitochondrial diseases. We resorted                         to                         them                         with regard                         to the transformation method of mitochondrial genes, and they also generously accorded us with                         useful                         information                         about the mitochondrial genome editing that they had previously investigated.

Objectives:
1. Seeking for advice from other teams on the design, implementation and display of our                         projects,                         thus                         bolstering                         our presentation;
2. Simulating Giant Jamboree, thus preparing for the competition;
3. Acquiring information of the contents and progress of other teams’ projects;
4. Searching for cooperation with other participants.
Process
CCIC virtually simulates the process of Giant Jamboree, with judges scoring, questioning and                         poster                         presentations.                         We showcased our project this year - MitoCRAFT: Designing and synthesizing the minimal                         Saccharomyces                         cerevisiae                         mitochondrial genome and communicated with other teams during the poster presentations.
CCIC this year has invited experts and scholars in the field of synthetic biology, including                         academician Zhao                         Guoping and researcher Dai Junxi. We elevated the affirmation and suggestions of the                         significance                         and                         the                         background                         of our project from the exchanges their speeches.

Background extension and assessment:
1. In the speech of academician Zhao Guoping, he introduced the development history of life                         sciences                         systematically,                         telling us that life sciences have entered the era of multidisciplinary intersection.                         "Convergence                         technology",                         which integrates “bioinformatics”, “big data” and “synthetic biology”, has become the direction                         of                         development and                         an important growth point of life sciences. Academician Zhao Guoping’s speech made us more                         confident in                         our                         participation in this year’s competition, since we have applied "bioinformatics" and "synthetic                         biology" to design                         and construct mitochondrial genomes in our project.
2. Researcher Dai Junxi is also a special guest of CCIC. Dr. Dai is a leading scientist in the                         field of                         genomics in                         China, obtaining outstanding achievements in the design and synthesis of Saccharomyces                         cerevisiae                         genomes. Dr. Dai                         shared with us his frustrating experience in the research of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomes,                         which                         were quite                         similar to those of ours in the past few months when we had to solve various unforeseeable                         problems                         every day. This                         sort of empathy gave us a deeper understanding that genomic design and synthesis is very tough,                         yet                         Dr.                         Dai's role                         model has prodigiously inspired us to continue our exploration.

Dr. Dai also comprehensively introduced us to the development of gene synthesis technology,                         showing                         us the great                         process of scientists’ synthesizing from thousands of bp of viral genes to the realization of                         millions                         of bp of                         yeast chromosome, which, to a larger extent, has equipped us with a more systematic grasp of                         the                         gene                         synthesis                         technology, bolstering the layout of our “Bigger Picture”.
4. After the speech of Dr. Dai, we exchanged and discussed with him. He held a very optimistic                         attitude                         towards the                         innovation and application prospects of our project. He also reminded us with his own                         experience of                         that the                         challenge of what we are doing remains enormous. The difficulty of the project might accrue as                         our                         experiments                         proceed. He suggested that we speed up the experiment process and finish the experiment before                         Giant                         Jamboree,                         indeed giving us a sense of urgency but inspiring us to strive for better solutions.
Project execution:
Before we partook in CCiC, we encountered a very serious problem in the experiment. The genome                         assembled in yeast                         was difficult to extract enough concentration of genes needed for sequencing verification due                         to                         the                         low copy                         number                         of the plasmids. In the Q&A session after CCIC's presentation, we resorted to Dr. Guo                         Yutian                         for his                         consultancy,                         one of the judges for the session. He suggested that we directly increase the volume of the                         yeast                         solution used to                         extract the plasmid, and then concentrate the extracted plasmids with low concentration to                         obtain                         sufficient                         plasmids entailed by sequencing.
Project display:
CCIC highly simulates the process of Giant Jamboree, providing us with a precious opportunity                         to                         exercise our                         presentation and poster demonstration.
2. During the poster display, adviser of PKU-China, Li Cheng, suggested that we add the                         necessary                         textual                         explanations in the poster to help the audience understand the contents. He also reminded us to                         pay                         attention to                         the                         academic display specifications of the icons, so as to improve the display of the contents.
3. In the course of communicating with other teams, we gathered some puzzlements about their                         projects.                         For                         instance,                         is it possible to improve the GC content and reduce the difficulty of splicing by codon                         optimization of                         the whole                         genome? What is the formation mechanism of mitochondrial organelle membrane? These questions                         have                         helped us further                         boost the integrity of the collected materials and accumulate knowledge for the Q&A during                         the                         GJ                         presentation.
4. The CCIC Organizing Committee also gave us feedback with particular reference to our                         project,                         suggesting that we                         elaborate the project background and plans for how to verify the genome function in the future.
