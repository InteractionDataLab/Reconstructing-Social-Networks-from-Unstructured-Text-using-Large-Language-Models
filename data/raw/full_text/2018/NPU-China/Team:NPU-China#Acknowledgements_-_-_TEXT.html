We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to the following institutions and organizations for their      remarkable assistance for our team.
Northwestern Polytechnical University
Located in the historic city of Xi'an, cradle of Chinese civilization and terminus of the ancient Silk Road,       Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) is the only multidisciplinary and research-oriented in China that is       simultaneously developing education and research programs in the fields of aeronautics, astronautics, and marine       technology engineering. It is now affiliated to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Since       the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC), NPU has always been one of the nation’s key       universities. NPU is a member of the "Outstanding University Alliance" program and is honored as a National Role       Model Unit, a National Pioneer for Optimal Advanced Basic-level Party Organization and a Model University for       Graduate Employment etc. NPU adheres to the motto " Loyalty，Integrity，Courage and Perseverance" while carrying       forward the spirit of " Strong Preparation，Diligent Effort，Practical Attitude，and Creative Innovation". NPU has       put its roots down in the west; dedicated itself to national defense and written several “firsts” into the       history of the PRC. Now NPU will continue to pioneer new pathways into the future in the process of building a       world first-class university and world first-class disciplines.
This year is the 80th anniversary of NPU and       we are grateful for the platforms that NPU provides for us to       pursue technology and science. Hope a brighter future for our Alma Mater.
The International Cooperation Office
The International Cooperation Office of Northwestern Polytechnical University is mainly responsible for the       exchanges and cooperation between Northwestern Polytechnical University and foreign universities or institutes,       involving handling the procedures for the faculty and staff of the whole school who are planned to go abroad for       business, selection of the overseas personnel and the corresponding management during their stay abroad, and the       application check of personnel who go abroad.
We would like to convey our sincere gratitude to the NPU       International Cooperation Office for providing us       with much-needed financial support entailed by partaking in the iGEM competition this year (including previous       years), so that we can focus more on the competition.
The School of Life Science, NPU
The School of Life Science of Northwestern Polytechnical University was established in April 2004. Combining       the characteristics of aviation, aerospace and marine engineering technology education and research that feature       NPU, the school focuses on the research of cutting-edge foundations and applied technologies in the fields of       extreme environmental biology, special molecular medicine and health engineering, as well as biomedical       engineering, including space biology, biomedical materials science, biomedical and bioengineering, molecular       medicine and translational medicine, microbiology and immunology, biomimetic and biomimetic manufacturing       engineering.
Our team members mainly consist of undergraduates of the School of Life Science. We are thankful       for the       School of Life Science for their assistance in our participation of the competition, helping us apply for funding       support and coordinate the preparations for going abroad.
The Academic Affairs Office, NPU
The Academic Affairs Office of Northwestern Polytechnical University is mainly responsible for undergraduate       enrollment, teaching planning and management, educational administration, practical teaching management,       undergraduate teaching quality monitoring and protection, and student registration.
NPU-China is attached to       the iGEM Innovation Base, which is an officially designated base of the Academic       Affairs Office of NPU, providing us with the necessary assistance for the formation and management of our team.
The Ecological and Environmental Research and Protection Center
Established in 2015 and affiliated to the Special Zone for Talents of Northwestern Polytechnical University,       the Ecological and Environmental Research and Protection Center has always regarded the significant historical       mission of human sustainable development in the post-industrial era as the core concern, and combines the       advantages of the science and engineering discipline of NPU, with the intention of striving to develop into an       ecological and environmental scientific research center with strong interdisciplinary and distinctive features.       The Center intersects with existing relevant disciplines in the school, combining ecology and environmental       protection research in life sciences with other disciplines to explore the laws of ecological and environmental       change, as well as human coping strategies, trying to accord the governments, non-profit organizations, etc. with       theoretical basis for decision-making.
The Ecological and Environmental Research and Protection Center offered       the laboratory and related equipment       and reagents consumables for our project this year. The charger of the laboratory also conducted the necessary       safety training along with basic experimental skills training for us, guaranteeing the normal procession of our       experiments.
Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences
The Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology (TIIB-CAS), Chinese Academy of Sciences is a scientific       research institute jointly established by Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Tianjin Municipal People's       Government that engages in biotechnology innovative research to promote the ecological development of the       industrial sector. Tianjin Industrial Biotechnology Institute shoulders the historical mission of establishing       China's industrial biotechnology innovation system and promoting industrial green upgrading. Based on new       biology, with the calculation and design of organisms as the core, TIIB-CAS aims to solve the key problems in the       use of biological functions in industrial development, develop life sciences, and innovate in industrial       organisms, facilitating industrial technology innovation and transformation of results and serving the       sustainable economic and social development of Tianjin, Bohai Rim and the whole China.
Jiang Huifeng       researcher from TIIB has accorded us with great help in this year's competition, aiding us in       identifying the subject or bioinformatics analysis and providing the necessary hardware and software conditions       needed for conducting the experiment. TIIB provided student residences for our team members in Tianjin, and TIIB       teachers also showed us around the BIOINN entrepreneurial space, enabling us to access the information related to       industry, academia and research.
