1.Initiated the first iGEM meet up in Shaanxi Province.
At present, there are three official iGEM teams in Shaanxi Province: NPU-China (our team), XJTU-China, NWU-China.     Having been communicating with XJTU-China and NWU-China on WeChat in the past few months, we felt prodigiously more     and more eager to get together and hold a meetup as time went by. After a month of discussion, at the beginning of     the summer vacation, we three teams jointly held the first iGEM meet up in Shaanxi Province. During the meeting,     the three teams took turns to showcase their projects this year and had further exchange and discussion on team     building. We shared the problems encountered during the project and collectively strived to solve them. The results     of this meetup are as follows:
label We have encountered difficulties in implementing DNA time capsule activities.     XJTU-China expressed their willingness to help us contact Mawu Primary School in Xi’an to enable our DNA time     capsule activity to be carried out smoothly.
label NWU-China needed patch clamp to test the function of the modified strain they     did not have one, and it was XJTU-China that helped get them one.
label We advised XJTU-China on visas and some considerations for going to the US.
label We intend to help XJTU-China build a plasmid for the hairpin structure and     verify the function.
label We intend to help NWU-China analyze core enzymes they try to transform and     predict mutation points.

2. Collaboration with XJTU-China
2.1 Guiding XJTU-China
XJTU-China is participating in iGEM for the first time this year. As the first team to participate in iGEM in     Shaanxi Province, we were invited to Xi'an Jiaotong University to accord them with guidance and experience sharing.
As follows what we have shared during the exchange are listed:
label Our understanding and analysis of iGEM.
label 2016 and 2017 projects of our team and the competition planning for 2018.
label Entry experience and precautions.
label Team operation mode.
The participation of iGEM for two years has rendered it clear for us to understand what iGEM is about and what iGEM     entails us to do. By sharing our comprehension of iGEM, we believe that XJTU-China will be able to suit the     competition much faster. We gave them a reference for this year's competition by sharing our previous two-year     entries and this year's plan. We summed up the lessons learned from the past two years’ preparations and some easy     mistakes for them, hoping that they will take fewer detours. Funding has always been a headache for most teams     participating in iGEM. We shared with them how our team works to save as much money as possible and get more     funding.
In the later discussion, we:
label Answered their questions about participation and registration.
label Talked over the idea of their project in the preliminary stage and put forward     our suggestions.
label Gave advice on scheduling and personnel management.
XJTU-China also made some suggestions for our project and planning this year.
Afterwards, our two teams also invited NWU-China to co-establish a WeChat group hence more close exchanges and     cooperation in the future.

2.3 XJTU-China’s assistance for us in building five standardized plasmids
We later encountered several problems during the construction of the standardized plasmid. E. coli turned into red     after transforming pSB1C3 plasmid. Plus, atp6 (BBa_K2707006), atp8 (BBa_K2707005), atp9 (BBa_K2707000), cob     (BBa_K2707004) and var1 (BBa_K2707008) , these five fragments could not be constructed on the pSB1C3 plasmid after     many attempts. XJTU-China helped us construct these five plasmids as soon as they knew about our obstacle.

3．Collaboration with NWU-China
3.1 Support for NWU-China in analyzing KcsA protein
We used our laboratory's self-developed Automation Enzyme Mutation Design (AEMD) platform to help NWU-China analyze     the KcsA protein, the core enzyme in their project, and work out the plan for the enzyme modification from both     functional and stability aspects for NWU-China to carry out the next step of enzyme transformation.

4. Collaboration with Jilin-China
4.1 Aid for Jilin_China in verifying the accuracy of the five thermosensors’ measurements
We got to know Jilin-China at the iGEM summit initiated by NKU-China. This year both of our projects pertain to     gene synthesis, so we have been in close contact since. Jilin_China constructed some heat-inducible RNA-based     thermosensors onto the pSB1C3 vector, and installed the Anderson promoter J23104 upstream, superfolder GFP (sfGFP)     downstream. The melting temperature of the thermosensors can be determined by measuring the expression level of     sfGPF at different temperatures. They have measured the fluorescence expression intensity of five heat-inducible     RNA-based therosensors (RT1-4, RT1-33, K2541003, K2541004, K2541010). However, the measurement results may vary     under different laboratory and experimental conditions. To ensure the accuracy of their results, we assisted them     in measuring the changes in fluorescence expression intensity of these 5 thermosensors.
Experiment results:
Figure 4. Fluorescence expression intensity of RT1-4,RT1-33,K2541003, K2541004, K2541010
As is illustrated in the above diagram, K2541003, K2541004 and K2541010 are the three groups of fluorescence     expression intensity that increase as the temperature accrues, indicating that these three thermosensors are in the     'on' state at higher temperatures and proving they are indeed Heat-inducible RNA-based thermosensors. The     fluorescence expression density of RT 1-4 and RT 1-33 does not increase with temperature, manifesting that this     sequence is thermosensor, consistent with the previous measurements of Jilin_China.     Protocol:
1. 100 μL of glycerol bacteria (plasmid containing different thermosensors) was cultured for 4-5 hours and Abs was     measured after dilution, guaranteeing the initial Abs was 0.02 and the volume was made up to 8 mL;
2. 100 μL was added to a black 96-well plate, conducting 3 parallel experiments at different temperatures,     measuring Abs and fluorescence used as the data for 0 h;
3. Incubated at 31 ° C, 35 ° C, 39 ° C respectively;
4. Measured Abs and fluorescence after incubation of 4h, 6h, 8h.

4.2 Jilin_China’s assistance for us in characterizing 2 parts (BBa_K2707004，BBa_K2707008)
In the later stage, due to the heavy burden of our experimental and academic tasks, there were not adequate staff     to characterize all the parts. At the CCIC, Jilin_China came to our aid and proposed to characterize the parts     after learning about our predicament. There existed low GC content in the mitochondrial genomes and a large amount     of replication in E. coli, which jeopardized the balance of four nucleotides in the cell, resulting in strong     cytotoxicity. Jilin_China helped us measure the growth curves of the two submitted parts: cob (BBa_K2707004) and     var1 (BBa_K2707008), the sequences of which were examined to determine if they were toxic to cells.
These two parts are two of the eight proteins expressed by the mitochondrial genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.     One is Cob encoding cytochrome oxidase b, which is a component of the electron transport chain, and another is Var1     that encodes ribosomal protein. Note that cob has been removed all introns.
Experimental results:
Figure 5. The growth curves of cob and var1
Conclusion: These two genes were constructed on pB1C3, the amplification of which after being transferred into DH5α     has little effect on bacterial growth, qualitatively proving that these two sequences are not toxic to cells.
Protocol:
（Link： Jilin-China ）
1. 5 μL of glycerol bacteria were transferred to 5 ml of liquid LB, adding appropriate amount of chloramphenicol     and culturing overnight;
2. Measured the OD value of the three samples and add a certain amount of each sample to 50ml LB (250ml triangle     bottle), with the final OD value being 0.05;
3. Measured the OD value of 0 h with a spectrophotometer;
4. OD value was measured respectively at 0.9, 2.15, 3.1, 4.2, 5.2, 6.1, 7.2, 8.3, 9.1, 12 h. When the OD value     exceeded 0.8, diluted before measuring.
6. Recorded the data, analyzed the charts and drew the conclusions.
5. Collaboration with XMU-China
5.1 Submitting Newsletter to XMU-China
We offered XMU-China a description including our team introduction and project description, which are recorded on     Newsletter 2018 edited by XMU-China. Through this platform, more people are enabled to learn about our project and     we have obtained more opportunities to communicate and cooperate with the external world.
