Rounding to a scale of 10-2 lx it correlates to creating an amperage of 10-4 mA using the silicon photodiode data sheet. This current is passed through a 10kΩ resistor to create a voltage of 5 mV, which is passed through a TI INA118 differential amplifier with a gain of 1000 to produce the maximum readable voltage of 5V using the gain equation found on their data sheet with a gain resistor of 50Ω, this creates the maximum distinction with the blank value. Since the Arduino Uno returns 1023 values the maximum expected value for fluorescence is predicted to be around 1023. The values used in these calculations are interchangeable for other proteins and as such, our modeling can be used to make our hardware applicable for other teams.
Note: The photons emitted by the LED are the limiting quantity in this situation, using 1 mL of an OD of 1 yeast culture, there are fewer photons emitted by the LED than can be emitted by the proteins.
Calculations for comparison are shown below:
