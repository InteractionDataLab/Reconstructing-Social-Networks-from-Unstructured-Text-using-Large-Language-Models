Meeting with Local Farmers
ICT Mumbai interviewed two wheat farmers in India concerning wheat rust, and sent us their responses. Both farmers commonly saw wheat rust in their fields, but were unaware of the Ug99 race group. Wheat rust infections had greatly impacted each of their yields; one reported a 50% yield loss, and the other reported a 25-40% yield loss, and both detected the rust visually. Both farmers controlled fungal infections with fungicide spray and were unaware of what resistance genes their crops had and showed interest in our device. They believed it would be useful by shortening the time required for wheat rust detection.
