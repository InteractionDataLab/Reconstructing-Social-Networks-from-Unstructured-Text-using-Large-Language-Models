Part Function
Ribitol Transporter
BBa_K2663000
Allows for the transport of ribitol into E. coli
These basic part sequences that encode for the following proteins were all derived from foreign organisms and were codon optimized for use in sp. Saccharomyces.

Part Function
Sr35 Resistance Protein (CC-NBS-LRR resistance protein)
BBa_K2663002
Produces the Sr35 resistance protein which triggers a hypersensitive response in wheat when interact to the corresponding Pgt effector
AvrSr35 Avirulence Factor
BBa_K2663003
Produces the AvrSr35 avirulence factor which is naturally secreted by Pgt when infecting wheat
This part was improved from part BBa_K416004 designed by the 2010 NYU iGEM team.
