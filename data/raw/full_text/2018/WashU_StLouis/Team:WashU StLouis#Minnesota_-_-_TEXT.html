Advice from Dr. Olivera Firpo
We corresponded over email with Dr. Olivera Firpo, who researches wheat stem rust at the USDA Cereal Disease Laboratory in St. Paul, Minnesota, one of the leading wheat rust research laboratories in the world. He kindly answered questions that we sent him regarding safety concerns of working with spores, differentiating races of stem rust, methods of achieving durable rust resistance in wheat plants, as well as the current global concerns regarding wheat rust fungi. The full list of questions and responses is attached here .
