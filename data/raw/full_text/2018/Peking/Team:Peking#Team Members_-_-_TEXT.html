Our Team
Over the past six months, we have formed a professional and passionate team, Peking iGEM 2018, with shared goal to strive for, mutual trust, and effective communication. Students from different fields join forces to make the team almighty and competitive.
Meet our talented team
On this page, you can find the information about everybody contributed to the project. We would like to express our special gratitude to our instructors for their continuous support and encouragement. Furthermore, we would like to acknowledge our advisors and all the others who provided valuable advices and essential materials to us. The following is our amazing team.
Chen Yuyang
Basic Medical Sciences
Chen Yuyang is an undergraduate student majoring in basic medical science. He loves doing experiments and solving problems. He enjoys absorbing knowledge from his peers. He is a crazy Arsenal fan and often stays up to watch football games.
Chen Ruhang
yuanpei college
I’m Ruhang Chan from peking university yuanpei college. Mainly taking part in wet lab task and finance work, I’d like to be passionate in everyday life while keep humble doing everyday work. If you are the same, lets talk and have some drink!
Guo Fuyu
Public Health
Guo Fuyu is a junior student majoring in Public Health, with a minor in Economy. Interested in biostatistics, he wants to apply the statistical methods to the biological study and to improve the way to show the data. If asked to choose a program language, he would choose R without any hesitation. R is really amazing !
Li Kai
Life Sciences
Li Kai is a sophomore in life science. He became the team leader because he broadly browse in many fields but proficient in none of them. Similarly, he paticipated in almost everything but always got an interesting result. Thanks to the team members with different skills, everything went well.
Lin Yongjie
Integrated Science Program
Lin Yongjie is an undergraduate majoring in Integrated Science from Yuanpei College, Peking University. She enjoys the journey as an interdisciplinary research and mainly takes the responsibility of quantitative characterization and modeling. The Chinese traditional literature and customs enriches her life and gives her encouragement. She also enjoys volleyball in the free time.
Li Tairan
Integrated Science Program
Li Tairan is a sophomore from Yuanpei College, Peking University, majoring in Integrated Science. He mainly worked on coding, HP and art design, but he wouldn’t hesitate carrying out molecular cloning as well when needed. As one of the youngest members of the team, Li Tairan brought vitality to everyone around him, always motivating his teammates. Obsessive with fixing typos, he enjoyed spending time polishing our wiki, posters and presentations. Crazy pool player as he is, you can often find him in a billiard hall outside the lab!
Li Xin
Life Sciences
Li Xin is an undergraduate from the School of Life Sciences, Peking University. He is interested in life science and his involvement in the Peking iGEM team was his second project. He loves scientific research and will keep it up.
Ouyang Xiaoyi
Physics
Ouyang Xiaoyi is a sophomore from the School of Physics, Peking University. His interest lies in understanding life mechanism underlied by basic physics principles. In this project, he mainly participated in the modelling part and was fortunate to initiate his first biological experiments concerning molecular cloning. This three-dimensional negentropic living object loves to sleep and tries to keep everything witty and cool all the time.
Shen Xuanyu
Internship
Shen Xuanyu is a junior in high school, who has strong interest in synthetic biology. He defines himself as a quiet person with a lot of energy inside. Outside lab, he plays American football and basketball.
Shi Shuyu
Clinical Medicine
"It's impossible!""You can't make it!" Shi shuyu has heard many times! Although she majors in clinical medicine, she hopes to be a talented person in scientific research. She is very interested in synthetic biology. And in order to make herself more comprehensive, to follow her beloved, and to go further on the road of scientific research, she minors in physics, regardless of the obstruction of others. The experiment is the same as life. You’ll be happy if the experiment is consistent with expectations. And it will be interesting if the experiment is not consistent with expectations. But I prefer to have the sense of accomplishment after a series of interesting experiences.
Song Deying
Integrated Science Program
Song Deying is a sophomore from the Integrated Science Program of Peking University. She worked mainly on modeling the dynamics and kinetics of phase separation  system and was in charge of human practice as well. She also helped with plasmid extraction and carotene extraction in the lab. She enjoys reading and traveling in her spare time.
Yang Jianzhao
Life Sciences
Yang Jianzhao is a senior student from School of Life Sciences, Peking University. He manages the lab operating affairs and participates in molecular cloning. Being curious to new techniques and experimental skills, he has been following the iGEM community with an open mind since high school days. He believes that synthetic biology will lead next science revolution in the future. Now Yang is going to be a candidate of Ph.D major in biotechnology, which mainly focus on the plant development physiology and photosynthesis, molecular farming and biopharmaceuticals. He is wild about science fiction, soccer, Otaku culture (A fan of Aqours), and railway transport.
Zhang Wei
Basic Medical Sciences
Zhang Wei is a junior student majoring in basic medicine. She is engaged in molecular cloning and transfecting the yeast. Synthetic biology provides her with a new vision of understanding biological system and that is why she joins the Peking iGEM team. When not in the lab, she loves photography and rock and roll. Besides, culturing neurons is also one of her hobbies.
Zhong Bitao
Basic Medical Sciences
Zhong Bitao is an undergraduate from School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University, who has a keen interest in biology. He enjoyed his time in iGEM very much, for this is where he can study synthetic biology and carry out experiments with his colleagues and fellows. He is currently striving to become a medical scientist with his passion in scientific research.
Zhu Yuhao
Pharmacy
Zhu Yuhao is a junior student majoring in pharmacy, at Health science center of Peking University. It is the first time for him to do a research in a team-work way with so many different schools’ students at Peking University. In 2018 Peking iGEM project he take responsible for plasmid construction and produced many plasmids during August which was tested by other team members in yeasts. He learnt lots of new things including new methods and ideas and he will use these things as bases to move further in synthesis biology in the future. By the way, while waiting for PCR and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis, he watched ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 to kill time.
