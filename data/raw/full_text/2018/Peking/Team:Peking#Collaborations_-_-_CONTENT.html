</DIV><DIV class="coll"><DIV class="content"><P>In our simulation of metabolism with and without phase separation, we inevitably need the kinetic parameters of enzymes used in our pathway to produce β-carotene. Only if we have relatively accurate enzyme kinetic data, can we make tenable predictions based on our models. On hearing <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tongji-Software/Collaborations">Tongji-Software</A>’s software on finding the most efficient pathway of production together with the pertinent kinetic parameters, we proposed to collaborate with them. Their software sufficed our need and we provided them with another plausible application.

</DIV><DIV class="coll"><DIV class="content"><P>On July 6th, we gladly accepted the invitation from <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:NKU_CHINA/Collaborations">NKU_CHINA</A> and took part in the summit meeting of International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition hosted by NKU_CHINA in Tianjin with eight other universities. 

While it was just the beginning of summer vacation and most teams did not have many experimental results yet, we exchanged our ideas about the total design, modelling and human practice. A short afternoon as it may be, we nevertheless obtained valuable ideas on polishing the slides, taking more variables into consideration and optimizing the experimental design.
</P><P>
We were a little nervous when we made the presentation, partly because it was the first time for us to do it. However, we learned that practice makes perfect and the better acquainted we became with our system, the more confident we will be. Since then, we worked ever harder and gradually had our own taste of doing scientific research.

</DIV><DIV class="coll"><DIV class="content"><P>On July 14th, we communicated with two iGEM teams from <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:DLUT_China/Collaborations">DLUT_China</A> at Peking University. It is our great honor to invite them to come here.</P><P style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
The three teams introduced their projects in turn. We chose the three different tracks foundational advances, hardware and therapeutics, and shared advice from different points of view which benefited us in a major way. We’d like to thank professors Wei Ping and Zi Lihan for their specific instructions and kind help.
</P><P>We then exchanged our experience in modelling, experiments and human practice and helped each other with troubleshooting. Our friends from DLUT_China then visited our lab and we talked about how to make use of the available space more efficiently.


It was a rather pleasant communication and we looked forward to further collaboration with them. Later on, we provided <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:DLUT_China/Collaborations">DLUT_China</A> with plasmid pSB and it is our pleasure to collaborate with them.

</DIV><DIV class="coll"><DIV class="content"><P>To communicate with the teams from universities in Beijing and seek deeper cooperation, we invited colleagues from <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:BIT-China/Collaborations">BIT-China</A>, <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:BNU-China/Collaborations">BNU-China</A>, <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:OUC-China">OUC-China</A>, <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tsinghua/Collaborations">Tsinghua</A>, and <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:UCAS-China/Collaborations">UCAS-China</A> to Peking University and hosted the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition Symposium in Beijing on August 7th 2018.

Each of the six teams presented their projects and answered questions from the audience, which to a large extent gave them ideas on refining the project both scientifically and from the engineering standpoint.
</P><P>
After the presentations, we had a luncheon and all the students communicated with each other freely. We came up with a number of scientific questions worth exploring. We both accepted and offered several pieces of useful advice on modelling, which helped us and our friends to better explain and predict the systems. We also talked about some particular experimental techniques, which boosted the efficiency of lab work later on.

</DIV><DIV class="coll"><DIV class="content"><P>We took part in the Conference of the Chinese iGEM Community from August 27th to August 31st 2018 in <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:ShanghaiTech/Collaborations">ShanghaiTech</A>. It was a great opportunity for us to learn from hundreds of iGEMers from across China and professors from different fields.
</P><P>
We made the presentation on the morning of August 28th. We made great progress in various aspects including speech fluency and artistic design of the slides. We were asked several questions about the functions of the phase separation system, which shed light on our experiments and reminded us of some potential new applications.
</P><P>
A total of 63 wonderful presentations and excellent posters in the following days took us on a brilliant tour of synthetic biology. We communicated, we doubted, we thought and we learned. It is our great pleasure to be a part of this year’s CCiC.
</P><P>
Tired, surprised, but delighted, we were given the awards fo the best presentation and the best poster, which encouraged us to try our best in the last one and a half months.
