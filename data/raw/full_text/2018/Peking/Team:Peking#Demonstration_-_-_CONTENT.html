Figure. 1A Structure of SUMO3 and SIM. SIMs bind to a surface patch between the α-helix and a β-sheet of the SUMO protein and extend the β-sheet of SUMO by one additional strand. The SIM either attaches as a parallel or an antiparallel strand to the SUMO β-sheet. Binding is primarily mediated by a stretch of four residues containing 3–4 hydrophobic amino acids (I, V, or L). This core interaction motif is a common property of SIMs.

We then observed the cells that had been treated with rapamycin for 12 hours under the microscope and confirmed that the yeast cells are in good condition and the synthetic organelles didn’t disappear.

Thinking differently, rapamycin can be detected by the synthetic organelles. If the substance to be detected can bind with two proteins (homologous or heterologous) simultaneously, these proteins can be used as the interaction module to construct a synthetic organelle, and the presence of the detected molecule can consequently be shown by the formation of the synthetic organelles. As shown before, synthetic organelles arise when rapamycin is added, which means that the presence of synthetic organelles corresponds to the presence of rapamycin.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="coll"><DIV class="content"><P>Thus, we first verified this function with rapamycin. We cultured the yeast cells with different concentrations of rapamycin to make sure that rapamycin has enough time to diffuse into the calls and the formation of SPOT can reach the equilibrium state. We then observed the yeast cells under a microscope and made statistics on the proportion of the yeast with SPOT formation. The formation of the SPOT reflected the concentration of rapamycin well.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="coll"><DIV class="content"><P>Since rapamycin can be detected by SPOT, we went further and considered whether SPOT can also detect other molecules. Here we verified this potential by detecting ABA. Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important phytohormone that regulates plant stress responses. Proteins from the PYR-PYL-PCAR family were identified as ABA receptors. Upon binding to ABA, a PYL protein associates with type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) such as ABI1 and ABI2, inhibiting their activity.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="coll"><DIV class="content"><P>In our design, if we use PYL1/ABI1 as interaction modules, we will see the SPOT forming in the cell after ABA administration. However, we found the green fluorescence, which shows the location of PYL1, condensed into a granule like the SPOT before ABA administration. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="coll"><DIV class="content"><P>We then manage to work out the reason. Previous structural and biochemical observations have provided insights into PYL-mediated ABA signaling, which can be explained by an efficacious model. In the absence of ABA signaling, PP2Cs are fully active and PYLs exist as inactive homodimers in cells, unable to bind or inhibit PP2Cs, mainly due to the incompatible conformation of the CL2loop. In response to ABA binding, the CL2 loop undergoes a conformational rearrangement to close over the ABA-binding pocket, which enables the interaction between PYLs and PP2Cs. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="coll"><DIV class="content"><P>This information explained this strange phenomenon, and also enabled a prediction. In the absence of ABA, SPOT formed only with PYL1 for the homodimers of PYL1. Thus, we can observe the green fluorescence in SPOT, but no red fluorescence colocalization. After we added ABA to the yeast, ABI1 entered the organelles through the interaction of ABI1 and PYL1, and we saw red aggregates colocalize with green aggregates in cells under the fluorescence microscope. We then verified this ABA sensor through the formation of red fluorescence. The pattern met the prediction perfectly and the system also detected ABA with a high sensitivity. .</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="coll"><DIV class="content"><P>This experiment also inspired us to design a new regulation method: controlling the location of one of the component instead of controlling the formation of SPOT. As the experiment demonstrated, new components can enter the original organelles and the time of occurrence can be regulated as it is inducer-mediated. This gave our designs and functions more possibilities.

The delay can be further shortened if the detected molecules are inside the cells.

Due to liquid-liquid phase separation inside cells, the synthetic organelles and the cytosol will form a boundary. This boundary has some special properties, such as absorbance effects. The synthetic organelles also condense many substances, which results in a different reaction environment and different concentration between the synthetic organelles and the cytosol. All these effects can affect the reaction rate and the direction of reaction in the synthetic organelles.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="coll"><DIV class="content"><P>Since the effects of the synthetic organelles on different reactions can be diverse due to all the factors referred to above, we develop a model to find out the key factors that effect this process. The model suggests that a higher solubility of the substrate or intermediate in the droplet phase and a relatively large KM lead to higher reaction rate. ( Please read the model for more details)</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="coll"><DIV class="content"><P>According to the conclusion given by the model, we examined the production of β-carotene as a first step. The intermediates of this pathway  are hydrophobic and the reaction have a large KM, we suppose SPOT might increase the produce of β-carotene. What’s more, the β-carotene production pathway is widely used in biology. It is robust and its activity is directly observable since β-carotene is orange. We fused the three enzymes that produce β-carotene into the synthetic organelles. In the presence of rapamycin, they can condense into aggregates.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="coll"><DIV class="content"><P>As the result shows, after adding rapamycin, the yeast accumulate more β-carotene and the color become redder.</P><DIV align="center"><P>To demonstrate this increasing quantitatively, we extract β-carotene from the yeast and measure the concentration with HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography). HPLC result also show an increasing after adding rapamycin.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="coll"><DIV class="content"><P>Here we already demonstrate that SPOT can regulate the reaction rate and further regulate the produce of the pathway. However, there are still too many phenomes that we can not explain in a near future. Through more work on different metabolic pathway, we may one day can using SPOT to control the metabolism in cell.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="coll"><DIV class="content"><FIGCAPTION style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
