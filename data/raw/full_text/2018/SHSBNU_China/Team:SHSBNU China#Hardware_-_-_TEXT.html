Our team designed a water filter for sewage treatment named Filter. The filter bead filled with bi-odegradable materials polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) as a solid platform as well as carbon source for our Biofilm x Laccase, so it can decompose azo dyes while letting the liquid flow through the filter.
We find out that the Filter benefits the practical applications for several aspects. First, the con-sumable filter bead is degradable and environmental friendly. Second, Biofilm x Laccase system accelerates the disposal by catalyzing azo dyes degradation in the concentrated filter bead, in turn, saving time and increasing the efficiency. Third, living bacteria in Biofilm x Laccase system sustain longer than other filtration materials such as activated carbon which is easily to wear off by time and needed to change frequently.
