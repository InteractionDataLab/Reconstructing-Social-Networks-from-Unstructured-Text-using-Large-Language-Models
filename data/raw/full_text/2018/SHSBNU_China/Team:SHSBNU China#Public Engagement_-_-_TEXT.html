Overview
Our public education includes two sections: inner and outer school propaganda. As for on campus part, we design and take a strict but excellent education system by using the resource inside school, and are willing to pass on our system to next generations of IGEMer as a tradition.
As for out of campus part, we establish the collaboration with sewage plant for exchanging the instructive information through biology, plant and policy. It is the only the first step for our team, we strongly believe that the usefulness of our project would attract more plant even business company to cooperate with us.
a. On campus part
We conducted lectures about our IGEM project and synthetic biology techniques to students on Tuesday and Thursday weekly. At the start of our education program, during the club exhibition, we briefly introduced our project's purpose, effectiveness and future potential contribution to environment to identify and attract the students who is interested in protecting environment. After that, for the students who as well as have further interests in learning the method of designing something to protect our habitat, we held a series of lectures to explain the specific mechanism, and prove practicability of our project. Furthermore, we taught them about the knowledge of techniques and thinking method we used in designing and finishing the project. In general, our inner-school education program comprehensively passed on our experience as IGEMer and the synthetic biology knowledge as well as triggered their passion of learning synthetic biology and being an IGEMer to think about pollution problems and solutions to retard it.
For the whole process of education, we put a high value on the effectiveness of lecture. Therefore, we required students who is willing to cooperate our work to register their WeChat account, and privately asked randomly 75% of students each time to talk about their experience of it to adjust and improve the content of our lecture for satisfying most of audiences.
b. Out of campus part
Because of the belief in the usefulness of our project and the resolution of protecting habitat, after we visited work leaders of a sewage treatment plant, they established a long-term collaboration to help us conduct the design of our program by providing first-hand information of sewage plant. They intend to know more information of this type of modified biology treatment, and are willing to offer some latest policy to us for having more widely perspective of this project.
