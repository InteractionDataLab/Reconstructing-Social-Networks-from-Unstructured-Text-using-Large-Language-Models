The textile industry creates environmental problems due to the release of highly polluting effluents containing substances from different stages of dyeing that are resistant to light, water, and various chemicals. These dyes would do harm to human health and ecological system. The biological degradation of dyes is an economical and environmentally friendly alternative. Thus, the aim of team SHSBNU_China is to create a biofilm for discoloration of synthetic reactive dyes. The team would use biofilm of E. coli and engineered it to contain the laccase CotA from B. subtilis, which is a polyphenol oxidase that can catalyze the degradation of dyes. In the form of living biofilm, the bio-degradation will be more resistant to stress from environment or different effluents.
