The Schematic diagram of the Filter
In order to make the decomposition process more effective, our team comes up with the idea about making a Filter via Bluepha capsule. The Filter will be divided into six parts:
An upper water tube which inflow the sewage into Blupha capsules
The first strainer that filtrate impurities which might physically destroy the Blupha capsule like solid particles, stringer, and soft colloid
Blupha capsules is PHA beads covered with E. coli that express laccase and form biofilm. In order to make a more stable structure, the Bluepha capsule will be arranged densely. As the sewage flow through the plant, Bluepha capsule would decompose the sewage efficiently
An outer tube that allows sewage to flow through the two strainers and Blupha capsules
A tube that would expel the degraded sewage out of the water-filter
A strainer that will hold the bacteria and prevent the bacteria from flowing out of the device
As sewage inflow the Filter through the upper water tube, the impurities in the sewage will be fil-trated by the strainer. Then the sewage without impurities would flow into the part with Bluepha capsule, so the dyes in sewage will be decomposed effectively.  After the decomposition, the sew-age without dyes will flow out of the Filter through the Filter. The flow velocity will be controlled by a flow control valve.
