The challenge thereby remains in successfully applying the research to its intended target group, a task that requires awareness and planning.  In order to better integrate our research to address HIV-1 detection in infants located in rural areas, we contacted various officials for experience and advice. Among these professionals include those with experience in conducting HIV research in the field, professionals who work with safety, and NGO officials associated with this disease. As a result of these correspondences, we were able to formulate appropriate plans and modified our project accordingly as mentioned below.'),   h('p', null, 'Brief summaries of all communications will be included below, however, the key areas that were discussed have been detailed here. Amongst the various issues that were brought up, three main issues were commonly discussed: communication, cost, and sterility. Our team’s plan regarding all problems and associated modification of our project have been described as follows.'),   h('p', null, 'In a rural setting, it is given that hospitals and labs have limited resources. As such, the abilities and restrictions of the patient must be properly considered, in order to alleviate stress on the hospital. For instance, many mothers travel to centrally located hospitals to receive care but return home within 24 hours to resume their normal life. Thereby, their time in the hospital is limited. Even though many people in these rural villages have phones, hospitals lack the manpower to communicate results and follow up with patients once they leave its vicinity. As a result, many people are not aware of their health conditions, even after being tested. As such, our proposed diagnostic kit has a quick turnaround rate in order to best suit the availability of the mothers. The protocols run in our detection kit allow the testing to be conducted within a 6 hour turnaround period. After results have been procured, they will be securely shared with the infant’s mother (in order to protect the patient’s privacy), and information regarding further treatment can be provided at this point.'),   h('p', null, 'Additionally, when conducting any project, cost estimates are important as well. Many rapid detection tests for HIV are fairly reasonable, most of them being under $100. In an effort to keep costs low, our proposed test utilizes protocols that can be done in very resource limiting environments. For instance, many HIV detection tests utilize PCR which requires a thermocycler or similar environment that can replicate varying temperatures. With our planned protocol, a thermocycler is unnecessary and in its stead, a fixed temperature water bath can be used. Similarly, all reagents and enzymes are aliquoted to prevent contamination or spoiling or large quantities of materials. In addition, if this was a real venture, proper funding would be established whether it be from the government or another organization to support the implementation of this test.'),   h('p', null, 'As with any detection protocol, sterility is crucial. A controlled workspace in central to any accurate testing, however, this environment is not feasible in many low resource facilities. In rural labs, not only does equipment tend to be lacking, but the training of the nurses and lab technicians is not on par with those in other countries. Since these individuals are the ones using the kit, it is important to provide adequate training and information to ensure proper use. In an attempt to address this issue, we have proposed to include safety and sterility protocols along with our kit. By providing additional information and a reference for standard aseptic technique, we hope to alleviate some of the discrepancies that may arise from different educational backgrounds. As previously mentioned, the design of our project encourages sterility. All reagents are lyophilized to increase resistance in harsh environments. Likewise, all enzymes and reagents are aliquoted to prevent cross-contamination. Moreover, in order to collect reliable results, all testing with the diagnostic kit will use both positive and negative controls throughout the entirety of the protocol to ensure contamination has been prevented at every stage.'),   h('p', null, 'As a result of our interviews, we began drafting a sample training protocol recommended by Dr. Leautaud.

So how many white blood cells will be present? Assume that there will be 10 HIV copies in that 50 microliters of the blood sample, then you must look at LAMP; you have 20 microliter LAMP reaction and 50 microliters, so you can identify how much the HIV copies are present. From there you can identify how many copies you will need for the CRISPR assay to work and how many for the fluoresce to work (find the limit of detection of the LAMP assay).”')             )           ),           h('li', null, 'Dr. Leautaud recommends doing the experiment with the fluorophore specifically because even if it says that it is visible to the naked eye, it is important to identify the concentration that must be present for it to be visible?'),           h('li', null, 'She recommends to focus on the CRISPR assay with a really clear limit of detection and characterize the assay (do a dilution series of the assay).'),           h('li', null, 'Dr. Leautaud adds that we can consider a paper test instead of a test tube if that is better suited to our goal.'),         )       )     )   ),    h(g.Section, {title: 'Lindsey Dawson'},     'Associate Director, HIV Policy',     h('br'),     'Kaiser Family Foundation',     h('p', null, 'Ms. t will accompany our kit')         )       ),       h('li', null, 'She details on how understanding the importance of detection is important, but how it is equally important to consider the steps that should be taken to get treatment afterward (eg. antiretroviral treatment)'),       h('li', null, 'Sent the following information (even though the CDC material is focused on US primarily)',         h('ul', null,           h('li', null, h('a', {href: 'https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/23447'}, 'CDC recommendations on Lab testing for HIV')),           h('li', null, h('a', {href: 'https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/testing/hiv-tests-laboratory-use.pdf'}, 'Lab tests')),           h('li', null, h('a', {href: 'https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/testing/rapid-hiv-tests-non-clinical.pdf'}, 'Rapid tests')),           h('li', null, h('a', {href: 'https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/testing/hiv-tests-advantages-disadvantages_1.pdf   '}, 'Advantages/Disadvantages to different HIV tests')),           h('li', null, h('a', {href: 'https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/50872'}, 'Recommended testing algorithm')),           h('li', null, h('a', {href: 'https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/testing/laboratorytests.html'}, 'More info here (incl. all the above links)')),           h('li', null, h('a', {href: 'http://www.oraquick.com/What-is-OraQuick/OraQuick-In-Home-HIV-Test'}, 'OraSure’s home test')),           h('li', null, h('a', {href: 'http://aidsinfo.unaids.org/'}, 'To see hardest hit countries, including where share of people unaware of their HIV status is highest (i.e. undiagnosed)'))         )       )     )   ),   h(g.Section, {title: 'Christopher R Singh'},     'Biological Safety Officer, MS, Ph.D.',     h('br'),     'The University of Texas at Austin',     h('br'),     'Environmental Health and Safety',     h('p', null, 'Dr. Singh served as our guide for various safety concerns and was able to provide us information on various regulations as follows.'),     h('ul', null,       h('li', null, 'Based on the procedures and information provided, are there specific clearances or hazards that we need to be aware of?'),       h('li', null, 'What is the best way to handle blood spots or DNA samples when using a detection kit?

Research would need to be done in a BSL-2 space hopefully equipped with a biosafety cabinet.  The hazards with the research would of course be the human material as well as the virus or viral components. In the field there would be little opportunity for working aseptically unless the plan would be for a mobile lab to be in place. The best you can do there would be best practice or universal precautions, the idea being that you would treat all samples as potentially pathogenic or infectious, but there would likely not be an opportunity to set up a BSC or any type of clean work space.  You would want proper PPE which at a minimum would be clothes that cover skin (long sleeve etc.) gloves, eye protection and a lab coat.  Depending on how samples will be obtained there may be additional requirements needed.  All the waste should be hazardous material/biowaste, this means for the research side it will need to be autoclaved or disposed of in biohazard boxes.  For field work you would need to check country regulations since they often differ, but you would still want to consider it hazardous waste.
