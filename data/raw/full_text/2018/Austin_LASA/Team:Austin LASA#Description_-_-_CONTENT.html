It is estimated that there are approximately 1500 new cases of HIV infection in children under the age of 15, 90% of which occur in the developing world and contracted HIV at birth [', r(1), ']. Infants often show symptoms of HIV very early on, and in some cases, HIV can rapidly evolve into AIDS [', r(2), ']. As such, it is imperative that infants with HIV are diagnosed as early as possible.'),

    h('p', null, 'Unfortunately, HIV diagnosis in infants faces more challenges than HIV diagnosis in adults. Typical serological assays result in large false positives and negatives as infants retain maternal HIV antibodies for up to 18 months, initially obtaining them through transplacental fluid in utero or through breastfeeding milk postnatally, and are therefore unreliable for use as a diagnostic method [', r(2), ']. As a result, HIV DNA/RNA PCR tests, p24 core antigen tests, and HIV cultures are the only reliable diagnostic tests for HIV in infants [', r(2), ', ', r(4), ']. PCR tests, although reliable, are frequently unavailable in resource-constrained settings where the proper lab equipment and skilled personnel are limited [', r(5), ']. HIV cultures, similarly to PCR tests, require proper lab equipment and skilled personnel in addition to taking up to two weeks to grow and obtain results [', r(3), ']. p24 core antigen tests also require proper lab equipment and skilled personnel, but are undergoing testing and clinical evaluation for their utility [', r(5), '].')

  h(g.Section, {title: 'How Does Our Project Tie In?'},
    h('p', null, 'As mentioned previously, often in order to perform PCR, a clinic or other diagnostic center must send their sample to another location with more sophisticated equipment. Often by the time the results are ready to get back to the patient, the disease has progressed too far or the patient is impossible to contact. This is why our project incorporates an alternative amplification method, Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP), which can be done at the point of care. Performing LAMP does not require a thermal cycler, so it can be done in a water bath that is kept at a constant temperature of 60–65 °C. LAMP requires 4 primers that result in an end product of a multitude of copies attached by loops [', r(8), ']. In our project, we tested primers for LAMP since sometimes primer sets that should theoretically work, do not do so. Furthermore, we examined the specificity and efficiency of the reaction. The amplicons from the LAMP reaction would subsequently be detected using Cas12a, which is discussed in the next paragraph.'),

This property of Cas12a has been utilized for the detection of specific nucleotide sequences [', r(6), ', ', r(7), ']. In these detection assays, Cas12a is assembled with a crRNA including a spacer sequence specific to a duplexed target strand. A fluorophore-quencher pair connected by a short ssDNA sequence is present in the same reaction. Once the Cas12a-crRNA complex is binded to and cleaves a duplexed target strand, Cas12a indiscriminately cleaves any ssDNA or RNA sequence in its vicinity, including the fluorophore-quencher pair. The released fluorophore can then be detected.'),

Much like with PCR and HIV culture tests, many resource-constrained settings also lack the ability to house specific reagents and proper transportation of enzymes to remote areas is difficult [', r(5), ']. For these reasons, we also aimed to look into the use of lyophilized bacterial reagents, termed “cellular reagents.” Bacteria can be modified to express certain enzymes, grown, and then lyophilized with their produced enzyme. These “cellular reagents” can then be transported dry, stored at room temperature for extended periods of time, and resuspended later at the time of use. Introducing cellular reagents into our HIV-1 diagnostic kit would make it much more accessible to resource-limited settings.'),

Dr. Leautaud further advised us to focus on our isothermal amplification and detection assays, stating that, if it was necessary, we could collaborate with other teams or labs on the matter of nucleotide isolation.'), h('p', null, '(To read more on how human practices impacted the development of our kit, go to our Kit Considerations page ', h('a', {href: 'https://2018.igem.org/Team:Austin_LASA/Kit'}, 'here'), '.)')),

We chose to work with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as our PI and lab mentors have prior experience with LAMP.'), h('p', null, 'LAMP is a reaction that relies on four specific primers. These primers are more difficult to design than the primers for PCR so we used PrimerExplorer to design primers that would amplify various regions of Rev. At the location of point of care, someone would pipette the isolated viral DNA into a tube with rehydrated LAMP cellular regents and then add a mastermix (that was previously stored at a lower temperature).

As stated earlier, our detection assay would take advantage of Cas12a’s characteristic to indiscriminately cleave any single-stranded nucleotides in its vicinity following cleavage of a duplexed target strand. We would use our amplified DNA from our LAMP reactions as our target strands and design corresponding crRNA sequences to specifically detect our viral DNA. As mentioned before, we would use a fluorophore-quencher pair to detect Cas12a activity. In order to translate our detection assay to cellular reagents, we would express Cas12a and crRNA in bacteria, then subsequently lyophilize said bacteria to create cellular reagents.
