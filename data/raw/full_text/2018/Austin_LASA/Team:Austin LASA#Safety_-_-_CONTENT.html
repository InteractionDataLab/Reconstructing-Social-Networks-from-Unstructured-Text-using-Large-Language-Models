Instead, we decided to use a gene from the organism that wasnâ€™t dangerous and cleared by iGEM. After in depth research into the genes found in HIV-1, we settled on using the gene that produced the Rev protein. Rev is a regulatory protein and therefore would pose no danger to us and be usable in our laboratory. The protein is necessary for HIV-1 replication, so we can be sure that it would be present in the organism (HIV) that we wish to detect. It serves as a viable substitute for HIV-1 itself making our experiment a valid proof of concept for the detection of the HIV-1 virus.')

We clean our lab bench both before and after use in order to keep our workspace clean and sterile. Every single experiment was conducted while wearing gloves and lab coats when necessary. Members of the iGEM team wore closed toed shoes, long pants, and clothing without any ties or decorations that could get in the way. Members of the team tied back long hair and secured any jewelry that may hang down or get caught on objects in the lab. When we dealt with chemicals that could be mild irritants, such as MOPS, we wore respirators in order to protect ourselves. We made sure to dispose everything properly, such as putting necessary waste products in the biohazard bins. We did nothing that would require additional safety measures.')
