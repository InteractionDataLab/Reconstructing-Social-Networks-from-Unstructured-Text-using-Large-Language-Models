We chose to work with LAMP (Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification) because of its high selectivity, rapid amplification, and isothermal nature (rendering a thermal cycler unnecessary).'),
    h('p', null, 'After qualitatively narrowing down our pool of potential LAMP primers from four to six (See the graphs on our Design, Development, and Results page), we needed to choose which of the remaining four was the most effective in amplifying our HIV sample. We used kinetic modelling to compare the efficiency of each set of primers with the purified Bst enzyme. A recent article by  Subramanian and Gomez proposed an empirical kinetic model for LAMP based on a generalized logistic curve [', r(1), ']. No ab initio model has been developed for the complex LAMP mechanism, but the logistic curve approximation can still be understood mechanistically in terms of the “competition between the so-called extended cauliflower-like structures and the complementary dumb bell structures in the cycling amplification step” [', r(1), '] during the LAMP reaction.'),

We fit our data to this model using SciPy’s curve_fit function. It is also worth noting that our data and fitted parameters are actually in units of fluorescence, not concentration. We assumed that the two were proportional and worked in terms of fluorescence instead because that was the data we had readily available.'),

We use the slopes of these regressions as a measure of the effectiveness of the primer set, with a higher magnitude corresponding to a greater primer effectiveness. Primer set 14 had a significantly higher slope magnitude than the other sets, so we can conclude that it will be the most effective primer for amplifying our HIV sample with LAMP.')

Such a combined reaction would also be novel to our knowledge, and we’re interested in examining how the placement of the target sequence on the LAMP amplicons would affect the Cas12a kinetics. Although we’ve already collected data on both target sequences, we haven’t collected this data for a Cas12a reaction run on LAMP amplicons, and only the LAMP amplicons have the differing linear and loop segments, so we were unable to look into this with our current data.'),
