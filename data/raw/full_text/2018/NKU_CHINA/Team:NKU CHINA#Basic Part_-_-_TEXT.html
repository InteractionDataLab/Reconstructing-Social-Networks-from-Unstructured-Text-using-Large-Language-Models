BBa_K2705000 : PgltAB
Design
This sequence includes the promoter (forward) of gltAB (glutamate synthase) and the promoter (backward) of gltC (LysR family transcriptional regulator). GltC can bind specific DNA site on it. Thus the expression of downstream proteins is upregulated, which is repressed by high concentration glutamate.
Since PgltAB can sense intracellular glutamate level, we combined it with proteins such as GFP and LacI, so that these proteins can respond to intracellular glutamate concentration and carry out their own function.
Proof of Function
Detection of gltC transcription level in LL3-PgltAB-GFP under different glutamate concentrations
LL3-PgltAB-GFP was cultured in M9 medium with different extracellular glutamate concentrations. From the 6th hour, we extracted the total RNA of LL3-PgltAB-GFP every 3 hours and tested the transcription of gltC together with the respective intracellular glutamate concentrations. Transcription level of gltC in plateau phase is shown in Fig. 1. It could be indicated that the transcription of gltC was repressed with the increasing intracellular glutamate concentration. Primers used in the assay are listed in Table 1.

The strains were cultured at 37 °C in M9 medium with 5 µg/mL chloromycetin under different extracellular glutamate concentration (0 g/L, 2.5 g/L, 5.0 g/L) for 24 hours. Data indicate mean values ± standard deviations from three independent experiments performed in triplicates.
GFP fluorescent intensity (FI) reports the PgltAB function
PgltAB-GFP and P43-GFP were converted into both B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 Δbam and B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 Δbam -icd strain (with stronger promoter before icd gene), which were designated as LL3-PgltAB-GFP and LL3-icd-PgltAB-GFP respectively. The two mutants were cultured in M9 culture medium for 24 hours. If needed the medium was supplemented with antibiotics or glutamate at the following concentrations: 5 µg/mL chloramphenicol, 0 g/L, 0.5 g/L, 1.0 g/L, 2.5 g/L or 5.0 g/L glutamate. During the fermentation, 1.5mL bacteria culture was taken out every 3 hours, of which 600µL was for GFP FI measurement (395nm\509nm) by microplate reader, and 900µL for OD600 measurement.
Fig.2 Principle for detecting the PgltAB function. Under high glutamate concentration, GltC level goes down, reducing the level of GFP.

The strains were cultured at 37 °C in M9 medium with 5 µg/mL chloromycetin for 24 hours under different extracellular glutamate concentration (0 g/L, 0.5 g/L, 1.0 g/L, 2.5 g/L, 5.0 g/L). Intracellular glutamate concentration, fluorescence intensity of GFP and the OD600 were measured. FI of GFP was normalized against OD600. Data indicate mean values ± standard deviations from three independent experiments performed in triplicates.
