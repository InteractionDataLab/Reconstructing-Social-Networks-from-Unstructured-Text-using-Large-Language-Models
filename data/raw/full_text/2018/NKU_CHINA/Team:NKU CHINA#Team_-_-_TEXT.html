I’m Weixia Gao, the instructor of iGEM 2018 Team NKU_CHINA. I’m a Post-doctoral in Laboratory Environmental Microbiology and Microbial Manufacturing, College of Life Science, Nankai University. My research focused on Synthetic Biology. In 2008, I entered NanKai University and 10 years’ college life have given me the knowledge and ambition about microbiology. It is a great pity that I did not take part in iGEM during undergraduate period. Thus I am very happy to share my experiences of scientific research to members of NKU_CHINA team as a instructor this year. I hope our group can do a fantastic job and that every member can truly gain by participating.

I'm Ziyu Wang, a team leader of 2018 iGEM team "NKU_CHINA". This isn't my first time participating iGEM, but the first time to be a team leader. Having trained in Prof. Cunjiang Song's lab for 2 years and taking part in the iGEM last year inspired me a lot, which helped me determined the future research goal—synthetic biology. This year, facing much more difficulties and challenges, we are actually doing a very good job. It’s an honor to have this chance working with my teammates. Looking forward to communicating with iGEMers all over the world! Boston, we are coming! Wish our team an excellent result!

I’m Danqing Tong, a junior student in Nankai University, majoring in Biology(Poling Class). With much interest in synthetic biology, I participated in NKU_CHINA as a member of experimental group, aiming to figure out what the synthetic biology is and whether it is like what I imagine. With progress of our project and communication with other students and professors who do rather well in this field, my mind has been broadened a lot and I have had a deeper understanding of synthetic biology. I appreciate this competition, and I’m excited about the coming Giant Jamboree!

My name is Zhaolin Ma, a student of Nankai University, majoring in Electronic Information Science and Technology. I am now participating in the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition who is in charge of the art design group. My duty is to make our image, typography or Experimental designs creative, attractive and easier to understand. Before I joined the team NKU_CHINA, I had got the first prize of “Nankai Dream plus Innovation and Entrepreneurship Practice Project” and the GongNeng scholarship of Nankai university for twice. It’s fortunate for me that I can seize this opportunity to make some of my idea and design shown on the international stage. I also enjoy the days that our team work together. I hope we can achieve a good result in the end.

Here comes Luan Lin, a sophomore from the Department of Life Science,Nankai University. As a cooperator of wet lab and operator of interlab, she spends most of her iGEM days doing experiments.On the basis of her experience in other labs prior to iGEM, which inspires her ehthusiasm of biosynthesis, she makes positive contributions to the team and learns more about the tips and tricks for efficient research, thus she does appreciate for having the opportunity to participate in the project.Outside of iGEM, she enjoys drawing, reading and being in  nature.

I'm experiment group's member, Nankai university's sophomore(now is a junior student), Senhao Kou.iGEM can be a game for senior students while really a challenge for me, especially in such a busy and hot summer, experiments are challenging and time contribution can be confused, the result can be sometimes confused (It is really a nightmare for lab workers).Well I have to say interlab is so interesting and even funny (especially when I finish the chart). I also do something in HP part, walking around and visiting companies makes me understand researchers are so busy and high-producing (and poor when they find they failed the experiment...) At last,I really hope a happy and successful ending in iGEM.

Hi, I am Qiuhan Lang, a member of team NKU_China. With two years of biology learning, I have been attracted by the progress of exploring the mystery of life. At the same time, practicing communication and organization skills are also my wishes, so I am more than glad to join in the group of human practice in our team. I think scientific results should always be linked with social practical application, and what we are trying to do from human practice is to make research and social connect to each other closer.

I'm  Zixin Zhao. As a member of team NKU_CHINA, I mainly contribute to the art designing part.This is the first time that I have taken part in such an international competition. The synthetic biology reminds me of a way to create what we need by building smart pathways. And I really enjoy creating something from what I have learned and changing the world by doing that. So, I join the team and want to help the team with what I can do. I'd like to do my best to help my team  perform well and win the Grand prize.

Hi I am Wanru Zhang, a student majoring in life science in Nankai University. I am very interested in biological science so that I had started to get in touch with the experiments since I was in senior high school. Absolutely, in the team of NKU_CHINA, my work is relevant to the experiment part——making the design come into a real thing. About my personal experience, I have been in the student union, the 21th century youth union and the media center of the college in the first two years of my college life. Besides, I am an outgoing girl. And I really enjoy travelling and photography. I want to make friends with you.

Hi, my name is He Fanyang, a senior student from Nankai University. My passion for Biology started when I was in high school. That's why I chose Biology as my major. IGEM is such a perfect opportunity that I can learn more about what I like. Since I have learnt some experimental skills already, what I do in our team is experiment part. I feel I can learn so much and I am sure I will be better in this process.
