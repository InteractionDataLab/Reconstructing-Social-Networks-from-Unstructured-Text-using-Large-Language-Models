Because of some nongenetic differences, different cells in a single colony will have considerable variations in protein and metabolite concentrations. Based on this, PopQC was designed as a plasmid-based gene circuit, which continuously selects high-producers to increase production.</P><P class="model_content">We first use ordinary differential equations to demonstrate that the concentration of intracellular glutamate can vary in a wide range in different cells and stay stable because of two feedback suppression networks, which provides a theoretical basis for our experiment. We then use biophysical model to simulate the biosynthetic performance of our system based on the inhibition effect of promoter's occupation by RNA polymerase. In this link, we find that with tetracycline added to the medium, mRNA distribution of <I>tetA</I> is significantly different in different cells because the intracellular glutamate concentrations are different. This means our system has high sensitivity, and tetracycline can be used to achieve separation of high-producers and low-producers effectively. Finally, we use our model to simulate the production increase and predict the best initial condition to get the maximum production. The result demonstrates that precise regulation of tetracycline concentration is needed near the critical point of production increase in industrial production. Here we also designed an interactive part to show the result dynamically.</P></H2><H3 class="content_header">Intracellular Glutamate and GltC Concentration Simulated by ODEs</H3></MAIN></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-12"><P style="color: white;font-size: 20px;margin-top: 5px;text-align: center;">Figure 1: Pattern diagram of PopQC based on our design</P></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-12"><P class="model_content">In our project, <I>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</I> LL3 was selected as the engineered strain introduced into the PopQC plasmid.

This result demonstrates why the concentration of glutamate can vary in a wide range and stay stable, which provides a theoretical basis for our experiment.</P><P class="model_content">However, we find that the intracellular GltC concentration is basically equivalent in different cells because of its self-negative feedback network. So is reasonable to assume that the concentration of GltC-Glu complex is only affected by different intracellular glutamate concentrations. The reaction equilibrium constant in Equation (9) is , so the concentration of GltC-Glu complex is proportional to glutamate concentration.
