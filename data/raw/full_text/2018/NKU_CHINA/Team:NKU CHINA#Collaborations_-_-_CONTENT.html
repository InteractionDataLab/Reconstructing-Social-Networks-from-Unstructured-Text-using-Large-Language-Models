They can get more information about this detecting chassis tolerance through this testing that the detecting chassis can work at a T<SUB>c</SUB> concentration of 0 to 200 µg/mL. And this collaboration would help them better to improve their detecting chassis in the project.

We went to Tianjin No. 13 Middle School to publicize the knowledge of synthetic biology, meanwhile, to understand the current situation of education about biology in middle schools.</P><P class="col_content">This is a very meaningful publicity; students are very interested in what we introduced. Many of them heard these for the first time and can't wait to participate in the competition. We gave some guidance to them and tried our best to help their school build up an iGEM team.</P><P class="col_content">As one of our contributions to the promotion of synthetic biology, we decided to make this popularization of science as an annual event.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><H2 class="col_h2" style="color: #FFD600;">5.

The popularization of science was as important as the innovation of science and technology. It was the wings of innovation and development. We took synthetic biology as the foothold of science popularization and participated in the popularization of science together, which greatly improved the depth and breadth of science popularization and strengthened the inheritance of synthetic biology.

This event aimed to promote communication and cooperation between nine universities iGEM teams, and at the same time carry out science popularization to show the charm and essence of iGEM. This was the first time that NKU-CHINA successfully conceived and held this large-scale collaboration activity. Each team introduced their experiments and look for teams that can cooperate according to our needs, the exchange atmosphere was warm and reflected a good collision of thoughts.</P><P class="col_content">What’s more, to show the charm and essence of iGEM, and at the same time to better promote iGEM and synthetic biology among college students so that more people can focus on synthetic biology and participate in iGEM, each team introduced their experiments and preliminary work about synthetic biology on the basis of a common theme. After the report, the teams also answered the audience’s questions one by one in front of their own exhibition boards, expanding the public's understanding of synthetic biology.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN><FOOTER><DIV class="container-fluid myFooter"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-4 footer-w3ls"><H3 style="color: white; font-size: 30px;">Contacts</H3><H3 style="color: white; font-size: 30px;">Address</H3><ADDRESS style="color: white; font-size: 17px;">
