Overview
Poverty in taking reliable and repeatable measurements remains a key obstacle in establishing synthetic biology as an engineering discipline. The Measurement Committee has been studying the measurement procedure for green fluorescent protein (GFP) over the last several years by interlab. The most commonly used markers though GFP is in synthetic biology, labs often resort to making relative comparisons, which makes it difficult for labs to share and data and/or constructs.
The goal of the fifth iGEM InterLab Study is to identify and correct the sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology measurements by answering the question "Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD? "
As we know in the previous study, the fluorescence value measured by a plate reader is an aggregate measurement of an entire population of cells, we need to divide the total fluorescence by the number of cells in order to determine the mean expression level of GFP per cell. Due to the fact that the "optical density (OD)" of the sample is an approximation of the number of cells varying from lab to lab, we decided to use a special silica beads that are roughly the same size and shape as a typical E. coli cell to set up a universal, standard "equivalent concentration of beads" measurement.

Results
OD600 Reference Point
According to the Reference OD600, We calculate the final result:
OD600/Abs600=3.818
All cell density readings using this instrument with the same settings and volume can be converted to OD600, so that we can use this ratio to convert subsequent experimental data.
Particle Standard Curve
We prepare a dilution series of monodisperse silica microspheres and measure the Abs600 in plate reader. The size and optical characteristics of these microspheres are similar to cells, and there is a known amount of particles per volume. This measurement allows us to construct a standard curve of particle concentration which can be used to convert Abs600 measurements to an estimated number of cells.
The final result:
mean of med-high levels=6.24E+08
Fluorescein Standard Curve
We prepare a dilution series of fluorescein in four replicates and measure the fluorescence in a 96 well plate in plate reader. By measuring these we generate a standard curve of fluorescence for fluorescein concentration. We will be able to use this to convert our cell based readings to an equivalent fluorescein concentration.
Final results:
Mean µM fluorescein / a.u.=3.60E-05
MEFL / a.u.=2.17E+08
