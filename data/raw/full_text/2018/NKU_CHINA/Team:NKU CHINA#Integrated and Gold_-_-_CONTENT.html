Novozymes and other biotech companies chose to produce polymers to form new materials that ultimately increased their added value. At the same time, glutamate was also a very important substance in cells. What’s more, the use of surfactants was very extensive. As a reason of the current production technology could not form large-scale industrial production, no wonder that the price was high; γ-PGA could be industrialized, but the current production cost is very high, resulting in its price was also very high.</P><P style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">Based on our findings, we finally chose to use intracellular glutamate to synthesize surfactin and γ-PGA to verify the feasibility of our project.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><H2 style="color: white;font-size: 50px;text-align: center;" class="col-xs-12">Questionnaire Analysis</H2><DIV class="col-xs-12"><P style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">In the analysis process,we tried to find the relationship between the two questions &quot;Do you understand the use of surfactin and gamma-polyglutamic acid?&quot; and &quot;Do you think that the intelligent metabolic pathway we are studying meets the needs of current production and research?&quot;. Therefore, we performed the cross-over analysis. The analysis results show that the majority of people who understand the use of both products believe that our intelligent metabolic pathways meet current needs, but need to be improved; while people who do not understand our products have listened to our explanations and believe that this intelligent metabolic pathway is in line with current needs very significantly,which also reflected that our publicity is very effective.</P><DIV class="box"><DIV class="box-content"><H4 class="title">The Result of the Investigation</H4><UL class="description list-unstyled"><LI>Do you think our method can meet the needs of current development and production?</LI><LI>22.55%: Very consistent, optimistic about the results</LI><LI>66.63%: Yes, but need constant improvement</LI><LI>7.84%: Does not fit well, need innovative design</LI><LI>0.98%: No consistent, new experimental routes need to be designed</LI></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV class="box"><DIV class="box-content"><H4 class="title">The Result of the Investigation</H4><UL class="description list-unstyled"><LI>Do you konw about the production and application of these two kinds of things?</LI><LI>46.08%: Do not know much about it</LI><LI>28.43%: Knowing little about it</LI><LI>21.57%: Knowing</LI><LI>3.92%: Knowing it well</LI></UL></DIV></DIV><P style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">We compared the answers of the same questions pre- and post- presentation. In fact, More people have realized that our intelligent metabolic approach is feasible, at least in terms of ideas that are very consistent with current needs.
            In addition, many people expressed concerns about biosafety and the use of antibiotic, which will be showed in the pages of Human Practice and Safety.</P><DIV class="box"><DIV class="box-content"><H4 class="title">The Result of the Investigation</H4><UL class="description list-unstyled"><LI>What's your attitude towards the use of antibiotics?</LI><LI>47.06%: Expressing concern because antibiotics are overused at present</LI><LI>39.22%: It is necessary to use reasonably under normal supervision</LI><LI>12.75%: Expressing optimism and it can be used normally</LI><LI>0.98%: Must stop using it as it may produce super bacteria</LI></UL></DIV></DIV><P style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">The questionnaire is issued in Chinese statistics, for the convenience of reading, all of them are translated into English.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV id="survey2" class="modal fade" tabindex="-1"><DIV class="modal-dialog"><DIV class="modal-content"><DIV class="modal-footer"><BUTTON class="btn btn-primary" style="background: rgba(0,0,0,.80);" data-dismiss="modal">Close</BUTTON></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><H2 style="color: white;font-size: 50px;text-align: center;" class="col-xs-12">Communication Improvement</H2><DIV class="col-xs-12"><H4 style="color: white;font-size: 30px;">Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology</H4><P style="color: white;font-size: 20px;">In order to improve the experimental techniques and ideas, we went to Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology to exchange and study on August 21<SUP>th</SUP>, 2018.
