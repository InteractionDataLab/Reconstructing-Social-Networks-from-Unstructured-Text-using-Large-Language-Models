Collaborations
1. Cooperate with Team TUST_China About Experiments
Team TUST_China offered us their constructive detecting chassis to test the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), in different labs. They can get more information about this detecting chassis tolerance through this testing that the detecting chassis can work at a Tc concentration of 0 to 200 µg/mL. And this collaboration would help them better to improve their detecting chassis in the project. The result is presented below:

2. Cooperate with Team UESTC -Software About Wiki
In the wiki exchange group in China, we had the honor to get acquainted with the team of University of Electronic Science and Technology (UESTC-Software) and we provided some useful helps for them to build their wiki pages and they shared their experiences with us. At their invitation, we used the database established by their team to query the wiki page design of previous teams and some other statistics useful to us. Finally, we gave them some appropriate suggestions on how to improve the database.
3. Cooperate with Team Peking About Modeling
iGEM team Peking comes from Peking University. We discussed our projects during the joint conference we held in Nankai University. And they provided us with many valuable suggestions in mathematical modeling during the 5th Conference of the China iGEMer Community (CCiC). We keep a long-term communication with Peking since then and has benefitted from them a lot.
4. Publicize Synthetic Biology with Team TUST_CHINA and Team Tianjin
After meticulous preparation, NKU-CHINA held a science popularization activity for senior high school students together with team TUST_CHINA and team Tianjin . We went to Tianjin No. 13 Middle School to publicize the knowledge of synthetic biology, meanwhile, to understand the current situation of education about biology in middle schools.
This is a very meaningful publicity; students are very interested in what we introduced. Many of them heard these for the first time and can't wait to participate in the competition. We gave some guidance to them and tried our best to help their school build up an iGEM team.
As one of our contributions to the promotion of synthetic biology, we decided to make this popularization of science as an annual event.
5. Cooperate with Team OUC-China
When attending the CCiC conference, we met OUC-China fortunately and collaborate with them in public education and science popularization.
OUC-China provided a science brochure about synthetic biology we used when we promoted synthetic biology in Tianjin’s Middle Schools. The popularization of science was as important as the innovation of science and technology. It was the wings of innovation and development. We took synthetic biology as the foothold of science popularization and participated in the popularization of science together, which greatly improved the depth and breadth of science popularization and strengthened the inheritance of synthetic biology. This is an innovative cooperation.
6. iGEM League Conference in Beijing-Tianjin Region
On September 16th, NKU-CHINA participated in the iGEM league conference in Beijing-Tianjin region. We communicated our experiments and cooperated with other teams. In addition, we invited teachers from the Institute of Biophysics to guide the work of various iGEM teams, who are expert in modeling.
After our discussion, we decided to form a league to hold such a meaningful activity annually. Furthermore, we would do our best to apply for National Science Popularization Day with the help of the league.
7. The iGEM University Joint Conference in Nankai University
On July 6th, we held the iGEM University Joint Conference in Nankai University . This event aimed to promote communication and cooperation between nine universities iGEM teams, and at the same time carry out science popularization to show the charm and essence of iGEM. This was the first time that NKU-CHINA successfully conceived and held this large-scale collaboration activity. Each team introduced their experiments and look for teams that can cooperate according to our needs, the exchange atmosphere was warm and reflected a good collision of thoughts.
What’s more, to show the charm and essence of iGEM, and at the same time to better promote iGEM and synthetic biology among college students so that more people can focus on synthetic biology and participate in iGEM, each team introduced their experiments and preliminary work about synthetic biology on the basis of a common theme. After the report, the teams also answered the audience’s questions one by one in front of their own exhibition boards, expanding the public's understanding of synthetic biology.
