We built a bridge between iGEM and the public.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-8" style="margin-top: 20px;"><H4 style="color: white;text-align: center;font-size: 30px;">Investigation and Propaganda in Western China</H4><P style="color: white;font-size: 20px;line-height: 28px;">To investigate the education and the popularization of biological science in western China, we went to Yinchuan, Ningxia from August 1st to August 7th, 2018. We went to Minning Middle School to teach students some funny knowledge about synthetic biology. Through the research, we found that people in the western China knew little about biological knowledge, and we need to increase publicity and popular science.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-8" style="margin-top: 20px;"><H4 style="color: white;text-align: center;font-size: 30px;">Synthetic Biology Propaganda in Tianjin No.13 Middle School</H4><P style="color: white;font-size: 20px;line-height: 28px;">After meticulous preparation, three iGEM teams came from Nankai University, Tianjin University and Tianjin University of Science and Technology went to Tianjin No.13 Middle School to publicize the knowledge of synthetic biology and iGEM, meanwhile, to understand the current situation of education about biology in middle schools.” While these students have only been exposed to biology for a year, they like it very much”, the teacher said.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12" style="margin-top: 20px;"><H4 style="color: white;text-align: center;font-size: 30px;">Biological Science Popularization Day in Nankai University</H4></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-12" style="margin-top: 20px;"><P style="color: white;font-size: 20px;line-height: 28px;">In order to show the charm and essence of iGEM, and at the same time to better promote iGEM and synthetic biology among college students so that more people can focus on synthetic biology and participate in iGEM, we have organized the science popularization report on July 7th, team NKU-CHINA, Jilin_China and TUST_China took part in the publicity. Each team introduced their respective experiment directions and preliminary work with the synthetic biology as a common theme. After the report, outside the venue, the teams also answered the audience’s questions one by one in front of their own exhibition boards, expanding the public's understanding of synthetic biology, iGEM competition and experiment projects. Finally, the iGEM team of Nankai University organized a visit to the iGEM lab to get more closer with iGEM and our experiments. Through our publicity, many students showed great interest in synthetic biology, which is a meaningful publicity.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container hpborder" style="margin-top:10px;"><DIV class="row"><H2 style="color: white;font-size: 3em;text-align: center;margin-top:0px;padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:20px;margin-bottom:0px;" class="col-xs-12">Team Communication</H2><DIV class="col-xs-12" style="margin-top: 0px;"><H4 style="color: white;text-align: center;font-size: 30px;margin-top:0px;padding-top:10px;">The iGEM University Joint Conference in Nankai University</H4></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-12" style="margin-top: 20px;"><P style="color: white;font-size: 20px;line-height: 28px;">On July 6th, we held the iGEM University Joint Conference in Nankai University. This event aimed to promote communication and cooperation between various universities teams, and at the same time carry out science popularization to show the charm and essence of iGEM. This was the first time that our school iGEM team successfully conceived and held this large-scale joint conference. Each team introduced their experiments and other aspects of the work. After the show, we discussed our experiments and look for teams that can cooperate according to our needs, the exchange atmosphere was warm and reflected a good collision of thoughts. Finally, we organized everyone to visit our iGEM Lab to get a better understanding about our experiments.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12" style="margin-top: 20px;"><H4 style="color: white;text-align: center;font-size: 30px;">TEAM NPU-China</H4></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-12" style="margin-top: 20px;"><P style="color: white;font-size: 20px;line-height: 28px;">When we visited Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, we happened to meet Team NPU-China. We discussed our experiment and Human Practice and put forward some suggestions about their project. At the same time, we told them that we had some problems in Tet A gene expression recently. Fortunately, they suggested that we should communicate with team XJTU-China because our projects were very similar. Through their suggestions, we successfully communicated with team XJTU-China and improved our experiments. What a wonderful experience!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12" style="margin-top: 20px;"><H4 style="color: white;text-align: center;font-size: 30px;">CCiC</H4></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-12" style="margin-top: 20px;"><P style="color: white;font-size: 20px;line-height: 28px;">The 5th CCiC Conference was held in Shanghai University of Science and Technology from August 27 to 31. More than 60 teams from China participated in the Conference. The conference is divided into two parts: presentation and posters. Teammates of NKU_CHINA listened carefully to each team's statement and learned their advantages and our wonderful show was so Brilliant that many teams communicated with us. In the evening, all the teams are showing their unique design posters. However, our poster attracted a large group of people to seek cooperation. Thanks to our excellent presentation and poster display, we won the best Poster Award, which was a great encouragement for us. After the meeting, we exchanged views and ended our travel to CCiC meeting with a group photo. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-8" style="margin-top: 20px;"><H4 style="color: white;text-align: center;font-size: 30px;">TEAM OUC-China</H4><P style="color: white;font-size: 20px;line-height: 28px;">When attending the CCiC conference, we met OUC-China fortunately and cooperated with them in public education and science popularization.OUC-China team provided a science brochure about synthetic biology we used when we promoted synthetic biology in Tianjin’s Middle Schools. The popularization of science was as important as the innovation of science and technology. It was the wings of innovation and development. We took synthetic biology as the foothold of science popularization and participated in the popularization of science together, which greatly improved the depth and breadth of science popularization and strengthened the inheritance of synthetic biology. This is an innovative cooperation. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-8" style="margin-top: 20px;"><H4 style="color: white;text-align: center;font-size: 30px;">Science Popularization Lotus Festival</H4><P style="color: white;font-size: 20px;line-height: 28px;">For further collaboration in this and next year , our six universities in Beijing and Tianjin (BNU NKU THU TJU TUST UCAS) had this meet-up together in  China institute of biophysics on September 16, In this conference we talked about our experiental plans and HP cooperations in the future. At last we all agree that there should be more relationship among us , we can find more oppotunities in spreading synthetic biology knowledge to senior and junior high schools and use others experimental facilities in next year's experimental part.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN><FOOTER><DIV class="container-fluid myFooter"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-4 footer-w3ls"><H3 style="color: white; font-size: 30px;">Contacts</H3><H3 style="color: white; font-size: 30px;">Address</H3><ADDRESS style="color: white; font-size: 17px;">
