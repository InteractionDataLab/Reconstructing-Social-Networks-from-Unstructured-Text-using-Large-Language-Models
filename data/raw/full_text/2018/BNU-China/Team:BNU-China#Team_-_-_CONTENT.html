He made contributions during the brain strom and collected much information to create the taem's project. In this year's project, he mainly focused on the wet experiment, firstly, he lead his group to build up a plasmid which can make the E.coli produce the salicylic acid. Then they used HPLC to measure the yield of the salicylic acid. What's more, they designed a new way to help E.coli grow better by using VHB and the TorA signal sequence. After that, they combined with another group to build up the plasmid with CI system and explore its effect. At last, they tried their best to fuse all our basic parts to create the final part. He also acted as an associate in many other tasks, including the HP activities, modoling, collaboration, etc.
