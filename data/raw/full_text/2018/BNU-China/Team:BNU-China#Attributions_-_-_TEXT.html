Hello，This is BNU-China.
There are 28 team members this year, 18 of which learning life science, 2 of which learning mathematics, 2 of which learning physics, 4 of which learning information science and technology, and also we have a student learning chemistry and a student major in art.
We had a great year together, from the brainstorming at the beginning to intensive experiments, and finally we wrote draft and made wiki. IGEM brought us not only skills, but also a group of friends who could fight together. This Attribution page is to document all the effort.

What We Have Accomplished
The whole team could be divided into 5 groups: wet lab group, modeling group, human practice group, wiki group and art design group.
Shaobo Yang, Wei Zhang, Min Wei are the team leaders, they have worked together to manage the whole process.
Wei Zhang, Ranfei Fu, Miao Yang have found the novel growth factor GDH and found the way to produce SA. Shaobo Yang, Zhe Feng measured the growth curve of GDH. Kefan Fang, Quyi Jiang, Shujuan Jiang detected the interaction between emrR and PemrR. Kefan Fang alse constructed the final plasmid and worked on the modeling collaboration with HBUT. Shaobo Yang, Yadi Liu, Yang Miao have successfully measured the degeneration rate of GDH and constructed one of the final SAM plasmids. Wei Zhang，Ranfei Fu, Kecheng Zhang, Yuanxu Jiang have detected the function of CI and constructed the final plasmid. Min Wei, Yunzhu Meng, Xiaohan Shao have working on yeast display and the VHB-plasmids growth curve, TGATG expression rate, GDH protein detection. Chenyu Liu, Anqing Duan were working on all those parts.
Zhiruo Wang, Shangyang Li, Sirui Chen, Ziqin Yue constituted the modeling group and showed the GDH growth curve model, the TGATG expression model and the SA-emrR model.
Yue Peng, Yunzhu Meng, Yadi Liu, Min Wei, Zhe Feng, Kecheng Zhang have done a great achievement in human practice. They helped us put our result into the reality.
Yuxuan Fan, Shuhan Hu, Anlin Chen, Yuhang Wu were all producing our wiki. Shujuan Jiang, Jiajing Li, Qianxi Li have worked on the art design and the great collaboration between UCAS.
