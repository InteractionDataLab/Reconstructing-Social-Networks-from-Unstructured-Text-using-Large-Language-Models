Introductory courses
Since we came from a special college for teachers, we wanted our goals for the event to inspire more people to get involved in science. The head of the program emphasized that we should try to get students interested in the field of molecular biology and participating in research in college. Every summer, Beijing normal university hosts an education campaign for bachelors of all major to learn iGEM and do basic biological experiments, in order to arise their curiosity of synthetic biology and life science. The BNU-China iGEM teams always collaborate with the School of Education in the past to do teaching activities with students, so we launched a series of introductory course for new students, and invited them to visit our lab.
The courses include 4-week training of basic theory, two molecular biology experiments, and a mini-iGEM meeting. To guarantee the quality of these courses, we chose four of our best teammates and rehearsed privately for several times. Moreover, we made thorough plans and got the full rights from both college leaders and former iGEMers, each of whom assigned a team of freshers matched according to students’ speciality. The mentors monitored the study pace of each student by weekly meetings and students responded to learn the required materials. The courses were liked by most of apprentices. More importantly, we had a real bonus that we met two excellent students with both talent and enthusiasm, and they were absorbed in our iGEM team to make greater contribution.

The problem of degradation always lies in industrial production, whereas the abuse of antibiotics has lead to the emerge of antibiotic-resistant superbugs. It's the researchers' responsibility to deal with this safety issues raised by                     the interaction between the application and the human society. Our iGEM project aims at the application of self-screening advantageous mutant selection, which can provide a growth dominance to the strains with beneficial mutation.                     As a result, we conducted an biosafety-investigation about the medical application of antibiotics in FuXing Hospital, Capital University. Besides, we participated in a series of academic conferences, during which we exchanged our ideas                     with other participants and sought out for chances of collaboration.

Frankly speaking, popular science about biology is quite inadequate, causing many students in rural areas unable to scratch the surface of biology until senior high. As a result, during the summer vacation, our team members went to three country schools in Jiangxi and Ningxia Province for volunteer work and brought biology to younger students.
BNU-China organized a seminar class and shared anecdotes about biotechnology with children from several villages. In the active class, team members held a heated discussion involving transgenosis and environmental protection that people concerned and we got established a long-term friendly relation of cooperation with OUC-China, who helped us with the comic book about synthetic biology. The book exhibited the complex biology model and principle with funny comics, making it more easier for students initial contact. Besides daily activities, we also conducted an interview about their fancy ways of education. Most students responded that they were looking forward to participating in scientific experiments, but had laboured under the disadvantage of not having enough equipment. Their words went directly to the heart, finding their support in the understanding. Grown up in cities, we had no idea of strong thirst for knowledge of rural children. From then on, we were deeply determined to create a revolutionary new way of science popularization, ameliorating the poor condition and offering these lovely students opportunities to a better future.
Having been back to our laboratory, we held a series of conferences, coming up with ideas on how to popularize synthetic biology intended for demonstrations at low cost.At the beginning, we planned to help students to get a deeper understanding of synthetic biology in the means of lecture, but soon changed our mind for the teaching practice with local high school students who reported that this form would be boring for the public. Then we thought of, a mimic electrocircuitt relying on the gene pathway would offer a great advantage of viewable and intuitive understanding of the core idea of synthetic biology. And it can inspire people to participate in gene-designing process.
As a result, we used e-SAM© system, an ideal analog model to expound the definition of synthetic biology, applying engineering structures to build artificial biological systems for research, engineering and medical applications. We also drafted a detailed description of experiments that can be performed with e-SAM© system as well as suggestions for customers. The one-to-one match between e-SAM© system and the biology parts are shown below.
Based on this year’s igem project, self-screening for advantageous mutants, we designed the first electronic model for synthetic biology.

In our parts, target genes interposed in MCS can co-express the following growth factor via the TGATG linkage. This logical circuit is devised to represent the control relationship between genes.

Then, we opened a DIY class for high school students and successfully mocked up the first type of e-SAM model.

With the help of e-SAM system, we can demonstrate gene-expression with modifying the switches.
Visit and feedback from high school teachers
In September, the team welcomed students from several high schools nearby and freshers in BNU, who had interests in biology and the willing to introduce our model to their friends. A few days later we received encouraging students’ responses from SanFan and other departments of BNU, who gave a high appraisal to our engineering model and told us to provide them with a more detailed proposal as soon as we would have it ready.
As a result, in October, several high school teachers from SanFan came to BNU to meet with our team to discuss the possible integration of our e-SAM system in their high school's biology curriculum. We provided them a live demonstration of how the e-SAM system works and we discussed the impact it would have on the high school courses of normal students heatedly. The teachers responded to us that one of the most disturbing questions about science curriculum was the lack of facilities. Many essential science instruments such as centrifuge can be too dangerous and too expensive for high school provide. They e-SAM system can make great contribution at teaching-cost reduction, worthy to spread across high school education.
