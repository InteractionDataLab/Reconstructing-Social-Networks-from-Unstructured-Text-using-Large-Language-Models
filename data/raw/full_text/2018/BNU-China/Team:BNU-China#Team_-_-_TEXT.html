Kecheng Zhang
Kecheng Zhang is in his third year of life science. He carries on we lab process, mainly focusing on the construction and analysis of CI-activator system. Besides daily laboratory work, he also organized voluntary-teaching program and conducted a series of interviews with different experts. He is delighted to be an igemer and honor to be a part a member of this passionate family.

Wei Zhang
Wei Zhang is a junior of Beijing Normal University whose major is biology science. He is one of the leader in this team who worked with the other two leaders to make sure the team work well. He made contributions during the brain strom and collected much information to create the taem's project. In this year's project, he mainly focused on the wet experiment, firstly, he lead his group to build up a plasmid which can make the E.coli produce the salicylic acid. Then they used HPLC to measure the yield of the salicylic acid. What's more, they designed a new way to help E.coli grow better by using VHB and the TorA signal sequence. After that, they combined with another group to build up the plasmid with CI system and explore its effect. At last, they tried their best to fuse all our basic parts to create the final part. He also acted as an associate in many other tasks, including the HP activities, modoling, collaboration, etc.

I can learn many things about biology in our lab, this is what I am always interested in. but In fact, I am not so good at doing experiments, but I like graphic design. I try to bring a visual impact to our project, thinking I am creative enough to do it.
I designed the ccic poster, banner and the pictures in wiki. Most importantly, I designed the logo of BNU-China, which will be used ever after.
I hope you enjoy my works.
