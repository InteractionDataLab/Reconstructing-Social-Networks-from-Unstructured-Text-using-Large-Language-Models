USAFA iGEM Design
Design
For the first stage of this larger project, the USAFA iGEM team has created a vector that produces the protein mRuby and a transcript of the WOR1 5' UTR.  The vector was designed using the MoClo kit and assembled via Golden Gate assembly.  The team has successfully transformed this vector into E. coli and S. cerevisiae.  Eventually, the team's goal is to create a vector that can be transformed into C. albicans and prevent C. albicans from undergoing a phenotypic switch and becoming virulent.  The vector would do this by generating a surplus of binding sites for the translational promoters that bind to the transcript of the WOR1 5' UTR.
