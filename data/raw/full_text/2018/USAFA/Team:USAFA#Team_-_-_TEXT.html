His research focus includes RNA-binding proteins and their regulation of post-transcriptional gene expression. His previous work included determining the pathogenesis of Alphaviruses. In particular, he determined the stability of host mRNAs during viral infections and what effects RNA-binding proteins had on the post-transcriptional control of these mRNAs. In addition to teaching core biology, he is the lead mentor for USAFA’s iGEM team.
Dr. Bates
Katherine Bates, Ph.D., is an Assistant Professor of Biology at USAFA.
