WOR1 Regulatory Protein Binding Sequence
BBa_K2732000
This part is a protein binding sequence cloned from the 5' UTR of the WOR1 gene found in Candida albicans. The proteins that bind to this sequence regulate the expression of the WOR1 gene so we expect this sequence to disrupt the expression of WOR1 ; however, the activity of this sequence has not been characterized in Candida albicans yet. The WOR1 gene is the master phenotypic regulator in Candida albicans . The expression of WOR1 drives Candida albicans to the opaque phenotype which is tied to its pathogenicity, in most reported cases.
