Our work then turned to successfully sub-cloning our new parts (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2589000">BBa_K2589000</A>, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2589002">BBa_K2589002
</A>) from the pETail4 plasmid containing the lambda phage genome into both pTrc99a and pSB1C3 along with improving a past part <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2452002">BBa_K2452002</A> to create the composite part <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2589001">BBa_K2589001</A>. Our final focus in WetLab was to purify the proteins from our new parts using Nickel column purification (as most of our parts contain a His tag element) and then confirming expression or protein presence. </P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md"><H1>Part Design</H1><P> Our Wet Lab team and Dr. Werner met early in the year to discuss the full spectrum of possible parts we would attempt to create and submit, and as with many iGEM teams we set our goals a bit too high, hoping to create a series of fusion proteins with which to better analyze our test kit on top of the basic parts needed for our system. We analyzed the sequence of the pTrc99a plasmid and decided to use the trc-promoter <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2042004">BBa_K2042004</A> for induction of all of our lambda phage tail protein parts with IPTG. Because the part sample for this promoter has not been released, primers had to be designed to input our parts into the pTrc99a backbone and then further clone our parts into pSB1C3 with the trc-promoter from the pTrc99a backbone.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg"><P>The basic parts we designed at the beginning of our project include <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2589000">BBa_K2589000</A> and <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2589002">BBa_K2589002</A>, and an improved composite part <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2589001">BBa_K2589001</A> consisting of <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2452002">BBa_K2452002</A> and <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2042004">BBa_K2042004</A>. Dr. Werner helped us design our primers in a major way ensuring our sequences were accurate and should work as expected. We did run into some problems with low gene amplification during PCR and ended up increasing the size of our original primers by 1bp. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-lg"><H1>Cloning</H1><P>We followed standard procedures for the cloning of our parts, first amplifying our genes of interest by PCR, digesting and ligating our parts into our backbone(s), and transformation via electroporation into electrocompetent lab strain <I>E. coli</I>. Successful transformants underwent initial screening through diagnostic restriction enzyme digests to confirm the presence of our plasmid backbones and appropriate genes.</P><P>When diagnostic digests showed high potential for a successful clone, samples were sent for sequencing to (in most cases) confirm the presence and accurate sequence of our parts. We ran into numerous issues during cloning that slowed the progression of our lab work and project including poor gene amplification during PCR which was inevitably solved using slightly longer primers and a longer annealing time. Additionally, we had some unexpected initial sequencing data that confounded the situation, however, after additional screening we believe our part sequences to be accurate and complete. See <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:WLC-Milwaukee/Demonstrate">Results</A> for data and the results of our cloning</P></DIV><DIV class="col-lg"><H1>Protein Expression and Purification</H1><P>After confirmation of successful cloning of our parts, we began the process of protein purification. Strains with successful clones were cultured and then diluted and induced using IPTG for maximal protein expression. Our proteins were purified using a Nickel column purification kit/system from Qiagen (Ni-NTA Fast Start Kit) after which a series of tests (some successful some not) were performed in an attempt to confirm the presence and functionality of our purified proteins, including PAGE gels with Coomassie Staining. We then proceeded to conjugate Horseradish peroxidase to our protein samples and performed His-tag specific Western Blotting and chemiluminescent tests (using our parts combined with various diluted cultures of <I>E.coli</I> and exposed to a chemiluminescent substrate cleaved by HRP) to confirm the purification, conjugation of HRP to, and binding of, our proteins to <I>E.coli</I>.
