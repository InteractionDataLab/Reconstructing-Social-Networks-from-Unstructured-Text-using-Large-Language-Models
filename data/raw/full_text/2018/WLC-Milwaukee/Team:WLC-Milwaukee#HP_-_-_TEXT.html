Human Practices
The WLC-iGEM Team has historically taken Human Practices Investigation, Public Engagement, and Collaboration with other teams and the public very seriously. We are continually inspired by the work of other iGEM teams to increase both public engagement with the scientific process and improve public education on the topics of bioengineering and genetic modification.  To learn more about how our Human Practice Investigations influenced the development of our project, or how as a team we have set out to educate and integrate science into the public eye, see below!
