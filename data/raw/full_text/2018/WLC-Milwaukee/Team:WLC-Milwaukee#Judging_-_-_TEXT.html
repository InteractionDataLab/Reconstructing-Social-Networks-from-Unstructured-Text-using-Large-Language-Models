Achievements

star_borderAs a team, we registered for iGEM, had a great summer, and  attended the Giant Jamboree in Boston, MA.
star_borderAs a team, we finished our Wiki, submitted our Judging form, completed our Poster, and presented at the Jamboree.
star_borderWe clearly laid out the work done by students on the team, advisors, our Wiki design collaborators, ensuring every individual and group involved in our project has been credited for their work on our Attributions page.
star_borderWe improved the characterization of two existing biobrick parts, namely BBa_K1900002 (E. coli tolC) and BBa_K1291571 (Horse Radish Peroxidase Type C).

star_halfOur team designed and tested the function of a new part BBa_K2589000 and a new composite part BBa_K2589002 based on BBa_K2589000 with the addition of the trc-promoter ( BBa_K2042004 ). The expression and functionality of these parts was analyzed and presented on the appropriate pages in the Registry.
star_halfWe were able to Collaborate in a significant way with the 2018 Cornell iGEM Team by receiving mentoring and materials that have improved our team function as we deal with a large influx of new members. We have also provided data regarding water safety and Outreach effectiveness through surveys to the IIT Kanpur iGEM team and the Copenhagen iGEM team.
star_halfWLC-iGEM spent a significant amount of time considering and analyzing the possible impact of our project on the community and environment, speaking with members of the public and water resource experts, and engaging a wide portion of our community in our project and Bioengineering through our Outreach efforts.

star WLC-iGEM was able to consider and integrate the advice and feedback of water experts and the conclusions of our human practice investigations into the design and scope of our project.
star We were able to improve a part from the 2017 WLC-iGEM Team by combining BBa_K2452002 with the trc-promoter regulatory element BBa_K2042004 to create BBa_K2589001 .
starWe were able to both build and perform initial testing of a prototype of our system, demonstrating that our testing system for E. coli, while in need of optimization, works as intended.
