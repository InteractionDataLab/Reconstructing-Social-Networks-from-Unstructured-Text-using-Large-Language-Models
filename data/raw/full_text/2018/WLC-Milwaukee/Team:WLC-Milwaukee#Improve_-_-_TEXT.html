WLC iGEM 2018 | Parts
Parts
The parts used in the 2018 WLC-Milwaukee iGEM project and testing of our E. coli detection system include both new coding and composite parts and improved parts from past WLC-iGEM Teams. We have also characterized several parts to improve their ability to be used in future projects by other iGEM teams and researchers.
