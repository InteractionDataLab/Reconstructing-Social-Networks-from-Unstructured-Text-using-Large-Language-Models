Our Team
2018 WLC iGem Team
The WLC-Milwaukee iGEM Team is made up of individuals from numerous backgrounds with varying levels of research experience all dedicated to improving scientific involvement  and communication with the community and contributing to the wider body of scientific research!
Our Team
Our team has grown substantially this Fall, so we wanted to take this opportunity to thank our newest team members for their enthusiasm and contributions to our Human Practices work and research!
This is my fourth and final year with the WLC-iGEM Team and               I have fully abandoned sleep in exchange for coffee and               endless PCR reactions. I spend most of my time in lab, but I also               organize and plan a large portion of our Human Practice and Outreach               events. If I had free time, I would spend it SCUBA diving or taking               care of my reef tank.

This is my second year on the team and I currently             oversee team administration. I am in charge of organizing             team meetings and some human practices events, although I do             enjoy lab work. Outside of iGEM, I research silver nanoparticles             and their effect on bacteria when used in conjunction with antibiotics.             All science aside, I like to rewatch episodes of The Office,             tell chemistry jokes, and hang out with my cousins.

This is my first full year with WLC-iGEM and most of my           work with the team has been in lab. After graduation I hope to           attend medical school and become a surgeon. In my free time I           enjoy golfing, ping pong, hiking, and movies.

Health Sciences '19
This is my second year as a part of WLC-iGEM and I help         out primarily with the laboratory work. In addition to iGEM,         I also work as a lab prep assistant to the biology professors         on campus. This past summer I worked in a lab researching         myoblast differentiation. When I’m not in the lab or studying,         you can usually find me spending time with my friends, reading,         exercising, shopping, or drinking coffee.

My name is Alyssa Leitzke and I am a sophomore Biology major,       minoring in Chemistry and Psychology. I joined iGEM this past       year and work in lab as well as on Human Practices. I hope to       continue working in lab to prepare for a career in neuroscience,       studying the biological basis of human behavior. In my free time       I enjoy playing piano and ukulele, golfing, and playing ping pong.

This is my first year on the WLC-iGEM team and I have       primarily assisted with lab work. I am excited to work alongside       a group of individuals imbued with different talents and are able       to work under a unified vision to contribute to advancements in       science. Outside of the lab, I serve as the coordinator for the       Junior Youth Empowerment Program that works with adolescent youth       who strive to better their communities.

This is my second year on the iGEM team and I have enjoyed       the lab experience and camaraderie that this team has provided.       My goal is to go to grad school and become a neuroscience researcher.       In my free time I love doing anything in the outdoors. When I'm not       in nature I enjoy baking, and singing.

My name is Marissa Schmitz and I am a Biology major with plans       to attend veterinary school. I spend most of my time with the team       in lab. I enjoy being a part of WLC-iGEM because I get to be a part       of a great group of people working together to make a difference in       the world. In my free time I enjoy watching sports games, reading,       and spending time with friends and family.

This is my first year on the WLC iGem team. I am interested in majoring in Media Design, and am assisting as the lead Graphic Designer this year. I have enjoyed working with everyone so far and look forward to future years of teamwork. When I am not helping with graphics, I enjoy working on my own art projects, whether that is drawing, painting, or ceramics
