Our team added several useful parts to the PhytoBrick registry, all of which are compatible for GoldenGate cloning. We are unable to submit level 1 composite phytobricks to the registry as they are held within the pGB-A2 phytobrick.
Therefore each of our submitted parts are in the PhytoBricks Universal Acceptor BBa_P10500 , and all but one are individual parts. The exception is BBa_K2810011, which is a part ordered as a composite gBlock and then introduced into BBa_P10500 .
Although they have not been submitted to the registry we have made and tested several composite level 1 PhytoBricks as well as adding data to existing phytobricks.
