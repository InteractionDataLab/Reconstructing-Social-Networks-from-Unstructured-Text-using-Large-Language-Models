Realised there was a miscommunication about what RCE is. Its part of a Ribitiol operon and isn't just a promoter, but a repressor as well. Decided to carry on with the Collaboration and testing anyway, as the results could be unusual (RC).
Grew up all constructs for glycerol stocks and dry DNA send-off (RC).
