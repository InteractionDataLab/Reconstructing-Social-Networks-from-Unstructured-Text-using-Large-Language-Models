Basic Parts
All of our basic parts are documented on this page. They are all GoldenGate compatible and contained within the pSB1C3 plasmid.
GUS reporter for plant expression (BBa_K2810001)
RTBV Vascular Specific Promotor (BBa_K2810002)
Full sequence for Myzus persisae BCR3 secreted protein (BBa_K2810003)
Complimentary sequence to Myzus persisae BCR3 secreted protein (BBa_K2810004)
Coding sequence from 5' end of the BCR3 gene sequence (BBa_K2810005)
Complimentary sequence from 5' region of the BCR3 gene (BBa_K2810006)
siRNA from 5' region of Myzus persicae SP3 secreted protein (BBa_K2810007)
siRNA* from 5' region of Myzus persicae SP3 secreted protein (BBa_K2810008)
mCherry, codon optimised for Nicotiana benthamiana (BBa_K2810009)
Regulatory region derived from the ribitol-responsive operon (BBa_K2810010)
WRKY intron for plant-targeted RNAi constructs (BBa_K2810000)
