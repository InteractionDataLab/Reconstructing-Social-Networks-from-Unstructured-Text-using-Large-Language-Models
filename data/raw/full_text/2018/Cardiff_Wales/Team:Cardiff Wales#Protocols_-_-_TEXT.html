Protocols
Level 0 digest/ligation reaction
This is a protocol for a level 0 digest/ligation reaction. Originally this was not run on a cycle as we were using BsmBI instead of Esp3I, which has an optimum temperature of 55 degrees Celsius, causing extreme disruption (but not complete denaturation) to T4 DNA ligase.
Set up a reaction mixture containing:
- 1.5μl 50ng acceptor plasmid (PUDP2)
- 3μl insert DNA
- 1μl T4 ligase
- 2.5μl T4 ligase buffer
- 1μl Esp3I

Place reaction mixtures into a thermocycler and set up a 30X cycle of 37°C for 10 minutes then 16°C for 10 minutes
Level 1 digest/ligation reaction
This is a protocol for a level 1 digest/ligation reaction.
Set up a reaction mixture containing:
- 100ng acceptor plasmid (PGB-A2)

Add 1/1000th volume antibiotic (Amp, Chl, Kan etc.) to the autoclaved container along with 1/1000th volume of X-Gal or IPTG if desired
Distributed finalised mixture equally between 16 petri dishes, making sure all the plates are completely covered and leave to set
Once set, store the plates at 4 °C until required
