Overview
A "Time-saving Machine" for Genetic Screening in Microfluidic Two-Cell System
With rapid development of Molecular and Cellular Biology, we know more about what's in a cell but still know little about how cells interact among populations. Cell-Cell Interactions form a complicated signaling network which is far beyond our imagination. Traditional method to study cell communication is cell coculture facing multiple variables changing which is time-consuming.
To revolutionize coculture method, we build a "time-saving machine" to study cell signaling networks based on genetically engineered Two-Cell system, a Secreting and a Responding cell. Wnt signaling pathway is one part of intercellular signaling networks. For proof-of-principle ,Wnt secreting cells are genetically modified for genetic screening and Wnt responding cells are inserted a TCF-GFP reporter construct for signal visualization.
The “time-saving machine” is a microfluidic double emulsion system . A secreting cell and a responding cell were encapsulated by the microfluidic system producing thousands of Two-Cell droplets at a time. Unlike traditional coculture method, this is time-saving. It is the first time to use high-throughput microfluidic systems for encapsulation of two mammalian cells in a microdroplets for cell coculture. The project results can be found here .
We build mathematical models of the genetic network in Wnt secretion and signaling, improving the understanding of the pathways as well as guiding experimental design.
