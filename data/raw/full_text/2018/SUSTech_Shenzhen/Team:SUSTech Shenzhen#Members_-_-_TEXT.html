Our team consists of sixteen undergraduate students, who come from different departments and contribute their time, creativity and skills to the project. And it is honored to receive lots of suggestions from a number of professors, PhD students and researchers in different groups from their own professional perspectives.

I am Loky who likes physics and biology. Table tennis is my favorite sport and I love reading about scientific history and Chinese culture.
Jinwei is our reliable team leader, connecting everyone to cooperate efficiently and holding the direction of the project. Heâ€™s curious about new knowledge and supportive to all other members.
Deng Daqi, major in bioscience, and I am interested in the complex perturbation network of cancer development. I am waiting for the inevitable booming of computational systems biology.
Daqi gradually learns how to be a leader this year. This promising boy shows his strong will to become better both in the academic domain and in life, which encouraging his fellows grow with him.
This is working Olivia, on genes, on life.
You can spot Wei from the smile on her face. She was previously in the Biology Department so she took part in lab work. This out-going girl would love to share her idea with others and set foot in different parts of the project.

Chen Shenzhi, major in bioinformatics, interested in cancer classification from the gene expression view, machine learning maybe an important tool in this job, I do hope that in future machine can play a more important role in system biology.
Shenzhi had a deep bioinformatics understanding and he is very nice to people surrounded him. I am glad to work with him even thought in our project. Modeling part is kind of messy with a noisy background.
I am Morty from SUSTech in China. I major in mechanics, but I am also interested in other natural sciences such as biology. In daily life, I play the guitar, badminton and other extracurricular activities.
Hongyong can always use his humor to activate the atmosphere while discussing, always being friendly and helpful. He was active in modeling and hardware part and did a good job in this part.
I am an outgoing boy studying for Statistic in SUSTech. In iGEM, I am charge of modeling part and take part in HP. Itâ€™s an extraordinary experience for me in iGEM since I enjoy discussing and doing research with such earnest teammates.
Zhuohang is a smart guy from the maths department who is optimistic and willing to help. Heâ€™s also an active member of the student union and other associations.

I'm lazy, accurate to say that I am a person afraid of trouble. Biological lovers bored with the experiment. An idealist with a realistic dream.
Kaiwen always became serious when talking about the biology experiments. Obviously, he loves biology a lot and is qualified as our experiment expert. Although heâ€™s quiet, we saw his hidden enthusiasm.
Hello, I am a sophomore from SUSTech, major in biology. Glad to participate in iGEM and I take responsibility in HP and experiments.
As an active member in both biology lab and HP, Luyao always view problems from a unique degree that others may not be aware of. We are lucky to have such a girl who can propose new opinions in the team.
I am Liu Xuetong. Lucky for me to enter the amazing biology kingdom. I'd like to say that never let an idea go without a fight, and always be optimistic and confident. Also, don't feel disappointed for long even if failed.
Xuetong likes funny things. She always likes to share ideas with others and give a hand to those who in need.

I am easy-going and major in bioscience and enjoy doing exploring new things.
Yuwei must be a peer you can easily get along with, since she tries her best to understand others and dedicates her effort into the tasks. Everyone likes her smile and impressed by her sense of responsibility as well as her contribution to the whole team.
A street-dance maniac. A penmanship addict. A normal person who thrives to be different.
The person who loves funk-style and amazes us with his dance in our team is Yujing. His enthusiasm inspires the members beside him while his sense of art and language made him the author of HP story teller of the team.
I am Qihao who donâ€™t have much to say. It is nice to meet you guys.
Qihao is good at judging the situation and keep pace with other students'work. With the courage to try new things.     He is able to set up the team website and use his academic skills to assist modeling part.

Iâ€™m Zhang Jiaqi, a girl whoâ€™s willing to know new things and listen to peopleâ€™s thoughts. Iâ€™m glad working with all other members of the team coming from different majors but holding enthusiasm in the minds.
+7 is very nice to cooperate with other team members. She always likes to take some challenges in a team.
I love MÃ¡rquez, Harry Potter, Sherlock Holmes, lasagna, music and biology, particularly interested in genetics.Live Long and May the Force be with Us.ðŸ––
Minyu is the sort of people that hold her own opinion and not easily go with the flow. She takes things seriously and gives observation judgment based on her own observation, which makes she a reliable peer of us.
Iâ€˜m Dong Haowen from the department of biomedical engineering. It's very happy for me to participate in iGEM_SUSTech and fight with everyone
Haowen is a passionate man who likes to try new things, and he likes to ask questions frequently.

Eason is the nickname of Tang Yisen. Eason is he. Eason is not good at self-introduction. Eason likes banana and Spain. Eason can`t sing.
Eason doesâ€™t like to talk much but is responsible for the team. He acted like an observer who can track the state of teamwork and raise our attention at the right time.

Dr. Liang Fang
Secondary PI
Department of Biology
Prof. Xin Cheng
Collaborator
Department of Material Sciences
Prof. Wei Chen is a chair professor in Systems Biology in Genetic Regulation. He provided a lot of useful instructions at the beginning of our project. Our team members have very close relationship with him and learn a lot from his methodology in Science.
Dr. Liang Fang is an expert in Wnt signaling pathway and Cancer development. We got lots of experimental skills and disciplines in research. We have regular discussions in our project progress and set up more rigorous experimental design.
We collaborated with Prof. Xin Chengâ€™s Lab for learning the fabrication of micro-well plates.
Dr. Chunhui Wu
