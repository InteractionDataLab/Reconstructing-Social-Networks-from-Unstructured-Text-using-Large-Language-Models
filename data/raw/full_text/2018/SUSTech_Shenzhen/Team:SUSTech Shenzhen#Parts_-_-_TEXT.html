Gold Medal
For Improvement in Gold Medal, we have improved the original GFP part ( BBa_E0040 ) with a TCF-TATA promoter, generating a perfect reporter system for WNT ligand in our project ( BBa_K2591014 ). It works as an improved reporter that could report even at a weak expression levels with higher efficiency. Also, we have improved the BGH polyA part ( BBa_K2217015 ) with two LoxP sites to make a switch by Cre ( BBa_K2591013 ) (Find more details in our part page here ). We provide those well characterized and validated improved parts to the iGEM community in the hope of a broad range of synthetic biology applications.

Silver Medal
For Validated Part in  Silver Medal, we added three parts ( BBa_K2591010 , BBa_K2591011 , and BBa_K2591012 ), consisting of gRNA of genes together with scaffold, all of which were well characterized, validated, and used in our project. (Find more details in our part page here )

Bronze Medal
For Characterization in Bronze Medal, we have characterized two parts, BBa_I714031 and BBa_K1592002 , and repaired    single errors in their sequences by artificial mutagenesis, which may potentially influence their function.
