How do cells whisper?
There are many different cells that communicate in our daily life.
A Secreting cell can send out the message and a Responding cell can receive a message.
To listen what they are talking, we set a small room for each of them.
We called it a "Block".
Thousand blocks are created for those two cells.
And they behave differently due to the diversity of their innate genes.
After a period of time, some cells who have good communication get a good idea to escape the block.
They ran out of the block and revealed the secret.
Finally, a form of communication is known to us, Wnt signaling.
