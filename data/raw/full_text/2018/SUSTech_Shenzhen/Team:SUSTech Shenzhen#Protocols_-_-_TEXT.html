Fibro Media warm
Hemocytometer with cover slip
Eppendorf pipettes
0.1% Trypan blue
Cell suspension
Microcentrifuge tube
Microscope
Procedure
1. Warm Fibro Media in water bath.
2. Spray down hood with alcohol.
3. Spray hemocytometer and cover slip with alcohol and allow to air dry.
4. Using appropriate Eppendorf pipettes, combine 450 ul of 0.1% trypan blue and 50 ul of suspended cells in a microcentrifuge tube. Mix well.
5. Inject 50 ul of trypan blue/cell mixture into each side of hemocytometer.
6. Count cells in 5 out of the 9 boxes of the grid using 10x objective with phase contrast. Only two of the four sides of a box should be counted. If a cell is stained blue, then it is dead and should not be counted.
7. Count both sides of the hemocytometer. Add the totals and multiply by 10,000 for amount of cells per ml.
8. Decide how many cells per ml of media are needed. Add appropriate amount of media for desired concentration of cells.
CRISPR gene modification
1. Acquire the genomic sequence of target gene from NCBI or other databases.
2. Identify the Exon containing the start codon (ATG) and find the sequence 100bp downstream of ATG.
3. Design sgRNA using online tool developed by Zhang Lab( Ran, et al, 2013).
4. Synthesize sgRNA oligos with the following format:
Top: 5’-CACCgNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN-3’
Bottom: 5’-AAACNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNc-3’
Note: Bbs1 enzyme digestion site. g is only added when the first base it not g.
5. Suspend oligos in H2O at 100 uM.
6. Anneal the oligos (20 ul):
Top:            9 ul
Bottom:      9 ul  
10X annealing buffer:     2 ul
Incubate at 95 oC for 5 min
Cool down to 25 oC at 5 oC/min
10X annealing buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl)
Then followed by Ligation in Molecular Cloning.
Cell Transfection
1. Cell seeding and Cell density at transfection. Cells should be plated 18–24 hours before transfection to ensure that the cells are actively dividing and reach the appropriate cell density (generally 70–90% confluence) at the time of transfection.
2. Cell passage number. It is critical to transfect primary cells at early passages.
3. DNA expression vector selection. Promoter (CMV vs. EF1α), type of GFP (Enhanced GFP vs. Emerald GFP) and size of expression vector (5 kb vs. 8 kb) dramatically affect transgene expression in particular cell types.
4. DNA Preparation. Plasmid DNA must be sterile and free from phenol and other contaminants.
5. Ratio of GeneXPlus Reagent to DNA. Depending on the cell type, the optimal ratio of DNA (μg) to GeneXPlus Transfection Reagent (μL) varies from 1:1 to 1:3. A DNA (μg) to reagent (μL) ratio of 1:2 is recommended as a starting point.
6. Complex formation conditions. Prepare GeneXPlus Transfection Reagent and DNA complexes in serum-free growth medium (e.g. Opti-MEM Medium).
7. Presence of antibiotics and other known inhibitors: Antibiotics can inhibit transfection complex formation and therefore should be excluded from the complex formation step. However, GeneXPlus has been optimized for intracellular delivery of nuclei acids into cultured mammalian cells in the presence of serum. Culture medium containing polyanions such as heparin, heparin sulfate or dextran sulfate can also inhibit transfection. Medium containing these chemicals should not be used for transfection; however, the medium can be replaced with medium containing polyanions 24 hours after transfection.
8. Post-transfection incubation time. The optimal incubation time is generally 24–72 hours post transfection, but will vary depending on the goal of the experiment, nature of the plasmid used, and cell doubling time.

Isotype Control Antibodies
Materials Required：
FACS™ Tubes (5 mL round-bottom polystyrene tubes)
Pipette Tips and Pipettes
Centrifuge
Vortex
Procedure
Sample preparation:
For staining peripheral blood cells, whole blood should be collected in evacuated tubes containing EDTA or heparin as the anticoagulant. Contaminating serum components should be removed by washing the cells three times in an isotonic phosphate buffer (supplemented with 0.5% BSA) by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 minutes. For staining cell lines or cells from activated cell cultures, the cells should be centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 minutes and washed three times in an isotonic PBS buffer (supplemented with 0.5% BSA) to remove any residual growth factors that may be present in the culture medium. Adherent cell lines may require pretreatment with 0.5 mM EDTA to facilitate removal from their substrates. Cells that require trypsinization to enable removal from their substrates should be further incubated in medium for 6-10 hours on a rocker platform to enable regeneration of the receptors. The use of the rocker platform will prevent reattachment to the substrate.
Note: Titration experiments should be performed to determine optimal reagent amounts.
Harvest cells and aliquot up to 1 x 106 cells/100 μL into FACS tubes. Fc-block cells with blocking IgG (1 μg IgG/106 cells) for 15 minutes at room temperature.
Note: Do not wash excess blocking IgG from this reaction.
Add conjugated antibody (10 μL/106 cells, or a previously titrated amount) and vortex. Incubate cells for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
Remove any unbound antibody by washing the cells in Flow Cytometry Staining Buffer. Centrifuge the suspended cells at 300 x g for 5 minutes and decant the buffer. Resuspend the cells by adding 2 mL of Flow Cytometry Staining Buffer. Repeat the wash two times.
Note: If using whole blood, samples should go through a red blood cell lysis step at this point using Flow Cytometry Human or Mouse Lysis Buffer.
Lysis of Red Blood Cells: Add 2 mL of 1X Human (Catalog # FC002) or Mouse (Catalog # FC003) Lyse Buffer to each tube, vortex, and incubate in the dark at room temperature for 10 minutes. Centrifuge and wash cells in Flow Cytometry Staining Buffer as described in step 4 above.
Note: If an unconjugated primary antibody was used, incubation with an appropriate secondary antibody should occur now. Dilute the secondary antibody in Flow Cytometry Staining Buffer, starting with the suggested concentration in the product datasheet. Incubate for 20-30 minutes in the dark and wash as in step 4.
Resuspend the cells in 200 – 400 μL of Flow Cytometry Staining Buffer for final flow cytometric analysis.
Note: For a negative control, a separate set of cells should be stained with an isotype control antibody using the steps outlined above.

Sample preparation
1. Cell Harvest:
A. Suspension cells: Count cells. 104 - 105 cells are needed for the assay.
B. Adherent cells: Scrape the cells into the existing culture media and suspend. Do not treat cells with trypsin or EDTA as these agents disrupt mycoplasma.
2. Transfer 1 mL cell suspension (104 to 105 cells) into the Sample Lysis Tubes and centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 3 minutes at 4°C.
3. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.
4. Resuspend the cell pellet with 50 ul Lysis Buffer by vortexing.

6. Heat the samples at 95°C for 10 minutes to inactivate the protease.
7. Spin down cell debris at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C. Transfer supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube. Do NOT use the tubes provided with the kit as these are needed for remaining kit assays.
8. Samples are now ready for PCR. If desired, these extracts may be stored at -80°C for up to six months.
PCR preparation

2. Prepare the reaction mixtures in PCR tubes.
3. Mix gently by pipetting the reaction mixes up and down a few times. Cap tubes and centrifuge briefly to bring fluid to the bottom of the tube.
4. Place the tubes in a thermal cycler.
5. Set the temperature and cycling parameters for PCR.
Stable Cell Lines Construction
Step 1: Transfect the cells using the desired transfection method. If the selectable marker is on a separate vector, use a 5:1 to 10:1 molar ratio of plasmid containing the gene of interest to plasmid containing the selectable marker.
Step 2: Forty-eight hours after transfection, passage the cells at several different dilutions (e.g., 1:100, 1:500) in medium containing the appropriate selection drug. For effective selection, cells should be subconfluent, because confluent, non-growing cells are resistant to the effects of antibiotics like Geneticin. Suspension cells can be selected in soft agar or in 96-well plates for single-cell cloning.For the next two weeks, replace the drug-containing medium every 3 to 4 days (or as needed).
Step 3: During the second week, monitor cells for distinct “islands” of surviving cells. Depending on the cell type, drug-resistant clones will appear in 2–5 weeks. Cell death should occur after 3–9 days in cultures transfected with the negative control plasmid.
Step 4: Isolate large (500–1,000 cells), healthy colonies using cloning cylinders or sterile toothpicks, and continue to maintain cultures in medium containing the appropriate drug (for the isolation of clones in suspension culture, see Freshney, 1993).
Step 5: Transfer single cells from resistant colonies into the wells of 96-well plates to confirm that they can yield antibiotic-resistant colonies. Ensure that only one cell is present per well after the transfer.

Suspension cell culture
1.Take 150/250 ml conical flask containing autoclaved 40/60 ml liquid medium
2. Transfer 3-4 pieces of pre-established callus tissue (approx. wt. 1 gm. each) from the culture tube using the spoon headed spat­ula to conical flasks.
3. Flame the neck of conical flask, close the mouth of the flask with a piece of allumini­um foil or a cotton plug. Cover the closure with a piece of brown paper.
4. Place the flasks within the clamps of a ro­tary shaker moving at the 80-120 rpm (rev­olution per minute)
5. After 7 days, pour the contents of each flask through the sterilized sieve pore diameter -60µ- 100µ and collect the filtrate in a big sterilized container. The filtrate contains only free cells and cell aggregates.
6. Allow the filtrate to settle for 10-15 min. or centrifuge the filtrate at 500 to 1,000 rpm and finally pour off the supernatant.
7. Re-suspend the residue cells in a requisite volume of fresh liquid medium and dispense the cell suspension equally in several ster­ilized flasks (150/250 ml). Place the flasks on shaker and allow the free cells and cell aggregates to grow.
8. At the next subculture, repeat the previous steps but take only one-fifth of the residual cells as the inoculum and dispense equally in flasks and again place them on shaker.
9. After 3-4 subcultures, transfer 10 ml of cell suspension from each flask into new flask containing 30 ml fresh liquid medium.
10. To prepare a growth curve of cells in sus­pension, transfer a definite number of cells measured accurately by a hemocytometer to a definite volume of liquid medium and incubates on shaker. Pipette out very little aliquot of cell suspension at short intervals of time (1 or 2 days interval) and count the cell number. Plot the cell count data of a passage on a graph paper and the curve will indicate the growth pattern of suspension culture.
Viral infection
Day 1: Plate 250,000--‐500,000 cells in one well of a 6--‐well plate.
Day 2: Mix 100 ul un-concentrated virus (or 2 ul concentrated virus) in a tube with 900 ul regular growth media and 1 ul polybrene (10 mg/ml stock). Vortex. Aspirate media from your cells. Replace with virus-containing media.
Day 3: If your construct contains a fluorescent reporter, check cells. Please note that it can take up to two days for cells to transduce. Depending on the confluency of your cells, remove virus-containing media, and either refresh with new media or passage your cells.

Sample prep (based on a typical cell culture scenario)
1. Place the cell culture dish in ice and wash the cells with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS).
2. Aspirate the TBS, then add ice-cold RIPA buffer (1 ml per 100 mm dish).
3. Scrape adherent cells off the dish using a cold plastic cell scrape and gently transfer the cell suspension into a precooled microcentrifuge tube.
4. Maintain constant agitation for 30 min at 4°C.
5. If necessary, sonicate 3 times for 10-15 sec to complete cell lysis and shear DNA to reduce sample viscosity.
