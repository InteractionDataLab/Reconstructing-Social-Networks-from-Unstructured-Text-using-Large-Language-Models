Why notebooks are important
In order to follow how the work progresses and how to plan for future work, it is of great importance to clearly document the work and to reflect upon recent and ancient results to see where improvements can be made. The process of evaluation of the hard work becomes a lot easier if a structured and detailed notebook is written continuously throughout the time period of which the work is being made.
During the iGEM work-intense year 2018 a lot of different  hypotheses has been tested and compared. And to keep track of all of the protocols used, a document has been written containing materials, equipments and methods.
