Overview
Here, we present our part collection. The collection consists of seven biobricks, each composed of the coding sequence of Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (vgb) placed under an Anderson promoter along with a ribosome binding site and a double terminator sequence. The Part collection functions as a small library of vgb expression systems, with the purpose of providing a standardized way of controlling the expression level of vgb. Since expression of vgb has been shown to increase cell productivity and survivability under microaerobic conditions, this gives rise to a plethora of applications. With the addition of this library, it is now possible to balance the benefits and the cost on the cell economy. This provides a modular way to specifically tailor the amount of vgb expressed for an intended application without compromising cell resources.
