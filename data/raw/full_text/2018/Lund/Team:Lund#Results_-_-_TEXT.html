Overview
In order to get good results, frequent checkpoints has to be used. It is important checking that the biobricks are correctly assembled and that they in fact contain the desired DNA. This is shown in the result section in the “BioBrick” tab. Then it’s important to see how the inserts affects the  growth rate, shown and analysed in the tab for “Growth curves”. When the growth effect is determined the real results can be obtained. These are how the GFP production is affected with different VHb concentrations, shown in the tab for “VHB & GFP production”. It is also interesting to see what happens if the systems of VHb+GFP is different on a larger scale. How the measurements went when using a bioreactor is shown in the tab for “Fermentor”.
As a side-project, connected with the human hemoglobin model, mutants of different adult human hemoglobins were evaluated which you can read more about it in the tab for “Human hemoglobin”.
