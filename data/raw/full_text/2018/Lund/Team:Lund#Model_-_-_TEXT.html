in silico design of hemoglobin mutants
Structure-property modeling of proteins is a notoriously difficult problem. In this model we rationally design human hemoglobin mutants in a semi data-driven manner by combining machine learning and protein engineering. The proteins are expressed in the lab and shown to be functional.

Growth Curves
Vitreoscilla hemoglobin has revealed itself to possess many interesting properties. Here we model the growth curves of cells expressing the hemoglobin under promoters of varying strength. We show that the additional expression of the protein is deemed positive on the growth rate.
