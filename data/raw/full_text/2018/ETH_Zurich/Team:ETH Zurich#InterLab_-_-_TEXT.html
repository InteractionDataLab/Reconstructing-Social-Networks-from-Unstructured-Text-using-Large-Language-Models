This year the fifth international iGEM InterLab study took place. The goal of this years InterLab study is to establish a reliable framework to compare fluerecence measurements from different laboratorys. To achieve this goal it is essential         to identify and correct sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology measurements. As previous InterLab studies have shown, it is possible to dramatically reduce systematic variability in GFP fluerescence measurements among         different laboratory if the intensity is measured in absolute fluorescence units and calibrated against a known concentration of fluorescent molecule. However, when it comes to bulk measurments of cells expressing a fluerescent molecule the         number of cells in the sample remains a source of considerable systematic variability. This years InterLab study aims to overcome this limitation by determining a mean expression level of GFP per cell, rather than an absolute fluorescence         measurement.
Two orthogonal approaches are applied to determine the number of cells in a sample:
Converting between absorbance of cells to absorbance of a known concentration of beads.
Counting colony-forming units (CFUs) from the sample.
The cell count is later used to normalize the measured absolute fluerescence. In the following sections we present the most important data from the InterLab study and the used protocoles. For further information please refere to the official iGEM InterLab study webpage .

Protocols
Competent Cell Production (from stock)
Introduction
Detergent is a major inhibitor of competent cell growth and transformation. Glass and plastic must be detergent free for these protocols. The easiest way to do this is to avoid washing glassware with detergent, and simply rinse it out.             Autoclaving glassware filled 3/4 with DI water is an effective way to remove most detergent residue. Media and buffers should be prepared in detergent free glassware and cultures grown up in detergent free glassware.
Materials
CCMB80 buffer
SOB
Detergent-free, sterile glassware and plasticware
Table-top OD600nm spectrophotometer
Procedure
Prechill 250mL centrifuge tubes and screw cap tubes before use.
Ethanol treat all working areas for sterility.
Inoculate 250 ml of SOB medium with 1 ml vial of seed stock and grow at 20°C to an OD600nm of 0.3. Use the "cell culture" function on the Nanodrop to determine OD value. OD value = 600nm Abs reading x 10.
This takes                 approximately 16 hours.                 Controlling the temperature makes this a more reproducible process, but is not essential.                 Room temperature will work. You can adjust this temperature somewhat to fit your schedule                 Aim for lower, not higher OD if you can't hit this mark
Fill an ice bucket halfway with ice. Use the ice to pre-chill as many flat bottom centrifuge bottles as needed.
Transfer the culture to the flat bottom centrifuge tubes. Weigh and balance the tubes using a scale . Try to get the weights as close as possible, within 1 gram.
Centrifuge at 3000g at 4°C for 10 minutes in a flat bottom centrifuge bottle.                  Flat bottom centrifuge tubes make the fragile cells much easier to resuspend
Decant supernatant into waste receptacle, bleach before pouring down the drain.
Gently resuspend in 80 ml of ice cold CCMB80 buffer
Pro tip: add 40ml first to resuspend the cells. When cells are in suspension, add another 40ml CCMB80 buffer for a total of 80ml                 Pipet buffer against the wall of the centrifuge bottle to resuspend cells. Do not pipet directly into cell pellet!                 After pipetting, there will still be some residual cells stuck to the bottom. Swirl the bottles gently to resuspend these remaining cells
Incubate on ice for 20 minutes
Centrifuge again at 3000G at 4°C. Decant supernatant into waste receptacle, and bleach before pouring down the drain.
Resuspend cell pellet in 10 ml of ice cold CCMB80 buffer. If using multiple flat bottom centrifuge bottles, combine the cells post-resuspension
Use Nanodrop to measure OD of a mixture of 200 μl SOC and 50 μl of the resuspended cells .                 Use a mixture of 200 μl SOC and 50 μl CCMB80 buffer as the blank
Add chilled CCMB80 to yield a final OD of 1.0-1.5 in this test.
Incubate on ice for 20 minutes. Prepare for aliquoting .
Make labels for aliquots. Use these to label storage microcentrifuge tubes/microtiter plates                 Prepare dry ice in a separate ice bucket. Pre-chill tubes/plates on dry ice.
Aliquot into chilled 2ml microcentrifuge tubes or 50 μl into chilled microtiter plates
Store at -80°C indefinitely.Flash freezing does not appear to be necessary
Perform test transformations to calculate your competent cell efficiency .
Thawing and refreezing partially used cell aliquots dramatically reduces transformation efficiency by about 3x the first time, and about 6x total after several freeze/thaw cycles.                 Good cells should yield around 100 - 400 colonies                 Transformation efficiency is (dilution factor=15) x colony count x 105/µgDNA                 We expect that the transformation efficiency should be between 1.5x108 and 6x108cfu/µgDNA

Competent Cell Test Kit
Introduction
Before using your competent cells in an experiment, use the Competent Cell Test Kit to test the efficiency of your competent cells!             The kit includes two vials of dried-down purified plasmid DNA from BBa_J04450 (RFP construct) in plasmid backbone pSB1C3. When resuspended with 50uL dH2O, the vials will result in different concentrations: 100 pg/µL, 10 pg/µL. Perform             transformations with each of these to determine how efficient your competent cells are.             It is important to have efficient competent cells because transformations performed with ligation products usually do not yield as many colonies due to the low DNA concentration in the ligation mixture. This means that you may see             different results doing this test than you will at the end of the 3A Assembly protocol, or any other ligation.             You can use the following suggested protocol for heat-shock transformation to test your chemically-competent E. coli cells.

70% ethanol
Paper towels
Lab marker / Sharpie
1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
Container for ice
Ice
Competent cell aliquot(s)
Competent Cell Test Kit
Agar plates with chloramphenicol
42°C Waterbath (or hot water source and thermometer)
37°C Incubators (oven and shaker)
SOC media
Sterile glass beads or sterile cell spreader
Pipettor
Pipette tips
Procedure
Clean your working area by wiping down with 70% ethanol.
Thaw competent cells on ice. Label one 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for each transformation and then pre-chill by plcaacing the tubes on ice. Do triplicates (3 each) of each concentration if possible, so you can calculate an                 average colony yield.
Spin down the DNA tubes from the Competent Cell Test Kit/Transformation Efficiency Kit to collect all of the DNA into the bottom of each tube prior to use. A quick spin of 20-30 seconds at 8,000-10,000 rpm will be sufficient. Note:                 You should resuspend the DNA in each tube with 50 µL dH2O.
Pipet 1 µL of DNA into each microcentrifuge tube.
Pipet 50 µL of competent cells into each tube. Flick the tube gently with your finger to mix.
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes. Pre-heat waterbath now to 42°C. Otherwise, hot water and an accurate thermometer works, too!
Heat-shock the cells by placing into the waterbath for 45 seconds (no longer than 1 min). Be careful to keep the lids of the tubes above the water level, and keep the ice close by.
Immediately transfer the tubes back to ice, and incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
Add 950 µL of SOC media per tube, and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour shaking at 200-300rpm. Prepare the agar plates during this time: label them, and add sterile glass beads if using beads to spread the mixture.
Pipet 100 µL from each tube onto the appropriate plate, and spread the mixture evenly across the plate. Incubate at 37°C overnight or approximately 16 hours. Position the plates with the agar side at the top, and the lid at the                 bottom.
Count the number of colonies on a light field or a dark background, such as a lab bench. Use the following equation to calculate your competent cell efficiency. If you've done triplicates of each sample, use the average cell colony                 count in the calculation. Efficiency (in cfu/µg) = [colonies on plate (cfu) / Amount of DNA plated (ng)] x 1000 (ng/µg). Note: The measurement "Amount of DNA plated" refers to how much DNA was plated onto each agar plate, not the                 total amount of DNA used per transformation. You can calculate this number using the following equation: Amount of DNA plated (ng) = Volume DNA added (1 µL) x concentration of DNA (refer to vial, convert to ng/µL) x [volume plated                 (100 µL) / total reaction volume (1000 µL)]
Results
Competent cells should have an efficiency of 1.5x10^8 to 6x10^8 cfu/µg DNA, where "cfu" means "colony-forming unit" and is a measurement of cells.

IMPORTANT! ​Re-Mix (Pipette up and down) each row of your plate immediately
before putting in the plate reader! (This is important because the beads begin to settle to
the bottom of the wells within about 10 minutes, which will affect the measurements.) Take
care to mix gently and avoid creating bubbles on the surface of the liquid.
