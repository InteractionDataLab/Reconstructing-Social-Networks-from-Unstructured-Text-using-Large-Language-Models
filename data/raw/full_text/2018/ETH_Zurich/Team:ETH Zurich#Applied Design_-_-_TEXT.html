From the beginning of our project we had the vision of not only accelerating biosensing but also showcasing their potential in a real-world scenario.
Teaser Video
Rotation of a single E Coli in a cropped view
On the biological side, our main goal was to accelerate the output generation of common biosensors. For this, we exploited the natural chemotactic response of E. coli and developed a microfluidic setup which allows us to image the change in rotation of the bacteriaâ€™s flagellum. Learn more about the biological background of our approach here .
Brightfield Microscope Setup
To read out the improved biosensors, single-cell imaging is required. We designed and assembled a brightfield microscope which allows the imaging of our engineered bacteria on the robot. To facilitate the detection of bacterial response, we further developed a software that can detect rotating bacteria and read out their response. Learn more about the Hardware and the Software .
Finally, you can see here how all parts work together
