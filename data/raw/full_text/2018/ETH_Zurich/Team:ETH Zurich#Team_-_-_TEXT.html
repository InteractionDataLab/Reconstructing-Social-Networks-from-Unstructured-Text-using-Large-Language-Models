Laboratory
We spend our days (and nights) in our laborary located at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering ETH (DBSSE) . The DBSSE belongs to the ETH Basel site which is in         close proximity to the pharmaceutical industry located at the heart of Basel. Have a look at our slideshow to get an impression of our daily routine and the city of Basel.
