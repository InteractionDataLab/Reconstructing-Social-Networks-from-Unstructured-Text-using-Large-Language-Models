Mass Transfer of volatile Molecules
In perfect analogy with the human sense of smell, the first step in AROMA’s pipeline is inhaling air through a sampling conduct (i.e. “nose”). Air is bubble into a small reservoir of liquid medium, where the airborne organic molecules are           transferred into the liquid for a short period of time. This liquid sample containing the volatile compound of interest is circulated through the robot by means of an array of syringe pumps, reaching the microfluidic chip where the           biosensor is waiting. In AROMA, the sensing is carried out by engineered bacteria that are capable of generating a signal in response to the molecule we want to “smell”. To prove the viability of the sampling system, we modeled the           volatile molecule diffusion through air as well as the mass transfer from air to water, and tested the bubbling system in our lab.

Fast Biosensing
The Tar receptor is utilized in two separate approaches for a fast biosensor. To guarantee the desired time scale of seconds to only a few minutes, the underlying pathways solely rely on             post-translational processes like phosphorylation or protein-protein interaction. Furthermore, the output was designed to be fast and easily processable.
Approach A: Chemotaxis
The first approach focuses on the natural pathway of the Tar receptor; the bacterial chemotaxis. The Tar receptor transduces an input signal through an intracellular phosphorylation pathway, which directly influences the flagellum               –               the               bacterial swimming device. The flagellum can be in two different rotational states: counter-clockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) spinning. A CCW rotation of the flagellum lets the bacterium swim forward, while a CW rotation makes it               tumble, i.e. changing its direction. A signal from the Tar receptor about ligand concentration changes affects the rotational state of the flagellum.               We apply this mechanism as a biosensor by tethering the bacteria specifically at their flagellum to a glass surface. For this, we coat the surface with an antibody specific for the flagellar protein. This leads to rotation of the               bacterium around its own body, which directly corresponds to the flagellar rotation. This allows us to read out the response of the bacterium to different ligand concentrations by light microscopy followed by single-cell image               analysis.               All of this is done inside a microfluidic chip to guarantee spatial confinement and simple operability in terms of exchanging the medium.
Approach B: Split-protein complementation
This alternative strategy takes advantage of a previously engineered chimeric version of the Tar receptor, in which the cytoplasmatic domain of the membrane protein has been replaced with the signaling domain of EnvZ, an osmolarity               sensing               protein. This means that in the presence of aspartate the Tar-EnvZ chemeric receptor activates transcription of osmoregulatory genes, mediated by the binding of the OmpR transcription factor to a specific DNA sequence.               We can sense the translocation of OmpR to its target DNA sequence by using split protein complementation, a technique in which a reporter protein is divided in two non-functional parts that when brought close together reconstitute               the               original activity of the reporter, generating a detectable signal. The subparts are typically fused to two biomolecules of interest in order to study their co-localization.               In order to take advantage of split protein complementation, we fused OmpR to the N-terminal part of firefly luciferase, and TetR to the C-terminal part. TetR is another transcriptional regulator that binds its target DNA sequence               very               strongly. By putting the receptor sequences for OmpR and TetR next to each other, we can force the re-assembly of luciferase and detect its light emission using a microscope, which we correlate to ligand concentration.
