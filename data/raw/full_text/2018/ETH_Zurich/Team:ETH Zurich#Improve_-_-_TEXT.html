★ ALERT!         This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the medal criterion or award listed below.          Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal criterion and/or award. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards.          Improve         For teams seeking to improve upon a previous part or project, you should document all of your work on this page. Please remember to include all part measurement and characterization data on the part page on the Registry. Please include a         link to your improved part on this page.          Gold Medal Criterion #2         Standard Tracks: Create a new part that has a functional improvement upon an existing BioBrick part. The sequences of the new and existing parts must be different. You must perform experiments with both parts to demonstrate this improvement.         Document the experimental characterization on the Part's Main Page on the Registry for both the existing and new parts. Both the new and existing Main Page of each Part’s Registry entry must reference each other. Submit a sample of the new         part to the Registry. The existing part must NOT be from your 2018 part number range and must be different from the part documented in bronze #4.          Special Tracks: Improve the function of an existing iGEM project (that your current team did not originally create) and display your achievement on your wiki.

Competent Cell Production (from stock)
Introduction
Detergent is a major inhibitor of competent cell growth and transformation. Glass and plastic must be detergent free for these protocols. The easiest way to do this is to avoid washing glassware with detergent, and simply rinse it             out. Autoclaving glassware filled 3/4 with DI water is an effective way to remove most detergent residue. Media and buffers should be prepared in detergent free glassware and cultures grown up in detergent free glassware.
Materials
CCMB80 buffer
SOB
Detergent-free, sterile glassware and plasticware
Table-top OD600nm spectrophotometer
Procedure
Prechill 250mL centrifuge tubes and screw cap tubes before use.
