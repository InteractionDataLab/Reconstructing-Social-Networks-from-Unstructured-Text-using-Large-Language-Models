Protocoles
Competent Cell Production (from stock)
Introduction
Detergent is a major inhibitor of competent cell growth and transformation. Glass and plastic must be detergent free for these protocols. The easiest way to do this is to avoid washing glassware with detergent, and simply rinse it             out. Autoclaving glassware filled 3/4 with DI water is an effective way to remove most detergent residue. Media and buffers should be prepared in detergent free glassware and cultures grown up in detergent free glassware.
Materials
CCMB80 buffer
SOB
Detergent-free, sterile glassware and plasticware
Table-top OD600nm spectrophotometer
Procedure
Prechill 250mL centrifuge tubes and screw cap tubes before use.
