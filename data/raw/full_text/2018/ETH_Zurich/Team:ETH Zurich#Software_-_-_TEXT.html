In this section we provide all of the software tools that were created during the project. As our biosensor generates a visual output, one of the main challenges was to create algorithms that could read out and analyse the imaging data. Apart from developing image         analysis software, also all of our hardware parts needed to be interfaced in a reasonable way. We decided to implement the software interface in ROS, which is one of the most popular robotics framework. Therefore, with our software tools,         the biological sensor as well as all the needed components (camera, syringes, bubbling device, path planning algorithm, etc.) can be easily integrated into a robotics platform. All of the code can be also found on our GitHub repository
Overview
Motility Readout
For our Motility approach we developed an advanced image analysis software which detects the spinning bacteria and reads out their rotation. From this data we can reconstruct the concentration of the molecule in our solution.

Luminescence Algorithm
The goal of our luminescence readout algorithm is to detect very low levels of light intensity. This algorithm is the foundation for the readout of the luminescence signal corresponding to Approach B.

Robot             Controls
All of our DIY hardware components have to be interfaced in an elegant way in order to unfold their potential. On this page we give a brief introduction on the ROS interface for all of our the components and how they can interact with each other.

Path Planning
The path planning algorithm determines AROMAâ€™s path through the field. Therefore, it is a crucial algorithm as it has to ensure that the source is found as quickly and efficiently as possible.
