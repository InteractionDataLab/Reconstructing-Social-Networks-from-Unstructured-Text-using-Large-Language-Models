Diffusion Model
Describes the diffusion of molecules of interest in the air, informing us about the distance at which the presence of a molecule source can be detected.

Motility Model
Models the chemotactic response of the bacteria to the molecule of interest. It informed us about what range of concentrations can be sensed.

Integrated Models
Combining all models, we could generate synthetic measurement data that we use for in-silico testing and improvement of the path planning algorithm.

Bubbeling Model
Captures the solution of the analytes in the medium. We use this model to determine the concentration of our dissolved molecule in the medium.

Holographic Imaging Model
Optical modeling of our original lensless microscope setup revealed its unfeasibility with commercial sensors, leading us to include magnification lenses.

Split Protein
Protein - DNA docking guided the set-up of our screening system. Moreover, modeling the kinetics of split luciferase revealed that the concentration of Tar-EnvZ is the most critical parameter, therefore we decided to place it under an inducible promoter for easy tuning.

Diffusion in medium
By modeling the diffusion of the analyte in agar we were able to predict the plating time such that the concentration gradient is optimal for library screening.
