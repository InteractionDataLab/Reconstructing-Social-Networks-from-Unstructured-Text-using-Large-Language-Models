Marburg - Unesp - Utrecht
Scroll
We participated in several collaborations with teams from Europe and South America. The iGEM team from Marburg carried out an InterLab study with Vibrio           natriegens to show the potential of this organism to increase the speed at which new findings in synthetic biology can be generated. Another collaboration we had was with the Unesp Brazil team. Thanks to our experience with modeling we were happy to help them improve on their own modelling part. Finally, we had a collaboration with the iGEM team from Utrecht . They engineered the Tar receptor to establish different sensing thresholds. The intellectual exchange helped us to improve on our own project.
Marburg InterLab Study
We not only participated in the official fifth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology, which is carried out by the iGEM competition itself but also in the InterLab study from this year’s Marburg iGEM team.       They are working with Vibrio natriegens as a possible new chassis for synthetic biology. In their project „Vibrigens - Accelerating Synbio“ they aim to establish Vibrio natriegens, the fastest-growing organism known to date (doubling time ~ 10 min) as the new go-to organism for everyday lab work in both academic and industrial applications. The task in their InterLab study was similar to the official iGEM InterLab study, i.e.       to measure fluorescence of different test devices at different time points.

Protocols
Preparation of electrocompetent cells
Introduction
This protocol was provided by the Marburg iGEM team to perform their InterLab study.
Materials
LB media + v2 salts (204 mM NaCl, 4.2 mM KCl, 23.14mM MgCl2)
Electroporation buffer (680 mM sucrose, 7 mM K2HPO4, pH = 7) (sterile filtrated)
Overnight culture of Vibrio natriegens inoculated from plates or cryostock in LB + v2 salts (e.g. 5mL, 37 °C; at 200 r.p.m) ( 10mL Falcon from the box )
Pre-chill the electroporation buffer (approx. 500 mL) and the centrifugation tubes you want to use (on ice)
On the following day, 500 mL of the LB + v2 is inoculated with the overnight culture with a final OD of 0.05
The culture is grown at 37 °C in a baffled flask with shaking at 200 r.p.m. until an OD600 of 0.5
Procedure
Divide the culture into two (or more) pre-chilled centrifugation containments
Put the culture on ice for 15 min
The cells are pelleted at 3000x g. for 20 min at 4 °C to avoid cell damage
The supernatant is carefully decanted and the cell pellets of both containers are gently resuspended in 10 mL of chilled electroporation buffer
The suspensions are transferred to two chilled 50 mL Falcons
The tubes are each filled to top with additional chilled electroporation buffer
(max. 50 mL in total or fill to maximum volume in accordance with manufactures instruction)
The Falcon tubes are inverted several times
The cells are centrifuged down at 3000x g for 15 min at 4 °C
The washing step (resuspend, fill-up, invert, centrifuge, discard supernatant) is repeated two times for a total of three washes• After the final wash, the supernatant is carefully decanted and the cells are gently resuspended in                   residual electroporation buffer (equals approximately 500 µL)
Measure the OD in a 1:20 dilution against electroporation buffer (e.g. 950 µL buffer & 50 µL sample)
The volume is adjusted with additional electroporation buffer to bring the final OD600 to 16
Cells are aliquoted (80 µL) into chilled tubes, frozen in liquid Nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use
Evaluation
Competent cells were used for electroporation at 0.9 kV to successfully transform cells.
Results
20 aliquots were stored at -80°C in the freezer (room 3.80)
Electroporation
Introduction
This protocol was provided by the Marburg iGEM team to perform their InterLab study with Vibrigens.
Materials
Recovery media 10 aliquots (a’ 500µL )(BHI + v2 salts (204 mM NaCl, 4.2 mM KCl, 23.14mM MgCl2), and 680 mM sucrose)
Preheat the aliquots with the recovery medium to 45 °C ( pipetting mixing with cold cells and resuspending in chilled cuvettes will cool down the media )
Agar plates (LB + v2 + 1% agarose + 2 µg/ml chloramphenicol (Cm))
Procedure
Take nine aliquots of the prepared competent cells and place them on ice.
1µL of the Plasmid DNA (100 ng/µL) and the electrocompetent cells are combined and gently mixed (NO VORTEX, avoid foaming) in a chilled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
(each aliquot gets one 1 µL of another plasmid from the box one aliquot is a control and will later not be plated out on a plate with antibiotics)
The cell-DNA suspension is transferred to a chilled electroporation cuvette with a 0.1 cm gap size
Cells are electroporated with the following settings: 900 V, 25 mF, 200 Ω (Eppendorf electroporator)
Cells are immediately recovered in 500 μL (one aliquot) preheated (45°C) recovery medium and transferred to a 1.5 mL tube
The cells are recovered by incubating at 37 °C for 1.5 h. (also put the agar plates for preheating in the incubator at 37 °C)
The cells are centrifuged down at 3000x g, most of the supernatant is removed
The pellet is resuspended in the leftover media (approx. 50 µL) and plated out on warm agar plates (37 °C) containing the appropriate antibiotic (2 µg/ml Chloramphenicol - Cm)
The plates are incubated for several hours or overnight at 37 °C for colonies to appear. Check the rest of the InterLab Protocol to keep track of colony growth
Evaluation
Electroporation with all test devices worked and yielded colonies
Results
Transformation with test devices was successful.
Cell measurement
Introduction
This protocol was provided by the Marburg iGEM team to perform their InterLab study with Vibrigens. Deviations from the original protocol are highlighted.
Materials
LB media + v2 salts (204 mM NaCl, 4.2 mM KCl, 23.14mM MgCl2)
Plate reader
Procedure
Pick two colonies from each of the transformation plates and inoculate in 5 mL LB + v2 + 2 µg/mL Chloramphenicol. Grow the cells overnight (16-18 hours) at 37 °C and 220 r.p.m. 10mL cultures were first                     grown                     24h at RT and subsequently for another 1h at 37°C
Make a 1:20 dilution of each overnight culture in 0.25 mL of culture into 4.75 mL of LB + v2 + 2 μg/mL Chloramphenicol
Measure Abs600 of 200 µL of these diluted cultures and with a blank in a 96-well plate (samples should be laid out according to the plate diagram below)
Record the data in your notebook
Dilute the cultures further to a target Abs600 of 0.02 in a final volume of 12 mL LB + v2 + 2μg/mL Chloramphenicol in 50 mL Falcon tube (amber, or covered with foil to block light)
Take 500 μL samples of the diluted cultures at 0 hours into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, prior to incubation. (At each time point 0 hours and 3 hours, you will take a sample from each of the 8 devices, two colonies per device, for a                   total of 16 Eppendorf tubes with 500 μL samples per time point, 32 samples total). Place the samples on ice
Incubate the remainder of the cultures at 37 °C and 220 r.p.m for 3 hours
Take 500 μL samples of the cultures at 3 hours of incubation into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. Place the samples on ice
At the end of sampling point you need to measure your samples (Abs600 and fluorescence measurement). Exitation wavelength: 485nm (Bandwidth 20nm), Emission wavelength: 535nm Bandwidth(20nm).
Record data in your notebook
Evaluation
Colony 2 of the negative device did not grow, therefore no data is available for these replicates! Further evaluation is performed by the Marburg InterLab team. The data was sent to the Marburg iGEM               team is presented in the tables 2-4.
Results
Results are published by the Marburg iGEM team. Please refere to their webpage.
Unesp Brazil
The iGEM team Unesp Brazil works on a new framework to engineer and test probiotics. To analyze their circuit, they use modelling. A major concern was the production of insulin in the absence of glucose. We helped them to improve their model       and supported them throughout the develpment of their model. Our contribution in particular:
We helped to improve their ODE model by adding additional equations and restrictions to their model. Compare Figure 1 and Figure 2 to see how this influenced their model output. As you can see we were able to adjust their model so that it           predicts           reasonable concentrations. In Figure 1.2 the KD for sRNA/DNA binding is depcited and shows how important it is to optimize this paramter for their model in order to obtain the desired output.
We developed guidlines for the team to guide thier parameter estimation and helped them with the literature research for the parametres of their models.
The Unesp Brazil team is working on a booklet on modelling for further iGEM teams at their university. This booklet is meant to guide subsequent teams on their modelling approaches. We were happy to contribute by providing the Tips & Tricks section in this booklet.
We provided lecture material for stochastic modelling.

Utrecht
This year, the iGEM team from Utrecht is also working on modifying and improving the Tar receptor of E. coli. In their project they are evolving the natural receptor so that it can reliably detect pollutants in water. Furthermore, they are         planning to modify the receptor to increase the range of detectable molecules, making it more applicable in real life.          During the European iGEM Meetup in July, we realized that both of our teams were working on chemotaxis-based biosensors. Although our projects are based on somewhat different methods and applications, we did struggle with similar         complications at the time. Therefore, we decided to stay in touch and update each other about problems and solutions, which formed the base for our collaboration. An example of our similar approaches was found in the way both our         teams dealt with our intended use of split luciferase. Both our projects included using the reconstitution of a split luciferase to create a read-out signal from the chemotaxis pathway. Especially when searching for the right luciferase for our         application, we were happy to split tasks. We shared outcomes with each other, which led to our current solution using firefly luciferase.         In the future, we also aim to integrate the engineered bacteria from the Utrecht iGEM team on AROMA. We hope their biosensor will improve the range of detectable concentrations, while also broadening the range of substrates that could         potentially be sensed.
