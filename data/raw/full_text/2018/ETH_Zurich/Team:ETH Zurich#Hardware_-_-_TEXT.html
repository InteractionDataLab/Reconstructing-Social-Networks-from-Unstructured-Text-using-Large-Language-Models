Microscope
At the core of our biosensors is the connection between biology and electronics. Our imaging hardware bridges that gap. We built a brightfield microscope, which is able to image E. coli on a single-cell level. Additionally we looked into lensless microscopy and created a luminescence readout device.

Mechanics
Our robot AROMA is built and designed completeley from scratch. It is a mobile platform which is able to explore uneven terrain and houses a miniaturised lab on top of it. It can serve as a research platform for future projects at the interface between biology and robotics.

Syringe Pump
The syringe pumps are a crucial component for our system as they enable us to preciseley control the flow of the liquids on our robot. Apart from our use in the field they can also serve as a precise, reliable and low cost alternative when equipping a lab.

Microfluidic Chip
Our custom designed and in-house fabricated microfluidic chip enables us to reliably image the response of E. coli. Furthermore the microfluidic system allows a precise spatial confinement of the bacteria.

Bubbling
Our bubbling hardware enables us to transfer the target molecule from the air into the medium. We designed a custom bubbling chamber to implement this in an efficient way.
