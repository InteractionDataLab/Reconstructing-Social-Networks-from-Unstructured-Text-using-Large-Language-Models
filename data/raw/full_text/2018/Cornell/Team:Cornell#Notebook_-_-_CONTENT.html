                        P&amp;P led the general body meeting on September 15th to conduct Application Day as a team exercise to brainstorm possible applications of our project in various industries. We compiled all of the responses and narrowed the scope to five main areas: co-culturing, process control, biological clocks, medical devices, and cell therapy. We had two additional ideas that we thought were interesting but had a bit of difficulty conceptualizing: biological data storage and microfluidics.
