Oscillate aims to break through existing biotechnologies through our foundational advance in frequency rather than amplitude sensitive biological systems. Our multifaceted approach to tackling this project spanned research, interacting with experts, and exploring applications. We started with the basics and went to the foundations of synthetic biology. We spoke with professors in fields ranging from electrical and computer engineering to biomedical engineering and gauged the feasibility of our ideas. We listened to their feedback and ideas and incorporated them into our wet lab practices and modeling. After implementing their considerations into our design, we also tested our project with expert feedback and advice in mind. Finally, we went to various fields to discuss the applications and implications of our project, doing all this while considering the ethical and entrepreneurial implications of our project.

To address this concern, we would introduce the ferritin nanoparticles into the cells of frequency-sensitive bacteria. When we wish to have the ferritin nanoparticles carry out a specific task in the body, we would then use ultrasounds to heat up the bacteria to particular frequencies for selective expression. Though Professor March suggested applying this idea in environments with temperature fluctuations and gave us the aforementioned application ideas, he also challenged us to find our own comprehensive application for our project, as our work should not simply exist in a vacuum.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="practices-exploration-section-left"><DIV class="practices-exploration-text-left"><P>When we interviewed Professor Varner, he introduced the prospect of cell-free synthesis, the formation of cellular products without the actual cells. In essence, we would take the cellular machinery involved in the production of, for example, proteins, and mix them together in a beaker with the frequency-sensitive bacteria. We would then add plasmids to the solution as an alternative to traditional cellular DNA and produce the desired reporters. The process would be modulated by the specific frequencies aimed toward the beaker solution. When the bacteria in the beaker pick up on the appropriate frequency, the desired products would be produced until the frequency is removed. During our discussion with Professor Varner, he mentioned the possibility implementing our biocircuit for cell-free synthesis implants for in vivo therapeutic production of proteins. In these, we could non-invasive control protein expression levels, allowing adaptability to dynamic patient needs. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="practices-recognition-wrapper"><DIV class="standard-page-content-title">Group Brainstorming</DIV><DIV class="practices-recognition"><P>In addition to the feedback from the professors, our Policy &amp; Practices sub-team held a large brainstorming session on September 15th during our weekly team-wide meeting where we opened the floor to our team members to collect a wide array of ideas for possible applications of our project. We received a huge range of suggestions from food storage to applications in space. Each idea had potential, as well as their respective advantages and drawbacks, so it was difficult for us to settle on one single idea. However, we were eventually able to narrow our results down to five main categories: co-culturing, process control, biological clocks, medical devices, and cell therapy, three of which are discussed below. For each of our main ideas, we examined the specifics of the issue, as well as current solutions, if any, before identifying our approach and the industries in which they might be applicable.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="practices-exploration-wrapper"><DIV class="practices-exploration-section-left"><DIV class="practices-exploration-text-left"><DIV class="practices-page-content-subheading" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
                                    Application 1: Co-Culturing
                                </DIV><P>For our first idea, we looked at the subject of co-culturing. Co-culturing happens when a a cell culture is set up with two or more different populations of cells growing with some degree of contact [4]. While this may be easy to set up, it is very difficult to maintain. The conditions of the culture have to be just right to support all the populations. They will compete for resources, but one population can not be allowed to overtake the others. One of the major reasons for setting up a co-culture is data acquisition, but even this needs to be carefully planned [4]. The dynamics of each individual population, as well as the interactions and the media, need to be studied in detail. Simple assays don’t exist for co-cultures. These problems of population maintenance, data collection, and culture conditions currently don’t have all-encompassing solutions [4]. Any more than two populations in a co-culture is too complex to maintain.</P><P>Oscillate could be part of the solution by introducing control over each population in the co-culture. Using different degradation tags and responsive promoters, it would be possible to tune the frequency at which Oscillate functions. Each population could respond to a different orthogonal frequency, which would then allow us to regulate each population’s growth. This means that one population could never overtake another, as the right frequency simply needs to be emitted to get the other population to grow faster. While Oscillate might not solve the issues with data collection, it would allow for co-culturing to become a more viable option.</P><P>This development could have significant implications for the microbiome and for biomanufacturing. The microbiome is a natural co-culture inside the human body. Many companies now advertise that they increase the population of “good” bacteria in the microbiome, but if each population were controlled with a different frequency, then the optimal ratio of populations could be maintained per person [6]. On the other hand, biomanufacturing utilizes multiple bioreactors to support biologically active systems, such as cultures [2]. Each bioreactor typically has one population where the product from one reactor is fed into another until the final product is created [2]. With Oscillate, there would be no need for multiple bioreactors since there would be the possibility of collapsing multiple bioreactors into one co-culture reactor. The product from one population feeds the next within the same reactor until the final product is produced.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="practices-exploration-section-right"><DIV class="practices-exploration-text-right"><DIV class="practices-page-content-subheading" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
                                    Application 2: Biological Clocks
                                </DIV><P>We also considered the idea of biological clocks. Biological clocks are innate mechanisms that control the cyclic activities of an organism [1]. One commonly discussed example of a biological clock is circadian rhythm, which is the 24-hour cycle of physiological processes in an organism. The main issue that arises with biological clocks is that when they become irregular, processes that should occur on a cycle are disrupted [1]. This negatively affects sleep cycles, digestion, body temperature, and other important functions that could lead to diseases such as diabetes, depression, and sleep disorders. The current solution is to treat the resulting symptoms with medication rather than the underlying causes. Medications are developed to help with sleep, to regulate insulin, or to produce antidepressant hormones. However, they never address the root cause: irregular biological clocks.</P><P>Using Oscillate, cells could sense when a cycle is irregular via frequency sensing and then respond accordingly. This would adjust the clock itself instead of simply treating the symptoms, thus reducing the need for additional medication and the risk of several disorders. One of the biggest impacts this could have is on sleep. Many people struggle with a regular sleep cycle, which could result in a lot of other problems [3]. With Oscillate, the hormones that promote sleep could be produced on a regular cycle and get people the sleep they need.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="practices-exploration-section-left"><DIV class="practices-exploration-text-left"><DIV class="practices-page-content-subheading" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
                                    Application 3: Cell Therapy
                                </DIV><P>Finally, the last topic we explored was cell therapy. Cell therapies use therapeutics at a cellular level in order to treat diseases [5]. Relevant uses today include stem cell therapy, cancer targeting, and hormonal therapy. Although there have been promising results with these therapies, there are also many issues, ranging from insufficient response to rejection to insufficient means of control [5]. Instead, simple dose-dependent administered drugs and other medicines are currently still being developed to combat these diseases.</P><P>Using Oscillate, frequency could be used to control the cells involved in these therapies. The frequency would penetrate the human tissue and offer more precise control over the therapies, such as where the cells are going and when they get activated. This could be extremely relevant in oncology, where T-cells have been modified to attack cancer but also end up attacking the healthy cells in the body. This would also be relevant in hormonal responses, where the cells would be able to sense the natural frequency of the hormones and then respond accordingly.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="practices-recognition-wrapper"><DIV class="standard-page-content-title">Final Thoughts</DIV><DIV class="practices-recognition"><P>Oscillate has many potential uses in many fields, ranging from medicine to microbiology to manufacturing. Our interviews with Professor Lambert, Professor March, Dr. Baig, and Professor Varner informed our initial ideas and inspired our creativity during brainstorming. Their expertise provided us with the ideal launch point for delving deeper into our project’s potential, and we found that the possibilities are endless.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="practices-implementation-wrapper"><DIV class="standard-page-content-title">Works Cited</DIV><OL><LI> Apte, C.
