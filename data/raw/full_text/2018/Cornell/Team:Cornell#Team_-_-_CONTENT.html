                    Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, Rahul Rambhatla. A truly mythological being in all sense of the word. His ability to solve the hardest ChemE problem sets only rivals his ability to resist the temptation of meat. Some might question why a chemical engineer leads a synthetic biology project team, Rahul is one of those people. He is not immune to the difficulties of this world however, on late nights you may find him swiping aimlessly on Tinder, but he carries a far bigger weight than most, the looming presence of arranged marriage. On most days you can find him in Weill or Duffield, and on truly (un)lucky days you may see him sporting one of his polos or t-shirts, with his dad bod on full display. Ride on Rahul, ride on.

                    Amith Punyala (2018)
                    Pretty much any old Joe Schmoe can count cells under a microscope or click buttons on one of those new-fangled electronic plate readers.  But for what we in the trade know as “wetwork” … you need a professional.  A professional like Amith Punyala.
                    After a long and distinguished career liquidating LB stock and spilling brain heart infusion, Amith retired to live a life in peace on his quaint plantation in Georgia, accompanied by his best friends—an exotic tame moth collection.  But just when Punyala thought he was out, he was pulled back in.  They stole his pipette tips and resold them on the black market.  They stored his plates upside down.  Worst of all, they destroyed his vintage -20 freezer.  This time, it’s no longer just another job.  It’s personal.
                    This autumn, Amith Punyala is out for vengeance, raising his Eppendorf one final time.  Watch in your local IMAX® theatre or convention center starting October 24.

If you ever need to find him, 99.99% chance he is in Uris library, sipping cocktails in the cocktail lounge. Be careful not to give him too much because he might just fall asleep on you. However, you must know that his drink of choice is tea. Although he doesn't have it often, when he does, he brews really big pots of tea.

                    Behram bʌ-räm bae-räm
                    1.        Dude who can and will pull off any outfit be it a bucket hat, Jean jacket or light up shoes it will look good on him. Oh and don’t forget the classy penny board.
                    2.        Somebody who knows everything about cars, literally everything. You mention a season of Top Gear and he can tell you every car in every episode, including the bad ones.
                    3.        A caretaker of fish, who will care for them, scrub them and when it comes time, bury them properly.
                    His imagination is endless, his heart his huge so if you ever need some tips or want to bounce wacky ideas off somebody, or just want a wholesome conversation, just mention Jeff Buckley’s hair (which you should always be doing anyway) and Behram will show up to help.

                    When you meet Matthew, the first thing you notice is his glorious beard. The second thing you notice is his definition. My Buddha, that man is so defined that he puts the dictionary to shame. His arms are just soooo.. *cough*...right, this is a bio about matt. So Matt likes to go to the gym, he works out pretty often. Whenever he does, he just looks so hot in that tight outfit. I often just love watching him squat because of that well defined A-...*cough*. Sorry, bad habits die hard.

                    Jackie Zheng, a sophomore CS major, is a man of many talents and mysteries. His presence will leave you asking questions like: What is going on with that flowing mane? Why did he just randomly start doing push ups? How did he just make a perfect steak at midnight sporting nothing but briefs, with only a pair of chopsticks and some salt? Undoubtably questionable, Jackie has made great contributions to the team, most noticably through his ability to physically intimidate cells to do what we want by simply flexing over a petri dish. Though he has great technical ability, Jackie still puts the sexy in burning bread because somehow microwaving it was going to fix it. Wait.

                    This is the story of a woman named Jennifer. Jennifer worked for a company in a big building where she was Employee #7513. Employee #7513’s job was simple: she sat at her desk in room 7513 and she pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to her through a monitor on her desk, telling her what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what Employee #7513 did every day of every month of every year, and although others might have considered it soul rending, Jennifer relished every moment the orders came in, as though she had been made exactly for this job. And Jennifer was happy. Jennifer is a CS major.

There's this rumor that she runs multiple marathons a year and has a start-up for therapeutic devices... that she knows something about just about everything... that she is a writer, aspiring doctor, and designer... that shes currently traveling the world...But once you get to know her, you realize all of it is quite true, and that she is a kind and enthusiastic human being to boot!

                    If you didn’t think a room could get any brighter, just wait until Rachel steps foot in it. One of the cutest rays of sunshine you’ll ever find on Cornell’s campus, Rachel is as fun and cheerful as the sprinkles she loves to eat. Rachel is fearless because she WILL. DRINK. THAT. BOBA. (and immediately take a Lactaid because ain’t nobody got time for lactose intolerance). You’ll never catch her setting foot in Carpenter Hall unless the world is coming to an end (and even then it’s still debatable). When she’s not busy being a star BME student, Rachel can be found actively petting dogs and speed-walking to her classes.

                    Warning: This bio may be too wholesome for some. But that's because Aaron is the most wholesome human being you'll ever meet. When's he's not engineering biologically, doing experiments in the dungeons of Weill, and chucking gnarly tosses on the ultimate frisbee team, you can find him hanging with his friends. And boi those friends are lucky because he's always willing to listen to what's going on in other people's lives and he'll help them out in the best way he knows how... Netflix and Chill (and giving awesome advice). Everyone on the team has a story of Netflix and Chilling with Aaron. He'll watch just about anything with anyone at anytime. He'll people into shows like Samuria Jack, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Rick and Morty. He's also loves art, reading, smiling, laughing, hugs, and super sick handshakes. If you see Aaron walking assume he already knows what handshake you should do together. Give him some love, he'll give it right back :)

                    If you ever need help with any academic subject, there is no need to go to office hours, if you just ask Harry. Yet I rarely see him actually study. Do not be fooled by your first impression, because Harry has a sassy side to his silent and strong exterior, which comes out in the most unexpected situations. Having grown up in Bay Area, he drinks milk tea for lunch and drinks even more for dinner. In his free time, you can see him rock-climbing or winning at card games against his friends! If you take the time to get to know him, you will realize that he is a friend you can trust and depend on.  If you are interested in becoming friends with Harry, email him at 2smart4you@cornell.edu

                    Karen Zhan is currently a sophomore on PD and P&amp;P double majoring in Environment &amp; Sustainability and Info Sci. Her favorite color is blue, and she can usually be found napping somewhere sunny. Now that all the boring obligatory stuff is out of the way, Karen is the most laid back, chill person you’ll meet because she is basically a protagonist out of a YA novel. In her free time, she hangs with pet ducks and chickens, plays guitar and piano, dances, and tries art even though she claims she’s “not that good” at it. BS, Karen. Say hi to her if you run into her, she’s friendly and will probably say hi back.
