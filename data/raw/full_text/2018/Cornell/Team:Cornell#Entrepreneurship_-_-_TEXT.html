Entrepreneurship
Our team holds a great emphasis upon incorporating entrepreneurship throughout our projects. With this year’s project Oscillate, there are numerous opportunities to explore applications of our emergent technology. From cellular computation to co-culturing to nanoparticle control, this project can have a sizeable impact on a variety of domains. We look forward to discussing our innovations with the Cornell entrepreneurship community to greater assess the potential applications of Oscillate!
Oxyponics (2017)
Our 2017 project, Oxyponics - winner of Best Supporting Entrepreneurship - truly captured the essence of entrepreneurship from start to finish. By developing core aspects of the project at the Rev: Ithaca Startup Works incubator, our product development team was immersed in the startup atmosphere and gained contacts with investors and experienced creators throughout the summer. The business and operations team further explored the application of the product and developed business and marketing plans while establishing potential paths for the project’s next steps.
fishPHARM(2016)
Our 2016 project, fishPHARM, also utilized Cornell’s expansive entrepreneurship network to provide guidance as the project developed. The team spoke with Marla Coppolino, the Director of Business Development and Outreach for the Institute of Biotechnology at Cornell University to connect us to business experts on campus. At the McGovern Institute, fishPHARM was presented to industry professionals in order to help the team better understand consumer demands. In collaboration with eLab @ Cornell, team members pitched to potential investors.
At Cornell iGEM, we hope to develop products that can provide tangible solutions to global issues. Entrepreneurship is key to that mission as it instills a method of designing projects from idea to implementation. The Cornell community has historically been of great assistance in our project development and expanding the reach of our impact. With this year’s project, we focused on foundational advancements in synthetic biology and we are very excited to explore the applications of this new technology in the future.
