Public Engagement
We are a team composed entirely of undergraduates and we pride ourselves on our independence. The concept of a biological band-pass filter based on frequency was brainstormed and implemented by our team. Our wet lab team designed and cloned all sequences into pSB1C3, and transformed them for testing in DH5-Î± E. Coli. They also designed all experiments and worked to analyze all the data we collected. The product development group worked to create the mathematical model for the system based on Hill Kinetics. The sub-team worked on both the deterministic and stochastic model. The policy and practices team spearheaded our outreach efforts and led initiatives to contact and work with synthetic biology researches on our campus and beyond. To understand how our project might integrate into the field, they conducted interviews to find out about how developing technologies enter a new field.
