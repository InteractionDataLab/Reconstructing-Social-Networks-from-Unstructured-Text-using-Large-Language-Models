Testing
In order to test our genetic circuit, we designed a simple apparatus to fluctuate the temperature between approximately 37°C and 23°C. This temperature-alternating system consisted of a hot water bath and, a stand to hold a tube of bacteria, and a servo to move the tube out of the 37°C water environment and into room temperature. The servo was programmed and powered with an Arduino fio to rotate the tube up and down. The code, written in C, is displayed below:
The final set up with the programmed servo and hot plate is displayed below:
