Overview
We are building a biological band-pass filter. While biological band pass filters have been developed before, none respond to frequency-based inputs but instead respond to amplitude based inputs.                         By controlling the rates of degradation of the components of our system, we are putting together a frequency-response low-pass and high-pass filter to create a novel band-pass filter.
Our filter would allow bacteria to respond only to certain frequency-based inputs, and give it even more digital logic-like character, long a goal of synthetic biology. Moving forward, our project could be an important tool for scientists as synthetic biology branches into increasingly diverse fields.
