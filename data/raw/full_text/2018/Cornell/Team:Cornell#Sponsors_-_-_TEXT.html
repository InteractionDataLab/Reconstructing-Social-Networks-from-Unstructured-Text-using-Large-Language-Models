We would like to thank the Cornell College of Engineering for providing material, monetary, and other resources to the team. The Departments of Biological and Environmental Engineering, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, and Electrical and Computer Engineering have all provided resources and advice to the team.
Bio Basic Inc. is a privately owned dynamic biotechnology company. Over the past two decades, the company has developed rapidly and now serves as a one-stop-shop to researchers in the life sciences field. To date, Bio Basic Inc. has approximately 600 employees, seven laboratories, three factory buildings, 40 international distributors and over 10,000 customers worldwide. The team is grateful for Bio Basic's molecular biology services.
The mission of the Institute of Biotechnology is to promote research, education and technology transfer for applications of biotechnology for the benefit of the environment, agriculture, engineering and veterinary and human medicine. We would like to thank the institute for their monetary support to the team for the purchasing of laboratory supplies and equipment.
Corning Incorporated is the world leader in specialty glass and ceramics. Drawing on more than 160 years of materials science and process engineering knowledge, Corning creates and makes keystone components that enable high-technology systems for consumer electronics, mobile emissions control, telecommunications and life sciences. Corning graciously supported our team through donations of laboratory supplies and has been a strong supporter of Cornell iGEM for the past few years.
Integrated DNA Technologies specializes in DNA synthesis, gene construction, antisense oligos, molecular beacons and a variety of molecular biology products. We thank IDT for being an official sponsor of the iGEM competition and pro col-md-offset-1viding teams with 20kb of free gene fragments.
Founded in the mid-1970s as a collective of scientists committed to developing innovative products for the life sciences industry, New England Biolabs is now a recognized world leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of recombinant and native enzymes for genomic research. The team is grateful for NEB sponsorship of the iGEM competition, which has provided teams with the BioBrickÂ® Assembly Kit and other products such as DNA ladders and enzymes.
SnapGene offers molecular biology software that offers a fast and easy way to plan, visualize, and document molecular biology procedures. The team would like to thank Snapgene for providing us with licenses that we have used to help visualize our genetic constructs.
We would like to thank the New York State 4-H Youth Development Organization for their donation to our team.
As one of the largest consumer good corporations in the world, P&G, through its diverse array of brands, values innovation and consumer satisfaction. Cornell iGEM would like to thank P&G for their generous gift this season.
