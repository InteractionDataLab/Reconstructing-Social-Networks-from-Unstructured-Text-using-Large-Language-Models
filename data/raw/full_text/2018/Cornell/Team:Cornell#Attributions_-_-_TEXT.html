We are a team composed entirely of undergraduates and we pride ourselves on our independence. The concept of a biological band-pass filter based on frequency was brainstormed and implemented by our team. Our wet lab team designed and cloned all sequences into pSB1C3, and transformed them for testing in DH5-α E. Coli. They also designed all experiments and worked to analyze all the data we collected. The product development group worked to create the mathematical model for the system based on Hill Kinetics. The sub-team worked on both the deterministic and stochastic model. The policy and practices team spearheaded our outreach efforts and led initiatives to contact and work with synthetic biology researches on our campus and beyond. To understand how our project might integrate into the field, they conducted interviews to find out about how developing technologies enter a new field.
The InterLab study was conducted by out wet lab subteam, but would not have been possible without the generous support of our sponsors Corning - who supplied the materials necessary - and the Cornell Institute of Biotechnology’s Genomics Research Facility for allowing us to use their plate reader.
Oscillate would not be possible without the guidance and support of our advisors and organizations we’ve worked with:
Our wet lab research was conducted in Cornell Biomedical Engineering Instructional lab directed by Dr. Shivaun Archer. Dr. Archer provided us with all the necessary equipments including a gel imaging station, sterile hood, centrifuges, thermal-cyclers, and vortexes. She also oversaw lab safety and trained new members on lab safety measures.
Dr. Jan Lammerding for advising our team and allowing us to use instrumentation in his lab for protein purification and DNA quantification. His guidance and advice on our experimental design was invaluable.
In addition, we’d like to thank the following for their help and guidance:
Integrated DNA technologies for generously donating base pairs
Gibran el-Suleyman and Prof. Mike Thompson for helping us with team organization and business relations, as well as Cornell Engineering for providing a platform for us to compete in iGEM.
