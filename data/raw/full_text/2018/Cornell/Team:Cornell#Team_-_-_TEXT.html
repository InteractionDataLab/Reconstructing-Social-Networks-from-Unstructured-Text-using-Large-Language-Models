Rahul Rambhatla - iGEM Team Lead
Chemical Engineering '20
Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, Rahul Rambhatla. A truly mythological being in all sense of the word. His ability to solve the hardest ChemE problem sets only rivals his ability to resist the temptation of meat. Some might question why a chemical engineer leads a synthetic biology project team, Rahul is one of those people. He is not immune to the difficulties of this world however, on late nights you may find him swiping aimlessly on Tinder, but he carries a far bigger weight than most, the looming presence of arranged marriage. On most days you can find him in Weill or Duffield, and on truly (un)lucky days you may see him sporting one of his polos or t-shirts, with his dad bod on full display. Ride on Rahul, ride on.
Amith Punyala - Wet Lab Co-Lead
Biological Sciences & Chemistry '19
Amith Punyala (2018)
Pretty much any old Joe Schmoe can count cells under a microscope or click buttons on one of those new-fangled electronic plate readers.  But for what we in the trade know as ‚Äúwetwork‚Äù ‚Ä¶ you need a professional.  A professional like Amith Punyala.
After a long and distinguished career liquidating LB stock and spilling brain heart infusion, Amith retired to live a life in peace on his quaint plantation in Georgia, accompanied by his best friends‚Äîan exotic tame moth collection.  But just when Punyala thought he was out, he was pulled back in.  They stole his pipette tips and resold them on the black market.  They stored his plates upside down.  Worst of all, they destroyed his vintage -20 freezer.  This time, it‚Äôs no longer just another job.  It‚Äôs personal.
This autumn, Amith Punyala is out for vengeance, raising his Eppendorf one final time.  Watch in your local IMAX¬Æ theatre or convention center starting October 24.
Amy Zhong - Wiki & Design Lead
Computer Science '20
This is Amy, basically the most loved member on iGEM. She always comes in clutch when making the most beautiful and aesthetic pages of the website. Not only is she basically a goddess in CS, she is also extremely multitalented, enjoying tennis, hiking, and even cooking (especially in the video game Overcooked)! Even though she is basically in love with Jon Snow (and snow in general), she is definitely not cold in any way. She is actually extremely humble and kind, and always willing to help with anything (since she‚Äôs basically a genius at everything). She is just as adorable as the Baymax plushie that she treasures, and deserves all the happiness in the world :).
Ashwin Viswanathan - Wet Lab Co-Lead
Biological Sciences/Neurobiology & Government '20
Ashwin - a man with luscious hair often tied up in a captivating man bun, a man who towers over anyone he meets (I guess it‚Äôs fitting that both of his labs are on Tower Road). Now you would probably think that a tall, charming man like him would never be able to get along with a tiny girl like me (I don‚Äôt even reach his shoulders). Well, you‚Äôre right - we don‚Äôt. Whether it is giving each other unimpressed looks or him blasting compressed air at me after every few words that I speak, we just cannot seem to stop bickering with each other. But all in all, he‚Äôs a hardworking man that you can definitely count on.
Avisha Kumar
Electrical & Computer Engineering '20
Darren Tsai - Product Development Lead
Computer Science '20
Snake (n.) - 1. any of numerous limbless scaled reptiles (suborder Serpentes synonym Ophidia) with a long tapering body and with salivary glands often modified to produce venom which is injected through grooved or tubular fangs
2.  a worthless or treacherous fellow
Darren is a snake.
Greg Albano
Biological Engineering '19
Greg puts the sex in professexional. His biggest life accomplishment is getting 1069 likes on an instagram post about taco bell. When he's not busy being a douchebag, he's busy taking half-naked pictures of himself near vague bodies of water.
Isha Pradhan
Mechanical Engineering '20
As Katy Perry once said in her OG hit 'Hot 'n Cold', "You change your mind like Isha changes majors." But 2 years in, she is happily married to mechanical engineering. One might compare Isha to her best friend 'Hoot' as they both observe a noctural lifestyle. Even though she is low-key two-timing iGEM with another project team, she is a supremely caring and dedicated person.
Itai Levin
Chemistry '19
Swathi Chakrapani
Computer Science '19
Queen of casual roasting and well-meaning sarcasm, Swathi is like the pickle to the iGEM sandwich, addding the little zing you need for things to not go stale. If you ever worried about getting away with a comment that was very attackable, don't worry because Swathi will *call you out.*  But, she has another softer side too, also queen of telling you how #relatable your suffering is helping you calm down whenever your feeling overwhelmed. In her free time, find her cranking away at her CS assignments while simultaneously meme-ing everything.
Max Zhou
Biological Engineering & Computer Science '19
Behind a frail exterior, Max's spirit burns with a slightly less frail flame. A veritable powerhouse, Max can often be seen roaming the hallways of Weill Hall or the atria of Duffield pondering where exactly his life went wrong. However, Max is so unafraid of failure that he chose to major in two difficult STEM majors (Biological Engineering and Computer Science) so he could fail twice as much. The original formulator of our current project, Max's knowledge of seemingly inane facts amazes us all. A founding member of the iGEM Chicken Club, his clout (and determination to eat chicken wings) knows no bounds. As an aspiring...something, Max is a true Renaissance man, splitting his time between such diverse fields as cooking, research, crying, and occasionally, homework.
Maia Mirchandani
Operations Research & Information Engineering '19
As an Operations Research major, Maia is critical to the operations of Cornell iGEM‚Äôs research. Her entrepreneurial spirit drives the business sub team. She has supported many of the team‚Äôs efforts in fundraising, entrepreneurship, and patent seeking. When she is not busy sleeping in hot tubs, she enjoys tarnishing the online reputation of local public transportation services.
Raymond Zhang - Policy & and Practice Co-Lead
Chemistry '20
Bio student: the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell-iGEM member: üò§üò§ Don‚Äôt forget ‚õîÔ∏è‚õîÔ∏èthe powerhouse ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏èof iGEM ü§óüî¨Presenting Raymondüë®‚Äçüî¨üë®‚Äçüî¨, one of the hardest working üí¶üí¶members of the team.

Rohit Bandaru
Computer Science '19
Constantly working behind the scenes, one of the essential                      members of Cornell iGEM, our very own Rohit Bandaru!                      A senior/M.Eng student focusing in CS and ECE here,                      Rohit has held many important roles as a Wet Lab member                      and now Business team member of iGEM. As a result of                      Rohit interning at Amazon this past summer, his smile                      now always resembles an arrow. In his free time, Rohit                     has been known to enjoy working on autonomous                      bicycles and devouring the spiciest of foods.
Saachi Gopal - Business Lead
Computer Science '20
Hi, I‚Äôm Saachi. Majoring in CS and minoring in Applied Economics. Business lead, Adidas enthusiast, and Saachmaster. When I‚Äôm not coding, I‚Äôm probably spending too much time at Mehak. I love alpacas so much that I stuck a poster of one in my room and got a bunch of alpaca stickers for my laptop. Other than staring at alpacas, I like to blast music through my headphones and sometimes I worry I am losing my hearing. I wonder why.
Sneha Kabaria
Chemical Engineering '19
If you ever have trouble deciding between anything, go to Sneha. Sneha will figure out your life for you and make you feel like a better person, just be sure to catch her in Duffield any time after the sun goes down and before it comes up. She might be busy destroying ChemE problem sets, but she'll make time for you. Sneha's skills include matching her makeup perfectly with her intricately patterned clothes, and giving motivational speeches.
Yannie Mei - Policy & Practices Co-Lead
Mechanical Engineering '20
the life of yannie
black clothes >> any other color clothing
working overtime on weekends >> sleeping in
meche >> bme but also plants and bacteria 4 lyfe
farming all your own vegetables >> going grocery shopping
any other nickname >> being called yannifer
Yeojin Min
Chemical Engineering '20
Yeojin's Life Advice:
1. Rahul is fake
2. when working with black powders, wear white shirts so the stain is more apparent
3. ChemEs are snakes
4. It's all about the french tucks
5. food is life. life is food. but also cats. and dogs. and makeup.                     6. The most properest of greetings is friendo but yeojinnie minnie is also aight
Yun Ping Tseng
Computer Science '20
Not only is Ping a CS whiz, but she's also an incredible musician, sharing her musical talent with the world through flute ensemble and her love for piano. She also loooooves cats and hedgehogs...especially cats. More specifically, Ping is OBSESSED with Pooky the Munchkin, an instagram cat star (who is pretty freaking adorable). You'll probably have to scroll for ~five minutes of consecutive cat posts when looking through her insta feed. As a person, Ping is sweet and adorable but also one of the most reliable and capable people you'll meet who's ready to take on any challenge thrown at her. She's a true homie when you're struggling and dying in CS 3110 and 3410 :').
Fion Chu
Human, Biology, Health, and Society '19
Fion is like drinking warm kombucha on a hot summer day. The first sip is pungent, but the rest of the bottle is refreshing and delicious. Feon may not look it but she is a Senior majoring in Human Biology, Health, and Society, and what she lacks in size she makes up for in drive and ferocity. Faon has a ton of great character traits and is a born scientist/future physician. Let's talk about what Fuon would also be great at. Foin would be a phenomenal basketball player. Foen would be amazing at live television. Foan would be great at being an archaeologist. Foun would be probably the greatest White House Chief of Staff ever in office. More importantly however, noiF is an invaluable member of our team and it wouldn't be the same without her. We're truly lucky to have Fyon.

Carol Hung
Biomedical Engineering '19
Meet Carol, otherwise known as the CU Ghost! Legend says Carol originated from the distant lands of the Bay area in California. As a member of Cornell iGEM, she quickly rose up the ranks until she peaked, obtaining the coveted title of Sub-Team Lead. Unfortunately, in her junior year at Cornell, Carol contracted Med School Apps. Since then no one has heard from her, as she vanished off the face of the Earth. Every once in a while though, if he/she is lucky, a stray member may hear whispers in the basement of Weill Hall from this passed PCR Goddess or spot a brief glimpse of her at a casual G-body meeting.
Ann Metzloff
Chemical Engineering '21
Ann Metzloff, ladies and gentlemen! Many of you may know her as the namesake and co-creator of the (future) Nobel Prize-winning q5annMich PCR protocol, but she is much more than that. A chemical engineer by day, Ann moonlights as a lab queen by mid-afternoon, and she likes to spend her free time commuting to and from her dorm in Schuyler House. Zonk is one of the many words that she likes. If you need someone to get the job done, she's your girl! Night may have fallen before she's made it to you from Schuyler, but let me tell you, it's worth the wait. Gosh, if you want to know the one word that describes Ann best, read the first letter of every sentence.
Charles Dai
Biology, Chemistry, & Computer Science '21
Charles is like an onion. Not only does he make us cry, he's a multilayered person with potentially more than one positive quality. A hardworking, kind, and devout Christian boy, Charles seems to embody everything we'd want in our future child's spouse. However, peel back this layer, and you're confronted by a mass of degeneracy, tenuously held together by memes and K-Pop. We've only gotten to this layer, but I'm sure it doesn't get much better from here. Degeneracy aside, Charles is an integral member of the Cornell iGEM team, effortlessly juggling lab responsibilities with his double (triple?!) major and spontaneous bubble tea appointments. Expect things from Charles, some of which may be good, in the future.
Michelle Croen
Biological Engineering '21
A sophomore studying biological engineering, Michelle is an integral member of the wet lab subteam. She skillfully balances her schoolwork and lab work and is always willing to lend a helping hand. Her enthusiasm is clearly appreciated by others, and people are excited to see her wherever she goes! Michelle also has a keen sense for locating free food, which is much appreciated by her other teammates. When not working in the lab, Michelle amazes us all with her outdoorsiness and sense of adventure! She‚Äôs a member of Outdoor Odyssey and frequently enjoys trips camping and rock climbing. We are lucky to have Michelle‚Äôs dedication and talent!!
Jonathan Wang
Human Biology, Health, and Society '21
Have you ever come across a quokka? This previously endangered animal became internet famous and is known as ‚Äúthe happiest animal in the world.‚Äù Well look no further because we have our own quokka here on the team! Hailing from San Diego, this mans resembles the appearance of the cute smol animal like no other. If you ever need to find him, 99.99% chance he is in Uris library, sipping cocktails in the cocktail lounge. Be careful not to give him too much because he might just fall asleep on you. However, you must know that his drink of choice is tea. Although he doesn't have it often, when he does, he brews really big pots of tea.
Behram Khan
Biology & Anthropology '21
Behram b å-r√§m bae-r√§m
1.        Dude who can and will pull off any outfit be it a bucket hat, Jean jacket or light up shoes it will look good on him. Oh and don‚Äôt forget the classy penny board.
2.        Somebody who knows everything about cars, literally everything. You mention a season of Top Gear and he can tell you every car in every episode, including the bad ones.
3.        A caretaker of fish, who will care for them, scrub them and when it comes time, bury them properly.
His imagination is endless, his heart his huge so if you ever need some tips or want to bounce wacky ideas off somebody, or just want a wholesome conversation, just mention Jeff Buckley‚Äôs hair (which you should always be doing anyway) and Behram will show up to help.
Matthew Peroni
Mathematics & Biological Engineering '20
When you meet Matthew, the first thing you notice is his glorious beard. The second thing you notice is his definition. My Buddha, that man is so defined that he puts the dictionary to shame. His arms are just soooo.. *cough*...right, this is a bio about matt. So Matt likes to go to the gym, he works out pretty often. Whenever he does, he just looks so hot in that tight outfit. I often just love watching him squat because of that well defined A-...*cough*. Sorry, bad habits die hard.
Jackie Zheng
Computer Science '21
Jackie Zheng, a sophomore CS major, is a man of many talents and mysteries. His presence will leave you asking questions like: What is going on with that flowing mane? Why did he just randomly start doing push ups? How did he just make a perfect steak at midnight sporting nothing but briefs, with only a pair of chopsticks and some salt? Undoubtably questionable, Jackie has made great contributions to the team, most noticably through his ability to physically intimidate cells to do what we want by simply flexing over a petri dish. Though he has great technical ability, Jackie still puts the sexy in burning bread because somehow microwaving it was going to fix it. Wait.
Gloria Zhou
Chemical Engineering '21
Jennifer Zhou
Computer Science '21
This is the story of a woman named Jennifer. Jennifer worked for a company in a big building where she was Employee #7513. Employee #7513‚Äôs job was simple: she sat at her desk in room 7513 and she pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to her through a monitor on her desk, telling her what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what Employee #7513 did every day of every month of every year, and although others might have considered it soul rending, Jennifer relished every moment the orders came in, as though she had been made exactly for this job. And Jennifer was happy. Jennifer is a CS major.
Olivia Qiu
Biology '21
Meet Olivia! She answers to Olivia, Liv, Olive, and Ollie. She enjoys naps in the sun, tennis balls, staying hydrated, and lots of head pats. She knows how to sit, shake, roll over, and will come when called. Olivia loves bread, is good with kids, and doesn't bite. She gets really excited when meeting new people, so make sure you shower her with attention! She likes munching on snacks, dinner, walks, and must be well fed at all times. Olivia is looking for a lifetime companion and a forever home, so make sure to adopt today!!!
Emily Wang
Biology, Chemistry, & Business '20
If you've heard about Emily, you would know its hard to separate her facts from her mythos. There's this rumor that she runs multiple marathons a year and has a start-up for therapeutic devices... that she knows something about just about everything... that she is a writer, aspiring doctor, and designer... that shes currently traveling the world...But once you get to know her, you realize all of it is quite true, and that she is a kind and enthusiastic human being to boot!
Rachel George
Biomedical Engineering '21
If you didn‚Äôt think a room could get any brighter, just wait until Rachel steps foot in it. One of the cutest rays of sunshine you‚Äôll ever find on Cornell‚Äôs campus, Rachel is as fun and cheerful as the sprinkles she loves to eat. Rachel is fearless because she WILL. DRINK. THAT. BOBA. (and immediately take a Lactaid because ain‚Äôt nobody got time for lactose intolerance). You‚Äôll never catch her setting foot in Carpenter Hall unless the world is coming to an end (and even then it‚Äôs still debatable). When she‚Äôs not busy being a star BME student, Rachel can be found actively petting dogs and speed-walking to her classes.
Aaron Berman
Biological Engineering '20
Warning: This bio may be too wholesome for some. But that's because Aaron is the most wholesome human being you'll ever meet. When's he's not engineering biologically, doing experiments in the dungeons of Weill, and chucking gnarly tosses on the ultimate frisbee team, you can find him hanging with his friends. And boi those friends are lucky because he's always willing to listen to what's going on in other people's lives and he'll help them out in the best way he knows how... Netflix and Chill (and giving awesome advice). Everyone on the team has a story of Netflix and Chilling with Aaron. He'll watch just about anything with anyone at anytime. He'll people into shows like Samuria Jack, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Rick and Morty. He's also loves art, reading, smiling, laughing, hugs, and super sick handshakes. If you see Aaron walking assume he already knows what handshake you should do together. Give him some love, he'll give it right back :)
Harrison Cui
Computer Science '21
If you ever need help with any academic subject, there is no need to go to office hours, if you just ask Harry. Yet I rarely see him actually study. Do not be fooled by your first impression, because Harry has a sassy side to his silent and strong exterior, which comes out in the most unexpected situations. Having grown up in Bay Area, he drinks milk tea for lunch and drinks even more for dinner. In his free time, you can see him rock-climbing or winning at card games against his friends! If you take the time to get to know him, you will realize that he is a friend you can trust and depend on.  If you are interested in becoming friends with Harry, email him at 2smart4you@cornell.edu
Karen Zhan
Environmental Engineering '21
Karen Zhan is currently a sophomore on PD and P&P double majoring in Environment & Sustainability and Info Sci. Her favorite color is blue, and she can usually be found napping somewhere sunny. Now that all the boring obligatory stuff is out of the way, Karen is the most laid back, chill person you‚Äôll meet because she is basically a protagonist out of a YA novel. In her free time, she hangs with pet ducks and chickens, plays guitar and piano, dances, and tries art even though she claims she‚Äôs ‚Äúnot that good‚Äù at it. BS, Karen. Say hi to her if you run into her, she‚Äôs friendly and will probably say hi back.
