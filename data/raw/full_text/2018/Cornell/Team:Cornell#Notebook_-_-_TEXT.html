July 29th to August 4th
Wet Lab: We ligated previously digested High Pass 1a and High Pass 1b into pSB1C3 (to create High Pass 2a) as well as High Pass 1a and High Pass 1c into pSB1C3 (to create high Pass 2b). We performed PCR reactions for some parts we were running low on and then digested and ligated mf-Lon, sigmaF, and PhrpL, High Pass 1a, High Pass 1b, High Pass 1c, Low Pass 1b, and Low Pass 1c individually into pSB1C3 vectors. We heat inactivated and transformed our ligations into NEB 5-alpha Competent E. coli. Since we had been having trouble with transformations, we used SOC instead of LB for our outgrowth steps, with a positive outcome - colonies grew on all plates. We used isolated colonies to inoculate 5 mL liquid cultures which we miniprepped after overnight incubations. We also performed colony PCR reactions on assembled pSB1C3 vectors with High Pass 2a and and mf-lon inserts. We will continue with colony PCRs and run gels for them next week.

Business: Members are still reaching out to potential sponsors.
August 5th to August 11th
Wet Lab: We performed colony PCR reactions on assembled pSB1C3 vectors with inserts. We ran the colony PCR products on agarose gels but got only bands of about 300 base pairs, which indicated that our biobricks had not been successfully inserted into our vectros. After some troubleshooting, we realized that the antarctic phosphatase we had been using to dephosphorylate the pSB1C3 to prevent re-ligation  was expired and likely inactive. We ordered new quick CIP.
