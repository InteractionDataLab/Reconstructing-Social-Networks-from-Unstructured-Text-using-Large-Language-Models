Collaboration
Northwestern iGEM Team

We wanted to understand how our assay will work after traveling for a long distance, which led us to ship our assay to the Northwestern Team. After having them go through the test using water, we discovered that our instructions need to be clearer. When going through the protocol, the Northwestern Team misinterpreted how our assay should be used. Although we did not obtain results on how our assay worked after traveling, we did learn that we need to work on giving better instructions. How we changed our assay based on this collaboration can be seen here.

We also had the opportunity to help the Carroll iGEM Team with the traveling Mike the Microbe. We showed Mike our lab space in Indiana as part of their exchange to send Mike around the world.

We also helped the Marburg iGEM Team with their project working with BLISTA, a high school for visually impaired students in Europe. By following the guidelines on their Human Practices page, we were able to make our wiki more accessible to people with disabilities.
Special Thanks
