Zachary Hartley
Zach Hartley is a member of the Purdue iGEM team. His job is bringing in the big bucks. How big you ask? The biggest. Rumor has it that he's been called big bucks ever since he was a baby. Dang. How exactly is he so good at his job? It's simple. He begs all the flippin time. Even though Zach has only been begging for a couple of months he's found a way to bring instant pity and disgust to any and all companies he can get in contact with. Unfortunately, Zach will have to leave iGEM soon because he has been cast as the high sparrow in Game of Thrones, the king of the beggars. He's stopped wearing clothes around the lab, and it's clear he's stopped showering as well. Please help, you can text him at... nevermind he got rid of his phone. Send a carrier pigeon to the trash cans outside of Wiley. He's growing too powerful. Stop him befo

Zachary Berglund
The coolest dude on the team. Though not the most humble (also not correct). He's a Junior in Biological Engineering, though he rather says he's a Junior in the field of engineering everything. He has knowledge in manufacturing and design as well as prototyping. He also has a bit of coding experience. Outside of the work he does for the team, he is involved in well... too many things. President of a Residential Hall Club he is busy creating events as well as representing people in his hall. He also loves music and is part of Wiley Radio where he hosts a weekly radio and helps out putting on what seems free monthly concerts for the student council. He also enjoys a good game of MTG as well weekly DnD sessions. *Hint if there is a way to be a nerd at it, he is one. ex. Theatre Nerd, Gaming Nerd, Science Nerd,Otaku
