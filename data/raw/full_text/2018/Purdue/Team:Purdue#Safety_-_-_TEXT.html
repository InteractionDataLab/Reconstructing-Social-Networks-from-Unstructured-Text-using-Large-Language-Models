Safe Project Design
YeastID was designed using only BSL 1 chasses Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli using parts not harmful to humans/animals/plants. Although the idea of testing the functionality of expressed HRP in live yeast is convenient for the purpose of screening transformed colonies, we decided to use total cell lysate for data collection and in our final design to avoid the risk of spreading live genetically modified organisms.
Safe Lab Work
Prior to conducting any laboratory work, all Purdue iGEM team members underwent several training procedures in accordance with Purdue’s Radiological and Environmental Management (REM)* policies and Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI)** requirements.
Biological Safety Training
The topics covered included a discussion about the National Institute of Health Biohazard Risk Groups, personal protective equipment, proper handling of waste and biohazard spills, and security measures.
Laboratory Safety Awareness Training
We learned how to identify chemical hazards, read safety data sheets and chemical labels, minimize personal hazards, use safety equipment, and understand emergency response procedures and individual safety responsibilities.
Bloodborne Pathogen Training
We discussed what bloodborne pathogens are, how they are transmitted, and how to prevent and respond to exposure.
Standard Operating Procedures
We reviewed the procedures for storing and handling specific chemicals including hydrogen peroxide, TMB, and HRP. Additionally, we reviewed the protocols and procedures for the growth and storage of Escherichia coli st. DH5α and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Human Subjects Research Training
For the sake of our Human Practices survey, we received training on social sciences research involving human subjects, risk assessments, informed consent, and privacy/confidentiality.
Safe Shipment
We faced no safety problems sending DNA parts to the registry.
*REM governs the safety of biological labs at Purdue University [1]
**CITI provides training for safe, responsible, and ethical research [2]
