Collaboration
We mentored a new team, the Northwestern iGEM team. We also sent them a prototype of our paper-based assay to test its durability and its feasibility as a product.

Human Practices
Survey results were incorporated into our device. Furthermore, interactions with teaching younger kids synthetic biology in the form of an escape room helped raise awareness about science and STEM

Explanation
How Purdue has met the criteria?

Integrated Human Practices
IRB approved survey was sent to various types of people by using Amazon Turk. This survey allowed us to determine confusing components and other factors to be improved on the paper-based assay. From there, changes were made to the design to incorporate feedback about concerns. Labels were added to reaction zones. The layers of the assay was labeled. Other things were brainstormed to be included in the device, such as a way to check the "freshness zone" and a small electronic equipment to analyze the results and do a quick numerical comparison. Device steps were limited to what professionals in the field had said was the general requirements for an over the counter diagnostic.

Model Your Project
The model used michaelis-menten kinetics to model the reaction. This was then iterated using Markov chain to determine the best concentration of enzymes to use in our product.
