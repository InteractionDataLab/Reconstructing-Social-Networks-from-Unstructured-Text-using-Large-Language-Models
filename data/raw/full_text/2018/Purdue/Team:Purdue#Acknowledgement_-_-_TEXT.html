We would like to thank those that have helped make this project a success.
Dr. Kevin Solomon Purdue University, Professor for the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering. He served as our primary advisor and mentor.
Dr. Mohit Verma Purdue University, Professor for the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering. He served as another advisor for the team.
Dr. Jaqueline Linnes Purdue University, Associate Professor in Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering. She served as a primary source for our team's creation of the paper-based assay. She also let us use her lab for the creation of it.
Kok Zhi Lee Purdue University, Graduate Student and Research Assistant for Dr. Solomon, Graduate School in Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering. Served as an irreplaceable mentor for the team. Taught laboratory protocols and techniques. Answered an absurd amount of questions for the team.
Special Thanks
Monetary Support
In addition to those that have helped make this project a success through personal support. We also couldn't have possibly made this project a success if it weren't for those who gave monetary support.
Purdue College of Agricultural and Biological Engineering. They gave us X$ and have supported our team for x years. Without them our team wouldn't have made it off the ground.
Purdue College of Agriculture. They gave our team X$ and have supported our team for y years. Without them, our team wouldn't have made it off the ground.
Purdue College of Engineering. They gave our team x$ and have given money for y years. Without them, we wouldn't have been as successful was we have been.
Purdue Honors College. They gave our team x$ and have supported out team for y years. In addition to giving us money, they have supported students in the honors college on our team by allowing applications for grants to get more money for supplies. These applications are generally accepted.
Purdue Office of Executive Vice President of Research and Partnerships. They gave our team X$ and allowed us to make our project a success through their donation.
Summer Undergraduate Research Foundation. Besides offering additional workshops and support for interns in the program, they also helped pay them for the work during the summer. Without their support, we wouldn't have been successful.
Molecular Agriculture Summer Institute. Much like SURF, they've offered additional workshops and support for several interns on the team. They also helped pay them for their work. Without them, we wouldn't have been as successful
Additional support
Many others have offered help in some way and helped made our project a success. While they provided a minor role in the overall project, without their efforts there is no way this project wouldn't have been a success.
Purdue Research Foundation and Purdue Foundry and Dr.Abhijit Karve . They've helped our team by answering much needed questions relating to the patenting process as well as provide a bit of information on what businesses want to see in a possible product.
Ethan Brown, Logan , Jake, and everyone else in Solomonlab. They've helped answer many questions for the interns out of their own kindness. Without them helping out when needed our team wouldn't have been successful.
Taylor Moehling and Kristin Beyers from LinnesLab. They've provided much help and resources to our team and helped the team due to their natural kindness. Our team wouldn't have been successful if it weren't for their efforts.
David Scharberg, provided guidance and answered questions and offered advice for the development of the paper-based assay.
Dr.Lisa Lin, gave our team insight about what practitioners do  for yeast infections and helped provide feedback on what to prioritize on our design for healthcare professionals.
Special Thanks
to all those that made this possible
