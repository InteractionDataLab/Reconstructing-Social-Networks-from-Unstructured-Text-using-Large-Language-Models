Lina Lyng Sigfredsson Nielsen
I was involved with the planning and execution of the Biobrick Tutorial. Have been helping in contacting schools for the elementary school project and doing the presentations. Mostly, though, I have been involved in the mycolab and the overall work with the fungi: Determining ideal substrates and conditions for the bricks to grow as well as doing protoplastations and transformations of the fungi.
David Lokjær Faurdal
Initially, my involvement has been administrative in nature; planning meetings, brainstorming sessions, collaborations and the BioBrick tutorial. Since then, my main occupation has been the synthetic biology of the project, which entails a lot of (re)designing constructs and lab work (including the Interlab Study). Additionally, as team leader, I’ve interacted a lot with the other arms of the project to discuss all sort of details and trying to keep things coherent.
Jacob Mejlsted
I have been heavily involved with the creation of the high school iGEM team (CHSS) together with Tenna. In addition to this, I have been in charge of contact with Ecovative Design and helped with presenting in the elementary school project. With regards to lab work, I have been working together with David, Joen and Tenna in the synthlab with the assembly of BioBricks.
Hannah-Marie Martiny
In the beginning of the project, I organized a cabin trip for the team to do some team building, and later on, I’ve been working on analyzing the growth of the fungus  including both some image analysis and creating a model that simulates the microscopic hyphal growth. Furthermore, I have been assisting with the design of the wiki in regards to creating some of the graphics and other aspects.
Nicolai Jensen
My early involvement in the project was mainly about administrative work and planning some team building activities. I got involved in mechanical testing which led me to become the team's’ favorite fabricator. I made a budget hydraulic press and supplied the bio-folks with welded inoculator boxes until we decided that silicone ice-cube trays were better(they are). After designing our “brick” design, it was sent on to mechanical simulation. Lately, I’ve been doing compression tests of the fungus and will be designing and conducting tension tests in order to try to get Young's modulus of the fungus.
Lau Halkier Wandall
In the start I focused on ensuring that we chose a project, e.g. plan and book. Together with Mathias, I looked into different types of growth models. After looking at many different types, the coupling between model and reality was not as well-studied as hoped. I started working on modeling structural mechanics for the final structure as a test of realistic conditions. I also grew fungi under different conditions since MycoLab had some periods with very few people.
Tenna Gram Rasmussen
I was involved in a lot of branches throughout the project. I performed the Interlab study together with David, started the elementary school project and was heavily involved in creating the iGEM high school team (CHSS). I was one of the main responsibles who planned and executed the Biobrick Tutorial 2018, kept track of administrative work, worked on designing and writing a big part of the wiki, and I worked in the synthlab.
Joen Haahr Jensen
My efforts in this project have mainly been distributed in a threefold way: Fundraising, accounting and laboratory work. In the spring, I focused my time on applying for grants. Over the summer, I have spent my hours either being in the lab or thinking about being in the lab. Occasionally, in parallel to the rest, I have also brought forth a spreadsheet with expenditures and said “No, we cannot buy that.”
Mathies Brinks Sørensen
My involvement in the project has mainly been in the modeling part of the project. Particularly most of my time has been invested into statistical modeling as well as creating the experimental designs regarding compressive strength experiments. Furthermore, my involvement also included initial attempts in creating a growth model of the fungi via a hidden markov model approach.
Konstantinos Zifkos
My early involvement in the project was mainly about fundraising and generally being involved in the handling of the group economics. Later on, I was part of the mycolab where I focused on determining the optimal growth conditions of our fungi. Moreover, I was responsible for developing a protocol for the manufacturing process of our bricks.
Melissa Emilie McGrail
During this project, I’ve mostly been placing my energy in Human Practices where my main focus has been the collaboration with KU and Exeter. My competences in chemistry have been put mostly in consulting throughout the project.
Mathias Hoeg Boisen
Early on, my main focus was increasing the strength of the material, which has been the main drive in creating the statistical model. I’ve also worked on the collection of data, such as structural data, and design of experiments. I’ve worked on creating a simple growth model of fungi based on existing literature. This model can describe how fungi grow on a meso level, which means that its measurable quantity is explicitly density of mycelium. I’ve also been a part of creating the statistical model and helped gather structural data of the samples.
Alejandro Ventura-Traveset
During the first three months I focused in the economy group, where I was writing funding applications, creating budgets and booking accommodation and flights for the whole team. Then, I was part of the mycolab, where I carried out experiments related to fungal biology. I have been involved in culturing fungi, generating protoplasts, transforming fungi and other lab activities. Also, I have been in touch with several PhDs at the bioengineering department that have provided us with knowledge to continue with our project.
Michelle Lind Østrup
During the project my main focus was on creating a responsive wiki. I worked both with the wiki framework and the design aspect of it.
Instructors
Christopher Workman
Chris has been the supervisor for the DTU Biobuilders since the beginning and is always ready to answer any questions, be it about iGEM or science. He has done a lot for our team. We would not be the well-oiled machine we are today if not for him,  and we would probably be sitting in a corner crying if it wasn’t for his guidance.
Kyle Rothschild-Mancinelli
As an iGEM alumnus and PhD student working with fungi, Kyle not only knew when to push us to keep up with the time-schedule, but he always pushed us to factually justify anything we did for our project. His drive and expectation made us want to do better and he was the perfect second-in-command to Chris Workman.
Project Design
Lynn J. Rothschild,  Evolutionary biologist and astrobiologist at NASA's Ames Research Center
Our project goals were developed with Lynn after hearing her ideas for mycotecture on Mars in a presentation at DTU in the spring this year. Therefore, key project ideas and goals were provided to us from Lynn and we were encouraged to collaborate and complement our efforts with the Stanford-Brown-RISD team.   As the supervisor of the Stanford-Brown-RISD team and mother of Kyle, Lynn was the connecting point of both our projects. She had a strong vision for a two-parted project and managed successfully to convey the possibilities to us. Even though she is across the world, she has managed to visit us three times to guide us.
