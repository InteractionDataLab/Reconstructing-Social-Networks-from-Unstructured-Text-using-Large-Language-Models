BBa_K2799000
melA
Type
Coding
Length
1830
This BioBrick contains the coding region of melA codon optimized for Aspergillus oryzae by the DTU Biobuilders 2018. The optimization was performed on BBa_K193600 using the software tool, TaiCO , developed by the team in 2016.
BBa_K2799001
nat1
Type
Coding
Length
573
This BioBrick contains the coding region of the nat1 gene encoding a nourseothricin acetyltransferase, which confers resistance to nourseothricin (NTC). The sequence was kindly provided by Jakob Rendsvig and is codon-optimized for expression in Aspergillus oryzae.
BBa_K2799011
pCaMV - AmilCP - tCaMV
Type
Composite
Length
1290
This BioBrick encompasses the chromoprotein AmilCP for expression in fungi. It has the promoter and terminator from the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV).
BBa_K2799012
PgpdA - AmilCP - tCaMV
Type
Composite
Length
1623
This BioBrick contains the chromoprotein AmilCP for expression in fungi. It has the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter, PgpdA, derived from Aspergillus nidulans and the terminator from the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV).
BBa_K2799013
PtrpC - hph - tCaMV
Type
Composite
Length
1626
This BioBrick encompasses the gene hph, which confers resistance to Hygromycin B, for expression in fungi. It has the Aspergillus nidulans promoter PtrpC and terminator from the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV). .
BBa_K2799014
PtrpC - melA - tCaMV
Type
Composite
Length
2430
This BioBrick functions to increase expression of melanin in fungi. It contains melA, which encodes a tyrosinase involved in the first step of melanins biosynthesis, under control of the strong constitutive fungal promoter PtrpC derived from Aspergillus nidulans. Its terminator is derived from the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV).
BBa_K2799015
pCaMV - melA - tCaMV
Type
Composite
Length
2451
This BioBrick encompasses the melA gene for expression in fungi/eukaryotes, thus increasing expression of melanin. It has the promoter and terminator from the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV).
BBa_K2799021
hph selection marker + chromoprotein
Type
Composite
Length
2924
This BioBrick contains the hph selection marker and the chromoprotein AmilCP for expression in fungi.
BBa_K2799022
hph selection marker + chromoprotein
Type
Composite
Length
3257
This BioBrick contains the hph selection marker and the chromoprotein AmilCP for expression in fungi.
