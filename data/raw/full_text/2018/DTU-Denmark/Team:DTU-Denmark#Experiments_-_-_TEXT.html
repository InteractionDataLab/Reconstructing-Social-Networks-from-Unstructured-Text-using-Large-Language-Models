Resuspension of DNA/primer
DNA from IDT will typically be delivered in a white flaky substance, which needs to be resuspended before the DNA is ready for use.
Materials
Table centrifuge
EB/TE buffer or Milli-Q Water
Genes/Primers from IDT or other DNA provider
Procedure
Resuspension
Quickly spin the DNA down in the table centrifuge.
Calculate the amount of EB buffer needed to dilute the gBlocks to the desired concentration. Important: gene fragments and primers are not diluted to the same concentration:   The concentration of gene fragments is usually 25 ng/μL  and for primers it is 100 μM.
Note 1: DNA from IDT usually comes in dried flakes of 500 or 1000 ng of DNA. To achieve the desired concentration (usually 25 ng/μL) the needed amount of EB buffer is  40 μL (for 1000 ng samples) or 20 μL (for 500 ng samples).
Note 2: In order to calculate the molar amount of primer, use the NEB calculator.
Add the calculated amount of EB buffer/Milli-Q water.
Store the resuspended DNA at -20°C.

Digestion
Calculate the amount of gene fragment and plasmid backbone (A1) used for the digestion.
The recommended amount is 100 ng gene fragment and given that the standard concentration of resuspended DNA is 25 ng/μL, the needed amount is 4 μL.
Beware: For each digested gene fragment, one should prepare 50 ng of digested backbone (e.g. for 4 gene fragments one should prepare 200 ng of backbone).

Procedure
Quick-start protocol
Pellet 1–5 ml bacterial overnight culture by centrifugation at >8000 rpm (6800 x g) for 3 min at room temperature (15–25°C).
Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 μl Buffer P1 and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube.
Add 250 μl Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4–6 times until the solution becomes clear. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed for more than 5 min. If using LyseBlue reagent, the solution will turn blue.
Add 350 μl Buffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4–6 times. If using LyseBlue reagent, the solution will turn colorless.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top microcentrifuge.
Apply 800 μl supernatant from step 5 to the QIAprep 2.0 spin column by pipetting. Centrifuge for 30–60 s and discard the flow-through.
Recommended: Wash the QIAprep 2.0 spin column by adding 0.5 ml Buffer PB. Centrifuge for 30–60 s and discard the flow-through.
Wash the QIAprep 2.0 spin column by adding 0.75 ml Buffer PE. Centrifuge for 30–60 s and discard the flow-through. Transfer the QIAprep 2.0 spin column to the collection tube.
Centrifuge for 1 min to remove residual wash buffer.
Place the QIAprep 2.0 column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. To elute DNA, add 50 μl Buffer EB (10 mM TrisCl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of the QIAprep 2.0 spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.
If the extracted DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.

(potentially: 3 M sodium acetate - see procedure step 4)
Instruments

Scalpel
Table centrifuge for 1.5 mL microcentrifuge/Eppendorf tubes.
Procedure
Gel extraction
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel. Minimize the size of the gel slice by removing extra agarose.
Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg ~ 100 µl).
For example, add 300 µl of Buffer QG to each 100 mg of gel. For >2% agarose gels, add 6 volumes of Buffer QG. The maximum amount of gel slice per QIAquick column is 400 mg; for gel slices >400 mg use more than one QIAquick column.
Incubate at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). To help dissolve gel, mix by vortexing the tube every 2–3 min during the incubation. IMPORTANT: Solubilize agarose completely. For >2% gels, increase incubation time.
After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The color of the mixture will turn to yellow.
Note: The adsorption of DNA to the QIAquick membrane is efficient only at pH ≤7.5. Buffer QG contains a pH indicator which is yellow at pH ≤7.5 and orange or violet at higher pH, allowing easy determination of the optimal pH for DNA binding.
Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix.
For example: if the agarose gel slice is 100 mg, add 100 µl isopropanol. This step increases the yield of DNA fragments <500 bp and >4 kb. For DNA fragments between 500 bp and 4 kb, the addition of isopropanol has no effect on yield. Do not centrifuge the sample at this stage.
Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column, and centrifuge for 1 min at ≥10,000 x g (~13,000 rpm). The maximum volume of the column reservoir is 800 µl. For sample volumes of more than 800 µl, simply load and spin again.
Discard flow-through and place QIAquick column back in the same collection tube.
Optional: Add 0.5 ml of Buffer QG to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min ≥10,000 x g (~13,000 rpm). This step will remove all traces of agarose. It is only required when the DNA will subsequently be used for direct sequencing, in vitro transcription or microinjection.
To wash, add 0.75 ml of Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min ≥10,000 x g (~13,000 rpm). Note: If the DNA will be used for salt-sensitive applications, such as blunt-end ligation and direct sequencing, let the column stand 2–5 min after the addition of Buffer PE, before centrifuging.
Discard the flow-through and centrifuge the QIAquick column for an additional 1 min at ≥10,000 x g (~13,000 rpm). IMPORTANT: Residual ethanol from Buffer PE will not be completely removed unless the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation.
Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 50 µl of Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or H2O to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min at maximum speed. Alternatively, for increased DNA concentration, add 30 µl elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min. IMPORTANT: Ensure that the elution buffer is dispensed directly onto the QIAquick membrane for complete elution of bound DNA. The average eluate volume is 48 µl from 50 µl elution buffer volume, and 28 µl from 30 µl. Elution efficiency is dependent on pH. The maximum elution efficiency is achieved between pH 7.0 and 8.5. When using water, make sure that the pH value is within this range, and store DNA at –20°C as DNA may degrade in the absence of a buffering agent. The purified DNA can also be eluted in TE (10 mM Tris·Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), but the EDTA may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions.

Extension time can be increased to 40 seconds per kb for cDNA or long, complex templates, if necessary.
**When amplifying products > 6 kb, it is often helpful to increase the extension time to 40–50 seconds/kb.
After thermocycling the product can be stored at -20°C or be used for gel electrophoresis.
Colony PCR
By David Faurdal, adapted in part from NEB's one-taq protocol.
The purpose of this protocol is to confirm correct insertion of fragments after 3A assembly/GIBSON assembly into the pSB1C3 backbone. This is done by PCR amplifying the insert one is interested in and confirming that it's the correct size (by gel electrophoresis). As the backbone comes equipped with verification primer-binding sites, these primers, VF2/VR (sequences can be found here ), can simply be used if one does insertion into it. The protocol can, however, be used with different primers for different backbones. As the fragments run on the gel won't be used for cloning purposes there is no reason to use high-fidelity polymerases on this, just use one-taq.
Materials
Transformants from whatever assembly method you fashion
Eppendorf tubes
Sterile toothpicks/inoculation lops/pipette tips for transferring colonies
Milli-Q water
LB media with appropriate antibiotics
Procedure
Preparing the template DNA from the transformants
Pick a number of transformants, typically 3-10, from each plate of interest and mark them on the back of the plate.
Set up 2 Eppendorf tubes for each colony and mark them accordingly:
Fill the first one (1) with 15 µl Milli-Q water.
The other one (2) remains empty for now.
Transfer each colony to the Eppendorf containing 15 µl water using a sterile toothpick, inoculation loop or autoclaved pipette tip.
Transfer 5 µl of the water from (1) to the empty (2) tube. This tube (2) is now for safekeeping in case the colony PCR shows that the transformant in question contains the correct insertion.
Boil the (1) tubes for 10 minutes at 98 °C. Prepare the PCR mastermix, while the colonies are boiling.
Setting up the PCR itself
Set up a 25 µl reaction for each colony to be screened, as per NEB'S one-taq PCR protocol (see the protocol for troubleshooting).

Materials
Aspergillus protoplastation buffer (APB) 1L solution
Final conc: 1.1 M MgSO4 and 10 mM Na-phosphate buffer. (Hint: use 1 M solutions of Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4 to prepare the sodium phosphate buffer). pH is adjusted with 2 N NaOH to 5.8.
APB with Glucanex (40 mg Glucanex/ml APB)
Aspergillus transformation buffer (ATB) 1 L solution
Final conc: 1.2 M Sorbitol; 50 mM CaCl2·2 H2O; 20 mM Tris; and 0.6 M KCl. pH is adjusted with 2 N HCl to 7.2.
PCT (200 mL stock solution)
Final conc: 1.2 M Sorbitol; 50 mM CaCl2·2 H2O; 20 mM Tris; and 0.6 M KCl. pH is adjusted with 2 N HCl to 7.2.
Final conc: 50 % w/vol PEG 8000; 50 mM CaCl2;  20 mM Tris; and 0.6 M KCl. pH is adjusted with 2 N HCl to 7.5. Store PCT at 4 °C.
Procedure
Protoplastation
Collect the conidia from a plate by adding 5 mL of sterile liquid MM (or YPD for A. niger) with required supplements and firmly rubbing the colonies with a sterile Drigalski spatula. The conidial suspension is withdrawn from the plate and added to the shake flask containing 100 mL of media.
The culture is incubated over night (or 2 days for A. niger and other strains growing slower) at appropriate temperature and 150 rpm.
Harvest the mycelia and germlings by using Mira cloth.
Wash the mycelia with Aspergillus protoplastation buffer (APB) to remove the liquid media from the mycelia.
Resuspend the mycelium in 10-20 mL APB solution containing 40 mg Glucanex/mL APB. Homogenize mycelial and enzyme suspension gently to obtain the best possible digestion of the fungal cell wall.
Shake at the 30°C and 150 rpm for 2-3 hours.
Filter through Mira cloth and collect the flow through.
Add APB up to the total volume 40 mL.
Carefully make an overlay with 5 mL of 2 fold diluted Aspergillus transformation buffer (ATB). Dilute with sterile Milli-Q H2O.
Centrifuge at 3000xg (acceleration 9, deceleration 4) for 12 min.
Upon a successful protoplastation, a halo of white protoplast slurry is caught just below the surface. Collect protoplast slurry and transfer it to new tube.
Add ATB up to the total volume 40 mL.
Centrifuge at 3000xg (acceleration 9, deceleration 9) for 12 min. Discard supernatant.
Resuspend the protoplasts in approx. 1 mL ATB.
Transformation
Gently mix DNA and protoplast in an eppendorf tube (for a simple transformation 50μL protoplast is enough).
Add 150 μL PCT.
Mix by inversion of the tube.
Incubate 10 min at room temperature.
Add 250 μL ATB and mix.
Plate on osmotic stabilized, selective media.
Notes
The volume of DNA in water should preferably be kept below 25 % of the total volume of DNA-protoplast mix to avoid osmotic stress in protoplasts. The amount of DNA needed for a successful transformation varies with the type of DNA substrate.
For linear DNA, add ≈10 μL linearized plasmid
Use self-replicating plasmids as positive controls to test the competence of the protoplasts and evaluate the success of transformation. AMA1 plasmids (pLAT4-3): add ≈2 μL miniprep.
Remember to include a negative control plate, where protoplasts are plated without any DNA.

Procedure
Tissue Generation
Inoculate potato dextrose agar plates with a single piece of tissue from a stock plate.
Parafilm and incubate at 30°C for 5 days.
Scrape tissue from the agar surface and place into 1mL of potato dextrose broth in a microcentrifuge tube.
Avoid bringing any agar into the tube.
Vortex the tubes at full speed for 30-60sec.
Place tubes in a tube rack and secure with tape.
Place the tube rack in a shaker incubator so that the tubes are completely horizontal.
Incubate at 30°C and 85rpm for 24hrs.
Enzymatic digest
Centrifuge tubes at 10,000xrcf for 5min.
Gently discard supernatant.
Re-suspend tissue pellet in 1mL sterile water.
Invert tube several times and vortex briefly. Do not vortex too long or mycelium will begin to shear.
Centrifuge tubes at 10,000xrcf for 5min.
Gently discard supernatant.
Re-suspend tissue pellet in 1mL osmotic buffer.
Invert tube several times and vortex briefly.
Centrifuge at 10,000xrcf for 5min.
Gently discard supernatant.
Re-suspend tissue pellet in 1mL osmotic buffer.
Invert tube several times and vortex briefly.
Centrifuge at 10,000xrcf for 5min.
Gently discard supernatant.
Re-suspend tissue pellet in 1mL lysing solution.
Invert tube several times, but do NOT vortex.
Place tubes in a tube rack and secure with tape.
Place the tube rack in a shaker incubator so that the tubes are completely horizontal.
Incubate at 30°C and 85rpm for 19-24hrs.
Isolation of Protoplasts
Invert tube several times and vortex to detach and protoplasts from the central cell mass.
Place a 40µm cell strainer in a new 50mL centrifuge tube.
Use a 1000µL pipette to further suspend the lysate. Pipette the lysate into the cell strainer and allow to drain fully.
Pipette 1mL of the sorbitol solution into the microcentrifuge tube used in the digestion and invert for 1min to rinse any additional protoplasts.
Pipette this volume through the same cell strainer and allow to drain fully. Cell strainer can be gently spun to remove more of the solution.
Repeat steps 3-5 for remaining protoplast preps (up to 5 additional 1mL preps).
Pour an additional 6-10mL of the sorbitol solution into the cell strainer and allow to fully drain.
Remove the cell strainer from the centrifuge tube.
Gently invert the tube 5-10 times to thoroughly mix the solutions.
Place the tube in a tube rack at 4 °C and incubate for at least 24hrs.
Centrifuge at 10,000xg for 10min.
Carefully pour the supernatant into a new 50mL centrifuge tube. Try to avoid disturbing the pellet along the side and bottom of the tube. The supernatant can be stored at 4 °C and more protoplasts may be able to be isolated at a later date, if needed.
Re-suspend the pellet into 1mL of sorbitol solution and transfer to a new 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube.
Prepare a 1:10 dilution in sorbitol solution and count protoplasts via hemocytometer.
Store protoplast suspension at 4 °C.
Modifications and notes
There were no Driselase in our lab, so we did the protocol with three different concentrations of Glucanex: 20 mg/mL, 30 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL for the lysing solution after consulting Ecovative.
Second time we tried combining the protoplastation protocol we already had for A. oryzae. We used different conditions in three places with all in all 16 samples: 8 of them were incubated with a shaking speed of 85 rpm and 8 at a speed of 150 rpm. Of these 8, 4 of them were incubated for 2-3 hours and the 4 others for 19-24 hours. Each of the four samples had a different concentration of Glucanex for the digestion: 10 mg/mL, 20 mg/mL, 30 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL.
As there were no cell strainers in the lab, autoclaved funnels with mira cloth were used instead.
The third time we worked with 32 samples instead of 16. The conditions were still the same as the previous run but for an increased amount of mycelium we ran 2 two samples for each unique combination of conditions. Aside from this we also let the samples incubate for twice as long in the tissue generation part.
The fourth and last time we tried the protocol we had acquired Driselase and were, therefore, able to do the lysing solution according to the protocol. We still had no cell strainers, though, so funnels were still used. Aside from this 3 samples were made, all the same, and they were pooled together during the isolation of the protoplasts.

Spore Suspension
To obtain the spores generated from a plate culture in agar.
Materials
Milli-Q water
Mira-cloth
Autoclaved Funnels
Falcon tubes (50 mL)
Drigalski spatula
Procedure
Spore suspension
Pour Milli-Q water into the fungal culture with plates.
Rub the plate with the Drigalski spatula. Make sure the spores get into solution. Spores are hydrophobic and can spread easily into the surroundings.
After spores are in suspension, if more plates with the same spores are to be harvested, pour water and spores to the next plate. Repeat steps 1-3 for as many plates you have.
Set a filter (funnel + mira cloth) on a Falcon tube.
Pour Milli-Q water + spores onto the mira cloth and filter solution. Make sure all liquid goes through the filter.
Do a second filtration on a new Falcon tube and filter. Make sure all liquid goes through.
Spore counting
Make 1:100 dilution with the spore suspension (only 10 µL needed).
With a counting chamber under the optical microscope, put 5 µL of the dilution into the center of the chamber. Count spores in one of the squared cells.
Calculate spore concentration.
