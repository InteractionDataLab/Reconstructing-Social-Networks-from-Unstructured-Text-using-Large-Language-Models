Our project goals were developed with Lynn after hearing her ideas for mycotecture on Mars in a presentation at DTU in the spring this year.

As the supervisor of the Stanford-Brown-RISD team and mother of Kyle, Lynn was the connecting point of both our projects. She had a strong vision for a two-parted project and managed successfully to convey the possibilities to us. Even though she is across the world, she has managed to visit us three times to guide us.
