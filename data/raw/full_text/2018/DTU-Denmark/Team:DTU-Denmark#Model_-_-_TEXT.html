Modeling
Modeling in the biological sciences provides a great tool for investigating and predicting outcomes based on a variety of different parameters.
From studying the fungal behavior in details to the structural behavior of the mycelium-based structures, we have been applying four different approaches to solve some of the problems and increase our understanding of the processes involved in the project.
The whole idea of basing structures on fungal mycelium relies on the growth and the optimization of the basic physical and mechanical properties of the fungus. We have therefore developed two different approaches to simulating the biomass growth; a detailed model following the location of hyphae and locations and another one involving applying a system of partial differential equations (PDE) that models the biomass movement .
When you change the characteristics of the mycelium, the structural properties will most likely also be influenced. The study of this has therefore been carried out by designing the building materials , testing the designs and testing out whether the mycelium can withstand the pressure needed .
