#FollowMeToiGEM
OUR COLLABORATION
We, The EureCAS, have a very sacred ritual - we take pictures wherever we go (yes, even at Starbucks *not  spon*) and we really seemed to like the trend #FollowMeTo. As a collaboration idea, this came to mind a few days after we got back from Greece. We had so many cool pictures to share with the world and wanted to include more people in on our little tradition. Not only is it a way to share your teamâ€™s feats around the world, but also feel more connected with other iGEMers, as we all go down the same road.
