Integrated Human Practices
✔
“The 65 SynBio Roses” campaign served as an important platform for us to be able to tell our story, but, also, receive overwhelming amounts of feedback. We chose our very publicly oriented approach in order to engage as large of an audience as possible. This helped us learn the perspectives of people that do not know much (or at all) about science and showed us the many ways others’ opinions and ideas can have an impact on your own.

Social campaigns aside, we tried and improved a previous part in order to give back to the iGEM community.
