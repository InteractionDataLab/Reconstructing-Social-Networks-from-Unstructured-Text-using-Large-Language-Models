OUR COLLABORATIONS
Our most meaningful collaboration was with Team Athens.  We mentor them and we were mentored by them. Exchanging ideas with them was  really helpful for us. We also helped their team by sending them our measurement  kit for InterLab, because we didnâ€™t participate in it, but they did.  And the best of all are the friendships we made!
