Special award - Kalina
Education and Public Engagement
✔
When we were kids, all three of us held immense curiosity for our surroundings, we wanted to know how things worked and what made them work.. Stemming from our own passion and experiences, we wanted to dedicate as much time and attention as we could to children as hungry for knowledge as we were. We couldn’t have been happier by the fact so many bright minds decided to join us in our “The 65 SynBio Roses” campaign. Our winner, Kalina, was promised a tour around our lab and the opportunity to draw with real bacteria instead of pen and paper, but she wanted so much more. She strived for knowledge. And we obliged. She even brought her little brother, because she “wanted him to see the beauty of science”.
