SAFETY
WHO WILL USE OUR PRODUCT
Our target audience consists of scientists and clinicians interested in the detection of the Delta F508 mutation , responsible for approximately 70% of the Cystic Fibrosis cases in Bulgaria and Europe as a whole. Our system is pla nned to be used only in a controlled environment.
IS IT SAFE?
Not only is it safer than any other technology that does the same thing,  but it is also drastically cheaper and vastly beneficial due to its simplicity  -  it does not require DNA sequencing for the detection step.
USED ORGANISM STRAINS
# Escherichia coli - DH5Î± strain
# Escherichia coli - TOP10 strain
POTENTIAL RISKS
Our project poses the typical risks of working with a level 1 GMO.
WASTE TREATMENT
All biological materials and equipment used for handling were collected separately and autoclaved.
EMERGENCY REACTIONS
If lab coats or clothes start burning:
emergency showers
If acids or other harmful liquids get in the eyes:
eye showers
If injuries occur:
treat them with first aid-kits, report the injury, go to the hospital if necessary
If solutions with GMO are running down the bench:
swap and disinfect the place with NaClO (bleach)
PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
Eye protection
Lab coats
Safety glasses in special areas of the lab
(should be used in other areas if necessary)
OTHER RULES
Do not work alone!
There should be at least one person in the lab with you.
Do not pipette with your mouth!
Disinfect hands after contamination with GMOs!
Disinfect hands and wash them after working in the lab!
Do not eat, swallow, wash and snore with any chemicals!
Do not bring food, drinks, pets and snacks in the lab!
