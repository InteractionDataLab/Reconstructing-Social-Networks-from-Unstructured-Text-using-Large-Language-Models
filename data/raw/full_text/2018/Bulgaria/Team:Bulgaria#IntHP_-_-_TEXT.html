Kalina's Roses
The winner of our rose drawing contest, Kalina, was given the opportunity to work in our lab for a day. She came with her little brother and together they learned how to work with a pipette, how to run the centrifuge and the most important rules for safe work in a lab. Kalina joined our initiative on the Association of 65 Roses and drew several beautiful roses in petri dishes with real bacterias.
