PROJECT CONTRIBUTION
In the initial stages of our work, we generated and tested the expression of 5 chromoprotein constructs to try our protocols. All of them were cloned into a pSB1C3 vector with a strong promoter and a potent RBS site. Under these conditions, most of the proteins showed as a severe metabolic burden to the host cells, leading to small sizes of the colonies and color loss upon re-cultivation. The exception was the amilGFP protein - was stable enough to be used under the control of a strong promoter and on a high copy number vector. We also measured its growth kinetics in comparison with the standard pSB1C3 vector with a red color device. All data could be viewed at the corresponding page of the registry.
