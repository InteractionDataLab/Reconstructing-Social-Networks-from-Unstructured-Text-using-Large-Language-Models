SURVEY
After filling out so many other teamsâ€™ surveys, we decided to jump on the bandwagon and compile one ourselves. At first, conflicted about what it should be about, we stumbled upon a good amount of questions we need answers ourselves in the course of our work. Generally speaking, our survey regards CRISPR, GMOs, ethical problems and genetic testing. We received an amazing amount of support from other teams and got a good idea whether our project could be successful.  Here are the results:
