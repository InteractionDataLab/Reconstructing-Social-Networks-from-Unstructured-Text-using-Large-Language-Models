Welcome to
Tongji_China!
We focus our attention on
cancer therapy and T3SS to
create a new method to
present the promising individual
cancer antigen -“Neoantigen”.
Background
We use the bioinformatic method
to filter our item antigens and
use the T3SS in
P. aeruginosa to deliver
them to the T cells through
oral intake.
Design
Description
We filter the antigens of interest.
Then we conduct the experiments
to prove that our system can work
efficiently and safely.
