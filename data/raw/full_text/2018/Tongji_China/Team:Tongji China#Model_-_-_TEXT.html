Overview
With information of colorectal cancer mutations from the TCGA database, we use “mutated” CDSs centered by the mutation sites and use an 8~14aa long slide window to cut the amino acid sequences around each mutated site. Then we put these amino sequences into NetMHC and predict their immunogenicity. We choose strong biding peptides for later use.
