Accomplishment
Since the team was established in March, we have worked a lot for our projects. During these months, we determined the topic of our project, found instructors and laboratories, built the plasmids and transformed the engineered bacteria, detected the protein of interest, and verified the bacteria’s functions. With the progress of the project, in order to make our project more beneficial to humans, we have carried out a wealth of human practice such as telling middle school students about cancer-related knowledge, visiting pharmaceutical companies, surveys, and interviewing doctors. Of course, we have also collaborated intensively with other teams. We participated in the 5th Conference of China iGEMer Communication, and helped SKLMT-China iGEM team complete a part of their lab. We invited students from team SJTU-BioX-Shanghai together to visit the Roche Pharmaceutical Factory, and obtained a plasmid we needed with help from team SSTi-SZGD.
Through our efforts, we successfully constructed a plasmid containing T3SS system with neoantigen, transformed the attenuated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proved that the engineered bacteria have the function of causing a specific immune response. Our program will provide a safer and cheaper approach to cancer treatment in the future.
