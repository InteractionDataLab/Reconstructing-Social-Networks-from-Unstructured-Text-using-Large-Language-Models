Overview
Here is the team Tongji-China. We are a group of students from the School of Life Science and Technology of Tongji University in China, and we are all undergraduates. Perhaps our current understanding of scientific research is not enough, but we all have great enthusiasm for synthetic biology. We all believe that our efforts will make sense this summer.
This is a team of 11 people, including 2 boys and 9 girls. If you want to know more about us, please click on the link below.
