Medal Criteria
 Bronze Criteria
1. Register for iGEM, have a great iGEM season, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Check!  See our team information here.
2. Competition Deliverables
Check! You can visit our booth to see our poster and presentation at the Giant Jamboree. Visit our  Wiki  and  Judging form   by clicking on the links.
3. Attributions
Check! See our attributions  here .
4. InterLab Measurement
Check! We have completed the interlab measurement this year. See our results  here !
 Silver Criteria
1.  Validated Part
Check! We have validated and well characterized the dCas13b-ADAR2DD ( BBa_K2818002 ) and dCas13d-ADAR2 DD ( BBa_K2818001 ). See our results for validating and characterising important design parameters of these parts  here .
2.  Collaboration
Check! This year we have collaborated with   NUS-Singapore-A ,  Macquarie Austrailia   and  UI-Indonesia . See our details for collaboration  here .
3.  Human Practice
Check! This year our human practice focuses on investigating the public attitude of gene editing in Singapore and in the Asia region. We have conducted a series of social studies and engagement with the public. See our human practice  here .
 Gold Criteria
1. Integrated Human Practices
Check! Through interactions with different stakeholders in the discussion of gene editing, we have integrated the conclusions we draw from human practice to evolve our project. After human practice, we felt the great importance to develop RNA editing technology and realize better transcriptome analysis and include them as a part of our project. See our integrated human practice  here .
2.  Improvement on a Part
Check! This year, we use DNA binders and DNA binding peptides to futher improve the transcriptional activation activity of the truncated dCas9 constructs. The new and improved truncated dCas9 broke through the threshold for improvement we faced in the previous year. See our part improvement  here .
3.  Demonstration
Check! We have demonstrated the successful targeting and A-to-I base change by our dCas13b-ADAR2DD and dCas13d-ADAR2DD on mRNAs of the endogeneous gene in cancer cell model, illustrating great potential for the application of the constructs for therapeutic purposes. See our real life demonstration  here .
