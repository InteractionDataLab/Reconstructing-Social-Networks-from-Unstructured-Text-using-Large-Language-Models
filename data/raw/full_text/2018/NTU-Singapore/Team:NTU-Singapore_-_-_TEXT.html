A CRISPR/Cas Base-Editing Toolkit
From Genome to Transcriptome, From Modification to Detection.
Our Story
A Continuation and Beyond.
CRISPR/Cas9 DNA Base Editor
With the successful truncated dCas9-mediated transcriptional activation last year, we moved further this year into DNA base editing using CRISPR/Cas9 system. We also improved our truncated dCas9 further with novel strategies for higher binding efficiency.

Human-Centered Research
Our research involves not only the students and scientists, but also the Singapore public. While doing our project, we looked into the public opinions towards gene editing. Our human practice tells how our project evolved around the local community that we live in. 
Integrated Human Practice
Adapt to Change.
CRISPR/Cas13 RNA Base Editor
As we have learnt through our interviews with medical doctors and interaction with the public, it is evident that RNA editing is a hidden gem of gene therapy that awaits to be explored. Hence, we evolved our project and ventured into RNA editing.
Proejct REPAIR
Aim Even Higher.
Modification-Sensitive Nanopore Sequencing
To address the public concerns around RNA editing technology, we designed an unbiased, accurate RNA sequencing tool. Expanding the nanopore sequencing platform, we hope to enhance the safety of RNA editing and reduce its cost.
