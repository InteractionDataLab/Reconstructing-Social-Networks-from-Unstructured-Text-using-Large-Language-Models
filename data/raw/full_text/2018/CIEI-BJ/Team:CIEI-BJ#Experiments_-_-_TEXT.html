Characterization
Figure 1. The design of our eYFP reporter in Aflatoxin-sensing system
This scheme shows the working principle of our aflatoxin (AFT) biosensor system. Two anti-AFB1 single chain variable fragments (ScFv) targeting different affinity sites of AFT were fused with Gal4 transcription activation domain (AD) and DNA binding domain (BD) respectively. In the presence of AFB1, the two anti-AFB1 ScFvs could be drawn near, enabling the association of Gal4 AD and BD, and thus driving the expression of genes under the Gal promoter. At the same time eYFP protein was also expressed under this condition.

The result show that the three clones in AFB1 flat are not stranger than in flat without AFB1; on the contrary, Sv1+Sv2 clones in AFB1 flat is stranger. And in the chart, the yeast with BacC gene is bad than the control. For next, we will check more OD value in different time and take 3-AT to inhibit self-activation in the control, then continue the work. And other vectors have transformed yeast for analysis.
Fig. 2 Expression from pGal promoter can be induced in the presence of AFT.
The yeast cells transformed with two plasmids were cultured in SD-His media with no Aflatoxin B1 (control) or 100 ug/L (100 ppb) AFT B1. According to our design, the presence of AFT B1 should facilitate the association of Gal4 AD and BD, thus driving the expression of His3 protein under the endogenous Gal1 promoter, and enabling yeast growth in SD-His media. The yeast growth (OD 600) was measured every 2 hour for 14 hours on end, and the growth curve clearly showed that, compared to control, the presence of AFT B1 significantly promoted the growth of the yeast. Therefore, the results shows the similar changes with AD-ScFv1 (BBa_K2247008) and BD-ScFv2 (BBa_K2247009). Besides this, the candidate genes which may degrade AFB1 shows very hard to growth in SD-His media. Whether these genes are really working, should be further confirmed by more experiments.
Fig. 3 Experimental validation of eYFP Aflatoxin-sensing system
This diagram shows the experiment the eYFP is working under the AFB1 existing conditions in the yeast cells. According to our design, the presence of AFB1 should lead to the association of Gal4 AD and BD domains, and drive the expression of eYFP enabling the yeast show yellow fluorescence under excitation light.
Fig. 4  Western bolt to confirm the EYFP protein can be induced in the presence of AFT.
The yeast cells were cultured in SD-His media with 100 ug/L (100 ppb), 5mg/L (5000ppb) Aflatoxin B1. And cells cultured in SD-Trp/-Leu with no AFB1 (control). According to our design, the presence of AFB1 should facilitate the association of Gal4 AD and BD, thus driving the expression of His3 protein under the endogenous Gal1 promoter, and enabling yeast growth in SD-His media. Before loading samples all proteins were normalized by Bradford method. Results showed that, compared to control, the presence of AFB1 can induce the protein content of eYFP. Therefore, we believe the two anti-AFB1 antibody single-chain variable fragments (ScFv1, BBa_K2247006, and ScFv2, BBa_K2247007), as well as the fusion proteins AD-ScFv1 (BBa_K2247008) and BD-ScFv2 (BBa_K2247009) function well as expected.
Soluble expression of ADTZ in E．coli and the degradation of aflatoxin B1 by ADTZ
In order to express soluble ADTZ in E. coli，the DNA coding ADTZ was inserted into the vector pMAL-c5x to produce the fusion protein of malte-binding protein (MBP) and ADTZ.

A 2.1kb fragment was obtained by PCR from synthesized ADTZ template with primer AD2 and AD3. A 5.6kb linearized vector fragment was obtained by PCR from pMAL-c5x template with primer MAL1 and MAL4 (Fig.5). Then In-Fusion reaction for the two fragment was carried out. The colony was identified by PCR with primer MAL and AD, and the product of PCR was about 560bp(Fig.6). The positive colonies were sequenced further.

expression of MBP-ADTZ
Firstly the vector pMAL-c5x-ADTZ was transformed into E.coli BL21 Gold DE(3). Then an overnight culture of the bacteria was inoculated into LB broth containing 2g/L glucose and 100mg/L ampicillin. After 2h culture at 37 oC and 200rpm, recombinant protein production was induced by addition of 0.3 mM IPTG at 20oC and 200rpm for 24h. The cell was collected by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in H2O about an OD600 of 30. Then the cell was disrupted by sonication. The results showed that most of highly expressed MBP-ADTZ(119kDa) was soluble(Fig. 7).

degradation of aflatoxin B1 by MBP-ADTZ
The degradation reaction of aflatoxin B1 was performed in a final volume of 700 ul composed of 150ul H2O, 350 ul buffer(100mM Na2HPO4, 50mM citric acid, 0.4mg/L aflatoxin B1, pH6.0) and 200ul crude MBP-ADTZ obtained after sonication. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 30 oC without shaking for 0, 3, 6, and 12 h. After incubation, aflatoxin B1 was extracted three times with 700ul chloroform. After the chloroform was evaporated under nitrogen gas, the samples were dissolved in 140ul acetonitrile and analyzed by HPLC. HPLC analysis was performed using Diamonsil C18 column (250×4.6 mm). The mobile phase was acetonitrile/water (45:55, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and the sample temperature was 28oC. The detection wavelength was 360 nm. The result showed that MBP-ADTZ was able to degrade AFT B1 obviously(Fig.8).

degradation of aflatoxin B1 by ADTZ-pYES2
ADTZ-SC gene was inserted into vector pYES2 and transformed into yeast strain INVSc1. In order to examine if yeast can degrade aflatoxin, this chemical was added into the media when protein expression was induced. The protocol is:
1、Incubate yeast, transformed with either pYES2-empty vector or pYES2-SC, in SC-U+Glc media for 2 days.
2、Incubate in SC-U+Glc+Aflatoxin (5mL) for 24 h, different amount of aflatoxin was used as:
pYES2 no aflatoxin
pYES2+0.05 mg/L Aflatoxin（5 μL50 mg/L Aflatoxin）
pYES2+0.5 mg/L Aflatoxin（50μL50 mg/L Aflatoxin）
pYES2+2 mg/L Aflatoxin（200μL50 mg/L Aflatoxin）
pYES2+5 mg/L Aflatoxin（500μL50 mg/L Aflatoxin）
pYES2-SCno aflatoxin
pYES2-SC+0.05 mg/L Aflatoxin（5 μL 50 mg/L Aflatoxin）
pYES2-SC +0.5 mg/L Aflatoxin（50μL 50 mg/L Aflatoxin）
pYES2-SC +2 mg/L Aflatoxin（200μL 50 mg/L Aflatoxin）
pYES2-SC +5 mg/L Aflatoxin（500μL 50 mg/L Aflatoxin）
Note: Aflatoxin is dissolved in ethanol, in case the yeast growth could be suppressedby ethanol, evaporate half amount of the ethanol then refill with same amount of water.
3、24 hours after induced by galactose, 1 mL cell culture was taken and mixed with 1 mL chloroform to isolate aflatoxin, repeat isolation fo 3 times. After drying up by nitrogen, samples were dissolved in 100 μL methanol and apply 15 μL for HPLC analysis. The result shows chromatographic peaks of aflatoxin can be detected after aflatoxin, with a final concentration of 2 mg/L and 5 mg/L, was added to yeast transformed with both pYES-empty vector and pYES2-ADTZ. However, yeast transformed with pYES2-ADTZ has no significant difference in the aflatoxin peak area comparing to yeast transformed with empty pYES2 vector.

Equal volume of acid-washed glass beads  added and vortexed for 30s, then incubate on ice for 30s, repeat for 7 times. Then samples were centrifuged at 4℃ for 5-10 min, 10000 g, and the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube.
The in vitro enzyme activity was analyzed in 500uL system with a final concentration of aflatoxin at either 0, 0.05, 0.5, or 5 mg/L. 50uL total yeast protein was added, and the reaction buffer was 0.2M disodium hydrogen phosphate-0.1M citric acid, pH 6.0, incubate at 30℃ for 24 hours. Chloroform was used for isolation, and after nitrogen air drying and dissolved in methanol, samples were examined by LC-MS. The result is shown below, yeast transformed with pYES2-ADTZ has no significant difference in the aflatoxin peak area comparing to yeast transformed with empty pYES2 vector.

From the top: 1. Standard Aflatoxin; 2. pYES2 yeast without aflatoxin; 3. pYES2 yeast with 0.05mg/L aflatoxin; 4. pYES2 yeast with 0.5mg/L aflatoxin; 5. pYES2 yeast with 5mg/L aflatoxin; 6. pYES2-ADTZ yeast without aflatoxin;7. pYES2-ADTZ yeast with 0.05mg/L aflatoxin; 8. pYES2-ADTZ yeast with 0.5mg/L aflatoxin; 9.pYES2-ADTZ yeast with 5mg/L aflatoxin.
