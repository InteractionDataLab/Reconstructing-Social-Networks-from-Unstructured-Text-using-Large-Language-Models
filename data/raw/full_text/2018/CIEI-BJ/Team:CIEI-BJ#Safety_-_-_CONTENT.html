As aflatoxin is highly poisonous, safety in lab design and lab work is extremely important. The laboratories in which we conducted our experiments were all safety level 1/2 and every experiment was completed in accordance with our safety protocols. Our advisors have stressed the importance of following safety regulations.</P><DIV class="first-level" id="a2">Project Design Safety</DIV><P class="my-content">The core of our project is testing the degradation of AFT B1 processed by four different enzymes. The enzymes involved in the process are BacC, ADTZ, MNP and F420, and the substrate is AFT B1. Aflatoxins are carcinogens and mutagens and should be handled as teratogens with extreme caution. Before beginning the experiments, during the design stage, all of our team members and instructors studied and understood the potential damage (including short and long term damage) of AFT B1. Due to the toxicity of AFT B1, we have optimized our experiment procedure to minimize damage. Any operation directly connected with AFT B1 was done under the supervision of teachers. Our circuit contains YFP which emits fluorescence and therefore does not require extra operation and before the circuit, we used inducible promoters to control the expression.</P><DIV class="first-level" id="a3">Lab Safety</DIV><P class="my-content">Before conducting the experiments, all of our team members received safety training about how to operate correctly and safely in the lab. We also studied the hazardous substance safety sheets on advice of the iGEM headquarter.</P><P class="my-content">Because we are all high school students, all experiments were done with teachers present and laboratory rules were strictly followed, which include:</P><P class="my-content">1. Everyone has to wear lab coat, goggles, and rubber gloves when conducting experiments to avoid potential inhalation and contact.</P><P class="my-content">2. Food and drink is prohibited in the laboratory.</P><P class="my-content">3. Slippers are not allowed in the laboratory.</P><P class="my-content">4. Experimental areas and other areas are clearly separated.</P><P class="my-content">5. Hands and forearms are sterilized with alcohol before using the bench-top.</P><P class="my-content">6. Toxic chemicals including AFT are carefully dealt with and disposed of correctly after use.</P><P class="my-content">7. All equipment is turned off and all the electricity is cut before the last person leaves the laboratory.</P><P class="my-content">Since our project is related to AFT B1, experiments with aflatoxin were our main focus. Every procedure was done with high concentration and all waste was dealt with carefully to minimize the harm to the public and us.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER><DIV class="sponsor"><DIV class="sponsor-txt">Sponsors</DIV></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
