Team
CIEI-BJ is made up of 15 teenagers from 13 different schools in China and several knowledgeable advisors. We gathered as a team in February and are determined to deal with the human health threater aflatoxin using our system method. Everyone in the team contributes to the project and we are all hoping for a delightful result.

Teachers
Xiaoxia Qu
Instructor
I am a biology teacher in an international school. I participated in the iGEM project of CIEI-BJ by delivering the basic knowledge of molecular biology to the students, helping them form team spirits, guiding them in scientific writing and training them in doing scientific presentations.
Zheyong Xue
Adviser
I am one of the advisers of team CIEI-BJ. I have mainly helped the team with the design and technological guidance of the iGEM project.
Shan Lu
Adviser
As a professor of Nanjing University, the reason why I become an adviser and participate in iGEM is that the feeling of working and discussing with young students is great and fun.
Le Lv
Adviser
I am a lecturer working in the biology lab in a university for over 10 years. I enjoy working with middle school students and helping them with scientific research. I’d love to be an adviser for the CIEI-BJ team and guide the students through their experiments.
Yingkun Wang
PI
There is no shortcut for study or personal growth. With over 30 years’ experience as an educator, I have a deep feeling for the importance of practice in children’s growth. I am trying my best to provide a platform for cultivating children’s scientific literacy and I am having great fun!
Mian Xia

I am a researcher and I love the process of identifying problems, doing research and determining on the project with young students.
Students
Zheyu Guo
Member
I am Guo Zheyu, I am a student in second grade in the high school attached Hunan Normal university. In this team ,my responsibility is search information of the examination, and put it on the team’s wiki. The reason why I join IGEM is I like biology since I was a kid, my parents brought me many books about biology , since that time I am really interest in what happen in our own body, that’s the reason why I decide to participate in IGEM.
Xinyi Feng
Member
I am Xinyi Feng, a student from Beijing No.4 High School. In the team of CIEI-BJ, I am a member of the academic group, which is responsible for doing experiments and sending relative information to iGEM. I decided to participate in this competition, in that I am interested in bioengineering and I think iGEM is a good opportunity for me to learn new things.
Xinyu Cheng
Member
I’m Josie, an 11th grader in Shanghai United International School. My role in this team is to set up the wiki which displays information about our project. The way I feel about iGEM is that it’s distinctive among other competition. For me, iGEM is not only about the subject biology, but also the integration of different skills including modeling, experimental techniques, coding etc. It’s an unforgettable experience.
Zhenyu Xiong
Member
I’m Zhenyu Xiong from Sichuan Province, China, which is famous for pandas. I am a sunny boy and I am serious towards my work and study. I belong to  team CIEI-BJ and I am the leader of human practice group. My main duties are to solve all kinds of tedious problems, organize members to do HP works, do interviews and so on. I decided to participate in iGEM is because I want to have a chance to join the community full of people interested in synthetic biology and come from all over the world. What’s more, to learn and exchange our ideas.
Ao Lei
Member
I’m Ao Lei, the leader of experiment group. I have a great passion for biology, and I want to go further in this area. Being unsatisfied with learning the knowledge on textbooks, I want to explore new ideas, and IGEM gives me this opportunity, I also can meet some friends who have the same field of interest as me in IGEM. It’s attractive!
Ruyu Wang
Member
I am Ruyu Wang from Nanjing, China. In the team, I will do the experiments with my teammates, make the poster about our subject and I am responsible for our team’s PowerPoint for the report. I decided to participate in iGEM because I appreciated this valuable chance to practice my academic ability and it would be a great opportunity to work as a member of a large team.
Yuanwei He
Member
Hi this is Yuanwei. As a participants with two years experience of iGEM competition I am really keen to keep track on this excited event and put my passion on iGEM with no hesitation. I will be one of the wetlab conductors in team CIEI-BJ.
Chang Ren
Member
I am Chang Ren , and I have just finished my tenth grade in the High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China in Beijing. I am the leader of academic group which writes articles on wiki, builds up models and prepares for the final presentation, but I am also responsible for doing experiment and keeping on record. I love biology, but I am not sure about which kind of biology I will like, so I try to learn about different areas in biology and iGEM is a chance for me to find whether my interest is in synthetic biology or not. Another reason why I participate is that meeting people from other parts in the world is so much more interesting than learning myself!
Yuxin Jiang
Member
I am Yuxin Jiang, a 16-year-old student from Luhe International Academy, China. I am in charge of designing wiki, but doing parts of the experiments is also my task, which is always accompanied with writing reports and articles. I decide to participate in iGEM because of my mother. She is a doctor; an excellent one obviously. What she had done, encourages me to utilize my knowledge in doing something to make this world a better place.
Yu Zhu
Member
I’m Yu Zhu from CIEI-BJ. Actually this is my second time participate iGEM. I really like microbiology which is planed as my future major, so I join this competition again. I would like to say I really appreciate that iGEM gives me a chance approaching what I like and what I want to do. Plus, I am glad that in this team, people all from different places which give me a chance to meet different people, also most of them also are interested in biology.
Huajie Zhang
Member
My name is Zhang Huajie, and I’m a grade 10 student in Nanjing Foreign Language School. I am mainly in charge of modeling in this IGEM competition. It’s my passion and love for biology that motivated me to attend this interesting and meaningful competition. I thought this would be a perfect chance for me to combine my knowledge in math modeling and biology, as well as presenting my understanding in gene. Working with my teammates is also a wonderful experience. I enjoy sharing ideas and cooperating with them.
Haolun Cheng
Member
My name is Haolun Cheng and my nick name is Orange. I grow up in Tianjin but my hometown is actually Jiangsu province. As the photographer and designer of CIEI-BJ, this remarkable team gives me a lot of strength and it is an honor to meet and work with our team members. I participated in iGEM in order to learn some knowledge about synthetic biology as well as make friends from all over the world.
Jiangqian Xie
Member
I’m Jiangqian Xie from CIEI-BJ. I lead Human Practice section in the team. It was in the synthetic biology workshop I attended last winter that I learnt about iGEM. To learn a little theory, to apply it to edge-cutting technology, and most importantly, to help solve some tough problems in reality. iGEM perfectly combines all of them together. That’s why I join this team.
Jiayi Zhang
Member
I’m Jiayi Zhang (Sunny) , who is one of the members in lab research and human practice team. Because of my great interest in synthetic biology, I decided to participate in iGEM in order to meet more challenges. Moreover, the philosophy of iGEM is to use biological methods to solve some real life problems, which is important and helpful for teenagers like me to understand the scientific research. Making more friends is also one of my wishes during iGEM. It’s a really good opportunity for us to learn the teamwork rather than compete with each other.
Haomin Leng
Member
I am Haomin Leng. An experiment operator and a member I human practice group. At the first time, I think this competition is just about the biology and we only need some biological knowledge. However, when I participate in it deeply, I think this activity is complex--we need a lot of people who are good at computer, math, experiment or so respectively. iGEM can teach a lesson to me a lot.
