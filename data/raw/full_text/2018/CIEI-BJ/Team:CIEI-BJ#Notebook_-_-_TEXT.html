January 30th – February 10th ，2018
Our team was basically founded. The team members participated in a 12-day training on fundamental theory and basic experimental skills and started our brainstorming on the project.
May 20th ，2018     Group Meeting
We came out with some ideas about our research direction. After several rounds of discussions, we decided to build up a system to degrade aflatoxin.
May 27th ，2018   Group Meeting
We decided on the exact functions of our system and all of us began to search for background information before finalizing our summary.
July 13th -29th  ，2018
Most of  team members gathered at the University of Science & Technology Beijing for competition preparation.
July -22nd ，2018    Group Meeting
All the team members and advisors had a meeting to discuss on the focus of the project. A more detailed schedule was made.
August 26th ，2018   Group Meeting
The focus of our project was further clarified after several discussions. Each group of the team reported on their progress. And a specified time plan was agreed on.
September 2nd ，2018    Group Meeting
This time, we mainly focused on improving human practice part and pushed it forward. Our questionnaires and funding proposal were finished online.
October  3rd - 4th ，2018
All team members gathered to work on the poster, wiki and improving our presentation skill. The poster and PowerPoint slides for the final presentation was almost ready.

to yeast strain AH109 with pBKT7-ScFv2 and pBKT7-ScFv2-eYFP, separately. After transformed three days (8.24 to 8.27), we got the result of pADT7-ScFv1&pBKT7-ScFv2 and pADT7-ScFv1-BacC & pBKT7-ScFv2:
September 3rd, 2018
The yeast cells transformed with two plasmids were cultured in SD-His media with no Aflatoxin B1 (control) or 100 ug/L (100 ppb) AFT B1. According to our design, the presence of AFT B1 should facilitate the association of Gal4 AD and BD, thus driving the expression of His3 protein under the endogenous Gal1 promoter, and enabling yeast growth in SD-His media. The yeast growth (OD 600) was measured every 2 hour for 14 hours on end, and the growth curve clearly showed that, compared to control, the presence of AFT B1 significantly promoted the growth of the yeast. Therefore, the results shows the similar changes with AD-ScFv1 (BBa_K2247008) and BD-ScFv2 (BBa_K2247009). Besides this, the candidate genes which may degrade AFB1 shows very hard to growth in SD-His media. Whether these genes are really working, should be further confirmed by more experiments.
September 7th, 2018
The  eYFP is working under the AFB1 existing conditions in the yeast cells.
Western bolt to confirm the EYFP protein can be induced in the presence of AFT.
