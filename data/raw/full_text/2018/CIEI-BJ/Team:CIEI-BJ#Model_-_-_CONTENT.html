We are going to show the effect of aflatoxin by presenting diagrams of the growing situation of fungi with AFT-B1 and without AFT-B1. Such contrast would effectively reflect the difference and provide an intuitionistic visual sense.</P><P class="my-content">The following contents can be divided into three parts.</P><P class="my-content">1. Modeling of aflatoxin effect: We analyze five contrasts, including one situation with His as variable and four situations with different kinds of enzymes added.</P><P class="my-content">2. Modeling of effect as time goes: we find the difference in two situations (with AFT-B1 and without AFT-B1) as time goes.</P><P class="my-content">3. Modeling of Device: A device model is also established. This model would illustrate the variables controlled and let the users know the growing condition of those fungi.</P><DIV class="second-level" id="a3">Modeling with aflatoxin effect</DIV><P class="my-content">In this project, we analyze five contrasts, including one situation both with AFT-B1 but one with His added and one without His added, and four situations with different kinds of enzymes added. With the increase of time, the fungi would grow at a different speed. We use optical density (OD value) to reflect the growing speed of the fungi. The faster the fungi grow, the higher the OD value, since culture medium with a faster growing speed would be more turbid. Consequently, the diagram would provide a visualized contrast.</P><P class="my-content">The four enzymes we used are ADTZ, BacC, MsMeg5998 and Mnp. By recording date of these four kinds of enzymes, we could more efficiently analyze the impact of AFT-B1 on different enzymes.</P><P class="my-content">1. ScFv1&amp;ScFv2 (fungi both with AFT-B1)</P><P class="my-content">Figure 1</P><P class="my-content">As is shown in the graph, two curves show the difference when there are both AFT-B1 to be added. The blue curve represents the situation without His added, while the orange curve represents the situation with His added. It is very obvious that the fungi grow much faster without His, which means when with AFT-B1, His would inhibit the fungi to grow.</P><P class="my-content">2. ADTZ</P><P class="my-content">Figure 2</P><P class="my-content">When the enzymes added is ADTZ, the difference between fungi with AFT-B1 and fungi without AFT-B1 become less obvious.</P><P class="my-content">3.

We chose the AH109 sample.</P><P class="my-content">By subtracting the OD value of fungi without AFT-B1 from that of fungi without AFT-B1, we can observe the difference between them in different time point, in order to find out the influence of AFT-B1 on growing of fungi.</P><P class="my-content">Then we apply the data into SPSS to find the fitted curve.
