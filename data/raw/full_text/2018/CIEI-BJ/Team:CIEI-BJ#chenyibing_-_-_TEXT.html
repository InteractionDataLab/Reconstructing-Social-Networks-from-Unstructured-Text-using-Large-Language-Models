Hello
CRISPER
It's me me me me me me me me me ......
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet.
To prevent the devastating disaster brought by mosquitoes, people have come up with several basic methods to restrain the spread of pathogens. The first is to prevent the mosquitoes from entering human colonies. The second is to directly eliminate the mosquitoes either by poisonous medicines or physical ways including beat and electric shocks. The third method utilizes chemicals to disturb the mosquitoes. Mosquitoes mainly identify the hosts by detecting the CO2 released or by the amino acids that form the odor from animals or humans. Therefore, when the substance can produce smell that mosquitoes dislike, or can leak molecules that block the receptors of mosquitoes, the mosquitoes can be successfully repelled.
