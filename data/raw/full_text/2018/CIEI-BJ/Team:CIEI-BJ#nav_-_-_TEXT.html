Burdick lamp seems to be effective as the ultra violet light attracts mosquitoes, while the fact is  that carbon dioxide released by humans tempt mosquitoes better. Therefore when putting one person and one Burdick lamp into the same room, mosquitoes will simply ignore the lamp and pounce on the person, sucking as many drops of blood as they can.[8]
Mosquito Repellent Bracelet
Safety of these products worth suspicion. According to quality research, harmful substances were checked out in 37.14% of samples, seven samples contained insectifuge ester, five samples contained toluene, one sample contained benzene, toluene, xylene.[9]
Mosquito coil
A mosquito repelling incense made from a dried paste of pyrethrum powder, usually made into a spiral. A mosquito-repellent smoke can be produced through burning. Being aware of the potential for developing fire hazards, consumers have to be careful with using mosquito coils. Some studies highlight concerns when mosquito coils are used in closed rooms. Coils sold in China and Malaysia were found to produce as much smoke PM 2.5 as 75-137 burning cigarettes and formaldehyde emission levels in line with 51 burning cigarettes. [10] Moreover, smoke produced from coil combustion may cause sensory irritation of respiratory system.
Citronellol Oil
Citronella oil enjoys a widespread reputation of repelling mosquitoes. Unfortunately, one of its ingredients, methyl eugenol, has been proved that it can cause great irritation to our skin.   Concerning its doubtful safety, Canadian Ministry of Health bans citronella oil.
Floral Water
The most common repellent for mosquitoes in China must be Floral water. But this doesn’t mean that it is the safest. 75% of floral water is literally alcohol, which is combustible. In consequence, we mustn’t go into kitchen and have to keep ourselves away from cigarettes after applying floral water to our skin. Furthermore, if we overuse Floral water, it will harm our body for the ingredient DEET or BAAPE is actually poisonous.
