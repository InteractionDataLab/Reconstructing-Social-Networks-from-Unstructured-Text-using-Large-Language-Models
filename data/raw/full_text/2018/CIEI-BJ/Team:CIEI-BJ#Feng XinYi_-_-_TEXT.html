The first is to prevent the mosquitoes from entering human colonies. The second is to directly eliminate the mosquitoes either by poisonous medicines or physical ways including beat and electric shocks. The third method utilizes chemicals to disturb the mosquitoes.

released or by the amino acids that form the odor from animals or humans. Therefore, when the substance can produce smell that mosquitoes dislike, or can leak molecules that block the receptors of mosquitoes, the mosquitoes can be successfully repelled.[7]

A mosquito repelling incense made from a dried paste of pyrethrum powder, usually made into a spiral. A mosquito-repellent smoke can be produced through burning. Being aware of the potential for developing fire hazards, consumers have to be careful with using mosquito coils. Some studies highlight concerns when mosquito coils are used in closed rooms. Coils sold in China and Malaysia were found to produce as much smoke PM 2.5 as 75-137 burning cigarettes and formaldehyde emission levels in line with 51 burning cigarettes. [10] Moreover, smoke produced from coil combustion may cause sensory irritation of respiratory system.

The most common repellent for mosquitoes in China must be Floral water. But this doesn’t mean that it is the safest. 75% of floral water is literally alcohol, which is combustible. In consequence, we mustn’t go into kitchen and have to keep ourselves away from cigarettes after applying floral water to our skin. Furthermore, if we overuse Floral water, it will harm our body for the ingredient DEET or BAAPE is actually poisonous.
