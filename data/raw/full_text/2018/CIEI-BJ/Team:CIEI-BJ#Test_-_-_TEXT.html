Framework
We designed an E.coli biosensor to detect the poison in the Chinese Medicine. When E.coli detects the poison, the device will show fluorescence to quickly warn the user of the existence of poison in Chinese Medicine. Our product fulfills most of the requirements and the standards that the government set for detecting toxins/heavy metals in Chinese Medicine.  We also innovated design for eco-friendly biosafety guarantee.

Design of Biosensor Function
Our device can detect four kinds of toxins, copper, lead, arsenic, and aflatoxin. The contents of these four toxins in Chinese Medicines are limited by FDA.   If there’s any of those toxins are detected in the Chinese Medicine, the E.coli will perform fluorescence, so the user can see the result only by watching the fluorescence.

* Syringe: To let the Chinese Medicine flow into the E.coli plate.
* Filter: To remove the impurities in the Chinese Medicine
* Latch: To lock the E.coli plate in the device, so user can’t take them out again.
* Hibiscus: To prevent the leakage of E.coli from the device.
* Sodium Percarbonate: To clean all E.coli after testing.

Design of Biosafety
For the safety concern, we innovated a three-step bio-safety guarantee. First, we designed a latch that can lock the E. coli plate inside the device when they are loaded. Second, we designed a way, which is no harm to the environment, to prevent the leakage of E.coli from the device, inside of which the inner layer is covered by hibiscus. Hibiscus is a special plant which has great function of bacteria sterilization.   We also conducted experiments to verify hibiscus's function of bacteria sterilization.(Figure 5)Third, after use of this device, the user twist a button to inflow sodium percarbonate to the bacteria plate. The interaction of soidum percarbonate with any organic compounds (E. coli in our case) produces hydrogen peroxide, which diffuse into the plate and kill all E.coli. These three steps secure the users safety of use.

In this figure, we can see that hibiscus can inhibit the growth of E.coli effectively.
User Guide
Our device is sample and safe for anyone to use. Users only have to put the Chinese Medicine into the device and then wait two hours for the result. They can tell if there’s any poison in the Chinese Medicine easily by observing whether the E.coli produce fluorescence or not. Finally, users just have to twist the button to let the Sodium Percarbonate kill all the E.coli in the device without contacting any bacteria.

In conclusion, our product can efficiently detect the toxins in Chinese medicine.  This product is eco-friendly and has high quality of bio-safety.
