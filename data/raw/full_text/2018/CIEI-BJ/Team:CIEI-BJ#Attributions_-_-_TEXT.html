Overview
Our team was organized by International Teenager Competition and Communication Center (ITCCC) in January 2018, following 12 days of professional training in fundamental theory and experimental operation on molecular biology and synthetic biology.
After several months of brainstorming and conducting literature reviews, we decided we wanted to establish a detection and degrading system for aflatoxin B1. With our new detection method successfully worked, then we worked on several enzymes we thought might be able to degrade aflatoxin. However, as we reviewed the experimental result from our first two enzymes, ADTZ and BacC, we realized that our preliminary idea was unlikely to be successful. Instead, we are now aiming to develop a data library for enzymes that might be able to degrade aflatoxin. We are developing this data library by using our previous results as well as testing the function of new enzymes (e.g. F420).
Since the establishment of our team, we have received guidance from academic advisers from the University of Science and Technology Beijing and Beijing Institute of Technology. We also received lectures from Ms. Qu on genetics (e.g. on the transcription and translation from DNA to amino acid, principles of gel electrophoresis, lac and tryptophan operon, and the process of PCR).
Despite the fact that our team members study and live in different cities and provinces in China, we have embraced this challenge and used innovative solutions to help push our project forward. We convened during summer vacations and all other public holidays to work on our project. We conducted our experiments in two laboratories located in Beijing and Nanjing. Since the team members study at different schools, we have made full use of modern telecommunication technology including WeChat and QQ. Since the team’s inception, we have held telephone conferences every week to communicate on our work’s progress. We have thoroughly enjoyed this project and would like to thank all related people at CIEI-BJ and elsewhere. Without their invaluable support, this project would not have been possible.
