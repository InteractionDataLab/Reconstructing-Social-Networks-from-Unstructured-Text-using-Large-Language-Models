In the first week, several potential projects for iGEM were discussed and researched thoroughly by our team, ranging from hemoglobin, telomere to bionic technology and acceleration of banana's ripening. But concerning the practicality and safety of our project, we ultimately decided to conduct a research on mosquito repellents. Before we started, it was essential for us to be acquainted with ecophysiology of mosquitoes and public expectations of current mosquito repellents, so we distributed a questionnaire both online and offline. Moreover, we also went to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and visited several experts there to know about the latest development on repelling mosquitoes.
