Host a meet up
At the early stage of our project preparation, when we have just decided on our project’s goal, our team -- CIEI-BJ -- invited BIT-China, BFSUICC-China, USTBeijing and The Colorful Ladies together to exchange ideas and have a discussion at the University of Science and Technology Beijing. We also invited a journalist from China Science and Technology Daily to report on the event and interview some team members. As the host, we were honored to have team mentors and professional instructors point out our advantages and weaknesses.
During the meeting, we listened to the presentation by team BIT-China about “Who Can Get an A” at first. Then, BFSUICC-China shared their topic “Biological Toolkit for Lead Detection”. The Colorful Ladies showed us their project which was about the treatment of diseases related to LPL. Finally, we as the organizer talked about our project which is about detection and degradation of aflatoxin.

We have received valuable advice about the adjustment of experiment scheme, the ways of human practice at the meet  up. After the summer meet up organized by our team, we often communicated with the members of BFSUICC-China through Wechat or telephone. During our experiment, we needed to use chromatograph to measure the amount of aflatoxin. During BFSUICC-China’s experiment, they needed to use plate reader to measure fluorescent intensity and OD 600. We often discussed with each other on the Instrument usage and procedure. Mary Du often communicated with Xiaoxia Qu about part requirement, part submission, wiki editing and so on.
HP2. CIEI-BJ & BFSUICC-China Conducted Experiments in the Lab
Collaborate with UST Beijing

From July 11th to July 27th 2018, CIEI-BJ and UST Beijing performed an Interlab experiment in the laboratory of University of Science and Technology Beijing. As it was the first time for us, UST Beijing team instructed us to transfer the plasmid provided by the iGEM committee into the competent cells. We also borrowed their plate reader. Prior to the start of the experiment, CIEI-BJ deployed fluorescent agents (at the required concentration in the protocol) for both sides to perform the pre-experimental operation. In the process of experimental operation, the two teams often discussed on experimental operation steps and analyzed the problems in the experimental data. Finally, we all completed the Interlab experiment perfectly.
