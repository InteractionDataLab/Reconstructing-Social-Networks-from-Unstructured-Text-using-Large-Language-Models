Our group managed to create two new basic parts which are both an improvement of already existing basic parts. BBa_K2848003 is an ORF for the lantibiotic Pre-Nisin A from Lactococcus lactis ( BBa_K1365000 ) with two internal tags added. One is a conventional His6-Tag for easy purification via affinity chromatography. The second one is a tag of our own design, the YAAY-tag. This tag has the function to include tyrosines into nisin A which naturally has none. For our project this was of outmost importance when looking at the enzymatical linkage of nisin A to chitosan using a tyrosinase (see Experiments section).
BBa_K2848002 is the chitin deacetylase COD ( BBa_K2380044 ) with a His-tag added C-terminally. This helps to purify the expressed proteins by affinity chromatography.
