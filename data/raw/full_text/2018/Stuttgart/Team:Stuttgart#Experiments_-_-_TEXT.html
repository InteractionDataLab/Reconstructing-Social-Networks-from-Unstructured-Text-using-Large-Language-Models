Agarose gel electrophoresis
For testing which amplification was successful, agarose gel electrophoresis in horizontal chambers was used. The electrophoresis was performed using 1% TAE agarose (Agarose LE, Genaxxon) gels with ethidium bromide in 1x TAE buffer. The gel was loaded with 4 µL of the amplification product and 1x Gel Loading Dye Purple (NEB). As marker served the Quick-Load Purple 1 kb Plus DNA Ladder (NEB). The running conditions were between 4-5 V/cm. The results were documented with the DIANAII raytest DARKROOM system.
Gibson assembly
The final constructs were built using Gibson assembly. For that purpose, the amplicons of vector and inserts with their overhangs respectively were purified using Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit (NEB) following manufacturer's protocol. For Gibson assembly 10 µL Gibson Assembly Master Mix 2x (NEB) with 100 ng vector and insert(s) in 3x molar excess to vector was used. The reaction was done in a total volume of 20 µL. The mix was then incubated at 50 °C for 1 h.
Transformation
For heat shock transformation chemically competent E. coli DH5α or BL21 (DE3) were used. 5 µL of the Gibson reaction were added to 50 µL of competent cells. The mix was then incubated on ice for 30 min. Subsequently the cells were heat shocked for exactly 30 s at 42 °C and placed on ice for 5 min. The transformation mix was then resuspended in SOB medium incubated at 37 °C, 180 rpm for 1 h. The whole mix was then plated on LBCm-plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.
Cultivation
For pre-culture 2 mL LBCm medium was inoculated with single colonies and incubated at 37 °C for 20-24 h.
Mini prep
Pre-culture was used for mini prep with Monarch Plasmid Miniprep Kit (NEB) following manufacturer's protocol and concentrations were measured using NanoDrop.
Sequencing
To check successful cloning of the final constructs, 5 µL of each purified plasmid DNA with concentrations ranging from 70-100 ng/µL were sequenced with 5 µL of sequencing primers (5 µM) in a total volume of 15 µL using LightRun (GATC, Eurofins).
Primers used for sequencing:
VF2: 5'‑TGCCACCTGACGTCTAAGAA‑3'
VR: 5'‑ATTACCGCCTTTGAGTGAGC‑3'
Generation of basic BioBrick
For generation of the basic BioBrick our composite BioBrick BBa_K2848004 was source. 1 µg BBa_K2848004 was digested with 1 µL XbaI (NEB) and BbsI respectively in 1x Buffer G (both from Thermo Fisher) at 37 °C for 1 h. The digest was checked with agarose gel electrophoresis (as described above). The upper band was cut out and cleaned up with Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymogen). Afterwards 2 µL of the cleaned up fragment was ligated with 2 µL T4 DNA Ligase in 1x T4 Buffer (both NEB) in a total volume of 20 µL. The mix was incubated for 45 min at room temperature and 5 µL were transformed, plasmid-DNA purified and sequenced as described above, resulting in our basic BioBrick BBa_K2848003 .
Nisin expression
BBa_K2848004 was transformed into chemically competent E. coli DH5α. A single colony was inoculated in 2 mL LBCm and did grow for 1 h. This was used as inoculum for 200 mL SOBCm and 200 arabinose (1 g/L) was added to induce Nisin expression. This was cultivated at 37 °C and 180 rpm over night.

Protocols Linkage
Chemical linkage
The experiments for chemical linking of rhamnolipids to chitosan were conducted following protocols established by Hinner et al. 2016 [L.1] and personal communication with the first author.
All reactions are carried out at a 80 °C in ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium acetate ([EMIM]OAc) under continuous stirring.
General procedure:
Dissolve 1 % (w/v) Chitosan in [EMIM]OAc at 80 °C for 30 min
Add rhamnolipid to the chitosan and dissolve for 30 min
To start the reaction, add the divinyladipate to the mixture
Stop the reaction by adding H2O after 2 h
The product precipitated overnight at 4 °C
Afterwards, dialyze the polymer overnight against 1 L of PBS
Antimicrobial effects can be examined by antimicrobial assay
Antimicrobial assay:
Inoculate overnight cultures of E. coli, C. glutamicum, L. lactis, B. subtilis and S. cerevisiae in 5 mL appropriate medium (LB or Yeast medium).
Plate 100 µL of overnight culture on LB agar plates
Divided the plate into different areas (e.g. control, TAGC, foil, ...) and place the substances in the plate
After incubation, evaluate the growth of the microorganisms
Remove the tested surfaces and incubate the plates again
Afterwards, check the plate for growth of new colonies on previous covered spots
It was first planned to analyze the reaction product by IR spectometry. During the experiments, the IR spectometry had not proved as an appropriate method for analyzing. We were not able to identify the successful ester formation in the spectograph. Therefore, different reaction controls were investigated.
The reaction was optimized to yield the best polymer properties and antimicrobial effect. Therefore, the molecular ratios between AGU (anhydro glucose unit), divinyladipate and rhamnolipids were varied (1:1:1, 1:2:1, 1:2:2).
Enzymatic linkage
There exist diverse publications (e.g. Freddi et al. (2006) [L.2] , Chen et al. 2003 [L.3] ), describing the linkage of proteins to chitosan by tyrosinase. Hereby, the tyrosinase oxidizes tyrosine residues from the proteins. The oxidized tyrosine residues can react with the amino group of the chitosan by formation of a covalent bond.
Tyrosinase activity assay:
The tyrosinase was ordered CAS: 9002-10-2 and tested for activity by enzyme assay.
Dilute tyrosine solution in a 96-well plate to different final concentrations (2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 mM) with 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.0.
Start the reaction by adding 100 µL of tyrosinase (1 U) to the 100 µL tyrosine in the well
Measure the absorbance at 280 nm with a plate reader every minute for 30 min in total
Plot the data and calculate the reaction parameters
Linkage of GFP to chitosan:
To establish the linkage of proteins to chitosan by tyrosinase in our lab, the experiments were conducted with GFP as protein. Our antimicrobial peptide posesses no tyrosine residue in it's native form. Two different protocols were tested for linkage, according to the publications above.
Protocol 1:
Dilute chitosan stock solution 1:2 in phosphate buffer pH 6.5 and adjust pH to 6.5 with 0.5 M NaOH
Add 0.5 mL GFP (14 mg/mL) and 100 µL tyrosinase to 4 mL chitosan solution
Incubate the mixture at room temperature under continuous shaking for 3 days (open vessel for oxygen!)
Take samples at different time points (start, 24 h, 48 h, end)
Centrifuge samples and analyze supernatant by PAGE
Protocol 2:
Dilute chitosan stock solution 1:2 in phosphate buffer pH 6.0 and adjust pH to 5.8 with 0.5 M NaOH
Add 50 µL tyrosinase to 500 µL GFP and incubate for 3 days at room temperature, shaking (open vessel for oxygen!)
Afterwards, add 2 mL of chitosan solution (mentioned above) to the batch. Incubate the mixture subsequently for 3 more days
Take samples at different time points
Centrifuge samples and analyze supernatant by PAGE
GFP purification:
Defrost GFP containing E. coli filtrated cell suspension and resuspend in PBS
Disrupt cells by high-pressure homogenizer (3 cycles)
Centrifuge to separate protein containing supernatant from debris
Purificate GFP by his-tag chromatography(ÄKTA). Use TRIS buffer (50 mM, pH 7.6) was for equilibration, loading and washing steps. Bound protein can be eluted by 50 mM TRIS-buffer pH 7.6 containing 500 mM imidazole
Subsequently, dialyze the GFP containing fraction against 3 L phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.5) overnight
Determine protein concentration by nano drop
