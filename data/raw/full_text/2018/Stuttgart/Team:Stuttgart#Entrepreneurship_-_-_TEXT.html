Entrepreneurship
From the start of the iGEM competition one of our aims was to develop a commercially available product. Talks and interviews with experts in the field of surface coatings and hygiene (e.g. polymer processors, desinfectors) promised a high demand for antimicrobial surface coating. This results encouraged us to work with Campus Konzept Stuttgart e.V. to analyze our potential product and entrepreneurship helping our iGEM team to develop market entry strategies and schedules.
This resulted in two project.  The first project is the Business Model Canvas presenting the products and the company, highlighting important factors such as key partners, distribution channels, customer segments, revenue streams and many more. The second project is a Roadmap for commercialisation of TAGC after the iGEM competition. Here, the steps necessary for market entry are placed in a realistic timeframe.
