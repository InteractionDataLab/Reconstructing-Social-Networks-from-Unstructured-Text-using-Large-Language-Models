Our team
Our first meeting was during January 2018. We started as a small group of students and our advisors. We met weekly and recruited new team members and brainstormed about our project. In April 2018 our team was complete and the idea to create an anti-microbial surface was developed. Until October 2018 we tried to realize our project in the lab. In the process, we were supported by different people, companies and institutions.
General support and fundraising
We thank all the listed foundations and companies for the great support and collaboration. Without their support our project would have been impossible to realize. With donations of lab equipment and financial aid, they helped us to establish our own iGEM Lab at University of Stuttgart. Now there is a place to work for us and all future iGEM teams. Special thanks to Prof. Dr. Georg Sprenger and Dr. Josef Altenbuchner from University of Stuttgart for providing us with the laboratories premises.
Project support, lab support and advice
PI Prof. Dr. Martin Siemann-Herzberg, Jun-Prof. Dr. Björn Voss and Robert Nitschel, Sebastian Grenz, Martin Ziegler, Adrian Eilingsfeld
University of Stuttgart, Institute of Biochemical Engineering
Supervision operating day and night  as well as knowledge input and lab support were just a few things we recieved by every advisor of the Institute of Biochemical Engineering mentioned above.
Erik Eppinger
University of Stuttgart, Institute of Microbiology
Supported us by providing necessary material and solutions.
Prof. Dr. Bernhard Hauer and Dr. Lars Hinner
University of Stuttgart, Institute of Biochemistry and Technical Biochemistry
Advice, material and suggestions for TAGC development were given by Mr. Hauer and Mr. Hinner.
Prof. Dr. Oscar P. Kuipers and Dr. Auke van Heel
University of Groningen, Molecular Genetics
Mr. Kuipers and Mr. van Heel provided us with a strain of Lactoccocus lactis for our nisin production. We isolated the nisin gene cluster out of this strain.

Karlsruher Institut für Technologie, Institut für Bio- und Lebensmitteltechnik 2
Advice and contacts to get a plasmid with rhlC
Prof. Dr. Lars Blank and Dr. Andrea Germer
Rheinisch Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen, Angewandte Mikrobiologie
Provision of plasmid pVLT33 containing rhlC, scientific support in project planning phase
iGEM Team Darmstadt
iGEM Team Darmstadt sent us seven biobricks for chitosan production. Furthermore, they supported us with advice and useful hints.
iGEM Team Marburg
We collaborated with iGEM Team Marburg by doing experiments/measurements for their project (see Collaboration ).
Technical support
Prof. Dr. Jürgen Pleiss
University of Stuttgart, Bioinformatics
Our Modeling part was supervised by Mr. Pleiss. He supported us with advice and computing power.
Dr. Birgit Claasen
University of Stuttgart, Organic Chemistry
Mrs. Claasen and her colleagues conducted infrared analysis of our samples.
Prof. Dr. Christian Bonten and colleagues
University of Stuttgart, Plastics Engineering
He and his team analysed TAGC by Differential Scanning Calorimetrie (DSC). Above all, he gave us advice and further ideas for developing TAGC (see Human Practices ).
Human practices support
Prof. Dr. Matthias Orth
Department of Microbiology, Marienhospital
We had an interesting talk about hygiene and disinfection in hospitals with Mr. Orth. He gave us information about the requirements for antimicrobial surfaces.
Departments of public relations and hygiene
Katharinenhospital
The Katharinenhospital gave us information about hygiene standards in hospitals.
Michael Teutsch
German Red Cross Calw
We visited Mr. Teutsch at the ambulance station and interviewed him about cleaning and disinfection in ambulances. Moreover, we learned about the regulatory requirements of a surface coating.
Business consulting
Katharina Schütz and Jens Lohmann
Campus Konzept Stuttgart e.V. (see campus-konzept.de )
Katharina and Jens helped us to develop a business concept.
Thanks and acknowledgements
Finally, we would like to thank all contributors working for the project.
