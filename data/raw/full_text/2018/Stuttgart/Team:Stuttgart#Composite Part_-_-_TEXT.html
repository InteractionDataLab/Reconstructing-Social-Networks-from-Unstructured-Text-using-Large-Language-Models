BBa_K2848001 is a combination of chitin synthase NodC and chitin deacetylase COD to produce chitosan in E. coli. The part was created based on BBa_K2380002 (NodC created by Team Darmstadt 2017) by inserting our improved version of the COD, BBa_K2848001 . A particular property of this composite part is that both coding regions are under the control of promoters which are induced by different molecules. The NodC is controlled by an arabinose inducible promoter and the COD is controlled by an IPTG incucible T7 promoter. This allows sequential expression of the two proteins which might be advantegeous since the final product, a chitosan-pentamer, has antimicrobial effects.
The second composite part we created during this years iGEM project, BBa_K2848004 , is an improved version of BBa_K1365000 initially created by Team Groningen 2014. We added an arabinose inducible promoter system and an RBS to obtain a controllable translational unit. Additionally, as already mentioned in the basic parts section , we added a His- and our YAAY-tag internally. The His-tag enables fast purification of the protein by affinity chromatography. Our YAAY-tag offers a linkage site for tyrosinase based linkage.
