Introduction
1. Inflammatory bowel disease
Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic inflammatory disease that                         affects the gastrointestinal tract. It has two major clinically defined forms, one is Crohn's                         disease that can affect any parts of the gastrointestinal tract, and the other is ulcerative                         colitis that affects the colonic mucosa [1]. Although the pathophysiology of IBD is largely                         unknown, some factors that have a major role motivating of IBD have been identified, including                         genetic factors, the host's immune system, and environmental factors [2]. Patients with IBD often have symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in the stool, and weight loss                         during disease activity [3], which decrease the life quality of patients dramatically.                         Unfortunately, IBD is not curable and IBD patients have a higher risk of developing colorectal                         cancer [1].
2. War inside the intestine
In general, when the immune system overreacts to the flora normally                         resident in the gut, it causes a series of inflammatory events that may damage and destroy the                         intestinal wall [4]. Some biomolecules are released by bacteria which induce an inflammatory                         reaction to intestinal epithelial cells, causing the destroyed tight junction between                         intestinal epithelial cells and the reduced of mucus layer thickness . When dendritic cells in                         the lamina propria sense these biomolecules, they release inflammatory signals to recruit                         immune cells, which exacerbates the inflammatory response. Microorganisms in the intestinal                         lumen pass through the leaky intestinal epithelial barrier, which further exacerbates the                         immune response against bacteria and creates a vicious circle. These immunological attacks and                         inflammatory injuries eventually lead to the death of intestinal epithelial cells [5]. IBD                         occurs when this condition persists without intervention.
3. A growing global disease
IBD is a global disease that is most common in North America,                         Western Europe, Northern Europe, Australia, and New Zealand [6, 7], which may be related to the                         higher level of industrialization in these regions [8]. There are more than 1 million IBD                         patients in the United States [9], and the medical burden associated with IBD directly exceeds                         $6 billion per year [10]. In Canada, more than 200,000 people have IBD, and the annual medical                         burden exceeds CDN$1.2 billion [11]. In Europe, there are more than 2.5 million IBD patients                         with an annual health care burden of more than €4.6 billion [12]. Due to the growing number of                         cases, huge medical expenses, the loss of work capacity of the sick and the aging of the sick                         population, IBD will place a heavy burden on the world in the next decade [7, 13].
4. Rising in the Asia
In the past few decades, IBD has shown a growing trend in low-incidence areas, especially in new                         industrialized areas such as Asia [14, 15]. This is likely to be related to the Westernization                         of residents' dietary patterns and the rapid urbanization process [16, 17].
Asia is one of the continents that experiencing fastest urbanization in the world [18], and                         there is a close relationship between urbanization and IBD [19]. In Asia, the high incidence of                         IBD is mainly found in some highly urbanized areas, such as Hong Kong, Macau and Guangzhou,                         while residents and rural residents in some less industrialized areas show lower morbidity                         [14]. People who flood into cities have access to better health care and sanitation, but the                         abuse of antibiotics and overly hygienic habits can interfere with normal gut flora [5, 20]. In                         addition, due to the poor quality of air condition, heavy mental stress, a more sedentary                         lifestyle and consumption of high-fat foods, people who live in a developed city are more                         likely to get IBD [5, 20]. At present, the incidence of IBD in Asia is rising rapidly. In Hong                         Kong, for example, the number of cases increased by 30 times from 1985 to 2014 [21], and the                         gastroenterology ward was crowded with young IBD patients [20].
Western diets are broadly defined as containing high amounts of saturated fat, red meat, sugar                         and low amounts of fruit, vegetables, grains, seafood, poultry meat [17]. Studies have                         confirmed the association between Western diet and the pathogenesis of IBD [22, 23]. In                         addition, immigration studies showed that people move from developing countries to developed                         countries and adopt to Western lifestyles are more likely to suffer from IBD.
In the long run, the incidence of IBD in Asia will soon be similar to Europe and America [20].                         To make matters worse, compared with European and American countries, the efforts of Asian                         countries to cope with the medical and economic burden of IBD are seriously inadequate [20]. In                         addition, many patients who have been sick for a long time are unaware of the fact that they                         have IBD, which leads to underdiagnosis of IBD [20].
5. Current therapies
The treatment of IBD is very complicated. Traditionally, IBD has been treated with Step up                         therapy, which starts at a certain level depending on the severity of the disease, and                         gradually escalates the therapy when the lower-level therapy fails [25]. The order from low to                         high is as follows: aminosalicylic acid preparation (aspirin) → glucocorticoid →                         immunosuppressant (azathioprine) →biological agents (anti-TNF) → surgery [26]. This routine                         step up treatment is not suitable for patients at risk of rapid disease progression and may delay optimal medication time and increase the risk of hospitalization and surgery. The use of                         top down therapy, that is, the preferential use of anti-TNF monoclonal antibody than the step                         up strategy can more effectively induce and maintain remission and change the disease process                         [25].
Surgical treatment is often seen as a last resort, but as the understanding of the disease                         continues to deepen, it has been found that some patients with early-stage IBD have a better                         quality of life than patients who administrate biological agents [27]. This provides us with a                         new top down therapy that prioritizes the use of surgery. But for patients with complex IBD,                         surgical treatment can easily lead to disability and a significant decline in quality of life.
There are pros and cons to specific drug treatments. Non-specific anti-inflammatory drugs are                         inexpensive, and immunosuppressive agents are effective, which can reduce the need for surgery                         and hospitalization in patients with IBD, and reduce the risk of clinical recurrence and                         glucocorticoid dependence in patients with IBD [28]. However, non-specific anti-inflammatory                         drugs are prone to tolerance and fail. Biologics are currently the most effective drugs, but                         they are expensive and difficult for ordinary people to bear. For example, in the United                         States, 75 kg of IBD patients are treated with a standard dose of infliximab, which costs about                         $26,700 per year, while a year of azathioprine (a biologic immunosuppressive agents) costs only                         $750 per year [28]. Therefore, immunosuppressive agents are a reasonable and cost-effective                         treatment strategy for patients with IBD and still have value in use [28]. In addition,                         clinical studies have found that anti-TNF biologics combined with steroid immunosuppressive                         agents have better efficacy than monotherapy. At the same time, the risk of solid tumors and                         serious infections increases [29]. In short, IBD patients need tailored personalized treatment                         options.
The recent emergence of Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) provides a new option for the                         treatment for IBD. FMT is referred as transplanting the flora of healthy human feces into the                         intestine of a patient, rebuilding the normal intestinal flora, and achieving the purpose of                         treating diseases inside and outside the intestine. However, FMT itself has a difficult choice                         of donors, long-term safety is not clear, patients with low acceptance and poor efficacy, thus,                         the efficacy of FMT for IBD is limited [30].
6. Our solution
This year, our team NEU_China_A try to use engineered bacteria to                         explore an inexpensive, safe and efficient way to deal with the dilemma in the intestinal tract                         of patients with IBD. See project design for details.
