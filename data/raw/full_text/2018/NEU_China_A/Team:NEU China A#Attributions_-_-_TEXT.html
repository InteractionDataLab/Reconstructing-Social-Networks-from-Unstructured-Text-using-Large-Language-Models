Thank you all for helping us in the past amazing year! We can't succeed without your help!
Special thanks to 2016 iGEM Team ShanghaiTechChina_B, part of our project is based on their work.
General Support
Professor Chen Ding guided our project and lended his lab to us.
Lab support
As advisor, Yanjian L, Xindi Gao, Qiaojing Liang, Hailong Li guided our experiments and helped us do some of the work.
Fundraising
Teacher Hongqiang Qi raised funds for our project.
Project organization
Zhaoyu Liu designed our project and organized weekly meeting.
Wet lab
Zhaoyu Liu and Guowei Song participated in the plasmid construction and characterization of NO sensor.
Jiali Wang, Jiangxue Li and Yining Zheng participated in the construction and expression of the myrosinase plasmid.
Jiali Wang and Jiangxue Li constructed plasmid of killswitch. Jiali Wang, Jiangxue Li and Lengning Wei performed experiments related to kill switch.
Yuening Xiang, Jiyuan Teng and Lengning Wei participated in the plasmid construction of IL10. Hongfa Yan and Lengning Wei participated in the expression of IL10.
Yanjian Li, Qiaojing Liang, Zhaoyu Liu participated the plasmid construction and characterization of YebF-GFP.
Art
Weilin Jiang and Zekun Li produced the logo of the team and many pictures related to our projects. A sketch of the project design was drawn by Yuening Xiang.
Presentation
Jiali Wang, Jiangxue Li, Lengning Wei and Zhaoyu Liu made made the defense PPT for Giant Jamboree.
Poster
Zhaoyu Liu produced the poster for CCiC. Weilin Jiang and Jiangxue Li produced the poster for Giant Jamboree.
Interlab
Guowei Song organized the experiment and participated in the experiment with Yuening Xiang and Hongfa Yan.
DNA submits
Yuening Xiang and Jiyuan Teng collected our parts and sent them to Nanjing.
Mobile game
Zhaoyu Liu and Hongfa Yan designed the game, and Yueyang Wu made the game.
Modelling
Zaixing Huang proposed the original idea of amplifier modeling and discussed it with Xiaowei Wang and Jiyuan Teng. Rongye Meng modeled our amplifier and wrote Chinese materials. Zhaoyu Liu is responsible for translation and typesetting. Xiaowei Wang is responsible for uploading materials.
Wiki
Xianli Fang and Mingyang Zhang designed web pages and uploaded materials.
Zhaoyu Liu, Jiali Wang, Lengning Wei, Guowei Song, Jiangxue Li, Jiani Li, and Rui Wang participated in the writing of the wiki.The adviser Wei Du helped us to modify the text of our wiki.
Human practices
Rui Wang, Jiani Li and Jiangxue Li are responsible for organizing and participating in HP's activities. Zhaoyu Liu, Jiali Wang, Guowei Song, Yuening Xiang, and Zaixing Huang participated in some of HP's activities. Zhaoyu Liu and Guowei Song participated in the 5th CCiC organized by Shanghaitech University. Jiali Wang, Guowei Song and Zhaoyu Liu participated in the cooperation with other teams.
