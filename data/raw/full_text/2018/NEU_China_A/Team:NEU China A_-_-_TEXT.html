NEU-China-A
Overview
The goal of NEU_China_A this year is to design a biological system aiming to alleviate intestinal inflammatory         diseases and prevent potential colorectal cancer. We chose E. coli Nissle 1917 as our chassis, a probiotic that         is safe for humans. On the one hand, when it senses an inflammatory signal in the intestine, it releases an         anti-inflammatory drug (interleukin-10) to put out the fire in the intestines. On the other hand, it can         release myrosinase to convert the glucosinolate contained in cruciferous vegetables into sulforaphane. The         sulforaphane can both alleviate inflammation in the intestine and prevent colorectal cancer induced by chronic         inflammation.
Intestinal homeostasis
There are a lot of microorganisms living in the intestines. The intestinal villi and the underlying                 tissueshave                 the largest immune cell population in the human body. Harmonious coexistence between the                 intestinalflora and                 the immune cells is critical to human health. Consequently, the intestine has evolved                 severalmechanisms.
In the crypt, the goblet cells secrete mucus covering the surface of the intestinal villi and                         Paneth cells                         secrete antibacterial peptides to inhibit bacterial invasion. In addition, the basal stem cells                         continue to                         proliferate and differentiate to renew the intestinal epithelium.
Peyer’s patch contains a large amount of lymphoid tissues, which is the key to regulating the                         immune                         system's response to pathogens, and is tolerant to harmless microorganisms and food. Dendritic                         cells in the                         Peyer’s patch can extend dendrites among epithelial cells, collecting antigen and decomposing                         it, by which                         to activate the tolerability of lymphoid cells.
Regulatory T cells secrete IL-10 in the lamina propria, inhibit the immune cells of the lamina                         propria and                         epithelial layers, preventing vigorous immunoreaction along with unnecessary inflammation. Once                         the                         imbalance of homeostasis in the immune system occurs, it can cause intestinal disease. When                         this condition                         persists without intervention, it can lead to inflammatory bowel disease.
