NEU CHINA A
We are team NEU China A.
Since the preparation, 19 undergraduates have joined our team. The team members come from college of life science, college of computer science, school of software, etc. Fortunately, our team also has two instructors and five advisers. During the preparation of the competition for nearly a year, we had a clear division of labor and helped each other. Thanks to iGEM for bringing us together.

846625169@qq.com Bioengineering Senior As a member of NEU_China_A, I have gained lots of experience on scientific researches and learned much knowledge about synthetic biology. As for our project, we choose E. coli as host strains, using genetic engineering and synthetic biology methods to express IL-10 with anti-inflammatory activity and myrosinase with anti-cancer activity. To achieve sensitive detection of inflammatory signals, a kind of promoter called pNorV is made to measure NO molecules in human intestines. The pharmacological activities of these functional proteins were finally tested by experiments with cell lines. In order to improve the efficiency, our team is divided into several groups to do experiments at the same time. I mainly participate in the work of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10. In addition, I was involved in mathematical modeling and plasmid construction. From the initial discussion about the project topic to weekly meetings, experiments, human practice and other aspects of the project, we all worked together. I deeply realized the importance of teamwork from this valuable experience.

liuzhaoyu.neu@qq.com Bioengineering Senior There are many confusions in our life, sometimes we can get help from others, sometimes we can only solve it by ourselves. For some problems, we may not get an answer during the rest of our life. For some difficulties, we just overcome it like iGEMers.
