COMPOSITE PARTS
In our project we tried to repurpose a peptide communication machinery from a phage of the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis to the cells of Gram-negative Escherichia coli, and quickly discovered that crossing the inter-species barrier in bioengineering is a challenging task. This Part Collection consists of a series of promoter variants designed to debug the mechanism of transcriptional regulation in the pAimX promoter that is key to the signalling system. The Collection helped us successfully identify an internal terminator, investigate a potential anti-termination mechanism, and build a hybrid promoter that converts the native transcriptional activator (AimR) into a transcriptional repressor.

When placed upstream of a reporter gene, promoters from this Part Collection showed variable transcription strengths and degrees of regulation that provided valuable insights for our project and facilitated the porting of the peptide communication machinery from B. subtilis to E. coli.
To build this Part Collection the BBa_K2675080 and BBa_K2675081 were a key tool.
