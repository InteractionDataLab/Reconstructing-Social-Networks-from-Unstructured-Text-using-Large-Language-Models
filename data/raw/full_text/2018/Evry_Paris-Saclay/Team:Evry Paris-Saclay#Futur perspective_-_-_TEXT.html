FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Our PEPTalk system tends to be a complete inter-bacterial communication system but can nevertheless open up to a number of improvements and adaptations. During the development of our project, we focused on a lot of ways to optimise and expand our project.
Following the advice of professionals and after looking back to our project we were interested in how to extend our possibilities concerning the use of peptide receptor pairs. In fact, instead of only using a peptide / receptor / promoter pair, we have imagined that it would be better to generate a large variety of these pairs. Thanks to this, we would be able to direct our communication between a single set of bacteria as well as between several subsets. By following this strategy we could generate a very large number of peptides (up to tens of millions) because with 20 proteinogenic amino acids, the amount of possible combinations to form a hexapeptide is greater.
In the same way, concerning the peptide / receptor / promoter pairs, we also imagined that we could create an artificial selection of our peptides with a directed evolution of our receptors and promoters. As a result, we could significantly increase the handling possibilities of the system.
Regarding the potential applications where we could directly apply our PEPTalk system:
We could in the future think to integrate communicating systems (via our peptides) wich will interact with each other thanks to logic Gates. This point could be quite interesting because we could use these logic gates in a large field of applications.
Another application for our system would be the stabilization of co cultures, this point could be quite interesting because The PEPTalk communication system will provide a possible quorum sensing between all our species of bacteria. This would be possible because our communication system will be exclusive to all the different species of bacteria. They will therefore communicate with each other as if they were part of the same species.
