All basic parts were created via standard cloning techniques and methods are described <a href=" https://2018.igem.org/Team:Goettingen/Experiments " target="_blank">here</a>. The composite parts were constructed, using the 3A-assembly, which is also described <a href=" https://2018.igem.org/Team:Goettingen/Experiments " target="_blank">here</a>. The following table gives an overview about our parts.
