In the morning: Inoculation of 4 ml LB with BP270 containing pAC7::PyciAB-xylR and BP270 containing the empty BP270.
In the evening: Inoculation of 4 ml CS-Glc medium with 100 µL of the first culture from the morning. Incubation: shaking over night at 37°C.

10 ml C minimal medium containing different glyphosate concentrations (0mM, 0.5 mM and 1 mM) were inoculated with the two strains in a 100 ml shake flasks to an OD600 of about 0.1. They were grown until they reached an OD600 of 0.5-0.8
