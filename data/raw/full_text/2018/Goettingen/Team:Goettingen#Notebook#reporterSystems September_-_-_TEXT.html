The reaction was inactivated for 5 min at 80°C. Afterwards 1 μL fast AP was added and the reaction was then incubated for 10 min at 37°C. The sample was purified with the DNA purification kit and eluted in 32 μL water. The framgemts were ligated with pAC7 and a religation was performed along side the ligation reaction.

Lane 1 to 3: PyciAB-xylR clone 1 to 3, lane 4 to 6 PyciC-xylR clone 1 to 3.
The colones 1 and 3 of PyciAB-xylR and clone 3 of :PyciC-xylR were send away for sequnecing. Clone 3 of :PyciAB-xylR came back positiv.
24.09.18
The strain BP270 was made competent. Next, the competent cells were transformed with pAC7 containing PyciAB-xylR isolated from clone 3. In a second reaction BP270 cells were transformed using only the empty pAC7 vector
24.09.18
6 colonies of each transformation were streaked out on agar plates to gain single colonies.
25.09.18
To test whether the correct integartion of the construct was successfull, the α amylase-activity was determined using starch agar plates. Here we determined that all picked clones of the transformation using only the empty plasmid were correct while only one of the 6 picked clones was correct for the transformation with the whole construct. The correct clone was used for further experiments.
