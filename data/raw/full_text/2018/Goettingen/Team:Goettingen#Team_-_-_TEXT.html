We are especially grateful to our numerous sponsors on gofundme,  who supported our project and made it possible.
Every public donor, who helped us to achieve our goals got a special place on our bacterial wall of fame and a handdrawn microbe to show our appreciation. A link to that wall can be found here:

Favourite method:
Protein purification
Janek Meißner
Age:
21
Favourite subject:
Microbiology
Character:
Open-minded, gentle giant, optimist
Why iGEM:
IGEM brings together young international students that work on current research topics. What makes it so great is the opportunity to plan and conduct your own project from scratch. This is the perfect preparation for the future life as a scientist. I like it as it is a challenge with a promising result, able to influence the whole world.
Future perspective:
Acquire a PhD in microbiology or molecular genetics
Favourite microbe:
Methanogenic Archea like Methanococcus
Favourite method:
Plasmid preparation
Malte Holmer
Age:
23
Favourite subject:
Physical chemistry, theoretical biology
Character:
Nerdy, enthusiastic
Why iGEM:
In my future I’d like to get involved in bioinformatics, as I love to work with everything tech related. Therefore being the “IT”-guy in the team was a good challenge to push my limits in the area of bits, bytes and information technology.
Future perspective:
Ph. D. in Bioinformatics (aka hackerman)
Favourite microbe:
Phages (technically not living, but what’s not to love virus, the most abundant "organisms" on earth)
Favourite method:
Javascript (jk)
