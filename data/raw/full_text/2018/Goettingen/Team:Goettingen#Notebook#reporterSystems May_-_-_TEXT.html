Identification of upregulated proteins in presence of glyphosate in Bacillus subtilis
07.05.18
The two B. subtilis strains 168 and the tryptophan prototroph strain SP1 were grown at different glyphosate concentrations. To identify upregulated protein expression in the presence of glyphosate.
For cultivation, the two strains were inoculated in 4 mL LB medium and incubated overnight at 37°C (200 rpm) The overnight cultures were transferred into 4 mL fresh LB medium and grown for 2 h at 28°C (200 rpm).

Proteins were isolated from cultures by lysing the cells with 50 µL lysis buffer and a Bradford assay was carried out to determine the protein concentration.
Materials for the Bradford assay:

buffer from protein elution
Procedure:
Prespare for each portein mixture 3 samples with different concentrations.

After mixing the samples with the protein solutions, the mixtures have to be incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. Transfer the mixtures and the reference sample to 1.5 mL cuvettes and measure the absorption at a wavelength of 595 nm.
Calculate the amount of protein in your sample using the following formula:

The procedure
Clean the glass plates, combs and mats with ethanol and assemble the glass plate sandwich. Be sure that the plates are well aligned. Place the plates in the casting frame and tighten them. Place the casting frames into the casting stands.
Wear gloves for making the gels because acrylamide is a neurotoxin in its unpolymerized form!!! Running gel for denaturing SDS PAGE (enough for 2 gels).

TEMED 10 µl
Mix the ingredients of the running gel and pour the solution quickly (gel starts to polymerize once TEMED has been added) into the gap between the glass plates. Leave enough room for the stacking gel – appr. 1 cm below the bottom of the comb´s teeth. After a minute you can overlay the solution with iso-propanol or ethanol. This excludes the access of oxygen and plane the surface
After polymerization, pour off the iso-propanol and rinse with distilled water. Mix the reagents for the stacking gel and pour it on top of the running gel till the space is completely full. Then insert the comb. No alcohol overlay is needed due to the comb.
After polymerization clamp the gel into the electrophoresis apparatus and fill it with running buffer. Remove the comb carefully and use a pipette or syringe to wash the wells with running buffer.
The protein samples (up to 15 µl) are mixed with SDS loading buffer (2.5 µl) and incubated for 10 min at 95°C.
After heating briefly centrifuge the samples to spin down the condensed water.
Then you can apply the samples on a SDS PAGE with a pipette or Hamilton microliter syringe. Do not forget to add molecular weight marker in one lane.
Run the gel at 80 V until the front has moved into the running gel. Then you can increase the voltage to 120 V. Run the gel until the running front has reached the bottom of the running gel.
Pry the plates apart by using a gel spacer. The gel can then be stained (Coomassie staining, method 56 or Silver staining, method 57) to visualize the separated proteins or processed further (Western Blotting, method 58).

Plasmid amplification and cloning experiments for reporter constructs
18.05.18
To produce a reporter system, we needed to identify promoters from genes that are induced upon glyphosate treatment. Our hypothesis is that the promoter of trpE and trpP are induced by glyphosate, as described in the design section (TO DO, link hier einfügen!!!). Therefore, PtrpE as well as two variants of the EPSP-synthase (encoded by aroE were amplified by PCR using primers iGEM2018_25/26 and iGEM2018_27/28, respectively.

Preparation of competent E. coli strains DH5α and XL1-Blue
The preparation was carried out over the following days.
The Material
TB buffer (ice-cold)
liquid LB medium
SOB medium
1 M MgCl2
1 M MgSO4
DMSO (100%)
The Procedure
Inoculate 20 mL LB medium either with a single colony or from a cryo stock of the desired E. coli strain and incubate the culture with agitation for 20 h at 28°C.
Inoculate 250 mL SOB medium supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM MgSO4 in a 2 L shake flask and grow the cells to an OD600 of 0.5–0.9 (20–24 h) at 18°C and 200–250 rpm.
Incubate the whole flask for 10 min on ice. Collect the cells by centrifugation for 10 min at 4°C and 5,000 rpm. Re-suspend the cell in 80 mL of ice-cold TB buffer and incubate them for 10 min on ice. Collect the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 5,000 rpm.
Re-suspend the cells in 20 mL of ice-cold TB buffer. Add DMSO to a final concentration of 7% (1.4 mL) by gently shaking the falcon tube.
Transfer 0.2 mL aliquots into labelled Eppendorf reaction tubes and freeze the cells in liquid nitrogen. Store the cells at -80°C. The volume of the pre-culture strongly depends on the E. coli strain. Using DH5α, it is recommended to use 4 mL pre-culture and inoculate at 8 a.m. Nex day around 10 a.m. this strain should have reached an OD600 between 0.5 and 0.6. If you use the strain XL1-Blue, you will need less cells and it is sufficient to inoculate the SOB medium around lunchtime.

Inoculation of transformed strains
28.05.18
4 mL LB medium were supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics and inoculated with the transformed strains (25.05.18). The cultures were incubated over night with agitation at 37°C.
Preparation of the plasmids for further work
29.05.18
The isolation of the plasmids was performed with the NucleoSpin® kit from Macherey and Nagel.
The Material
Liquid LB medium
NucleoSpin® plasmid kit
The Procedure
Use single colonies from your transformation plates to inoculate 4 mL (15–20 mL for low-copy plasmids) liquid LB medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic and grow the culture overnight at 37°C with agitation.
Collect the cells from 1.5 mL (15 mL for low-copy plasmids) of the overnight cultures by centrifugation (1 min, 13,000 rpm). Re-suspend the pellet in 250 mL of buffer A1, add 250 mL of buffer A2, mix gently 6–8 times and incubate the suspension for 5 min at room temperature. For the isolation of low-copy plasmids add 500 mL of buffers A1 and A2 to the cells.
Add 300 mL (0.6 mL for low-copy plasmids) of buffer A3, mix gently 6–8 times and centrifuge the lysate for 5–10 min at 13,000 rpm.
Transfer the supernatant into NucleoSpin® plasmid column, centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard the flow-through.
OPTIONAL: For sequencing of low-copy plasmid DNA add 500 mL buffer AW to the column, centrifuge for 1 min at 13000 rpm and discard the flow-through.
Add 600 mL of buffer A4, centrifuge (1 min, 13,000 rpm) and discard the flow-through.
To dry the silica membrane, centrifuge again for 2 min at 13,000 rpm.
Add 50 mL of sterile and deionized water on top of the silica membrane of the column incubate the column for 1–5 min at room temperature and elute the DNA by centrifugation for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
The plasmid DNA is highly pure and can be stored at -20°C.
The concentration of the isolated plasmids was determined with the Nanodrop device.

Competent E. coli cells from the strain DH5α were transformed with the ligation samples. Also, a negative controll without DNA was prepared, were the cells received only water. The transformed cells were plated on LB medium agar containing ampicillin and X-Gal in the following manner: on one plate 50 µL and on the second palte 100 µL. The cell were incubated over night at 37°C.
