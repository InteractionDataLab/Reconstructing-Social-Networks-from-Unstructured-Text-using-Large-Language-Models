Again transformations

Transformation of pIGEM2, pIGEM2, pIGEM3, and pIGEM5 into E. coli DH5α to geht backup plasmids.
Transformation of SP1 with pIGEM5.
Evaluation of transformations
03.07.18
DH5α transformants were separated. SP1-pIGEM2/3 transformants were also separated. The strain SP1 was transformed with pBQ200 to create an isogenic control. For this transformation, we used 2 µL plasmid. The following table shows the results from the transformations.

Plasmid preparation and preparation of "modified disc assay"
04.07.18
The plasmid pIGEM5 was isolated from E. coli with the normal protocol. Concentration: 141.4 ng/µL.
A PCR was performed with the primers ML107 and lacZ-rev on the plasmid to check if there is an insert. This PCR was succesful.
The transformations of SP1 with pBQ200 were separated.
CS-Glu agar with and w/o tryptophan were prepared. In the middle of the plate was a circle of the agar extracted with an open falcon tube. The precultures for this experiment (SP1_pIGEM3) were incubated over night in LB medium at 28°C and agitation.
Furthermore was the β-galactosidase assay prepared for the next day with the strains:

Modified disc assay
Cells from the over night culture were propagated on CS-Glu agar containing X-Gal, kanamycin and NO tryptophan. Into the holes in the plates, we filled 400 µL CS-Glu medium and 400 µL CS-Glu medium with 50 mM glyphosate. The plates were incubated over night at 37°C.
The transformation of SP1 with pIGEM5 was repeated.
Preparation of β-galactosidase assay
The strains iGEM20 and SP1_pIGEM3 were used. Some colonies were picked from the plates and resuspended in 50 µL LB medium. 5 µL were transferred into 4 mL LB medium and the remaining 45 µL were also transferred into 4 mL LB medium. The cells were incubated over daytime and then was CS-Glu medium (5 mL) inoculated with the following pattern.

The cells were harvested with the following protocol:

4.5 mL iGEM20 with glyphosate was centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 rpm and 4°C.
09.07.18
Transformation of SP1 with pIGEM5 was performed like in protocol described.
Precultures of strain iGEM21 in 5 mL CS-Glu w/o tryptophan and strain iGEM3 in 5 mL CS-Glu w/o tryptophan were prepared and incubated over night at 37°C with agitation.
β–galactosidase assay
10.07.18
For the β-galactosidase assay, SP1_pIGEM3 and GP342 were transferred into 4 mL LB medium and incubated over night.
For the modified disc assay, 4 mL LB medium were inoculated with SP1_pIGEM3.
Primers for all biobricks were designed.
