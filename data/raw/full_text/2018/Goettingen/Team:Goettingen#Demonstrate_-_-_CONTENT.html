Hence, we purchased the product Roundup<SUP>®</SUP> from our local home improvement store. It has to be considered, that even though glyphosate is the active ingredient in Roundup<SUP>®</SUP>, it contains additional substances (actually it is a soap to facilitate the contact between glyphosate and the plant surface) that could pose negative side effects.
                In a first trial phase, we wanted to investigate if Roundup<SUP>®</SUP> affects our modified <I>B. subtilis</I> strains in a similar way as pure glyphosate (see Figure 1).</P><DIV class="article_picture"><P>Figure 1. Growth of the <EM>B. subtilis</EM> wild type strain 168 with increasing amounts of the herbicidal mixture Roundup<SUP>®</SUP>. The optical density was measured at a wavelength of λ=600 nm.</P></DIV><P>As shown in Figure 1, growth of <EM>B. subtilis</EM> was severely inhibited in the presence of low amounts of Roundup<SUP>®</SUP> as it was the case with pure glyphosate!</P><P>
                Furthermore, we repeated our competition experiments with Roundup<SUP>®</SUP> and compared it to our previous results (see Figure 2). The signals from GFP and mOrange fit with the experiments where pure glyphosate was used.
            </P><DIV class="article_picture"><P>Figure 2. The effect of Roundup<SUP>®</SUP> on the competition assay that we have performed previously. GFP was excited at λ=488 nm and emission was measured at 509 nm. mOrange was excited at λ=529 nm, emission was recorded at λ=562 nm. (A)  Fluorescence of GFP. With increasing amounts of Roundup<SUP>®</SUP>, the fluorescence of GFP decreases. (B)  Fluorescence of mOrange. With increasing amounts of Roundup<SUP>®</SUP>, the fluorescence increases.</P></DIV><P>As we created a glyphosate detection system, we wanted to test our competition assay with a &quot;sample&quot; (Figure 3). The &quot;sample&quot; had a concentration of 0.6 mM.</P><DIV class="article_picture"><P>Figure 3. The competition assay is a 1:1 mixture of strains iGEM23 and iGEM36. Both strains were cultivated in CS-Glc minimal medium with increasing glyphosate concentrations (0–2 mM). The fluorophore GFP was excited at λ=488 nm, the emission was recorded at λ=509 nm. mOrange was excited at λ=529 nm, the emission was measured at  λ=562 nm.A. Fluorescence of GFP, intensity decreases with higher glyphosate concentrations. The sample fits between 0.5 and 0.75 mM.B. Fluorescence of mOrange, intensity increases with higher glyphosate concentration.</P></DIV><P>This results enable us to detect the amount of glyphosate in a sample highly accurate.</P><P>These results show that our detection method works perfectly with the commercially available product Roundup<SUP>®</SUP>!</P><P>The overall aim of our project was to develop a procedure that allows to determine if a sample is contaminated with glyphosate. Consequently, we analyzed soil samples that were previously treated with Roundup<SUP>®</SUP>. Our product is based on the intraspecies competition of a sensitive strain constitutively expressing the <EM>lacZ</EM> gene encoding the β–galactosidase and a non-labelled glyphosate-resistant strain. The principle of our product is depicted in Figure 4.</P><DIV class="article_picture"><P>Figure 4. Workflow describing the detection of glyphosate by intraspecies competition. Glyphosate is extracted from the soil using water. The solution is applied to the vial containing a bacterial cell suspension using the <A href="https://www.sartoriusglobal.com/_ui/images/h21/he8/8882176589854.pdf">Claristep® Filtration System.</A> After incubation of the vial the coloration of the solution will indicate the amount of glyphosate that was present in the sample.</P></DIV><P>


Firstly, Roundup<SUP>®</SUP> has to be sprayed on top of a soil sample. In a second step, water has to be applied to extract glyphosate from the soil sample. The solution will then be filtered through a filter device to remove soil fragments and microorganisms. Fourth, the sample will be applied onto solid media powder with all necessary ingredients including spores of the two competing <EM>B. subtilis</EM> strains. The sample has to be incubated for 10 h at 37°C with agitation. Finally, the blue color of the bacterial solution will be compared to a test strip. The intensity of the blue color roughly determines the concentration of glyphosate in the sample.</P><P>The application of our product is illustrated in the following movie:</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
