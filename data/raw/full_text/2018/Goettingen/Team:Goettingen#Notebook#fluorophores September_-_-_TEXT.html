Plating for the competition assay, competition assay
03.09.18
The calculated dilutions were plated on LB-agar and were cultivated over night at 37°C in dark. The plates were quartered, in each quarter was one dilution from 0, 1, 2, and 3&bnbsp;h.
Furthermore, a new competition assay was prepared for the multiwell-reader. The setup was the same as on 29.08.18.

Strains in 100 µL CS-Glc on 96-well plate. The absorption was measured at λ=600 nm (OD600). Also, the fluorescence was measured. GFP ex: 488 nm; em: 509 nm. mOrange ex: 529 nm; em: 562 nm.
Competition assay with lacZ
04.09.18
A new competition assay was created, where we used a glyphosate-resistant strain (BP235) and a sensitive strain (BP193). Strain BP193 harbors a lacZ-copy behind a constitutive active promoter, so a β–galactosidase is always expressed. When X-Gal is added to the medium, the strength of the blue color should decrease with increasing glyphosate concentrations. These cultures were incubated for 24 h with doubled amount of X-Gal.

The result shows exactly what was proposed before.

Competition assay
07.09.18
Inoculation of 4 mL LB medium with cryocultures from strains iGEM23, iGEM28, and iGEM36. The cultures were incabated at 37°C until the OD600 was about 1.5. Then, 200 µL of the cultures were transferred into 10 mL. This cultures were incubated at 37°C until the OD600 was about 1. An OD600 of 1 was adjusted in 1&nbps;mL CS-Glc medium. 1:1 mixtures of strains iGEM23/iGEM28 and iGEM23/iGEM36 were prepared. Then, 10 µL of the cultures were transferred into the wells of the plate.

Competition assay
10.09.18
A new competition assay was prepared, using strain mixture iGEM23/iGEM36 and iGEM35/BP193. Mixture iGEM23/iGEM36 is treated with increasing glyphosate concentrations and fluorescence of GFP and mOrange is measured. Mixture iGEM35/BP193 is also treated with increasing glyphosate concentrations, fluorescence of GFP is measured and absorbance at λ=670 nm is measured, this resembles the absorption maximum of X-Gal.

Competition assay under the microscope
17.09.18
Strains iGEM23 and iGEM36 were inoculated over night at 37°C. The next morning, part of the cultures was transferred into 10 mL CS-Glc medium to obtain an OD600 of 0.1, incubation until cultures have OD600 of about 1–1.5. Cells were mixed 1:1 ratio and grown in increasing glyphosate concentrations from 0–4 mM. After 3 h were 10 µL harvested and observed under the fluorescence microscope with filters for GFP and mOrange. <a href=" https://2018.igem.org/Team:Goettingen/Results ">Here are the results of this experiment.</a>
Competition assay
18.09.18
Strains 168 (WT), iGEM23, iGEM24, iGEM28, and iGEM36 were incubated over night in LB medium and in the morning transferred into CS-Glc medium. The rest of the cultures from all cultures, except iGEM23, were pelleted to show the orange color of the cells.

The wildtype strain 168 from Bacillus subtilis does not show orange color, while the tagged strains are orange colored.
Also, a new competition assay was planned.

Competition assay with Roundup®
21.09.18
This time, we used Roundup® instead of pure glyphosate for our growth experiments! We tested the wildtype (168) and the two transporter mutants BP233 and BP235 with increasing Roundup® concentrations (0–20 mM).

24.09.18
A new competition assay was planned, comparing Roundup® and pure glyphosate with our normal testmixture made of iGEM23 and iGEM36.
