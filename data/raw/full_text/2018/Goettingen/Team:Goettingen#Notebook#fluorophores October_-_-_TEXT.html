Preparing of β–galactosidase assay
08.10.18
Propagating of strains BP193 and BP235 on SP medium. The plates were incubated over day at 37°C. In the evening, 10 mL of CS-Glc medium were inoculated with a single colony of the strains. The cultures were incubated over night at 28°C.
β–galactosidase assay
09.10.18
In the morning, 10 mL CS-Glc medium with increasing glyphosate concentrations (0–5 mM) were inoculated with both strains with an OD600 of 0.05 to obtain OD600 of 0.1.
The cultures were grown to an OD600 of 0.6. 2 mL of the culture were harvested with centrifugation. The β–galactosidase assay was performed as described in the experiments section. The following table shows the results.
