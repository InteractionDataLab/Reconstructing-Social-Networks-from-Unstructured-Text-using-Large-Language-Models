We are especially grateful to our numerous sponsors on gofundme,  who supported our project and made it possible.
Every public donor, who helped us to achieve our goals got a special place on our bacterial wall of fame and a handdrawn microbe to show our appreciation. A link to that wall can be found here:

Part collection for glyphosate resistance
In this collection, we gathered all parts that contribute to the resistance against the herbicide glyphosate. First of all the two newly identified glyphosate transporters GltT and GltP. If both transporters are not present anymore, the soil bacterium B. subtilis is glyphosate resistant. The target of glyphosate is the EPSP synthase, which is encoded by the aroE gene in B. subtilis and by the aroA gene in E. coli. If the target is mutated, like in our part BBa_K2586020 , the cells are characterized by a high glyphosate resistance. If the cells express the gene encoding the glyphosate-N-acetyl-transferase (GAT), they are also resistant. In conclusion, our collection can serve as a powerful toolbox to genetically engineer organisms for enhancing the resistance towards glyphosate and to improve inactivation or degradation of the weedkiller by microbes.
