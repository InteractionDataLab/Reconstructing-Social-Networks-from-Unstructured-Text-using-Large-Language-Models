Amplification of fluorophore genes
01.08.18
Since the transformation did not work, we amplified the fluorophore genes again. Therefore, we used the same DNA templates as before with the same primer combinations. The parameters were not changed. We also digested the plasmid pAC7.

The digest was finally incubated with 1 µL "Fast AP" for 10 min at 37°C and eluted in 30 µL H2O.
Again amplification of fluorophore genes
02.08.18
Since the amplifications did not work correctly, we diluted the primers again and changed the annealing temperatures in the PCR programs. This time, it worked out. We digested the fluorophore genes with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and BamRI for 30 min at 37°C. We used the genes bfp, gfp, and morange since mcherry did not work yet.
All values are given in [µL].

The ligation samples were incubated for 2 h at roomtemperature in the dark. Afterwards, competent cells of E. coli strain DH5α were transformed and plated on LB-agar containing ampicillin for selection.

Preparation of plasmid preparation

2 colonies from DH5α-BFP and DH5α-mOrange were transferred to 10 mL LB medium containing ampicillin and incubated over night at 37°C. For DH5α-GFP, we transferred the cells into 100 µL LB medium, incubated the cultures, and transferred from this culture 50 µL into 10 mL LB medium.
Plasmid preparation
06.08.18
The prepared cultures were harvested to isolate the plasmids from the cells. In addition, pAC7 was isolated. The results are shown in the table below.

All samples were test digested with EcoRI and BamHI for 10 min. The samples were put on an agarose gel and all plasmids were positive. The samples pAC7-BFP #1, pAC7-GFP #2, and pAC7-mOrange #2 were chosen for transformation and sent for sequencing. The Bacillus subtilis strains 168 (WT), BP233, BP235 were transformed with every fluorophore plasmid. The transformed cells were propagated on SP medium containing kanamycin for selection.

α-amylase activity assay
08.08.18
To check the correct insertion of the fluorophore genes into the amyE locus in the Bacillus genome, an α-amylase activity assays was performed. All strains were streaked on starch-agar and incubated over day at 42°C. In the evening, Lugol's solution was given on the plate. If the fluorophore was correctly inserted in the amyE locus, the cells do not have a halo around them. All strains were correct.
Growth experiments
20.08.18
Strains 168, iGEM23, iGEM24, and iGEM25 were incubated over night at 28°C. In the morning, 10 mL CS-Glc medium were inoculated with 100 µL of the respective cultures. The cultures were incubated at 37°C for 5&nbps;h. Afterwards, 5 µL of the cultures were transferred on a 96-well plate containing 100 µL of CS-Glc medium.

The evaluation showed that GFP was perfectly measured and the strain works as planned. The excitation and emmission was corrected to 399 nm and 456 nm, respectively. The measurement of mOrange was adjusted to 529&nbps;nm excitation and 562 nm emission.
Also, a new 96-well plate was prepared for a new growth experiment with adjusted parameters.

The fluorophore-tagged transporter mutants BP233 and BP235 were tested in a growth experiment. Therefore, a new 96-well plate was prepared.

Competition assays
29.08.18
Competition assay with the help of the multiwell-reader. Strain iGEM23 was mixed with strains iGEM28 and iGEM36, respectively, in a 1:1 ratio. All strains were also cultivated separately as a control. The fluorescence of GFP and mOrange was measured. The next figure shows the layout of the 96-well plate.

Evaluation of platereader and competition assay
30.08.18
The competition assay showed that with increasing glyphosate concentrations the fluorescence of GFP drecreased, while the fluorescence of mOrange increased. The controls grew normally as expected.
Â competition assay in shake flasks was performed with increasing glyphosate concentrations from 0–4 mM. The optical density was measured at λ=600 nm. According to this, dilutions were calculated to plate the same amounts of cells.
