Cryo cultures of strains 168, BP233, BP234 were prepared with 90% LB medium and 10% DMSO. The cells were frozen and stored at -80°C.

The strains BP233, BP235 and the WT strain 168 were propagated to 3 ml LB medium and inoculated for 4 h at 37°C and 220 rpm. They were harvested in a 2 ml reaction tube by centrifugation at 13000 rpm for one minute. The supernatant was discared and the cells were washed in 1x C-Salts. Afterwards, they were resuspended in 300 µl 1x C-Salts. The OD600 was determined.

The cells were then struck out on cs-glucose agar plates with variating glyphosate concentrations. 168 was propagated on plates containing 0 mM  and 10 mM glyphosate, while BP233 was additionally propagated on plates with the glyphosate concentrations of 30 mM and 40 mM.BP235 was additonally propagated on plates containing glyphosate concentrations of 50 mM and 60 mM. All agar plates were then inoculated at 37 °C for 2 days.
The strains 168, BP233 and BP236 were propagated to 3 ml LB medium and inoculated for 4 h at 37°C and 220 rpm. They were harvested in a 2 ml reaction tube by centrifugation at 13000 rpm for one minute. The supernatant was discared and the cells were washed in 1x C-Salts. Afterwards, they were resuspended in 300 µl 1x C-Salts. The OD600 was determined.

100 µl of solutions were propagated on CS-Glucose agar plates containing 0 mM glyphosate as well as plates containing 10 mM glyphosate. These plates were inoculated at 37 °C for 2 days.

The growth of the evolved suppressor mutants of the strains 168, BP233 and BP235 on 10 mM and 0 mM glyphosate CS-glucose agar plates was documented.
