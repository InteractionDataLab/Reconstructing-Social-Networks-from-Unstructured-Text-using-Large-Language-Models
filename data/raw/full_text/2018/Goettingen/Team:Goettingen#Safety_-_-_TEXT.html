We are especially grateful to our numerous sponsors on gofundme,  who supported our project and made it possible.
Every public donor, who helped us to achieve our goals got a special place on our bacterial wall of fame and a handdrawn microbe to show our appreciation. A link to that wall can be found here:

The safety measures in our laboratory
This picture shows our autoclave that is used to kill biological material at 121°C for 20 min.
This picture shows the whole-body safety shower (above the blue door) and the eye shower (next to the sink). The showers can be used to remove chemicals from eyes and to extinguish fire.
Experiments that require organic solvents and other volatile chemicals are carried out under the fume hood to avoid inhalation of the compounds.
This picture shows the biosafety cabinet that matches the advice from iGEM. The biological experiments that need sterile conditions are carried out in this cabinet.
