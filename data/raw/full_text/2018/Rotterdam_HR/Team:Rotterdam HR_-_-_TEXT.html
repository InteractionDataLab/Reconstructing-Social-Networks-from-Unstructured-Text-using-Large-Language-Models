Team Rotterdam
We are team Rotterdam, the first iGEM team from the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. We are a team with   multiple disciplinaries: five Biology and Medical Laboratory research students; two Chemistry students; two   Electrical Engineering students and even a Computer Science student. Together we make an efficient and effective team.
We stand out because of our focus on the hardware due to our two electrical engineers. We also have the ability to   create powerful software to bolster our efficiency.
