Protocol 1 : NucleoSpin® Plasmid EasyPure protocol mini (Marchery Nagel)
1 Cultivate and harvest bacterial cells
Use 2–10 mL of a saturated E. coli culture (see page 8, table 3), pellet cells in a standard benchtop microcentrifuge   for 30 s at > 12,000 x g.   Discard the supernatant and remove as much of the liquid as possible. > 12,000 x g, 30 s
2 Cell lysis
Add 150 μL Buffer A1. Resuspend the cell pellet completely by vortexing or pipetting up and down. Make sure no cell   clumps remain before addition of Buffer A2!   Attention: Check Buffer A2 for precipitated SDS. If a white precipitate is visible, warm the buffer for several   minutes at 30–40 °C until precipitate is dissolved completely. Cool buffer down to room temperature (18–25 °C) before   use.   Add 250 μL Buffer A2. Mix gently by inverting the tube 5 times. Do not vortex to avoid shearing of genomic DNA.   Incubate at room temperature (18–25 °C) for up to 2 min or until lysate appears clear. Add 350 μL Buffer A3. Mix thoroughly by inverting the tube until LyseControl has turned colorless throughout the   lysate without any traces of blue color. Do not vortex to avoid shearing of genomic DNA!   + 150 μL A1   Resuspend   + 250 μL A2   Mix   RT, 2 min   + 350 μL A3   Mix
3 Clarification of lysate
Centrifuge for 3 min at full speed (> 12,000 x g). > 12,000 x g, 3 min
4 Bind DNA
Place a NucleoSpin® Plasmid EasyPure Column into a Collection Tube (2 mL) and decant the supernatant from step 3 onto   the column.   Centrifuge for 30 s at 1,000–2,000 x g.   Discard flow-through and place the spin column back into the collection tube.   Load supernatant   1,000– 2,000 x g, 30 s
5 Wash and dry silica membrane
Add 450 μL Buffer AQ (supplemented with ethanol, see section 3).   Centrifuge for 1 min at full speed (> 12,000 x g).   Very carefully discard the collection tube and the flow- through and make sure the spin cup outlet does not touch the   wash buffer surface. Otherwise repeat the centrifugation step.   Note: To reduce ethanol carry-over to a minimum for better performance in downstream applications, incubate spin cup   for 10–15 min at 37 °C to dry silica membrane completely.   + 450 μL AQ > 12,000 x g, 1 min
6 Elute DNA
Place the NucleoSpin® Plasmid EasyPure Column in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (not provided) and add 50 μL Buffer   AE.   Incubate for 1 min at room temperature (18–25 °C).   Centrifuge for 1 min at full speed (> 12,000 x g).   Note: For more efficient elution procedures and alternative elution buffer (e.g., TE buffer or water) see section   2.4.   + 50 μL AE   RT, 1 min > 12,000 x g, 1 min
Protocol 2 : NucleoBond® Xtra plasmid purification midi/maxi (Marchery Nagel)
1 Preparation of starter culture
Inoculate a 3–5 mL starter culture of LB medium with a single colony picked from a freshly streaked agar plate. Make   sure that plate and liquid culture contain the appropriate selective antibiotic to guarantee plasmid propagation (see   section 4.3 for more information). Shake at 37 °C and ~ 300 rpm for ~ 8 h.
2 Preparation of large overnight culture
Inoculate an overnight culture by diluting the starter culture 1 / 1000 into the given volumes of LB medium also   containing the appropriate selective antibiotic. Grow the culture overnight at 37 °C and ~ 300 rpm for 12–16 h.   100 mL 300 mL
3 Harvest of bacterial cells
Measure the cell culture OD 600 and determine the recommended culture volume.   V [mL] = 400 / OD 600   V [mL] = 1200 / OD   600   Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 4,500–6,000 x g for ≥ 10 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant completely.   Note: Optimal lysis conditions are achieved by a unique ratio of lysis buffer RES, LYS, and NEU to the cell mass. See   section 4.5 for recommendations concerning the optimal pelleted culture volume for cells containing high-copy   plasmids and section 4.6 for recommendations concerning cells with low-copy plasmids. Read section 4.5 carefully as   excess cell input will result in reduced yield. The recommended culture volumes below are calculated for a final OD   600 of around 4.
4 Resuspension (Buffer RES)
Resuspend the cell pellet completely in Resuspension Buffer RES + RNase A by pipetting the cells up and down or   vortexing the cells.   For an efficient cell lysis it is important that no clumps remain in the suspension.   Note: Increase RES buffer volume proportionally if more than the recommended cell mass is used (see section 4.8 for   information on optimal cell lysis and section 4.9 regarding difficult-to-lyse strains).
5
Cell lysis (Buffer LYS) !   Check Lysis Buffer LYS for precipitated SDS prior to use. If a white precipitate is visible, warm the buffer for   several minutes at 30–40 °C until precipitate is dissolved completely. Cool buffer down to room temperature (18–25   °C).   Add Lysis Buffer LYS to the suspension.   Mix gently by inverting the tube 5 times. Do not vortex as this will shear and release contaminating chromosomal DNA   from cellular debris into the suspension.   Incubate the mixture at room temperature (18–25 °C) for 5 min.   Warning: Prolonged exposure to alkaline conditions can irreversibly denature and degrade plasmid DNA and liberate   contaminating chromosomal DNA into the lysate.   Note: Increase LYS buffer volume proportionally if more than the recommended cell mass is used (see section 4.8 for   information on optimal cell lysis).   8 mL 12 mL
6 Equilibration (Buffer EQU)
Equilibrate a NucleoBond® Xtra Column together with the inserted column filter with Equilibration Buffer EQU.   Apply the buffer onto the rim of the column filter as shown in the picture and make sure to wet the entire filter.   Allow the column to empty by gravity flow. The column does not run dry.   12 mL 25 mL
7
Neutralization (Buffer NEU) !   Add Neutralization Buffer NEU to the suspension and immediately mix the lysate gently by inverting the tube until   blue samples turns colorless completely! Do not vortex.   The flask or tube used for this step should not be filled more than two thirds to allow homogeneous mixing. Make sure   to neutralize completely to precipitate all the protein and chromosomal DNA. The lysate should turn from a slimy,   viscous consistency to a low viscosity, homogeneous suspension of an off-white flocculate. In addition, LyseControl   should turn completely colorless without any traces of blue.   Immediately proceed with step 8. An incubation of the lysate is not necessary.   Note: Increase NEU buffer volume proportionally if more than the recommended cell mass is used (see section 4.8 for   information on optimal cell lysis).   8 mL 12 mL
8
Clarification and loading !   Make sure to have a homogeneous suspension of the precipitate by inverting the tube 3 times directly before applying   the lysate to the equilibrated NucleoBond® Xtra Column Filter to avoid clogging of the filter.   The lysate is simultaneously cleared and loaded onto the column. Refill the filter if more lysate has to be loaded   than the filter is able to hold. Allow the column to empty by gravity flow.   Alternative: The precipitate can be removed by centrifugation at ≥ 5,000 x g for at least 10 min, for example if more   than double the recommended cell mass was used. If the supernatant still contains suspended matter transfer it to a   new tube and repeat the centrifugation, preferably at higher speed, or apply the lysate to the equilibrated   NucleoBond® Xtra Column Filter.   This clarification step is extremely important since residual precipitate may clog the NucleoBond® Xtra Column. To   load the column you can either apply the cleared lysate to the equilibrated filter or remove the unused filter   beforehand. Allow the column to empty by gravity flow.   Note: You may want to save all or part of the flow-through for analysis (see section 8.1).    Midi Maxi

1st Wash: Column filter and column !   (Buffer EQU)   Wash the NucleoBond® Xtra Column Filter and Nu-cleoBond® Xtra Column with Equilibration Buffer EQU.   Apply the buffer to the funnel shaped rim of the filter and make sure it is washing out the lysate which is remaining   in the filter. Omitting this step or just pouring the buffer directly inside the funnel may reduce plasmid yield.   5 mL 15 mL
10 Filter removal
Either pull out the NucleoBond® Xtra Column Filter or discard it by turning the column upside down.
11
2nd Wash: Column only (Buffer WASH) !   Wash the NucleoBond® Xtra Column with Wash Buffer WASH. It is important to remove the column filter before applying   the washing buffer to avoid low purity.   8 mL 25 mL
12 Elution (Buffer ELU)
Elute the plasmid DNA with Elution Buffer ELU. Collect the eluate in a 15 mL or 50 mL centrifuge tube (not provided).   Note: Preheating Buffer ELU to 50 °C prior to elution may improve yields for large constructs such as BACs.   Optional: Determine plasmid yield by UV spectrophotometry in order to adjust desired concentration of DNA in step 15   and calculate the recovery after precipitation.   5 mL 15 mL !   NucleoBond® Xtra Midi / Maxi Plus:   Proceed with step 13 for the centrifugation protocol after isopropanol precipitation or continue with section 7.3 for   plasmid concentration and desalting by using the NucleoBond® Finalizer (NucleoBond® Xtra Midi Plus) or NucleoBond®   Finalizer Large (NucleoBond® Xtra Maxi Plus).
13 Precipitation
Add room-temperature isopropanol to precipitate the eluted plasmid DNA.   Vortex thoroughly!   Centrifuge at ≥ 4,500 x g for ≥ 15 min at ≤ room temperature, preferably at 15,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. Carefully   discard the supernatant.   3.5 mL 10.5 mL
14 Washing and drying
Add room-temperature 70 % ethanol to the pellet.   2 mL 14 mL   Centrifuge at ≥ 4,500 x g, preferably ≥ 15,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature (18–25 °C).   Carefully remove ethanol completely from the tube with a pipette tip. Allow the pellet to dry at room temperature   (18–25 °C).   Note: Plasmid DNA might be harder to dissolve when over-dried.   10–15 min 15–30 min
15 Reconstitution
Dissolve the DNA pellet in an appropriate volume of buffer TE or sterile H2O.   Depending on the type of centrifugation tube, dissolve under gentle pipetting up and down or constant spinning in a   sufficient amount of buffer for 10–60 min (3D-shaker).   Determine plasmid yield by UV spectrophotometry. Confirm plasmid integrity by agarose gel electrophoresis.
