Picture I: Seriousness of Carbon Monoxide Hazard Throughout Industry
Carbon monoxide is universally present in industry. Partial oxidation of       compounds which contain carbon results in the production of carbon monoxide. With the lack of enough oxygen it is       formed instead of carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide is a colorless and odorless gas and therefore does not
give any warning of its presence to those exposed.       Physiologically, carbon monoxide acts by displacing oxygen from the haemoglobin molecule. When encountered it       is toxic for humans in concentrations as low as 35 parts per million (ppm). This is because haemoglobin has an affinity for the       poisonous gas that is 210 times higher compared to oxygen. High blood level concentrations of the compound       prevents sufficient amounts of oxygen from reaching vital organs. In America alone several thousand workers die       each year from carbon monoxide exposure, making it one of the most dangerous industrial hazards.
Picture II: Carbon Monoxide is Bound by Our CooA Protein
The carbon monoxide detection system that we have been developing for the iGEM       competition contains modified bacteria in a specific medium. It is this
medium in which the carbon monoxide from the polluted area       will dissolve. The bacteria in the system synthesize the receptor protein CooA, a member of the cAMP receptor       protein family, which functions in a similar way as haemoglobin. Besides its capacity to bind carbon monoxide,       the CooA protein also functions as a transcription factor. Therefore, CooA will not only detect the carbon       monoxide from the polluted area, but also regulate the rate of an output signal.
Picture III: Bound Carbon Monoxide Initiates the Production of Carbon Monoxide
Binding of carbon monoxide to
the CooA protein initiates the transcription of the protein       pyruvate decarboxylase. As a result, the synthesized pyruvate decarboxylase will convert the pyruvate that is present in the medium into CO2 gas. The medium is flanked by two electrodes that produce a constant electrical current through the medium. When       the CO2 gas production reaches a certain threshold, gas will accumulate and replace the medium at the       location between the two electrodes. This results in a change in the resistance between the electrodes. Detection       of the changing resistance by the hardware will set off an alarm.
Picture IV: Too Much Production of CO2 Leads to an Alarm: No more false alarms
Present-day carbon monoxide detectors experience complications in       differentiating between carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas.
Because hydrogen gas is a by-product in many industries, this       interference problem can result in many false alarms. The developed device will selectively detect carbon       monoxide with the use of the CooA protein and therefore has a great advantage over currently used detectors in       industry.
Detailed Description
Selective Carbon Monoxide Detection
This project is focussed on manufacturing a carbon monoxide detection system. Despite the fact that there are       already detection systems for carbon monoxide on the market. There is nothing wrong with the sensitivity of the       present-day detection systems. However, carbon monoxide detectors that are used in various industries have       difficulty in differentiating between carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas. Because hydrogen gas is a by-product in       many industries, this interference problem can result in many false alarms.
The CooA Protein
In order to create a device that can selectively detect carbon monoxide in a biological pathway, it is crucial       to have a protein that can sense carbon monoxide molecules. The receptor protein CooA, a member of the cAMP       receptor protein (CRP) family, is such a protein. In nature this heme-containing CooA protein is synthesised by       the bacteria Rhodospirillum rubrum and functions in a similar way as haemoglobin. Besides its capacity to bind to       CO, the CooA protein also functions as a transcription factor. When a CooA protein binds to a carbon monoxide       molecule it alters its own structure. Due to this change in structure the CooA receptor can bind to a specific       DNA sequence: a CooA-dependent promotor. In the R. rubrum bacteria the location of the CooA-binding site on the       DNA forms the foundation for the transcription of the cooFSCTJ and cooMKLXUH operons, which code for the       synthesis of proteins that oxidize CO to CO2. Thus, in R. rubrum bacteria CooA regulates the rate of       the transcription of the genetic information that encodes for proteins that allow growth of this organism on CO       as a sole energy source.
Gas Detection and Gas Production
For a CO detection system the binding of CO to the CooA protein has to initiate the transcription of proteins       that can deliver an output signal, instead of the original mechanism where proteins are synthesised that can       oxidize CO to CO2. As a replacement for the original operons, a gene was ligated into the DNA sequence       that enables the synthesis of the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc). Accordingly, pdc can convert the pyruvate       that is present in the medium into CO2 and acetaldehyde. The released CO2 gas in the medium       will be collected in a compartment where a constant electrical current goes through. As a result, the medium in       the compartment will be replaced by the produced CO2 gas. When a certain threshold is reached in the       amount of produced gas a change in the resistance will occur, which can be detected by the hardware. Minimal       concentrations of carbon monoxide in unpolluted air already result in the production of CO2 gas that       can add up and eventually reach the threshold. Therefore it was also necessary to design a constant draining       system.
Other output signal molecules were taken into consideration as well. For instance, producing an electrical       signal by bacteria that release electrons which subsequently can be detected by the hardware. However, oxygen       molecules in the medium can capture these released electrons. Designing an anaerobic environment to counter this       problem resulted in additional complications.
