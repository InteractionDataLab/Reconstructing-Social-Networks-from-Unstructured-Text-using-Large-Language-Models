				We went to the DAS conference, this conference is a meeting for everyone working inside an institution that
				provides education for laboratory studies. Our goal on this event was to provide information about iGEM through the
				Netherlands and make contacts with specialist. These specialist gave mini presentations in which we learned about
				sensors, chips and chemical processes.
				We also presented our top 3 ideas by handing out brochures, on which we received feedback and input for improvement of
				our additions. We were very happy to make contacts and carry out the iGEM competition through the Netherlands.

				Today we went to the National Career Event in Amsterdam. This is a big Dutch event where more than 120 employers
				gather to expose their company to a bigger audience and share contact information with potential recruits and
				interns. We had hoped to familiarize some relevant companies to iGEM along with trying to attain some sponsors.
				Sadly the event was primarily focused on IT companies with a very small representation of chemical companies and nothing
				biology related. Despite this it was a valuable team bonding experience.

				Also were we present at the dutch NBC conference, where we got the chance to show and tell about our project.
				During this day several professionals and students working in the biotechnology workfield were connected. They were
				informed during interactive sessions and got to know all about the latest developments in their workfield.

				After we went to the National Career Event in Amsterdam, we thought that it might be helpful if we'd go to more
				events. Today we went to the BCF (biology, chemistry and pharmacy) in Utrecht to promote our project. The BCF
				career event is an event just like the one in Amsterdam but only for biology, chemistry and pharmacy. It was a nice
				day where we shared a lot of our business cards with the present companies.

				We got control of the iGEM teams worldwide account on instagram for a week (June 4th until June 10th 2018). We did

				it as well!

				To spread more knowledge on what genetically modified organisms are and what they can do, we decided to do a
				presentation on a high school. Unfortunately, we’re only going to do the presentation after the Giant Jamboree so
				we don’t have the photo’s of the event just yet. We are looking forward to give some education!
