Mentored by iGEM team Leiden
Organised by Leiden and Rotterdam HR
April 25th 2018, August 15th 2018 and September 27th 2018
As a new team into the iGEM competition we wanted some coaching from another team so we contacted iGEM team Leiden     early in the competition. Team Leiden has participated the competition in 2014 with TU-Delft and in 2016. So Leiden     is also a team with less experience than other Dutch teams.
During the competition we met each other three times, two of them where actual mentoring sessions. Our first     meeting was at a bar in Leiden on April 25th 2018. We met each other for the first time and talked a lot about the     iGEM competition. They had already chosen a project and gave us some tips about how to choose a project. It was a     very nice evening and we learned a lot about iGEM and each other.
The first real mentor session was in Leiden on August 15th 2018. We started the meeting with a small presentation     of both teams about the laboratory progress, human practices, PR, wiki, budget and fundraising. After the     presentations the teams were divided in management groups, here we discussed the progress and problems in more     detail. We told them about how we divided the tasks between the team, how we reached out to companies and media and     about some laboratory work. They gave us a lot of tips and tricks about crowdfunding campaigns, social media and     labwork. The team leaders remained in close contact during the contest so they could help each other with problems     as quickly and efficiently as possible. The succes of the mentoring session led to a second one on September 27th     2018.
It was an honour to be mentored by team Leiden. We know that they will succeed because of their amazing individuals     at the Giant Jamboree in Boston!
Mike the Microbe

August 10th 2018
The iGEM team Carroll asked us to join their collaboration called Mike the Microbe. For this collaboration we     needed to made a picture of Mike at our lab. So we made three pictures of Mike and posted it on our Instagram!
Dutch Meetup BBQ
Organised by iGEM Leiden
August 17th 2018
This summer we were invited to the Dutch Meetup BBQ by team Leiden. Thanks to Leiden we met the other Dutch teams     and participated in a pub quiz accompanied by a lot of food and beer. It was a great evening with all the attendant     teams!

Organised by Rotterdam HR
August 17th 2018
Participants: Leiden, TU Delft, Utrecht, Eindhoven and Groningen
We contacted Frank Sekeris (NBV) for publishing something on their website. We coordinated everything and all the     teams wrote a short article (Â± 300 words) and included a picture. All the articles were put together and there was     put a logo of each team above the articles. This was send to Frank Sekeris. We informed the teams after this when     and where the articles were published.
Wiki statistics
Organised by Rotterdam HR
August 28th 2018 until the Giant Jamboree
As a team interested in building a good wiki we liked to know which iGEM team pages were the most popular. To get     the best data for inspiration, we made a web application for ranking all teampages by views. Using this application     we can search for the current best pages. There is even an option to filter for a certain team and/or subpage. Of     course, this application is now publically available on our wiki! We find this application helpful and we hope     other iGEM teams will use it to better their own wiki.
Biotechnology conference
Organised by Utrecht and Aachen
September 20th 2018
Team Utrecht and Aachen organised a biotechnology conference, which was really interesting. Many different     speakers, businesses and backgrounds were presented at the conferenfe. Also did we get a little presentation from     the organising teams themselves and team Utrecht 2017 with their projects. We learned a lot about the other teams     and got some tips from team Utrecht 2017. It was a nice evening and we wish team Utrecht and team Aachen the very     best, see you in Boston!
Mini Jamboree
Organised by Eindhoven
October 19th 2018
To practice the big presentation at the Giant Jamboree team TU Eindhoven decided to organise a mini Jamboree for     all the Dutch teams. They even invited official judges! It was a great day to see what all the other dutch     teams had accomplished. After this day we improved a lot on our poster and presentation. Thank you Eindhoven!
