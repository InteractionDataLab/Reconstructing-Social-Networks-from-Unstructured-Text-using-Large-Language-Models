Policy and practice
Carbon monoxide is a colourless and odourless gas so a detector is necessary to notice its presence. Our product is mainly focused on the steel industry. To make a Carbon Monoxide detector with bacteria inside it, it is important to focus on safety aspects and the efficacy of our product. That is why we communicate with experts on gas detection, possible buyers and other influential stakeholders. On this page you will find everything we did to make our product fit in the community.
Visiting the experts
Before we chose our project we went to Buveco, a gas detection company, to discuss the inefficiencies with Carbon Monoxide detectors in steel factories. The thing is, all Carbon Monoxide detectors have hydrogen interference. They detect hydrogen and carbon monoxide as the same. If the carbon monoxide detector goes off, there is no telling if the carbon monoxide levels are actually dangerous or that there is just a lot of hydrogen interference.  Buveco showed us their workplace and how their Carbon Monoxide detector works. With this information of Buveco about hydrogen interference we started to think of a way to make the detector specific for only Carbon Monoxide.
