				As a new team into the iGEM competition we wanted some coaching from another team so we contacted iGEM team Leiden
				early in the competition. Team Leiden has participated the competition in 2014 with TU-Delft and in 2016. So Leiden
				is also a team with less experience than other Dutch teams.
			</P><P>
				During the competition we met each other three times, two of them where actual mentoring sessions. Our first
				meeting was at a bar in Leiden on April 25th 2018. We met each other for the first time and talked a lot about the
				iGEM competition. They had already chosen a project and gave us some tips about how to choose a project. It was a
				very nice evening and we learned a lot about iGEM and each other.
			</P><P>
				The first real mentor session was in Leiden on August 15th 2018. We started the meeting with a small presentation
				of both teams about the laboratory progress, human practices, PR, wiki, budget and fundraising. After the
				presentations the teams were divided in management groups, here we discussed the progress and problems in more
				detail. We told them about how we divided the tasks between the team, how we reached out to companies and media and
				about some laboratory work. They gave us a lot of tips and tricks about crowdfunding campaigns, social media and
				labwork. The team leaders remained in close contact during the contest so they could help each other with problems
				as quickly and efficiently as possible. The succes of the mentoring session led to a second one on September 27th
				2018.

				It was an honour to be mentored by team Leiden. We know that they will succeed because of their amazing individuals
				at the Giant Jamboree in Boston!

				The iGEM team Carroll asked us to join their collaboration called Mike the Microbe. For this collaboration we
				needed to made a picture of Mike at our lab. So we made three pictures of Mike and posted it on our Instagram!

				This summer we were invited to the Dutch Meetup BBQ by team Leiden. Thanks to Leiden we met the other Dutch teams
				and participated in a pub quiz accompanied by a lot of food and beer. It was a great evening with all the attendant
				teams!

				We contacted Frank Sekeris (NBV) for publishing something on their website. We coordinated everything and all the
				teams wrote a short article (Â± 300 words) and included a picture. All the articles were put together and there was
				put a logo of each team above the articles. This was send to Frank Sekeris. We informed the teams after this when
				and where the articles were published.

				As a team interested in building a good wiki we liked to know which iGEM team pages were the most popular. To get
				the best data for inspiration, we made a web application for ranking all teampages by views. Using this application
				we can search for the current best pages. There is even an option to filter for a certain team and/or subpage. Of
				course, this application is now publically available on our wiki! We find this application helpful and we hope
				other iGEM teams will use it to better their own wiki.

				Team Utrecht and Aachen organised a biotechnology conference, which was really interesting. Many different
				speakers, businesses and backgrounds were presented at the conferenfe. Also did we get a little presentation from
				the organising teams themselves and team Utrecht 2017 with their projects. We learned a lot about the other teams
				and got some tips from team Utrecht 2017. It was a nice evening and we wish team Utrecht and team Aachen the very
				best, see you in Boston!

				To practice the big presentation at the Giant Jamboree team TU Eindhoven decided to organise a mini Jamboree for
				all the Dutch teams. They even invited official judges! It was a great day to see what all the other dutch
				teams had accomplished. After this day we improved a lot on our poster and presentation. Thank you Eindhoven!
