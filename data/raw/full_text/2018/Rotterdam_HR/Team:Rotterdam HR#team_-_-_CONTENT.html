							Hi! My name is Mei Ju Goemans and I am the team leader of the Rotterdam HR team.
							I am 18 years old and a second year chemistry student at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences.
							In my free time I like to dance, swim, fitness and hang out with my friends.
							I think that my knowledge of chemistry can be useful for the project and I am sure that I will learn a lot during this experience.
							
							Can't wait to see you in Boston!

							Hey! I'm Dustin, and I'm a third year student at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences.
							In the first iGEM team of our school my primary role is lab management, and supporting the managers for Budget and Fundraising, Safety, and our team leader.
							In my spare time I mostly enjoy reading, teaching myself new subjects and Aikido.
							During iGEM I hope to learn from our multidisciplinary team.
							
							We'll see each other in Boston!

							Hi I'm Elise and I'm the policy and practise manager and the co-manager of the Wiki page. I'm in my third year of the study Biology and Medical Laboratory research at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. Besides school I like to read, draw and be outside. With iGEM I hope to improve my laboratory skills and meet a lot of new people.

							How's it going? My name is Mike, I am currently in my second year pursuing Electrical Engineering at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. I am 21 years of age and like to play games and fiddle with electronics in my spare time. I am eager to learn new things and hope to pick up some knowledge about synthetic biology and chemistry along the way. I think my knowledge in the field of electrical engineering will be useful to the project, as it will give a view from another perspective.
							
							See you in Boston!

							Hello everyone,
							
							I'm Rens Boeser, an 18 year old computer science undergraduate at the University of applied sciences of Rotterdam and I am the newest member of the team.
							From now on I will take on the responsibility of creating and maintaining our wiki.
							I think I am a valuable asset to the team because of my different background and viewpoints.
							Because I study computer science I specialize in automating processes.
							In my free time I play the guitar and attend singing lessons.
							
							It is a pleasure to be a part of the team. I will strive to be a valuable member!

							I’m a biologist who, after obtaining my PhD focussed on molecular biology techniques to

							University of Applied Science. I’m also involved in setting up research projects for the

							I think it’s great to help this enthusiastic Rotterdam HR team on its way to many medals and

						I love the ambitions and energy in the synthetic biology community and it's an honor to be able to support the Rotterdam iGEM team.
						
						Looking forward to show you the results from Rotterdam and seeing the wonderful projects of all other iGEM teams, so let's meet in Boston!

							I’m a research technician with a background in molecular biology.
							To be an integral part of the Hogeschool Rotterdam iGEM supervisor team gives me the unique chance to apply different facets of my knowledge as a former iGEM’er (2014).
							Additionally, it’s a challenge to use my technical knowledge to support and encourage the team to do their utmost.
							I see iGEM as a great (networking) opportunity for students from every discipline to have a multidisciplinary collaboration and broaden their knowledge.
							
							Looking forward to the World Championship Jamboree in Boston and see all the fascinating work again!
