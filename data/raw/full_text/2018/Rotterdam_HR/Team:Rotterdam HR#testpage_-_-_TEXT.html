Today a few changes have been made to the architecture design of the temperature controller. The choice was made to use a premade power supply as opposed to a self-made one, because this was considering the time left to finish this device the best choice. A few alterations were made to make the architecture design better readable.

A 3d drawing was made for the casing that will hold the temperature controller. The first prototype was printed, but was determent to be inadequate due to the lack of enough space for the cooler block.

In the drawing space was added to fit the cooler block for the temperature controller. Slits were added to the drawing for the nuts to slide into. The altered drawing was printed. The newly printed parts, cooler block, fan and Peltier element were assembled. Everything fit together.

A short test run was done with the newly assembled cooler. The test concluded that the temperature controller could cool a water droplet to the point of freezing and heat it back up to its boiling point.

The choice to use a computer PSU as a power supply was made. The choice was made on the grounds, that computer PSU have a standard 12, 5 and 3.3V output. This is beneficial because these are the voltages necessary for the selected components.

To have some basic biobricks ready, we stocked them by doing a plasmid isolation and freeze the DNA.

To start on a basic construct we did a digestion and ligation with the parts we isolated earlier. To prevent original constructs we did a defosphorylation after the digestion. We controlled the digestion by doing a gelelktroforeses.

We continued with the ligated DNA by transformating it to Neb10Beta. This was plated onto agarplates and incubated for 1 day.

The results of 7/12/2018 were collected, in action of this we decided to plate some ligated and transferred DNA from 7/12/2018 again. This we did because there wasn't a clear grow of colonies on the plates.

We tried to let bacteria grow on paper, therefore we used our own buisnesscards. We let the buisnesscards absorb some LB-medium and put them inside petridishes.

To know if the ligation was succesfull we will controll the DNA, therefor we ented the bacteria's with DNA in LB-medium to grow overnight. We also plated the used bacteria's onto new plates to use for further experiments.

We did a blue white screening on our buisnesscards to see if bacteria had grew on them. We transferred the buisnesscards to new petrydishes and added ITPG and X-gal to the petrydishes.

The resulst of 7/16/2018 showed that the DNA didnt ligate as planned.  To be able to digest enough DNA we did a plasmid isolation again. We digested this DNA and froze it for further use.
