The Das Conference
March 30th 2018
We went to the DAS conference, this conference is a meeting for everyone working inside an institution that     provides education for laboratory studies. Our goal on this event was to provide information about iGEM through the     Netherlands and make contacts with specialist. These specialist gave mini presentations in which we learned about     sensors, chips and chemical processes.     We also presented our top 3 ideas by handing out brochures, on which we received feedback and input for improvement of     our additions. We were very happy to make contacts and carry out the iGEM competition through the Netherlands.
Nationale carière beurs (National Career fair)
April 6th 2018
Today we went to the National Career Event in Amsterdam. This is a big Dutch event where more than 120 employers     gather to expose their company to a bigger audience and share contact information with potential recruits and     interns. We had hoped to familiarize some relevant companies to iGEM along with trying to attain some sponsors.     Sadly the event was primarily focused on IT companies with a very small representation of chemical companies and nothing     biology related. Despite this it was a valuable team bonding experience.
The dutch NBC conference
May 22th 2018
Also were we present at the dutch NBC conference, where we got the chance to show and tell about our project.     During this day several professionals and students working in the biotechnology workfield were connected. They were     informed during interactive sessions and got to know all about the latest developments in their workfield.
BCF career event
May 24th 2018
After we went to the National Career Event in Amsterdam, we thought that it might be helpful if we'd go to more     events. Today we went to the BCF (biology, chemistry and pharmacy) in Utrecht to promote our project. The BCF     career event is an event just like the one in Amsterdam but only for biology, chemistry and pharmacy. It was a nice     day where we shared a lot of our business cards with the present companies.
IGEMteams worldwide account
June 4th until Juni 10th 2018
We got control of the iGEM teams worldwide account on instagram for a week (June 4th until June 10th 2018). We did     really enjoy it to show the worldwide iGEM teams a little bit of us and our country, of course we hope you enjoyed     it as well!

After the Giant Jamboree
To spread more knowledge on what genetically modified organisms are and what they can do, we decided to do a     presentation on a high school. Unfortunately, we’re only going to do the presentation after the Giant Jamboree so     we don’t have the photo’s of the event just yet. We are looking forward to give some education!
