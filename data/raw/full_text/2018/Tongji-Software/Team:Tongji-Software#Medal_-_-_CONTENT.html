This contribution should be central to your project and equivalent in difficulty to making and submitting a BioBrick Part.</B><SPAN class="detail">Our project is to help synthetic biologist design metabolic pathway in microorganisms. We provide users with enzyme gene information of Biobricks, including sequence information and physiochemical characteristics. The core idea is to design proper and efficient pathway and recommend Biobricks (mainly enzyme gene) for users’ need.</SPAN><SPAN class="top" id="Silver">Silver</SPAN><B>✔Convince the judges that something you created (art &amp; design, hardware, software, etc.) performs its intended function.
