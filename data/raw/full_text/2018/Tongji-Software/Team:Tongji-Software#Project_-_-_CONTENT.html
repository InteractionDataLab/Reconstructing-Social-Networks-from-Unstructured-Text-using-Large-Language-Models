        What is Alpha Ant?</SPAN><SPAN class="fig">  Already got a brilliant idea in metabolic engineering?
        Too much information to search?
        Still,
        You need Alpha Ant as a guide</SPAN><SPAN class="detail"><B>Alpha ant is a computational tool for pathway design and reconstruction. With full consideration of metabolic burden and some useful functions, we provide an efficient and powerful pathway design guide.</B></SPAN><SPAN class="h1" id="why">
        Why Alpha Ant?</SPAN><SPAN class="second_title">Background</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Pathway engineering has been proven indispensable in synthetic biology for its utility in design of microbes for generating value-added products, which is also the ultimate goal of our project. The core idea is to design and reconstruct pathway for proper use, including introducing heterologous metabolic reaction into a host organism, optimizing genetic processes within cells, modeling for yield prediction, flux balance analysis and so on. </SPAN><SPAN class="detail">However, it’s quite a challenge to design an efficient pathway while balancing the metabolic burden in certain organism. For example, it require sorting through thousands of possible reactions and enzymes wherein all the parameters have different substrate preferences and kinetic features. Also, valid evaluation and simulation of pathway in silico is indispensable. Of course, wet-lab experiments are necessary for pathway validation. 
           </SPAN><SPAN class="second_title">Inspiration</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">After investigating into metabolic pathway engineering, we realize that there is much work to do in a certain project. Commonly, we have to do a lot of research before we get started with actual experiment, such as database search, paper reading and so on. So that’s why we come up with this idea that help synthetic biologists do previous work in some ways.</SPAN><SPAN class="fig">Fig.1. Process of traditional pathway design.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail"> In specific, we collect metabolic data from several databases including metabolic reactions, reaction main pairs, enzyme , gene , compound and so on. In this section, we provide all the related information of metabolic pathway.  When it comes to ranking criteria, we choose some reliable ones and design novel ones to make our results more convincing. As for pathway search algorithm, we choose DFS (depth first search) because of its great performance in both speed and quality.</SPAN><SPAN class="h1" id="origin">
        Origin of Name: Alpha Ant</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Alpha Ant stands for an efficient and convenient tool for pathway engineering. Alpha means ‘origin’. In fact, Alpha Ant is the first software equipped with comprehensive ranking criteria.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Recently, it impressed people by the project “Alpha GO”, which also endowed “Alpha” with intelligence. Alpha Ant means its capacity to find the most efficient metabolic pathway linking two molecules is just like the ant colony’s intelligence of quickly organizing itself to find the most efficient path to a food source once it has been discovered by scouts.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">So ants are great signal detector and way finder.</SPAN><SPAN class="fig">Fig.2.The meaning and origin of the name-Alpha Ant.</SPAN><SPAN class="h1" id="Applied">
        Applied Design</SPAN><SPAN class="second_title">Data processing</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">We acquire metabolic reactions, gene information from KEGG. Standard Gibbs Energy are from MetaCyc and eQuilibrator. Furthermore, we obtain compound information from KEGG , ChEBI &amp; KnowledgeBase. Enzyme data are from BRENDA and KEGG. The small molecular drug information is from DRUGBANK. Besides, we use MayaChemTools to calculate physiochemical properties of compounds.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Since we use so many databases, we came across some problem during data processing. Most challenging thing is to string all these information together because each database has its unique ID and special data format. We tried our best to integrate all these information and we hope our software can be useful to synthetic biologists.</SPAN><SPAN class="fig">Fig.3. Databases we use to integrate data.</SPAN><SPAN class="second_title">Algorithm</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Finding proper metabolic pathway is a typical search problem.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Consequently, we turn a biosynthesis problem into a directed graph search problem. Not only do we need to get all of the solutions that satisfy the constraints, but also need to record the search path. </SPAN><SPAN class="fig">Fig.4. we turn a biosynthesis problem into a directed graph search problem</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">We use DFS algorithm here. In theoretical computer science, DFS is typically used to traverse an entire graph, and takes time Θ(|V| + |E|),[2] linear in the size of the graph. The core idea of DFS is simple and elegant, so that it is convenient for us to introduce appropriate pruning algorithms based on the original algorithm. More details can be found in <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tongji-Software/Model">Model</A>.</SPAN><SPAN class="fig">Fig.5. DFS(depth-first search).Order in which the nodes are visited.</SPAN><SPAN class="second_title">Ranking criteria</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">In total, we have three ranking criteria, which are thermodynamic feasibility &amp; competition of heterologous reactions, frequency of reaction and toxicity of compound. Rights are given to users to decide different weights of different ranking criteria. Many of you may think that length of pathway should be one of the ranking criteria , however, the fact is that the shortest pathway could be the most unrealistic one. So we decide not to use it.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail"><B>1. Thermodynamic feasibility &amp; competition of heterologous reactions</B><SPAN class="detail">As we all known, thermodynamic feasibility of a certain reaction can decide the probability of reaction. In many occasions , the smaller standard Gibbs is, the more probability of reaction is. And so does competition of heterologous reactions. Enzymes, ribosomes and source compounds are possible things that may trigger</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">We compute the probability of each reaction with △rG through the Boltzmann distribution. According to study of Hiroyuki Kuwahara et.al[3], they derive a mathematical description of the weighting scheme. And in our software, we use this formula to compute and generate a score of each reaction.</SPAN><SPAN class="quote">(Equation 1)</SPAN><SPAN class="detail"><B>2. Frequency of reaction in all organism</B></SPAN><SPAN class="detail">The idea came from our visit to <EM>Key Synthetic Biology Laboratory of Chinese Academy of Sciences</EM>.We were inspired by Prof.Yang who is committed to synthetic biology research. After an in-depth discussion with him, we found that living creatures are of great wisdom. They know how to make good use of energy from nature and develop their own core metabolic system. So the more frequency a certain reaction is, the better and much more efficient it is. There is no doubt that core pathways are more frequently used in organisms.  </SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Consequently, we count the frequency of reaction in all orgainsms. During that process, the data distribution fully confirm that this ranking criteria is reasonable and reliable.Details can be found in <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tongji-Software/Model">Model</A>.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail"><B>3. Toxicity of compound</B></SPAN><SPAN class="detail">We use the data from KnowledgeBase to assess potential toxic effects of chemical compounds on certain organism. Then these effects will be taken into account according to the given weight when we calculate the total score.</SPAN><SPAN class="second_title">Additional functions</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class="detail">To improve is to change, to be perfect is to change often.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">At the beginning of the beginning, we only developed the most ordinary search function. After actively engaging with researchers, iGEM teams and social communities, we start to know their needs. All we need to do is to try our best to meet their needs. So we add those four functions, which are organism recommendation, atom conservation, flux balance analysis and SMILES comparison.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail"><B>1. Organism recommendation</B></SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Don’t know which chassis cell to use?</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">We offer organism recommendation function for experimenters. Based on this purpose, we develop a model to scoring each microorganism (details can be found in model section). After ranking all those score, we provide users with common used organisms in iGEM white list. At the same time, we provide links of related information about organism. </SPAN><SPAN class="detail"><B>2. Atom conservation</B></SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Given a chemical reaction, an atom mapping rule defines which atom of a substrate compound is transferred to which atom of a product compound [4]. This is helpful for many applications of system biology, in particular in metabolic pathway engineering. Reducing the loss of atoms from the start compound to the target compound is likely to provide good route candidates for pathway design. Here, we present users with atom conservation rate of different reactions.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail"><B>3.Flux Balance Analysis</B></SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a mathematical method for simulating metabolism in genome-scale reconstructions of metabolic networks. It can evaluate the metabolic flux distribution, and is one of the most used modeling approaches for metabolic systems. In comparison to traditional methods of modeling, FBA is less intensive in terms of the input data required for constructing the model. Simulations performed using FBA are computationally inexpensive and can calculate steady-state metabolic fluxes for large models (over 2000 reactions) in a few seconds on modern personal computers.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Users can select one from pathway search result. Since E.coli is the most frequently used host organism, we will analyze the selected pathway and construct a new model based on classic E.coli core model(from biomodel.com). After simulating this model, our software will provide quantitative predictions of metabolic flux patterns by using cobra toolbox which provides insights into the metabolic pathways [5].</SPAN><SPAN class="detail"><B>4. SMILES comparison</B></SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Original thinking about this topic is derived from our visits to WuXi AppTec. Experts of WuXi AppTec proposed an idea to us. They said that sometimes their company got or designed a novel compound which did not exist in current database, and they want to find a possible way to synthesize it. So it came to our mind that what if we could compare the similarity between different compounds and select the most similar compound as a trigger to help us design new synthetic pathway, which can be very useful in small molecular drug discovery and synthesis.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">First of all, we convert user’s input SMILES into molecular fingerprints by using RDkit toolbox. Then we compute similarity score between input compound and compound in databases by comparing their fingerprints. At last, output is similarity score and a ranking list.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">The best thing is that we can search not only novel compound, but also existing compound in database. So if you get a compound with structure information and you don’t know what it is, you will find its compound ID and name by using SMILES comparison.</SPAN><SPAN class="h1" id="Validation">
  Validation</SPAN><SPAN class="second_title">Pathway Search Validation</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">We validate Alpha Ant’s outcome against published pathways that were engineered into different organisms. We compare search result with Gil and MRE[3] by using reliable pathways in published paper. The results show that Alpha Ant can perform its intended function well. It identifies several pathways that are known to be productive. The results show as follows.</SPAN><B>Case study 1:</B>
Pathway for the production of flavonoids from glucose:<SPAN class="detail">Flavonoids comprise a large family of secondary plant metabolic intermediates that exhibit a wide variety of antioxidant and human health-related properties. However, their wide spread use and availability are currently limited by inefficiencies in both their chemical synthesis and extraction from natural plant sources. [6]As a result, significant strides have been made recent years in improving the microbial production of flavonoids. There are four steps of pathway that are known to be productive for the conversion of L-tyrosine to naringenin(<B>C00509</B>), the main flavonoid precursor.

But we didn’t find this path in the top 10 results in the Gil which is developed by Korea_U_Seoul.</SPAN><B>Case study 2:</B>
Production of  1,2-PD(<B>C02912</B>): <SPAN class="detail">The individual enantiomers (R-1,2-PD and S-1,2-PD) have potential uses as chiral synthons for the production of pharmaceuticals and novel polymers; however, their use is limited due to their high cost. We applied Alpha Ant to search for pathways of biological production of 1,2-PD from glucose. Most of the top eight pathways contain the core part of converting Glycerone phosphate to (R)-Propane-1,2-diol which is published in literature.[8] </SPAN><B>Parameters in Alpha Ant: S.cerevisiae   maxlength(8) weight:Gibbs(0.5)/Toxicity(0.1)/Frequency(0.4)</B><SPAN class="fig">Fig.7.

The study of Jay D. Keasling etc. designed and constructed an engineered artemisinic acid biosynthetic pathway in S. cerevisiae strain EPY224 that is productive. [9]The biochemical pathway leading from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to artemisinic acid was introduced into S. cerevisiae from A. annua.</SPAN><B>Parameters in Alpha Ant:   yeast  maxlength(8)   weight:Gibbs(0.6)/Toxicity(0.1)/Frequency(0.3)</B><SPAN class="fig">Fig. 10.

In order to develop an improved and more environmentally favorable process for 1,3-PD production, many researchers engaged to explore methods for 1,3-PD production via the microbial fermentation. Alpha Ant is able to identify the reported efficient pathway from glycerol to 1,3-PD.

We searched for the similar compound in Alpha Ant. The results showed that the molecular with same structure always has the highest score 1, which indicate that this function works well.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Here are some examples.</SPAN><B>Artemisinin</B><SPAN class="fig">Fig. 12.

Alpha Ant performs its intended function under <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tongji-Software/Requirements#Safety">safety</A> control, which is our original design. We hope that Alpha Ant could be actually useful to synthetic biologist.</SPAN><SPAN class="h1" id="Demonstrate">
  Demonstrate</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Alpha Ant can work well under realistic conditions and our system complies all rules and regulations approved by the iGEM Safty Committee. We will show the demonstration of our work below in four parts which are demonstration video, computational performance, safety and statement.</SPAN><SPAN class="second_title"> 
            Demonstration Video 
          </SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Alpha Ant is directly available on the web and can work well under different search engines. You only need to input the url: <A href="http://118.31.56.237:8099/Alpha%20ant/">Alpha Ant</A> and then use our software on the website conveniently.

            Computational Performance 
          </SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Other than the video, we also test computational performance of Alpha Ant by recording search speed of ordinary search and one-direction search. We randomly selected 50 pairs of source and target compounds for ordinary search and 50 compounds for one-direction search. The results show that it took less than 5s for Alpha Ant to exhaustively explore routes within 8 steps on average for ordinary search and less than 5s for one-direction search within 6 steps. This speed is relatively friendly to the user. The results show below.</SPAN><SPAN class="fig">Fig.18. Ordinary search speed test.

As long as you enter one of them, you will come up with many possible outcomes, some of which may inspire you to think about the problem with new ideas. </SPAN><SPAN class="fig">Fig. 25. Result page of Alpha Ant.</SPAN><B>7. Involve more data</B><SPAN class="detail">As data shows below, we have more data than Gil and almost cover all KEGG reaction,compound data. Besides, we have 630275 gene data, same as KEGG while Gil only have 1950 E.coli K12 gene information.</SPAN><SPAN class="fig">Fig. 26. Data comparison among Alpha Ant, Gil and KEGG.</SPAN><B>8. Thorough investigation and validation:more reliable</B><SPAN class="detail">After getting plenty of practical suggestion from professors, bioscientists and company researchers, we improve our project in different aspects to make the results more reliable. In addition, our software has many humanized options. Users can adjust weight that given to different ranking criteria. When users input a certain compound, we will provide corresponding search hint. More information could be found in <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tongji-Software/Human_Practices">Human Practices</A>.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Apart from things we mentioned above, we also did comparison in <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tongji-Software/Project#Validation">Validation</A> section.</SPAN><SPAN class="h1" id="Future">
  Future Plan</SPAN><SPAN class="detail"><B>Future plan1:</B>  The optimum conditions for each reactions’ enzymes may be different, we will take into accont the positions and optimum conditions of each reaction’s enzyme when ranking pathway to guarantee that the recommended optimal pathway will achieve the highest efficiency under the same condition.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail"><B>Future plan2:</B>There are other factors should be taken into account when evaluating the pathway, such as primary metabolite or secondary metabolite,growth phase or fermentation period of microorganism. We learned that in the production of industrial compounds, producers tend to use microbial fermentation in an anaerobic environment to reduce the biomass energy consumption and achieve high productity. So we will take the types of metabolite and growth state of microorganism into account when optimising pathway.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail"><B>Future plan3</B>: We will consider about modyfing existing enzymes to improve efficiency of pathway. Enzymes are often engineered to carry out new functions in the context of synthetic metabolic pathways. Enzyme modification is a challenging and promising solution for improving pathway efficiency. We are planning to read related literature and develop this excitiing funcion afterwards.</SPAN>
