            Contribution</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Alpha Ant is a convenient and efficient pathway design tool. More importantly, it is reliable. Check it in <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tongji-Software/Project#Validation">Validation</A>. We provide users with enzyme gene information of Biobricks, including sequence information and physiochemical characteristics. The core idea is to design proper and efficient pathway and recommend Biobricks (mainly enzyme gene) for users’ need.</SPAN><SPAN class="fig">Fig. 1. Home page of Alpha Ant.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">There are three main contribution to synthetic biology:</SPAN><SPAN class="detail"> First one is that we offer more possibilities. We collect 7 reliable online databases and create our own data structure, including KEGG, MetaCyc, BRENDA and so on. Users can find several possible pathways consist of different enzyme-encoding genes. Those genes could be from any organism in nature. Consequently, many possible options are given to the user. Check users’ guide in <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tongji-Software/Project#Demonstrate">Demonstrate</A>.</SPAN><SPAN class="fig">Fig. 2. Search page of Alpha Ant.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Second one is that more information is provided including Physiochemical characteristics of compounds and enzymes, gene information and FBA data. Especially the physiochemical data, changes in each one of the chassis cell system could contribute to inefficiency or failure of a pathway. So we want to provide information as much as possible. What we are doing right now is for everyone who is engaged in synthetic biology and for their consideration.</SPAN><SPAN class="fig">Fig. 3. Result page of Alpha Ant.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Third one is that we offer some very useful functions other than pathway design, which are microorganism recommendation, SMILES comparison and FBA. Actually, we are trying to meet every experimenters need as much as possible. Details can be found in <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tongji-Software/Project">Project</A> and <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tongji-Software/Model">model</A>.</SPAN><SPAN class="fig">Fig. 4.

            Safety</SPAN><SPAN class="question">Q1: Who will use your software? What will the user concern about?</SPAN><B>Alpha Ant:</B><SPAN class="detail">1. For synthetic biologist</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Pathway engineering: design proper metabolic pathways while taking into account several criteria such as thermodynamic feasibility, material competition of heterologous reactions, atom conservation, toxicity of intermediates. </SPAN><SPAN class="detail">2. For environmentalist</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Find proper Microorganism to make some harmful substances degrade. The purpose is to be helpful to improve the environment.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">3. For chemist</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Find more reliable and convenient path to synthesis target compound (cell-free synthetic biology)</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">4. For drug researcher</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">By using our software, researchers can study the small molecular drug and explore new pathway to synthesize it</SPAN>

To be continued ...<SPAN class="question">Q2: Are there any safety problem of biobricks in Alpha Ant we need to concern about?</SPAN>
Alpha Ant: 
<SPAN class="detail">We provide users with enzyme gene information of Biobricks, including sequence information and physiochemical characteristics. The core idea is to design proper and efficient pathway and recommend mainly enzyme gene for users’ need. Consequently, users can get gene information. After that, they can design new biobricks or search existing one by their own. </SPAN><SPAN class="question">Q3:  What about chassis cell? Since your software can recommend chassis cell for users, have you ever think about safety of your chassis cell?</SPAN>
Alpha Ant:  
<SPAN class="detail">In our microorganism recommendation system, we only recommend common used organism in iGEM and organisms in iGEM white list(link). We want ensure the biosafety of our project and people who use our software.</SPAN><SPAN class="question">Q4:  How many compounds and enzyme genes do you have in your software project?</SPAN><SPAN class="fig">Fig. 7. Data comparison among Alpha Ant, Gil and KEGG.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">As data shows above, we have more data than Gil and almost cover all KEGG reaction,compound data. Besides, we have 630275 gene data, same as KEGG while Gil only have 1950 E.coli K12 gene information.</SPAN><SPAN class="question">Q5: Do users have any way to access your data, or change data without any limitations?</SPAN>
Alpha Ant:  
<SPAN class="detail">Our data has a very neat format, mostly dictionary format. They are all stored in excel files. Users can simply search metabolic pathway in the browser and don’t need to download any files to use our software. So it’s quite convenient for them. Generally, users can not change our data in web client. But they can contact us and exchange suggestions. By the way, full data can be downloaded in github(link).</SPAN><SPAN class="question">Statement</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">We provide Alpha Ant as a public service. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) about you when you visit our Web site. Alpha Ant is only for academic research and will be not for any commercial uses.
