Differences make the team integrated. Some of us were best friends before iGEM 2018. Some of us didn’t even meet. We are from various majors, biology, biotechnology, bioinformatics, computer engineering &amp; design.</B></SPAN><SPAN class="detail"><B>Since we only have seven team members, each of us has made great difference in our project.</B></SPAN><SPAN class="h1" id="member">

Joining iGEM and developing Alpha Ant is like an adventure for me, which is full of surprises and difficulties. The joy, experience and friendship I got matter most. </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><DIV class="flip-3d"><FIGURE><B>Xiaotian Yu</B><SPAN class="top">Bioinformatics</SPAN><FIGCAPTION> In this project, I’m in charge of modeling, data analyzing. Thanks to iGEM for this opportunity to cooperate with my creative and reliable teammates. I hope that our software will play a significant role in metabolic pathway design in the future!</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><DIV class="flip-3d"><FIGURE><B>Haiyan He</B><SPAN class="top">Biology</SPAN><FIGCAPTION>I enjoy the process of turning my ideas into reality! That’s why I’m in Tongji-Software. Also, it's great to work with a bunch of imaginative and creative friends. By the way, I 'm studying  German this year. Hope to learn more about Germany culture !</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><DIV class="flip-3d"><FIGURE><B>Zhichao Ma</B><SPAN class="top">Bioinformatics</SPAN><FIGCAPTION> I’m really interested in synthetic biology. At the same time, I am proficient in programming because my major is bioinformatics. I’d love to improve my ability and develop my teamwork ability during iGEM competition. I truely hope that our software can benefit everyone.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><DIV class="flip-3d"><FIGURE><B>Yuchan Xing</B><SPAN class="top">Digital Media &amp; Communication Design</SPAN><FIGCAPTION> iGEM provides me with the opportunity to practice my skills with a group of enthusiastic contemporaries. In our team, I am mainly responsible for web design, which is not very easy for me, and therefore I got well trained!</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><DIV class="flip-3d"><FIGURE><B>Yuejia Li</B><SPAN class="top">Industrial Design</SPAN><FIGCAPTION>This is a challenge for me to help raise up a team’s image through the visual identity and interface design. I am always fond of exploring the possibilities in the inter-discipline. I believe that iGEM has offered me the chance to make it more realistic this time!</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><SPAN class="blank">
