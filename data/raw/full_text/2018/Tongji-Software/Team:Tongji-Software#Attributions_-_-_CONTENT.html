        What makes Alpha Ant meaningful and wonderful is those people’s great work.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">Since we are from different majors, all things can be covered by everyone of us. More information about team members could be found in <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tongji-Software/Team" target="_blank">Team</A>. Generally, we have three main sessions: biology logic thinking and investigation, programming and modeling, design.</SPAN><SPAN class="detail">It’s more like a workflow. At first, everyone is engaged in previous biology research and decide to do a topic about pathway design. Secondly, biology group try to get access to different database and deliver data to programming group. Then data processing and main part programming are followed. At last, design group can figure out how to show our software reasonably and wiki design.</SPAN><SPAN class="h1" id="Overview">
