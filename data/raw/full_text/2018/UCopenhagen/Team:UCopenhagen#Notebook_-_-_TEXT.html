Pilot experiment ‚Äì 11/09/18
Decision was made to use D-Sorbitol instead of Manitole
The overnight cultured cells were spun down  at 3000rpm, for 10 min at 35C. Supernatant removed.
5mL MgM-MES (pH5.0), Chloramphenicol, L-arabinose and IPTG were added to the bacterial pellet and resuspended by vortexing.cells were culteured at 37C, shaking at 200rpm for 4 hours.
While cultures were incubating, onion sheets were prepared using this protocol
When cultures had incubated we spun down the culture at 3000rpm, for 10 min at 25C, supernatant was removed
Pellet was resuspended with 2 ml of MgM-MES (pH5.0) containing 0.4 M Mannitol and spun down at  3000rpm, for 10 min at 25C, supernatant was removed. This was repeated 3 times.
Pellet was resuspended with 2 ml of MgM-MES (pH5.0) containing 0.4 M Sorbitol, chloramphenicol, L-arabinose and IPTG.
Light absorbance was measured at 600nm using a spectrophotometer and the concentration of cells was adjusted to ŒîOD600 = 0.06 by diluting with the same medium mentioned above.
To infect the onion cells 500ul of the culture fluid was put onto the pre-treatd onion cell-sheets. The whole thing was left at room temperature. We made two samples for each culture, one was left for 2 hours the other one was left overnight
Cells were observed under a fluorescent microscope

Onion preparation‚Äì 25/09/18
7 Fresh epidermal sheets of onion cells were cut out and put on microscope-slides
The onion cell sheets were attached to the microscope slide with agarose
A solution containing 1% Cellulase, 0.1%Pectolyase, 0.4M Sorbiltole-D and MgM-MES buffer, was put onto the onion sheets
1 sample was a control with no solution, the rest(6) were observed after 10min, 20min and 45min(duplicates were made for each time interval), under a microscope to see how the onion cells changed according to the incubation time of the enzymes
t=0
T=20
t=45
There were no conclusive results, might be because the incubation time was too short, the buffers were old or the enzymes did not work as suspected
Further preparation of onion sheets and tobacco plant observations‚Äì 27/09/18
New buffers and solutions were made:
1 liter MgM-MES buffer,
500ml 0.4M Sorbitol-D solution in  MgM-MES buffer,
50ml of 1%Cellulase and 0.2% pectolyase in a 0.4M Sorbitol-D solution in MgM-MES
7 Fresh epidermal sheets of onion cells were cut out and put on microscope-slides
The onion cell sheets were attached to the microscope slide with agarose
A solution containing 1% Cellulase, 0.1%Pectolyase, 0.4M Sorbiltol-D and MgM-MES buffer, was put onto the onion sheets
1 sample was a control with no solution, the rest(6) were observed after 10min, 20min and 60min(duplicates were made for each time interval), under a microscope to see how the onion cells changed according to the incubation time of the enzymes
A single tobacco plant was obtained for the purpose of trying to observe protoplasts
The cuticule was scraped off as best as possible
A solution containing 1% Cellulase, 0.1%Pectolyase, 0.4M Sorbiltol-D and MgM-MES buffer, was put into a petri dish, the piece of leaf without it¬¥s cuticle was put on top of the solution and left there for an hour
The treatment was done on a big leaf from the plant, a smaller leaf, and a tiny leaf, to see of there was any visible difference in amount of protoplasts
The leafs and its solution were observed under through a microscope which revealed burst cells and very few protoplast
Osmolarity test on  onion sheets and tobacco plant ‚Äì 02/10/18
We had been using 0.4M solution of Sorbitol through the entire experiment so we decided to test different concentrations, to see if it made any difference. We decided furthermore to switch from Sorbitol to Mannitol since a new batch of mannitol just arrived
A 12 well culture plate was obtained. Each well was filled with a solution containing MgM-MES buffer, 0.1% pectolyase, 1%cellulase and Mannitol in 9 different concentrations ranging from 0.4M-0.8M.
The cuticle of the tobacco leaves were scraped of and but downside-down into each of the wells
The first 9 wells contained 0.4;0.45;0.5;0.55;0.6;0.65;0.7;0.75 and 0.8 M Mannitol,respectively, plus the MgM-MES and enzymes. The last three contained onion cell sheets in 0.6,0.7 and 0.8 M Mannitol with the solution mentioned above.
Samples were taken after 3 hours and looked at under a fluorescent microscope.
We saw tobacco protoplasts in most samples but the sample with the highest concentration protoplast appeared to be the one containing 0.6-0.65 M of Mannitol
From looking at the onion cells, they appeared to be best treated with a 0.8M of Mannitol
We decided to move forward with 0.6M Mannitol for the tobacco leaves and 0.8M for the Onion cells
Onion and tobacco assay ‚Äì 05/10/18
8/9/18 - Stephanie & Eirikur
Onion assay pilot experiment:
Delayed due to missing Mannitol
Spin down the cultured cells at 3000rpm, for 10 min at 35C. Remove supernatant.
Add 5mL MgM-MES (pH5.0), Chloramphenicol, L-arabinose and IPTG to the bacterial pellet. Resuspend it using vortex mixer. Culture cells at 37C, shaking at 200rpm for 4 hours. This step is required because genes encoding salmonella T3SS are expressed in acidic environment.
While cultures are incubating, prepare onion sheets:
Cut an onion into four pieces.
Take out a fresh sheets of epidermal cells (second or third layer from the surface of onion).
Cut the layer into rectangular shape (about 1.5cm x 3cm)
Tear off a cell sheet from the inner surface of the layer.
Put the sheet onto a slide glass at back face up because the upper face deflects enzyme solution, and fix the edge of the sheet onto slide glass with 1% agarose gel.
Fill a petri dish with 1% cellulase and 0.1% pectolyase in 0.4 M Mannitol solution (pH7.0), then submerge the cell sheet fixed on slide glass into the enzyme solution. Incubate for 8 min at RT.
Prepare 3 petri dishes filled with MgM-MES pH5.0 containing 0.4 M Mannitol. After processing, wash cells stepwise soaking in these petri dishes to remove enzyme solution.
Remove excess moisture, and transfer the sample to another petri dish for infection.
Spin down the culture fluid at 3000rpm, for 10 min at 25C. Remove supernatant.
Resuspend the pellet with 2 ml of MgM-MES (pH5.0) containing 0.4 M Mannitol, then spin down the culture fluid at 3000rpm, for 10 min at 25C. Remove supernatant. Repeat this step 3 times. (This is done to remove the toxic substances that are produced by E. coli and adjust the osmotic pressure to that in onion cells)
Resuspend the pellet with 2 ml of MgM-MES (pH5.0) containing 0.4 M Mannitol, Tetracycline, chloramphenicol and L-arabinose.
Measure the light absorbance at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer, then adjust the concentration of cells to ŒîOD600 = 0.06 by diluting with the same medium mentioned above.
To infect onion cells with E. coli add 500 ul of the culture fluid onto pre-treated onion cell-sheets. Leave at RT in petri dish (Prevent drying)
Remove the bacterial culture fluid carefully by micropipette so that the cell-sheets are not to be torn. Observe the cells under a fluorescencent microscope.

Week 41
Washing protoplasts to remove bacteria ‚Äì 11/10/18
We needed to separate bacteria from protoplasts to use a fluorescent microscope to check for secretion into protoplasts. It turned out washing by spinning down protoplasts, removing supernatant containing bacteria and resuspending pellet was an inefficient way to do this.

Note: Only the onion protoplast samples were used
Mix samples gently by flicking
Centrifuge for 3 min at 150 RCF (or until pellet appear)
Remove supernatant
Resuspend pellet in 200 microliter 0,8 M mannitole buffer
Check samples in microrscope to ensure protoplast are stable and kept in sample
All samples were washed 6 times by following step 1-4
Note: This wasn't sufficient to remove bacteria entirely
Note: Protoplast seemed to shrink during the time of the experiment
Check samples in fluorescent microscope
Using Lyzozyme to remove bacteria ‚Äì 11/10/18
We wanted to see if digesting the bacteria would be more efficient than washing the samples. This experiment showed that separating protoplast from bacteria was innificient.

Making lipid film stocks 1 ‚Äì 29/08/18
In order to make the liposomes for later experiments quickly and to ensure that the liposomes have the same composition, we made lipid film stocks from a lipid mastermix.
First, we weighed about 25 mg of powdered lipids.

Lipids were dissolved in 1 mL chloroform.
To properly store the lipids, we used nitrogen flow to exchange air in the glass vials with nitrogen. Because some of the solvent evaporated during preparation due to the nitrogen flow, the lipid film stocks had to be redone 31/08/18.
Second, we preparred biotin stock 2. The biotin stock concentration was 0.5 Œºg/ŒºL (stock 1). 150 ŒºL of biotin stock 1 was added to 600 ŒºL chloroform to make biotin stock 2 (0.1 Œºg/ŒºL).
Selma and Lasse
Microscope tryout ‚Äì 30/08/18
We got an introduction to the microscope and saw our bacteria in the microscope for the first time. We used the confocal microscope in Associate Professor Nikos Hatzakis' laboratory. Introduction to the microscope was kindly performed by S√∏ren Schmidt-Rasmussen.
Bacteria incubation
We added 20 ŒºL of glycerol stock from the 27/08/18 to 5 mL LB media with CAM in 50 mL falcon tubes (SIEC and SIECŒîp1 with GFP, BBa_I20270).
Put in incubator at 37¬∞C at 130 rpm for 3 hours.
Preparation of supported lipid bilayer
Supported lipid bilayer was made as described in the Moran-Mirabel protocol , step 8 to 12. For this first tryout, we used the liposomes made 12/07/18 (not right membrane composition). Microscopy slides were washed with Tris buffer. Membrane contained the dye Atto655.
Microscopy
Microscope slides were washed with the same media as used for cultivation of the bacteria. 100 ŒºL bacteria culture was added to a slide well. We used lasers of 488 nm and 635 for excitation. FRAP was used to see if the membrane was intact, which was not the case.

Full protocol tryout 1 ‚Äì 12/09/18
We inoculated colonies from plates that were made the 05/09/18 in LB media with arabinose (1%), IPTG (0.1 mM) and CAM (34 Œºg/mL). The cultures were incubated for 2.5 hours at 37 ¬∞C 160 rpm. Meanwhile lipid films were rehydrated, extruded through a 200 nm filter and underwent 10 cycles of freezing in nitrogen and heating in a water bath, see Liposome preparation protocol . Liposomes were used to make a supported lipid bilayer on a microscope slide. The rest of the liposomes were kept in -80 ¬∞C freezer.
After 2.5 hours of incubation, we measured OD of the bacterial culture (results below) and pipetted 100 uL of bacteria culture onto each slide with bilayer. This was incubated at 37 ¬∞C in 3 hours.
After incubation, we looked at each slide in the microscope, taking pictures before and after washing with 100 uL media 3 times.

Manufacturing the chamber and testing the setup ‚Äì 24-26/08/18
The polystyrene plastic cup (PS) was found to be the most appropriate material for our setup.
Small holes were made at the bottom of the upper cup with heated nail
Membrane was placed across the holes, left to settle and fixed with wax
The next step was testing the leakiness of the setup. Cups were filled with water up to 2 cm and left for 24h. Upon any sign of leakiness the membrane was discarded.

Week 35
Manufacturing the chamber and testing the setup2 ‚Äì  1-2/09/18
Upon further testing the simple "gluing" the membrane with universal glue was found to be superior in comparison to "waxing".
Same testing for leakines was performed with similar amount of water and therefore hydrostatic pressure.
It was found out that letting the membres dry even for 1h causes leakiness upon further testing for leakiness. All leaky membranes were discarded.
4 membranes that passed all the tests were stored in a plastic box with wet tissue to preserve the humidity and prevent drying of the membranes.
Week 36
Preparing the bacteria ‚Äì  6/09/18
For preliminary experiments the following strains of SIEC bacteria were used:
(All had chaperones and mCherry as a reporter protein)
numbering
Genetic material
Description
1.
I+, S+, C+
Fully functional strain
2.
I-,S+,C+
Strain with disabled injectisome
3.
I+,S-,C+
Strain with injectosome but without secretion signal
Legend:
I = injectosome, (+) means functional injectosome, while (-) means the plasmid is lacking promoter in front DNA that in encoding injectisome.
S = secretion signal, a sequence of 20 amino acids which is believed to provide selectivity when it comes to secretion via injectosome.
C = chaperone. In this experiment all strains had chaperone. It is believed that they facilitate unfolding of the protein prior to injecting, however we tried to validate this in some other experiments.
Strains were picked from the araginoze plates and and overnight culture was grown in 10mL of LB media + Chloramphenicol.
Incubated overnight at 28¬∞C  since the other incubator was broken (for 37¬∞C)
Incubation‚Äì  7/09/18
After measuring OD600 of overnight cultures the calculated amount of arabinose and IPTG was added to get the final concentration of 1% (w/w%) for arabinose and 1mM for IPTG. After incubating for 2h at 28¬∞C (the 37¬∞C incubator was still out of function) the bacteria solution was poured over membrane (without centrifugation) so that the upper chamber was filled approximately to the half (5mL of culture).
