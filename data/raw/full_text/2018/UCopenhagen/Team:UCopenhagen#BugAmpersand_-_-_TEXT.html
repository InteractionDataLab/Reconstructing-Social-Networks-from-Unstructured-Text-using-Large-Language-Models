This block of code is rendered by the wiki system as the following block.

Why?
Make sure all wiki content is hosted on 2018.igem.org. (This includes text, files, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other scripts.)
Don't host your wiki or parts of your wiki elsewhere. Don't include scripts or stylesheets from other                         servers.
iGEM content is preserved on our servers so future teams can learn from what you've done. When content                         is stored on other sites/servers, links may become broken, sites may go down, and information will be lost.
Load your CSS and Javascript into the wiki, either directly into your page or using templates.
Don't try to host your CSS and Javascript on a third party server
You are required to host all content on the iGEM servers (see above)
With this fatal bug, we can't directly use internal JS scripts and CSS styles. We're still able to put them on the             iGEM servers, as required, by following the guide below.
External JS hosted on iGEM Server
You may put your code as is on a new page.
For example, see  https://2018.igem.org/Template:UCopenhagen/js/bugAmpersand
Add ?action=raw&ctype=text/javascript, for JS script, or ?action=raw&ctype=text/css, for CSS style, to the end of the URL earlier Ref 1 .
For example,  https://2018.igem.org/Template:UCopenhagen/js/bugAmpersand?action=raw&ctype=text/javascript
Load the script on the desired destination page as an external script.
For example,
 <script src="https://2018.igem.org/Template:UCopenhagen/js/bugAmpersand?action=raw&ctype=text/javascript"></script>
Now the external JS script is hosted on the iGEM server, ...
