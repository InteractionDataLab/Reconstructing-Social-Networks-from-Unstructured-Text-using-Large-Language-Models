Adamkindly helped us by answering our questions regarding biotech development in the space industry. Adam was also very nice and forwarded our mail to other experts that we could be interested in speaking with.  
</P><P><STRONG>Alessandra Luchini</STRONG>, PhD, Postdoc at Lise Arleth's group at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen. Alessandra met with members of our wet lab team and helped brainstorming what artificial planar membrane-technology we could use in our experiments.
</P><P><STRONG>Birger Lindberg Møller, </STRONG>Professor and Head of the Center for Synthetic Biology, University of Copenhagen. We really appreciate that Professor Birger Lindberg Møller, as head of the Center for Synthetic Biology, provided us with a letter of recommendation for our funding applications. 
</P><P><STRONG>Eva Horn Møller, </STRONG>PhD,Senior Drug Product Specialist at Zealand Pharma A/S. We had a very fruitful discussion with Eva Horn Møller regarding our project. Eva highlighted the importance of having the patient and his/her safety in mind. She further pointed out that we need to take special care to determine what that might be secreted in our system  in addition to our protein of choice. She suggested that we could use a special <EM>E. coli </EM>strain with disabled lipopolysaccharide. These are all ideas that we intend to incorporate into our project. Eva also suggested that working on smaller, non-glycosylated peptides – including antibody fragments – may be the best way to go. 
</P><P><STRONG>Lise Arleth</STRONG>, Professor in structural biophysics at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen. Lise answered our initial questions about artificial membranes, which helped guiding the development of our membrane-focused experiments. She also put us in contact with Dr. Alessandra Luchini.
</P><P><STRONG>Luis Ángel Fernández Herrero</STRONG>, PhD, Principal Investigator, National Center for Biotechnology (CNB) Madrid, Spain. Luis sent us the bacterial strain that we used in all our experiments and for this we are very thankful. 
</P><P><STRONG>Jacob Hofman-Bang, </STRONG>PhD, Senior Scientist, Centre for Biosecurity and Biopreparedness. We contacted Jacob in order to hear about the biosafety aspects of our project. Jacob made a very good analysis of our product and concluded that in the form it has right now there are no biosafety issues. 
</P><P><STRONG>Jon Fugl,</STRONG> Research Assistant, Section for Plant Biochemistry, University of Copenhagen. Jon helped us in the laboratory and gave us useful inputs throughout the project.
</P><P><STRONG>Jon Scott, </STRONG>PhD, Medical Projects Team Lead, Space Medicine Office, European Astronaut Centre. Jon told us that there is an interest in combining exercise with anabolic drugs such as PTH, GH, and IGF-1, in order to improve the effect of exercise. Furthermore, there are some drawbacks with exercise in space as it is right now such as, 1) it is time consuming, 2) not all astronauts like to do it, 3) it produces heat, CO<SUB>2</SUB> and moisture and 4) it increases the consumption of food. Jon also mentioned that proteins that can be used for diagnosis and for research purposes during space travel also would be very useful to produce with our system.
</P><P><STRONG>Jozef Mravec, </STRONG>Assistant professor, Section for Plant Glycobiology, University of Copenhagen. Jozef has helped us to perform experiments with the confocal microscope in the laboratory.
</P><P><STRONG>Jørgen Sauer, </STRONG>PhD, Fermentation Scientist from Novo Nordisk. Jørgen gave us some very interesting and useful feedback on our project. We spoke with him about several aspects of our project both safety, design and technical aspects of protein production.   
</P><P><STRONG>Jane Nøhr</STRONG>, PhD, Cluster Manager at Biopeople, Denmark's Life Science Cluster. Jane provided us with very useful inputs concerning both the project and the current protein production processes in industry. Jane drew our attention to the current way of protein production in the industry using <EM>Pichia pastoris. </EM>Jane also suggested us to pay special attention to yield and purity when developing our product.
</P><P><STRONG>Kirsten Jørgensen</STRONG>, Associate Professor, Work Environment Coordinator, and Vice Head for Teaching at the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Copenhagen.

Furthermore, she provided us with a letter of recommendation that was useful for our funding applications. 
</P><P><STRONG>Karen McDonald, </STRONG>PhD, Professor at Department of Chemical Engineering, UC Davis. We got into contact with Karen through CUBES. We discussed the biomedical aspects of the proteins that we want to produce for space travel and she gave us some very valuable inputs. Karen said that the 2.5 hours of exercise per day (which is the standard right now for astronauts) might be difficult for long term space explorations and therefore some drugs would potentially be very useful when facing this problem. Karen McDonald's research group are working on producing the protein drug PTH (parathyroid hormone) in a way that is suitable for space travel. Karen McDonald also mentioned anti-cancer drugs as something that would be very useful to produce during long term space travel. 
</P><P><STRONG>Lonnie Grove, </STRONG>PhD, Postdoc atUniversity of Copenhagen and Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of California San Diego. Lonnie was one of the first experts we talked with and she help us understand the general health issues that arise during space travel. Lonnie said that production of antibodies would be useful for space travel.
</P><P><STRONG>Lynn Rotschield, </STRONG>PhD, Senior Research Scientist, Bio and Bio-Inspired Technologies, Research and Technology Lead for NASA HQ STMD.Lynn visited us in Copenhagen in the Spring.
