Presenting the team
iGEM team Copenhagen is a very mixed group of people, both in terms of age, gender, nationality and competencies - a diversity we have embraced and taken into account by making a team contract that states expectations from team members. We were assembled in March and spent our first day together competing in building towers from spaghetti and marshmallows - the best start to a team!
After the spaghetti, we went straight to core values - a continuous discussion taking place over several weeks. We decided that we wanted to make a product that was useful, and we wanted to investigate all potential downsides before making a choice - that have been and are the most important values for all of us.
