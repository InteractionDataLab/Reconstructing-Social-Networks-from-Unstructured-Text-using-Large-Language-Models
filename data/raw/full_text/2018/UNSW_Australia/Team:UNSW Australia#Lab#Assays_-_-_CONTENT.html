Assays were designed to measure the presence of tryptophan (initial reactant), indole-3-acetamide (IAM, the intermediate reactant) and IAA (product). 
As a simple, fast, and inexpensive test we used a Salkowski assay, previous described by iGEM Imperial College London 2011, which measured levels of IAA production over time. 
An HPLC assay was additionally used to gather more detailed data about the relative abundance of each of the reactants and products over a given time period.</P></DIV><H2>Introduction</H2><P>IAA biosynthesis was selected as our candidate pathway for investigating the performance of our Assemblase scaffold. The IAA biosynthesis pathway involves the conversion of tryptophan to indole-3-acetamide by the enzyme IaaM, followed by conversion to IAA by the enzyme IaaH <B>(Figure 1)</B>. In order to examine the performance of the IaaM and IaaH enzymes in our Assemblase scaffolding system compared to when they are free in solution, it was necessary to set up assays to quantify reaction turnover. To this aim, we established the Salkowski assay and HPLC in our lab. These assays allow us to determine the relative abundance of each of the reactants and final product in the IAA production pathway.</P><P class="figure-legend"><B>Figure 1: </B>The indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis pathway.</P><H2>Aim</H2><P>Our aim was to be able to determine the relative abundance of each of the reactants and final product in the IAA production pathway. In doing so, we hoped to evaluate the effectiveness of our scaffold by comparing the quantity of IAA produced by the scaffolded enzymes with the quantity of IAA produced by the non-scaffolded enzymes over a certain time period. Over the same time period, we expected a greater quantity of IAA to be detected when employing the scaffolded enzymes. </P><H2>Salkowski Assay</H2><P>The Salkowski assay is a colourimetric assay that detects IAA in solution. This simple assay was therefore useful to compare IAA production by unscaffolded veruses Assemblase-scaffolded IaaM and IaaH enzymes. We first performed the Salkowski assay on standards prepared from commercially available IAA.

Salkowski assays to determine how readily the purified enzyme IaaH converted IAM to IAA showed us that the Salkowski reagent is not able to differentiate between the two molecules <B>(Figure 6)</B>.

The mixture passes through a column packed with an adsorbent material, which causes different flow rates for the different components of the mixture. We present a method to prepare the supernatant from lysed cells containing the enzymes. This allows for the measurement of the 3 key intermediaries using HPLC; tryptophan, indole acetamide, indole acetic acid. HPLC enables measurement of these intermediaries with greater sensitivity than the Salkowski assay and is able to distinguish between indole acetamide and indole acetic acid.</P><OL><LI>Acidify supernatant with 5M HCl to pH 2.5.</LI><LI>Extract supernatant with an equal volume of ethyl acetate.</LI><LI>Evaporate off the solvent by drying it through a vacuum (or leave it to evaporate).</LI><LI>Dissolve in methanol &amp; acetic acid (pH 4.5)

Our Salkowski assay standard curve for IAA concentration generated an R<SUP>2</SUP> value of 0.994. Unfortunately our results using IaaM and IaaH expressing bacterial cell pellets and supernatant were inconclusive due to contamination of the control sample (Figures 4 and 5). Further Salkowski assays to determine how readily purified enzyme IaaH converted IAM to IAA showed us that the Salkowski reagent is not able to differentiate between the two molecules (Figure 6). From this, we learnt that a more precise assay was required and so we opted to perform HPLC.</P><P>HPLC analysis produced far more accurate standard curves for IAA (R<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.999), and very accurate curves for IAM (R<SUP>2</SUP> = 1.000) and tryptophan (R<SUP>2</SUP> = 1.000). HPLC allowed analysis of all three intermediates with one analysis, and has the potential to measure a changing concentration of these intermediates. Given the high quality and accuracy of standard results produced in the initial HPLC standards, more accurate analysis would provide little benefit as an assay for IAA. </P><H2>Future direction</H2><P>Further analysis of the changing concentration of IAA in IaaM/IaaH expressing cells incubated with tryptophan by HPLC could verify the potential of the enzymes to produce IAA from tryptophan. HPLC could then be used again, on scaffolded IaaM/IaaH incubated in the same conditions to determine any effect scaffolding these enzymes has on changing the rate of overall reaction in the IAA synthesis pathway.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
