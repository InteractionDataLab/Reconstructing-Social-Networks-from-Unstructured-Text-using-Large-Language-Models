Parts
Phusion PCR amplification of aPFD-SpyC, bPFD-SnoopC and IaaM-SnoopT Gblocks (provided by IDT) performed.
However primers were diluted to 100uM rather than 10uM so  the PCR amplification was unsuccessful. Performed PCR amplification of Gblocks again, however extra bands on gel indicated non-specific binding of primers. We decided to generate inserts by restriction enzyme digest of already cloned pET-Duet and pRSF plasmids in future attempts.
Week 21
17th September - 23rd September
Cloning
We made a decision to switch plasmid vectors for our cloning experiments, using pET-19b instead of pETDuet-1/pRSFDuet-1. DNA constructs were PCR amplified using a new set of primers, which would allow the inserts to be cloned into the new vector.
