Assembly
Catcher and Tag Assembly
Purified IaaH fused to SpyTag (IaaH-SpyTag) and prefoldin proteins fused to SpyCatcher (aPFD-SpyCatcher, gPFD-SpyCatcher and SpyCatcher-gPFD-SpyCatcher) were obtained.

TEM
Materials
Protein sample (ideally in water or low salt buffer)
Milli-Q water
2 % uranyl acetate
Parafilm
Self-closing forceps
Staining
Glow discharge the carbon-coated grids (carbon-coated side up) to render them hydrophilic.
Place the grids (carbon-coated side up) on parafilm.
Place 7 µL of sample on a grid.
Let the grid stain for 10 minutes.
Using a pasteur pipette, transfer 5 droplets of Milli-Q water on a piece parafilm (for each grid).
After the 10 minutes of staining, pick up grid with the forceps and wash residue salts by passing the grid through the five droplets of water.
In a fume hood, place one droplet of 2 % uranyl acetate on a piece of parafilm (for each grid).
Wear appropriate PPE to handle uranium; do not work with uranium outside the fume hood.
Place the grid on the uranyl acetate drop (carbon-coated side down) and stain for 5-7 minutes.
Pick the grid up with the forceps.
Remove excess uranyl acetate by touching one side of the grid with filter paper for a few seconds, then briefly touch the other side of the grid with the filter paper.
Let the grid dry for a few minutes before transferring back it to its box.
The grid can be fully dried in a oven if imaging the sample the next day, or just left in the box until imaging.

Sample to working reagent ratio =  1:8
96-well plate reader: SPECTROstar Nano BMG LABTECH
Software used: SPECTROstar Nano
Salkowski Assay
The Salkowski assay is a measurement-based protocol used to assess the quantity of indole-3-acetic acid within a sample. This particular protocol has been adapted from the methods used by 2011 iGEM Imperial College London , Tang and Bonner’s 1947 paper3, and Glickmann and Dessaux's 1995 paper4.
Cellular Protocol
Pick a single colony of untransformed T7 and transformed T7 and inoculate a 2-5ml overnight culture in LB.
Add antibiotics to the transformed culture.
The next day, add 50 mL of LB + 2.5 mg/mL tryptophan to a 250 mL shake flask labelled “Control”.
Add 50 mL of LB + 2.5 mg/mL tryptophan + antibiotic to another baffled shake flask labelled “IAA”.
Add 1 mL of the respective overnight cultures to each flask. Incubate with shaking (200 rpm) at 37°C. Sample at 1h, 4h, 7h and 20-24h.
For each sample: a. Measure the OD at 600 nm.
Spin down 1 mL. Retain pellet and freeze. Retain supernatant and store at 4°C. Label these 4.
The next day:  Add Salkowski reagent to supernatants at the ratio of 1 mL per 0.5 mL of supernatant. Incubate in the dark for 30 minutes.
Add 1 mL of Salkowski reagent to each cell pellet.
Vortex to mix.
Incubate in the dark for 30 minutes.
Centrifuge at full speed for 5 minutes.
Measure the absorbance at 530 nm Measure appropriate controls as well.
Normalise readings at each time point against OD600.
The assay is performed by adding the Salkowski reagent to a prepared sample:
To prepare the Salkowski assay reagent, slowly add 95 % H2SO4 to Milli-Q water in a ratio of 3:2, allowing time for heat dissipation between additions.
Dissolve 4.5 g/L of anhydrous FeCl3 into the solution. Store in the dark, wrapped in foil.
Prepare the standard by using a 3 mM stock, then diluted 1 in 10 for usage – with 300 µM to 0 µM concentrations.
Prepare a standard curve.
Samples are run by adding the sample (or standard) to the Salkowski reagent in a ratio of 1:2 in a time sensitive manner within a 96-well microtitre plate.
Run the plate on a plate reader for absorbance at 530 nm, after being left for 30 minutes in the dark.

Plants
Seed Surface Sterilisation
Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were surface sterilised by mixing in a solution of 2.5 % sodium hypochlorite with a drop of Tween for 10 minutes.
Seeds were subsequently washed eight times in sterile water.
Indole-3-acetic Acid Filter Sterilisation
10 mM stock indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was prepared by dissolving indole-3-acetic acid sodium salt purchased from Sigma Aldrich in ethanol.
In a laminar flow hood, the solution was filter sterilised through a 0.22 µm Millex® syringe driven filter and stored at 4°C in a foil covered container to protect from light.
MS Agar Plate Preparation
Murashige and Skoog (MS) media was prepared using M5519 MS basal powdered medium purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
In four separate Schott bottles, 250 mL of MS media was prepared using 1.1 g of MS basal salts (per manufacturer instructions) and Milli-Q purified water.
Each mixture was supplemented with sucrose (1 % w/v) and agar powder (0.8 % w/v) and adjusted to pH 5.7 using KOH.
Mixtures were autoclaved and allowed to cool to approximately 50°C (or until able to be held comfortably).
Cooled bottles were transferred to a dark laminar flow hood where indole-3-aecetic acid solution was added to prepare four separate MS agar mixtures at 0 µM, 1 µM, 10 µM and 100 µM concentrations IAA respectively.
In a dark laminar flow hood, 50 mL of media was pipetted into a square plate using a serological pipette. Four 50 mL plates were prepared for each concentration of IAA.
Plates were labelled, sealed with parafilm and stored wrapped in foil at 4°C until further use.
Liquid Culture Media Preparation
MS media was prepared using M5519 MS basal powdered medium purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
In an autoclavable Schott bottle, 500 mL 1/2 MS media was prepared using 1.1 g of MS basal salts and 500 ml of Milli-Q purified water (4.4 g salts equivalent to 1 L MS media per manufacturer’s instructions).
Media was supplemented with sucrose (1 % w/v) and adjusted to pH 5.7 using KOH.
Media was autoclaved and stored at room temperature until further use.
Arabidopsis thaliana Growth on Agar Plates
Surface sterilised seeds were added to a flask containing an autoclaved solution of Milli-Q water with 1 % w/v sucrose in a laminar flow hood.
This flask was covered with foil and seeds were stratified at 4°C for two days.
Stratified seeds were then allowed to germinate under light at room temperature for 2 days.
In a dark laminar flow hood, seedlings were transplanted to MS media plates with varying concentrations of IAA. Approximately five seedlings were transplanted per plate using sterile tweezers and loops. Seedlings were arranged in a line, 2 cm from the top of each plate. Three plates with seedlings were prepared for each concentration.
Plates were sealed with parafilm and covered with foil leaving only the top 2 cm exposed in order to limit IAA photodegradation and simulate the natural growth conditions of higher plants whereby only shoots are exposed to illumination5. Plates were stored upright at an approximately 90° angle. The plated seedlings were grown under light at room temperature for 20 days.
Primary root length and lateral root numbers were measured at 4, 6, 11 and 20 days following the initial seedling transplant.
Arabidopsis thaliana Liquid Culture
In a laminar flow hood, 25 mL of 1/2 MS media with 1 % sucrose was aliquoted into twelve 50 mL foil wrapped falcon tubes.
Filter sterilised IAA was added to prepare duplicate tubes at 0 nM, 1nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 µM and 10 µM concentrations of IAA.
100 µL of surface sterilised A. thaliana seeds were added to each tube.
Liquid cultures were stratified at 4°C for two days, then grown under light at room temperature for 9 days.
Three seedlings from each tube were selected at random and measured for primary root length and shoot length.
