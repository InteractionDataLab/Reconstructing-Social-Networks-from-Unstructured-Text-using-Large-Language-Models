All of the work we have conducted would not have been possible without the support we received from them. Specific references to the work done by those named below can also be found on the relevant pages with whose content they assisted with.</P><DIV id="attributions"><DIV class="overall box flex-center"><DIV class="att-text vertical-align-margin"><H3>Associate Professor Christopher Marquis</H3><H4>PI</H4><P>Chris has supported, mentored and encouraged our team throughout the past
				year. Among other things, we are especially grateful for his help in adapting methodologies to suit our needs, the troubleshooting help he has provided and his experienced guidance for both the wet lab and dry lab components. We would also like to thank him for the work he has done over the past year in securing resources and space for us to use, and for kindly allowing us to use his equipment. He has provided ongoing support with particular examples of his contribution to our project include Chris finding several speakers for our symposium and helping us use corrosive reagents for the Salkowski assay.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="overall box flex-center"><DIV class="att-text vertical-align-margin"><H3>Dr Dominic Glover</H3><H4>Secondary PI</H4><P>Dominic has also supported, mentored and encouraged our team over the year. We are particularly grateful for his help in suggesting and expressing prefoldin and letting us borrow Daniel, his lab equipment and reagents such as pET-19b. We also appreciate him sharing his area of research (prefoldin) with our team, and the many hours he spent with our team to troubleshoot our experiments. He has provided ongoing support with particular examples of his contribution to our project include helping us to express our prefoldins and helped us with the design of our Gibson overhands.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="overall box flex-center"><DIV class="att-text vertical-align-margin"><H3>Dr Daniel Winter</H3><H4>Lab Mentor</H4><P>Daniel has also supported, mentored and encouraged our team throughout the year. We are  thankful for him teaching us new molecular biological techniques, and helping us master ones we had previously used. He also helped troubleshoot our experiments, gave us general support, and ran transmission electron microscopy for us, allowing us to visualise how our structure assembles. Daniel also connected us with many of the other collaborators listed below, including Dr Donald Thomas.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="overall box flex-center"><DIV class="att-text vertical-align-margin"><H3>Jessica Mazalo</H3><H4>Mentor</H4><P>Jess has also supported, mentored and encouraged our team over the year. She attended weekly project meetings throughout the year, and provided general feedback and advice on our project's direction, as well as suggestions for troubleshooting. She assisted the team with lab experiments, particularly DNA cloning, testing protein expression, and the plant growth assays. Jess also played a role in developing the project design elements and gave feedback on our presentation style.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="overall box flex-center"><DIV class="att-text vertical-align-margin"><H3>Maddie Wainright</H3><H4>Mentor</H4><P>Maddie has also supported, mentored and encouraged our team over the year. She attended weekly project meetings and provided general feedback and advice on our project's direction. She was the primary mentor and support for the human practices team, playing an integral role in suggesting speakers for events. Maddie also mentored and advised the team regarding the use of graphic design in our project, which included her producing one of the GIFs on the wiki, and commenting on the communication style of our presentation.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="overall box flex-center"><DIV class="att-text vertical-align-margin"><H3>Shivani Shah</H3><H4>Mentor</H4><P>Shivani attended project meetings and provided general advice on our project's direction and the flow of lab work.
