We strongly believe that PNCs meet those principles and have modeled our toolkit accordingly.</P><P class="f12">Protein nanocompartments (PNCs) are a nanoscale delivery system. They are composed of proteins that self-assemble to encapsulate various forms of cargo, like nucleic acids and small molecules, and deliver their cargo to different cellular and intercellular locations. Certain PNCs are able to target where they deliver their cargo with the use of surface peptides making them not only more specific, but also more efficient and can help limit off targeting effects when using PNCs to deliver therapeutic cargo (Rahovie <I> et al.,</I> 2016). Due to their simple architecture, small size, and broad applicability, PNCs have the potential to become an extremely valuable tool for future iGEM teams and for the scientific community as well. </P><P class="f12">But where do PNCs come from? PNCs are derived from viruses. Viruses are comprised of a protein capsid, which house and transport a viral genome. In this case, the protein capsid is the PNC and the viral DNA is the cargo. However, PNCs as a cellular delivery system are not viruses! They are simply viral-inspired as they do not contain the viral genome necessary to replicate and cause harm and, in many cases, even their protein sequences have been modified for optimized delivery.  </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="oneText-Wrapper"><DIV class="oneText-Text"><CENTER><DIV style="width: 800px"><P><B>Figure 1.</B> Overview of various virus-like particles (image from Rohovie <I>et al.,</I> 2016).</P></DIV></CENTER></DIV><H1> Applications </H1><DIV class="imageBlock-Wrapper"><DIV class="imageBlock-Block"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Drug delivery:</B> PNCs with the capacity to specifically target the delivery of their cargo through aid of surface peptides have the potential to dramatically enhance drug delivery and effectiveness in therapeutics. An example of this would be to decrease harmful side effects of chemotherapeutics by targeting their delivery specifically to cancer cells. Additionally, controlling the concentration of small molecules that can enter the cell by encapsulation can help drug delivery and prevent corresponding toxicity (Whitledge <I> et al.,</I> 2015).</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="imageBlock-Wrapper"><DIV class="imageBlock-Block"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Targeted Cell Transformations and Transfections:</B> PNCs with the ability to deliver cargo into the cellular membrane of their target cell have the potential to dramatically increase the efficiency of transforming bacterial cells or transfecting eukaryotic cells with plasmid DNA or other agents (Pastuzyn <I>et al.,</I> 2018).</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="imageBlock-Wrapper"><DIV class="imageBlock-Block"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Targeted Antibiotic delivery:</B> The side effects of antibiotic use include harming the host’s endogenous “good” bacteria along with their targeted “bad” bacteria may be circumvented by using PNCs to specifically target the “bad” bacteria with antibiotics (Kaur <I>et al.,</I> 2016).</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="imageBlock-Wrapper"><DIV class="imageBlock-Block"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Vaccine development:</B> PNCs have vast potential for the use of vaccines. Attaching linker sequences and other surface modifications to the capsid, as well as encapsulating immunogenic sequences can simplify the applications and productions of vaccines (Lua <I> et al.,</I> 2015).</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="imageBlock-Wrapper"><DIV class="imageBlock-Block"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Gene therapy:</B> By encapsulating a gene editing system like CRISPR, PNCs have the potential to deliver proteins capable of genetic modification to a specific tissue or population of cells. A benefit to targeted gene therapy is that it can help avoid genetic modification to all cells or even target gamete cells (Bundy <I>et al.,</I> 2008).</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="imageBlock-Wrapper"><DIV class="imageBlock-Block"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Invasive Species/Pest Control:</B> PNCs have the potential to encapsulate a toxic agent that may be specifically targeted to a particular species or pest while preventing off target effects within the ecosystem. Partnering this technology with specific biological control agents can help to prevent invasive species introduction and limit the proliferation of pests (Whitledge <I>et al</I>, 2015).</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="imageBlock-Wrapper"><DIV class="imageBlock-Block"><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Implementation of iGEM projects:</B> Our team did an analysis of previous projects in Alberta from The University of Alberta, The University of Calgary, The University of Lethbridge, and the Lethbridge high school. Of the projects analyzed, ~25% had trouble implementing their project into the real world scenario they had designed it for. Encapsulating in protein nanocompartments would allow them to deliver their systems safely and efficiently, making their projects more successful.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><H1> Our System </H1><DIV class="textImage-Wrapper"><DIV class="textText-Text"><P class="f12">Our goal for the 2018 iGEM season was to develop a PNC toolkit for future iGEM teams and researchers which we named VINCEnT (Viral-Inspired Novel Cargo Encapsulation Toolkit). Our software tool was created in order to help individuals build PNCs that cater to their specific project needs which include surface peptides, encapsulation proteins, and specific cargo loading approaches that can be used for various applications. With these designs we can address a wide range of issues such as antibiotic resistance, the negative side-effects of chemotherapeutics, or the impact of using GMOs as biological control agents.
