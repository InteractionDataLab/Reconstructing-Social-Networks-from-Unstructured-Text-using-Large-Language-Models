The purpose of this tool is to facilitate a match between molecular cargo and cellular target and provide a protein nanocompartment recommendation as a starting point for the design of your own VINCEnT! The tool accepts user input to specify the cellular target, molecular cargo, and approximate size of the protein nanocompartment. After submitting, a recommendation will be generated and will provide a link to a datasheet with information on the PNC.

Based on your input we were to recommend for your application.
Remember, biology is a cooperative endeavour. When people aren't careful with the biology they do, it can have long lasting effects on everyone else. Accordingly, you should be very careful about encapsulating nucleic acids that are able to self-replicate or integrate into a genome. Ideally, a PNC should be used to carry single-use cargo. For instance, encapsulating a gene drive or other heritable element is strongly discouraged.
