The P22 + SP-Cas9 PNCs had a much more consistent architecture but had a diameter of 120 +/- 5nm, which is approximately twice that of typical P22 virus-like particles. The 1:1 capsid to cargo ratio may have caused overloading of the PNCs, which caused an increase in overall size.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="twoText-Wrapper"><DIV class="twoText-Text"><H2>P22 coat proteins</H2><P class="f14"><B>Figure 7.</B> TEM image (40,000X magnification) of negatively-stained self-assembled P22 capsids in the absence of scaffolding proteins.

Consensus between the Sequence and Mass spectroscopy data, is shown in the green and has a value of 68.56%. The average cover success is about 70% according to the biomolecular analysis facility at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. Therefore, our mass spectroscopy analysis was successful and can inform the P22 structure and chemical composition. More importantly it proves that from comparing to our peptide sequence data to this experimental data, we were able to express and purify P22 successfully.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="oneText-Wrapper"><H1>Analytical Ultracentrifugation of Minimal Arc Gag</H1><DIV class="oneText-Text"><P class="f14">We attempted to characterize our purified Arc-min protein with the use of sedimentation velocity data gathered through analytical ultracentrifugation. We prepared samples from both Arc-min and Arc-full, but were only able to observe any sedimentation from Arc-min. This suggests that there were insufficient amounts of Arc-full protein to run on AUC. The data that we observed for Arc-min indicate that the protein monomers aggregated which can be observed in the aggregation boundary in Figure 10 ( top left, absorbance; top right, relative intensity).(Refer to our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Lethbridge/Experiments">Experiments page</A> for more details on AUC.)</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="oneText-Wrapper"><DIV class="oneText-Text"><P class="f14"><B>Figure 10.</B> Analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation results and simulations. <B>(top left)</B> Converted relative light intensity sedimentation rates into absorbance to compare to simulations. <B>(top right)</B> AUC sedimentation rates of Arc-min (top-right) measured in intensity of light at 217 nm and spun at 30,000 rpm. <B>(bottom left)</B> Modelled expected sedimentation rates of an Arc-min monomer and <B>(bottom right)</B> hexamer.

Lanes right to left show the stages of purification from Cell pellet, Lysate, supernatant flow through, column washes, elutions and the regeneration of the column.The Purification of SPCas9 using nickel affinity chromatography was successful in terms of isolating the protein.  Although yield is low compared to the levels of protein seen in the wash samples and lysate, protein was isolated. Further purification of smaller proteins was done by using a centrifugation spin column with a molecular weight cutoff filter of 50kDa. Loss of yield is likely due to overloading the column with supernatant and not enough nickel resin on the column compared to supernatant volumes. No further purification methods were done. These samples were used for both transmission electron microscopy imaging and experiments done by the University of Calgary as found <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Calgary">here</A>.The cell expression and purification protocol used can be found <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Lethbridge/Experiments">here</A>.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="oneText-Wrapper"><DIV class="oneText-Text"><P class="f14"><B>Figure 12.</B> Purification of P22 capsid using 35% sucrose solution and ultracentrifugation.
