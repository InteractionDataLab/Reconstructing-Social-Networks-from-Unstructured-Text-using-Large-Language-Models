UNIVERSITY OF LETHBRIDGE COLLEGIATE TEAM
We are collaborating with the University of Lethbridge Collegiate Team for the 7th year in a row. The collegiate team members have assisted our project by providing us with mentorship and assistance in the lab. It was easy for us to collaborate with them as both our projects contain protein capsids from viruses, and therefore we were able to help each other design these constructs. We were also able to have connection to collegiate team members who have had previous experience with tailings ponds in their past iGEM projects, which helped our project greatly. Sydnee Calhoun, Chris Isaac, Luke Saville, and Kristi Turton, members of the collegiate team, were advisors for our team and provided valuable assistance and help for our project.
