All composite parts pages were created on the registry of standard biological parts and include capsid proteins, specific cargos and surface modifiers. All parts were designed with the same promoter ( BBa_I712074 ), medium strength Ribosomal binding site ( BBa_J61100 ) and double terminator ( BBa_B0014 ). The basic parts that make up these parts can be found here .
