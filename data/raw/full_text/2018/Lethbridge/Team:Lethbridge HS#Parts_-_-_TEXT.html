PARTS OVERVIEW
CU LATER PARTS OVERVIEW
For our project we are using parts primarily serving the function of capturing ions, holding on to them and precipitating out of solution.
This includes usage of parts taken from:
the T4 bacteriophage
Cup1 from Yeast
CutA from E. coli
elastin-like polymers (ELPs).
The regulators we are using are:
an inducible promoter induced by IPTG(BBa_I712074)
a medium-strong ribosomal-binding site(BBa_J61100)
and a double terminator(BBa_B0014)
