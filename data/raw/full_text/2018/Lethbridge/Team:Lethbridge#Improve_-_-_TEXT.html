The following constructs are improved by being cloned and confirmed to be into the pSB1C3 plasmid, thus making them able to express in E. coli and used for iGEM user applications.  Our project focuses on encapsulation of cargo by protein nanocompartments. This technology can be used to encapsulate cell free systems. The Next vivo project, designed by the Lethbridge iGEM team in 2017 is therefore an important and viable application for our toolkit. We hope in the future to try encapsulating this system as an alternative to liposome encapsulation as previously proposed for this project. The ability to target cell types could increase the cell free technology we are still developing. Additionally, we hope that cell-free synthesis of protein nanocompartments can also be accomplished using our Next vivo system
Release Factor 1
Original Part: BBa_K2443029
Submitted by: Lethbridge iGEM 2017
Designed by: iGEM17_Lethbridge
Brief description: Release factor 1 (RF1) works with release factor 2 and 3 to cause the termination of translation by recognizing the stop codon in the  mRNA sequence in question.
Release Factor 2
Original Part: BBa_K2443030
Submitted by: Lethbridge iGEM 2017
Designed by: iGEM17_Lethbridge
Brief Description: Release factor 2 (RF2) works with release factors 1 and 2 to cause the termination of translation by recognizing the stop codon in the  mRNA sequence in question.
Cysteine tRNA Synthetase
Original Part: BBa_K2443004
Submitted by: Lethbridge iGEM 2017
Designed by: iGEM17_Lethbridge
Brief description: Cysteine tRNA synthetase works in the cell by attaching cysteine onto its tRNA to form an aminoacyl-tRNA for protein synthesis.
Lysine tRNA Synthetase
Original Part: BBa_K2443012
Submitted by: Lethbridge iGEM 2017
Designed by: iGEM17_Lethbridge
Brief description: Lysine tRNA synthetase works in the cell by attaching cysteine onto its tRNA to form an aminoacyl-tRNA for protein synthesis.
Phenylalanine tRNA Synthetase alpha subunit (PheRS alpha)
Original Part: BBa_K2443014
Submitted by: Lethbridge iGEM 2017
Designed by: iGEM17_Lethbridge
Brief Description:  Phenylalanine tRNA synthetase works in the cell by attaching cysteine onto its tRNA to form an aminoacyl-tRNA for protein synthesis. The alpha subunit is one of the two subunits for this function.
Serine tRNA Synthetase (SerRS)
Original Part: BBa_K2443019
Submitted by: Lethbridge iGEM 2017
Designed by: iGEM17_Lethbridge
Brief Description: Serine tRNA synthetase works in the cell by attaching cysteine onto its tRNA to form an aminoacyl-tRNA for protein synthesis.
Valine tRNA Synthetase (ValRS)
Original Part: BBa_K2443023
Submitted by: Lethbridge iGEM 2017
Designed by: iGEM17_Lethbridge
Brief Description:Valine tRNA synthetase works in the cell by attaching cysteine onto its tRNA to form an aminoacyl-tRNA for protein synthesis.
Initiation Factor I (IF1)
Original Part: BBa_K2443024
Submitted by: Lethbridge iGEM 2017
Designed by: iGEM17_Lethbridge
Brief Description: IF1 is a prokaryotic protein that interacts with the ribosome by binding to the A site, preventing aminoacyl tRNA from entering the ribosome.
Initiation Factor 3 (IF1)
Original Part: BBa_K2443025
Submitted by: Lethbridge iGEM 2017
Designed by: iGEM17_Lethbridge
Brief Description: IF-3 is a prokaryotic protein that binds to the 30S subunit of the ribosome to increase chances of availability for starting protein synthesis.
Elongation Factor- Thermo Unstable (EF-Tu)
Original Part: BBa_K2443027
Submitted by: Lethbridge iGEM 2017
Designed by: iGEM17_Lethbridge
Brief Description:EF-Tu (elongation factor thermo unstable) is a prokaryotic elongation factor which catalyzes the binding of an aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) to the ribosome for the creation of the peptide chain.
Elongation Factor-Thermo Stable (EF-Ts)
Original Part: BBa_K2443028
Submitted by: Lethbridge iGEM 2017
Designed by: iGEM17_Lethbridge
Brief Description: EF-Ts is a prokaryotic elongation factor. EF-Ts acts at the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for EF-Tu. It releases GTP from EF-Tu, enabling EF-Tu to bind to a new GTP molecule and catalyze another tRNA addition.
MyoKinase (MK)
Original Part: BBa_K2443033
Submitted by: Lethbridge iGEM 2017
Designed by: iGEM17_Lethbridge
Brief Description: Myokinase (MK) is a phosphotransferase enzyme that is responsible for the catalyzing the interconversion of adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, and AMP), which is crucial for energy homeostasis in the cell.
Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase (NDK)
Original Part: BBa_K2443035
Submitted by: Lethbridge iGEM 2017
Designed by: iGEM17_Lethbridge
Brief description: NDK is responsible for the exchange of a phosphates between different nucleoside diphosphates (NDP) and triphosphates (NTP).
