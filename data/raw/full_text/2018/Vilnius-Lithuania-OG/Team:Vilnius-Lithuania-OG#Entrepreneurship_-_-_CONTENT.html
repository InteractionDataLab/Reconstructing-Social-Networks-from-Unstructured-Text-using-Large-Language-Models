We put an effort into clearing a market demand for our system by consulting with our sponsors and other professionals while in the same time establishing <STRONG>a potential customer network</STRONG>. Also, to protect our idea for the future implementation, we have <STRONG>submitted a patent application</STRONG> covering our solution and prepared a short guide on what the future iGEM teams should take into account in order to protect their intellectual property. Lastly, we have covered important factors and indicators that will help to turn our project into business.</P><SECTION id="section-market" class="page-section"><DIV class="fancy-title title-border-color"><H2>Market demand</H2></DIV><P>Using enzymes for compound synthesis has great advantages over chemical synthesis, such as shorter synthesis routes, reduced waste and high product yields. Moreover, enzymes are biodegradable and thus are a better alternative considering ecological aspect.</P><P>Yet, each unique enzyme takes years to develop, while the industry demand for biocatalysts is growing at a rapid pace. Numerous amino acid combinations form enzymes, but only a handful of them can transform a given substrate into the required product.</P><P>For example, after pharmaceutical company fully develops a particular drug, it takes an <STRONG>average of two additional years</STRONG> to develop the enzyme(s) that can facilitate synthesis of such molecule. And even advanced screening technologies and protein evolution cannot fully satisfy these market needs.</P><P>The enzyme industry has experienced significant growth due to the global growing demand for cleaner and greener technology, according to 2017 BCC Research. Moreover, the global market for industrial enzymes is expected to grow from nearly $5.0 billion in 2016 to $6.3 billion in 2021. Provided there is an increasing demand for enzymes in global market, it is safe to say there is also an increasing demand for protein engineering solutions. Also, the global protein engineering market is expected to reach $3.09 billion by 2025, according to a 2017 report by Grand View Research.</P><SECTION id="section-solution" class="page-section"><DIV class="fancy-title title-border-color"><H2>Our solution</H2></DIV><P>Our team is ready to take the first steps into the new era of enzyme engineering.

We have participated in this competition with our CAT-Seq and ReactionGAN systems. Of course, at spring our project was in design stages, yet the motivation and ideas we had on how we could solve the current problems of novel biological part creation has left the judges a huge impression.</P><P>For this reason, we have<STRONG> Won the “Searching for Innovators”</STRONG>competition! The prize was a year long support in the from of active <STRONG>Mentoring</STRONG>. MITA will now help us establish a business, consult us in the topics of business strategy, finance, marketing and other.</P><P>That said, a <STRONG>high-technology startup that we plan to become</STRONG> after the iGEM competition would most benefit from accelerating in the international startup accelerators in hubs that are focused around Life Sciences and Biotechnology, and that is what we plan to do after the iGEM!</P><DIV class="fancy-title title-border-color"><H2>Google support</H2></DIV><P>In august, Startup Lithuania announced a collaboration with the Google Cloud for Startups Program. The goal of the program is to help early-stage startups to take advantage of the cloud and get resources to quickly launch their idea on google platforms.</P><P>This was a wonderful opportunity for us as we were already using google platform to train or Generative Adversarial Networks for novel protein generation. The problem was that the training was very resource intensive and we did not have enough finances run it for a long time.</P><P>So, as the partnership between Startup Lithuania and Google has begun, we have submitted an motivational and strategic application to Startup Lithuania.</P><P>Soon after, we have received the sponsorship and were extremely happy we can accelerate our research on generative adversarial networks for unique catalytic biomolecule creation.</P><SECTION id="section-intellectual" class="page-section"><DIV class="fancy-title title-border-color"><H2>Protection of the Intellectual Property (IP)</H2></DIV><P>As we are<STRONG> planning to commercialize our solution after the iGEM</STRONG>, we have had to carefully consider on how to protect our work throughout the iGEM year, yet still provide ourselves and other teams the<STRONG> full open-source iGEM experience</STRONG>. For this reason, we have strategized to<STRONG> submit a patent application</STRONG> on CAT-Seq system just before the biological part submission date.</P><P>There are some things we also plan to keep as a trade secret (for everything that will be <STRONG>developed after</STRONG> iGEM). For example, it would be smart to keep the connection between our experimental CAT-Seq pipeline and computational Artificial Intelligence pipeline a trade secret. That is because it would be very hard to protect it as a patent. That’s because here would be virtually no way to determine who would be using it, if it would be published as a patent. In contrast, it could be kept as a trade secret for a long time.</P><P>Right before the part submission deadline we have successfully submitted a national patent application. Writing the application was extremely challenging for us, as it was the first time for everyone. For that reason we have consulted with the IP department of our sponsors Thermo Fisher Scientific, which have helped us immensely to prepare a solid application. We plan to <STRONG>expand our patent application to USA and to the rest of Europe </STRONG>shortly after the iGEM competition ends.</P><DIV style="margin-top: 7%;" class="fancy-title title-border-color"><H2>A short iGEM guide on protecting IP using patents</H2></DIV><P>As we have spent a large amount of time considering and planning the best ways to carefully protect our IP, while still being an active, we thought that this collected knowledge would be useful for the future iGEM teams.</P><DIV class="sarasas"><P>1. A patent is basically <STRONG>a right to prevent others</STRONG> from manufacturing, using or selling your invention. They are very important in biotechnology industry as it takes a long time and to develop a novel product or technology and, also, the cost of that development is extremely high. Thus, a patent <STRONG>prevents competitors</STRONG> from using the patented materials or methods for commercial reasons. To be patentable your invention should be novel (it cannot be previously published), useful (have a <STRONG>known</STRONG> function) and non-obvious (e.g. obviously combining previously known elements to come to your invention would not work). The invention can be machines, processes (e. g. therapeutic or diagnostic methods) or compositions of matter (e. g. artificial proteins or nucleic acids, transgenic organisms). However, you cannot patent a product of nature (naturally occurring genes, proteins or other materials), scientific processes or theorems.</P><P>2. The first thing you should consider is whether you really <STRONG>need </STRONG>a patent. That is because patents can be very <STRONG>expensive </STRONG>to write, submit, maintain and enforce it - up to hundreds thousand of dollars. Another aspect is that some technologies are not worth to be patented because as they can be “outgrown” quickly, become obsolete or could be used confidentially as a <STRONG>trade secret</STRONG> (for example, software). However, a patent is a <STRONG>strong selling point for many investors</STRONG>, as they can later be used for licensing and collecting royalties by allowing other companies to use your invention. We would strongly advise the future iGEM teams to contact their university <STRONG>IP Management Office</STRONG>. Most universities have established procedures and assistants to help you with filing a patent application and explore other opportunities for your invention commercialization. Our university’s IP Office, together with our sponsors Thermo Fisher Scientific helped us a lot by defining the patent structure and clarifying specifications and claims of our invention.</P><P>3. If you have decided that you really do need a patent, you should then invest a lot of time <STRONG>in searching patents</STRONG>, <STRONG>scientific articles</STRONG> or <STRONG>conference abstracts</STRONG> that may have already described the thing you are trying to patent.The patent process is expensive and you don’t want spend a lot of time and money for filing an application when there is a previous invention that could prevent your patent or make it extremely narrow. Also, there always is a possibility that there was already a patent submitted that covers your patent, but did not receive commercial success. If this patent is expired, you can freely use the technology, but, on the other hand, there will be no ways to prevent others to do so as well.</P><P>By the way, it is worth to invest the time into the patent searches for a completely different reason as well - they can be a valuable source of knowledge on how to structure the claims and the main description. Patent “language” is a completely different style of writing and one can only start learning it - be reading more of them.</P><P>4. Generally speaking the patent is divided into three main parts: specifications, drawings and patent claims. The <STRONG>most important part of the patent is claims</STRONG>.They point out the aspects of your product or technology that you regard as your invention and define your exclusive rights to it. The rest of the patent is there to <STRONG>support </STRONG>to what is claimed. You will also need specifications (a full and complete description) of your invention which provides the proof of understanding of the claims, and drawings that illustrate certain aspects of the invention so the reader can follow the text more easily. When filing a patent you want to describe every detail of your invention, as well as its alternative versions. However, you can have the most thorough description of your invention but it will not matter unless you have been granted the claims that cover that description. Also, it is important to note that you <STRONG>can rearrange </STRONG>the patent application, but <STRONG>you cannot</STRONG> add a new material without filling a new patent application.</P><P>5. After you submit your application it is all about waiting. It may take up to a few years for patent to get fully accepted. This time is meant for the experts analysis, and also competitor disputes. </P></DIV><SECTION id="section-analysis" class="page-section"><DIV style="margin-top: 7%;" class="fancy-title title-border-color"><H2>Customer profile</H2></DIV><P>The largest part of our products will be unique and precisely tailored.
