Droplet coalescence time dependence t<SUB>coal</SUB> on fused droplet volumes V1 and V2</P><P>As we can see the coalescence time for the single value of <EM>V</EM><EM><SUB>1</SUB></EM> has some variation with a maximum. Scanning values from the smallest volume of produced droplet to the largest, there is a range of <EM>V<SUB>2</SUB></EM> (the produced droplet) with a longest coalescence time. When we look at the results for the larger droplets <EM>V<SUB>1</SUB></EM>, the coalescence time increases. Also, we notice that the interval of coalescence times is shorter and variation is smaller. This means that if we are increasing the volume V<SUB>1</SUB>, the coalescence time increases, but the interval of possible droplet coalescence becomes smaller. If there’s no solution found, it means no coalescence is occurring for given conditions (droplet volumes, voltage and other).</P><P style="font-size:80%; margin-bottom:5%;text-align:center">Figure 2. Droplet coalescence time t<SUB>coal</SUB> dependence on fused droplet volumes at different applied voltage U<SUB>app</SUB> values.</P><P>Next we compared the coalescence time results for various applied voltages <EM>U<SUB>app</SUB></EM>. We chose 3 different values of the applied voltage (0.3V, 0.4V and 0.5V). We have found that even a small increase (0.1V) of voltage strongly affects the coalescence time. With our calculations, the <EM>t<SUB>coal</SUB></EM> reduces approximately by factor of 3 as we increase the voltage from 0.3V to 0.5V.</P><P>What is even more interesting, is that the interval of possible droplet coalescence does not shorten when we increase the voltage. It becomes shorter only when the volume <EM>V<SUB>1</SUB></EM> is increased as we discussed previously.</P><P>Having the results for various conditions (<EM>V<SUB>1</SUB>, V<SUB>2</SUB>, U<SUB>app</SUB></EM>) we now need to determine which of these conditions are suitable for our droplet merging experiments. It is our goal to find a range of droplet volumes which can provide an efficient droplet coalescence.</P><P>Firstly, we need to have flow rates tuned appropriately so that the droplets do not pass the whole coalescence chamber without merging with a droplet from another droplet population. For that reason we chose t<SUB>flow</SUB> as an upper limit of the time it requires for the droplets to pass through the coalescence chamber. The flow time is expressed as a ratio of channel volume to a unit-volume of fluid (total of the oil):</P><P style="margin-left:65%; margin-top: -13%;">(31)</P><P style="margin-top: 7%;">If the calculated time <A href="javascript:;" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="coalescence time">t<SUB>coal</SUB></A> is <STRONG>longer</STRONG> than t<SUB>flow</SUB>, droplets will pass the coalescence chamber without fusion. That means if the droplets take a longer time to come together and merge then the time they spend in coalescence chamber, the merging will not occur. That is why we chose the t<SUB>flow</SUB> as the higher limit of allowed values.</P><P>Next, to find the lower limit must solve the different balance equation. We chose the lower limit as a time needed to remove the double volume of oil between two droplets. In other words, it is the situation where three droplets would merge instead of two. We express the volume of oil between three droplets as \(V_{oil}^{(limit)}=2 T_0 W_1 H\). This volume will be drained at the drainage flow rate. We then write the equation:</P><P style="margin-left:81%; margin-top: -13.5%;">(32)</P><P style="margin-top: 7%;">If the equation is True, three droplets will be fused together instead of two. Again, we need to limit our initially found <EM>t<SUB>coal</SUB></EM> values. Therefore, if the coalescence time of 3 droplets \(t_{coal}^{(3d)}\) is shorter than that of <EM>t<SUB>coal</SUB></EM>, we will find no pair-wise coalescence. The results are shown in Figure X below. The straight lines indicate the upper limit (time of the flow). The curves below are times for 3 droplet fusion. The points that are slightly below the curves for \(t_{coal}^{(3d)}\) represent the regions of stable 2 droplet coalescence with the 3 droplet coalescence time being longer \(t_{coal}^{(3d)} \gt t_{coal}\).</P><P style="font-size:80%; margin-bottom:5%;text-align:center">Figure 3. Droplet coalescence time dependence on fused droplet volume ratios at different applied voltage <EM>U<SUB>app</SUB></EM> values. The black line displays t<SUB>flow</SUB> - the coalescence time limit, at which droplets leave the merging chamber without fusing. Dotted lines correspond to coalescence time limit t<SUB>coal</SUB><SUP>(3d)</SUP> at which coalescence of 3 droplets occurs. The points that are slightly below the curves for represent the regions of stable 2 droplet coalescence</P><P>In conclusion, we find there to be an optimal range of droplet volume ratios V<SUB>2</SUB>/V<SUB>1</SUB> that allows stable effective 1:1 coalescence. Aproximately this is the interval from <STRONG>3 to 5</STRONG>. We also see that this interval gets smaller as we increase the voltage. The interval also becomes smaller with increasing volumes of <EM>V<SUB>1</SUB></EM>. We have also found that three-droplet merging should be present at the very low and the very high values of V<SUB>2</SUB>/V<SUB>1</SUB>. We have then experimentally tested these parameters and have successfully reached almost 100% effective droplet merging using volume ratio of 3 to 5. We have then proceeded to use the parameters in our CAT-Seq workflow.</P><P style="font-size:80%; margin-bottom:5%;text-align:center">Slowed down video of droplets merging</P><DIV class="toggle toggle-bg"><DIV class="togglet"><STRONG style="margin-left:4%;">Physics alphabet</STRONG></DIV><DIV class="togglec"><TABLE class="table table-striped"><THEAD><TR><TH>Symbol</TH><TH>Description</TH><TH>[units]/(sizes)</TH></TR></THEAD><TBODY><TR><TD>A<SUB>H</SUB></TD><TD>Hamaker constant</TD><TD>(10<SUP>-18</SUP>J)</TD></TR><TR><TD>a</TD><TD>Surfactant monomer size</TD><TD>(~2nm)</TD></TR><TR><TD>C</TD><TD>Electric capacitance</TD><TD>[F] </TD></TR><TR><TD>C<SUB>s</SUB></TD><TD>Bulk concentration of surfactant</TD><TD>[mol/m<SUP>3</SUP>]</TD></TR><TR><TD>D</TD><TD>Drag coefficient</TD><TD>[dimensionless]</TD></TR><TR><TD>d</TD><TD>Spacing</TD></TR><TR><TD>E</TD><TD>Energy</TD><TD>[J]</TD></TR><TR><TD>f</TD><TD>Frequency of AC-current</TD><TD>[Hz]</TD></TR><TR><TD>H</TD><TD>Height of the chip</TD><TD>[m]</TD></TR><TR><TD>k<SUB>ads</SUB></TD><TD>Surfactant adsorption constant</TD><TD>(k<SUB>ads</SUB>=18mol<SUP>-1</SUP>s<SUP>-1</SUP>)</TD></TR><TR><TD>k<SUB>des</SUB></TD><TD>Surfactant desorption constant</TD><TD>(k<SUB>des</SUB>=6·10<SUP>-3</SUP>s<SUP>-1</SUP>)</TD></TR><TR><TD>l</TD><TD>Length of the channel</TD><TD>[m]</TD></TR><TR><TD>N</TD><TD>Number of droplets</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>n</TD><TD>Power-law index for non-Newtonian viscosity</TD><TD>(n=1.2)</TD></TR><TR><TD>Q</TD><TD>Flow rate of fluid</TD><TD>[m<SUP>3</SUP>/s]</TD></TR><TR><TD>R<SUB>1,2</SUB></TD><TD>Radius of droplet</TD><TD>[m]</TD></TR><TR><TD>R</TD><TD>Universal gas constant</TD><TD>(R=8.314 J/mol/K)</TD></TR><TR><TD>T</TD><TD>Absolute temperature</TD><TD>[K]</TD></TR><TR><TD>T</TD><TD>Thickness of droplet spacing-oil</TD><TD>[m]</TD></TR><TR><TD>t</TD><TD>Time</TD><TD>[s]</TD></TR><TR><TD>U</TD><TD>Electric voltage</TD><TD>[V]</TD></TR><TR><TD>V</TD><TD>Volume of droplet</TD><TD>[m<SUP>3</SUP>]</TD></TR><TR><TD>γ</TD><TD>Interfacial tension</TD><TD>[N/m]</TD></TR><TR><TD>ε<SUB>0</SUB></TD><TD>Dielectric constant</TD><TD>(ε<SUB>0</SUB>=8.85·10<SUP>-12</SUP>F/m)</TD></TR><TR><TD>ε</TD><TD>Relative dielectric permittivity</TD><TD>(ε<SUB>PDMS</SUB>=2.5, ε<SUB>Oil</SUB>=5.8, ε<SUB>Glass</SUB>=7.5)</TD></TR><TR><TD>η</TD><TD>Dynamic viscosity</TD><TD>[Pa·s]</TD></TR><TR><TD>θ</TD><TD>Contact angle</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>κ</TD><TD>electric conductivity</TD><TD>[S/m]</TD></TR><TR><TD>ρ</TD><TD>Material density</TD><TD>[kg/m<SUP>3</SUP>]</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></DIV><DIV class="toggle toggle-bg"><DIV class="togglet"><STRONG>References</STRONG></DIV><DIV class="togglec" id="reflistas"><OL><LI>Barman , Nagarajan AK, Khare K., RSC Adv.2015, 5.</LI><LI>C.
