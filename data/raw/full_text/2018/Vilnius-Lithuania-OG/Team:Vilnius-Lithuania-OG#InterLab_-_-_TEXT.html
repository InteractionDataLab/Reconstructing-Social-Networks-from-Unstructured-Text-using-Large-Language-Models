Conclusions
The        fifth InterLab study has launched and it further attempts to develop        a standard procedure for green fluorescent protein (GFP) measurements        to reduce variability across laboratories in the world. This year the        attempt is to normalize fluorescence measurements to colony forming        units (CFU) instead of optical density of the culture since it is a        great source of variability among labs. Two approaches were used to        compute the cell number in the samples:
Converting         absorbance of cells to absorbance of known concentration beads;
Counting         CFU in the samples.
Methods and Results
1. Calibration protocols
At        firstly, we measured absorbance (Abs600)        of weakly scattering LUDOX CL-X to obtain a multiplication factor of        Abs600 to transform absorbance values to the comparable OD600 units.
Following        that, we prepared serial dilutions of monodisperse silica        microspheres and obtained standard particle curve (Fig.        1) which allows to        convert Abs600 measurements to        an estimated number of cells.
Figure        1. Standard particle curve obtained by using microspheres that        are similar size to a cell displayed in (A) a linear scale and        (B) a log scale.
The        final calibration was that of fluorescein concentration. We generated        a standard curve of fluorescence for fluorescein concentration by,        again, making serial dilutions of fluorescein (Fig.        2). This way we        could convert our cell based readings of fluorescence to an        equivalent fluorescein concentration.  The measurements were taken        with the same setting as those which would be used measuring cell        fluorescence.

2. Cell measurement protocol
We        were provided with six different devices (Test device 1 - BBa_J364000 ,        Test device 2 - BBa_J364001 ,        Test device 3 - BBa_J364002 ,        Test device 4 - BBa_J364007 ,        Test device 5 - BBa_J364008 ,        Test device 6 - BBa_J364009 ) along with negative ( BBa_R0040 ) and positive        ( BBa_I20270 ) controls which then we transformed into E.        coli DH5α strain. Devices express GFP under Anderson promoters of different        strength and are in the pSB1C3 backbone which carries resistance to        chloramphenicol.
We        made overnight cultures of two colonies of each transformation plate.        The next day, the cultures were diluted to OD600=0.02        and grown for 6 hours. The absorbance (600 nm) (Fig. 3A) and        fluorescence (485/520, gain = 50) (Fig. 3B) of cultures were measured        at 0 and 6 hours.

The        negative control demonstrates the highest absorbance which could be        the result of the lowest metabolic load of all the devices, since it        has no GFP expressed. On the other hand, devices 1, 4 and 5 show much        slower bacteria growth even though the fluorescence of these devices        is not the highest. Furthermore, device 1 demonstrates a really        moderate absorbance and fluorescence increase after 6 hours        suggesting that environmental factors could have impeded sample        growth.
Next,        the previous data (absorbance and fluorescence) was normalized to the        comparable OD units (Fig. 4A) and then to particles (Fig. 4B) so that we could        determine the mean expression level of GFP per cell.
Figure 4. Normalization of fluorescence to the OD units (A) and MFEL per particle (B).
After        6 hours all the devices (except the negative control) demonstrates a        relatively decreased level of fluorescence. That could be explained        by cells reaching a certain level of GFP expression after which the        fluorescence stops increasing whereas absorption steadily goes up.
3. Colony forming units (CFU) per 0.1 OD600
The        second approach is to calibrate OD600 to CFU which reflects the cell count in the sample. For this approach        only negative and positive controls were used.
The        overnight cultures of two colonies per control were diluted to        OD600=0.1        (three replications) and serial dilutions were made which then were        spreaded on agar plates. The next morning the colonies were counted        to find out the number of cells in the samples.
NC        1.1 and PC 1.2 samples  has shown relatively high and low values        respectively comparing to other samples which could indicate a        systematic error in a serial dilution step.
Conclusions
In this study cell fluorescence depends on the strength of the promotor under which GFP was expressed. However, all the cells with different devices demonstrated a reduced fluorescence per cell after 6 hours indicating a slowed down GFP production.
