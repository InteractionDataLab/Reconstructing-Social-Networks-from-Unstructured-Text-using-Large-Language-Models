Adithya Upadhya
Adithya Upadhya is a math virtuoso. As disgusted as he looks in the picture above, he actually loves working for iGEM. Adithya's contribution to PhageShift can be found on our modelling page. When he's not fantasising about numbers, Adithya plays the guitar and caresses his hair.

Aditi Ajith Pujar
The conjuring of sentences of magnanimous proportions for the collective benefit of the team is a task accomplished by Aditi on grievously short notices. While some people put their foot down to get work done, Aditi gets a bulldozer and threatens to run you over with it. Aditi is working for the logistics team this year.
×
Adwaith B Uday
Adwaith is the sweetest guy in the team. Period. Often seen working on Interlab with Gokul under the hood. Adwaith is also a fantastic Carnatic singer and musician, capturing the hearts of listeners with his melodious voice and sick mridangam beats.

Ashim Kumar Dubey
Reading papers and working with phages is one of the many things he loves doing, besides binging entire seasons of TV shows and hoarding food in his room (truly a blessing to everyone in the hostel).

Bhoomika Bhat

Bhaskar Kumawat
The man himself, Bhaskar is our benevolent leader. When he's not reading papers and ordering people around, Bhaskar likes listening to non-mainstream music and coming up with incredibly creative acronyms.
×
Bhoomika Bhat
Bhoomika likes killing bacteria (only gram positive for now, but she's trying to diversify) and making sure they remain dead. In her free time, she does a lot of cloning and likes to play the flute.
×
Debabrata Ghosh
Debu has a thing for phages and sleeping at odd times during the day. Legends say he has missed whole weeks without realising it.

Gokul Krishna
Gokul is an expert at the art of Jugaad and resolving seemingly insurmountable problems with lab equipment. In his free time, he likes asking a lot of questions, sleeping and trying new (and sometimes very unusual) things.
×
Gopika Ranjith
An integral part of the Human Practices team, Gopika Ranjith is one of many whose contribution can be seen in our very own short-story collection. When she's not working, Gopika likes to overdose on coke and chips.

Monica U
The ever-zealous Monica is a key member of the Human practices team. Her relentless dedication and commitment to work is her ultimate secret of getting a task accomplished with just one glare. This beautiful soul is a very good singer and loves reading in her free time.
×
Nived Krishnan S
Nived is our silent saviour. An avid coder and web-designer, Nived supervises the entire wiki-making process, helping all of us design the wiki in the most perfect of ways. Also, you can blame him for anything that's wrong in the wiki. Other than that, Nived's dancing skills are renowned all over the campus. Legend has it that Michael Jackson came out of his grave to see Nived's moonwalk. Oh wait Nived can't do a moonwalk. My bad.
×
Preetham Venkatesh
This man, right here, has done immense work for PACMAN! Be it working on software or getting the, sometimes lazy, members of the human practices to work, Preetham’s a sweetheart, except for, when it comes to pulling his buddy Bhaskar’s legs! While he can get you to roll on floor laughing, the extremely talented actor that he is, Preetham touches the hearts of the audience with his performance!

Sidharth Soundararajan
Sidharth is a Math whiz. As fun and chilled out, a person as he is, Sidharth is very serious when it comes to working on the model for the project. While he is not engrossed in fascinating the beauty of proofs, he spends his time reading novels, and is also an amazing violinist.

The most entertaining member of the Human practices and the software subteams, Vidhi is the unbeatable loudspeaker of the team. While she isn't busy talking, Vidhi loves to eat, watch TV shows back-to-back but sleeping stays her esteemed hobby.
