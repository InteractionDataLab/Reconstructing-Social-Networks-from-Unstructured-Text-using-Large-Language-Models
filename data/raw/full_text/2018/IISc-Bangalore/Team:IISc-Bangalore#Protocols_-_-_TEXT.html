Add 1 ml elution buffer into the tube. Mix it for 30 minutes.
Spin it at 5000 rpm at 4ºC for 5 minutes. Pipette out the supernatant into another microfuge tube and label it as Elution. This would contain the required His-tagged protein.
Rin an SDS PAGE with the supernatant, wash and elution to check for the purified protein.
Protein expression and extraction from inclusion bodies
NOTE: This protocol is to be used after the presence of insoluble protein in the form of inclusion bodies has been verified. This can be done by using lysis buffers with increasing concentrations of a detergent like SDS to see if the protein is recovered in the lysate (see Characterization for BBa_K2609007 ). To regain activity after urea denaturation, a refolding step is also needed.
Pellet the cells after induction by centrifuging at 6,000 rpm for 10 mins (4ºC).
Wash the cell pellet with 1xPBS (1:10 initial culture volume) twice followed by centrifugation at 6,000rpm (10mins at 4ºC).
Sonicate the cells for 20 minutes (total) after resuspending them in 1/10 culture volume of 1xPBS with a 10 sec ON, 10 sec OFF pulse.
Centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 15 min (4ºC)
Resuspend the pellet in 8M Urea denaturation buffer (1:10 culture vol.) and incubate at 4ºC for 24 hrs with constant mixing.
Centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 15 mins at 4ºC and store the supernatant.
The supernatant should now contain your protein along with other cellular proteins. Use the following protocol to purify and refold it (provided it is 6xHis tagged).
6x-Histag purification and refolding after extraction from inclusion bodies
The protein lysate from the last protocol can be directly used for 6xHis purification with the following buffer compositions: Binding buffer , Wash Buffer and Elution buffer .
To refold the protein after purification, dialyse against the following buffers in a step by step fashion (constant stirring, 4ºC, 10 hrs per buffer)
6M Urea buffer
4M Urea buffer
2M Urea buffer
0M Urea buffer
Phage Work
Purification of phage lysate
Make 1% secondary inoculum(100ml) of the MG1655 (the strain of E.coliwe used)
Grow with aeration till 0.6 OD.
Add 1 ml of phages(109PFU/ml) into the culture.
Incubate it at 37ºC till the culture gets cleared.
Centriguge the lysate at 4000g for 20 minutes.
Collect supernatant into a sterile falcon tube.
Filter sterilize using 0.22 um filter to yield lysate.
Add 1/10th volume of chloroform to the supernatant, vortex and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Centrifuge at 4000g for 5 minutes.
Store at 4ºC
Plaque Assay
Make 1% secondary inoculum of the MG1655 (the strain of E.coli we used)
Grow with aeration till 0.6 OD.
Add 50 μl of the culture into a sterile falcon tube.
Add 50 μl of phages into the tube and mix it.
Leave it for 20-30 minutes.
Add 3 ml of top agar into the tube and mix it.
Pour it into a LB plate immediately and wait till the top agar soldifies.
Incubate the plate for 16-18 hours.
You will see a lawn of bacteria (if your phages did not infect the cells) or you will see plaques or clearings (if the phages infected the cells). Count the number of plaques and you will get the PFU/ml(plaques forming units) value for your phage units.
Resazurin Assay
We used this assay to relate the MOI of bacteriophages with the MIC of a particular antibiotic, with respect to a fixed volume of bacterial culture. This assay essentially gives the viability of cells.
Prepare a bacterial inoculum identical to the one in step 3 of the PFU determination assay.
Aliquot the following into 1.5ml microfuge tubes: 470ul LB medium, 25ul of the above bacterial inoculum and 5ul of a particular phage/antibiotic dilution. Make sure to include controls in which there are no bacteriophages or viruses, and one with only the medium. Create replicates of each tube.(Note: The solution above only contains 1% of the particular phage/antibiotic dilution and hence the concentration in the solution will be 10-2 times that in the prepared stock.)
Vortex the tubes gently to mix the contents, and then proceed to shake-incubate them at 37° C and 220 RPM for two and half hours.
Remove the tubes from the incubator and pipette out 100ul of each sample into a designated well in the microtitre plate. Make sure to label the wells appropriately and arrange the dilutions in an orderly manner. Also, include a positive control with only the cells.
Pipette 20ul of well-mixed 0.02% resazurin solution (also called alamar blue) into each well. Use a resuspension-like action to ensure mixing with the sample. Do this procedure in a darkened environment.
Cover the plate and wrap it in aluminium foil. Incubate it at 37° C for 20 minutes.
Take out the plate, unwrap it and place it in the plate reader. Take absorbance readings for both 570nm and 600nm wavelengths of light.
The percentage of dead cells is given by the formula, ((O2*A1)-(O1*A2))/((O2*P1)-(O1*P2)), where
O1 = molar extinction coefficient (E) of oxidized alamarBlue (Blue) at 570 nm = 80586
O2= E of oxidized alamarBlue at 600 nm = 117216
A1 = absorbance of test wells at 570 nm
A2 = absorbance of test wells at 600 nm
P1 = absorbance of positive growth control well (cells plus alamarBlue but no test agent) at 570 nm
P2 = absorbance of positive growth control well (cells plus alamarBlue but no test agent at 600 nm
Extraction of phage DNA
Take 1 ml of phage lysate in a microfuge tube.
Add 10 ul of 0.1 M MgSO4 to the tube (final conc. of 1mM).
Add 20 ul of 20 mg/ml lysozyme.
Add 2 ul each of 20 mg/ml DNAse and 40 mg/ml RNAse.
Incubate at 37°C for 2 hours.

Add 50 ul of 10% SDS solution (final conc. of 0.5 %)
Add 3 ul of 20 mg/ml of Proteinase K (final conc. of 50 ug/ml).
Incubate at 50°C for 1 hour.
Add equal amount of equilibriated phenol:chloroform(1:1) mixture. Mix it well by rotating the tube slowly.
Spin the tube at 13000g for 5 minutes. Pipette out the aqueous layer (usually the top layer) into another microfuge tube.Discard the rest.
Add equal amount of chloroform to this tube. Mix
