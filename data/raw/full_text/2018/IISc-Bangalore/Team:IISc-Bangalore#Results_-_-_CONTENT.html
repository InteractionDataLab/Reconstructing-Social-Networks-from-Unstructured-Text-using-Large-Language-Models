        Aiming to eliminate the shortcomings of the existing <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J18932">BBa_J18932</A> (mCherry RFP), we replaced the internal RBS like sequence, with a generated weaker sequence (with conserved amino acid sequence). As a result, we obtained a BioBrick <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2609006">BBa_K2609006</A> that generates mCherry with reduced truncation.

        </P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-7"><P id="mcppara"><B>Expression and purification of mcp-1</B>
                Mcp-1 was produced in E coli. BL21(DE3) by using the part <I>mcp-1 under T7</I>. Protein was produced by induction at OD600=0.6 with 250<SPAN class="mu">μ</SPAN>M IPTG and grown for 16 hours at 25°C. The protein was forming inclusion bodies and hence was solubilized in 8M urea. This was directly applied to an Ni-NTA column and purified. The 6xHis tag purified protein was then dialized to get pure mcp-1 in PBS. Performing a Bradford Assay on the dialized protein gave a concentration of 49.8  <SPAN class="mu">μ</SPAN>g/mL.
            </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-7"><P><B>Characterisation of Lambda RED BioBrick</B>
                We characterised the Lambda RED BioBrick BBa_K1433005 using the generator BBa_K2609026 by expression and visualising on SDS PAGE. This part is under T7 expression system and hence was transformed into E coli BL21(DE3) and induced with 500 <SPAN class="mu">μ</SPAN>M IPTG at OD600 = 0.6 and grown for 3 hours at 37°C. Cell pellet was boiled with SDS sample buffer and loaded ran on SDS PAGE.
                Bands were observed slightly below 32kDa ladder band and at the 25kDa ladder band. These two correspond to the bet protein (29.7 kDa) and the exo protein (25.9 kDa). The other protein - gam (16.3 kDa) - could not be seen on the gel. This could be because the part has only one RBS sequence for all three proteins. It could be either that the third protein is being produced in very small amounts or not at all.
            </P></DIV></DIV><P><B>Characterisation of T4 Endolysin BioBrick</B>
        We characterised the BioBrick BBa_K2609001 using the generator BBa_K2609017 by the size of the protein produced and by its function. Since, this part is under a constitutive promoter, it cannot be induced. Hence, bands of E coli BL21(DE3) containing this part were compared with the bands of E coli BL21(DE3). The SDS PAGE is shown below.
    </P><P>
        We also characterised the lystic activity of recombinantly produced T4 Endolysin. For this, we extracted protein from E coli BL21(DE3) containing the endolsyin plasmid along with wild type. B Cereus, a gram positive bacteria, was grown to mid log phase and then suspended in 0.2mM Tris-HCl (pH 8). 0.1 volumes of the following were added:
    </P><UL><LI>Protein extract from E coli BL21(DE3) containing T4 Endolysin</LI><LI>Protein extract from wild type E coli BL21(DE3)</LI><LI>Protein lysis buffer</LI><LI>Control blank buffer</LI></UL><P>
        OD600 was measured using a plate reader continuously over a span of two hours. We obtained the graph shown above after taking average from multiple replicates. From this, we see that endolysin reduces B Cereus cell density faster than the other solutions. This is confirmation that recombinantly produced T4 Endolysin is functional and acts as a lysozyme.
    </P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-7"><P><B>Extraction of Phage DNA</B>
            Using an enzymatic protocol with Proteinase K and DNAse, we obtained T4 bacteriophage genomic DNA. The DNA could be seen precipitating after on addition of isopropanol. Following spectrophotometric analysis of the DNA, it was found to be very high concentration (~2 <SPAN class="mu">μ</SPAN>g/<SPAN class="mu">μ</SPAN>L) and high purity (A260/A280 = 1.8). 
        </P></DIV></DIV><H4 id="results3.2">What Didn't Work</H4><P><B>Electroporation of T4 phage DNA</B>
            We were unable to electroporate the extremely long ~169kbp genome of T4 bacteriophage. We tried electroporation of the extracted DNA into different strains of E coli in multiple trials with no success. We also consulted the highly experienced in bacteriophage research, Prof. Ryland Young and Prof. Graham Hatfull, for their inputs. Even so, we were not able to troubleshoot the problem.
        </P><P><B>Recombination with the Lambda RED System</B>
            We were unable to recombine with using the Lambda RED BioBrick BBa_K2609026 made from BBa_K1433005. We tried a test recombination of plasmids in multiple trials but were unable to generate any recombinants.
        </P><P><B>Generation of T4 phage recombinants</B>
            The success of this part depended on the success of the previous two parts. Since, neither of them gave any positive result, we were unable to proceed to this step.
        </P><H3 id="results4">PACMAN</H3><H4 id="results4.1">What Worked</H4><P><B>Expression and Purification of Wild Type gp37</B>
            In order to isolate gp37 for further studies, it was essential that it was properly folded. This protein needs two chaperones for correct folding i.e. gp38 and gp57.
            Thus, we did a triple transformation of all the three gene-containing plasmids, expressed by induction with 500<SPAN class="mu">μ</SPAN>M IPTG at OD600=0.6 and grown at 25°C for 10 hours.<B>Folding and Ligand Interaction of Wild Type gp37</B>
            A CD (Circular Dichroism) measurement was performed, and this CD spectrum showed a dip at the wavelength corresponding to exclusively the β pleated structure, hence giving us substantial evidence of its correct folding.
            We measured CD Spectra of WT gp37 in the presence of different concentrations of the ligand PEtN. We plotted the minimum angle against ligand concentration and obtained the below graph. From the we can conclude that there is no binding between WT gp37 and PEtN as there is no observable trend. This can be explained by the fact that the thermal energy of the protein and the ligand are greater than the interaction energy between them.
        </P><P><B>Assembly and expression of gp37 M2 under T7 expression system</B>
                The BioBrick part BBa_K2609013 was assembled, and verified to be correct through DNA sequencing. It was then transformed into E coli BL21(DE3) and induced with 500<SPAN class="mu">μ</SPAN>M IPTG at OD600 = 0.6 and grown for 3 hours at 37°C. The cell pellet was then loaded on SDS PAGE. 
            </P><H4 id="results4.2">What Didn't Work</H4><P><B>Assembly of gp37 M1,M3 and M4</B>
        The other three modifications of gp37 could not be assembled even after multiple trials. 
    </P><P><B>Purification of Correctly Folded gp37 M2</B>
        Since gp37 needs its chaperones gp38 &amp; gp57 to fold correctly, the three proteins had to be triple transformed and then expressed. Following multiple trials of triple transformation, we did not obtain a transformant that expressed all three proteins. Thus, we could not obtain correctly folded gp37 M2 to proceed further.
