Safety
Safe Project Design
For the screening of RNA aptamer probes, we used in vitro transcribed 22-bp long fragments of influenza viral RNA instead of its full length to prevent release of viral factors outside of the lab. When doing the characterization of aptamer RNA, we have substituted the real patient nasal fluid sample with artificial nasal fluid conditions based on literature. We did not use any material that could possibly contain influenza virus. We carefully mimicked  the concentrations of sodium, potassium and calcium in nasal samples, so as to proof that our aptamer RNA works in nasal fluid.
Safe Lab Work
All of our wet lab team members have obtained safety training certificates, including chemical and biological safety issued by CUHK’s University Safety Office (USO). Our laboratory is a BSL-1 lab. We chose two non-pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, DH5 alpha and BL21, as the chassis organism for our team’s project.
Safety issue of tracer
High-intensity light can cause permanent damage to human eyes. Thus, though laser diode may provide a better concentrated light we still choose to use LED as the light source. (And we also have a warning sign on Tracer cause high power LED may also cause damage to human eyes)
The angles of the final version of tracer is designed to be smooth.
All the components of tracer are well-encapsulated.
