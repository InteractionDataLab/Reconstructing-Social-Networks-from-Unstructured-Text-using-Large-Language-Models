Best Model Special Prize
We did a full-sided modeling of our project. We modeled each part of our project (wet lab, software, hardware) and also the project as a whole.
For wet lab, based on our data, we construct a model for predicting the performance of aptamer on recognizing viral RNA mathematically, with the help of existing bioinformatics programs.
For hardware, we perform test on the sensitivity of our hardware using GFP dilution by compared the results of plate reader and the results of our hardware combined with Image J.
For software, since our project is providing a self-detection tool of influenza for the general public, when the users upload their images to our software, we collect their data like location and symptoms, and thus model the disease distribution in the local area, which has great significance in disease monitoring and control.
For the whole project, we modeled the accuracy of our project after integrating all parts of our project including wet lab, hardware and software together.
