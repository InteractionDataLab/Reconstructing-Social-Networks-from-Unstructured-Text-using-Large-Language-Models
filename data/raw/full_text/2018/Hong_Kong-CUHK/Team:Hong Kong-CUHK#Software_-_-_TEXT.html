Best Software Tool Special Prize
Our software can be divided into two parts, the first part is helping the users analyze the picture the users take through our hardware, the second part is to monitor the disease distribution in the local area based on the data we have collected when the users upload the pictures to our website. The reason why we think we are outstanding in developing software is that firstly, different from many previous iGem team, our software is targeting the public and the government(disease control center), and is completely user-friendly even for people without synthetic biology background; secondly, we have performed calibration in our software so that the types of camera, the way that users take picture will not affect the diagnostic results. Lat but not the least, our software is very accurate according to our modeling results!
