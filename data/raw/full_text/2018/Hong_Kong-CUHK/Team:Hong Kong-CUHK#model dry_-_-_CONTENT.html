To achieve that, we have tried to compare among the more well-functioning aptamers with those that does not function well.
</P><P>Taking in an account in the assumption that the aptamer can achieve induce-fluoresce with a model that:</P><OL type="1" style="font-size:14pt;"><LI><B>The truncated minispanich is destabilized in the aptamer</B> so it would not be able to form the G-quaduplex that account to for the fluorescent
</LI><LI><B>The destablized truncated minispanich aptamer</B> can bind with target RNA to <B>re-stabilize</B> the structure,</LI></OL><P>As such, we define a “<B>good</B>” aptamer as those designs that:</P><OL type="1" style="font-size:14pt;"><LI>Have <B>low auto-fluorescent</B></LI><LI><B>Inducible</B> by target</LI></OL><P>while, to path the way toward rational design of aptamers, the read out that we used from wet lab data are:</P><OL type="1" style="font-size:14pt;"><LI><B>fluorescent count</B> when only the RNA aptamer exists</LI><LI>given that the truncated minispanich is destabilized in the aptamer, the <B>fold change</B> in the fluorescent count of the experimental set which target is added, over which target not added
</LI><P>Part 1. Whether the <B>truncated minispanich</B> is <B>destabilized</B> in the aptamer (auto-fluoresce v.s induce-fluoresce)
</P><P>Our designs are derived from a truncated minispanich (P1-a4-b5), which is produced by one base pair reduction (from 5 base pairs to 4) in stem a of the original fluoresing minispanich (P1-a5-b5) as described by Wei et al [1]. Therefore, we expect that a “well-destabilized” aptamer probe (and hence does not auto-fluoresce) are less likely to have strong interaction in the remaining 4 base pairs in stem a, which refers to the nucleotide 14-62, 15-61, 16-60 and 17-59 in our aptamer probe. Therefore, we built a scoring equation by multiple linear regression by plotting the mean fluorescent count of the aptamers designed (in the absence of target) from our wet lab experiment (N=17) against the binding probability of nucleotide 14-62, 15-61, 16-60 and 17-59 calculated by CentroidFold [2] and obtained the best fit (smallest R2) scoring equation as:
</P><P>f(Score A)= -65075374(binding probability of nucleotide 14-62)+706797383(binding probability of nucleotide 15-61)-1617284819(binding probability of nucleotide 16-60)+27305386(binding probability of nucleotide 17-59)
</P><P>High Score A suggests the aptamer design is more likely to be auto fluoresing. From the diagram above, the scoring equation shows distinct score for one of the aptamer probes showing strong auto-fluorescent but missed out another one. Also, this proposed scoring still has to be tested with more extra data with designs with high score and low score respectively. Yet, it can still be useful in screening out some of the aptamer designs that is likely to be auto-fluorescing (having high Score A) if it still stands after testing.</P><P>Part 2. Whether <B>destabilized minispanich</B> can be <B>re-stabilized</B> by target RNA(inducible v.s. uninducible)
</P><P>Only considering the destabilizing on the minispanich is insufficient, as a probe that has to be induce-fluoresce is not necessarily inducible. Therefore, we would also like to have another score that allows us to identify those design that are more likely to be inducible, considering the ON/OFF ratio as the read out in our wet lab experiment that tells whether the probe is inducible.</P><P>Considering that the formation of heterodimer between the aptamer and target is in equilibrium, while the free energy (Delta G value) is related to thermodynamic stability, we selected the minimal free energy (<B>MFE</B>) of <B>Aptamer-Target Heterodimer</B> and <B>Target-Target Homodimer</B>, and the value of delta G for heterodimer binding to be plotted against the ON/OFF ratio to construct a best fit (smallest R2) equation using multiple linear regression. Also, we include frequency of the MFE structure in the ensemble, which may be related with the structural stability of the Aptamer-Target Heterodimer, in the multiple linear regression as a candidate that is related with the structural dynamics of the assembled heterodimer. The best fit equation to our data set (N=15) is found to be:</P><P>f(Score I)=3.71(MFE of aptamer monomer)+3.37(MFE of target monomer)-3.42(MFE of aptamer-target homodimer)+3.61(Delta G for heterodimer binding)+5.24(The frequency of the MFE structure in the ensemble)</P><P>The Score I shows positive correlation with the ON/OFF ratio, that those aptamer design having high Score I are more likely to be inducible. However, there are point that defect from the predicted trend and the R2 value only reaches 0.27. </P><P>This is not very surprising as a limitation of the regression plot only consider the variable included in the equation, while in the “turn-on” event, we only includes representative for molecular dynamics between aptamer and target, as well as representative for structural dynamics (The frequency of the MFE structure in the ensemble), but there is no representative for the molecular dynamics that account for the binding event of the heterodimer with DFHBI due to difficulties in predicting the interaction between an RNA and a small molecule (which is not an RNA).
</P><P>Summary</P><P>Although the R2 value for both scoring methods are not high, they are still far from random. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that they have the potential to assist a rational design for minispanich aptamers that is more likely to be induced-fluoresce and inducible, and allows automated screening of aptamer designs along a long RNA sequence in the future by:</P><OL style="font-size:14pt"><LI>generate all possible aptamer design by sliding window of 22 nucleotide on a long RNA sequence that determines the variable domain of the minispanich aptamer probe</LI><LI>eliminate those are likely to be auto-fluoresing</LI><LI>select those are likely to be inducible</LI></OL><P>Reference:</P><OL type="1" style="font-size:14pt"><LI> W.
