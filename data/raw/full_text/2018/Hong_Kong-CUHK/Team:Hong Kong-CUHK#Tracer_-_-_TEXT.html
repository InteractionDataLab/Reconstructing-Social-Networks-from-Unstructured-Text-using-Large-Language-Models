Tracer
Tracer is a mobile-phone base fluorometer which is designed to be cheap, convenient and user-friendly for the public. It has the name tracer because firstly, it is designed to catch the fluorescent signal given out by our RNA probe after it encounters influenza virus RNA; and secondly, since the device is intended for the general public in the local community, we hope that through our system we can be able to trace the influenza virus distribution in the local area, and even globally in the future. Through this method itâ€™s hopeful that we can achieve disease control in the larger area.
