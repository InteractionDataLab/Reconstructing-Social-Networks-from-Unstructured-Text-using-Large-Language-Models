Best Applied Design Special Prize
Transmissible disease like influenza has caused a lot of deaths not only in Hong Kong but also worldwide. However, the symptoms of flu are hard to differentiate and the distribution and transmission of flu is hard to monitor if it is solely relied on hospitals and clinics. In our project, we are trying a develop a cheap, fast and convenient tool for the general public to achieve self-detection of influenza and a accurate and timely disease monitor for the local community. Our wet lab developed a RNA aptamer which will give out fluorescent signal under the simulation of blue light. The signal can be captured using mobile phone by simply taking a picture. The user can get the results after uploading that to our software. As they upload the picture we also collect their information like location and symptoms to help achieve disease monitoring and control in the local area.
