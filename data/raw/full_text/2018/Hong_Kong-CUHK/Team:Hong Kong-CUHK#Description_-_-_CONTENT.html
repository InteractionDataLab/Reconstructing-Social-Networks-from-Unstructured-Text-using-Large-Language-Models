In Hong Kong, influenza A has the potential to be spread quickly and widely in poultry flocks and sometimes transmits to human, which often causes severe pandemic, causing the illness and deaths of many. The most notorious pandemic was the “Spanish Flu” in 1918, which killed 50 million people worldwide (1). Influenza A poses enormous societal and economic burden. It is estimated that around $90 billion US dollars and 600,000 lives are lost to influenza A every year in the States (2). Influenza A can be classified according to the types of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) on the virus surface. With 16 types of HA and 9 types of NA, 144 subtypes of Influenza A are possible. influenza A properties can vary with different subtypes. The difference in mortality rates of H5N1 and H1N1 infection, for example, shows that subtyping can be critical in monitoring a potential epidemic.</P></DIV><H3>Conventional and novel methods of influenza diagnosis</H3><DIV style="box-shadow: 1px 4px 8px 1px rgba(1, 1, 1, 0.4);padding:15px;"><P>To prevent the spread of pandemic, appropriate treatment is best taken within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms (3). Therefore, a rapid and accurate on-site detection method is required. However, nowadays on-site diagnostic method, such as Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Tests (RIDTs), can only identify the influenza A virus but cannot subtype it (4). Typical subtyping relies greatly on RT-PCR, which requires expertise and complicated laboratory set-up; newer on-site subtyping technology utilizing gold nanoparticles or antibodies lack design flexibility and remain too expensive for mass production. Toehold switch, an artificial RNA biosensor first developed in 2014 by Green et al, is a forward engineered mRNA secondary structure that allows the translation of downstream protein coding sequence when a specific trigger RNA binds to it (5). The trigger RNA binds to the switch region of the toehold linearizes toehold secondary structure. This then releases the Ribosomal Binding Site (RBS) from the loop, allowing a ribosome to bind on. The ribosome can then read along the coding region of the toehold switch, hence giving off a protein chosen by the user. </P></DIV><H3>Fallbacks of Our Previous Project – Toehold Switches</H3><DIV style="box-shadow: 1px 4px 8px 1px rgba(1, 1, 1, 0.4);padding:15px;"><P>With the recent advance of cell-free translation system expressing RNA detecting probe, a solution to the problems aforementioned is presented, but development of this technique requires further improvements to provide signal discrimination and accuracy. For example, when the iGEM 2017 CUHK team utilized red fluorescent protein (RFP) as a reporter for detecting influenza A subtypes, the development of signals took an overnight culture; when Collins et al. utilized lacZ hydrolase as a reporter, a 2-hour long RNA amplification process is required to shorten the total reporting time to 4 hour (6,7). These data present signal visualization as a main hindrance in the development of this technology. However, as the action time of protein reporters are restricted by translation and protein folding, our team aims to search for a optimal reporter by RNA instead of protein, as for a better and expertise-free detection methods, to maximise the on-site potential of this technology.</P></DIV><H3>RNA Reporters</H3><DIV style="box-shadow: 1px 4px 8px 1px rgba(1, 1, 1, 0.4);padding:15px;"><P>To develop a rapid, cheap, and on-site system of influenza diagnosis, we have chosen nucleic acid-based reporters, instead of protein-based (e.g. toehold switches). From the array of nucleic acid reporters, such as molecular beacons, DNAzymes, we have chosen the light-up RNA aptamers.</P><P>Aptamers refer to oligonucleotides or peptides that can specifically bind to a ligand, such as proteins, small molecules and even E. coli. Light-up RNA aptamers refer to aptamers that bind to a specific fluorogen that does not fluoresce on its own, but fluoresce upon the binding or docking of the RNA aptamer. Since the first invention of the light up RNA aptamer, malachite green aptamer, a variety of light-up RNA aptamers have been flourishing the field of live-cell imaging, DNA computation and diagnosis. The discovery of light-up RNA aptamers is achieved by a process called Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), which is testing the binding of randomly generated RNA molecules against a potential fluorogen and selecting the best ones as templates for next round of RNA generation. The ones which exhibit the strongest on/off ratio of fluorescence is chosen for downstream applications [8].</P></DIV><H3>The Spinach RNA Aptamer</H3><DIV style="box-shadow: 1px 4px 8px 1px rgba(1, 1, 1, 0.4);padding:15px;"><P>One of the most famous light-up RNA aptamers that was invented in 2011 by Paige et. al. is the Spinach aptamer. Its cognate fluorogen 3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI) is derived by the chromophore of green fluorescent protein (GFP) [9]. This aptamer has the brightness that could compare to its protein inspiration and can be expressed in E. coli for live-cell imaging as the organic DFHBI can directly pass across the membrane and bind to the aptamer.</P><P>The emergence of Spinach aptamer triggered the development of the alternate versions of the aptamer for various applications. By disrupting the proper folding of the aptamer and connect it to another module that is sensitive to its detecting target, such as ATP or a specific RNA sequence, the correct folding can be triggered to give off a signal; by connecting the aptamer to a self-cleaving ribozyme, it can be used to monitor progress of in vitro transcription [8]. </P></DIV><H3>Split Light-Up RNA Aptamers</H3><DIV style="box-shadow: 1px 4px 8px 1px rgba(1, 1, 1, 0.4);padding:15px;"><P>By splitting the Spinach aptamer into 2 or more parts for contributing to its formation, a RNA AND logic gate can be constructed. In previous attempts constructing a split light-up RNA aptamer, none of the probes are proved to be truly modulable to fit its application into any RNA sequence. Split-Broccoli has a high ON/OFF ratio upon the binding of the 2 separate sequences, but it is limited to its own sequence; the universal split spinach probe can be used to detect virtually any sequence, but it involves a RNA-DNA hybrid [10,11]. Looking into the designs of previous designs, they can be classified into three categories: destabilizing folding, inducing misfolding and further splitting. </P></DIV><H3>For our RNA Aptamer Probe targeting influenza sequences, we have chosen the destabilized Spinach aptamer for our design.</H3><DIV style="box-shadow: 1px 4px 8px 1px rgba(1, 1, 1, 0.4);padding:15px;"><P>Using this design, we have developed several probes for the influenza A hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and polymerase basic 2 genes, which is chosen either for subtyping and influenza detection. The fluorescence data generated with these tools will allow diagnosis for personal treatment and epidemic monitoring at the same time.</P></DIV><H3>Tracer – The Accompanying Tool for RNA Aptamer Probe</H3></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><H3>References</H3><DIV style="box-shadow: 1px 4px 8px 1px rgba(1, 1, 1, 0.4);padding:15px;"><OL style="font-size:14px;"><LI>Global Influenza Programme [Internet].
