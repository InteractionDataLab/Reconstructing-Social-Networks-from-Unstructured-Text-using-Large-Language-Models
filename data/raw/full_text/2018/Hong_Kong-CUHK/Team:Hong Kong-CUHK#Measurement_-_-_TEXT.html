Best Innovation in Measurement Special Prize
We think our team has done excellent job in measuring in both wet lab and dry lab. For wet lab, we measured the effect of time, temperature, 4 ion concentrations, strand concentration to the signal development of our RNA aptamer probe in vitro. While the characterizations are informative, they also provided insights to how the probes will be applied in real life. For dry lab, we have developed a hardware called tracer which can achieve calibration and fluorescent signal measuring. it does not only records the information of light intensity but also the information of the light distribution and color pattern. And our software can calibrate and analyze the signal using the method of machine learning. Also, we have developed a website to collect information and measure the disease distribution in the local area, which can have great significance in local disease control.
