Influenza, as the most infectious disease in modern world, has posed great threat to the general public, especially to underprivileged regions with poor hygiene standard and inadequate primary healthcare protection.  The existing quick-response test for influenza virus are still far away from being a popular diagnostic test for its unsatisfying accuracy and great expenses. In the light of this, it is to our belief that there is increasing demand and dire need for a RELIABLE and AFFORDABLE influenza quick-response test.
After evaluating the risk and potentials of the influenza detection kit market (Fig1), a tentative timeline has been set.(Fig2)
Fig1: SWOT Analysis
Fig2: Timeline
To commercialise our product, we have started the search for angel investors and funding, while in active preparation of our patent application.   We aspire that with the increasing popularity and improvement in production techniques, our company could be self-sustainable from the revenue of the influenza test kit in 5 yearsâ€™ time.(Fig3 & Fig4)
Fig3: Cost Sheet
Fig4: Payback Period Analysis
With reference from detailed market research and market forecast (Fig5), it is expected that we would reach payback period within 4 years. The profit could not only be used for R&D of the detection kit, but also be invested in low-risk financial instruments to secure future fundings for the company.
Fig5: Porter's five forces analysis
We foresee that in long term, our product would gain global recognition and be adopted for field-work in international humanitarian work or epidemic outbreak management.  In order to develop into a reputed and sustainable MNE, we foresee the future challenges and risks such as patent application, foreign regulation and exchange risk. (Fig6)
