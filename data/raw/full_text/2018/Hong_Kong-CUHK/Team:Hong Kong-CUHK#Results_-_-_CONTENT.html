It can also be subjectively determined by visibility, though it might be less valid. Minimum amount of target RNA required to obtain a visually distinguishable difference between positive and negative signal was investigated by using 2 model aptamer probes, N2-694 and N9-545, as they represent a less sensitive and a noisier probe respectively. Reaction mixture was set with 2uM probe but in different concentration of target (i.e. 1.5uM, 1uM, 0.5uM, 0.2uM, 0.05uM).</P><P style="font-size:17px">Visually, for N2 probe, more than 0.2uM of target is necessary to visualize the difference, while ~0.2-0.5uM of target is required for N9 probe visualization.

Optimization of Aptamer Assay Condition</H3><DIV><P>We were able to monitor the change in fluorescence signal and the time required for signal development using real-time PCR system. N9-694 and N2-545 probes were used. </P><P>It was shown that our aptamer-probe pairs generally require only 10 minutes of cooling to give out a detectable signal, which is around 75 degrees Celsius. (Fig 3.1)</P><FIGCAPTION style="font-size:15px;"><CENTER><I>Fig.3.1 Time and Temperature for signal development of N9 and N2 probes.

Surprisingly, the melting curve shows that the fluorescence intensity drops quickly at 18-35 degrees Celsius, which does not correspond to the previous data. However, this might be caused by the assymetry of association and dissociation kinetics of DFHBI docking, which was never studied in the previous literature. Another interesting point is that both miniSpinach and aptamer-target pairs share 2 melting temperatures, suggesting a two-step mechanism of DFHBI docking. Nevertheless, the temperature where the probe achieves optimal performance is around 18 degrees Celsius, while room temperature incubation can also achieve a very goof fluorescence signal, which is user-friendly (See Fig 3.2)</P><FIGCAPTION style="font-size:15px;"><CENTER><I>Fig.3.2 Melting curves of N9 and N2 probes.

E. coli Expression Test</H3><DIV><P>When we co-expressed the probes and targets in <I>E. coli</I> BL21 Star (DE3) provided by [https://2018.igem.org/Team:Hong_Kong-CUHK/Collaborations NUS Singapore-A team], we did not observe the expected ON/OFF ratio as seen in the in vitro experiments. While we initially hypothesized that this might be due to the low expression level of the probes and the target, as the positive control had low fluorescence comparing to blank as well, we performed total RNA extraction and used the RNA amount that is equivalent to the cell number for in-cell assay. To our surprise, we observed a 7-fold recovery of the fluorescence level of the positive control in total RNA, while none of that was observed in the probe + target pairs. Based on the results, we concluded that while aptamer folding without tRNA scaffold is unfavorable in E. coli, probe target hybridization is inhibited by the terminator following the aptamer. Please note that the design of this assay is following Ong et. al. 2017, showing that the data from the paper might not be accurate. However, due to the lack of time, we did not perform further alterations to improve the design (Fig. 4).</P><FIGCAPTION style="font-size:15px;"><CENTER><I>Fig.4 E. coli Probe expression test.
