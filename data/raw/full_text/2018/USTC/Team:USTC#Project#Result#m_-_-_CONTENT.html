The RFI curve of JTPI on pSB1C3 indicated that the leaky expression of LuxI in JTPI on pSB1C3 was too severe, resulting in high expression of GFP. At the same time, the growth curve showed that the bacterial density was lower compared with others, indicating too much growth pressure of E. coli because of the leaky expression of LuxI. For these reasons, inserting JTPI into pSB1C3 was not a good solution for controlling expression leakage.</P><P class="card-text">(b)	JTP on pSB1C3 is a plasmid constructed by inserting JTP into pSB1C3 with GFP downstream. The RFI curve of JTP on pSB1C3 indicated that the low expression of green fluorescent protein was due to the absence of  LuxI gene. Meanwhile, the growth curve indicated that the growth pressure of E. coli was not so severe, so bacterial density was higher than JTPI on pSB1C3.</P><P class="card-text">(c)	 JTPI on pET28 is a plasmid in which we inserted JTPI into pET28 with GFP downstream. As far as we know, the copy number of pET28 is less than the copy number of pSB1C3. The comparison of the RFI curve of JTPI on pET28 with JTP on pSB1C3 indicated that it can meet the needs of our regulation system. At the same time, the growth curve of JTPI on pET28 was not much different compared with the growth curve of JTP on pSB1C3, so the growth pressure of E. coli was not so severe. For these reasons, we can decrease expression leakage via inserting JTPI into pET28.</P><P class="card-text">In summary, we decided to insert JTPI into pET28 and we finally successfully constructed this plasmid.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="card"><DIV class="card-body"><H4 class="card-title">Degradation system</H4><DIV class="card"><H4 class="card-header">1.
