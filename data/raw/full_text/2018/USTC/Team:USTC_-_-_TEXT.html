Abstract
3-succinoyl-pyridin (SP) is an important precursor of antihypertensive drugs. SP is not                                 easy to obtain and thus makes it expensive. Fortunately, some researchers found a way                                 to transform nicotine to SP.
Nicotine is a highly addictive chemical and its addiction is comparable to well-known                                 psychological drugs like heroin, cocaine. Uptake of nicotine may promote the abnormal                                 release of neural messengers, which cause emotional and physiological disorders. As a                                 form of alkaloid, many plants such as Tobacco contain abundant nicotine
As a well-known industrial crop, tobacco is widely plant around the world. Mature                                 tobacco can be used as the raw material for cigarette industry which accounts for an                                 unsubstitutable portion in Chinaâ€™s economy.
The tobacco leaves are roasted, cut into lumps, and then sliced and rolled into                                 cigarettes. In this production process, there will be a large number of waste produced                                 by tobacco leaves. Some chemicals like nicotine is included in these tobacco waste.
This year, our team designed three systems in E.coli K12 to transform nicotine to SP.                                 The three systems are sensor system, regulation system and degradation system, whose                                 gene elements are constructed on two plasmid backbones separately.
