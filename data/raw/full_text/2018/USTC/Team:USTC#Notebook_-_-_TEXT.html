January
We found a new team—USTC 2018! At the end of the term, the new team members gathered together in                       the 363 lab, where we will start and finish our project this year. The old members shows fresh                       men how to do molecular experiments and edit gene. Wow, we are just ready to make some amazing                       things.
February
All the members are divided into different groups before winter holiday                       begins. The Group leaders pick some excellent project done by other team for new members, which                       make them know the project in the iGEM competition. Then, it’s time for us to think and put                       forward a project ourselves.
        
March
It’s surprised that we have came up with so much novel ideas during the                       brainstorm. All the ideas are so interesting that it’s hard to choose one. So We do research in                       project groups to get further information about each projects.
And here are some ideas that hopefully may become candidates for our project.

JS: Project—From putting forward to giving up
April
We meet once a week and arguing fiercely for the different project. At the end                       of this month, We have selected three candidate projects.
1.Using the QSI system to manage the problems bringing by biofilms
2.Treatment of tobacco waste
3.Governance heavy metals
So we divide team members into three groups again to determine our final                       project.
        
May
We registered the team on the 2018.igem.org and everyone join in the team                       USTC! We really make more research about the three projects and we are confident that we will get                       good results this year for all the projects are amazing. But we need to make a decision as soon                       as possible because of time constraints.
And we begin to make pre-experiment to make sure that we can finish our                       project on time.
Non-biological students are very interested in the experiments of extracting                       plasmid, and we are very happy for the team members improving their experimental skills.
June
Congratulations! We have decided our project “TW”, and now we can concentrate                       on completing our project. But it’s not a good idea for us that our gene circuit is a little bit                       complicated. We have to hurry to do experiment to make sure that we can finish our project on                       time.
As we order the genes of the sensing system from IDT, we plan to construct our                       regulation system firstly.
We meet a few trouble that the gene from the iGEM Distribution Kit is NOT                       right? It cost us some time to choose another gene in the kit. And finally we successfully get                       the correct gene we need at the end of June.

July
The summer holiday has came and we can do experiment in 363 from now on. How                       Wonderful！I believe that we can finish our project on time now.
At the end of July, we almost finish the Regulation System, in the way of                       assembling the Bio-brick from the Kit. I can't wait to see our system work now.

At the same time, we also start to construct the key system—degradation                       system, which includes three enzymes to convert nicotine to useful drugs.

In order to conduct on-the-spot investigations and understand the treatment                         of Tobacco fertilizer in our lives, we used the holiday to visit the Hefei Cigarette Factory                         and do further research. We have learned a lot from it. Details can be found in our Human                         Practice.

And we take part in the Fifth International InterLab Measurement Study. We                         are very delighted that we have completed the work of interlab and got accepted. Hoping that                         our work can make some contributions to the future work of Interlab measurement study.

Of course, sometimes we also encounter some frustrating failures…Like this…

Augest
We have received the gene synthesized by IDT. Now we can start to construct                       our sensing system. But we get nothing when we make PCR using these genes as template. And we                       heard the same unfortunate news from other iGEM teams from China. Oh, it’s too terrible and we                       have to commission another company to synthesis our genes, and the time for us to finish our                       experiment is little.
As we are not very sure which are the most suitable promoter for our sensing                       system, we ask our modeling group for help. But their ideas do not make us satisfied, because it                       will spend too much time. Now JS is nearly mad for he have to try thirty promoters one by one.
At the end of August we go to the ShanghaiTech University to take part in the                       fifth ccic (Conference of China iGEMer Community). We communicated with other iGEM teams, showing                       our project and sharing our experience.

Very lucky, we meet Miss Meagan in ShanghaiTech University. We eat dinner                       together and have a pleasant conversation, talking about our team, our experience and improvement                       in the competition, the development of Synthetic biology in China and the After iGEM for the                       iGEMers.
September
It’s not very good news for us that the summer holiday is over and we haven’t                       finished our project, which means we have less time to stay in the lab than holiday. Fortunately,                       we get some suggestions and help from our seniors whom were iGEMers before. They help us to                       improve our project, especially in our modeling.
Although we are busy in study, we also seen ind time the lab and try to make                       the project better. Thanks to all people’s help, we finally finish our regulation system and                       degradation system, and our sensor is going to be finished.
In this month we share our ideas with our classmates and teachers, talking                       with them the harm of nicotine and what our project can help. They show interest in our systems                       and give some advice about making more people understand our work.
October
