Registration and Jamboree Attendance
We tried our best to realize our project during the summer holiday with great enthusiasm. We also come to attend the Giant Jamboree, sharing our project and learning from other teams’ great ideas!

Competition Deliverables
We have filled out all the forms and pages that are required carefully. Also, we prepared our poster and presentation to show our project to everyone else.

Validated Part
This year we use quorum sensing genes from distribution kit to construct JTPI (BBa_K2768010), which can activate expression of genes downstream. And we also added a positive feedback to make it able to regulate in low AHL concentration. We have proved that this part can activate the expression downstream with positive feedback. You can check it here: http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2768010

Collaboration
We communicated with Team: Fudan, Nanjing-China, XJTU-China, Jilin-China, BNU-China about our projects, and we provided Team: HUST_China with experimental materials they needed. We helped Team: USTC-Software to test their Software and gave them some useful advice. Team Peking helped us in our model. We participated in The 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community and The 6th iGEM Asia-Parcific Conference to show our project and communicate with other teams.

Human Practice
(1) We have been to three tobacco factories (Hefei Cigarette Factory, Zhangzhou Cigarette Factory and Wuhu Cigarette Factory) to research our project. We knew a lot about tobacco and tobacco waste, and we had a fresh understanding of pathway of producing the prodrug. (2) For the purpose of collecting the community’s views about tobacco and propagating iGEM synthetic biology, we designed a questionnaire and have collected hundreds of results. (3) In the “Science Open Weekend”, we opened the lab for thousands of people to visit. (4) We finished a lecture in the high school to publicize iGEM and synthetic biology knowledge. 5. We actively communicated with local high schools and gave them help of founding new iGEM high school teams. 6. We attended the Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference and Central China iGEM Consortium with iGEMers all over the world. 7. Communication and cooperation with some iGEM teams.

Integrated Human Practices
During the visit to the 3 tobacco factories, we have learnt a lot about tobacco industry. We considered to use pure nicotine or nicotine in environment to produce 3-succionylpyridine before, but after the visit, we decided to use tobacco waste as our raw material. Our human practices helped us a lot in our project, making our project more close to real industrial production, and we have designed our whole system based on our human practices.

Improve a Previous Part
We added SsrA tag on the C terminus of Part: E0040, making it a new GFP with fast degradation rate (K2768004)

Model Your Project
(1) Single-cell model is consisted of 22 nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We use Matlab solvers to simulate the change of species concentration along the time. Then we analyze the condition of initial steady state and nicotine sensing state with defined parameters. These results strongly prove the feasibility of our design. (2) We analyze the impact of different combinations of promoter strengths and copy numbers to the initial steady states and outputs with nicotine input. Our simulation results present the tendency of initial state change and the signal shifting. According to these phenomena, we can choose the appropriate promoter combinations and plasmid backbones for the realization of our design. (3) In simulation, we change the value of promoter strength and nicotine input. From the simulation results, we acquire the best time for sampling, signal measurement and product collection. At last, the recycle rate (production rate) is calculated to prove the efficiency of manufacturing.

Demonstration of Your Work
We completed most of our design this year. In Sensing System, we selected the most suitable RBS and promotor for our sensing system under the guidance of modeling groups. We successfully constructed the plasmids and confirmed the transformation. In Regulation System, we constructed the plasmids we needed and plotted RFI curve and growth curve. According to the curves, we have proved our Regulation System is worked. In Degradation System, we constructed plasmids containing the genes of three enzymes separately and together. After confirming transformation, we successfully expressed three enzymes separately and together. In summary, it can be safely concluded that our project work!
