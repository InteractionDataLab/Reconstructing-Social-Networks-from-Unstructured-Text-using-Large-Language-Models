September
week1
We did a full fragment overlap of the arsenic loop and the result failed. Double digestion of pKM586                         vector, plasmid extraction results and double enzyme digestion results are not ideal

week2
We modified the arsenic loop full-segment overlap system and the PCR program, and the results were successful.

Reconstruction of pKM586 original plasmid, the quality of plasmid extraction is not high
week3
Try pKM586 step-by-step double enzyme digestion pre-experiment, resulting in significant improvement                         in cutting efficiency. The arsenic loop complete fragment double digestion and pKM586 double digestion                         product gel recovery, as well as ligation transformation.

October
week1
Transform the successfully constructed plasmid into E. coli BL21, pick a single colony, incubate the                         tube for the first arsenic ion delivery experiment, but the result shows no fluorescence.
Figure 14.the arsenic loop after transformed into BL21
week2
After the successful construction of the plasmid, we began to try to test whether the transformed E.                         coli can express fluorescence after adding arsenic ions. We chose to culture the tube for 6 hours                         and then add different concentrations of arsenic ions for detection. For the second time, we failed                         again.
And we continue to try to change the condition to make it express fluorescence.
