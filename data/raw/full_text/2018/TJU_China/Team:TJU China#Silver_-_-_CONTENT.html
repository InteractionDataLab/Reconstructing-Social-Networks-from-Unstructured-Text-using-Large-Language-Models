        Firstly, as we all know China is a developing country, a large number of pollutions are inevitable, especially some heavy metals in water from metal factories. Secondly, 
        cancer is always a big problem around the world, comparing
        to paying lots of money on the low chance of curing it, the prediction seems to be more significant. So
        with our theory of gene editing and detection, two embryonic thoughts of our projects related to the society came
        out, which are “heavy metal detection in the water” and “high throughput screening of cfDNA of cancer.
    </DIV><DIV class="head1">Communications</DIV><DIV class="comm">During the time we are working on the projects, Junjing Chen went to the 2018 Eurasian meetup to communicate with other
        teams. Chenbo Sun went to Nankai University for a communication which was attended by nine teams. We took an active
        part in the first iGEM Eurasian meetup co-organized by TU Delft and BGI college in Shenzhen, which several other
        teams participated including EPFL, Tongji, HKU and so on. The meetup schedule is similar to that of Giant Jamboree,
        which offered us an opportunity to practice presenting our project. Through the Eurasian meetuo and communication
        in Nankai University, we received useful suggestions on how to improve our projects, and we firmly believe that we
        will do better in the future. Furthermore, we also established strong relationships and built collaboration with
        buddy teams. We received other teams’ advice and figured it out that we can turn our work into products or make the
        results useful to every person, not only to the entire society. </DIV><DIV class="pic_explanation">Figure 1.

Since nobody knows how to develop a model, we
        contacted prof. Mario A. Marchisio from SBSD of Tianjin University, who is an expert in synthetic biology. We communicated
        by emails and also get suggestions when talking to him face to face. Once our projects work, we may develop them
        into products including heavy metal detection and cancer detection in the future.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
