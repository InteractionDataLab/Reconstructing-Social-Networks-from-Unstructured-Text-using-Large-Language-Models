ABSTRACT
     This year, the CRISPR-Cas family is the protagonist in our story series. The old member, dCas9,             is the enhancer for the heavy-metal detection based on E. coli, while the newbie, Cas12a, is a worker for the             high-throughput cancer-related SNP detection chip. We have also built a "highway" for tracking and delivering             the Cas9/sgRNA complex in mammalian cells, and we try to apply it to manipulate the mitochondrial genome.
