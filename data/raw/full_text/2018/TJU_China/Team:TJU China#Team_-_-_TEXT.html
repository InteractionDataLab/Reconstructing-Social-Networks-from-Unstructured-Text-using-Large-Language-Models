We couldn't have accomplished all that we have without the great members in our team.
Extra special thanks to our PIs,Zefang Wang and Haitao Yang, who worked tirelessly to help us. There's some
more awesome people mentioned on the attributions page who helped us on our project but weren't part of our             team.
Team Leaders
Yuqi Song
Chenbo Sun
Yuqi Song
She is the team captain of TJU_Cina iGEM team this year. Needless to say she has been involved with most of the team’s             work such as Group 3 of wet lab, wiki, art supervision and so on. She has worked to her best and has lead the             team to make every efforts to progress. Though she is always strict of work, in daily life she is a barrel of             laughs and always encourages team members during the progress.
“HAHAHAHA”
Chenbo Sun
He is not an outgoing boy, but he likes going outside to see different people and hope to do projects about society.             As the other leader of the team, except for some lab works, his desire to make projects into use contributed             to his ideas and work on human practice. After the iGEM competition, he intends to work hard on grades and do             sports to recover his health.
“BOOM SHAKALAKA”
Team Members
Junjing Chen
Linpeng Chen
Mengqi Li
Mengyao Lin
Junjing Chen
Junjing works as a libero in the whole team. Having been in experiment group, HP group and doing standard biological             parts , she is always ready to fill any vacancy. And now she is preparing the presentation to show how best her             team is!
“Man proposes, god disposes.”
Linpeng Chen
Lin Peng is the best assistant to the leader of the Group 2. He is very careful in the experiment (just complementing             the leader of group 2) and active in the task completion. Just like the way he looks, Lin Peng is a reliable             man. Over the summer he has been carrying out wet lab work meticulously with a very steady hand on the micropipette             day and night.
Mengqi Li
As the leader of Group 3 of wet lab, she is enthusiastic about the experiment and always has a highly responsible             attitude towards it. She has been involved mostly in the digestion of DNA outside the cells part of the project.             Her creative mind has helped the team a lot in the construction of wiki, presentation and other related work.
Mengyao Lin
She has been involved with the construction of the amplification circuit in the project about heavy metal detection             in group 1 of wet lab. What she needs to do is to design the appropriate sgRNA according to the target sequence             and replace a small 30 bp sequence onto the support plasmid by ligation.
“The earth has music for those who listen.”
Mengyuan Lv
Minghui Yin
Muchan Gao
Peicheng Li
Mengyuan Lv
As a experimenter of Group 1 of wet lab, her main work is the construction of vector and fluorescence detection of             arsenic ions. And in our laboratory, she always loves joking, with strange laughter which often shocks others.
“I don't believe in fortune, but my effort.”
Minghui Yin
She is a junior in school of life sciences but is primarily responsible for building dynamic models of heavy metal             biosensors. In this process, she is often convinced by the power of MATLAB.
"If you don't know how to achieve it, try MATLAB."
Muchan Gao
She focuses on plasmid construction and fluorescence detection as well as the design of the initial loop in the Group             1 of wet lab. At the same time, she also participated in HP activities, combining our results with reality and             doing something for environmental protection.
“PCR is an art.”
Peicheng Li
He is a combination of coder and player, and his job is making the wiki of the IGEM. As a handsome guy, he often             makes girls only have eyes for him. In his spare time, he enjoys playing computer games and making his own games.
“God is always unfair, who makes talented man considerate and calm just like him.”
Wenzhong Teng
Xiaoyu Yang
Xinyi Wang
Xuechun Gao
Wenzhong Teng
He is mainly responsible for purifying Cas9 protein and detecting its activity in order to make sure that it works             well in the downstream experiments in Group 3 of wet lab and is the master of these processes. Having been very             committed to the project, he enjoys the experiments very much.
Xiaoyu Yang
As a fan of molecular biology, Xiaoyu is committed to the completion of the molecular cloning of the team and completed             the part construction. Besides, she joins the presentation group to present the team's glory on the stage. For             more, her hobby of taking photos allowed her to take on the team’s photography work together with Junjing.
Xinyi Wang
Xinyi is an active and open-minded girl who works on Standard Biologocal Parts and cultivating a new method of diagnosis             of cancer markers in a high-throughput, accurate, quick and handy manner.
Xuechun Gao
As the leader of the Group 2 of wet lab, Xue Chun not only arranged the tasks well, but also felt like ducks to water             in the dry experiment as well as the wet experiment (although sometimes she was careless and lazy when doing             experiments, for example, there was always a pile of EP tubes with no name in the drawer of the Group 2), but             thanks to her, the experiment in the Group 2 has always been the most successful.
Yiran Cheng
Yuhao Qiu
Xinzhao Sun
Zheng Hu
Yiran Cheng
Although she’s only seventeen, Yiran is a very necessary member in experimental group because she’s mostly willing             to wash hundreds of test tubes. Actually she’s not good at gene editing technology as the elders(or maybe disastrously             bad), but this little girl is really optimistic: Even the deadline comes tomorrow or was seriously scolded by             teacher last night, she can sleep till nine, then of course, finish her task as quickly as possible. She’s creative             and never afraid of failure.
“Nothing is impossible”
Yuhao Qiu
She is an experimenter in this team. Her area of expertise is research. Having looked into mitochondrial disease             and  mitochondrial gene editing, she plans to utilise the CRISPR-Cas9 system to eliminate abnormal mutanted mtDNA             and cure mitochondrial diseases.
“Nothing is impossible for a willing heart.”
Xinzhao Sun
His takes the responsibility of purifying the Cas12a protein and constructing the fusion protein of Cas12a protein             and hydrophobic protein.
“I’m going to throw agarose gel on the PI's face.”
Zheng Hu
He is one of our model designers, who believes all phenomena can be described by an ingenious model. Focusing on             directing and predicting the experiment, he was addicted in the parameters interaction and applied mathematic             tools in biological problem solving.
“Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, willseek to enter in, and shall not be able.”
Team Advisors
Dongqi Bao
Zhongyi Jiang
Zhuozhi Chen
Dongqi Bao
Dongqi is our advisor for modelling. She is now a Master student of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at ETH             Zurich. She was a member of iGEM Tianjin 2014 and a co-leader of iGEM Tianjin 2015 and a judge of iGEM 2017.
"Life is short; I do science."
Zhongyi Jiang
Zhongyi is one of our advisors mainly focus on giving help and suggestions of team affairs. He helped in setting             up the team and recruiting our members for this year, and acted as a temporary leader for the very first time.             As the leader of TJU_China 2017, he uses his experience to improve the group till the whole team can run well.
“Even though it's not who I am, I'm not afraid of who I used to be”
Zhuozhi Chen
Zhuozhi is a student advisor mainly responsible for educating team members with relevant experimental techniques             and biological rationale, for instructing students who are stuck in their daily experiments or in generating             any ideas, also for assisting the professor in organizing daily routine as well as coordinating personnel changes.
