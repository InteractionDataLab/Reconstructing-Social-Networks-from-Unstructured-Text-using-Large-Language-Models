Isolation and Characterization of Endophytic Bacteria
Our team isolated and characterized 39 strains of endophytic bacteria harbored in the roots of the wild grass Arrhenatherum elatius and the cultivated bioenergy crop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). These strains were evaluated for resistance to chloramphenicol and streptomycin using the Kirby-Bauer test (Susceptible, Intermediate, or Resistant). Additionally, strains were tested for ACC utilization by plating on DF-ACC agar plates. We measured strain growth rates, with OD600 10X dilution after 18 hrs incubation at 30°C. Risk group was determined based on classification by 16S amplification and sequencing.
Table 1: Characteristics of evaluated strains.
KB Antibiotic Key: R = resistant; S = susceptible; I = intermediately susceptible/resistant

Transformation of endophytic bacteria
After a series of transformation attempts, a transformation protocol was developed which could be consistently used. About 25-50% of colonies on later plates are transformants.

Plant persistence tests
A key test of the effectiveness of an endophyte to impact its host if the endophyte can persist in and on the plant. FCP2-01 was isolated from the roots, and therefore we examined ability for the endophyte to inhabit the roots of Brachypodium distachyon. Seeds were inoculated by submerging in bacterial culture, then grown axenically in glass culture tubes in a growth chamber. Confocal micrographs were acquired at intervals of 1 week for 1-5 weeks post-inoculation. Bacteria were observed on roots at weeks 3 and 4 most clearly, but overwatering may have been responsible for no visible colonies in week 5.

Next Steps
Demonstrate expression and activity of acdS in FCP2-01
Develop a regulation system based on abscisic acid to turn on only in drought
Inoculate B. distachyon and measure effects of FCP2-01 expressing acdS on plant growth and yield under osmotic stresses
Test transformation protocol on additional endophytic isolates of grasses
Evaluate ability for endophytic bacteria to enter roots, and how endophytic fungi may affect this process
Test species specificity of FCP2-01 and ability to horizontally transmit between a plant and a neighbor
Pathogenicity screens of FCP2-01 and more complete evaluation of antibiotic resistance
Review genomes of Enterobacter ludwigii for insights into plasmid stability and other factors affecting biotechnology potential
Field trials of FCP2-01 (if the strain is cleared as safe) to test persistence and physiological effects in real-world applications
Project Achievements
Successful Results
Isolation and screening of endophytic bacterial isolates provided a diversity of strains and for synthetic biology experimentation.
A transformation protocol was developed for a endophytic bacteria, which provides a chassis for affecting plant physiology without engineering the plant
Reinfection and persistence were observed in a distantly related grass 51.6 ± 7.9 (SD) million years since divergence (Vicentini et al. 2008). FCP2-01 is capable of stably expressing a fusion protein of acdS and GFP for at least 4 weeks in the plant.
Modeling
Unsuccessful results
Most transformations did not work. We were unable to transform and express any of our vectors in Pseudomonas spp. Attempts at transformation via conjugation were also unsuccessful.
Due to timeline disruptions by unviable seeds, we were unable to evaluate the effect of engineered FCP2-01 on plant growth
None of our engineered strain could grow with ACC as the only available nitrogen source. It is possible that the attachment of a GFP tag (used for identifying transformed colonies and visualizing bacteria in and on roots) disrupted the quaternary structure of the ACC deaminase tetramer.
