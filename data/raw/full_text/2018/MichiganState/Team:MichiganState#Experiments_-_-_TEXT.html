Transformation of Enterobacter ludwigii FCP2-01
Materials
Electrocompetent FCP2-01 cells
1 mm electroporation cuvettes, chilled on ice
Plasmid DNA, works well with 100 ng per sample
SOC media
LB plates with antibiotic for selection
Methods
Thaw FCP2-01 cells on ice if using them out of the freezer.
Add 100 μl of cells to cuvettes on ice.
Add ~ 100 ng of plasmid DNA to cells, incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
Electroporate at 1.8 kV, add 1 mL SOC.
Incubate for 1 hr in cuvette at 30°C, warm plates to 30°C.
Spread 100 μl of cells on LB plates, incubate 24-48 hrs to see colonies.
Note: Some colonies grow which may not be transformed. It is therefore useful to include a fluorescent protein marker.
Characterization of endophytic isolates
Optical Density (OD) at 600nm as measure of growth rate
Overnight cultures in 6 mL LB were inoculated from colonies on solid media and grown for 24 hours at 30°C. These cultures were then diluted to a standard  OD and a plastic inoculation loop was used to inoculate a second 6 mL LB culture. After 24 hours at 30°C, The 1/10 diluted OD was measured.
Susceptibility
Cultures grown overnight at 30°C in 6 mL LB were streaked to form a lawn on MH plates. Sterile paper disks were soaked in either 35 mg/ml chloramphenicol  or came pre-treated with streptomycin. The disks were placed on the streaked plates are incubated at 30°C for 24 hours. The radius of clearance was measured are  compared to standards.
ACC utilization
Overnight cultures of isolates were streaked onto DF-ACC agar without  MoO3 to prevent nitrogen acquisition via fixation. After 2 days on these plates, presence or absence of growth was recorded.
Sequencing
The 16S region of the bacterial isolates was amplified using the universal bacterial primers 27F and 1492R. Polymerases Q5, Phusion, or Taq were used for amplification. PCR products were processed for sequencing via reaction with Exonuclease I and Antarctic Phosphatase. Sanger sequencing using 27F was performed at the MSU Genomics Core.
