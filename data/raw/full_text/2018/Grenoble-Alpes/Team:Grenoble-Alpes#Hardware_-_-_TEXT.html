DEMONSTRATE
In order to fully automate the whole biological process we need to be able to perform 4 main actions  :
pipette liquid in and out of Eppendorf tubes
control the temperature of the samples
extract the DNA after the bacteriophages lysis step
measure the fluorescence at the end of the process in order to get a diagnosis
To control those actions we use an Arduino microcontroller to handle the different electronic components and a raspberry pi (a very small and cheap computer) to display the results and interact with the user
The whole process takes place in a structure made of aluminum and Plexiglas.  The samples, buffers and pipette tips are placed on a central rotating plate that moves thanks to a motor controlled via our Arduino.
This circular structure is very convenient because it optimizes the space used and does not require to move the different modules, reducing the complexity of the system.
