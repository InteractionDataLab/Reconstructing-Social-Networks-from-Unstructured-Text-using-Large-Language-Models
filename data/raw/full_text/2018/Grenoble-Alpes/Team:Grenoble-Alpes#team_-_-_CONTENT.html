“Last year, I had the chance to be part of iGEM as a team member. This experience was one of the most enriching experience of my life. This year, to my great surprise, the Grenoble team adopted me and I became their advisor. Being an advisor is quite a peculiar feeling and I am very proud of being able to help them move forward. This status allows me to live an entirely different iGEM experience! Science is a discipline where share and passion are master words. I hope to be able to bring them a bit of that. This year team is very passionate and full of ambitions. I am certain that they will go further than they think.”

My conception of school is a place where students are more motivated to learn than teachers to teach. I noticed that last summer. .. Thus all is said about my motivation as a teacher...

As a scientist, synthetic biology is a wonderful domain where creativity is endless.
Synthetic biology may be an essential source of progress related to environmental and societal impact along with ethical and philosophical concerns, which is closely connected to Albert Einstein's vision and my own scientific one.
