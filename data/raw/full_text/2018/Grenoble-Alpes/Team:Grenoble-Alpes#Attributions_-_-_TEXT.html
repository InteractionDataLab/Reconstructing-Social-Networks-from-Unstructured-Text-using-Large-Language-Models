COLLABORATIONS
Through this page, we want to explain the role that each team member has had within the project. We want also to make known, and thank, the other actors of the project who participated in its smooth running.
But before that we will present rapidly our iGEM Grenoble history!
iGEM GRENOBLE-ALPES STORY
1) How did we know iGEM ?
We have never had lessons on iGEM but each member of the team has heard about the competition at Grenoble Alpes University (UGA) or Grenoble INP school, by the members of the previous team and the teachers who took them framed.
Then, the team met last November via Pierre Cavailles (the main advisor and a biotechnology teacher at the UGA), and that's how the story started.
2) Project Chronology
You can find, in the diagram below, the chronology of the project which summarizes the key points of our work.
ATTRIBUTIONS
This part describes the work done, and the person who performed it.
