Characterization/Contribution
✔
This year, we characterized BBa_J04450 which was a part of our detection system. We wanted to know in which E. Coli strain we would obtain the highest fluorescence rate and also if there was a difference of leaky expression of the promoter between the strains. We thus did a fluorescence kinetics in three different host E. Coli strains (TOP10, DH5α and BL21) to observe the apparition of fluorescence and we also studied the influence of IPTG, which allowed us to describe the size of the leak in these three strains.(see details here )
