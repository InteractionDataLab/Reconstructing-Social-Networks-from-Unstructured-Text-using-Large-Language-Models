After working on this model for some time we reached out to Ruth Bentley from the Nottingham iGEM team, we were able to work together and to discuss different modeling aspects. </P><P>

As we can see after a small time where the phages population is steady it quickly rises. This small time is the result of the time needed by the phage to multiply and kill its host after infection. This time is called the <I>latent time</I> T<SUB>L</SUB>.
Once there are enough phages the bacteria population start to decline due to the multiple phages-induced lytic cycles. In this modeling (with no phage-resistant bacteria factor) we can see that there are no more bacteria after 23 hours.
As soon as bacteria are killed their DNA is released into the solution, this DNA will then be degraded over time.
Finally, we can see here that the bacteria population is equal to the carrying capacity (and the number of bacteria in a “no phages” situation) for a certain amount of time, then starts to decline.
This “typing point” is in fact reached when the phages-bacteria ratio is high enough.
In this article[1] the authors already highlighted this threshold: “the concentration of susceptible bacteria can only decline if the concentration of free phages exceeds the inundation threshold V<SUB>I</SUB>”. In our modelling with our equations this threshold is equal to:</P><H3>4) Fast growing bacteria</H3><FIGURE><CENTER><FIGCAPTION>Figure 10: Growths in case of fast growing bacteria over 24h</FIGCAPTION></CENTER></FIGURE><P>When we change the growing rate of our bacteria it is interesting to see that the time necessary to eradicate the bacteria is actually smaller than in the average behaviour modelling. This can be explained by the fact that when the growing rate is higher the bacteria population is close to the carrying capacity for a longer time. 
As a result there are more phages-bacteria interactions and more phages produced, which in the end eradicate the bacteria more rapidly.
</P><H3>5) High phages multiplication rate</H3><FIGURE><CENTER><FIGCAPTION>Figure 11: Growths in high phages multiplication rate over 24h </FIGCAPTION></CENTER></FIGURE><P>With a higher phages multiplication rate even less time is needed to eradicate the bacteria population.</P><P>
We can also see here two “bumps” in the number of phages and DNA released, they occur after one and two T<SUB>L</SUB> (latent time). Those bumps can be seen because of the very high number of phages released after lysis, called the <I>burst size</I> and set here to 500 instead of 20 for the average behaviour.
</P><H3>6) Slow lysis</H3><FIGURE><CENTER><FIGCAPTION>Figure 12: Growths in slow lysis case over 24h</FIGCAPTION></CENTER></FIGURE><P>In this case we switched the latent time T<SUB>L</SUB> from 36 minutes to 10 hours (compared to the average behaviour). We can here see that the number of phages takes more time to achieve the tipping point where the bacteria population start declining.
The bumps linked to the release of phages after T<SUB>L</SUB> and described in the previous case are also very easy to see here.
</P><H3>7) Low phages binding</H3><FIGURE><CENTER><FIGCAPTION>Figure 13: Growths in low phages binding case over 24h </FIGCAPTION></CENTER></FIGURE><P>In the case of a low phages <I>binding rate K<SUB>i</SUB></I> there is a slower decline of bacteria, or even an equilibrium state with both phages and bacteria as it is the case in this situation.
This shows the importance of the binding rate for a phage therapy.
</P><H3>8) Low carrying capacity</H3><FIGURE><CENTER><FIGCAPTION>Figure 14: Growths in low carrying capacity case over 24h</FIGCAPTION></CENTER></FIGURE><P>Interestingly an equilibrium state can also occur when the carrying capacity is too low. This situation is explained by the fact that the number of infected cells I is equal to the product of the binding rate K<SUB>i</SUB>, the number of phages V and the number of susceptible bacteria S. Therefore if the number of bacteria S is capped by the carrying capacity, the number of phages and infected cell is also limited.
</P><H3>9) <I>C. difficile</I></H3><FIGURE><CENTER><FIGCAPTION>Figure 15: Growths in uneffective phages case over 24h</FIGCAPTION></CENTER></FIGURE><P>This figure shows the result of a phages-bacteria interaction where the phage is not effective at killing the bacteria. This case was inspired by the work of Nottingham 2018 iGEM Team, who worked with lysogenic phages. Lysogenic phages end up by multiplying and killing their host, but not in every case, and with a long latent time.
We implemented this situation in our MATLAB modeling by changing the lysis time, but also by adding a <I>lysis probability</I> factor pL: only in a few percentage of the case will the infection end up in a lytic cycle.
As we can see the phages-bacteria interaction has a cyclic behavior: once the phage reduced the number of bacteria there is an equilibrium phase, but the phages population start to decline due to the phage degradation factor, allowing the bacteria population to rise again.
The rise of the bacteria is not quickly controlled by the phage due to the long latent time. But after a while, the number of phages reaches again the inundation threshold V<SUB>I</SUB> and the bacteria population starts to decline again.
</P><H3>10) <I>C. jejuni</I></H3><FIGURE><CENTER><FIGCAPTION>Figure 16: Growths in case of strongly phage-resistant bacteria over 24h</FIGCAPTION></CENTER></FIGURE><P>Finally we also kept the implementation of the resistant bacteria in our model based on this article[1]. We can see here a case with a strong resistance factor. The number of susceptible bacteria (the one that can be infected by phages) quickly decrease as we have seen before. This allow the phages-resistant bacteria to grow.
However the decrease of the susceptible bacteria population could be enough for a phages therapy: once the total number of bacteria is low enough the immune system of our patient will take over from here and kill the remaining bacteria.
</P><H2>Phages needed for a therapy:</H2><P>Finally Ruth gave us the idea of computing this 3D figure:</P><FIGURE><CENTER><FIGCAPTION> Figure17: 3D phage/bacteria/time link graph </FIGCAPTION></CENTER></FIGURE><P>The idea behind this figure is that the doctor wants to know how much phages he has to administer in order to obtain a certain amount of bacteria after a giving time.</P><P>

From this graph we can actually see pretty easily than the most important factor is the time and not the targeted bacteria population that has to be reached at the targeted time.</P><DIV style="padding:3px; padding-left:6px; border:1px dotted #d0d0d0; border-left:4px solid #d0d0d0; margin-left:20px;"><H3><FONT size="5">REFERENCES</FONT></H3><P><FONT size="3">[1] Cairns BJ, Timms AR, Jansen VAA, Connerton IF, Payne RJH (2009) Quantitative Models of In Vitro Bacteriophage–Host Dynamics and Their Application to Phage Therapy.
