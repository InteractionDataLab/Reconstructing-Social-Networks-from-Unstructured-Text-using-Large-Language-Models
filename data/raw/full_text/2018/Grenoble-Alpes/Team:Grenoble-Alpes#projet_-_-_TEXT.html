Project Abstract
Bacteriophages are viruses that kill specifically - and with a relative efficiency - strains from a bacterial species. They are thus a viable alternative to antibiotics that our fully automated device aims to promote.
Our project is designed to: identify a pathogenic bacterium; detect if this bacterium presents an antibiotic resistance marker; select the most effective bacteriophages for a therapy. As a proof of concept, we targeted Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacteria causing opportunistic lung infections in immunosuppressed patient.
We created DNA probes targeting a housekeeping gene and an antibiotic marker of PAO1.
In parallel, we automated the different processes required for detection with DNA probes: from the DNA extraction after lysis to a fluorescence measurement via a bacterial transformation.
Hence, untrained healthcare professionals will eventually be able to take a sample from a patient, run it through our system, wait for a few hours and get information to decide of a therapy.
