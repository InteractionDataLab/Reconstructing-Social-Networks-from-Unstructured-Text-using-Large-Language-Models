Is our project useful for society ? What are the ethical issues we will face ? We realized videos and essays in order to justify the usefulness of our project and we participated in philosophical debates with people against synthetic biology.
A society issue: antibiotic resistance
This first video introduces the antibiotic resistance issue. Today, many bacteria become resistant to an increasing number of antibiotics, which leads to therapeutic dead-ends. We wanted to fight against critical issues in our society, and the video  demonstrates why antibiotic resistance is a major threat. The video is easy to understand and accessible to everyone.
You were probably already aware of everything we said in our video about antibiotic resistance. If  you want to learn more about resistance to antibiotics and to have a broader view of the problem, feel free to read this first writing, which details why we wanted to fight antibiotic resistance.

A solution: phage therapy
A solution is phage therapy. Phage therapy may be a great alternative to antibiotics. Bacteriophages kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria and prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance. It is not a common therapy in France yet (but researches are being carried out) however it is used in other countries like Georgia and it works well.
Here you can find a really cool video from Kurzgesagt about bacteriophages ! It is easy to understand and accessible to everyone.
In parallel to the video, further explanations are given in the second writing, including about our will to promote phage therapy.

Our contribution: PHAGYZER
Once we have understood how hazardous the antibiotic resistance issue is and the potential of phage therapy, we wanted to design an automated system to diagnose the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a sample and to test our bacterial lysis by bacteriophages. But, is our system useful? Are our choices the good ones? We try to justify in our third writing why we have chosen to create this automated system in this manner.
