IGEM PARISIAN MEET-UP
On July 7th, 2018, a Parisian meet-up was organized by the iGEM Pasteur team. It was a great opportunity to meet for the first time 8 other french iGEM teams. We were able to practice our project presentation for the Jamboree and to get more acquainted with other projects for an eventual future collaboration. In Paris, our team was represented by Thomas (team leader and engineer) and Elise (biologist).
