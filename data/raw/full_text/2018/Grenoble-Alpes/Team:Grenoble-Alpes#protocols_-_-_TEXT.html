Methods
Grow bacterial host in LB broth (e.g. 5mL) overnight at 37 °C with agitation (200rpm).
Prepare a bacterial culture with new LB broth adding 1/10 of overnight bacterial host (for example add 3,5mL of overnight
bacterial host in 35mL of new LB broth medium). Mix.
Incubate at 37°C with agitation (200rpm) a few hours or overnight.*
Add a final concentration of 2mM of CaCl2 and MgCl2  (for example add 70µL of CaCl2 1M and 70µL of MgCl2 1M in the 35mL culture). Mix.
Add 100µL of high titer bacteriophage stock (>108 pfu/mL) (the volume can be adapted according the titer).
Mix.
Incubate at 37°C with agitation until lysate clears (disappearance of the turbid) - approximately 5 hours -.
Store at 4°C.

Centrifuge for 15 min at ⩾4,000 x rpm.
Recover the supernatant.
Add a minimum of 0.25 volume of PEG(20%)/NaCl(2.5M) solution (PEG 6000 or 8000 can be used) to the supernatant (e.g. add a minimum of 10mL of PEG/NaCl to for 40mL of supernatant) . Mix (do no vortex).
