Here, you can find the Notebook of each team member. To ease the reading, we classified them using the main themes that each person worked on but of course, we helped each other a lot and sometimes you can find mensions of this and of other activities linked with the iGEM competition in the Notebooks.

Biobrick design (Fanny & Elise)
April
During this month we mainly carried out literature. In fact, we had to define the targets in Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and Staphylococcus Aureus we want to detect. After that, we designed the detection probe of these targets.
May
The first experiments !
We didn’t have yet the 2018 distribution kit so we decided to practice transformation on the 2017 distribution kit. We identified the plasmids of interest and recovered them from the plates.
When we received the distribution kit we started to produce psB1C3-BBa_J04450 and psB1C3-BBa_K592027.

→ Transformation results : no colonies expect for psB1C3-BBa_J04450
→ 2 preculures of psB1C3-BBa_J04450 made
05/25/2018

→ preparation of the french-american workshop
06/18/2018
→ work with Loic on the HP
→ started the design of the rotating part with paper, took the dimensions

to do:
→ See if the wood is going to burn in contact with the heating resistor
06/20/2018
→ test of two serial peltier to see what the evolution of temperature is and if the current is enough to cool down both peltiers (this device works in current so putting them “in series” should be ok - they have the same) - however, the resistors work in voltage - we should put them in parallel
→ Everything went to shit (peltier down) - found a new one
→ Back on a hole plaque - it works - will have to test several peltiers in cascade and the intensity to deliver
06/21/2018
→ got an alim that can deliver 10A
→ wood piece for the prototype were impressed and i tried to put the copper tubes in it but the cooling part isn’t fitting -> will have to file
→ test of the peltier with more intensity but the transistor is getting hot very easily so I took a MOS transistor that has the property to support 60A.
06/22/2018
→ file done, we assembled the different parts of the prototype (rotating part, tubes, resistors, peltier and radiator) and put  rode above to see if the rotation is precise (see video).
→ The plate isn’t well equilibrated and the copper tubes need to be improved to fit and support better the wood plate containing the eppendorf tubes.

→ meeting with biomérieux: new set-up for heating and cooling to reflect on. Extreme loss of conductivity due to the air with the current set-up (copper tube and nut)
→ Next prototype will be made  in PMMA (T° fusion =  130°C ok for the range we have but we will have to avoid putting the heating resistors directly in contact with the PMMA)
06/26/2018
→ test of the new resistor under 12V (a bit less powerful than the yellow one) but it can go to 70°C

→ tested with the actuator and the arduino, seems to work well, we will have to test how to put it in the final prototype
07/25/2018
→ obviously, with the current system, I will not be able to reach 4 degrees so the other solution is to make research on the influence of the cold step on transformations (cf papers from Clement)

Fluorescence module (Charles)
May
05/07/2018
Beginning at 9 am. Organisation of the poles (engineer side). Thought about how to pipette and extract the DNA of interest. Writing a section for “Les trophées de la santé”, it still needs to be completed, especially the financial and repeatability parts.
To do: wrap this file up, working on phage/bacterium interactions (especially if lytic or lysogenic, needs to go through the R algorithm), rejuvenate the Trello.
05/08/2018
“Trophée de la santé” wrapped up. Research on phage/bacterium interaction; from the ultra-specific PA phages list, are they lytic or lysogenic? 1st look at the Random forest algorithm, but I did not understand a lot of things.
Research on fluorescence detection. We work with BFP and RFP (399/456 nm et 584/607 nm). The light source should have a spectrum that covers both excitation wavelengths, to be selected with a filter. A LASER is not a good idea as 2 fluo means 2 laser, which are not that small + a 400 nm LASER is expensive. Here is a schematic representation:
A dichroic mirror should be placed under the plate to let the incident wavelength to go through to not lose fluo. Conversely to what is schemed, the optical fiber cannot be fixed to the dichroic mirror since the excitation light must be reflected on the mirror. Having this mirror under the plate letting the 395 nm light go through allows to measure the OD if necessary, taking the reflexion on the mirror in consideration. The mirror should be at infinity to focus light on the photomultiplier.
This device should work, but I still need to think of the excitation light. We could use a mercury-vapour light but it seems its sell is illegal. I also have to think about its power. The geometry should also be considered, but it is hard to know what to do until I do the experiments. I should also have a closer look in the photomultiplier functioning.
To do: keep working on fluo. Check the crowdfunding file. Write a recored for the Fondation INP.
05/09/2018
Review of the crowdfunding file for Fondation UGA. It is not finished yet, the communication part has to be written by Vincent. I then worked on the fluorescence unit, especially on the dichroic filter and the photomultiplier. My researches were not really productive, as I did not understand the data sheet: I sent an email to the company to get some explanations (about the window material and the transmission). Concerning the dichroic mirror, I need to do some experiments to make sure I correctly understand how it works, as it changes from a scheme to another.
Yesterday I wanted a dichroic mirror under the tank, but it might not be necessary, a curved mirror should be enough, as the optic fiber should be located at the image focal point of the mirror. The “laser” will be reflected as well, but the dichroic mirror should deviate the light. If necessary, a filter could be used as well.
Most importantly, I found how to get a precise wavelength with a white light. It can be done with a monochromator device, it is explained on the bibliography file (I need to go more through this part). It can be really useful as the wavelength can be selected by moving the cristal.
For the automatisation part, a wheel in the (xy) plan seems to be a good idea. It keeps the pipette and the temperature units (Peltier unit and heating resistor) fixed.
To do: keep working on the fluorescent unit. 2nd modelling. Onshape.
05/10/2018
1st approach on Onshape. I modelled a lens, a dichroic filter, a well and the photomultiplier. However, the previous apparatus imagined is not appropriated to the project. First, it is hard to select 2 wavelengths with a dichroic mirror. Moreover, a photomultiplier needs a high voltage alimentation (800 V at least !); it is dangerous enough to work with UV light, I will not risk an electrocution on top of that.
The new system is presented in the figure below:
The sample is alternatively lighted by the blue and red LEDs, so that the fluorescences do not overlap. The filters are coherently placed in front of the camera thanks to servomotors (in position OFF, the filter could be in front of the corresponding LEDs, in this case the scheme is wrong).
The camera takes a picture of the fluorescence, therefore it will probably be measured as last year, with a greyscale.
To do: Onshape of this new prototype, project report.
05/11/2018
5/11: Onshape of the fluorescent module. Mail about epifluorescence to Lionel Bastard.
05/12/2018
Explored the iGEM’s latest development about fluorescence detection. Munich 2017 used a photoresistor. Cheap, to detect light variation, but highly sensitive to the environment, so cannot be applied if we’re to cold the well during the detection.
I however found a light captor sensitive from 0.1 lux and quite stable. I need to determine if it will fit to the fluorescence luminance, so I bought it with an Arduino.
Onshape of a second fluorescence detection module. The LEDs are missing, I failed to draw them, but I expect them to be next to the corresponding filter.
05/14/2018
1st day at the Phelma’s remise!
I found the PERFECT good LEDs and filters ! The LEDs’ spectra are really narrow, so the noisy light should be entirely filtered. However, the filters are to be tested, especially one which cutoff wavelength is at 605 nm, so very near from the maximum wavelength emission (607 nm). According to its characteristic curve everything should be fine but it still needs to be tested.
From this day, the tests that I need to do are:
→ Influence of temperature on fluorescence
→ Influence of pH on fluorescence
→ Fluorescence intensity of BFP/RFP
→ Resolution test of the sensor; to be compared with a photoresistance
→ Tests of the LEDs & filters
05/15/2018
I received my Arduino Uno ! After struggling a lot to plug my several wires, I finally succeeded to:
→ enlight successively 2 LEDs
→ enlight successively 2 series of 2 LEDs
That is the good part of the day.
Concerning the bad part, the RFP biobrick might not be RFP, but a luminescent protein. The measurement must then be done by absorbance, which changes totally the structure of the module, as the light source is to be under the sample, but we do not have enough space. In a nutshell, this biobrick is a bioshit that I hope we won’t use.
05/16/2018
Meeting with Javier Yugueros Marcos (Biomérieux), cf report.
Having some fun with a stepper motor that does not rotate… What I and Thomas noticed is that the stabilised alimentation is limited in current. We expected to provide 2 A but we only have 0.04 A. The Arduino might be the reason but that would mean that alimentation is directly connected to the Arduino, that is to say that the H bridge is invisible in the circuit whereas it is a new one… However, for sure something in the circuit limits in current.  Still working on it tomorrow.
05/24/2018
Alright I am a “little” late on this notebook, so I’ll try to summarize what I’ve done since 5/17.
→ the motor finally worked, a little resistance had to be put off the circuit, as it did limit the current.
→ I wrote my first weekly wiki, I am not sure that everything is useful for the website but whatever
→ The fluorescence unit changed. Quantitative analysis of the fluorescence requires an absorbance measurement to normalise fluorescence, as different concentration of bacteria might give the same fluorescence. So that means that a light detector should be placed under the sample with an excitation filter to get rid of fluorescence and only detect the transmitted light. However, according to Lucas, absorbance is relevant to be measured when light diffusion can be neglected which is not our case, so this is to be thought on.
→ Anyway I found better filters for each case (fluorescence and absorbance) and better LEDs with high power.
→ I wrote a few protocols about fluorescence and the impact of different parameters. I expect to work in the lab next week, probably on tuesday
→ We succeed with Thomas to create a magnetic field from a home-made coil, as we attracted a metallic screw.
05/25/2018
I worked on the magnetic gradient with Thomas. After hours of spooling, we succeeded to attract ferromagnetic dust between 2 coils, but we are not sure that it is due to the gradient, we are not even sure that there is a magnetic gradient. However Thomas took a pretty cool video!
05/28/2018
Received my light sensor. The related library needs to be modified, as it calculates the light intensity with integers, so the resolution is not 0.1 lux but 1 lux. Thomas did some changes, but it is not enough. Working on it tomorrow.
1st biology experiments, Elise coached us on a transformation that I probably failed. We’ll see the results tomorrow.
I was supposed to do my manip on fluorescence, but my culture did not grow well, so I did nothing.
05/29/2018
reviewed my sensor, I managed to display float light intensity, with a 0.01 lux accuracy. This is not coherent with the sensor’s datasheet but it doesn’t matter: it just means that I don’t measure exactly a light intensity, but this is the case for all my measures. So I’ll just need to do some statistics and guess what bacteria population give what value. I reused the 2017’s kit to do some tests: I wanted to know if it could detect a LED light. I finally succeeded: the LED was emitting light in a non-optimal path, at almost 2 cm from the sensor, and I got 0.14lux. I tested later with the LED at 3 cm, and I got 0.04lux. I added fluorescent bacteria, excited by the LED. With a 200µL sample of pure bacteria, no changes could be noticed. With a 1-2 mL sample, I noticed a change of 0.2lux (0.3-0.4 lux to 0.6-0.7lux). It seems hard to detect fluorescence with the sensor, but the experimental conditions were not optimal (I don’t know what quantities of bacteria I had, ambient light noise), so further tests have to be done.
I also did some fluorescence tests (cf protocol) with a solution containing transformed bacteria having expressed a RFP fluorescence.
Although I at first had to review my protocol, forgot to do the controls, struggled with the lector, I finally managed to do the protocols (I won’t perform the pH protocol I think as it is actually written in the database that the proteins are not sensitive to acidity). The data seem at first coherent (fluorescence decreases with dilution, with temperature), I still need to go into the values. This will be done tomorrow.
05/30/2018
I analysed the data from my yesterday’s experiments. The conclusions are avalaible here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aiut2_jhZVGnPqKSf9THaB-Iu_z0pZb4 . To summarise, fluorescence is indeed proportional to the bacteria concentration, and temperature does not influence enough to vary it.
I also began to learn HTML5 with OpenClassrooms. It is pretty easy for the moment, but that is only because I didn’t go into CSS3 yet. The most difficult part of HTML5 is, it seems, to address correctly the pictures/links etc. This is all about organisation, but I think it’ll be fine.  Lionel Bastard came at the end of the day. It surprised him that I did not want a lens in my device, but 1 cm gap between the sensor and the sample eventually convinced him that it might be not necessary. I still follow the same strategy to not use a lens at first and see later if I really need one. Actually this will be largely determined by the solid angle: this is what will tell me if I chose wisely my sensor. He also advised me to use a monopixel sensor, or a photodiode. Another primordial point is to calculate the noise to signal ratio. To do so I’ll have to test my light source on a LB sample (no bacteria in it) and see “how much” light my sensor can detect. To improve this ratio, he advised me to add another emission filter, to improve the noise attenuation.
05/31/2018
I found 1cm x 1cm photodiodes with good sensibility. I still need to test my current sensor to make sure it does not suit. This will be done tomorrow.  I kept on learning HTML5/CSS3.
June
06/13/2018
Let’s summary everything that has been done since last time.
→ I tested the sensor again: it really does not suit at all, it sucks. It cannot sense fluorescence light. Another sensor has to be found: a photodiode. I ordered one with a large sensor surface and a relatively good responsivity (I cannot compare it to the 1st sensor as its graph is normalised but I expect it to be better)
→ A drawback of the photodiode can be its dark current. The 1st idea was to measure beforehand the light power from fluorescence. It seems easy stated like that but it is actually not, as a light power is usually measured in lux instead of watts which corresponds to the responsivity curve of a photodiode.
→ The previous issue should be solved with the conditioning circuit:
This circuit can be divided in 3 parts: a transimpedance circuit, the amplificator stage and the memory stage.
I) transimpedance circuit:
As I did not find any photodiodes in LTSpice, I replaced it with an ideal source current: this is in theory the same thing, the idea is just to get a current which is supposed relatively low (the values for the current do not correspond to the following tests)
The aime of this stage is to convert the very low current into a voltage. The output voltage of this stage is:
As the current is very low, the resistance should be very high. A 400 MΩ resistance is usually expected for that kind of circuit but it is not an easy resistance to find, and I bet it is expensive. For the moment, let’s use a 4.7MΩ resistance: it is not as good as using a 400MΩ resistance as the signal will be more noisy.
II) Memory
The memory stage is the heart of the circuit. Its aim is to hold the voltage related to the dark current so that it can be removed from the experimental current at the amplification stage:
This graph corresponds to an initial current of 600 nA (dark current of the photodiode) which 10 pA is added from the fluorescence (let’s hope it will be greater).
The voltage at the output of the 1st circuit is in blue and the voltage at the output of the memory stage is in green. We want the green voltage to be equal to the blue voltage during the first 60s (it is the dark current voltage). There is a little difference at first of a few µV so I think we can consider they are equal. When the photodiode is illuminated, which comes out with a greater current and then a voltage lower (this is indeed what we can see at 60s).
The voltage is stored thanks to a S/H stage built with a capacity and a follower. After 60s, the switch is off, so the voltage from the fluorescence light is not stored in the capacity. However, as the capacitor is no longer supplied, it eventually unloads. A high capacity reduces the unload time: the previous graph is displayed with a 1µF capacity, but the voltage is pretty damn constant with a 100µF capacity:
It is quite important to take care of this stage: if its output voltage is not constant enough, or too far from VD, the output of the amplification stage will not correspond exactly to the voltage of the fluorescence light.
III) Amplification
This is an amplification stage with a single differential OpAmp. I am not sure yet that we will use this stage exactly or a stage which would look more like the one we used for the BE (with a single resistance to set the gain).
This is what we obtain at the output:
The variation is very little,  but once again, the current related to fluorescence is there equal to 10pA, it would be really disappointing: this would mean that the light’s power is equal to almost 0.2nW (responsivity of 0.2A/W).
With a 601 nA current, the output is nearly equal to 1V.
The entire circuit:
N.B.: a capacity might be placed in parallel of the transimpedance’s resistance.  There is no filter stage yet: that is because I don’t know what to filter, this will be determined in the lab.
The bias current of the transimpendance’s AOP must be very low (fA) → model in Chamilo Very high impedance for the follower
Gain yet to be set as we don’t know the current generated from fluorescence.
In itself, there are a lot of advice in Bucci’s lesson → must-read
→ Data will be eventually be acquired with an Arduino and sent to a raspberry pi that can monitor a touch-sensitive screen (cf bibliography)
06/14/2018
BEGINNING OF THE FIFA WORLD CUP!!!
Besides that, I tested the memory stage with a 100µF capacitor. There is an unload that is actually non neglectable (200mV/min at the beginning), which means a 3mV/s loss. I don’t know yet what current will give me fluorescence but I hope it will be higher than 3 mV, otherwise, I’ll have to find another way to hold the dark currentvoltage (maybe with the raspberry pi, but I haaaaaate this idea, it is so ugly).
July
07/11/2018
Otherwise, to sum up what I’ve done during the last month :
→ The conditioning circuit works on breadboards, the memory stage is pretty convincing as the capacity unloads 1mV/20s. Working on through-hole components, a polymer capacitor is what suits the best to a memory stage as its capacity can be really high (up to 100µF) but unlike chemical capacitors for instance, they have a high leakage resistance. Ideally, this resistance should have the same impedance as the AOP which is harshly the case with polymer capacitors. X7R capacitors have a much higher impedance, but they are smd components. I then need to work on smd. Another reason to work on smd is that my trans-impendance AOP can only be soldered smd.
I tried to work on SMD but the circuit doesn’t work: I can’t solder cleanly, so it’s really hard to have something that is functional. Basically, soldering the components in the wrong way means that they must be unsoldered, which destroys the tracks for instance. Actually, the transimpedance and the memory stage eventually worked, but the PCB was so damaged that it was not possible to fix the substractor stage.
As the circuit worked on breadboard, I tried to solder thru hole components on another PCB. Same issues as last time, it did not work. It is quite concerning as I need to test my photodiode to make sure it will detect fluorescence light.
I eventually tested my photodiode on on breadboard as the circuit DOES work on it, but the tests didn’t go well as the working conditions were not good (no complete dark, photodiode not stabilised, eppendorf not placed correctly...). I have to 3D print the components that will constitute my module.
An absorbance measure is not bound to be necessary. This needs to be confirmed by Fred, the fluo expert of Biomérieux. If it is not necessary, the MC simulation, which is really cool, is not necessary. We’d juste need to calibrate beforehand the photodiode. It should be done this way:
→ We measure the output voltage with 3 solutions: 2 highly concentrated  and a blank, to get a straight line.
→ Then, several measures of the blank are done : an average voltage is calculated
→ the minimum sensitivity is this average voltage added to 3 times the standard deviation.
→ We finally complete the line with other concentrations.
This will be done when I have the circuit and the 3D pieces.
Finally… there is no 2 kinds of fluorescence anymore… The only fluorescence we will measure is from RFP. There is no BFP anymore because:
→ iGEM’s backbones are not adapted to BFP.
→ BFP needs 10h of IPTG induction.
So there is a filter I don’t need, and I don’t need to change the filter, so the servo motor is useless. Actually it makes everything easier, except that the measures need now to be performed in 2 different pits. And it is quite disappointing, but well, this is how life goes.
07/31/2018
I have the 1st version of the unit. I’ve used it to do some experiments, that are summed up below:
→ I wanted to evaluate qualitatively how efficient my filter is. To do so, I compared the measured voltage at the trans-impedance stage with and without filter, and I illuminated quite approximately the eppendorf support with 7 LEDs. 8 LEDS were foreseen, but one hole was not correctly designed, so it couldn’t be used to make the wires go through it. By the way, all the holes are not correctly designed, as I can’t insert the LEDs into them. Therefore the LEDs are out of the hole, nearer to the eppendorf but with an uncertain orientation, and they are stabilized with scotch.
Without filter, the photodiode saturated (4.60V); without filter, the photodiode did not saturate. The filter indeed filters the excitation light.
→ I tried to measure fluorescence in an eppendorf with fluorescent bacteria. I observed that the voltage was a little lower with the eppendorf in place, which made me think that the bacteria were not fluorescent. A week of holidays later, I tried again this experiment, but this time I saw fluorescence at the fluorescence microscope, and the sample was quite concentrated. However, I saw the same phenomenon. I had 2 hypothesis (with the help of Clément): it could be the LEDs that are not bright enough, or the filter that is too selective.
I used the UV plate to excitate a petri dish with fluorescent bacteria: the fluorescence can be seen to the naked eye, so the filter indeed lets the fluorescence light by. However, when trying to detect something with the photodiode, I am very near to the saturation value. Worst, this value is still lower than the one I obtain with a petri dish with LB-agar. I do believe that both LEDs and filter are an issue.
August
08/1/2018
New tests with the same UV plate but with different filter, lent by Clément. While trying them, I remembered an advice given by my optics teacher Lionel Bastard, that reducing the habitable area decreases the noise level. Moreover, I was yet very close to the saturation, so these were 2 reasons to hide a great part of the photodiode with black scotch tape. I reached 3.9V with an assembly of 2 filters, but I noticed I had better performance with my own filter as I reached 2.9V. This measures were performed with fluorescent bacteria. I felt confident and performed several measures on this Petri dish, then with a Petri dish with LB agar, and I calculated the dark current of the photodiode. This day was the 1st time I got coherent results about qualitative fluorescence, as the voltage was higher with fluorescent bacteria:
Actually the control is wrong, and new measures were performed with transformed bacteria that are not fluorescent, which changes the voltage, but I didn’t make the calculus yet.
To confirm the previous result, I wanted to measure fluorescence with another Petri dish which is also highly concentrated in fluorescent bacteria, but still less than the 1st one. Here the results are not good as the voltage is lower than the control voltage. However, I should do this experiment again as I think I went a little too fast through it.
Now it begins to be shitty: the UV transilluminator I used doesn’t work anymore. So I changed it, but it means I need to do my experiments again as the light excitation is brighter. So I began to do again the experiments but now I have no voltage difference. The voltage is higher (3.9V), so I guess the light should not be too bright.  So I did the experiments again, and I don’t know why it failed before, but with the light reduced to 70% of the maximum, I can see a voltage difference again:
So I can see something, but with such concentrated bacteria, I’d hope to have higher voltages. Well, this shows how important the amplification stage is. It seems that I could use a gain of 10. But this will be determined undoubtedly with a liquid detection. This is what I tried to perform next but I struggle to have a decent apparatus to do my experiments: the photodiode is not correctly placed on the eppendorf so it saturates. Well, I’m just thinking of it, but it may be time to use again my 3D impressed unit.
08/19/2018
Let’s sum up again.
Since last time, I made a lot of experiments, with many different conditions. I needed to make sure that my filter was correctly chosen. So I reused the last year apparatus, that I know it had worked well.
The blue filter is my own filter, the red one is last year’s. The 1st graph displays different value of voltage fluorescence depending on the light source and the emission filter. I have very little differences between the voltage in any case excepting with a very bright light source. I could conclude 2 things from this : either the light source is too bright to be filtered with the red filter, which means mine is better, or the light source is so bright that the fluorescence intensity is much higher, but my filter is too selective; so the red filter is the better one. The second graph compares the voltage obtained with each filter with the control and the fluorescent samples. ΔU is defined as ΔU=ΔUred-ΔUblue. This Δ is always positive, I always have a higher voltage with the red filter, which is coherent with the previous results. I also get similar differences between the samples with different filters and light sources conditions, except for the very bright one: the control voltage is much higher. My conclusion on this is that the filters are equivalent for low bright light sources, but mine is better for high light intensity, which I can get with my LEDs when I supply them with the voltage source. Considering also that I know my filter but not last year’s, I decided to keep mine.
Yet, I realised something. I don’t exactly remember how, but I got interested in the way my LEDs excite my samples. Either I remembered my past experiments with my 3D printed apparatus or I went on them again, but I was striked by how the light on the sample is less bright that at the level of the LEDs. I made the terrible mistake to think that the viewing angle was not important. Worse than that, I thought that the optical power is unchanging in the light beam, which is dreadfully wrong. I paid too much attention to the optical power, but the light intensity, which is dependent on the solid angle (and Lionel Bastard, my optics teacher, told me so well how important this solid angle is primordial), which depends on the viewing angle, is a better way to choose the light source. What I should actually have done is to take a LED with the highest light intensity possible and the lowest viewing angle, and determine experimentally the optical power with the photodiode. From that, I had several possibilities. I could simply change of LEDs, but I didn’t want to waste my time. I thought of using lenses to focus the light on the sample. It would have basically looked something like that:
It is a very schematic scheme, but it sums up the idea and the issues this idea brings. The LEDs are in the same plane that the photodiode, the focal object plane of the 1st lens, behind the emission filter. A 2 lenses assembly focus the light on the sample which is in the focal image plane of the second lens. The fluorescence light is reemitted on the photodiode which is on the same plane that the photodiode. This system raises 2 issues. Firstly, the filter would have been to selective, the light intensity on the sample wouldn’t have been high enough. Secondly, the viewing angle of the LEDs demand the numerical aperture. To get the full light beam, I would need a lens with a numerical aperture higher than sin(150°/2)=0.9 and a focal of 1.4 cm, which I did not find.
The last solution before changing of LEDs is to get them closer to the sample. I changed the eppendorf holder for the aluminium plates, in which I installed the LEDs very close to the sample, so that I don’t need to take care of the viewing angle. This arrangement has given me the best results so far, as I could see a sensitive difference between a non-fluorescent sample and a fluorescent one. At this point, I have what seems to be a qualitative fluorescence detector, with a bad sensitivity. The measurements can all be found here under the name “fluo_dilution_quantitative_measurements”
The first experiments were done by hand, which explains the few values in comparison with the last experiments which voltages were measured with the Arduino. The values are significantly different as I faced many issues during the experiments (LEDs short circuit, not perfect dark, auto-inhibit fluorescence phenomenon), which makes difficult to compare them. However, one can learn a few lessons. The control voltage is too high, I have too much noise from the LEDs, which reduces the sensitivity. Also, I have nothing linear, it is much more like a logarithmic function, whereas the voltage is given by:
V=kRDRλP0C with:   k a coefficient to be experimentally determined in L/(mol.cm)
RD the trans-impedance stage resistance in Ω
Rλ the responsivity at λ=610 nm in A/W
P0 the optical power from the LEDs received by the sample in W
C the concentration of bacteria in the sample in mol/L
Besides the 1st experiment, I always have the same order of magnitude (105), and this result is quite near to the one obtained by Munich 2017.
To get back to the LEDs, I need to change them. Their emission spectrum overflow too much on the fluorescence spectrum. With yellowish-green LEDs, I hope to have a lower voltage control, and therefore a better sensitivity.
Something to be mentioned: the voltage measured with the Arduino is varying a lot, but the mean value is quite good (difference of 5mV with the voltmeter on 10000+ values) and the standard deviation is very low.
In case it doesn’t work, I’ll have to change the photodiode for a CMOS sensor, as the fluorescence can be easily seen.
Pipetting module & global structure (Jean)
June
06/18/2018
Today I worked on the pipette module, more precisely on the control of the pipette with the Arduino controller.
First I soldered with Thomas all the buttons (Select, Up, Down…) and made the electronic circuit to control them.
Then I started to write a program to test how to aspire different volumes and different speeds. I realized that the pipette doesn’t really reset so when one restart it, the values of the volume and the speed in/out are still the same as before. That’s a problem because without input from the user, it seems impossible to fix the pipette at a defined volume since we don’t know the value we start from. Moreover, we can’t even try to go at the maximum or minimum value to have a known start point because the pipette does a loop : When it reaches 10μL, if we increase again the next value is 0.20 μL.
06/19/2018
Still working with the control of the pipette.
I tried to test different parameters:
→ How much can we reduce the time for pressing a button? I found that the delay time 175ms for HIGH and LOW levels is a good value. With several tests, I didn’t notice any bug.
→  How can we change the volume faster? If we keep the button up or down pressed then it goes faster. So I made a graph with the delay time we keep pressed on the button and the delta in volume it implies. !!
NOTE: the next value after 10μL is 0.20μL
06/20/2018
The code is now quite well structured with different functions and parameters easy to modify.
Seems like everything is working perfectly.
There is :
→ One function to set the volume with the initial and the wanted volume as parameters It can use another function to determine the time we need to keep the button up or down pressed to change the volume faster.
→ One function to set the speeds in and out.
→ Functions to aspire and dispense the liquid
06/21/2018 → 06/27/2018
I worked with Charles on the conditioning circuit for the photodiode. We managed to make it work on the breadboard circuit but something is still wrong with the PCB.
06/28/2018 → 06/29/2018
I worked with Thomas on the mechanics for the circular movement of the carousel. We made some wedges to reduce the weight on the motor itself hoping that it would have an easier and more linear movement.
July
07/02/2018
Meeting/brainstorming with the engineering team in the morning to take stock of the situation on every modules, what components we need to order, and all the constraints we have.
→ We have to speed up on the “mechanics” and “pipette”  modules to be able to design the pieces we need on CAD.
So I started to work on the Eppendorf 1000uL pipette the LMGP gave us. However, there is a problem we didn’t realise before : the eject tip button is mechanical… additionally we need a really small adaptor for the power supply that we don’t have. So, no test can be done for now, and it seems like we have to buy another pipette like we had before but designed for a bigger volume.
Individual pictures the evening.
07/03/2018
→ Worked on the mechanics with Thomas. Found a better coupling system for the motor.
→ Soldered connectors on the PCB plate for the fluorescence. Still doesn’t work.
07/04/2018
→ New tests on the rotative plate, results are OK. The steps are regular and precise enough.
→ Found connectors for the pipette Eppendorf. It’s working properly with a sufficient power supply
07/05/2018 → 07/06//2018
CAD to design a new pipette clamp for the Eppendorf Pipette in case we use it.
07/11/2018
The pipette clamp has been printed, there is a problem of dimension but with bolts the fixation is OK.
I sent mails to fablabs in the Grenoble region to find one we’ll be able to access while the buildings of Phelma will be closed. The INRIA fablab answered positively !
07/12/2018
I drilled holes in the middle of the rotative wooden plates to make the cables and wires pass inside.
I also began to look the water cooling system to cool the back side of the Peltier modules.
We’ll try to change the pipes to others less rigid so they can pass inside the hole too.
I looked for connectors in T on internet to allow the filling of cooling liquid in the pump.
Bought connectors, pipes, and stuff to test the water cooling with less rigidity.
Testing that we realized that it would be complicated to use it because the pipes would still apply too much stress on the plates.
Then we looked for thinner fans like laptops ones.
07/19/2018
→ Moving from Phelma to Jean Roger buildings.
07/20/2018
I started to look some connectors and assembled cables to make a “cleaner” and more robust prototype
August
08/06/2018
→ Looked for another pipette biohit e300 to buy on ebay. Bought one in the US that Thomas brother will bring back.
→ Contacted the fablab of INRIA to use the laser cutting machine to make the plexiglas plates. → Looked for connectors and assembled cables.
08/07/2018
→ Looked again for connectors and assembled cables.
→ Communication raspberry Pi / Arduino to use a touchscreen.
08/08/2018
→ Went to INRIA Fablab to make the plexiglas plates with the laser cutting machine.
→ Made wooden wedges.
→ Bought screws, stuffs, and fans for Jean Roger buildings :)
08/09/2018
Started to construct the new prototype with aluminium bars and plexiglas plates. We are missing some pieces to fix the brackets on the aluminium bars.
08/10/2018
→ Looked for linear guide for the pipette like the one Julien Traveaux lent to us.
→ Tested the warming resistance on a plexiglas plate. Good result, it doesn’t deform itself !
08/13/2018
→ I designed the plate to support the pipette on Onshape.
→ I tested the optocoupler, it worked. To use it with the pipette, we just have to change a bit the code : in the setup, let the state at HIGH, and for the function triggerbutton we have to invert HIGH and LOW also. Otherwise the button is triggered non-stop.
08/14/2018
Went to INRIA to make plexiglas and wooden plates and wedges. Bought stuff at castorama
08/15/2018
Built the system with the new plates,
08/16/2018
I designed a piece on Onshape to fix the actuator with the magnet holder on the central plate.
08/20/2018
I built the linear guide with the pieces received today and fixed the pipette on it.
08/22/2018
Soldered the pipette received from the US. Unfortunately, it is not working. We will have to use the pipette Biohit e10 event if it is not the ideal volume.
08/28/2018
Since we decided to realize a transformation in the machine, I am trying to execute some complex actions like taking a pipette tip. Unfortunately it is not working because the pipette can still move a bit in the pipette holder.
08/29/2018
Charles wrote a first pseudo-code to make a transformation and I tried to use it in the system. I referenced some angles to move the rotative plate so that samples are placed right below the pipette.
08/31/2018
Moving from Jean Roger buildings to Phelma !
09/06/2018
Drilled a hole on the handle of the pipette to fix it better to the pipette holder so that we can take pipette tips better.
