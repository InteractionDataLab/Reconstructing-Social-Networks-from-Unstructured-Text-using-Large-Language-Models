The lab provided all necessary materials beyond what iGEM supplied. Dr. Daniel and his Master's student, Keren Espinoza provided us with training and lab space to conduct our experiment. 
</P><H3>Dr. Daniel Guerra and Ms. Keren Espinosa</H3><P>Dr. Daniel and Keren provided us with training on synthetic biology concepts and lab skills. They helped us troubleshoot our project, discussing with us each day we were in the lab. Additionally, Keren would sometimes help fill in the gaps when we were rushed for time for example by making gels ahead of time for us or rerunning a gel that wasn't clear. She also helped us with the initial growth of bacteria cultures so they were competent when we arrived on site.</P><H3>Mentors</H3><P>Dr. Nina Markham organized the iGEM team and recruited the help of Dr. Daniel's lab at Cayetano. She has accompanied us to the majority of our Cayetano visits and helped push us to learn the concepts and work on the different aspects of the iGEM project, including our Wiki and presentation and poster.
Mr. Bob Oddo was with us at the beginning of the iGEM season and accompanied us to T.A.S.A. Cayetano and helped in focusing our project.
</P><H3>Additional Lab Support</H3><P>Overlapping PCR - Rodrigo Alarcon advised Keren on the PCR protocol

Nanodrop - Dr. Patty Sheen lab at Cayetano University allowed us to measure DNA concentrations

Spectrophotometer - Dr. Luis Aguilar lab at Cayetano University allowed us to use the spectrophotometer to produce our bacterial growth curves.

Fish Meal: T.A.S.A.provided us with all the fish meal samples

        </P><H3>Hardware</H3><P>Container Design - Pierre Padilla at Cayetano University advised our hardware team and allowed them use his lab space to conduct some of the experiments.

Infographics - Dr. Maju Brunette

Wiki - Mrs. Sherrie Buchner

3-D Printing - Mr. Dale Poloski

Habla Roosevelt - Joe Bonnici FDR mentor for coordinating Saturday time for the Habla students to learn science from our team

Girls Can - 4th  grade teacher, Skye Aalveson, at FDR for coordinating time with girls from her class to learn science from our team

Mrs. Diane Holloway and Mrs. Wendy Dierkes graciously assisted.
</P><H3>Transportation</H3><P>Mr. Chris Mott, our athletics director, and his assistant, Rosana Coronal, arranged for transportation for us to and from Cayetano as well as our travel and accomodations in Boston. This is actually very involved, given the conditions in Lima, Peru.</P><H3>Nanodrop</H3><P>Dr. Patty Sheen lab at Cayetano University</P>
