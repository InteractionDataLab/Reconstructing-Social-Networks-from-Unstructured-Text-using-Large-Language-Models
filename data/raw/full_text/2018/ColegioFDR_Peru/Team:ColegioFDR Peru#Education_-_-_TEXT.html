Lesson Plans
Egg Drop Lesson
The egg drop lesson is the classic activity that aims to give kids an introduction to physics through the design of the model that will minimize the impact of the egg when it reaches the ground.  Before beginning the activity, we explained how they could use air resistance to slow the egg down and how they could use a structure to minimize the impact.
Explosion - Implosion Lesson
The explosion - Implosion lesson is a good introduction to physics that is fun and engaging for kids. We decided to demonstrate the coke and mentos experiment and explain the reaction that takes place when the mentos are dropped into the coke. Then  we showed the kids how an egg is sucked into a bottle when placed over a smoking match or paper  which demonstrates the relationship between temperature and pressure.
Paper Aeroplane Lesson
The paper airplane lesson was another introduction the physics concepts. We showed the kids a video that explained the physics behind a paper airplane and then challenged them to see who could create the paper airplane that traveled furthest and stayed airborne the longest. We also gave them paper clips so they could find out how weighting different parts of the plane would affect how it flies.
Straw Bridge Lesson
The straw bridge is an activity that consists of creating a structure out of straws , held together by tape that will support the weight of a small textbook. The group of kids will be divided into teams of 2 or 3 and asked to complete their structure given 20 minutes. The tallest and most stable structure will win. This activity aims to teach the kids about the importance of base area in 3D structures.
Zip-Line Lesson
Girls Can!
Girls Can! is a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) service project looking to bridge the gender gap in education through the arts. It saw a need arise in our community as integrated learning can often leave girls feeling underrepresented and unempowered to pursue STEM later on.  The ColegioFDR_Peru iGEM teamâ€™s aim was to integrate a social issues component to their program and apply science to the real world. This season, we have worked with a group of 4th grade girls to explain basic geology and oceanography concepts, tying into global issues such as mercury pollution and the rising sea levels. The ColegioFDR_Peru iGEM team believes providing a basic environmental education is necessary for future generations to understand the role of synthetic biology. We had previously collaborated with Girls Can! in the 2017 season and will continue in the 2019 season.
