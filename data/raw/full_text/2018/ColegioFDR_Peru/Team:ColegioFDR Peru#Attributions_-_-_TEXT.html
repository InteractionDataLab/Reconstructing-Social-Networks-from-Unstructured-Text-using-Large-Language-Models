Lab Work conducted at Cayetano University
All lab work was completed in the laboratory of Dr. Daniel Guerra at Cayetano University in Lima, Peru. The lab provided all necessary materials beyond what iGEM supplied. Dr. Daniel and his Master's student, Keren Espinoza provided us with training and lab space to conduct our experiment.
Dr. Daniel Guerra and Ms. Keren Espinosa
Dr. Daniel and Keren provided us with training on synthetic biology concepts and lab skills. They helped us troubleshoot our project, discussing with us each day we were in the lab. Additionally, Keren would sometimes help fill in the gaps when we were rushed for time for example by making gels ahead of time for us or rerunning a gel that wasn't clear. She also helped us with the initial growth of bacteria cultures so they were competent when we arrived on site.
Mentors
Dr. Nina Markham organized the iGEM team and recruited the help of Dr. Daniel's lab at Cayetano. She has accompanied us to the majority of our Cayetano visits and helped push us to learn the concepts and work on the different aspects of the iGEM project, including our Wiki and presentation and poster. Mr. Bob Oddo was with us at the beginning of the iGEM season and accompanied us to T.A.S.A. Cayetano and helped in focusing our project.
Additional Lab Support
Overlapping PCR - Rodrigo Alarcon advised Keren on the PCR protocol  Nanodrop - Dr. Patty Sheen lab at Cayetano University allowed us to measure DNA concentrations  Spectrophotometer - Dr. Luis Aguilar lab at Cayetano University allowed us to use the spectrophotometer to produce our bacterial growth curves.  Fish Meal: T.A.S.A.provided us with all the fish meal samples
Hardware
Container Design - Pierre Padilla at Cayetano University advised our hardware team and allowed them use his lab space to conduct some of the experiments.

Additional Chaperone help to visit Cayetano
Because we traveled at least 1 hour each way (sometimes, depending on traffic, it could be 2 hours) to Cayetano, we needed additional chaperones to go with us when Dr. Markham couldn't make it. Mrs. Diane Holloway and Mrs. Wendy Dierkes graciously assisted.
Transportation
Mr. Chris Mott, our athletics director, and his assistant, Rosana Coronal, arranged for transportation for us to and from Cayetano as well as our travel and accomodations in Boston. This is actually very involved, given the conditions in Lima, Peru.
