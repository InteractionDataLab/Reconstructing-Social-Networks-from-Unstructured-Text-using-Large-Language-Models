Evidence for Bacteria Transformed with Killer Red Construct
The gel contains the restriction products of the plasmid using the HindIII (Well 5) and BamHI (Well 6) enzymes. Both restrictions have the same size, showing that both restrictions were successful and that the two plasmids are the same. It is also evidence that the HindIII restriction site we added into our construct is present, and it was cut by the enzyme, further suggesting that the construct was ligated to the plasmid backbone.
Once we incubated three tubes of bacteria for 60 minutes under normal conditions (37 degrees celsius), we added 0 ppm Mercury (Hg), 25 ppm Hg, and 50 ppm Hg to each tube respectively. This chart is representing the time of absorption of mercury for different amounts of mercury. The bacteria in this chart has been transformed with Killer Red. As time goes on, each of the samples gets absorbed, with the 0ppm sample taking the shortest amount of time and 50 ppm taking the least amount of time.
Once we incubated three tubes of bacteria for 60 minutes under normal conditions (37 degrees celsius), we added 0 ppm Mercury (Hg), 25 ppm Hg, 50 ppm Hg, and 100 ppm Hg to each tube respectively. This chart is representing the time of absorption of mercury for different amounts of mercury. The bacteria in this chart has been transformed with the accumulator. As time goes on, each of the samples gets absorbed, with the 0ppm sample taking the shortest amount of time and 100ppm taking the least amount of time.
