The Journal of FDR Science is the official science publication of our school, Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Each year, faculty-nominated students compose several articles and editorials about topics of interest in the world of science. As part of our Human Practices endeavors, we have published an edition on the Journal of FDR Science, with topics ranging from paper reviews, to lab safety, to ethics––more specifically the ethics of mercury and ocean pollution, as those are in line with our project this year. The variety in articles is important, as our team is comprised of people who are not only interested in the scientific questions iGEM raises, but also in the larger moral and ethical concepts that need to be explored as we indulge in new discoveries.
