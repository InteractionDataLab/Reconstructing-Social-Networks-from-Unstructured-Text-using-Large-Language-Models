Our Human Practices team is focusing on making two infographics with the purpose of facilitating entry into iGEM for colleges and high schools in Perú. One of our infographics is dedicated very specifically to Universidad Agraria (National Agrarian University), Perú’s leading university in the fields of forestry, agricultural, and biological sciences; we believe Universidad Agraria can have a huge impact on the iGEM community, as they are a very high-profile university in Perú. The second infographic is aimed at high schools across Lima, just like us, who would benefit greatly from such a community as the one iGEM nurtures. The world of synthetic biology is an unknown one in Perú, and through iGEM––through these brochures––we can help spread this culture through the capital city of Lima.
