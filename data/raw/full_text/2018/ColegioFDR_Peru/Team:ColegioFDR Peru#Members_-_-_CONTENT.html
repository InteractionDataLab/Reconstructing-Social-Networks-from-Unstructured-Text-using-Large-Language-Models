Since I joined iGEM in December 2017 I have been able to feed my curiosity by exploring this field in depth. I am planning on studying a science liberal arts program for university where I will continue to further understand the world around me. </P></DIV><DIV><H2>Nicolas Gonzalez</H2><P>I find iGEM to be a very inclusive activity, regardless of how complex or high-level the content may be. I enjoy learning advanced procedures and theory for synthetic biology that we would never have a chance to do in grade school, or even in the IB diploma program. I joined iGEM in December 2016 and am now Vice Team-Leader here at team ColegioFDR_Peru. I am graduating as part of the Class of 2019, meaning this is my final high school level iGEM, and I’m determined to make it count! </P></DIV><DIV><H2>Daniela Gioia</H2><P>I have always loved science class, and explanations as to why the world works the way it does have always fascinated me. I decided to join iGEM in order to expand my knowledge In microbiology, and I firmly believe that it has been one of the best decisions I have made in my life. I’ve made so many friends and I’ve learned so much more than I expected to about science. I am so incredibly happy with my team! </P></DIV><DIV><H2>Gabriel de Romaña</H2><P>Throughout my life, it has always been hard to find a place where I truly feel welcome. Well, science people are not common in a world full of sports, TV shows, and more distractions. However, I believe that having joined the ColegioFDR_Peru team in September 2017 has allowed me to pursue my passion for learning and get to know amazing people with similar interests. I am extremely grateful because I couldn't ask for a better team! </P></DIV><DIV><H2>Karina Vestergaard</H2><P>I’ve been living in Peru for six years now and I joined iGEM in December 2016. iGEM has been a way for me to explore different areas of science, but I am particularly interested in veterinary medicine due to my passion for horses. </P></DIV><DIV><H2>Kia Cuba</H2><P>I joined the ColegioFDR_Peru team in September 2017. I knew I always wanted to be part of this club because I have a big interest in science, especially biotechnology and how it solves everyday problems. </P></DIV><DIV><H2>Marco Varriale</H2><P>I am an American who has been living in Peru for the past 10 years. I joined iGEM December 2016 and have enjoyed it ever since. I always knew that I had an interest for biology and genetics. But, I only really began to be truly passionate once I joined GEM and found out how interesting and intricate Genetics could really be. I would like to do Biochemistry at some point in the near future. </P></DIV><DIV><H2>Marry Xuan</H2><P>I am a Chinese girl who has been living abroad for all my life. I have always wanted to pursue the medical field, so iGEM was a perfect way to test the waters. I’ve been on the team for 2 years now and I have found an interest in poking and prodding plasmids to solve difficult problems! </P></DIV><DIV><H2>Regina Kim</H2><P>I am a South Korean who has been living in Peru for two years. I joined the ColegioFDR_Peru team in September 2017. iGEM gave me a lot of opportunities to experience diverse parts of biological engineering which made me more engaged in science. Not only science but also math has always been my passion. I also like helping and teaching others which made me be a part of human practice team of iGEM. </P></DIV><DIV><H2>Virna Seminario</H2><P>I took a real interest in synthetic biology in October of 2017, after being exposed to it in my IB Biology class and I became naturally inclined to join the ColegioFDR_Peru team in 2018. Prior to joining the team, my focus had always been more environmental (attending three UNFCCC Conferences of the Parties). </P></DIV><DIV><H2>Skyler Markham</H2><P>I’ve always enjoyed science and trying to figure things out, understanding how the things around me worked. I’ve wanted to be an engineer most of my life but science, in particular biology, has always been something I consider extremely interesting, this is my first time on the iGEM team and I have thoroughly enjoyed learning about extracting, mutating, and inserting plasmids into bacteria. </P></DIV><DIV><H2>Emilio Gutierrez </H2><P>I joined the ColegioFDR_Peru iGEM team in March 2018 out of curiosity and as a way to expand my scientific participation. At first not very interested in biology, iGEM helped me develop not only a newfound appreciation for biology, but also a deep curiosity for other sciences. I have learned much from the iGEM team this year, and love having the opportunity to work alongside peers dedicated to science. </P></DIV><DIV><H2>Henry Dierkes</H2><P>Joining the iGEM team of ColegioFDR_Peru in March 2018 was my first real science group project since I came to Peru in June 2015. I’ve always been interested in the science that involves chemistry and the project we’re doing is piquing my interests. I’ve never had much knowledge in this type of science before but this is a good place to start. </P></DIV><DIV><H2>Isabel Windsor</H2><P>I joined iGEM in September 2017 and since then I have loved being part of the team and participating in the team project. The reason I enjoy iGEM is that it allows you to combine different talents or passions you may have and apply them to synthetic biology. </P></DIV><DIV><H2>Sofia Villafuerte</H2><P>Before starting high school two years ago, science class was never my favorite and was quite boring to me. After taking biology last year my interest for science grew and I started finding myself watching videos about different topics in biology, chemistry and even astronomy. I decided to join iGEM and I certainly don’t regret it because it has allowed me to expand my knowledge of synthetic biology, something I couldn’t have done during class hours. </P></DIV><DIV><H2>Dr. Markham</H2><P>I joined the ColegioFDR_Peru when I moved to Peru last year just before the 2017 Giant Jamboree so this is my first full &quot;season&quot; with the team. Besides geeking out over Science I love to read, write, hike, bike, and scuba dive. </P></DIV><DIV><H2>Alessandra Vidal</H2><P>I joined the ColegioFDR_Peru team in December 2016 as director of human practices and returned to the 2018 season as team captain. Being raised abroad, I became fascinated with issues of global significance and conflicts. I love literature, podcasts, and the environment. </P><H2>Ms. Holloway</H2><P>I was born in Ohio, USA and went to college in Alabama for my undergraduate degree in Geology with a Composite Science minor. I had been working in the oil and gas industry for several years then I attended the University of Houston in Texas for my teaching certification. I taught middle school and high school science in Texas and in Pennsylvania. I began international teaching almost 20 years ago and have taught various grades and courses in the following countries, Pakistan, Japan, China, Bulgaria and now in Peru. </P><H2>Keren Espinoza</H2><P>I studied Genetics and a master of biochemistry and molecular biology. Now, I work as researcher in the Single molecule laboratory from Cayetano Heredia University. I really like my job, it is really funny to make new experiments and teaching science to young people. </P><H2>Daniel Guerra</H2><P>As director of the Laboratory of Single-Molecule Biophysics of the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, my research projects are about prokaryotic gene expression and DNA-protein interactions involved in its regulation. I'm also very interested in finding new and better ways to teach science, and making more people participate is definitely the way to go. To participate in iGEM is a great opportunity to link my laboratory to potential applications and also to have fun while encouraging young people! </P></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
