General Safety
While working in the lab, lab coats and gloves were always used. The working surface is cleaned with 70% ethanol before and after lab work. All pipette tips, test tubes, and cultures are cleaned afterward using bleach.
Hazardous Chemicals
To test our construct, we grew our bacteria in a solution of medium and diluted Mercury Bromide (HgBr2). HgBr2 is tagged Hazard Level 3 so we had to take extra precautions when using the chemical in the lab. While performing the experiments, we worked under a hood in a sterilized environment while wearing lab coats and gloves. The disposable equipment was sealed in a bag for chemical disposal.
