Girls Can!
Habla Roosevelt is one of the most recognized community-serving clubs at FDR. Each Saturday, from 9am-12pm, students come to campus and teach the worker’s children English. As part of our Human Practices, we have decided to collaborate with Habla and teach seven science lessons for the kids, in which they’ll learn interesting concepts while taking part in fun experiments and learning English along the way. Each lesson is 90 minutes-long and covers a different field, such as velocity and friction, chemical reactions, light, and more. The impact of these activities we hope will be profound, as we have pioneered the science branch of Habla Roosevelt and helped reinforce the kids’ level of English, which, in Perú, just as anywhere else, serves to open up many opportunities in life; hopefully we get to change some lives.
