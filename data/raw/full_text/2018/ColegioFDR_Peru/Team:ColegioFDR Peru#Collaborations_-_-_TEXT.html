UChile Biotec
As part of our Human Practices, we collaborated with the UChile Biotec team. Last year they published a magazine called “iGEM Latinoamérica” to recognize all the work being done by teams all over Latin America. In this magazine, they mostly included descriptions of the different projects, of their Human Practices, and the difficulties they had been experiencing along the way. This year they decided to launch a second edition of the magazine and in the process of doing so, we contributed information about our project, difficulties, and even information about Peru, as a country involved in tourism. Because of their experience with creating magazines, we asked them to help us with our own magazine: the “Journal of FDR Science.” In this issue of the “Journal of FDR Science,” we decided to spotlight our iGEM project this year; in order, to promote the work we’ve done to the rest of our community. Our journal includes our abstract; articles about the health effects resulting from mercury contamination coming largely from metal mines in Peru; and lab safety. Throughout this last month, we have been in frequent contact with UChile Biotec asking for their feedback on each and every one of our drafts. Most of their feedback helped us review the content in our articles, the layout of the journal, and added crucial information about iGEM.
