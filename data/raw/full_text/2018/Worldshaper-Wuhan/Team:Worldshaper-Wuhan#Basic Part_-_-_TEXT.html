IL7-AS [located anti-sense to interleukin-7 (Il7) gene; Accession number: NM_000880.3] is a newly discovered lncRNA that can be induced across multiple human and mouse cell types and has been reported to regulate the expression of interleukin-6 (IL6). IL6 is emerging as a major regulator of renal cell cancer. However, roles of IL7-AS in renal cell cancer and the related molecular mechanisms remain largely undetermined.We cloned the truncated sequences of IL7-AS (IL7-AS-S2 contain 411bp) into pSB1C3 for submitting. And we also cloned IL7-AS-S2 into PCDNA3.1 and transfected these plasmids into 786-O cells. Through in vitro scratch wound healing assay, overexpression of IL7-AS-S2 promoted cell migration of 786-O cells. These results suggested that IL7-AS-S2 contain key structural domains.

Construction Of The Plasmids
We constructed three plasmids PSB1C3-IL7-AS-S2; PSB1C3-IL7-AS-S1 and PSB1C3-IL7-AS. And these three plasmids were submitted to 2018IGEM.
Amplification of IL7-AS-S2; IL7-AS-S1 and IL7-AS fragments. First we amplified IL7-AS-S2; IL7-AS-S1 and IL7-AS fragment using primers. After that, we purified the PCR products by PCR Purification Kit and digested them with restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI (Fig 1 A and B).
(Fig 1. Electrophoresis of IL7-AS-S2 (A: lanes 1); IL7-AS (A: lanes 2) and IL7-AS-S1 (B: lanes3) PCR product.)
Digested PSB1C3 vector. We digested the PSB1C3 vectors with restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI (Fig 2).
(Fig 2. Electrophoresis of the digested PSB1C3 vector.)
Ligation of purified IL7-AS-S2; IL7-AS-S1 and IL7-AS fragments to PSB1C3 vector. IL7-AS-S2(A); IL7-AS-S1(B) and IL7-AS(C) fragments were ligated to PSB1C3 vector, respectively. Then we selected the positive clones by PCR and sequencing (Fig 3).
