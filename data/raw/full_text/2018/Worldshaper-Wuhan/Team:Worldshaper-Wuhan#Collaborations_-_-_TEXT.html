Our Collaborations
As the first stop, we went to Huazhong Agricultural University. We first discussed and exchanged our research topics. Although both of our topics are cancer related, we focused on finding a new biomarker while the HZAU team researched about induction of pyroptosis of tumor cells by carrying gasdermin D in Salmonella into the tumor cells. Due to our lack of experience at attending the final jamboree, we also learned a lot of techinques of making slide shows and presentation skills. We then explored team HZAU's laboratory. As the HZAU team leader kindly invited us for a lunch together, she proposed the possibility for us to try out multiple cell lines from different cancers to test out the specificity of our lncRNA.
The HUST team was the second team we visited. After exchanging our research topics. The HUST team members gave us idea of how to thoroughly write out the background and process of out experiment.
WHU team was the last team we visited. From the team's co-leader, we learned how does a university's team decides on a topic to research on and apply for reimbursement from the school. After discussing about team WHU's topic and its collaboration with team HUST, the co-leader surprisingly provided us an opportunity for a local community propaganda.
The WHU team and our team finally locked in on our presentation topics, which were synthetic biology and renal cell cancer information and prevention. On July 31, members from both teams arrived at Tienan Community in Wuhan in the morning. After doing some community services we presented in front of generally mid aged residents. The event was a success at the end.
