Safety
WorldShaper-Wuhan members are dedicated to follow strict guidelines and regulations on safety. This principle is carried out by our team member as well as our advisors and instructors. We, as a team, understood the potential consequences of poor safety regulations and therefore aim to operate under a thorough and comprehensive guideline.
Lab Rule
1-Every member, when operating in Lab, must wear gloves and wear them in the right way to avoid cross contamination.
2-Proper experimenting attire such as gaggles, close toed shoes, long pants and aprons are required.
3-Electric equipment should be turned off when not using to avoid fire hazard.
4-No food nor drink in allowed in the laboratory.
5-No horseplay.
6-Phones and laptops should be stored in a safe location to prevent contamination when dealing with bacteria.
7-Waste should be properly handled and materials safely stored in the corresponding conditions.
8-All of our team member has been trained in related lab procedure and lab safety to minimize the chance of accident and ensure the safety of the lab. The content of the training includes but not limited to molecular biology, lab procedure, lab techniques, operation of equipment, Lab regulation, personal safety and common solution to possible emergency situations. It is with these steps that we try to ensure the safety of our member and other around us.[1]
Safety Precautions
-All the experiments were performed under the supervision of instructors.
-The most commonly used dye electrophoresis is Ethidium Bromide, which is also known to be highly toxic as a mutagen[2]. Even though its potential effect on causing cancer has yet been attested [2], the dye is still replaced by GoldView, which is non-carcinogenic [3] and as sensitive [4]as EB.
The Chassis
We use DH5 alpha E. coli. as our chassis. It is a Escherichia coli k-12, a strain of E within risk group 1[5]. Hence, the risk involved by the chassis is at the lost level if all the lab rules are followed.
Ethics
blahblahblah
Laws
The laws on genetic modification in China can be divided into two categories. The first category [6] is on genetic modified organisms applies to:
i)plant seeds, farm animals, aquacultural organisms, and microorganisms;
ii)Products made from genetically modified organisms;
iii)Processed genetically modified agricultural products;
iv)Products containing ingredients from genetically modified plants, animals and microorganisms as well as seeds, live stocks, aquacultural fingerlings, pesticides and herbicides, veterinary medicine, fertilizer, and additives etc.
