WeChat igemWorldshaperWH
We created our own WeChat account igemWorldShaperWH (figure 1). WeChat is the most popular social software in China, like Twitter in USA. We used it to make sure we maximize our impact to society. Our daily tweets come from our daily experiments and our human practices.

Questionnaire
In order to better promote our future research. We prepared two questionnaires to investigate the public's understanding of kidney cancer and synthetic biology in the project we investigated. The first questionnaire set 9 questions, including 2 control parameters (age, gender) and 7 closed questions included 132 respondents. Considering the inadequate control parameters of the first questionnaire, our team member prepared the second questionnaire. The questionnaire set 10 questions, including 4 control parameters (age, gender, education level and occupation) and 6 closed questions. We chose to add two control parameters, combined some questions in the first questionnaire, and set up two multiple-choice questions. The second questionnaire consisted of 271 respondents.
Visit Optics Valley at Wuhan
Before we started designing the experiment of our project, we visited several companies in Bio-Valley, including cancer diagnostics and testing companies, and pharmaceutical companies.
We as a team visited the biolake of the Optic Valley, which is the Wuhan bioindustry base and home of leading Chinese biopharmaceutical companies like Humanwell Healthcare, Healthgen Biotechnology, and Zoncare. Kindstar Global, a company located in biolake and focuses its business on medical examination, is the main stopping spot for our trip.
Kindstar Globalgene (Beijing) Technology, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “Kindstar Global”) is the first and biggest leading-edge medical esoteric testing service group in China. This company provide a series of clinical tests, including tumor disease tests, genetic diseases teasts, hematologic dematologic disease tests
Interview
In order to identify our research direction and feasibility, we planned to seek professional advice in local authoritative hospital. Fortunately, we got Dr.Guo’s contact information with advisor’s assistance. Afterward, we made an appointment with Dr.Guo and prepared for our interview draft and some equipment for interviewing.
