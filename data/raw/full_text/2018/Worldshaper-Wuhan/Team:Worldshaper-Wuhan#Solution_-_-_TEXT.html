Our Solution
According HP surveys, it would be very encouraging to find that if our project results can play a role in the early diagnosis of renal cell cancer. Under the guidance of our instructors, for experimental design, we plan design several parts based on long non-coding RNA.
Our team is committed to design a new model based on new biomarkers that can diagnose renal cell cancer with specificity, accuracy and ease, which also has the potential to be used in cancer treatment in the future.
