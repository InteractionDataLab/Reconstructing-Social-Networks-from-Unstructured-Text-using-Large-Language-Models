<P style="font-size:5.5mm; font-family: 'title', sans-serif;" align="LEFT">An introductory course in Synthetic Biology in the form of a 5 part lecture series in 8 Indian languages and several international languages in the hope of communicating synthetic biology in a easy to understand language. <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:IIT-Madras/TheLanguageProject">Read more..</A></P></LI><LI>Visits to school:
<P style="font-size:5.5mm; font-family: 'title', sans-serif;" align="LEFT">With the motivation of inspiring young minds of our country to pursue careers in Biotechnology, we conducted over 4 sessions in various schools that included explaining basic concepts of synthetic biology through fun games and interactive sessions. <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:IIT-Madras/SchoolVisits">Read more..</A></P></LI><LI>Biotech Research Club sessions in Javascript:
<P style="font-size:5.5mm; font-family: 'title', sans-serif;" align="LEFT">In the public engagement and education efforts for our project in 2017, we managed to initiate a dedicated club for inculcating an interest in Biotechnology among the freshmen of our university. As we continued our efforts, we held a introductory session in JavaScript which is a useful tool to make webpages. We ended this session with a fun activity of remaking the “Thanos spares you” webpage.
</P></LI><LI>Two day workshop to spread the knowledge of different spheres of biotechnology and iGEM:
<P style="font-size:5.5mm; font-family: 'title', sans-serif;" align="LEFT">Being aspiring biotechnologists, we decided to educate our fellow undergraduates in various sub fields of Biotechnology from other universities in Tamil Nadu with the help of professors that have expertise in these various fields. We conducted a 2 day educational workshop and lecture series for students across universities. <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:IIT-Madras/Workshops">Read more..</A></P></LI><LI>SynBio journal club:

<P style="font-size:5.5mm; font-family: 'title', sans-serif;" align="LEFT">India is a land of many different languages and rich diversity. Often scientific decisions pertaining to GMO and other important topics do not reach those that speak languages apart from English. Motivated by our efforts of the Language project, we began talking about Synthetic biology to various people and showing them our videos in their native languages. <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:IIT-Madras/TheLanguageProject">Read more..</A></P></LI><LI>Writing about the importance of iGEM and science communication in Synthetic Biology in media:
<P style="font-size:5.5mm; font-family: 'title', sans-serif;" align="LEFT">Our efforts in the language project and subsequent publicity through social media caught the attention of media houses and journals like the Indian chapter of IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers), Times of India and India Bioscience.

<P style="font-size:5.5mm; font-family: 'title', sans-serif;" align="LEFT">We started a series where we educated our viewers on social media like instagram and twitter about significant scientific discoveries that happened in the last century.
</P></LI><LI>IIT Madras Alumni Association Sangam:
<P style="font-size:5.5mm; font-family: 'title', sans-serif;" align="LEFT">We got the opportunity to network with the alumni and share our project and initiatives with them, almost 1000 Alumni visited the event and we received tremendous feedback. Through these interactions, we realized that a huge number of people have misconceptions about genetic modifications and that we should work harder at spreading information about topics which involves a lot of public attention yet has been conveyed in a partial light. We interacted with H.R. Mohan, a senior member of IEEE . He was impressed by our projects and invited us to write about iGEM and science communication in the coming IEEE newsletter.
