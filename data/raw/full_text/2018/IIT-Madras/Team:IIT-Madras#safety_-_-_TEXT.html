Safety
Experiment Design:
The chassis used were Acinetobacter Baylyi ADP1 and Ecoli DH5a which fall under the category of biosafety level 1 organisms. They are non-pathogenic bacteria which were genetically engineered in our project. These were handled with appropriate caution and care while following standard microbiological practices.
Laboratory Work Ethic and Design:
The team underwent training for a period of two weeks to learn the appropriate safety measures and techniques needed to use the necessary laboratory equipment. All laboratory work was done wearing protective coats and gloves. The gloves were changed when they were contaminated and our hands were washed both after completion of work with hazardous material and before leaving the laboratory.
All laboratory waste was decontaminated in an autoclave prior to disposal. A safety shower and fire hydrants are located near the exit of the lab in case of emergencies.
