Language Project Collaborations
The collaboration involves sending the English script to the collaborator, who translate it into another language record the translated script and send us the audio file(s). We stitch together the audio clips and the presentation slides to make the video.
We have had 13 different iGEM teams collaborate with us, resulting in language project videos in 17 different languages for a total of 25 videos. Through these collaborations, we were able to interact and share with all these teams, and it formed a big part of our iGEM experience to talk with such a diverse group of people working for the same goal.
