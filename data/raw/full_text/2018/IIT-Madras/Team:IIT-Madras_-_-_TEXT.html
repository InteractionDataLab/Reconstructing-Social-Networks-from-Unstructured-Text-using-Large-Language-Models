We are proud to present three projects for iGEM 2018.
Our wetlab project, ADaPtat1on, involves expanding the toolbox for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 to make it easier to work with the chassis.
We present our project from last year, ChassiDex, with an improved interface and more data and tools. ChassiDex is a software project. It is a database of information on chassis used in synthetic biology, along with CUTE and Comicsyns: tools to make working with a chassis easier.
We have initiated The Language Project, a multilingual science communication project. We have created video content about synthetic biology in 8 Indian languages, and the initiative has quickly expanded to cover over 25 languages.
