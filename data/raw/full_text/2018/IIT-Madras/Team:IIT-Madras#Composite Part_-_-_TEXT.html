Best Composite Part Special Prize
BBaK2857113
The BBaK287113 composite part consists of the P3 promoter (BBa_K2857005) and the RBS generated using the Salis Lab RBS Calculator for use with this promoter in Acinetobacter baylyi. This part was tested in the pBAV1K vector which was transformed into A. baylyi. As seen in the graph below, the synthetic promoter-RBS construct shows significantly higher fluorescence than the control (BBa_K1321309), signifying greater expression strength.
