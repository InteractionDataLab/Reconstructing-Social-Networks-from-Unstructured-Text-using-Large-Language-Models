Best Basic Part Special Prize
BBaK2857001
The BBaK2857001 BioBrick contains GFP codon-optimized for use in Acinetobacter baylyi. The codon-optimized sequence was generated using the CUTE tool from ChassiDex. This part was cloned into the pBAV1K vector and driven by the bacteriophage T5 promoter. This pBAV1K-T5-CO-GFP construct was transformed into A. baylyi and fluorometry studies were carried out. It was found that the codon-optimized GFP shows considerably higher fluorescence than the pBAV1K-T5-eGFP part (BBA_K1321309), containing eGFP codon-optimized for use in E. coli, used as the control, thus demonstrating that CUTE functions as expected and any required gene can be codon-optimized for A. baylyi.
The optimal excitation wavelength for the codon-optimized GFP was found to be 480 nm and the optimal emission wavelength was found to be 512 nm.
