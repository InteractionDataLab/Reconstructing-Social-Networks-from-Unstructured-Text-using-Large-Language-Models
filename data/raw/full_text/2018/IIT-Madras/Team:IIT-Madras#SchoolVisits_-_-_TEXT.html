School Visits
School Visits
School visits are an important part of educational outreach programmes as this involves inspiring young minds. With the aim of increasing curiosity and enthusiasm for synthetic biology among school kids, we decided to conduct sessions in 4 schools in chennai. We wanted this to be a fruitful and memorable experience for the school students. Biotechnology is a very interesting area and its advancements are numerous. What better than to share these exciting innovations in synthetic biology with school students. Hence we prepared a small presentation about iGEM and developed some interesting activities.  The activities involved the following :
Listing out some (maybe 20-30 odd) genes and the proteins they code for and asking the students to design an organism which has some specified characteristics by figuring out which genes are present (basically using the idea of antibiotic selection/ blue white selection etc)
Giving them multiple choice questions about very absurd and cool iGem projects + others and asking them to figure out which of this has been done before.
