Further studies that we wish to do:
Correlating thermodynamic data with the sequence of the promoter region: The experimental and thermodynamic data of the sequences obtained can be correlated with the expression levels of the protein. A model can be built to understand the correlation between the promoter sequences and expression rates.
Troubleshooting, or trying to understand the reason for the extremely high expression rate of P8S.
Characterizing the remaining BioBrick parts.
Testing the promoter library in other chassis such as E. coli and other gram-negative microorganisms.
Generating and using codon-usage tables for other organisms of industrial interest using CUTE.
