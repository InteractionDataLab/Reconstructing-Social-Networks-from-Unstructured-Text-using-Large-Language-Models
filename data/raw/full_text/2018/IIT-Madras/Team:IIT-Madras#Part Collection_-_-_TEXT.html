Part Collection
One of the major objectives of our project is to make a Synthetic promoter library for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1. This can very helpful to scientists working on synthetic biology and metabolic engineering areas. Traditional approaches work on extremes of knocking out a gene or over expression. However, in Synthetic biology experiments, we require stringent promoters that have tight control over the gene expression rate.
We have taken T5-GFP-pBAV1k(BBa_K1321309) as control and normalized the fluorometry data with respect of it.
