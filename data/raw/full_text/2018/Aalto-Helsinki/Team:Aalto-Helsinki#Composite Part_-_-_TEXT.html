Composite Part
Here we list all our composite parts we have made into biobricks. All the composite parts encode colored silk fusion protein with a binding ability to either cellulose or keratin.

RSK BBa_K2467001
mRFP linked to silk repeats and KBD with N- and C- terminal linkers.
This part comprises of chromoprotein monomeric RFP linked to 6 repetitive sequences of spider dragline silk ADF-3 from European garden spider Araneus diadematus and keratin binding domain C from human desmoplakin. Silk repeats are flanked with 23 amino acid long  N- and C-terminal linkers, derived from ADF-3, to prevent the disordered structure of the silk repeats to disturb the folding of chromoprotein and binding domain.
Based on our modeling results, mRFP and KBD are quite stable in higher temperatures. These two combined with the thermostable silk it is possible to purify this construct using heat.
PSK BBa_K2647003
PrancerPurple linked to silk repeats and KBD with N- and C- terminal linkers.
This part comprises of chromoprotein prancerPurple linked to 6 repetitive sequences of spider dragline silk ADF-3 from European garden spider Araneus diadematus and keratin binding domain C from human desmoplakin. Silk repeats are flanked with 23 amino acid long  N- and C-terminal linkers, derived from ADF-3, to prevent the disordered structure of the silk repeats to disturb the folding of chromoprotein and binding domain.
PrancerPurple and silk are stable in higher temperatures as well as KBD based on our modeling results which enables this construct to be purified using heat.
PSC BBa_K2647004
PrancerPurple linked to silk repeats and CBM with N- and C- terminal linkers.
This part comprises of chromoprotein prancerPurple linked to 6 repetitive sequences of spider dragline silk ADF-3 from European garden spider Araneus diadematus and cellulose binding module 3 from Clostridium thermocellum. Silk repeats are flanked with 23 amino acid long  N- and C-terminal linkers, derived from ADF-3, to prevent the disordered structure of the silk repeats to disturb the folding of chromoprotein and binding domain.
PrancerPurple, silk repeats and CBM are all quite stable in higher temperatures which enables this construct to be purified using heat.
