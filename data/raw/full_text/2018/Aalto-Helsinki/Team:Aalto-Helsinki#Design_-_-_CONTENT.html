SILKOLOR is there to provide gain creators and pain relievers based on the insights from the stakeholder research. SILKOLOR is an environmental friendly and energy efficient way of producing dyed silk fibers, which speeds up the transition of a brand to sustainable thinking and further promotes visible contribution and brand reputation. Moreover, thanks to the local self-sufficiency of colored fibers manufacture process, SILKOLOR helps fashion companies build transparency and well-regulation in supply chain.</P><P>Fig 13. Value proposition of SILKOLOR</P><B><P>Solution</P></B><P>Thanks to synthetic biology, we used chromoproteins and combined with spider silk inside E.coli to provide an alternative process of dyed silk fibers. The raw material and fiber dyeing process are combined into a single step, which can be local produced and well-regulated. Since there is no need for transportation between the raw material production and fiber dyeing step, it reduces the carbon footprint, which makes the process more environmentally friendly. With SILKOLOR, we visioned the traditional linear textile value chain can be better-shaped into a more ethical one and generates circular economy.</P><P>Fig 13. Value proposition of SILKOLOR</P><B><P>Benchmarking textile dyeing alternatives</P></B><P>Many challenges still prevent properly commercializing the production of silk protein. The industry has seen several contenders, but only recently one potential company close to scaling up their production enough has emerged: Bolt Threads. The property of supercontraction in the silk seems to necessitate blending the silk yarn with other materials, such as cellulose or wool. Regular silk from silkworms is already expensive material with the price ranging between $60-100 per kilogram, but Bolt Threads have yet to optimize the production, which keeps the cost of their silk above $100 per kilogram.</P><P>Thus, there are many obstacles to prevent large scale production of silk, and we expect that our product of pre-dyed silk fiber would prove even more problematic due to different properties of the material and take well over a decade to properly enter the market with our products. Likewise, genetically engineering silk worms to produce colored silk have posed difficulties, in which limited success has been accomplished with managing to produce green fluorescent silk.  Additionally, mutant strains of silk worms and feeding mulberry leaves containing dyestuff have been successful ways to produce natural colored silks. Therefore, our team has decided to concentrate further on the fusion proteins with colorful chromoproteins combined with cellulose or keratin binding domain.</P><P>Major issues with using natural dyes in comparison to synthetic dyes are numerous.  The challenges of natural dyes matching textile industry’s expectations and requirements include economical price range, wide range of hues and reliable colorfastness. This also may be why synthetic biology and engineered microorganisms could have an important role to shift towards more sustainable production, as some of the reasons for the costliness of natural dyes is their extraction from their source, producing and applying them to textiles. The most common dyeing techniques include exhaust dyeing, continuous dyeing and printing, but it is yet unclear what sort of technique would be most compatible with our bacteria-produced dyestuff.</P><P>Similar goal of utilizing genetically engineered E.coli bacteria has been successfully conducted before, but usually the approach has been different. For example, production of precursor of indigo in E.coli has allowed researchers to circumvent the conventional polluting steps of indigo dyeing by removing the need for both chemical synthesis and also the bleaching stage in fasting the textile. Thus, our dyeing solution may hold great potential due to the cellulose and binding domain that may remove the need for polluting mordants and reduce the excessive use of water.</P><B><P>References</P></B><P>1.
