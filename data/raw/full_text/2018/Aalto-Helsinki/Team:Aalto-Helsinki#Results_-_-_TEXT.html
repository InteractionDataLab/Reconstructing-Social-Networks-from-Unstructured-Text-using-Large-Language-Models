Cloning
We assembled our constructs and cloned them into pSVA1 plasmid using Golden Gate assembly. After transforming plasmids to E.Coli  Beta-10 and plasmid isolation we performed a check-up digestion with restriction enzymes NcoI and XhoI which cut the plasmid backbone close to BsaI insert site.
Protein expression and purification
We were able to successfully purify our silk containing construct prancerPurple-silk-CBM with the heat protocol

Results
Here you can describe the results of your project and your future plans.
What should this page contain?
Clearly and objectively describe the results of your work.
Future plans for the project.
Considerations for replicating the experiments.
Describe what your results mean
Interpretation of the results obtained during your project. Don't just show a plot/figure/graph/other, tell us what you think the data means. This is an important part of your project that the judges will look for.
Show data, but remember all measurement and characterization data must be on part pages in the Registry.
Consider including an analysis summary section to discuss what your results mean. Judges like to read what you think your data means, beyond all the data you have acquired during your project.
Project Achievements
You can also include a list of bullet points (and links) of the successes and failures you have had over your summer. It is a quick reference page for the judges to see what you achieved during your summer.
A list of linked bullet points of the successful results during your project
A list of linked bullet points of the unsuccessful results during your project. This is about being scientifically honest. If you worked on an area for a long time with no success, tell us so we know where you put your effort.
