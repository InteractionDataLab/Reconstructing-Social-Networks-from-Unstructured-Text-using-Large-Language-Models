Our Team participated in iGEMs fifth Interlaboratory Study, a study                     organized by IGEM Measurement Committee in order to identify and correct                     the sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology measurements, so                     that eventually, measurements that are taken in different labs will be no                     more variable than measurements taken within the same lab. This year’s                     InterLab study aims to establish a GFP measurement protocol based on                     engineering principles that anyone with a plate reader can use in their lab                     and normalize fluorescence measurements to absolute cell count or colony                     forming units (CFUs).
To begin with our experiments we needed a plate reader that is qualified to                     measure GFP fluorescence and OD600. In our city, there was no such an                     instrument so we travelled to Alexandroupoli, at the Democritus University                     of Thrace, where we used the Perkin Elmer EnSpine Multimode Plate Reader.                     For all of the callibration protocols and cell measurements we adjusted the                     exitation and emission settings to 485nm and 520nm respectively, the number                     of flashes used was 10 and black plates with clear flat bottom were used.
Calibration Protocols:
Before starting the plate reader measurements , we obtained the OD600                     reference point, the particle standard curve and then the fluorescein                     standard curve.
The OD600 reference point was calculated by using LUDOX CL-X suspension to                     obtain a conversion factor to transform Absorbance (Abs600) data from the                     plate reader into a comparable OD600 measurements that would be obtained in                     a spectrophotometer.
Then, we obtained the particle standard curve by preparing a dilution                     series of mono disperse silica microspheres and measuring the Abs600 in the                     plate reader.
The last calibration protocol was conducted to generate the fluorescence                     standard curve by preparing a dilution series of fluorescein and then                     measuring the fluorescence in the plate reader. Fluorescein is a small                     molecule which has similar excitation and emission properties to GFP, but                     also cost effective and easy to handle.
The standard curve slopes showed a somewhat polynomial shape although they                     were supposed to have a 1:1 slope. This could be due to a consistent                     pipetting error or because of the over saturation of the detector.
Cell Measurement:
The following devices were characterised:
six test devices encoding GFP fused with different promoters and                             RBSs.
BBa_J364000 , BBa_J364001 , BBa_J364002 , BBa_J364007 , BBa_J364008 , BBa_J364009
a positive control BBa_I20270
a negative control BBa_R0040
Each one of the 6 test devices has a different Anderson promoter. So, we                     are expecting different fluorescence levels for each device depending on                     the Anderson promoter used.
Transformation of 8 test devices into competent DH5α cells:
All the plasmids were successfully transformed into DH5a chemically                     competent cells and resulted in a sufficient amount of colonies on all                     plates. Then, two colonies from each plate were picked and inoculated                     overnight (14-16 hours) at 37°C and 220 rpm.
Fluorescence and OD600 Measurement for the Transformed Parts:
The OD600 and the fluorescence of the transformed cells were measured                     according to the protocol after 0 and 6 hours. Measurements of both of                     these time points gave us the following data
Discussion:
Devices 1 and 5 did not grow until the 6 hour timepoint, so the resulted                     fluorescence is not representative of the promoters strenght. In addition,                     Device 4, which had the strongest Anderson Promoter, did not grow as much                     as the other Devices but still the Fluorescence was high. All the other                     devices grew normally and the results we aqcuired were the ones expected.                     Conclusively, we completed our Cell Measurement Protocol with success.
CFU (Colony Forming Units)
This year, for the interlaboratory study, teams measure CFU/ml/0.1OD600 in                     addition to the standard Plate Reader fluorescence measurements as was the                     case in previous years. Here, we document the results of our CFU                     measurements. The protocol proposed at pages 13-14 of the interlab .pdf                     file provided in the interlab page at igem.org, “Protocol: Colony Forming                     Units per 0.1 OD600 E. coli cultures” was faithfully followed.

The Transformations were performed on Frozen Competent DH5α cells (7/12).                     The CFU process (dilutions and plating) took place on 14th of July. The                     next day colonies were counted. All protocols followed were provided by                     iGEM.
