                    This year our Human Practice efforts were divided into 4 different
                    categories, each of them affecting our project and ourselves in a different
                    way. We focused on:
                    <UL><LI>taking into serious consideration ethical issues regarding our
                            project</LI><LI>reaching out to field experts</LI><LI>interacting with people from the industry in order to investigate
                            various possibilities and options for our project</LI><LI>communicating science, synthetic biology and our project across
                            people of different ages, scientific and cultural backgrounds</LI></UL></P><H4>Bioethics</H4><P>
                    One of top priorities during our project’s design and execution was that
                    our project would not raise any ethical concerns. So, we visited the
                    Hellenic National Bioethics Commission, where we discussed with Dr Vidalis.
                    After a presentation of our project and its possible applications, we
                    discussed about the emerging field of Synthetic Biology and the ethical
                    issues that may arise during the process of integrating this new scientific
                    field in statutory legislation. Dr Vidalis, evaluated our project and
                    concluded that it doesn’t directly raise any bioethical questions nor does
                    it pose any threat to individuals, society and the environment, but drew
                    our attention on the rules that should be followed in possible
                    applications. We agreed that many aspects of synthetic biology still need
                    regulation, as products of biological and technological advancements must
                    be utilised in a safe and risk avoiding way. Therefore, the existence of a
                    universal, well-established legislation, is necessary for an emerging field
                    like synthetic biology.
                </P><H4>Academia</H4><P>As we work upon a foundational advance project, providing a genetic toolbox
                    that allows for increased control of gene expression, researchers will be
                    the first to utilize it. Therefore, their feedback would prove of great
                    importance to our project’s design and usage.
                </P><P>
                    For that reason, we contacted numerous field experts, informing them about
                    our project. In addition, we created a synthetic biology survey that
                    investigates:
                    <UL><LI>problems in research</LI><LI>our project’s usefulness</LI><LI>ethical issues that may arise</LI><LI>lab safety</LI></UL></P><H4>Survey Results</H4><P>
                    From the survey result it can be deduced that, apart from funding, lack of
                    reproducibility and interlaboratory variations stand as significant
                    obstacles in research. On another note, researchers use plasmids with
                    different copy numbers for different purposes, which shows that control
                    over the expression level of the gene of interest can be useful.
                </P><H4>Industry</H4><H4>Participation in the 83rd TIF</H4><P>TIF is the most important exhibition event in our country, taking place,
                    annually, in Thessaloniki. Entrepreneurship and innovation are celebrated
                    in TIF, as many leading companies and promising startups display their
                    innovative products and technological advancements. We had the opportunity
                    to participate in this year’s TIF and present our work to decades of
                    visitors every day. In addition, we came in contact with numerous
                    entrepreneurs, company representatives and people from the industry. This
                    allowed to establish a dialog with stakeholders, investigating possible
                    applications of our project beyond the lab.</P><H4>Education And Public Engagement</H4><P>
                    We focused our Public Engagement activities on communicating science across
                    different ages, scientific and cultural backgrounds through a plethora of
                    activities. Within the framework of our multifaceted outreach efforts, we
                    addressed students spanning from elementary school to university level.
                    Additionally, we participated in the OUC-iGEM Team Collaboration,
                    translating a synthetic biology comic book in our language, so that we
                    could provide an accessible and comprehensive visualisation of the
                    molecular mechanisms and engineering principles underlying synthetic
                    biology. As the highlight of our engagement activities, we organized the
                    “SynBalkans Tour”, a series of educational events in universities of 3
                    Balkan Peninsula countries (Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia) about
                    the basics of Synthetic Biology and the iGEM Competition, with a broader
                    emphasis on approaching culturally different groups and establishing an
                    intercultural dialogue. More information can be found in our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Thessaloniki/Public_Engagement">Public

                    on various aspects of our project. We seeked for guidance and feedback from
                    experts of their field and stakeholders. Through their advice and
                    contribution, we improved our project’s design and broadened its possible
                    applications.</P><H4>Project Design and Modeling</H4><P>
                    As we came into communication with many scientists to inform them about our
                    project for this year’s iGEM Competition, we got some responses that shaped
                    our final project design.
                    We came in contact with Thomas H. Segall Shapiro (MIT), PhD. As our project
                    builds upon his work with stabilized promoters, we arranged a Video Call
                    with him. We explained to him the systems we were currently designing and
                    he gave us valuable feedback for the following:
                    <UL><LI><B>For our inducible system:</B> We discussed our concerns about
                            the implementation of the LacI repressor in the TAL Effector system
                            in order to achieve on-the-fly inducibility. Our concern was that
                            there would be steric hindrance between the TAL Effector and the
                            LacI repressor. For that reason, the system would not properly
                            function. He confirmed our concerns and advised us on the use of
                            another type of expression control. <B>So, we opted for the use of
                                a riboswitch instead.</B></LI><LI><B>For our CRISPRi stabilisation system:</B></LI><LI>
                                    We shared with him our idea to use another type of
                                    repressor instead of the TAL
                                    Effectors, to achieve promoter stabilization. We exhibited
                                    our idea to use CRISPRi
                                    and displayed our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Thessaloniki/Design#dcas9-ttd">three
                                        Topology designs</A>
                                    , regarding the positioning(expression site) of dCas9. He
                                    told us that this system could possibly work if dCas9 was
                                    not expressed from the same plasmid as the sgRNA.
                                    <B>We followed his advice and, in order not to disturb the
                                        noncooperative repression, we chose to use <U>Topology
                                            C</U>.</B></LI><LI>
                                    He, also, mentioned that we should take into consideration
                                    the toxicity that dCas9 could pose for the cell.
                                    <B>That is why we investigated this issue and used pTet, an
                                        inducible promoter, to control dCas9 expression.</B>
                                    In order to choose a level of expression adequate for our
                                    system’s function that does not significantly affect
                                    growth, we conducted a dCas9 toxicity measurement,
                                    monitoring the growth of E. coli in different Doxycycline
                                    concentrations at a given time point.
                                </LI></UL><LI><B>For Fluorescence Measurements:</B>
                            As we had not decided on whether we would measure fluorescence
                            using a plate reader or a flow cytometer, we asked Thomas H. Segall
                            Shapiro his opinion on that matter. He guided us towards the use of
                            flow cytometry, as this method could provide us more accurate and
                            detailed results, and recommended us a
                            <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Thessaloniki/Experiments#flow-measurements">protocol</A>
                            he had worked on before.
                        </LI></P><P>
                    Our <B>survey result</B> showed that there was not a clear preference
                    between on the fly <B>inducibility</B> or <B>tuning</B>
                    of stabilised promoters in order to achieve the required expression level.
                    Both designs have their own uses and advantages.
                    <B>So, we decided to include both of these options into our toolbox.</B>
                    For the tuning (of TAL effector) stabilised promoters, we included
                    <B>different promoter-RBS combinations</B>.
                    To achieve on the fly inducibility of the TAL Effector system we decided on
                    the use of a <B>riboswitch</B>
                    Therefore, in our contact with <B>Prof Howard M. Salis</B>, he ensured us
                    that <B>a theophylline riboswitch with a high dynamic range would be an
                        excellent choice</B>,
                    as theophylline readily enters bacterial cells, it is not metabolized by E.
                    coli, and it binds strongly to its RNA aptamer inside the riboswitch.
                    
                    Regarding the <B>choice of fluorescent marker</B> he told us that both
                    sfGFP and RFP would work fine, but since the AEB--Theo-27 riboswitch
                    currently uses luciferase as the reporter gene of interest we couldn't
                    simply replace the current coding sequence (CDS) with another one. He
                    advised us to use luciferase as a reporter or create a fusion protein that
                    consists of the first 99 nucleotides of the currently used CDS
                    (luciferase), followed by our desired gene of interest without inserting a
                    stop or start codon in the middle of the CDS fusion. So, as we could not
                    measure luminescence levels we designed a
                    <B>fusion luciferase-sfGFP protein</B>.
                </P><P>
                    We visited the <B>Institute of Applied Biosciences, CERTH (Centre of
                        Research &amp; Technology Hellas)</B>
                    in Thessaloniki, Greece, where we discussed about our project with
                    scientists from the biotechnology field. Dr Antonios Makris, who is working
                    on metabolic engineering in Saccharomyces, informed us about copy number
                    variations in yeast and how they might affect the functionality of an
                    engineered system. Our conversation with him gave us the necessary
                    information to further investigate the usage of our stabilized systems in
                    yeast.
                </P><P>
                    We also visited <B>Dr Tefas</B>, Associate Professor, School of
                    Informatics, AUTh, to ask about network optimization. After discussing
                    about our work and defining the optimization problem, he described to us
                    methods to find the optimal parameters for our systems. We ended up using
                    robustness analysis over a gradient descent algorithm as he suggested,
                    because computational cost was not a problem, as we didn't have many
                    unknown parameters or big ranges for their values.
                </P><H4>Project Applications - Interaction with Stakeholders</H4><P>As we wanted to expand the purpose of our project and investigate its
                    possible applications outside of the lab we had meetings and discussions
                    with several stakeholders from our country.</P><P><B>Macedonian Thrace Brewery</B> is one of the leading beer making
                    companies in Greece that prioritizes research and innovation in order to
                    grow their product library and constantly improve their products. As were
                    interested in investigating the possible applications of our project in
                    brewery we decided to came in contact with the company. After a tour in
                    their facilities in Komotini where we experienced the brewing process, we
                    had the opportunity to discuss with chief executive officer Christos
                    Dimtsoudis and members of the R&amp;D department, about the
                    <B>implementation of our project in mass production</B>
                    in order to decrease the concentration of byproducts in beer and improve
                    its quality through gene control in yeast.
                </P><P><B>ELPEN</B> is a pharmaceutical company based in Greece with a strong
                    focus on the development of novel pharmaceutical products. We visited their
                    Headquarters and presented our project in front of Anna Maria Chronopoulou,
                    Head of Corporate Communication &amp; Corporate Social Responsibility and
                    Georgia Papaioannou, Communication and Market Access Associate. After a
                    fruitful conversation,
                    <B>we investigated the utilization of our project for the stabilization of
                        metabolic pathways in the development and production of pharmaceutical
                        compounds</B>
                    and, more specifically, its use over conventional methods, such as
                    extraction or chemical synthesis.
