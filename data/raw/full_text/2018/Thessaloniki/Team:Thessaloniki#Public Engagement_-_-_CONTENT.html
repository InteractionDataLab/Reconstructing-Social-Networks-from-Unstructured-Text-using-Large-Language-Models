                    As a project competing in the foundational advance track, we faced
                    difficulties in our efforts to properly communicate our work. We contacted
                    Asterios Arampatzis, Team Leader of iGEM Greece 2017, in order to gain some
                    insight about the problems they may have met and dealt with, regarding the
                    communication of Synthetic Biology and their project to the world. He
                    shared with us his experience, stating that synthetic biology is nearly
                    absent from our country, as the public has not been properly informed and
                    there are not many researchers in the field.
                </P><P>
                    This year, we wanted to make sure that the iGEM Foundation, and synthetic
                    biology in general, would come in attention of a larger audience. We aimed
                    to inform people of various ages, scientific backgrounds and nationalities
                    about this new and exciting, yet relatively unknown in our country,
                    scientific field, raise awareness about genetic engineering, discuss about
                    the important ethical issues that come up with synthetic biology’s constant
                    growth and receive valuable feedback for our project’s application and
                    importance to the world.
                </P><P>  We organized numerous activities, differentiating our approach depending on
                    the audience. In order to familiarize them with synthetic biology we
                    presented several iGEM projects from previous years that we believed,
                    demonstrate that synthetic biology can prove beneficial in real world
                    problems. We, also, wanted to communicate our project, so wee could gain
                    some feedback and understand the public’s reception of it.
                </P><P>
                    Finally, taking into consideration public’s feedback, we wanted to address
                    the issue of science communication to the public. So, the <B>highlight of
                        our
                        activities</B> this year was the organization of the <B>“SynBalkans
                        Tour”</B>, an
                    educational effort in order to broaden the knowledge about synthetic
                    biology in the Balkan Region, considering the different cultural and
                    scientific background of the audience.

                                    The highlight of our public engagement efforts was the
                                    organization of the <B>“SynBalkans Tour”</B>, a series of
                                    events
                                    dedicated to science communication across the Balkan
                                    region.
                                    Through this tour, our goal was to form <B>a lasting

                                    cooperation between institutes in the Balkan Peninsula and
                                    provide students with the opportunity to get acquainted
                                    with a
                                    novel scientific branch, synthetic biology.

                                    Before going on tour, we wanted to make sure that we would
                                    be
                                    able to engage people with different cultural and

                                    could
                                    differentiate our approach in each country, always taking
                                    into

                                    Apart from cultural differences we, also, had to take into

                                    to attend our event, as synthetic biology is characterized
                                    by
                                    interdisciplinarity. For this reason, we chose to

                                    Biology. First, we <B>introduced our team</B> to the
                                    audience.
                                    Next, we explained the <B>principles of synthetic biology</B>
                                    and
                                    mentioned some of its <B>applications</B> (i.e. quorum

                                    After we wrapped up our presentation, we discussed with
                                    students and professors about synthetic biology and the
                                    iGEM Competition. Students showed interest in learning more
                                    about the engineering principles of synthetic biology. We
                                    were happy to elaborate on the use of logic gates and
                                    explain them terms such as orthogonality and robustness.

                                        All professors welcomed the idea of organizing a second visit in the balkan region, where we would have the opportunity to interact with students through synthetic biology workshops.
                                </P><P>
                                        Dr Jasna Puizina, University of Split, told us that she was impressed that undergraduate students were involved in such a contemporary branch of science. She wanted to learn more about the iGEM Competition and shared with us her interest about the formation of an interbalkan iGEM team. She concluded that she will initiate discussions so that synthetic biology courses will be added in the faculty’s curriculum.
                                </P><P>
                                        We also had a discussion with Dr Alen Mujcinovic, University of Sarajevo, as he was interested in the entrepreneurship side of iGEM and synthetic biology’s applications in agriculture. He thought that involvement in the iGEM Competition would be a great opportunity for students of the faculty.
                                </P><H4>Conclusion</H4><P>
                                        As this was our first time presenting in front of such a large audience in English, we believe that this experience will prove very useful to us. We managed to communicate our work to people of other nationalities and interacted with numerous researchers in the Balkan region receiving their comments about our work.
                                </P><P>
                                        Students participating in our event got to know a lot about Synthetic Biology and, through examples &amp; discussion, understood how synthetic biological circuits can be used in real-world applications.
                                </P><P>
                                        We have already made plans to continue our activities in the Balkan region, with the organization of interactive workshops and presentations.

                                                After speeches from Dr K. Vavitsas (An

                                                iGEM Athens and iGEM Greece (2017) presented
                                                their projects to the audience. When the
                                                presentations were over, Yvoni (iGEM
                                                Thessaloniki) and Giannis (iGEM Athens) spoke
                                                about the applications of engineering
                                                principles in synthetic biology and explained
                                                the use of some basic synthetic biology tools
                                                (e.g. toggle switch, oscillator, riboswitch) in
                                                order for the participants to be able to use
                                                them in their brainstorming sessions. Leda
                                                (iGEM Athens) talked about the safety
                                                precautions and evaluation process that a
                                                project should pass in order to be considered
                                                safe.

                                                The students were then divided into subgroups
                                                and participated in a brainstorming session in
                                                order to solve real world problems using
                                                synthetic biology circuits, with help from
                                                members of iGEM teams. Finally, they managed to
                                                come up with innovative ways to tackle problems
                                                such as wound healing, forest restoration and
                                                infant food allergies. In the end, the
                                                participants presented the ideas they had come
                                                up with and before leaving they were asked to
                                                fill in a short questionnaire regarding their
                                                experience in the workshop.

                                                Students of the faculty of Pharmacy, AUTH,
                                                invited us to the Pharmacology Club where we
                                                gave a speech about Synthetic Biology and its

                                                Pharmacology. We spoke to them about the
                                                production of artemisinin, an antimalarial
                                                pharmaceutical compound, from yeast and
                                                explained the advantages of this method of
                                                production compared to the traditional
                                                isolation of artemisinin from the
                                                pharmaceutical plant. We, also, gave them
                                                examples of iGEM Projects in the diagnostics
                                                and therapeutics tracks. Specifically, we
                                                presented the pANDORA (iGEM Greece 2017,

                                                after that we had an in depth conversation with
                                                the students about the synthetic biology
                                                circuits used in the aforementioned projects,
                                                as well as the safety concerns they took into
                                                consideration. We enjoyed interacting with
                                                students that are eager to learn about science
                                                beyond the classroom, gaining insight in the
                                                measures that have to be taken for the
                                                appropriate management of the safety risks of

                                                We visited Zarifeios Akadimia, a primary school
                                                in Alexandroupoli, in order to spark the
                                                students’ interest for science and introduce
                                                them to the concept of synthetic biology. As we
                                                wanted to actively include them in our
                                                activity, we used candy as an example of DNA’s
                                                structure and characteristics to construct an
                                                edible DNA helix. Different color candy standed
                                                for different nitrogenous bases, representing
                                                how complementarity works in the DNA. Each
                                                student built a different “DNA sequence” by
                                                selecting different colored candy. This is how
                                                we managed to explain that, in synthetic
                                                biology, scientists can design their own DNA
                                                sequences in order to achieve the desired
                                                result. In addition, the students, with our
                                                assistance, isolated DNA from bananas. This
                                                way, we displayed that the DNA is not an
                                                abstract concept, but it is a molecule of vital
                                                importance that exists in every living
                                                organism.

                                                Student-Run Biology Workshop (SRBW) is a
                                                congress organized by students of the
                                                Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics
                                                from the Democritus University of Thrace,
                                                taking place in Alexandroupoli. The goal of the
                                                congress is to bring students from all over the
                                                country together, so that they can meet with
                                                colleagues from different universities, get
                                                hands-on experience and create presentations
                                                and talks about interesting scientific topics.
                                                So, we thought that the 3rd SRBW was an
                                                excellent chance for us to introduce Synthetic
                                                Biology to a crowd full of future scientists.
                                                We gave a speech about Synthetic Biology, its
                                                origins, tools and its vast number of

                                                At the high school level, we came in contact
                                                with two major educational institutions,
                                                “Eniaio Ekpaideutiko Kentron” and “Frontistirio
                                                Agrafiotis”. The owners and professors showed
                                                interest in our project and we wanted to make
                                                sure that the students could learn about an
                                                interdisciplinary branch of science, synthetic
                                                biology, as well as understand our project.
                                                Even though we came in with high hopes, we
                                                could not have imagined the amount of questions
                                                and excitement that the students shown. During
                                                our presentation, we explained them the basics

                                                In our country, the final years of high school
                                                tend to be very stressful and taxing for
                                                students [1]. The PanHellenic exams are very
                                                competitive and, on top of that, students
                                                confront the difficult task of deciding their
                                                school of preference/ preferred field of study/
                                                career orientation in such a young age. We, as
                                                an iGEM Team, are characterised by
                                                interdisciplinarity and many of us could not
                                                ever imagine that we would be involved in the
                                                design of a biological system in an
                                                undergraduate level. So, we made an effort to
                                                highlight that interdisciplinarity [2] is one
                                                of the main characteristics of modern academia
                                                and industry, as well as that there are a lot
                                                of opportunities to evolve and get into novel
                                                scientific branches, such as Synthetic Biology.
                                                Therefore, we believe that our interaction with
                                                the students gave them the chance to learn
                                                about contemporary science beyond school books.
                                                In addition, we gave them examples proving that
                                                their chosen field of study is not confining
                                                and, through interdisciplinarity, they can
                                                pursue their goals and get involved in exciting
                                                projects and activities. We were thankful to
                                                have the chance to promote science in such an
                                                interactive way, and have made plans to further
                                                extend our outreach after the competition.
