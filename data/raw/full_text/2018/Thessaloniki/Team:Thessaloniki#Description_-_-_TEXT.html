Project Description
1.Motivation
Since the very first days of our brainstorming, our primary objective was                     to create something that could have an immediate impact on the scientific                     community. Among other things, the unpredictability that characterizes                     biological systems immediately drew our attention. Even though Synthetic                     Biology has come a long way in designing orthogonal and predictable                     systems, there are still many interfering factors, obstructing consistency                     and functionality.                     One such factor is gene/plasmid copy number. For that reason we decided to                     create a tool that enhances stability and robustness of synthetic                     biological systems. We achieve that by engineering stabilized promoters                     which produce the same output regardless of their biological context in                     order to render synthetic biological systems more predictable and reliable.
2.Why is Copy Number independence useful?
Despite the fact that copy number is, usually, regarded as being constant,                     many factors related with the internal and external environment of the cell                     contribute to copy number variation both over time and between different                     cells. [2]
Gene Expression is characterised by a positive correlation with the plasmid                     copy number.                     Thus, variations in copy number lead to variations in gene expression,                     affecting the function of the system. Particularly, in complex systems that                     require high precision, such as metabolic pathways and multi-input logic                     gates, accumulation of perturbations caused by variations in their                     individual parts greatly affect the functionality of said system.
Regulating the expression strength is usually achieved via the replacement                     of regulatory elements such as RBSs and Promoters. Still, this does not                     ensure a predictable behaviour over different genetic contexts, therefore                     re-tuning is mandatory to maintain the system’s proper function.
3.GALENE
This year we built upon the work of Shapiro et. al., [1] implementing an                     incoherent FeedForward Loop network motif that consists of a regulatory                     element which compensates for changes in copy number, thus stabilizing the                     promoter. We provide Galene to the iGEM Community, a genetic toolbox that                     enhances the stability of biological systems by disassociating                     transcription from gene copy number and provides translational control of                     protein production.
Stabilized promoters are promoter sequences that achieve expression                     independent of gene/plasmid copy number. They possess great potential for                     usage as a synthetic biology tool with many applications, ranging from part                     characterization to metabolic pathway and genetic circuitry fine-tuning [].                     Balancing gene expression in synthetic biological systems is a key                     parameter for their proper function. By achieving gene/plasmid copy number                     independence, such systems become more robust, predictable and less prone                     to perturbations arising from both their internal and external environment.
Through model driven feedback , we accomplish promoter                     stabilization                     using 2 distinct systems, each with its own advantages: TAL Effectors and CRISPR interference.                     We have, also, designed and simulated a 3rd stabilization                     system using Attenuator-interacting sRNA regulators.
Wanting to expand on the stabilized promoters system, we designed a                     theophylline Riboswitch that would allow, on top of the stabilization of a                     promoter, its induction and activation to the desired expression level.

4.Possible Applications of Stabilized Promoters
Genome Insertion
The output of genetic circuits inserted into the genome is affected both by                     the number of inserted copies and their distance from the Origin of                     Replication (ORI). [3] Stabilized promoter systems can be transferred to                     genome, maintaining the circuit’s level of expression, independent of the                     position of the inserted gene relative with the origin of replication.
Medicine
Precise control of genetic systems is of utmost importance when they are                     applied for therapeutic purposes. [4] Stabilized promoters can be used to                     introduce predictability and increase specificity in contemporary                     therapeutic methods, such as gene and cancer therapies, which are based                     upon the implementation of sophisticated synthetic biological circuits.
Toxic Protein Production
Production of highly toxicity proteins requires tight control of gene                     expression, so that sufficient expression can be achieved before host cells                     become dysfunctional. [5] Stabilized promoters can be used for sufficient                     expression before toxicity in the host cells comes into play.
Metabolic Engineering
The enzymes participating in metabolic pathways must be expressed in                     certain stoichiometric ratios, as variability in their expression could                     disrupt the system’s proper function. [6] Stabilized promoters can be                     utilized as regulatory tools for the expression of genes participating in                     metabolic pathways, increasing the system’s robustness and performance.
Large Scale Production
Genetic Systems used for industrial production require high fidelity to                     cope with the varying conditions inside a bioreactor [7] that might                     influence plasmid’s copy number. On those lines, stabilizing the expression                     of genes crucial in the production process, has the potential to increase                     the yield. Copy Number variation can influence the expression of fermentation-related genes in organisms used for industrial                     production,                     such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. [8] Stabilized promoters can be a                     valuable tool for the control of genes related the process of fermentation                     and, therefore, improve the quality of the final product.
