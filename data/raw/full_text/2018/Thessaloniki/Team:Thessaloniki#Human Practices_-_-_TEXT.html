Human Practices
Introduction
This year our Human Practice efforts were divided into 4 different                     categories, each of them affecting our project and ourselves in a different                     way. We focused on:
taking into serious consideration ethical issues regarding our                             project
reaching out to field experts
interacting with people from the industry in order to investigate                             various possibilities and options for our project
communicating science, synthetic biology and our project across                             people of different ages, scientific and cultural backgrounds
Bioethics
One of top priorities during our project’s design and execution was that                     our project would not raise any ethical concerns. So, we visited the                     Hellenic National Bioethics Commission, where we discussed with Dr Vidalis.                     After a presentation of our project and its possible applications, we                     discussed about the emerging field of Synthetic Biology and the ethical                     issues that may arise during the process of integrating this new scientific                     field in statutory legislation. Dr Vidalis, evaluated our project and concluded that it doesn’t directly raise any bioethical questions nor does                     it pose any threat to individuals, society and the environment, but drew                     our attention on the rules that should be followed in possible                     applications. We agreed that many aspects of synthetic biology still need                     regulation, as products of biological and technological advancements must                     be utilised in a safe and risk avoiding way. Therefore, the existence of a                     universal, well-established legislation, is necessary for an emerging field                     like synthetic biology.
Academia
As we work upon a foundational advance project, providing a genetic toolbox                     that allows for increased control of gene expression, researchers will be                     the first to utilize it. Therefore, their feedback would prove of great                     importance to our project’s design and usage.
For that reason, we contacted numerous field experts, informing them about                     our project. In addition, we created a synthetic biology survey that                     investigates:
problems in research
our project’s usefulness
ethical issues that may arise
lab safety
Survey Results
From the survey result it can be deduced that, apart from funding, lack of                     reproducibility and interlaboratory variations stand as significant                     obstacles in research. On another note, researchers use plasmids with                     different copy numbers for different purposes, which shows that control                     over the expression level of the gene of interest can be useful.
Industry
Participation in the 83rd TIF
TIF is the most important exhibition event in our country, taking place,                     annually, in Thessaloniki. Entrepreneurship and innovation are celebrated                     in TIF, as many leading companies and promising startups display their                     innovative products and technological advancements. We had the opportunity                     to participate in this year’s TIF and present our work to decades of                     visitors every day. In addition, we came in contact with numerous                     entrepreneurs, company representatives and people from the industry. This                     allowed to establish a dialog with stakeholders, investigating possible                     applications of our project beyond the lab.
Education And Public Engagement
We focused our Public Engagement activities on communicating science across                     different ages, scientific and cultural backgrounds through a plethora of                     activities. Within the framework of our multifaceted outreach efforts, we                     addressed students spanning from elementary school to university level.                     Additionally, we participated in the OUC-iGEM Team Collaboration,                     translating a synthetic biology comic book in our language, so that we                     could provide an accessible and comprehensive visualisation of the                     molecular mechanisms and engineering principles underlying synthetic                     biology. As the highlight of our engagement activities, we organized the                     “SynBalkans Tour”, a series of educational events in universities of 3                     Balkan Peninsula countries (Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia) about                     the basics of Synthetic Biology and the iGEM Competition, with a broader                     emphasis on approaching culturally different groups and establishing an                     intercultural dialogue.

Introduction
Throughout our journey in the iGEM competition we gained valuable feedback                     on various aspects of our project. We seeked for guidance and feedback from                     experts of their field and stakeholders. Through their advice and                     contribution, we improved our project’s design and broadened its possible                     applications.
Project Design and Modeling
As we came into communication with many scientists to inform them about our                     project for this year’s iGEM Competition, we got some responses that shaped                     our final project design.                     We came in contact with Thomas H. Segall Shapiro (MIT), PhD. As our project                     builds upon his work with stabilized promoters, we arranged a Video Call                     with him. We explained to him the systems we were currently designing and                     he gave us valuable feedback for the following:
For our inducible system: We discussed our concerns about                             the implementation of the LacI repressor in the TAL Effector system                             in order to achieve on-the-fly inducibility. Our concern was that                             there would be steric hindrance between the TAL Effector and the                             LacI repressor. For that reason, the system would not properly                             function. He confirmed our concerns and advised us on the use of                             another type of expression control. So, we opted for the use of                                 a riboswitch instead.
For our CRISPRi stabilisation system:
We shared with him our idea to use another type of                                     repressor instead of the TAL                                     Effectors, to achieve promoter stabilization. We exhibited                                     our idea to use CRISPRi                                     and displayed our three                                         Topology designs , regarding the positioning(expression site) of dCas9. He                                     told us that this system could possibly work if dCas9 was                                     not expressed from the same plasmid as the sgRNA. We followed his advice and, in order not to disturb the noncooperative repression, we chose to use Topology                                             C.
He, also, mentioned that we should take into consideration                                     the toxicity that dCas9 could pose for the cell. That is why we investigated this issue and used pTet, an                                         inducible promoter, to control dCas9 expression. In order to choose a level of expression adequate for our                                     system’s function that does not significantly affect                                     growth, we conducted a dCas9 toxicity measurement,                                     monitoring the growth of E. coli in different Doxycycline                                     concentrations at a given time point.
For Fluorescence Measurements: As we had not decided on whether we would measure fluorescence                             using a plate reader or a flow cytometer, we asked Thomas H. Segall                             Shapiro his opinion on that matter. He guided us towards the use of                             flow cytometry, as this method could provide us more accurate and                             detailed results, and recommended us a protocol he had worked on before.
Our survey result showed that there was not a clear preference                     between on the fly inducibility or tuning of stabilised promoters in order to achieve the required expression level.                     Both designs have their own uses and advantages.
So, we decided to include both of these options into our toolbox. For the tuning (of TAL effector) stabilised promoters, we included different promoter-RBS combinations.                     To achieve on the fly inducibility of the TAL Effector system we decided on                     the use of a riboswitch Therefore, in our contact with Prof Howard M. Salis, he ensured us                     that a theophylline riboswitch with a high dynamic range would be an                         excellent choice,                     as theophylline readily enters bacterial cells, it is not metabolized by E.                     coli, and it binds strongly to its RNA aptamer inside the riboswitch.
Regarding the choice of fluorescent marker he told us that both                     sfGFP and RFP would work fine, but since the AEB--Theo-27 riboswitch                     currently uses luciferase as the reporter gene of interest we couldn't                     simply replace the current coding sequence (CDS) with another one. He                     advised us to use luciferase as a reporter or create a fusion protein that                     consists of the first 99 nucleotides of the currently used CDS                     (luciferase), followed by our desired gene of interest without inserting a                     stop or start codon in the middle of the CDS fusion. So, as we could not                     measure luminescence levels we designed a fusion luciferase-sfGFP protein.
We visited the Institute of Applied Biosciences, CERTH (Centre of Research & Technology Hellas) in Thessaloniki, Greece, where we discussed about our project with                     scientists from the biotechnology field. Dr Antonios Makris, who is working                     on metabolic engineering in Saccharomyces, informed us about copy number                     variations in yeast and how they might affect the functionality of an                     engineered system. Our conversation with him gave us the necessary                     information to further investigate the usage of our stabilized systems in                     yeast.
We also visited Dr Tefas, Associate Professor, School of                     Informatics, AUTh, to ask about network optimization. After discussing                     about our work and defining the optimization problem, he described to us                     methods to find the optimal parameters for our systems. We ended up using                     robustness analysis over a gradient descent algorithm as he suggested,                     because computational cost was not a problem, as we didn't have many                     unknown parameters or big ranges for their values.
Project Applications - Interaction with Stakeholders
As we wanted to expand the purpose of our project and investigate its                     possible applications outside of the lab we had meetings and discussions                     with several stakeholders from our country.
Macedonian Thrace Brewery is one of the leading beer making                     companies in Greece that prioritizes research and innovation in order to                     grow their product library and constantly improve their products. As were                     interested in investigating the possible applications of our project in                     brewery we decided to came in contact with the company. After a tour in                     their facilities in Komotini where we experienced the brewing process, we                     had the opportunity to discuss with chief executive officer Christos                     Dimtsoudis and members of the R&D department, about the implementation of our project in mass production in order to decrease the concentration of byproducts in beer and improve                     its quality through gene control in yeast.
ELPEN is a pharmaceutical company based in Greece with a strong                     focus on the development of novel pharmaceutical products. We visited their                     Headquarters and presented our project in front of Anna Maria Chronopoulou,                     Head of Corporate Communication & Corporate Social Responsibility and                     Georgia Papaioannou, Communication and Market Access Associate. After a                     fruitful conversation, we investigated the utilization of our project for the stabilization of                         metabolic pathways in the development and production of pharmaceutical                         compounds and, more specifically, its use over conventional methods, such as                     extraction or chemical synthesis.
