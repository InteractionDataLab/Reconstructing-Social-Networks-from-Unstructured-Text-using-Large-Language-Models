Interlaboratory Measurement Collaboration
In light of this year’s Interlab study, we wanted to further assist this                     initiative by conducting an Interlab study of our own by measuring the                     constructs we have designed. We wanted to investigate whether stabilized                     promoters would reduce variability in interlaboratory fluorescence                     measurements exhibited by engineered genetic constructs across different                     laboratories. (Jake et al.)
Fluctuations observed in plasmid copy number are caused by small changes in                     the cell’s environment as well as the cell itself. For example, differences                     in growth temperature and growth medium composition affect the copy number                     of plasmids. Such variations may be more apparent between labs (e.g.                     differences in lab equipment, handling), becoming a major hindrance in                     scientific research.
The measurement protocol was the same as the one performed for the plate                     reader measurements in this years interlab study. There were 4 Test                     Devices:
TD1 and TD2 contained pupsp1 and pupsp2, two constitutive promoters                             .
TD3 and TD4 contained TALEsp1 stabilized pupsp1 and TALEsp2 stabilized pupsp2 promoters.
Due to the fact that the teams that took part in our Interlaboratory                     Measurement had, also, participated in the iGEM Interlaboratory                     Measurement, so they provided us with the interlab negative control and                     calibration data.

Participating Teams:
iGEM Imperial
iGEM Marburg
iGEM Rice
iGEM GIfu
Unfortunately due to time constraints we could not ask teams to repeat measurements that were affected from oversaturation. Still, we want to thank iGEM Marburg, iGEM Imperial, iGEM Rice and iGEM Gifu for their participation in our interlab collab.
iGEM Marburg Collaboration
We participated in the Interlaboratory Measurement organized by iGEM Marburg . We measured OD600 of Vibrio natriegens culture, grown at 37                     degrees, at various time points. The growth curve was used to examine the                     growth of V. natriegens.
OUC-China
We participated in the OUC-China Team Collaboration by translating the                     comic book they created in our language in order to use this as an                     education material for our Public Engagement Efforts.
iGEM Athens
In collaboration with iGEM                         Athens , we organized the first Synthetic Biology                     workshop in Greece. The “SynBio Workshop” took place in Athens, in the 5th                     of July. Students from various backgrounds, such as medicine, engineering                     and mathematics, had the opportunity to participate in a hands-on workshop,                     designing creative solutions to real life problems using synthetic biology                     principles, with the help of iGEM Thessaloniki and iGEM Athens members. For                     more details visit our public engagement page .
We filled in surveys from
iGEM Uppsala
iGEM San Diego
iGEM Bordeaux
iGEM Bulgaria
iGEM Imperial
From our side, we would like to thank all the iGEM Teams who forwarded our                     Synthetic Biology Survey to their instructors, advisors and PIs.
