The ultimate goal of our project was the design of stabilized promoters                     that achieve constant gene expression regardless of their genetic context.                     We created a functional toolbox that enhances stability and robustness of                     synthetic biological systems by decoupling gene expression from copy                     number.
We demonstrate that our project worked as expected by achieving gene                     expression decoupled from copy number.
TALE Stabilized Promoters
In order to investigate the function of TALEsp1-Pupsp1 stabilized                         promoter ( BBa_K2839000 ) and TALEsp2-Pupsp2                         stabilized promoter ( BBa_K2839014 ) we                     measured their fluorescence, as well as the fluorescence of a constitutive                         promoter across 3 plasmids with different Origins of Replication                     (psc101,                     p15A, pUC19-derived pMB1). For the sfGFP fluorescence intensity                     measurements, flow cytometry was our primary measuring method, while a                     plate reader was also used.
Fluorescence Intensity Measurements of the Constructs were conducted into                     DH5a E.coli cells

Error bars represent                         standard deviation from three biological replicates.

Error bars represent                         standard deviation from three biological replicates.
The results demonstrate that sfGFP expression level, under the control of TALEsp1-Pupsp1 stabilized promoter ( ) and TALEsp2-Pupsp2                         stabilized promoter ( BBa_K2839014 ),                     remains stable when expressed from                     vectors with different copy number. Whereas, sfGFP expression driven from a                     non stabilized constitutive promoter changes when different copy number                     plasmids are used for its expression.
Inducibility
Expanding our system, we implemented a theophylline responsive riboswitch                     ( BBa_K2839017 ) to the                     TALE stabilized promoters and demonstrated that they                     can be induced to the desired expression level.
Figure 3. Theo27 response to differential induction by theophylline.                         Fluorescence was measured 7 hours after initial induction with                         theophylline.

Fusion of sfGFP with 33 amino-acids from the protein luciferase, allows the                     riboswitch to function properly and respond to different concentrations of                     theophylline.

Fluorescence Intensity Measurements of the TALEsp1 stabilized Promoter with                     translational Control ( BBa_K2839012 )                     were conducted into DH5a E.coli cells, using pSB1C3 vector.
The results prove that the riboswitch responds to theophylline changing itâ€™s                     conformation and thus allowing translation initiation. Furthermore,it is                     clear that increasing the concentration of theophylline leads to higher                     expression levels.
