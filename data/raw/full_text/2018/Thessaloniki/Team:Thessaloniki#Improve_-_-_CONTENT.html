                    We submitted <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2839017">BBa_K2839017</A>
                    as an improvement over <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K784005">BBa_K784005</A>,
                    a theophylline riboswitch designed by
                    iGEM12_Technion Team.
                </P><P>
                    Theophylline Riboswitches can be used for the conditional control of gene
                    expression. In the absence of theophylline, the RNA transcript coding for
                    the fluorescent marker forms a stem loop that limits the access of
                    ribosomes to the ribosome binding site (RBS), thus inhibiting translation
                    initiation. With the addition of theophylline this loop undergoes a
                    conformational change, allowing the binding of the ribosome at the RBS and
                    permitting translation initiation.
                    As, the main focus of our project is the precise control of gene
                    expression, we implemented a <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2839017">Theophylline
                        Riboswitch</A> in the TAL Effector
                    stabilization system, granting inducibility. Therefore, we achieve
                    theophylline-dependent gene expression , decoupled from copy number.
                </P><P>
                    According to the experimental data submitted by <B>iGEM12_Technion</B>
                    Team, the
                    theophylline riboswitch they used did not respond to changes in
                    theophylline concentration. We concluded that the lack of functionality
                    possibly stemmed from a disturbance in the riboswitch’s conformation. We
                    wanted to investigate whether mCherry coding sequence, which was the
                    reporter that Team Technion used, affected the riboswitch’s secondary
                    structure. Therefore, in order to restore it’s function, we initially
                    replaced the mCherry fluorescent marker with sfGFP. From the flow cytometry
                    measurements,we observed no fluorescence and thus no functionality. As a
                    second approach, we used sfGFP protein fused with the first 99 nucleotides
                    of luciferase, as we believed it i not interact with the aptamer sequence.

                    expressing sfGFP were inserted in pSB1C3 backbone,
                    in order to determine their functionality. To examine whether activation of
                    sfGFP expression was dose-dependent, cells were treated with 4 different
                    Theophylline Concentrations: 0.5 mM, 1 mM, 2mM and 8mM.
                    The results indicated that higher doses of Theophylline lead to higher
                    fluorescence levels in the <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2839017">BBa_K2839017</A>
                    riboswitch, which uses
                    sfGFP-luciferase fusion protein as a reporter. On the contrary, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K784005">BBa_K784005</A>
                    did not exhibit any fluorescence in the Theophylline concentrations tested.

                    We restored <A href="ttp://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K784005">BBa_K784005</A>
                    functionality using N-terminal Fusion sfGFP with
                    the first 99 nucleotides of luciferase. The 99 nucleotides of luciferase
                    can be fused with proteins that remain functional upon N-terminal
                    addition,ensuring the riboswitch’s proper function.
