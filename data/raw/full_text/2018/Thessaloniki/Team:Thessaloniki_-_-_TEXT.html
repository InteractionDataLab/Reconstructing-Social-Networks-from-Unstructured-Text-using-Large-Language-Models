Gene expression is unpredictable, noisy and prone to perturbations,                             thus posing a challenge towards designing reliable and functional                             systems. One of the most decisive factors affecting the                             functionality of synthetic biological systems is gene copy number                             variation, that gives rise to variability in gene expression.
We provide Galene, a genetic toolbox that enhances system                             stability by disassociating gene expression from copy number and                             provides translational control of protein production.
The former is achieved by implementing a type I incoherent                                 feed-forward loop network motif that consists of a regulatory                                 element which compensates for changes in copy number, thus                                 stabilizing the promoter. Through model-driven                                     feedback , stabilization by utilizing 2 distinct systems, each with its                                 own                                 advantages and appropriate uses. CRISPR interference, TAL                                     Effectors.
In addition, we designed and simulated a 3rd stabilization system, based on transcriptional                                     attenuator-interacting sRNAs
Going one step further, we implemented a theophylline aptamer that                             regulates translation and allows for the induction at the desired                             expression level.
This year, our Human                                 Practice efforts were divided into 4 different                             categories, each of them affecting our project and ourselves in a                             different way. We focused on:                             taking into serious consideration ethical issues regarding our                             project,                             reaching out to field experts, interacting with people from the industry in order to investigate                             various possibilities and options for our project,                             and communicating                                 science , synthetic biology and our project across                             people of different ages, scientific and cultural backgrounds. As a                             highlight of our engagement activities, we organized a series of                             synthetic biology events in the Balkan Peninsula.
