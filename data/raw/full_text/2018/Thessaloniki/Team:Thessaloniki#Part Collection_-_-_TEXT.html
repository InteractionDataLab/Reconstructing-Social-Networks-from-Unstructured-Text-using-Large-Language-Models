We submitted a library of well-characterized parts that can be utilized by                     the synthetic biology community to render complex genetic networks more                     robust and able to maintain functionality over a wider range of conditions.                     Our toolbox consists of 2 mechanisms of promoter stabilization that achieve                     copy number-independent gene expression, each with its unique                     characteristics and potential applications. In addition, to allow for on                     the fly control of protein expression, we have introduced a theophylline                     riboswitch that controls the translation rate of the downstream Open                     Reading Frame.
