Public Engagement
As a project competing in the foundational advance track, we faced                     difficulties in our efforts to properly communicate our work. We contacted                     Asterios Arampatzis, Team Leader of iGEM Greece 2017, in order to gain some                     insight about the problems they may have met and dealt with, regarding the                     communication of Synthetic Biology and their project to the world. He                     shared with us his experience, stating that synthetic biology is nearly                     absent from our country, as the public has not been properly informed and                     there are not many researchers in the field.
This year, we wanted to make sure that the iGEM Foundation, and synthetic                     biology in general, would come in attention of a larger audience. We aimed                     to inform people of various ages, scientific backgrounds and nationalities                     about this new and exciting, yet relatively unknown in our country,                     scientific field, raise awareness about genetic engineering, discuss about                     the important ethical issues that come up with synthetic biology’s constant                     growth and receive valuable feedback for our project’s application and                     importance to the world.
We organized numerous activities, differentiating our approach depending on                     the audience. In order to familiarize them with synthetic biology we                     presented several iGEM projects from previous years that we believed,                     demonstrate that synthetic biology can prove beneficial in real world                     problems. We, also, wanted to communicate our project, so wee could gain                     some feedback and understand the public’s reception of it.
Finally, taking into consideration public’s feedback, we wanted to address                     the issue of science communication to the public. So, the highlight of                         our                         activities this year was the organization of the “SynBalkans                         Tour”, an                     educational effort in order to broaden the knowledge about synthetic                     biology in the Balkan Region, considering the different cultural and                     scientific background of the audience.
Motivation
The highlight of our public engagement efforts was the                                     organization of the “SynBalkans Tour”, a series of                                     events                                     dedicated to science communication across the Balkan                                     region.                                     Through this tour, our goal was to form a lasting                                         scientific cooperation between institutes in the Balkan Peninsula and                                     provide students with the opportunity to get acquainted                                     with a                                     novel scientific branch, synthetic biology.
Before the event
Before going on tour, we wanted to make sure that we would                                     be                                     able to engage people with different cultural and                                     scientific                                     backgrounds. We came in contact with professors and                                     students                                     from the Department of Balkan Slavic and Oriental                                         Studies,                                         University of Macedonia. We learned about the cultural                                         differences between Balkan countries, so that we                                     could                                     differentiate our approach in each country, always taking                                     into                                     consideration their respective cultural and religious                                     beliefs.
Apart from cultural differences we, also, had to take into                                     account the different scientific background of the                                     people going                                     to attend our event, as synthetic biology is characterized                                     by                                     interdisciplinarity. For this reason, we chose to                                     differentiate                                     the content of our presentation, discussing about synthetic                                     biology applications that are closer to the participants’                                     academic interests.
Along with our project, we used exemples from last year’s                                     iGEM                                     Competition in order to give a good example of synthetic                                     biological                                     circuit utilization.

Our Events:
In 5 days, we visited 4 universities in 3 different                                     countries: University of Belgrade and University of Novi Sad (Serbia), University of Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina), University                                         of                                         Split (Croatia).
Students with an academic background in agriculture were                                     especially eager to know how genetically engineered                                     organisms                                     can be used for environmental purposes without posing                                     serious                                     threats to ecosystems. We discussed about the                                     implementation of                                     kill switches in genetically modified organisms and the                                     safety                                     checkpoints that such engineered systems should feature.
University of Belgrade - Faculty of Biology
University of Novi Sad - School of Agriculture
University of Sarajevo - Faculty of Agriculture and                                         Food                                         Sciences
University of Split - School of Biology and Chemistry
We prepared a short presentation that introduced the                                     audience in the principles and basic tools of Synthetic                                     Biology. First, we introduced our team to the                                     audience.                                     Next, we explained the principles of synthetic biology and                                     mentioned some of its applications (i.e. quorum                                     sensing,                                     metabolic engineering, biosensors). Then, we presented our                                     project, Galene, as well as projects of previous                                     years’                                     iGEM Teams to demonstrate the use of synthetic biology. The                                     projects used in each presentation were selected depending                                     on the participants field of study. Since bioethics and security have to be seriously considered during a                                     project’s                                     design and execution, we highlighted the efforts of the                                     aforementioned projects to address these issues.
After we wrapped up our presentation, we discussed with                                     students and professors about synthetic biology and the                                     iGEM Competition. Students showed interest in learning more                                     about the engineering principles of synthetic biology. We                                     were happy to elaborate on the use of logic gates and                                     explain them terms such as orthogonality and robustness.
Survey
Finally, students were asked to complete a short                                     questionnaire. Here are the results:
Reception
All professors welcomed the idea of organizing a second visit in the balkan region, where we would have the opportunity to interact with students through synthetic biology workshops.
Dr Jasna Puizina, University of Split, told us that she was impressed that undergraduate students were involved in such a contemporary branch of science. She wanted to learn more about the iGEM Competition and shared with us her interest about the formation of an interbalkan iGEM team. She concluded that she will initiate discussions so that synthetic biology courses will be added in the faculty’s curriculum.
We also had a discussion with Dr Alen Mujcinovic, University of Sarajevo, as he was interested in the entrepreneurship side of iGEM and synthetic biology’s applications in agriculture. He thought that involvement in the iGEM Competition would be a great opportunity for students of the faculty.
Conclusion
As this was our first time presenting in front of such a large audience in English, we believe that this experience will prove very useful to us. We managed to communicate our work to people of other nationalities and interacted with numerous researchers in the Balkan region receiving their comments about our work.
Students participating in our event got to know a lot about Synthetic Biology and, through examples & discussion, understood how synthetic biological circuits can be used in real-world applications.
We have already made plans to continue our activities in the Balkan region, with the organization of interactive workshops and presentations.

Athens - 4/6/2018
We believe that workshops is a great way to                                                 introduce someone to a specific scientific                                                 branch. An interactive approach gives the                                                 individual the opportunity to to be more                                                 involved in the learning process, promoting not                                                 only knowledge, but creativity as well. So,in                                                 collaboration with iGEM Athens and Dr.                                                 Konstantinos Vavitsas, from the Australian                                                 Institute for Bioengineering and                                                 Nanotechnology, University of Queensland, we                                                 organised the first Synthetic Biology workshop                                                 (SymBio) in Greece. The SynBio Workshop took                                                 place at the event hall of National Technical                                                 University of Athens. The participants had very                                                 different scientific backgrounds, from medicine                                                 to chemical engineering.
After speeches from Dr K. Vavitsas (An                                                 Introduction to Synthetic Biology) and                                                 Professor Emeritus Fr. Kolisis (Systems and                                                 Synthetic Biotechnology), iGEM Thessaloniki,                                                 iGEM Athens and iGEM Greece (2017) presented                                                 their projects to the audience. When the                                                 presentations were over, Yvoni (iGEM                                                 Thessaloniki) and Giannis (iGEM Athens) spoke                                                 about the applications of engineering                                                 principles in synthetic biology and explained                                                 the use of some basic synthetic biology tools                                                 (e.g. toggle switch, oscillator, riboswitch) in                                                 order for the participants to be able to use                                                 them in their brainstorming sessions. Leda                                                 (iGEM Athens) talked about the safety                                                 precautions and evaluation process that a                                                 project should pass in order to be considered                                                 safe.
The students were then divided into subgroups                                                 and participated in a brainstorming session in                                                 order to solve real world problems using synthetic biology circuits, with help from                                                 members of iGEM teams. Finally, they managed to                                                 come up with innovative ways to tackle problems                                                 such as wound healing, forest restoration and                                                 infant food allergies. In the end, the                                                 participants presented the ideas they had come                                                 up with and before leaving they were asked to                                                 fill in a short questionnaire regarding their                                                 experience in the workshop.
Thessaloniki - 26/5/2018
Students of the faculty of Pharmacy, AUTH,                                                 invited us to the Pharmacology Club where we                                                 gave a speech about Synthetic Biology and its                                                 contribution in Health Sciences and                                                 Pharmacology. We spoke to them about the                                                 production of artemisinin, an antimalarial                                                 pharmaceutical compound, from yeast and                                                 explained the advantages of this method of                                                 production compared to the traditional                                                 isolation of artemisinin from the                                                 pharmaceutical plant. We, also, gave them                                                 examples of iGEM Projects in the diagnostics                                                 and therapeutics tracks. Specifically, we presented the pANDORA (iGEM Greece 2017,                                                 therapeutics), CATE (ETH Zurich 2017,                                                 therapeutics) and Gotta Detect’ Em All                                                 (INSA-Lyon 2016, diagnostics) projects and                                                 after that we had an in depth conversation with                                                 the students about the synthetic biology                                                 circuits used in the aforementioned projects,                                                 as well as the safety concerns they took into                                                 consideration. We enjoyed interacting with                                                 students that are eager to learn about science                                                 beyond the classroom, gaining insight in the                                                 measures that have to be taken for the                                                 appropriate management of the safety risks of                                                 drugs during their development phase and                                                 post-marketing phase.

We visited Zarifeios Akadimia, a primary school                                                 in Alexandroupoli, in order to spark the                                                 students’ interest for science and introduce                                                 them to the concept of synthetic biology. As we                                                 wanted to actively include them in our                                                 activity, we used candy as an example of DNA’s                                                 structure and characteristics to construct an                                                 edible DNA helix. Different color candy standed                                                 for different nitrogenous bases, representing                                                 how complementarity works in the DNA. Each                                                 student built a different “DNA sequence” by                                                 selecting different colored candy. This is how                                                 we managed to explain that, in synthetic                                                 biology, scientists can design their own DNA                                                 sequences in order to achieve the desired                                                 result. In addition, the students, with our                                                 assistance, isolated DNA from bananas. This                                                 way, we displayed that the DNA is not an                                                 abstract concept, but it is a molecule of vital                                                 importance that exists in every living                                                 organism.
Alexandroupoli - 3/3/2018
Student-Run Biology Workshop (SRBW) is a                                                 congress organized by students of the                                                 Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics                                                 from the Democritus University of Thrace,                                                 taking place in Alexandroupoli. The goal of the                                                 congress is to bring students from all over the                                                 country together, so that they can meet with                                                 colleagues from different universities, get                                                 hands-on experience and create presentations                                                 and talks about interesting scientific topics.                                                 So, we thought that the 3rd SRBW was an                                                 excellent chance for us to introduce Synthetic                                                 Biology to a crowd full of future scientists.                                                 We gave a speech about Synthetic Biology, its                                                 origins, tools and its vast number of applications.
Larisa - 3/3/2018
At the high school level, we came in contact                                                 with two major educational institutions,                                                 “Eniaio Ekpaideutiko Kentron” and “Frontistirio                                                 Agrafiotis”. The owners and professors showed                                                 interest in our project and we wanted to make                                                 sure that the students could learn about an                                                 interdisciplinary branch of science, synthetic                                                 biology, as well as understand our project.                                                 Even though we came in with high hopes, we                                                 could not have imagined the amount of questions                                                 and excitement that the students shown. During                                                 our presentation, we explained them the basics                                                 of synthetic biology by showing them exemplary                                                 projects as well as the project we were                                                 designing.
In our country, the final years of high school                                                 tend to be very stressful and taxing for                                                 students [1]. The PanHellenic exams are very                                                 competitive and, on top of that, students                                                 confront the difficult task of deciding their                                                 school of preference/ preferred field of study/                                                 career orientation in such a young age. We, as                                                 an iGEM Team, are characterised by                                                 interdisciplinarity and many of us could not                                                 ever imagine that we would be involved in the                                                 design of a biological system in an                                                 undergraduate level. So, we made an effort to                                                 highlight that interdisciplinarity [2] is one                                                 of the main characteristics of modern academia                                                 and industry, as well as that there are a lot                                                 of opportunities to evolve and get into novel                                                 scientific branches, such as Synthetic Biology.                                                 Therefore, we believe that our interaction with                                                 the students gave them the chance to learn                                                 about contemporary science beyond school books.                                                 In addition, we gave them examples proving that                                                 their chosen field of study is not confining                                                 and, through interdisciplinarity, they can                                                 pursue their goals and get involved in exciting                                                 projects and activities. We were thankful to                                                 have the chance to promote science in such an                                                 interactive way, and have made plans to further                                                 extend our outreach after the competition.
