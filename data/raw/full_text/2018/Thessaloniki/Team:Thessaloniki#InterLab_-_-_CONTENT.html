                    Our Team participated in iGEMs fifth Interlaboratory Study, a study
                    organized by IGEM Measurement Committee in order to identify and correct
                    the sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology measurements, so
                    that eventually, measurements that are taken in different labs will be no
                    more variable than measurements taken within the same lab. This year’s
                    InterLab study aims to establish a GFP measurement protocol based on
                    engineering principles that anyone with a plate reader can use in their lab
                    and normalize fluorescence measurements to absolute cell count or colony
                    forming units (CFUs).
                </P><P>
                    To begin with our experiments we needed a plate reader that is qualified to
                    measure GFP fluorescence and OD600. In our city, there was no such an
                    instrument so we travelled to Alexandroupoli, at the Democritus University
                    of Thrace, where we used the Perkin Elmer EnSpine Multimode Plate Reader.
                    For all of the callibration protocols and cell measurements we adjusted the
                    exitation and emission settings to 485nm and 520nm respectively, the number
                    of flashes used was 10 and black plates with clear flat bottom were used.
                </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row justify-center q-mb-md"><DIV class="q-pa-md col-xs-12 col-sm-11 col-md-10 col-lg-8"><H3>Calibration Protocols:</H3><P>
                    Before starting the plate reader measurements , we obtained the OD600
                    reference point, the particle standard curve and then the fluorescein
                    standard curve.
                </P><P>
                    The OD600 reference point was calculated by using LUDOX CL-X suspension to
                    obtain a conversion factor to transform Absorbance (Abs600) data from the
                    plate reader into a comparable OD600 measurements that would be obtained in
                    a spectrophotometer.
                </P><P>
                    Then, we obtained the particle standard curve by preparing a dilution
                    series of mono disperse silica microspheres and measuring the Abs600 in the
                    plate reader.

                    The last calibration protocol was conducted to generate the fluorescence
                    standard curve by preparing a dilution series of fluorescein and then
                    measuring the fluorescence in the plate reader. Fluorescein is a small
                    molecule which has similar excitation and emission properties to GFP, but
                    also cost effective and easy to handle.
                </P><P>
                    The standard curve slopes showed a somewhat polynomial shape although they
                    were supposed to have a 1:1 slope. This could be due to a consistent
                    pipetting error or because of the over saturation of the detector.

                    Each one of the 6 test devices has a different Anderson promoter. So, we
                    are expecting different fluorescence levels for each device depending on
                    the Anderson promoter used.

                    Transformation of 8 test devices into competent DH5α cells:
                </H5><P>
                    All the plasmids were successfully transformed into DH5a chemically
                    competent cells and resulted in a sufficient amount of colonies on all
                    plates. Then, two colonies from each plate were picked and inoculated
                    overnight (14-16 hours) at 37°C and 220 rpm.

                    Fluorescence and OD600 Measurement for the Transformed Parts:

                    The OD600 and the fluorescence of the transformed cells were measured
                    according to the protocol after 0 and 6 hours. Measurements of both of
                    these time points gave us the following data

                    Discussion:
                </H5><P>
                    Devices 1 and 5 did not grow until the 6 hour timepoint, so the resulted
                    fluorescence is not representative of the promoters strenght. In addition,
                    Device 4, which had the strongest Anderson Promoter, did not grow as much
                    as the other Devices but still the Fluorescence was high. All the other
                    devices grew normally and the results we aqcuired were the ones expected.
                    Conclusively, we completed our Cell Measurement Protocol with success.

                    The Transformations were performed on Frozen Competent DH5α cells (7/12).
                    The CFU process (dilutions and plating) took place on 14th of July. The
                    next day colonies were counted. All protocols followed were provided by
                    iGEM.
