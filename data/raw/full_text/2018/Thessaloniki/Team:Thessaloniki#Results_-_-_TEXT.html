Overview
This year, we aimed to create a toolbox of stabilized promoter systems that                     allows for constant gene expression, independent of gene/plasmid copy                     number. In order to achieve that, we designed two different stabilization                     systems, utilizing TAL Effectors and CRISPR interference. To allow for                     control over gene expression, we introduced a theophylline riboswitch that,                     when induced with different concentrations of theophylline, achieves                     further control over stabilized gene expression at the desired level. This                     page contains all the results we obtained, the conclusions we arrived at,                     the debugging we performed, as well as our future plans.
All measurements were performed in biological replicates (n=3), as a chassis                     we used DH5a E. coli cells, maintained at mid-log phase and as reporter, we                     measured sfGFP fluorescence intensity (ex. 488nm).

In order to investigate the function of TALEsp1-Pupsp1 stabilized                         promoter ( BBa_K2839000 ) and TALEsp2-Pupsp2                         stabilized promoter ( BBa_K2839014 ) we                     measured their fluorescence, as well as the fluorescence of a constitutive                         promoter across 3 plasmids with different Origins of Replication                     (psc101,                     p15A, pUC19-derived pMB1). For the sfGFP fluorescence intensity                     measurements, flow cytometry was our primary measuring method, while a                     plate reader was also used.

Error bars represent                         standard deviation from three biological replicates.

Error bars represent                         standard deviation from three biological replicates.
The results demonstrate that sfGFP expression level, under the control of TALEsp1-Pupsp1 stabilized promoter ( ) and TALEsp2-Pupsp2                         stabilized promoter ( BBa_K2839014 ),                     remains stable when expressed from                     vectors with different copy number. Whereas, sfGFP expression driven from a non stabilized constitutive promoter changes when different copy number                     plasmids are used for its expression.                     Flow cytometry and plate reader data both point towards the decoupling of                     sfGFP expression from the plasmid copy number.                     Unexpected behaviour was seemingly observed by the constitutive promoter in                     the flow cytometry assay. A possible cause might be cross-sample                     contamination.
CRISPRi stabilized promoter
In order to investigate the function of the CRISPRi stabilized promoter                     (BBa_K2839016), we measured its fluorescence outut, as well as a                     constitutive promoter’s fluorescence across 2 plasmids with different                     Origins of Replication (psc101, pUC19-derived pMB1). dCas9 driven by the                     PTet promoter (BBa_R0040), is expressed from a pSB3K3 vector (p15A ori),                     co-transformed in the cells measured.
In order to prevent any growth rate reduction effects due to the                     over-expression of dCas9 and ensure that it is expressed at a high enough                     level so as to allow a wide range of copy number independence, the Optical                     Density at 600nm of cells expressing dCas9 at different inducer                     (doxycycline) concentrations was plotted over the concentration used 6                     hours after induction (Figure 3). The desired level of expression was                     determined to be achieved between 0.8 and 1.2 ng/ml of inducer. These 2                     concentrations are later used to induce the expression of dCas9 in all                     experiments.
Figure 3. Cell growth inhibition caused by                         different expression levels of dCas9, induced by different                         concentrations of doxycycline.
From figure 3, it is clear that cells viability start to significantly                     decline after adding doxycycline to a final concentration of 1.2 ng/ml.
Different Copy number Measurements.
The dcas9 cassette is located on a standard pSB3K3 vector (p15A ori)                         and                         it’s expression, driven by tet repressible promoter, is remained                         constant                         upon the addition of two different concentrations of doxycycline (0.8                         ng/ml, 1.2 ng/ml). We inserted CRISPRi stabilized J23104 promoter ( BBa_K2839016 )                     into plasmids                     with different Origins of Replication (psc101, pUC19-derived pMB1). In                     order to investigate their stabilization effect on sfGFP expression across                     different copy numbers we measured fluorescence, using sfGFP as a marker.                     For the sfGFP fluorescence intensity measurements, we conducted flow                     cytometry analysis.

CRISPRi stabilized promoter and non stabilized                         constitutive pT7A1w1 promoter flow cytometry fluorescence measurements                         at two different copy numbers. Error bars represent standard deviation                         from three biological replicates.
Stabilization of the BBa_J23104 Anderson promoter was successful, as seen in Figures 5 and 6.
Figure 5. Time assays of CRISPRi stabilized promoter at different dCas9                         induction levels and copy numbers. Flow cytometry measurements were                         performed at 1.5, 3.5 and 7.5 hours post-induction with doxycycline.
From figure 4 it is clear that sfGFP expression level, under the control of CRISPRi stabilized J23104 promoter ( BBa_K2839016 )                     with dCas9 levels induced                     by 0.8 or 1.2 ng/ml doxycycline, remains stable when expressed from                     different vectors, whereas, without dCas9 expression, sfGFP expression                     level changes when different copy number plasmids are used for its                     expression.
Higher induction level of dCas9 results in lower stabilization Error and                     lower expression. This shows that dCas9 expression partially determines the                     repression strength, even at seemingly not saturated levels of expression.                     Stabilization Error (E) for 0.8ng/ml Doxycycline induction was calculated                     to be approximately 0.275 and for 1.2ng/ml, approximately 0.106.                     Stabilization Error was calculated as the relative change in GOI expression                     as the copy number increases from a minimum copy number (Cmin) to infinity                     (approximately equal to the expression level at the copy number of                     pUC19-derived pMB1. This may point towards the ability of CRISPR stabilized                     promoters to be tuned to the desired stabilization error-relative strength                     level by changing the expression level of dCas9.                     Lower expression levels at higher dCas9 expression levels may be explained                     as a result of growth rate reduction and cell morphology changes from dCas9                     overexpression.
Riboswitches
Aiming to incorporate translational control to our promoters we introduced                     two Theophylline responsive Riboswitches which we thoroughly characterized.                     As a reporter, we chose sfGFP fused with the first 99 nucleotides of                     luciferase to avoid possible changes in the secondary structure of the                     aptamer caused by sfGFP.                     The riboswitches’ characterization devices, BBa_K2839002 , BBa_K2839006 ,                     were inserted into pSB1C3 vector. For the sfGFP fluorescence intensity                     measurements we used flow cytometry.
Figure 6. Theo27 response to differential induction by theophylline.                         Fluorescence was measured 7 hours after initial induction with                         theophylline.
The results prove that both riboswitches reacted to theophylline,                     facilitating inducible expression of sfGFP. Specifically, sfGFP activity                     increased in direct proportion to the concentration of the ligand.

12.1 Riboswitch does not respond to theophylline when driving sfGFP                     expression, but retains functionality upon fusion of the sfGFP with the                     first 99 nucleotides of the luciferase protein, after the start codon.
FIgure 8. TALE stabilized promoter with translational control.                         Induction of the TALE stabilized promoter driving sfGFP expression                         under the regulation of the 12.1 theophylline riboswitch. (n=3).
The proper function of the 12.1 riboswitch under TALE promoter                     stabilization proves that the two systems, are, as expected (link design),                     orthogonal to each other. The drop in expression at 8mM theophylline, can                     be credited to the negative effects on growth that high theophylline                     concentrations (>5mM) exhibit.
From figures 7 and 8, it is evident that the 12.1 theophylline riboswitch                     driving sfGFP fusion protein, displays better activation ratio than Theo27                     theophylline responsive riboswitch. Therefore, we incorporated it                     downstream of the TALEsp1-Pupsp1 stabilized promoter, achieving on the                         fly                         inducibility.
Conclusions
We characterized two TALE stabilized promoter variants, and                                 proved their expected function.
We designed and successfully implemented a CRISPRi stabilized                                 promoter and confirmed that CRISPRi has the potential to                                 stabilize promoters over a wide range of plasmid copy numbers                                 for different dCas9 expression levels.
Stabilized promoters do not interfere with the function of                                 downstream riboswitches.
Successfully controlled stabilized gene expression with                                 theophylline responsive aptamer.
Restoration of functionality of a non functional part when                                 driving a common reporter (sfGFP), by fusing it with the 99                                 nucleotides of a different one.
We characterized 3 riboswitches.
What we unfortunately did not achieve
Even though we successfully cloned a heterologous AND gate and                                 its stabilized variant into different plasmid backbones, we                                 didn’t manage to properly characterize their functionality and                                 behaviour over a range of different copy numbers.
We didn’t succeed in plotting a CRISPRisp response function to                                 determine the cooperativity of repression and gain further                                 insight into the behaviour of this system.
We did not manage to characterize a RNA-based iFFL stabilized                                 promoter utilizing a transcriptional attenuator, due to time                                 constraints.
Future Experiments
Properly stabilize and prove the improvement of the heterologous                                 AND-gate.
Better characterize CRISPRi stabilized promoters over more copy                                 numbers and in different E. coli strains.
Achieve promoter stabilization via the use of a transcriptional                                 attenuator.
