                    In light of this year’s Interlab study, we wanted to further assist this
                    initiative by conducting an Interlab study of our own by measuring the
                    constructs we have designed. We wanted to investigate whether stabilized
                    promoters would reduce variability in interlaboratory fluorescence
                    measurements exhibited by engineered genetic constructs across different
                    laboratories. (Jake et al.)
                </P><P>
                    Fluctuations observed in plasmid copy number are caused by small changes in
                    the cell’s environment as well as the cell itself. For example, differences
                    in growth temperature and growth medium composition affect the copy number
                    of plasmids. Such variations may be more apparent between labs (e.g.
                    differences in lab equipment, handling), becoming a major hindrance in
                    scientific research.
                </P><P>
                    The measurement protocol was the same as the one performed for the plate
                    reader measurements in this years interlab study. There were 4 Test
                    Devices:
                    <UL><LI>TD1 and TD2 contained pupsp1 and pupsp2, two constitutive promoters
                            .</LI><LI>TD3 and TD4 contained TALEsp1 stabilized pupsp1 and TALEsp2
                            stabilized pupsp2 promoters.</LI></UL></P><P>
                    Due to the fact that the teams that took part in our Interlaboratory
                    Measurement had, also, participated in the iGEM Interlaboratory
                    Measurement, so they provided us with the interlab negative control and
                    calibration data.

                        Unfortunately due to time constraints we could not ask teams to repeat measurements that were affected from oversaturation. Still, we want to thank iGEM Marburg, iGEM Imperial, iGEM Rice and iGEM Gifu for their participation in our interlab collab.

                    degrees, at various time points. The growth curve was used to examine the
                    growth of V. natriegens.

                        Athens</A>, we organized the first Synthetic Biology
                    workshop in Greece. The “SynBio Workshop” took place in Athens, in the 5th
                    of July. Students from various backgrounds, such as medicine, engineering
                    and mathematics, had the opportunity to participate in a hands-on workshop,
                    designing creative solutions to real life problems using synthetic biology
                    principles, with the help of iGEM Thessaloniki and iGEM Athens members. For
