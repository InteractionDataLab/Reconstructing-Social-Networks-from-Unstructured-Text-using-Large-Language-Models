March 2018
We presented our project idea to our Primary Investigators and Professors                     of our Faculties. During this time period we focused our brainstorming                     sessions on the enrichment of our project, we enlisted the materials needed                     for the laboratory work and we began to develop our experimental workflow.
June 2018
During our first weeks in the lab we received Safety and Security                         training by various members of the labs we worked in. We were taught                         proper lab practice, sterile techniques and physical biosecurity, along                         with proper waste disposal and emergency procedures. We were instructed                         on the function and usage of the various equipment in the lab like                         Biosafety Cabinets, centrifuges and more.
General Laboratory Procedures
Equipment Use
Emergency response procedures
Prevention and control of laboratory contaminations
Handling of hazardous reagents
Disposal of Buffers and Chemicals
Setting up the Lab This week we focused on gathering the material and                     equipment needed for our laboratory work. We prepared solutions, agar                     plates, Bacterial Growth Medium and a small batch of DH5a competent cells.                     We also resuspended the parts we needed from the iGEM 2018 distribution                     kit.
July 2018
Wet Lab-Dry Lab meetings focused on Human Practices
This week we continued setting up the lab and gathering the materials                     needed for our experiments. We, also, conducted the Interlaboratory                     Measurement Study.
The pThSSe_59, pThSSe_60 plasmids from Addgene and our first gBlocks                     arrived. We focused on cloning the Talesp1 and Talesp2 stabilized cassette                     in backbones with different ORIs and prepared the constructs for Flow                     Cytometry.
August 2018
We successfully removed the two illegal PStI sited inside the pTHSSe_59 and                     pTHSSe_60 plasmids.
We got our first results for the TAL Effector Stabilization system.
We focused on the design of our CRISPRi stabilization system.
This week we successfully cloned our Riboswitch Constructs and got our                     first Flow Cytometry data. We, also, successfully cloned our Theophylline                     Riboswitch in the Tale Stabilised cassette.
After a constructive wet-dry meeting we decided to go a step further and                     design a RNA level control system. Together with the dry lab we simulated                     different topologies and chose the one better suited for our system.
September 2018
This Week we started working on our AND Gate Constructs.
Our Interlaboratory Measurement Collab has started. We prepared and                     measured the samples to be sent to the other iGEM Teams.
The pAN-PTet-dCas9 plasmid arrived and we started working on our CRISRi                     stabilization system. The AND Gate gBlocks arrived.
We received our sequencing results
We conducted the flow cytometry measurements for our constructs and                     analyzed the results.
