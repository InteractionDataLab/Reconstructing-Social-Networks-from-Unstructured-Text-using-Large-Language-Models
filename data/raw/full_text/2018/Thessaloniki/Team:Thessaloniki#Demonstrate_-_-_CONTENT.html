                    The ultimate goal of our project was the design of stabilized promoters
                    that achieve constant gene expression regardless of their genetic context.
                    We created a functional toolbox that enhances stability and robustness of
                    synthetic biological systems by decoupling gene expression from copy
                    number.

                    We demonstrate that our project worked as expected by achieving gene
                    expression decoupled from copy number.

                    remains stable when expressed from
                    vectors with different copy number. Whereas, sfGFP expression driven from a

                    plasmids are used for its expression.

                    Expanding our system, we implemented a theophylline responsive riboswitch
