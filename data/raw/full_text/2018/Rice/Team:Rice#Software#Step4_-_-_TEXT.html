Second Energy Constraint Details
Calculate binding energies for all pairs and select pairs with binding energies within 0.5 kcal/mol of WT ASD/SD.
Function: narrow_crossbinding
This function again determines the wild type ASD and SD sequences for an organism. It then determines the binding energies between all of the candidate ASD sequences and the wild-type SD sequence. Those candidates with binding energies less than -1 kcal/mol are discarded, because this means that the orthogonal ribosomes produced using those ASD sequences are more likely to bind with the host’s SD sequence, and therefore not orthogonal in nature. The concept is illustrated in figure 5 below.
