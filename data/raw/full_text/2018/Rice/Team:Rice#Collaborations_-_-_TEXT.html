Collaborations
University of Texas at Austin
With UT Austin iGEM, we worked closely seeing as our teams shared common goals focusing on the field of foundational advancement. This lead to a collaboration based on an exchange of ideas as well as constructs between our teams. In our collaboration, we organized various team Skype conferences, created a collaborative GroupMe, and met in person to exchange parts and ideas. We received promoter-containing constructs from the UT Austin iGEM team, which we then transformed, plated, and miniprepped. By testing these origins from their kit, we were able to provide an extra layer of scrutiny over the parts in their project.

Thessaloniki
With Thessaloniki iGEM, we participated in their interlab collaboration by providing calibration data and negative control measurement data following their fluorescent measurement protocol. The data generated assisted Thessaloniki in determining whether they have achieved plasmid copy number-independent expression of GFP, one of the main goals of their project.
LASA
With LASA iGEM, we helped their team develop ideas to improve the modeling portion of their project. Due to their limited resources and experience as a high school team, we hoped the LASA team could further their modeling skills, not only for this project, but also for projects in the future.
Cornell University
With Cornell iGEM, we aided one another through an exchange of ideas and feedback as we both worked toward a foundational advance. Although we were not able to meet in person, we maintained steady communication through email and conference calls. We received an education outreach learning kit from the Cornell team; we tested it by introducing synthetic biology to the general public using their kit. After these sessions we received feedback from the participants and forwarded it to Cornell, with additional comments from our team.
