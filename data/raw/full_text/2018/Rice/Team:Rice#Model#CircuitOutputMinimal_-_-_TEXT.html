Physiological Output
Overview
The base model includes expression of a circuit gene, with translation by either host ribosomes or orthogonal ribosomes. Since our circuits have fluorescent reporter proteins, we should be able to correlate circuit expression levels in the model with fluorescence levels from wet lab data.
Explanation
Circuit proteins includes both mCherry and the tetR repressor proteins. We simulate the creation of these molecules just like we simulate other host proteins, adding equations for their mRNAs (mC), ribosomal complexes (cC), and the actual proteins pC. The number of circuit proteins in the cell provides a good measure of the expected fluorescence of the cells.
