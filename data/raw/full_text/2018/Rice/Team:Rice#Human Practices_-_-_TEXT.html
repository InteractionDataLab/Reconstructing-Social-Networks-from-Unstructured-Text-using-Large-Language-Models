Human Practices Overview
Our Goal
As part of human practices, the Rice iGEM 2018 team focused on two main areas: community engagement and educational outreach, as well as collaboration with other iGEM teams. Our project aims to spread knowledge of synthetic biology and engineering non-model organisms, making these topics more accessible to the general audience.
