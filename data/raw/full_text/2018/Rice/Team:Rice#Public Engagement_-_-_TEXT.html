iGEM in the Community
Over the summer, our team presented to local high schools in the greater Houston area, discussing our project and the iGEM competition overall. We also shared tips on college applications, majoring in STEM, and getting started in STEM research in general.
Among our larger presentations were the presentations to: the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Rice, the Bioethics Debate program at Rice, and students in the School of Science and Technology (SST).

Rice iGEM presents at the School of Science and Technology. We were able to guide the students through the iGEM competition requirements, thus providing them the support they will need to grow into a successful high school iGEM team.
Another aspect of our community outreach involves the distribution of our bacteria buttons and project brochures at Rice. These items are a fun way to spread knowledge of iGEM and to get more people involved in our project. Through our buttons and brochures we can quickly and effectively make our project more accessible to a general audience.

Program Proposal for K-12 and the General Public
The Rice iGEM team created a three-tier program for teaching introductory synthetic biology to elementary schools, high schools, and the general public. The program will provide participants an opportunity to learn about engineering non-model organisms, our project, and policy surrounding genetic engineering through various activities catered to their age group.
