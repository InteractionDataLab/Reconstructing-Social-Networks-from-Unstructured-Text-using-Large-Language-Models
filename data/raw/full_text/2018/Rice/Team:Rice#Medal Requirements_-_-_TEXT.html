Characterization / Contribution
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Our project has been documented on our wiki and we look forward to presenting our team poster and presentation at the Giant Jamboree. Our safety and judging forms have been submitted. Our parts pages are completed and we submitted a sample to the registry.
Please refer to our attributions , where we list the contributions of those who have made Rice iGEM possible.
This cycle, we participated in the Interlab Measurement Study. Check out our results!

Human Practices
We submitted and characterized our Universal Bacterial Expression Resource (UBER)  plasmid .
We both contributed to and benefited from collaborations with local and international iGEM teams!
We engaged and educated others about our specific project and wider issues in synthetic biology.

Integrated Human Practices
We have successfully characterized five broad host range regulatory elements, assembled and tested an improved orthogonal transcription system, and demonstrated the performance of orthogonal ribosomes designed using our software.
We developed a model of orthogonal expression that sheds light on how orthogonal expression systems function and allows us to design better orthogonal expression plasmids.
We developed a program designed to teach the general public about synthetic biology. Through the program we can obtain feedback about genetic engineering public concern, which would then be integrated into our project. We engaged experts in industry and government and obtained feedback which was integrated into our project design.
