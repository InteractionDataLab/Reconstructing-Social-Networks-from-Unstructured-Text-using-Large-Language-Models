Metabolism
Overview
Cellular energy is generated via two co-expressed enzymes: a transporter and a metabolic enzyme. We assume that the cells grow in a chemostat with a constant concentration of nutrients. The cells import the nutrients and then convert them to cellular energy.
Details
To convert nutrients into energy, first the cell must import the nutrients from the outside source (se) to the inside (si). The transporter protein (pT) accomplishes this via Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a maximum speed of vT and a import threshold of kT. Conversion to cellular energy is accomplished in a similar manner with the metabolic enzyme (pE) and with constants vE and kE. However, conversion is not perfect, and the efficiency of the conversion is given by the factor φE.  Energy is used during translation at a rate of γ Σci, where the sum runs over all translation complexes (the ci). In addition, the cell slowly grows at a rate of λ = γ (Σci)/Mp, where Mp is the total mass (in amino acids) of the proteome. As a result, all species are diluted with a rate constant of λ.
