BBa_K2540011
Universal bacterial expression resource (UBER)
basic
Universal Bacterial Expression Resource (UBER) is a system containing T7 RNA Polymerase (T7 RNAP) which can be used for the expression of genes under T7 promoter. UBER includes T7 RNAP and TetR repressor which provides negative feedback on the polymerase levels to help reduce toxicity. The part was modified from Kushwaha & Salis.1

Broad host range regulatory elements
basic
Broad host range regulatory elements consist of a constitutive promoter and a ribosome binding site which can be used for gene expression across different bacterial species. The part sequences were obtained from Johns et al.2
BBa_K2540015
Orthogonal ribosome binding site
basic
This orthogonal RBS was designed using RBS calculator for orthogonal 16S rRNA predicted to function across a variety of bacterial strains. Prediction was done by algorithm written by our team based on previous work by Chubiz & Rao.3
