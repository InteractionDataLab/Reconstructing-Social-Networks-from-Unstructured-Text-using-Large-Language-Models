Cells were grown in LB at 30°C for 15 hours. The results demonstrate that all strains are able to grow under those conditions, with <I>E. coli</I> strains and <I>B. subtilis</I> exhibiting the highest growth rates.


</P><DIV class="center caption"><B class="caption">Figure 1: Growth rates of bacteria used in the project</B></DIV><H3> Inhibitory Concentrations of Antibiotics </H3><P> In order to identify the antibiotic concentrations to be used for selection with our strains, we performed titrations with neomycin and kanamycin by spotting cultures on LB agar plates with concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 mg/L. The results show that most strains can be inhibited with &lt; 50 mg/L of kanamycin (Figure 2). The exceptions are <I>S. meliloti</I> which is resistant to kanamycin but can be inhibited with neomycin and <I>B. subtilis</I>, whose growth can be inhibited at 200 mg/L kanamycin or 100 ng/mL kanamycin. We conclude that KanR aph(3′)-II can be used as a broad host range antibiotic resistance cassette in our constructs since it is known to confer resistance to both neomycin and kanamycin. </P><DIV class="center caption"><B class="caption">Figure 2: Identification of inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics for the bacteria used in the project.</B> Growth of most strains is inhibited at 50 mg/L kanamycin. The growth of <I>S. meliloti</I> is inhibited at 50 mg/L neomycin and <I>B. subtilis</I> requires either &gt;100 mg/L neomycin or &gt;200 mg/L kanamycin to prevent growth.

</DIV><H2>Broad Host Range Parts</H2><P> The goal of our project is to create a broad host range system that can be transferred across species without the need for genetic manipulation. To achieve this goal, we had to identify origins of replication and promoters that perform well in a wide variety of strains. We chose three origins of replication pBBR1, RSF1010, and pWV01 known from literature to have broad host range. To test the performance of origins in our bacteria, we transformed a prototypical vector for each origin of replication containing KanR aph(3′)-II antibiotic resistance cassette into all strains. Growth of bacteria on inhibitory concentration of the appropriate antibiotic indicated successful plasmid replication. The results of the experiment are summarized in Figure 3. The results of the experiments for the strains not shown in the table were inconclusive. Based on these results, we chose to use RSF1010 for our broad host range constructs.

</DIV><H3> Regulatory Elements </H3><P>

In addition to the origins of replication, we characterized five broad host range regulatory elements from Johns <I>et al.</I><SUP>1</SUP>, which include a promoter and a ribosome binding site. Johns <I>et al.</I><SUP>1</SUP> created a library of broad host range regulatory elements and characterized them in <I>E. coli</I>, <I>B. subtilis</I>, <I>C. glutamicum</I>, <I>P. aeruginosa</I>, and <I>V. natriegens</I>. In attempt to obtain the elements which result in the most consistent reporter expression levels across strains, we parsed through the data on transcription levels reported in Johns <I>et al.</I> for 240 sequences using <A href="https://2018.igem.org/File:T--Rice--script.m#file" download="">MATLAB script</A>, normalized the values based on maximum and expression levels for each strain and extracted 10 sequences with the  standard deviation &lt; 0.1 which spanned a range of expression levels across the bacteria tested. We constructed cassettes involving mKate2 fluorescent protein under the control of five different regulatory elements (Figure 4). Elements were ranked based on transcription rates documented in Johns <I>et al.</I></P><DIV class="center caption"><B class="caption">Figure 4: broad host range plasmid for mKate2 expression with broad host range regulatory elements.</B> A construct for mKate2 expression with regulatory elements was assembled on a broad host range plasmid with RSF1010 origin to allow for characterization in a range of bacteria.

We transformed the constructs into four <I> E. coli </I> strains (MG1655, BL21, Nissle 1917, and DH10B), <I> P. putida </I>, and <I> S. oneidensis. </I>Fluorescence levels measured after 24 hours of incubation at 30°C demonstrate that broad host range regulatory elements resulted in the same order of magnitude of mKate2 expression across strains, with Strength 8 element demonstrating the lowest variability (Figure 5). <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Rice/Parts"> We submitted broad host range regulatory elements as BioBricks. </A></P><DIV class="center caption"><B class="caption">Figure 5: mKate2 expression with broad host range regulatory elements across strains.</B> mKate2 expression constructs with regulatory elements were transformed into four <I>E. coli</I> strains (MG1655, BL21, Nissle 1917, DH10B), <I> P. putida </I>, and <I>S. oneidensis </I>. Cells were grown in LB and fluorescence measured after 24 hours of incubation. Error bars show +/- 1 s.d. across three replicates.  
</DIV><H2>Orthogonal Transcription</H2><P>
After successfully assembling modified and original UBER<SUP>2</SUP> on plasmids containing RFS1010 origin, we co-transformed <I>E. coli</I> DH10B cells with either original or modified UBER (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2540011">BBa_K2540011 </A>) and an expression cassette containing mKate2 controlled by T7 promoter (Figure 6)  and collected time course fluorescence data over 15 hours at 37°C in LB.

Cells were grown in LB and fluorescence measured after 24 hours of incubation. 
</DIV><P>The results demonstrate that modifications introduced do not interfere with UBER function and result in higher fluorescence/OD compared to the original system. (Figure 7). The absence of fluorescence for negative control samples which did not have T7 RNA polymerase demonstrate that fluorescence levels are due to orthogonal transcription rather than transcription by host polymerase.</P><DIV class="center caption"><B class="caption">Figure 7: Performance of original vs. modified UBER in <I>E. coli</I></B> 
mKate2 expression driven by either original or modified UBER was measured over 15 hours. Modifications introduced do not interfere with UBER function and result in higher fluorescence/OD compared to the original system. Error bars show +/- 1 s.d. across three replicates.  
</DIV><P> Next, we assembled the orthogonal transcription system (UBER and mKate2 expression cassette) on a single plasmid to facilitate cross-species expression (Figure 8).
</P><DIV class="center caption"><B class="caption">Figure 8: UBER (original and modified) and mKate2 expression cassette assembled on a single plasmid</B></DIV><P><I>E. coli</I> DH10B cells containing original UBER and mKate2 had detectable fluorescence (Figure 9). However, no fluorescence over background was measured for the modified UBER. A similar trend was observed for <I>S. oneidensis</I>. The opposite was observed in <I>P. putida</I>: modified UBER resulted in high mKate2 fluorescence while no fluorescence was detected for the original UBER. We suggest that inconsistencies in the expression levels may be due to heterogeneity of cell populations: when cells containing the orthogonal transcription system are plated on LB agar plates, both fluorescence and non-fluorescent colonies are observed. Future work will involve investigating this problem (one potential cause may be recombination within our circuit).

Error bars show +/- 1 s.d. across three replicates.  
</DIV><H2>Orthogonal Translation</H2><P> 

To identify an orthogonal 16S rRNA sequence that is likely to work across most of the strains used in our project, our team applied <A href="“https://2018.igem.org/Team:Rice/Software”">our software</A> to the genomes of <I>E. coli</I>, <I>B. subtilis</I> , <I>L. lactis</I>, <I>P. putida</I>, <I>S. oneidensis</I>, <I>S. meliloti</I>,  and <I>C. glutamicum</I>. The ASD sequence “AUCAGCAGCAUA” was highly ranked for all bacteria except <I>B. subtilis</I>, so we decided to use it to create a “universal” orthogonal ribosome construct. The wild-type <I>E. coli</I> 16S rRNA was mutated to incorporate the altered anti Shine-Dalgarno sequence, and constructs shown in Figure 10 were built to test the function of orthogonal ribosomes in <I>E. coli</I>. 
</P><DIV class="center caption"><B class="caption">Figure 10: constructs used to test orthogonal translation in <I>E. coli</I>.</B> 

Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the oRBS is unable to interact with host ribosome and no fluorescence is observed when o16S rRNA is not present (negative control). When plasmid containing o16S rRNA is introduced, orthogonal ribosomes are created which are able to translate mRNA containing oRBS, resulting in reporter expression. 
</DIV><P>When the construct containing mKate2 with oRBS (orthogonal ribosome binding site <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2540011">BBa_K2540011</A>) was transformed into <I>E. coli</I> MG1655, no fluorescence over background was detected. However, when mKate2 plasmid was co-transformed with a plasmid expressing orthogonal 16S rRNA, a 100~ fold increase of fluorescence compared to negative control was observed (Figure 11). This demonstrates that only orthogonal ribosomes are able to initiate translation of the mKate2 mRNA.</P><DIV class="center caption"><B class="caption">Figure 11: characterization of orthogonal translation constructs in <I>E. coli </I>.</B> 
IPTG-dependent mKate2 fluorescence is observed when plamids containing o16S rRNA controlled by Plac promoter and oRBS-mKate2 are co-transformed into <I>E. coli</I> (left). At 0.1 mM IPTG, ~100 fold fluorescence over negative control is observed, demonstrating that translation is orthogonal (right). Error bars show +/- 1 s.d. across three replicates.  
</DIV><H2>Conclusion</H2><P>
In the course of our project, we performed characterization of broad host range parts to be used in PORTAL. We identified antibiotic resistance cassette, origin of replication, and regulatory elements which can make PORTAL easily transferable across bacteria. In addition, we separately constructed and characterized orthogonal transcription and orthogonal translation components of PORTAL. Our results demonstrate that orthogonal transcription part needs to be further improved to eliminate inconsistencies in expression across bacteria. Orthogonal translation successfully functions in <I>E. coli</I>, with host ribosome unable to initiate translation of mRNA containing the orthogonal RBS. We submitted modified UBER, broad host range regulatory elements, and oRBS as BioBricks. However, we were not able to submit o16S rRNA since it contains an internal EcoRI cut site.
