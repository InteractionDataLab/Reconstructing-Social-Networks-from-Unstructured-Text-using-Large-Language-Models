An enzyme electrode sensor will be a good choice. The electrodes here can convert the biological signals into an electrical signal and transmit  it to a portable instrument for us to use . In our design, by using the curli, gold nanoparticles and Nafion all together, we can amplify and finally collect the catalytic signal of the enzymes through the electrochemical way. In the following, we will explain one by one why every component in this design is necessary and how we use them to construct a well-run biosensor.</P></DIV><DIV class="cnt_psg"><DIV class="psg" style="width: 100% !important;"><UL id="myTab" class="nav nav-tabs"><LI class="active" id="C"><A href="#c" data-toggle="tab">Curli Protocol</A></LI><LI id="IOS"><A href="#ios" data-toggle="tab">Enzyme Electrode Protocol</A></LI><LI id="JAVA"><A href="#java" data-toggle="tab">Fused protein protocol</A></LI></UL><DIV id="myTabContent" class="tab-content"><DIV class="tab-pane fade in active" id="c" style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms' !important;"><SPAN class="psg_ttl">Expression</SPAN><P>We obtained csgA sequence from the genome of E.
