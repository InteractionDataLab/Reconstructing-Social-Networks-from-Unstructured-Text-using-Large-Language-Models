OVERVIEW  
To detect injuries with our cell-free device, we employed three enzymes which commonly used in diagnosis to realize enzyme cascade and logic gate. Meanwhile, we found that SpyTag forms a spontaneous isopeptide bond to SpyCatcher, and SdyTag/SdyCatcher, SnoopTag/SnoopCatcher are the same[1][2][3]. With no cross reaction, three orthogonal tag-catcher pairs link enzymes in order via covalent bond.

We constructed three biobricks of tag-functional protein-catcher complex which can spontaneously assemble via covalent links. The original DNA sequence comes from the references below. To realize RFC10 compatibility and correct expression in high level, we optimized and synthesized the sequence, and mutated some illegal Restriction Enzyme cutting sites through synonymous substitutions.

We utilized SDS-PAGE and Western blot to detect the expression of the three tag-protein-catcher complex. The primary antibody is Mouse-anti-His mAb.

Besides, we used BSA Standard Curve to qualifity . Because the three complex didn' t express out successfully at the same time, so we tested their concentration separately and made BSA Standard Curve for each one.

Table. 1   qualification result of three complex
We suspected that the fusion with Tag/Catcher might lead to enzyme activity decline which had certain influence on our detector. To verify and qualify the enzymes'  activity decline, microplate reader was used. The result shows the effect of Tag-Cather on enzyme activity can' t be underestimated. How to improve the modified enzymes' activity is the focus in our future work.
