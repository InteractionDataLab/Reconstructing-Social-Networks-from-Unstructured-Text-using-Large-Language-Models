PROTOCOLS  
After the construction of the curli matrix and multi-enzyme complex, what we need to do next is to demonstrate the ability of the enzymes in a simple and intuitive way. An enzyme electrode sensor will be a good choice. The electrodes here can convert the biological signals into an electrical signal and transmit  it to a portable instrument for us to use . In our design, by using the curli, gold nanoparticles and Nafion all together, we can amplify and finally collect the catalytic signal of the enzymes through the electrochemical way. In the following, we will explain one by one why every component in this design is necessary and how we use them to construct a well-run biosensor.

Fused protein protocol
Expression
We obtained csgA sequence from the genome of E. Coli MG1655 by PCR and inserted it into Pet26(+). The recombinant plasmid was transfromed into BL21(DE3) and shaken overnight in LB with antibiotics. After reaching an optical density of 0.6~0.8 at 600 nm, the protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 25℃. We centrifuged the solution at 12000 rmp for 15mins, and cell pellets were resuspended gently with lysis buffer followed by sonication at the power of 300w for 30mins. The supernatant after centrifugation was kept for future purification.
Purification and Analysis Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
Dissolve the agarose powder in TAE. Heat it to near-boiling point, cool sufficiently and pour the solution into a cast with a comb. After solidification, set gel tray into cuvette, filled with 1x TAE buffer. Load samples into the walls created by the comb. Run gel at 90-120V for 20-40min. Check image under UV light.
Ni-NTA Affinity Purification
Centrifuge the E. coli Lysates at 12000rmp at 4℃ for 20 minutes. Wash the column with 5ml sterile water, 8 mol/L urea, and sterile water. Add 0.1 mol/L Nickel Sulfate until the column changes from white to blue (Ni). Remove the excess Nickel with sterile water. Balance the column with wash solution. Add supernatant into the Ni-NTA column. Control the flow rate to about 0.5-1ml/min. Collect sample with EP tube.
SDS-PAGE
Gel production:Put two sealed glass plates together and clamp in a stand to make a mold. Mix H2O, 30%(Acr-Bise), gel buffer, SDS, TEMED and 10%APS to make a gel solution. Pour the solution into the mold without creating bubbles, and add water. After the polymerization of the separating gel, the water is discard and add the stacking gel solution which is made similarly.
Sample preparation: Add the sample buffer, and thus SDS in excess to the proteins, and the sample is then heated to 95℃ for five minutes.
Load 15-20 ul supernatant per lane on a protein gel. Load 10 ul prestained protein ladder. Run protein gel at 200V until dye front reaches the bottom of the gel.
Cango Red Assay
As an amyloid protein, we dyed curli by Cango Red to indicate the expression and characteristic of curli. Centrifuge curli pellet at 12,000g for 5 mins. Resuspend gently by LB and add Cango Red to 30μg/ml CR and incubate at RT for 30 mins. Centrifuge at 14,000rpm for 5mins. Set LB with equal CR as the blank. Measure the absorbance of supernatant at 480nm for CR and 600nm for cell concentration. Compare the expression in CsgA knockout Defect bacteria with that of our recombinant recombinant strain.
Enzyme Electrode Protocol Statement
We use enzyme electrode to test enzymes’ activity and related electrodes’ response to substrates.

Dissolve GOD (Glucose oxidase) in PBS (pH=6.8) to 10mg/mL. Add 10μl GOD solution to GCE’s working surface and dry it in 4℃. Add 5μL AuNP solution (disperse 5nm gold nano-particle with water to 5mg/mL) to GCE’s working surface and dry it in 4℃. Later, 5μL nafion (0.5wt% in water) is added in the same way.

Dissolve HRP (horseradish peroxidase) in PBS (pH=6.0) together with NADH (β-Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide disodium salt) and both reach the concentration of 1mg/mL. Add 10μL  HRP solution into GCE’s working surface and dry it in 4℃. Then GCE is modified with AuNP and nafion following same method above. The HRP-GCE is preserved in PBS (pH=6.0) in 4℃.

We use this type of enzyme electrode to demonstrate that our idea about enzyme logic gates (XOR and AND) works.
XOR-GCE
• Modification

Add 5μL 100nM Ni-NTA to GCE’s working face followed by 5μL CsgA solution (the curli part of our project) and 5μL 2% (m/v) glutaraldehyde and 2% (m/v) paraformaldehyde solution. After 2 hours in 4℃, wash the electrode with double distilled water and then dry it in room temperature. GOD-HRP-LDH complex is diluted in PBS (pH=7.0, with 1mg/mL NADH) and reach the concentration of 1mg/mL. Add 20μL of the solution mentioned above to GCE’s working surface and dry it in 4℃. Then modify GCE with AuNP and nafion following the methods above. The XOR-GCE is preserved in PBS (pH=7.0) in 4℃.

Detector - enzyme electrode used to detect one’s injury Statement
We designed an IDE (interdigital electrode, see Figure 1) and a 2D printer to print enzyme complex on it. Also, we made a set of hardware and software to detect and transmit current data. Through this data we can tell whether one is injured.
Modification
Paint Ag/AgCl ink on reference electrode of IDE (red part in Figure 1). Put IDE in oven, keep temperature at 120℃ for 5 minutes and cool it. Stick IDE inside the 2D printer and print Ni-NTA solution, CsgA solution and 2% (m/v) glutaraldehyde and 2% (m/v) paraformaldehyde solution. An hour later, wash the electrode in double distilled water and then dry it in room temperature. Stick IDE inside the 2D printer and print GOD-HRP-LDH complex solution used in XOR-GCE. After air-dry, print GOD-HRP-LDH complex solution again and dry IDE at room temperature. Print AuNP solution followed by air-dry. Print nafion and store IDE at room temperature for 4 days or at 4℃ for longer.
Test
Insert IDE into our hardware, connect it with iPhone through Bluetooth. Add a drop of blood sample on IDE. The current shows whether the patient suffers from abdominal trauma, TBI (traumatic brain injury) or not.
