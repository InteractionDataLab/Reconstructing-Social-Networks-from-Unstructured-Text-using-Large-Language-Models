ATTRIBUTIONS 
Welcome! This year, we designed 23 parts, and all of them have been submitted to the iGEM Registry following  the Biobricks assembly standard as described by RFC10. See more detailed information on our part pages !
This year ZJU-China consists of 14 members, who  can be separated into  2 groups, including the wet-lab group and the dry-lab group. Wet-lab group members have the background in life science and medical  science while the dry-lab group members mainly major in engineering and computer science. This year, ZJU-China focused on developing an in-vitro diagnostic device whose idea was first brought out after rounds of brainstorming. After identifying the direction of our project, we always worked together, designing and optimizing our products rounds by rounds accompanied with  a continuous process of Human Practice.
Unless otherwise stated, all the experiments, constructs, logos and results documented on our wiki were performed, composed and collected by ourselves.
