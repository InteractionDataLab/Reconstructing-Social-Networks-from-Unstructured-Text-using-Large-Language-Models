ALL PARTS  
OVERVIEW  
This year, we designed 23 parts, and all of them had been submitted to the iGEM Registry following the BioBricks assembly standard as described by RFC10.
Here is a brief description of our parts. If you want to get more detailed information about our parts, we strongly recommend you visit the corresponding parts pages on the iGEM BioBricks Registry.

Best New Basic Part
BBa_k2721010
Curli is the major component of extra-cellular matrix produced by certain strains of Enterobacteriaceae. This part codes for CsgA, the monomer of Curli fibers which is an ideal material of biofilm. Click here to see more details.
Best New Composite Part
BBa_k2721036
This part codes for HRP(Horseradish Peroxidase), SnoopTag and SdyCatcher. Target DNA sequence of this part was optimized and synthesized. We cloned the synthesized sequence into vector pET-26b(+) and successfully expressed the target protein. Click here to see more details.
Best Part Collection
BBa_k2721027~BBa_k2721029
The main biofunction of our final product lies in the three connected enzymes. So the best part collection codes for the three enzymes LDH(Lactate Dehydrogenase), GOx (Glucose Oxidase) and HRP(Horseradish Peroxidase) separately flanked by different tag-catcher pairs. Click here to see more details.
Improve T7 promoters
BBa_k2721000~BBa_k2721003
Known for its highly yields of recombinant proteins, T7 promoter is currently one of the most widely used promoters in genetic engineering. This year, we did site-directed mutagenesis to get some mutants with even higher efficiency of protein expression. We chose GFP as a reporter to test the function of our modified T7 promoters.
