CURLI 
OVERVIEW 
This year, we are developing a project which utilizes three orthogonal connection systems to detect enzyme-catalyzed reaction products qualitatively and quantitatively. To make the enzyme complex and our detection device (which is an interdigital electrode) connected, we choose the curli system of E. coli to create a functional nanofiber network to serve as a mediator.
Introduction
It has been proved that enzymes can be used in purified form. And the biocatalysis is a high efficient and environmental friendly manner which has great potential in industry. However, its production efficiency is limited by low mass transport stemming from hindered diffusion of the substrate or product across the cell membrane. Thus we do need an approach that optimally combines the criteria of high surface area, enhanced enzyme stability, rapid mass transport, and modularity. It had been elusive until the researchers from Harvard University developed a protein immobilization platform that modifies curli nanofibers, the amyloid fiber component of E. coli biofilms, with a peptide domain that can covalently capture proteins. [1]
According to the article published in 2015, [1] the process of the biofilm functionalization with enzymes through the covalent modification of curli fibers is showed in Picture 1. First, E. coli expresses CsgA fused to the 13 amino acid SpyTag (CsgA-ST), which self-assembles into curli fibers on the surface of the bacterium (A). Then it was covalently modified with an enzyme fused to SpyCatcher (B). Finally, substrate to product catalysis occurs on the high surface-area catalytic fibers (C).
Fig.1 How enzymes are linked to curli fibers [1]
In our approach, we are going to transform PHL628-△csgA cells with pBbE1a plasmids with CsgA-SpyTag to express curli as the base. Curli from different strains will connect adjacent bacteria to form biofilm. Since there’re three orthogonal systems — SpyTag/SpyCatcher, SnoopTag/SnoopCatcher and SdyTag/SdyCatcher , we will synthesize a string of three enzymes rather than one single SpyCatcher-Enzyme. The method is illustrated in Picture 2.

As it was mentioned in the beginning, the curli fiber system serves as a mediator between enzymes and the electrode. We have to pay attention to its efficiency. So another thing we do is to insert two histidine-tags into CsgA (the major subunit of the curli fiber) so that curli fibers can be specifically associated to NiNTA-AuNPs, and then to the electrode. [2] With the help of NiNTA-AuNPs, electrons released by enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions are delivered to the electrode much more quickly.
