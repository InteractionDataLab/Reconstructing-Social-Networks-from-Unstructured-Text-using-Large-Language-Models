PRODUCT DESIGN 
By immobilizing the multi-enzyme complex on the interdigitated electrode, we performed a logical operation at the protein level. The interdigital transmits the catalyzed results to an electrochemical output and sends the signal to the mobile phone terminal (WeChat App) via Bluetooth, ultimately enabling rapid detection of the disease.
The world needs POCT, and it needs an instrument that can give accurate diagnosis results in the shortest time. This is the goal of our project.

Comparison Protein Logic Circuits VS Single Enzymes on Traditional Enzyme Electrodes
Conventional enzyme electrodes can only detect a single substance and only give concentration results. In contrast, the protein logic circuit processes multiple substances in parallel and performs logical operations - The results are 1 (sick) and 0 (normal), which is clear enough for nonspecialists. The time required for diagnosis is greatly reduced. (It only takes half a minute). The determination of the enzyme sequence and the way of connection can be designed and replaced, which are in line with the idea of synthetic biology.
Faster detection, smaller size, and easier-to-understand UI interface .  Our product can transmit detection signals to the mobile terminal via Bluetooth. The diagnose results can be viewed and easily understand by WeChat app.
Second generation (A detector II)   VS  first generation (A detector I)
ForA detector Ⅰ, having a large size is acceptable because it is considered to be placed in an emergency room. However, after consulting with doctors and experts, we learned that many patients died even before being sent to the emergency room because of incorrect diagnosis and improper treatment. This ratio can be as high as 40% in many acute conditions. Based on this, we have worked hard to develop A detector Ⅱ. It is only 10cm wide × 18cm long and portable. While retaining testing capabilities of A detector Ⅰ, the volume of A detector Ⅱ is greatly reduced. This means it can be applied in more areas - Ambulance, battlefield, crime scene, home. In short, the practicality of the second generation has been greatly improved.

Possible adverse effects of the project:
Cross-infection of blood.
We obtained a regulated blood sample from a certified hospital, So the risk is not obvious during the prototype phase.
In the actual application phase of the product, we will ensure that the risk of cross-infection of blood is minimized through the handling of blood collection needles and the treatment of blood waste. Details can be found in Safety .
