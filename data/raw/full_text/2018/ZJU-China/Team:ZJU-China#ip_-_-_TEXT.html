HARDWARE  
ABSTRACT  
We use a 2D printer to print materials onto IDE to modify it. Then we use breadboard to assemble each component and make an entire circuit. The circuit is connected to an iPhone through Bluetooth. We get some blood samples from Sir Run Run Shao Hospital and use them to certify the accuracy of our hardware and enzyme IDE. Everything proves to work fine.
