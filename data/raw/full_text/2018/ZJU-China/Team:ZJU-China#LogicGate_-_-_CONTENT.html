With fused tags and catchers, several important properties of these enzymes had to be tested in order for a better performance on our applied design products. </P></DIV><DIV class="cnt_psg"><DIV class="psg"><SPAN class="psg_ttl">VERIFICATION OF EXPRESSED ENZYMES AND PURIFICATION AFTERWARD</SPAN><P>To obtain the maximum of functional protein yield for electrode fixation use, the best expression strategy had to be applied and adjusted for different proteins. The variables could be different vectors, different purification tags or different expression conditions. After induction and expression, we verified our expression product by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining and desired proteins were observed in verification assays. GOx and HRP were well expressed for a yield &gt;20mg/L in pET-30a(+) and BL21(DE3) after a 15℃ 16h induction. On the contrary, LDH can only reach a maximum yield of 2 mg/L in the same condition. In the subsequent experiements, we managed to find the best condition by changing the purification tag from His tag to His-GST tag or the host from BL21(DE3) to RosettaTM 2(DE3). At last, we determined specific expression and purification strategy customized for each enzyme as showed in the diagram.</P><H5 style="vertical-align: top; width: 5% !important; display: inline-block;">Fig. 1</H5><H5 style="font-weight: 300 !important; text-align: left; padding-left: 2% !important; width: 93% !important; display: inline-block;"><SPAN style="font-weight: bolder !important;">Verification of expressed enzymes and purification afterward.</SPAN> (A) SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, Western Blot mapping showed success expression of GOD-His tag in BL21(DE3). (B) SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, Western Blot mapping showed success expression of HRP-His tag in BL21(DE3). (C) SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, Western Blot mapping showed success expression of LDH-His tag in BL21(DE3). (D) The diagram showed different expression conditions for enzymes to find the best expression strategy for the maximum yield.</H5><SPAN class="psg_ttl" style="font-size: 1em !important;">optimal fixation condition in Nafion and AuNP for maximum enzymatic activities</SPAN><P>To mediate electron in the active centers of enzymes to the surface of electrodes, some mediator must add to the surface layer of enzyme immobilization. As reported, Au nanoparticles (AuNP) have a nice performance to carry electrons to electrodes and also serve as an electron-transduction layer<SUP style="font-size:.6em">[4][5]</SUP>. While Curli fibers provide a biocompatible matrix for the enrichment of functional proteins, the conductivity has to be considered and Nafion has superior conductive properties which recently found a great application prospect in biosensor surface modification.<SUP style="font-size:.6em">[6][7]</SUP></P><P>But it still remained unknown whether AuNP or Nafion can play as an enzyme inhibitor. So, we had to test the optimal modification or concentration of AuNP or Nafion to maintain the maximum enzyme activities. As showed in figure, different enzyme has different response to AuNP, GOx (GOD) is sensitive while the activity of HRP and LDH is not largely influenced. For Nafion fixation, we ultimately decided a final dosage of 1.0 µL, while AuNP dosage was decided to be 0.5 µL.</P><H5 style="vertical-align: top; width: 5% !important; display: inline-block;">Fig. 2</H5><H5 style="font-weight: 300 !important; text-align: left; padding-left: 2% !important; width: 93% !important; display: inline-block;"><SPAN style="font-weight: bolder !important;">Optimal fixative condition in Nafion and AuNP for maximum enzymatic activities.</SPAN>(A) The figure shows while AuNP (0.5 μL) is added to the system, the activity of GOx (GOD) is significantly decreased. (B) Nafion gradient activity assay indicates Nafion has a profound negative influence on GOx. When Nafion dosage is ~1.0 μL, GOx maintains the maximum activity. (C) Figure shows AuNP (0.5 μL) does not cause significant inhibition to HRP.  (D) Nafion gradient activity assay. When Nafion dosage is ~1.0 μL, HRP maintains the maximum activity. (E) Subsequent to experiements on GOx and HRP, final AuNP dosage was fixed to while Nafion, 1.0 μL, in order to maintain GOx and HRP activity at the maximum. Under this condition, LDH is not significantly inhibited comparing with native enzyme (definition of enzyme activity unit (U) of Lactate dehydrogenase: 1 mg of enzyme catalyze 1 nmol pyruvate per minute. The concentration of pyruvate is determined by the change in absorbance (A450) and the standard curve. GOx and HRP activities are all measured under kit manufacturing instruction).</H5><SPAN class="psg_ttl" style="font-size: 1em !important;">comparison tests between native enzymes and fused enzymes</SPAN><P>In the pilot expression assay, GFP-T (tag only) and GFP-TC (tag and catcher) showed distinct capability on fluorescence. So, we did experiments on the comparison of native enzyme activities and fused enzyme activities. As showed in Figure 4B, modified enzymes showed a significantly decreased activity. Furthermore, to find whether the decrease of activity will affect the final performance of logic gate enzyme complex. We did tests on logic gate function with modified protein subsequently.</P><H5 style="vertical-align: top; width: 5% !important; display: inline-block;">Fig. 3</H5><H5 style="font-weight: 300 !important; text-align: left; padding-left: 2% !important; width: 93% !important; display: inline-block;"><SPAN style="font-weight: bolder !important;">Ligation results and comparison test of native and modified enzymes.</SPAN>(A) SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining shows purified tag-enzyme-catcher proteins and ligation product. &quot;a&quot; arrow pointed to LDH-GOD complex (~110KDa), while &quot;b&quot; arrow pointed to HRP-LDH complex (~115KDa). B. Comparison test of native and modified enzymes. GOx (GOD), LDH and HRP activities were all decreased because of the fused tags/catchers and Nafion or AuNP. But whether the catalytic activity can still perform a logic gate outcome remained unknown. </H5><SPAN class="psg_ttl">ligation results of fused enzymes</SPAN><P>The ligation of tag and catchers and also the orthogonality has been illustrated in the tag-XFP-catcher experiments.

To demonstrate whether our design has the logic gate function, we made a simulation in the condition exactly the same with our final applied design (including the final concentration of AuNP and Nafion, and also the enzymes used were linked via fused tags and catchers). The difference lied in the final representation of output signal. In this experiment, we used the characteristic 340nm absorbance of NADH as showed in the schematic.
