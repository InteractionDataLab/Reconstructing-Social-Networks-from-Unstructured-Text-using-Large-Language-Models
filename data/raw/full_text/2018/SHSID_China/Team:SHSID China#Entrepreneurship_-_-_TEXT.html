Overview
To ensure success in our experiments, Human Practice and various activities, we have implemented a series of initiatives in financial management, fund-raising, and sponsorship.
Financial Management
We collected public funds, handed them to our treasurer and made detailed records of each entry, which improves the overall efficiency of equipment purchasing, organizing events and prevents confusion. Apart from public funds, company sponsorship also contributed to our economic success.
Fund-raising
We described our science project on a fund-raising website to attract sponsors interested scientific research and development to attain their help and support.
Sponsorship
In addition, we contacted several chemical industry companies (2Y-Chem, Ltd., Xiamen Fine Chemical Import and Export Co., Ltd., Jiangsu Baozong & Baoda pharmachem Co., Ltd.) who provided us with great support. In the end, we raised approximately 800 USD.
Conclusion
In conclusion, Through these measures, we have experienced a realistic research process and demonstrated great commercial competence and thinking skills in the field of Entrepreneurship.
