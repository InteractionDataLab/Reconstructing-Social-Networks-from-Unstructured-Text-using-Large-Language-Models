Introduction
As in all of the natural sciences, repeatability and comparability of experiments and data are essential to future development. The same holds true for synthetic biology, where it is especially important, as labs require research from other labs to build off of. However, it is not uncommon for different labs to report measurements in different units, resulting in an inconvenient variability between labs. As a result, our team has decided to participate in the Fifth International InterLab Measurement Study, which aims to reduce systematic variability between labs. Specifically, we will be aiming to reduce variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of using optical density (OD).

Table 1: Calibration results with our OD600/Abs600 conversion factor
According to the calibration test, our calculated OD600 to Abs600 conversion factor is 3.234.
2. Particle Standard Curves
Figure 1(a): Particle standard curve
Figure 1(b): Particle standard curve on a logarithmic scale
Despite the particle standard curve being a linear line, converting it into a log scale makes the graph non-linear.
3. Fluorescein Standard Curves
Figure 2(a): Fluorescein standard curve
Figure 2(b): Fluorescein standard curve on a logarithmic scale
Both non-logarithmic and log scale for the fluorescein standard curve appear to be linear.

Conclusion
We wish to thank iGEM for providing detailed protocols, materials, and this wonderful opportunity to participate in the InterLab. We have thoroughly enjoyed the InterLab and hope that our findings will contribute and corroborate those across different laboratories.
