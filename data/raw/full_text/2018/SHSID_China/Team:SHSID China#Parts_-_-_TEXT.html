Parts Summary
We have created and documented a total of 5 parts onto the Parts Registry.
Part BBa_K2836001 is the luxG gene from Aliivibrio fischeri strain ES114, and encodes flavin reductase that participates in reduced flavin mononucleotide turnover, which is a substrate for the luciferase-catalyzed light emitting reaction encoded by the lux operon in bioluminescent bacteria.
Part BBa_K2836002 is a composite part consisting of the lux operon (part BBa_K325909) fused with an additional luxG gene (part BBa_K2836001), as luxG and flavin reductase have been shown to increase the intensity of light produced, thus improving upon the previous characterization of the lux operon (part BBa_K325909) by iGEM 10_Cambridge team.
Part BBa_K2836003 is the grpE promoter, which is a heat shock protein capable of increasing transcription rates when put under chemical stress from compounds such as ethanol, sodium propionate, sodium acetate, hydrogen peroxide, changes in temperature and UV radiation.
Parts BBa_K2836004 and BBa_K2836005 are composite parts made with the grpE promoter from BBa_K2836003 ligated with part BBa_K2836002 and part BBa_K325909 respectively to put bacterial autoluminescence under the control of a regulatory promoter.
Criteria for Medals:
1. Silver #1 (Validated Part): We submitted part BBa_K2836001 (http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2836001) as the new BioBrick part of our own creation.
2. Gold #2 (Improve a Previous Part): We submitted part BBa_K2836002 (http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2836002) as a new BioBrick part that has a functional improvement upon an existing part (BBa_K325909).
