Experiment Protocols
Transformation
1. Prepare 100 μL 1×KCM by adding 80 μL double distilled H2O and 20 μL 5×KCM into an EP tube and store it in an EP tube.
2. Add 10 μL of the prepared plasmid solution into the EP tube and place it on ice.
3. Take competent cells from -80 degrees storage and thaw in ice for 2-3 minutes.
4. Put 100 μL of competent cell into the EP tube, place on ice for 30 minutes.
5. Take out the EP tube and put it into a 42 degrees water bath for 90 seconds.
6. Take out the EP tube from the water bath and immediately place it on ice and wait for 3 minutes.
7. Add 800 μL of liquid LB (without the desired antibiotic) into the EP tube.
8. Put the EP tube into incubator shaker of 37 degrees for 40 minutes with a speed of 220-240 rpm.
9. Take out the EP tube and put it into a centrifuge with a speed of 12000g for 30 seconds.
10. Take the EP tube from the centrifuge and proceed the following steps in a laminar flow clean bench.
11. Extract and dispense 800 μL of supernatant (when inserting the pipette into the EP tube, do not touch the condensed solid at the bottom).
12. Pipette up and down (with a smaller pipette tip) to mix the remainder of the solution inside the EP tube. Avoid creating bubbles, so mix gently, but thoroughly until nothing remains at the bottom.
13. Using a pipette, deliver 200 μL of the solution onto the LB petri dish (containing the desired antibiotic, which can be added in a 1:1000 ratio with the LB media prior to its solidification on the petri dish).
14. Slightly burn another pipette tip on fire for 2 seconds, then bend it.
15. With the bent pipette tip, spread the solution on the petri dish.
16. Close the petri dish lid and write down the sample name and the date this was performed.
17. Flip the petri dish upside down and put into a 37 degrees constant temperature and humidity incubator. Wait for 16-18 hours.
Plasmid Miniprep (Spin) (as provided by Axygen and modified)
1. Collect 1-4 ml of overnight LB culture (depending on the amount of bacteria grown). Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute to pellet the bacteria. Decant or pipette off as much of the supernatant as practical.
2. Resuspend the bacterial pellet in 250 μl of Buffer S1 by vortexing.
3. Add 250 μl of Buffer S2, and mix by gently inverting the tube for 4-6 times.
4. Add 350 µl of Buffer S3, and mix by gently inverting 6-8 times. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 10 minutes to clarify the lysate.

Agrobacterium-mediated Transformation

2. Centrifuge the agrobacteria solutions at 12000 g for 1 min, and remove the supernatant.
3. Resuspend the agrobacteria in a 0.01 mol MgCl2 solution.
4. Add an acetosyringone solution, making a final solution concentration of 0.2 M.
5. Leave aside for 3 hours at 25-28 °C in order to fully activate the agrobacteria cells.
6. Use a disposable syringe and inject the solution into the plant’s leaves. [Note: this can be done by placing a finger under the leaf at the position of the syringe, and gently pressing against the syringe tip while injecting the solution.]
Gel Extraction (as provided by Axygen and modified)
1. Excise the agarose gel slice containing the DNA fragment of interest with a clean, sharp scalpel under ultraviolet illumination. Briefly place the excised gel slice on absorbent toweling to remove residual buffer. Transfer the gel slice to a piece or plastic wrap or a weighing boat. Mince the gel into small pieces and weigh. In this application, the weight of gel is regarded as equivalent to the volume. Transfer the gel slice into a 1.5 ml microfuge tube.
2. Add a 3x sample volume of Buffer DE-A into the microfuge tube.
3. Resuspend the gel in Buffer DE-A by vortexing. Heat at 75°C until the gel is completely dissolved. Intermittent vortexing (every 2-3 minutes) will accelerate gel solubilization.
4. Add 0.5x Buffer DE-A volume of Buffer DE-B, mix.
5. Place a Miniprep column into a 2 ml microfuge tube. Transfer the solubilized agarose from Step 4 into the column. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute.
6. Discard the filtrate from the 2 ml microfuge tube. Return the Miniprep column to the 2 ml microfuge tube and add 500 μL of Buffer W1. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 30 seconds.
7. Discard the filtrate from the 2 ml microfuge tube. Return the Miniprep column to the 2 ml microfuge tube and add 700 μL of Buffer W2. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 30 seconds.
8. Discard the filtrate from the 2 ml microfuge tube. Place the Miniprep column back into the 2 ml microfuge tube. Add a second 700 μL aliquot of Buffer W2 and centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute. (Note: Two washes with Buffer W2 are used to ensure the complete removal of salt, eliminating potential problems in subsequent enzymatic reactions, such as ligation and sequencing reaction.)
9. Discard the filtrate from the 2 ml microfuge tube. Place the Miniprep column back into the 2 ml microfuge tube. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute. 10. Transfer the Miniprep column into a clean 1.5 ml microfuge tube. To elute the DNA, add 30-50 μL of deionized water to the center of the membrane. Let it stand for 1 minute at room temperature. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute.
