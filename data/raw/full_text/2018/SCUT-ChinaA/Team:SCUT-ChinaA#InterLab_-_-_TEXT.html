Background
All of the 2018 iGEM teams are invited and encouraged to participate in the Fifth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology. Our team join in this study which aims to standardize the measurements of GFP’s fluorescence. Different from the Fourth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study, this year we measured both OD and colony-forming units (CFUs) to find out whether we can reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or CFUs instead of OD. In this study, we were using plate reader for measuring.

Discussion
In conclusion, the data above demonstrate that we finished our InterLab Study successfully.  Through this process, we found that OD varies greatly from one instrument to another, while CFUs depends less on instruments. Besides the instrument difference, different teams may use different optimization when measuring fluorescence (we used the optimization of 40 to get optimal values), which increases the variety of OD measurement. But all teams’ methods of counting colonies and calculating CFUs is generally the same. So we consider that CFUs can be a more normalizing standard to fluorescence measurement instead of OD.
