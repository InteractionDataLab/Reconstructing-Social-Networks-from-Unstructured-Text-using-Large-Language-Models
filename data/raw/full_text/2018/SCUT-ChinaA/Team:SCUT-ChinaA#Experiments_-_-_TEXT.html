Construction
1.Design
In our project, for obtaining various engineered strains, we applied module assembly technology like gibson assembly and overlap extension PCR to construct gene expression modules in E. coli. In the process of pathway construction, we successfully constructed pUC19-NDPS1-LS, pUC19-Catcher-NDPS1-Tag-LS, pUC19-tHMG1, pUC19-ERG8-ERG12-ERG19, pCAS1yl-ku70, pCAS1yl-pox5, respectively. The upstream and downstream regions are homologous to the target integration site and prepared for homologous recombination in further gene editing. The LEU2 and URA3 was used for selection in Y. lipolytica and the AmpR was used in E.coli. NotI restriction sites was added between the homology regions. These plasmids will be further linearized in the subsequent steps.
2.Method
Gibson assembly
The method can simultaneously combine up to 15 DNA fragments based on sequence identity. It requires that the DNA fragments contain ~20-40 base pair overlap with adjacent DNA fragments. These DNA fragments are mixed with a cocktail of three enzymes, along with other buffer components. The three required enzyme activities are: exonuclease, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase. The exonuclease chews back DNA from the 5' end, thus not inhibiting polymerase activity and allowing the reaction to occur in one single process. The resulting single-stranded regions on adjacent DNA fragments can anneal. The DNA polymerase incorporates nucleotides to fill in any gaps. The DNA ligase covalently joins the DNA of adjacent segments, thereby removing any nicks in the DNA.
The detailed protocol is as follows:
1.    Add overlap region to adjacent DNA fragments via PCR;
2.    Combine the to-be-assembled DNA to a total volume of 5 μl;
3.    On ice, add 15μl Master Mix to the DNA, mix well and briefly centrifuge;
4.    Incubate at 50℃ for 1 hour;
5.    Store reactions at -20℃ or proceed to transformation.
Integration
1.Design
After the successfully construction of various expression modules, we linearized them with NotI and then were transformed into competent Po1f cells together, using the kit, Frozen-EZ yeast transformation II. After transformation, cells were cultured on SD medium plates without uracil or leucine. The URA3 marker was integrated into the cells along with the expression cassettes, which would affect the insertion of subsequent gene expression modules. Therefore, YPD media supplemented with 1 mg/mL 5-FOA was used for URA3 marker plasmid removal. Screening for integration was accomplished using colony PCR of single colonies. Furthermore, we would further verify it by extracting the genome of the yeast, using the kit from TIANGEN Biotech (Beijing, China). At the transcriptional level, we verified the transcription of the integrated gene modules by quantitative PCR with a kit from TAKARA BIO INC.
2.    Method
Transformation
First, prepare the yeast competent cells. Grow yeast cells at 30℃ in 10ml YPD broth until mid-log phase (OD600 of 0.8-1.0). The following steps are accomplished at room temperature.
1.    Pellet the cells at 500 x g for 4 minutes and discard the supernatant.
2.    Add 10 ml EZ 1 solution to wash the pellet. Repellet the cells and discard the supernatant.
3.    Add 1 ml EZ 2 solution to resuspend the pellet.
At this point, the competent cells can be used for transformations directly or stored frozen at or below -70℃ for future used. It is important to freeze the cells slowly. To accomplish this, either wrap the aliquoted cells in 2-6 layers of paper towels or place in a Styrofoam box before placing in the freezer. Do not use liquid nitrogen to snap-freeze the cells.
With yeast competent cells, we can then carry out yeast transformation.
1.    Mix 50 μl of competent cells with 0.2-1 μg DNA (in less than 5 μl volume); add 500 μl EZ 3 solution and mix thoroughly.
2.    Incubate at 30℃ for 45 minutes. Mix vigorously by flicking with finger or vortexing (if appropriate for your DNA) 2-3 times during this incubation.
3.    Spread 50-150 μl of the above transformation mixture on an appropriate plate. It is unnecessary to pellet and wash the cells before spreading.
4.    Incubate the plate at 30℃ for 2-4 days to allow for growth of transformations.
Yeast total RNA Extraction
Most of RNA in the cell is bound to protein and exists as nuclear protein. Therefore, RNA is separated and removed from protein when extracting RNA. The cells are placed in a buffer containing sodium dodecylsulfonate, and then water-saturated phenol and chloroform are added to it. Through vigorous shaking and centrifuging, the liquid is divided into the upper aqueous phase and the lower phenol phase. The nucleic acid is dissolved in the aqueous phase, the protein denatured by the phenol is either dissolved in the phenol phase, or forming a gel layer at the interface of the two phases. The upper aqueous phase is collected and the RNA is precipitated from the aqueous solution with ethanol.
All necessary materials for the experiment should be prepared as described below:
1.    0.2% DEPC-treated water: Wash and dry a wide-mouth bottle, wash it with hydrogen peroxide for 3 times, and then wash it with absolute ethanol for 3 times.

Fermentation
1.Design
After repeated validation, we inoculated engineered strains into the medium for two-phase fermentation. For exploring the difference between yeast growth and product yield between different species sources of LS, we introduced two kinds of LS genes expression cassettes to compare the growth curves. We first carried out the fermentation for six consecutive days, taking samples once a day to obtain the growth curve of the yeast. At the same time, the content of limonene was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy.
2.    Method
Yeast cultivation
During the fermentation, the engineered strains are cultured with liquid YPD medium. First, all strains were inoculated into a 250 ml shake flask containing 40 ml medium. When the strains in the shake flask grow to an OD600 value of about 1.0, the next step can be performed. The formal fermentation system was carried out in a 250 ml shake flask containing 50 ml of medium and 2 ml of N-dodecane, which function as an organic extractant to extract the product. The initial OD600 of the fermentation was 0.1. The fermentation will be carried out for six days at 30 °C and 220 rpm, with taking samples once a day. All flask fermentation results represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.
Limonene detection
For limonene detection, the dodecane layers were collected and myrcene was used as an internal standard.  Then the sample (1 μL) was analyzed by GC using an Agilent System 6890 gas chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 5975 quadrupole mass selective detector (EI) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), equipped with a HP-5 (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) GC column. The GC oven temperature program was set as follows: 100 °C for 1 min, a ramp of 0.5 °C/min to 102 °C, and then a rise to 240 °C in 6 min with a final holding time of 2 min. The split ratio was 30:1. Limonene and myrcene standards (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) were used for quantification.
Discussion
We have elaborated on most of the experimental methods we have used here, and we omitted some basic experimental methods, such as PCR and the transformation of E. coli. We had been very struggle in the process of conducting experiments before. To overcome these difficulties, we have carried out a lot of exploratory experiments for optimizing the protocols here, such as the source of the gene and the method of RNA extraction. We will continue to maintain this spirit of unremitting struggle, explore and seek knowledge, and continue our path to “defeating monsters and upgrading”.
