We standardized some integration modules involved in our project. The sequences of our integration modules have been codon-optimized for the heterologously expression in Yarrowia lipolytica and are able to successfully transcribe. The standardized modules we build can be used with each other. The two terminators provided have been verified that can stop the transcriptional activity of the transcription complex effectively, and can be used widely in Y. lipolytica. The part SpyCatcher can be fused with other enzyme involved in the metabolic pathway. Thus together with the SpyTag, by constructing metabolic coupling modules thereby enhancing the metabolic flux, In theory, the inhibition of any rate-limiting step in the pathway can be released. SpyTag-Ls is an assembly module successfully built in our project. Tag and LS are connected by PT linker. The part tHMG1 is recognized as a rate-limiting enzyme in the MVA pathway, and increasing its copy number can definitely enhance the metabolic flux of MVA.
