Collaborations
Safety
During the project, of course, it is indispensable to communicate with other iGEM teams. Therefore, we exchanged opinions with many other iGEM teams to solve the problems we encountered together. Among them, we have carried out further cooperation and communication with the two iGEM teams: Sun Yat-sen University and South China Agricultural University. We finished an indispensable part of each otherâ€™s projects and made critical work.
SYSU-software
SYSU-software is a friendly and open team. We had a meetup and exchange our project. With a presentation, they introduced their software to us, a multi-functional collaboration platform. Their software amazed us and we thought it can be useful in genetic circuit collaboration design. However, they ignored a fact that experimental protocol was also an important element in collaboration. So, in the meetup, we came up with this idea. They took much amount of it and verified their software based on our suggestion, adding a new function of editing protocol. Also, SYSU-software took a lot of time help us make the navigation bar of our wiki.
South China Agricultural University
The team from South China Agricultural University is also friendly and accommodating. In our project, they helped us determine differences in yeast growth and tested for its activity. At the same time, we helped them extract the Acetobacter xylinum genome. Both of us have made a contribution that cannot be ignored to each other.
