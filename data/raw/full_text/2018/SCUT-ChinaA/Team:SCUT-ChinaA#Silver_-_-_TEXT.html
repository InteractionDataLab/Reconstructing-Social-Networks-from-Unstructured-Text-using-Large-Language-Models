Self-enhancement
As scientific researchers, we must have a scientific basis for all our work, and repeatedly verify the arisen, upcoming and potential problems. Therefore, we need experts from different fields to help answer our questions in various fields. To learn about the latest research trends and enrich our project, we came to the 4th Seminar on Synthetic Biology Young Scholars.
Safety
Although Yarrowia lipolytica has undergone many tests and is a relatively mature engineered strain, but if we still have to ensure that they are always within safe limits through good laboratory practices and careful awareness. In addition, we understand environmental and personal protective measures and strictly comply with the requirements in the laboratory to prevent leakage or contamination risks.
Education
Although more and more people are paying attention to synthetic biology and molecular biology, there are still many people who have misunderstandings about biology or fear of biological tools such as transgenic technology and gene editing technology. To let more people learn about biology, we went to elementary school and brought the latest biological knowledge to the children there.
Public engagement
While conducting our experimental projects, we also actively organized or participated in communications with other iGEM teams. Through learning exchange activities again and again, we continued to draw on one of the parties and eventually improved our project.
