After consulting with several fermentation engineering experts and conducting field research, we found that how to screen out the optimal wiring method is the most important thing in establishing cell engineering. So, in order to achieve the goal of the cell factory, we modeled the metabolic pathway of Yarrowia lipolytica and finally designed an available software, which can obtain the corresponding optimal metabolic by simply inputting and outputting data.
iGEM popularization
In the process of communicating with the outside world, we found that synthetic biology is still only a few people's carnival, which is still unattainable for most ordinary people. So we have organized many science education activities, not only describing our project to the public, but also popularizing science education and promoting iGEM. In this process, we gained a lot of partners, and under our promotion, we were honored to guide Jinshan High School to participate in next year's iGEM.
Social work
After our research and analysis, we found that most people are looking forward to synthetic biology, but they also have concerns. So, we need a more suitable entry point to integrate synthetic biology into more people's lives instead of boring presentation. In order to keep up with the footsteps of the Internet era, we rely on WECHAT to develop a set of emojis that can be applied to normal life, hoping to bring the distance between synthetic biology and ordinary people closer, and attract them to understand the interest of biology.
We are very happy that this set of emojis has been well received by students.
