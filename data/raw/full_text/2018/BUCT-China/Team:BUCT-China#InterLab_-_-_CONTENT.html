Take 500 µL samples of the diluted cultures at 0 hours into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes,     prior to incubation. (At each time point 0 hours and 6 hours, you will take a sample from each of the 8 devices, two colonies per device, for a total of 16 eppendorf tubes with 500 µL samples per time point, 32 samples total). Place the samples on ice.  f. Incubate the remainder of the cultures at 37°C and 220 rpm for 6 hours.   g. Take 500 µL samples of the cultures at 6 hours of incubation into 1.5 ml eppendorf   tubes.

Import data into Excel sheet provided (​fluorescence measurement tab​) 
</P><H3>Measurement:</H3><P>Samples should be laid out according to the plate diagram below. Pipette 100 µl of each sample into each well. From 500 µl samples in a 1.5 ml eppendorf tube, 4 replicate samples of colony #1 should be pipetted into wells in rows A, B, C and D. Replicate samples of colony #2 should be pipetted into wells in rows E, F, G and H.  Be sure to include 8 control wells containing 100uL each of only LB+chloramphenicol on each plate in column 9, as shown in the diagram below. Set the instrument settings as those that gave the best results in your calibration curves (no measurements off scale). If necessary you can test more than one of the previously calibrated settings to get the best data (no measurements off scale). Instrument temperature should be set to room temperature (approximately 20-25 C) if your instrument has variable temperature settings. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><H1>Protocol: Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E. coli cultures</H1><P><B>This procedure can be used to calibrate OD600 to colony forming unit (CFU) counts, which are directly relatable to the cell concentration of the culture, i.e. viable cell counts per mL.  This protocol assumes that 1 bacterial cell will give rise to 1 colony.
For the CFU protocol, you will need to count colonies for your two Positive Control (BBa_I20270) cultures and your two Negative Control (BBa_R0040) cultures.
</B></P><H3>Step 1: Starting Sample Preparation </H3><P><B>Standard Tracks:</B> This protocol will result in CFU/mL for 0.1 OD600. Your overnight cultures will have a much higher OD600 and so this section of the protocol, called “Starting Sample Preparation”,  will  give you the “Starting Sample” with a 0.1 OD600 measurement. 
</P><H3>Step 2: Dilution Series Instructions</H3><P><B>Standard Tracks:</B>Do the following serial dilutions for your triplicate Starting Samples you prepared in Step 1. You should have 12 total Starting Samples - 6 for your Positive Controls and 6 for your Negative Controls
</P><H3>Step 3: CFU/mL/OD Calculation Instructions </H3><P><B>Standard Tracks:</B> Based on the assumption that 1 bacterial cell gives rise to 1 colony, colony forming units (CFU) per 1mL of an OD600 = 0.1 culture can be calculated as &quot;colonies   x   Final Dilution Factor  =  CFU/mL &quot;
