The arabinose operon on the vector plasmid is located upstream of the operon of interest, thereby conferring viability on the operon of interest. At the same time, the AMP resistance gene on the vector plasmid facilitates subsequent screening of the target colony</LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="column two_thirds_size"><H3>Preliminarily verify the function of the operon</H3><UL><LI> Principle : Both the arabinose operon and our target operon produce a repressor protein, and the repressor protein binds to the operon.[1] When RNA polymerase is transcribed, it is blocked by the repressor protein, and transcription cannot be performed, thereby inhibiting transcription. Taking the fatty acid operon as an example, when we add arabinose, arabinose binds to the repressor protein on the arabinose operon and causes it to fall off. RNA polymerase is slid through the arabinose operon and slid to the downstream fatty acid operon to be repressed by a repressor protein on the fatty acid operon. At this time, we add fatty acids, and the fatty acids bind to the repressor protein, causing it to fall off. RNA polymerase continues to slide and slides over the fluorescent protein gene downstream of the operon to express the fluorescent protein. </LI><LI> Conversion：Introducing plasmid into competent cells </LI><LI> Set different inducer gradients </LI>
 Arabinose: Add 200 μL of 5% arabinose solution
 Fatty acid: add 100 μL of 100mmol/L fatty acid solution

The difference is that we can establish the mathematical model by measuring the fluorescence value of the culture under the same conditions of the OD value of each culture.Fluorescence value is proportional to the relationship between time.</LI><LI> Experimental protocol: For the fatty acid operon, we designed four control groups to measure the fluorescence value.
