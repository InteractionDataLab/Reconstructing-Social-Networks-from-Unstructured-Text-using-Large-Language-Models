Description
The GntR family is a class of genes with potential transcriptional regulatory functions located in the genome of a cell.[1] Many members of the GntR family have been shown to play an important role in the survival of various strains such as Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis under various stressful conditions.
Research results in recent years
At present, several structures of the TetR family FadR protein having a fatty acyl-CoA (C12-C18) have been identified, but the current TetR family FadR protein has a structure that binds to its homologous DNA. Therefore, the structural conformation and functional requirements of FadR binding to DNA and the dissociation of FadR-DNA induced by effector molecules are unclear and require further investigation. The function of FadR has been studied thoroughly. The FadR family of transcriptional regulators can affect the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. When there is no long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, FadR hinders the degradation of fatty acids; when there is long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, FadR acts to inhibit the degradation of fatty acids by FadR through interaction with certain proteins.[2]Regarding the research on transcription factors, there are now more mature research methods, such as CHIP-sep method, DNaseI method, and reporter gene analysis method. On this basis, we are preparing to study other transcriptional regulators of FadR and GntR. I hope to have a deeper understanding of the transcriptional regulators in the FadR and GntR families. Try to synthesize transcriptional regulators with new or multifunctional functions that can be further exploited. [3]
Innovation
1、To research and summarizes the key sequences, action sites and related mechanisms of transcriptional regulators that have not yet been developed, thus helping people to have a clearer and more accurate understanding and understanding of the GntR/FadR family of transcriptional regulators;
2、Based on the summarized key sequences, the project will attempt to construct transcriptional regulatory factors with new functions or versatility or better performance, enriching the library of transcriptional regulatory factors；
3、Through the related research, the FadR factor was transformed and used as a transcriptional regulator of key metabolite-related pathways. Through the dynamic process of products in dynamic microbial cells, the yield and quality of target products were improved, and the FadR factor was expanded in synthetic biology. The application has a certain meaning.
