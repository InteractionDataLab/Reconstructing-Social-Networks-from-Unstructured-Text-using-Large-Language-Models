Beijing University of Chemical Technology iGEM contest presentation
In order to enable more students to understand and understand synthetic biology and iGEM competitions, we held an iGEM presentation at our school, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, led by our tutor Liu.
The teacher first briefed the students on synthetic biology and its meaning and role. During the introduction process, Mr. Liu also added the current research foundation and pointed out that it is very convenient to conduct molecular biology experiments in the laboratory and encourage students to enter the lab experience.
After the students learned about the current situation, professor Liu introduced the history, background and main contents and rules of the iGEM competition.
After the explanation, many students have developed a strong interest, and asked questions to Liu Luo teacher for some details. The teacher answered with patience. In order to make the students more deeply understand the synthetic biology and iGEM, we don’t think it is enough to just listen to it after the discussion in the team. We hope that the students can practice it in depth to understand and use their creativity and imagination, so they are preaching. Before the meeting, we contacted the school and college leaders for their support and help. At the end of the presentation, we announced the Beijing Chemical Small “iGEM” competition to explain the competition awards and award requirements. Then we showed you the general progress of the competition and informed the students who are interested in the competition. The preliminary and rehearsal forms are screened in layers, and I hope that the students will participate in the competition with their own interests. At the end of the presentation, many students became interested in synthetic biology and iGEM competitions and started a lively discussion and team formation.
Beijing University of Chemical Technology "iGEM" Competition
After the end of the presentation, we organized the registration of the competition. Many students participated actively. In the end, 14 teams participated in the competition. Each team put forward their own ideas and ideas, and enriched by finding information and consulting teachers. Implement your own ideas and finally showcase their ideas through project books. According to the project book, we conducted the preliminary competition selection. We selected three teams to conduct the finals. The three teams conducted more in-depth practice and study.The three teams showed the PPT defense. I have my own job. Below is a brief introduction to the finals.
The school teacher announced the start of the game
Our captain announced the final team and the list of appearances  First team
Synthetic strain encryption based on CRISPRI    The DNA data storage technology is mainly used in their group projects. The division of labor in the experiment is reasonable, learning from each other and perfecting innovation is their driving force.      Second team
Conception of Yeast Genetic Engineering Bacteria in Antisepsis of Fruits and Vegetables    Their projects are close to life and can be used in knowledge  Third team
Study on dynamic regulation of laccase expression and apoptosis in seawater pollution by osmotic pressure receptors    They continue to polish themselves in failure, and finally set the best route, showing strong competitiveness.
Group photo after the game    All selection processes are reviewed by external experts by on-site recording.    The teacher concluded at the end that the competition “soft power” of the project itself should be improved accordingly, and innovative of the project is indispensable; the enthusiasm of the participants is inspiring, and the college will spare no effort to help them; The result is not important, stick to the end, and gain something in the game, is the real connotation of the event.
Harvest and experience
In fact, the final result is not so important. What is important is that the students have a deep understanding of synthetic biology, and through their spontaneous efforts, they have inspired their own creativity, exercised their abilities, and experienced the fun of science. For us, there are also unexpected gains. We learned different ideas from different teams through the competition. During the competition, we also had in-depth communication and learning with many teams. This is also a great improvement for our team. After learning about our validation experiments, they thought that our use of fluorescence as a standard for experimental quantification was not convincing. We should use multiple aspects of the data to characterize the functionality of our operons. Therefore, we characterize the sensitivity of the operator as a switch by three different concentrations of fatty acid content, fluorescence generation time and fluorescence content. What's more, the first team's strain encryption project is based on the problems that are learned from the side, and it is also practical, and also combines the experience of the teams with similar ideas in the previous iGEM competition. This also inspires us to think more about the possible contribution of our project to the future of human beings, and to learn more about the the meaning of human practice, the direction of our project's further in-depth.
