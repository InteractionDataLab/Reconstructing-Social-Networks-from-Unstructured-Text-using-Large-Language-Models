                        of Sciences. Hence, on a day of September we went to an Elementary school of Bordeaux to tell a class
                        of eight years old children about DNA. It took place in an whole afternoon.
                    </P><P>
                        In the first period we did a little intervention at the board about what is biology and what is considered as « life ». They
                        had trouble to consider microorganisms and plants as living organisms so the aim was to guide them
                        and popularize the words so they could understand the concepts better. We also told them about organs,
                        cells, DNA how they are linked and what makes them unique.
                    </P><P>
                        In a second time, we organized a little workshop to make doing a little experience with a DNA extraction of banana according
                        to the following protocol:</P><DIV style="display: table-cell;/*! clear: both; */"><OL style="margin-left: 25px !important;"><LI>First, the banana was mashed (half of banana is enough) so we mechanically broke the cells</LI><LI>Then we put one spoon of salt and three of detergent (washing-up liquid), so it dissolves the
                                lipids and plasmic membrane
                            </LI><LI>In a third time, we put five spoons of water to make the DNA cells dissolved themselves</LI><LI>Finally, we just filtered the mix, kept the filtrate and added a bit of methylated spirits. The
                                two liquids would not mix and the DNA compacted itself and to become clearly visible.</LI></OL></DIV><P> The experiment worked well and the children were glad to do something and to see a result.</P><P>To conclude the session we chose to tell them about the DNA code. To do that we organized a color game
                        where each color was corresponding to one amino acid base: red for A, blue for C, green for T, and
                        yellow for G. They had to identify their eyes and hair color and to translate that into the DNA language
                        Through all the afternoon we noticed that the children were very receptive to our intervention as
                        they had a lot of questions.</P><P>They wanted to know everything about about science and they were curious about us and what we know. It
                        was a really interesting experience for them and for us. The teachers were also very happy about
                        the afternoon and they invited us to come again any time!
                    </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="bg-white section-padding separator"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-12"><H2 class="section-title">Survey</H2><P>Part of our Human Practice work, we have established a little survey under the form of a mini quiz. It
                        aims to establish a state of knowledge regarding what people know about forest in general, and the
                        resulting industry. We diffused the survey to all IGEM teams contacted by social networks such as
                        Facebook and Twitter. As the objective was not to collect only igemers participation, we diffused
                        the survey among our university classmates, friends and family. The survey was available under both
                        English and French version. In that way we hoped to reach a maximum of people to establish a great
                        overview of the results.</P><H4>Survey structure</H4><P>The quiz has 8 questions with 3 answers and only one is correct. At the end of these questions the participant
                        must fill personal information fields in order to see who is participating. We asked for the age
                        group, the country of residency and if the player is participating to the current IGEM competition
                        or not. After sending his answers the player is assigned a mark on 8pts and he can consult a correction.</P><H4>Questions theme</H4><P>All questions refer to the concept of Forest in general and worldwide. Some were more oriented to how
                        the forest are used, and how they are managed. They are listed below:</P><OL style="font-size: 16px;"><LI>Approximately how much of the total forest represents the modified natural forests worldwide ?</LI><LI>Which country has the largest forested area ?</LI><LI>Which country generates the most industrial profit from its forests ?</LI><LI>What type of forest is the most represented in the world ?</LI><LI>How many people are employed in the forest trades ?</LI><LI>In Brazil, which activity is the most responsible in the reduction of forests ?</LI><LI>Which country is the leader in pulp and paper industry ?</LI><LI>Today, how are recycled sub-products from wood industry ?</LI></OL><H4>Results</H4><P>We collected a total of 127 answers. From these 127 participants, 60 are participating to the IGEM
                        competition which represents 47.2%. The average mark is 2.33/8. The proportion of correct answers
                        is visible on the histogram.
                    </P><P>The low average mark score is indicating a lake of knowledge in most of the questions. However, it is
                        not surprising to see such a fact as some of the questions were very specific. We can see that half
                        of the answers from question 4 are correct. At the opposite, only 15.2% of the answers from question
                        6 are correct. The little score for the question 6 highlights a weakness concerning the main reason
                        of the destruction of the biggest forest in the world; the Amazonian forest. It is surprising as
                        we know since years now that the Amazon Rainforest is being hurt and reduced in superficies every
                        year.
                        <FIGURE class="figure col-md-4 float-right"><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption" style="font-size: small">The age repartition of the participants is also significative with 80% of 18-25 years old range.
                                This is not surprising as we, in the team, are all from this age and diffused the survey
                                to our friends and colleagues.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></P><P>What is interesting for us is the result obtained for the final question. Only 30.4% of the answers are
                        correct. Most of the participants do not know how are recycled sub-products from the wood industry.
                        The correct answer is that sub-products from the wood industry are burnt to produce thermal energy.
                        However, the answers indicate that most of them think these sub-products are not recycled at all.</P><P>Regarding our project it is interesting to see that people are not aware of how forests are managed.
                        Hence, a large work of awareness, information and documentation needs to be done so people know the
                        potential of forest to maximize the benefits they already give us.</P><P>Thanks to the personal information field, it is interesting to see from where all the participants come
                        from. Most of them are from France. However, we collected answers from other European countries such
                        as Germany, England Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands. We also reached farer countries such
                        as Canada, USA, Algeria, but even India and Japan.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="bg-color1 section-padding separator"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-12" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"><H2 class="section-title">Interviews</H2><P>In the context of our project, we wondered about the impact of the competition and the opinion people

                        a teacher doing educational research and our IP. They gave us their point of view on iGEM, on what
                        it brings to a scientist, a teacher and also to students.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6 col-12"><H3>Denis Dupuy</H3><LABEL for="toggle">His biography</LABEL><A href="http://www.iecb.u-bordeaux.fr/teams/DUPUY/DupuylabSite/Welcome.html" style="color:white!important; border: 1px solid;

                                Axel did his PhD in structural biology at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of Prof. Tom Blundell (1998-2002).

                        From a pedagogical point of view iGEM makes some very important contributions:
                        </P><OL type="1"><LI>
                            It is an authentic research experience, meaning it is based on a real question, students design and perform their own experiments,
                            they interpret their results, they draw conclusions, it is open ended (they do not work for a
                            defined outcome), and importantly, their findings may have some societal impact. These features
                            drive students towards a mastery orientation, a goal orientation associated with deep learning
                            (a,d,f).
                        </LI><LI>
                            As a consequence, the project is motivating because it offers students a sense of autonomy, meaning that they have a high
                            level of control of what they are doing, they iGEM offers a great sense of agency. Because of
                            societal relevance and because of participation in a jamboree in Boston, this kind of project
                            boosts a sense of competence. The students feel useful; they realize that education is not just
                            to please the teacher with a good grade. And finally, because of an authentic experience and
                            because of a team- based activity, students have a great sense of relatedness, related to each
                            other, their supervisors and related to the discipline they have been studying for so long (d,f).
                        </LI><LI>   The beauty of iGEM is that it offers unique occasions for educational institutions to communicate their pedagogical activities.
                            As for scientific discoveries, universities must communicate about education, not just publishing
                            lists of course subjects to attract students. They must make education visible, tangible and
                            they must make it important.
                        </LI><LI>
                            Lastly, many studies have shown that iGEM-type of experiences connects students tightly with the educational institute and
                            this connection creates long lasting positive sentiments (b,c). Not only do positive sentiments
                            or, better, the lack of stress from frustration, stimulate the plasticity of our brain (e), which
                            makes the students more creative and productive, these sentiments also positively affect the
                            educational institution concerned. Besides an institutional salary, engaging and masterly-oriented
                            students are a key (motivational) reward for teachers who take their mission seriously.
