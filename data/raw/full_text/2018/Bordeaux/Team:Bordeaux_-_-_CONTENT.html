                    is one of the big current problem, mostly because it is mainly petrol-based.</P><P>This year our iGEM Bordeaux team aims to find a way to substitute an alternative segment of the traditional
                    petrobased chemistry by a new green bio-based chemistry.</P><P>The strategy is to focus on the bio-catalysis of the hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) in 2,5-furandicarboxylic
                    acid (FDCA). Usually, HMF is a product from petroleum. However, American chemist C.Zhang recently discovered
                    that it can be obtained from glucose, and now we know that it can come from any glucose-derived compound
                    too. Hence, HMF is a secondary product of the breakdown of sugars (fructose’s dehydration) and its oxidation
                    leads to the production of the FDCA molecule. This molecule is a really interesting product for green
                    chemistry because it can substitute Terephthalic Acid (PTA), used to do plastic bottles for example,
                    in the production of polyester.</P><P>Our project consists in HMF detoxification by using it as a substrate to produce FDCA through bacteria thanks
                    to 3 enzymes: HMFH, HMFO and ALDH1. These 3 enzymes have been cloned in a plasmid previous to be transformed
                    on E.Coli bacteria. Our current issues are to know how to be sure that FDCA has been well produced and
                    how to collect it. We also need to evaluate and establish the potential toxicity of HMF toward E.Coli.</P></DIV></DIV></SOURCE></VIDEO></DIV><DIV class="col-12 tiles subpanel" id="projectdescription"><P> Environmental issues are becoming increasingly important in our societies : waste, pollution, garbage…it feels like
