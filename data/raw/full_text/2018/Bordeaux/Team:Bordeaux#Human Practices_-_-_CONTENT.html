Indeed, this forest stands for the largest
            european forest. Despite its poor ground, it shelters a particular species of tree, able to colonize a challenging
            environment, called maritime pine (Pinus pinaster). It might be a true asset in the context of current climate
            changes. Besides its adaptability, the Landes forest also shows a strong resilience against natural disasters.</P><P>In order to ensure a sustained production of wood and a sustainable system, local players continuously think of directions
            concerning the cultivation of maritime pine and its transformation.</P><P>As our project aims to use coproducts of wood transformation, it was important for us to go out and meet those players
            so they can help us to better understand the needs and the socio-economic issues of the Landes forest.</P><OL><LI>The forest-based sector of the Landes Forest</LI><LI>Dialogue with Régis Pommier, a passionate man</LI><LI>Meeting with the competitiveness cluster Xylofutur</LI></OL></DIV><DIV class="bg-color2 section-padding separator"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-12"><H2 class="section-title">The forest-based sector of the Landes Forest</H2><P>Nowadays, the Landes forest is a major element of identity in our region Nouvelle Aquitaine. It stands
                        as the most productive forest in France with 26% of the national wood production. The local forest
                        production and transformation industry are the main source of income and they allow the sustainability
                        of the forest. Therefore, the future of the Landes forest can not be separated from wood economy.</P><H5 style="margin-top: 24px;">The maritime pine, the king of the Landes forest</H5><P>The maritime pine is not the only type of wood harvested in the region Nouvelle Aquitaine. We can find
                        other species such as oaks, chestnut trees and poplar among deciduous trees or spruce and douglas
                        firs among conifers. Here are few data illustrating how important the maritime pine is in our region
                        in 2018.</P><FIGURE class="figure col-lg-6" style="clear: both;margin-top: 15px;padding-left: 0px !important;padding-right: 0px !important;"><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption"><P style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; color: white; text-align: center">Nouvelle Aquitaine : Mémento régional

                        industrial wood and energy wood. One of the first steps in the lumber industry consist in sawing.
                        This step has the particularity to generate a very low yield of transformed wood over the initial
                        raw material. Indeed, this step generates up to 50% of by-products that have to be recovered through
                        other types of transformation such as panel, pulp and wood chemistry. In 2008, the FIBA (“Fédération
                        de l’Industrie des Bois d’Aquitaine”, a federation of wood industry of the former region Aquitaine
                        recently renamed “Nouvelle Aquitaine”) stated during a committee on the 5th of June that the yield
                        of the sawing step was then about 45%.

                        I2M institute (Institute of mechanics and engineering, in Bordeaux). Régis Pommier is a really passionate
                        man concerning the Landes forest and more generally concerning wood. He currently works on the recovery
                        of wood through collage techniques and wood drying. During our meeting, Regis Pommier enlightened
                        the sector’s challenges in the Landes forest.</P><H5>The Landes forest, a real industry</H5><P>During the exploitation of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) in the Landes forest, every piece of wood is
                        utilized. A real industry was built on this exploitation where every wood component is used for specific
                        purposes. Therefore, there are no “waste” strictly speaking in the Landes forest.</P><H5>Different applications depending on the life-stage of the tree</H5><P>The maritime pine is harvested all along its growth. Thinnings are led on young trees from 10 to 20 years-old.
                        The resulting wood will be transformed into pulpwood and firewood. Pulpwood is used by the paper
                        industry where it is converted into cellulose pulp. We can also manufacture particle boards from
                        this pulpwood. The remaining wood is used as firewood to produce energy.</P><P>
                        A 30 years-old tree is considered as an adult or mature tree. Its trunk base can be then utilized for “higher purpose” to
                        produce furnitures and constructions. The wood of the higher trunk is considered as less qualitative
                        as it contains more nodes. Therefore, it is more likely transformed to produce wooden pallets. The
                        high branches are converted again into pulpwood and firewood.</P><H5>A wood quality depending on soil</H5><P>Unlike deciduous trees (trees with broad leaves), the wood of resinous trees is more qualitative and
                        compact through a slow growth. Therefore, the quality of the wood decrease when the fertility of
                        the soil increase. Pines that are harvested on fertile soils are usually quickly cut down in order
                        to be transformed into wooden pallets and pulpwood.</P><H5>The sawing step, a low yield step</H5><P>The wood collected from the harvest of maritime pine is then routed to sawing workshops in order to produce
                        wooden planks. This step generates a very low yield with a great quantity of by-products (more than
                        30% of the raw material). These by-products are currently recovered as pulpwood or firewood.</P><H5>A future for the recovery of by-products</H5><P>Although there is a real and optimized industry in the Landes forest, it is actually important to boost
                        innovation in this field in order to enhance the recovery of generated by-products. One of the major
                        issues would be to achieve to handle a huge quantity of pulpwood in a high potential recovery process.
