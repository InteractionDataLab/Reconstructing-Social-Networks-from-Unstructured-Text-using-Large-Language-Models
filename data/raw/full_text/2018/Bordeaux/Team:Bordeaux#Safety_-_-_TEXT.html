Safety
Safety is our main concern at iGEM Bordeaux. We are committed to identify and manage risks involved by             our project. To reach this goal, we implemented containment practices and good laboratory practices in accordance             to practices already used in our laboratory. All of this must be performed in order to avoid any risks for lab workers and environment.
Members of the team who have worked in the lab received specific safety training by the lab staff. This training provided             basic information such as correct conduct to adopt in case of accident or fire including location of emergency             exits and safety showers.
Biologicals risks
Our project included no specific biological risks with the use of Escherichia coli strain DH5alpha classified as             a risk group 1 organisms. This strain do not cause any disease issue for a healthy adult. The only health issue             would be for immunosuppressed individual in case of ingestion. Another risk is the cross contamination             of common materials or other culture at the lab. Moreover, as we use genetic engineered organism with especially             antibiotic resistance gene, we need to avoid any environmental exposure to these organisms. In order to prevent             theses issues, we have implemented strictly containment practices such as the use of biosafety cabinet and specific             disposal for biological wastes. In case of development of our project at bigger scale, the containment of our engineered             E.coli will not be an issue as the biocatalysis of HMF in FDCA could happen in a closed bioreactor.
Chemical risks
The main risks involved by our project is the use of chemicals. The main risks are caused by the use of EtBr (Ethidium             bromide) which is carcinogen, and the use of HMF which can cause skin, eyes and respiratory irritation. The use of nitrile             gloves, protection glasses and lab coat is mandatory to prevent any contact. Since HMF is a powder, it is handled             under a laboratory fume hood to prevent respiratory exposure.
In order to implement an efficient safety policy into iGEM Bordeaux activities, we try to identify and assess every             risk involved by our project and to take all the measures needed to prevent any of this risk.
