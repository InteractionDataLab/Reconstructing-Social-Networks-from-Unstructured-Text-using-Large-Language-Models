Far Waste in the Landes forest
The Landes forest in our region of Nouvelle Aquitaine is the biggest artificial forest in Europe. The most                 common tree in this forest is the maritime pine which is an important tree accounting for 25 percent of the                 wood production in France. This wood production or other wood work brings many co-products like bark or sawdust;                 these co-products are well recycled but a part of this waste still remains. This wood waste represents a                 huge amount of biomass that could be used to produce many things.
We decided to focus on the transformation of this biomass into some building block, the 2,5-Furandicarboxylic                 acid (FDCA). A building block is a chemical that possesses some functional group allowing this molecule to                 be converted into a wide range of useful substances.
FDCA is an interesting building block because of its numerous uses; it can be used to produce biopolymers,                 that one may develop bioplastics for example,[1] but it also has great advantages in medicine as an anesthetic                 or even in the treatment of kidney stones [2]. FDCA have been ranked as the second most interesting bio based                 molecule by the Department Of Energy of the US just behind four carbon diacids [3].
Our main goal is to find a new way to produce this particular building block (FDCA) in order to reduce the use                 of oil which is currently the main source of building block. It could significantly prevent the pollution                 derived from the improper oil use.
The first part of our project is already performed in the industry in an environmentally sustainable way. The                 process corresponding to this first part is chemically made. Our main raw material is cellulose (coming from                 maritime pine) that we will use for our experiments. First of all, this cellulose will be broken down into                 glucose by acid hydrolysis, then this glucose will be isomerized into fructose and finally this fructose                 will be dehydrated into Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)[4].
The second part of our project, which is the conversion from HMF to FDCA is also done in the industry but is                 quite polluting, which is why we will use molecular biology to avoid this issue.
This process is based on the insertion of three different genes into E.coli to allow it to catalyze the transformation of HMF into FDCA. HMF is a toxic molecule and studies                 show that some strains are resistant to it and are able to transform HMF into FDCA. We choose three genes                 that are HmfH from C. basilensis [6], HmfO from P. putida [7] and Aldh1 from R. ornithinolytica [8]. This                 transformation is done in E. coli because it is a well-known bacterium and it also has a fast growth rate, allowing overnight cultures                 and genetic experimental results in mere hours.
These genes will perform the transformation of HMF into FDCA in two separated pathways : one for Aldh1 and one                 for HmfH that can be supported by HmfO which is an aspecific enzyme.
We will try many constructions with those genes to understand which one will demonstrate the best yield for the                 FDCA production. We will also try to improve these constructions, the proteins or even the strains in order                 to obtain a better yield, closer to the one obtained by chemical processes, but in a much more sustainable                 way.
