Environmental issues are becoming increasingly important in our societies : waste, pollution, garbage…it                     feels like we are running out of time without any viable solution. The lack of plastic waste recycling                     is one of the big current problem, mostly because it is mainly petrol-based.
This year our iGEM Bordeaux team aims to find a way to substitute an alternative segment of the traditional                     petrobased chemistry by a new green bio-based chemistry.
The strategy is to focus on the bio-catalysis of the hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) in 2,5-furandicarboxylic                     acid (FDCA). Usually, HMF is a product from petroleum. However, American chemist C.Zhang recently discovered                     that it can be obtained from glucose, and now we know that it can come from any glucose-derived compound                     too. Hence, HMF is a secondary product of the breakdown of sugars (fructose’s dehydration) and its oxidation                     leads to the production of the FDCA molecule. This molecule is a really interesting product for green                     chemistry because it can substitute Terephthalic Acid (PTA), used to do plastic bottles for example,                     in the production of polyester.
Our project consists in HMF detoxification by using it as a substrate to produce FDCA through bacteria thanks                     to 3 enzymes: HMFH, HMFO and ALDH1. These 3 enzymes have been cloned in a plasmid previous to be transformed                     on E.Coli bacteria. Our current issues are to know how to be sure that FDCA has been well produced and                     how to collect it. We also need to evaluate and establish the potential toxicity of HMF toward E.Coli.
