Education
For the Education engagement, we have chosen to go to meet children for sensibilizing them to the beauty                         of Sciences. Hence, on a day of September we went to an Elementary school of Bordeaux to tell a class                         of eight years old children about DNA. It took place in an whole afternoon.
In the first period we did a little intervention at the board about what is biology and what is considered as « life ». They                         had trouble to consider microorganisms and plants as living organisms so the aim was to guide them                         and popularize the words so they could understand the concepts better. We also told them about organs,                         cells, DNA how they are linked and what makes them unique.
In a second time, we organized a little workshop to make doing a little experience with a DNA extraction of banana according                         to the following protocol:
First, the banana was mashed (half of banana is enough) so we mechanically broke the cells
Then we put one spoon of salt and three of detergent (washing-up liquid), so it dissolves the                                 lipids and plasmic membrane
In a third time, we put five spoons of water to make the DNA cells dissolved themselves
Finally, we just filtered the mix, kept the filtrate and added a bit of methylated spirits. The                                 two liquids would not mix and the DNA compacted itself and to become clearly visible.
The experiment worked well and the children were glad to do something and to see a result.
To conclude the session we chose to tell them about the DNA code. To do that we organized a color game                         where each color was corresponding to one amino acid base: red for A, blue for C, green for T, and                         yellow for G. They had to identify their eyes and hair color and to translate that into the DNA language                         Through all the afternoon we noticed that the children were very receptive to our intervention as                         they had a lot of questions.
They wanted to know everything about about science and they were curious about us and what we know. It                         was a really interesting experience for them and for us. The teachers were also very happy about                         the afternoon and they invited us to come again any time!
Survey
Part of our Human Practice work, we have established a little survey under the form of a mini quiz. It                         aims to establish a state of knowledge regarding what people know about forest in general, and the                         resulting industry. We diffused the survey to all IGEM teams contacted by social networks such as                         Facebook and Twitter. As the objective was not to collect only igemers participation, we diffused                         the survey among our university classmates, friends and family. The survey was available under both                         English and French version. In that way we hoped to reach a maximum of people to establish a great                         overview of the results.
Survey structure
The quiz has 8 questions with 3 answers and only one is correct. At the end of these questions the participant                         must fill personal information fields in order to see who is participating. We asked for the age                         group, the country of residency and if the player is participating to the current IGEM competition                         or not. After sending his answers the player is assigned a mark on 8pts and he can consult a correction.
Questions theme
All questions refer to the concept of Forest in general and worldwide. Some were more oriented to how                         the forest are used, and how they are managed. They are listed below:
Approximately how much of the total forest represents the modified natural forests worldwide ?
Which country has the largest forested area ?
Which country generates the most industrial profit from its forests ?
What type of forest is the most represented in the world ?
How many people are employed in the forest trades ?
In Brazil, which activity is the most responsible in the reduction of forests ?
Which country is the leader in pulp and paper industry ?
Today, how are recycled sub-products from wood industry ?
Results
We collected a total of 127 answers. From these 127 participants, 60 are participating to the IGEM                         competition which represents 47.2%. The average mark is 2.33/8. The proportion of correct answers                         is visible on the histogram.
The low average mark score is indicating a lake of knowledge in most of the questions. However, it is not surprising to see such a fact as some of the questions were very specific. We can see that half                         of the answers from question 4 are correct. At the opposite, only 15.2% of the answers from question                         6 are correct. The little score for the question 6 highlights a weakness concerning the main reason                         of the destruction of the biggest forest in the world; the Amazonian forest. It is surprising as                         we know since years now that the Amazon Rainforest is being hurt and reduced in superficies every                         year.
The age repartition of the participants is also significative with 80% of 18-25 years old range.                                 This is not surprising as we, in the team, are all from this age and diffused the survey                                 to our friends and colleagues.
What is interesting for us is the result obtained for the final question. Only 30.4% of the answers are                         correct. Most of the participants do not know how are recycled sub-products from the wood industry.                         The correct answer is that sub-products from the wood industry are burnt to produce thermal energy.                         However, the answers indicate that most of them think these sub-products are not recycled at all.
Regarding our project it is interesting to see that people are not aware of how forests are managed.                         Hence, a large work of awareness, information and documentation needs to be done so people know the potential of forest to maximize the benefits they already give us.
Thanks to the personal information field, it is interesting to see from where all the participants come                         from. Most of them are from France. However, we collected answers from other European countries such                         as Germany, England Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands. We also reached farer countries such                         as Canada, USA, Algeria, but even India and Japan.
Interviews
In the context of our project, we wondered about the impact of the competition and the opinion people                         working at the university may have. We therefore asked three people about their opinion: a researcher,                         a teacher doing educational research and our IP. They gave us their point of view on iGEM, on what                         it brings to a scientist, a teacher and also to students.

Denis Dupuy did his graduate work in human genetics and molecular biology in the Gene Therapy and Molecular Pathology lab                                 under the supervision of Prof. B. Arveiler at the University of Bordeaux, France. His project                                 focused on the positional cloning of a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia in the vicinity                                 of the breakpoint of a chromosomal translocation associated with the disease. In the course                                 of this work, he benefited directly from the then ongoing efforts of the Human Genome Project,                                 which made him realize the importance of systematic approaches both as a complement to and                                 a resource for reductionist approaches. After receiving his doctoral degree, he joined Marc                                 Vidal’s lab at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA) for post-doctoral                                 training. In the Vidal lab, he developed the technological tools and strategies needed for                                 the systematic mapping of in vivo promoter activity in C. elegans. In September 2007, Denis                                 Dupuy joined the European Institute of Chemistry and Biology in Bordeaux, France as a group                                 leader to pursue the characterization of C. elegans gene regulation programs.

Axel did his PhD in structural biology at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of Prof. Tom Blundell (1998-2002).                                 He then joined the group of Dr. R. Sowdhamini at the National Centre for Biological Sciences                                 in Bangalore as a visiting fellow (2002-2004), where he developed a computational method                                 for identifying functionally important sites in proteins. Following his time in India, Axel                                 joined the laboratory of Prof. Thomas Steitz at Yale University (2004-2012). There, he chose                                 to tackle what was, at the time, a little-known form of translational control: the regulation                                 of ribosomal protein synthesis by the nascent polypeptide. He joined IECB as a group leader                                 in January 2013, was awarded the 2017 Coups d’Elan Prize for French Research from the Bettencourt-Schueller                                 Foundation and was selected as a 2017 EMBO Young Investigator. We interviewed him because                                 he took a particular interest in our project during our experimentation phase at the IECB.

From a pedagogical point of view iGEM makes some very important contributions:
It is an authentic research experience, meaning it is based on a real question, students design and perform their own experiments,                             they interpret their results, they draw conclusions, it is open ended (they do not work for a                             defined outcome), and importantly, their findings may have some societal impact. These features                             drive students towards a mastery orientation, a goal orientation associated with deep learning                             (a,d,f).
As a consequence, the project is motivating because it offers students a sense of autonomy, meaning that they have a high                             level of control of what they are doing, they iGEM offers a great sense of agency. Because of                             societal relevance and because of participation in a jamboree in Boston, this kind of project                             boosts a sense of competence. The students feel useful; they realize that education is not just                             to please the teacher with a good grade. And finally, because of an authentic experience and                             because of a team- based activity, students have a great sense of relatedness, related to each                             other, their supervisors and related to the discipline they have been studying for so long (d,f).
The beauty of iGEM is that it offers unique occasions for educational institutions to communicate their pedagogical activities.                             As for scientific discoveries, universities must communicate about education, not just publishing                             lists of course subjects to attract students. They must make education visible, tangible and                             they must make it important.
Lastly, many studies have shown that iGEM-type of experiences connects students tightly with the educational institute and                             this connection creates long lasting positive sentiments (b,c). Not only do positive sentiments                             or, better, the lack of stress from frustration, stimulate the plasticity of our brain (e), which                             makes the students more creative and productive, these sentiments also positively affect the                             educational institution concerned. Besides an institutional salary, engaging and masterly-oriented                             students are a key (motivational) reward for teachers who take their mission seriously.

Conferences and Debates
The 29th May, 2018, we organized a series of talks on the theme of ethics in science and potential                         misuse of biological research. These talks were open to public but we focused on biological student                         in order to increase awareness for future researchers and engineers.
The first speech was given by Mr. Marc Mainguené in the name of the foundation Anthony Mainguené who                         aim to arise ethical consciousness in the society and promote new ethical behavior especially in management. Mr. Mainguené gave us philosophical definition of ethic and an overview of development                         axis in order to promote ethical way to lead project by forecasting impact on society and integrate                         project among stakeholder. See more at http://www.fondation-anthonymainguene.org/
The second talk was given by Mr. Patrice Binder, expert in biosecurity specialized in the issue of dual                         use of biotechnologies and biological weapons proliferation. During his talk Mr Binder gave us specific                         and detailed case of misuse of biological research for biological weapon production. This speech                         allowed us to better understand potential risks associated with any synthetic biology project.
All thoses talks, along with the discussion that we had with each of them, allowed us to understand the                         stakes that comes with the creation of any synthetic biology project like iGEM. It was very interesting                         to hear many differents perspective and we hope this knowledge about ethics will help us to lead                         our projects better in the future and maybe to be some slightly better scientists.
