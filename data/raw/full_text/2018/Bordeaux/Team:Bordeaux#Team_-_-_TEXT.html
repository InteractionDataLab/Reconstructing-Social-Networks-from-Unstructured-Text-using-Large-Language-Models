We are IGEM Bordeaux 2018
Among the 56000 student-trees of the University of Bordeaux was living 17 motivated and ambitious young-trees. All scattered                 into the green mass, they reunited on this day of November 2017 to learn more about the iGEM competition.                 Their wise predecessors told them the adventure they lived last year. Envious and dreamers, they decided                 to take up the challenge too. Our 17 trees come from different horizons, with different backgrounds and future                 perspectives but they are all reunited by the desire to expand their branches of knowledge. As the time passed,                 only the trees with very resistant roots survived to the “let it go” storm. After that our 17 young little                 trees were reunited to form a stronger gathering ready to start the competition.

Denis
The bonsai
He is in some sort the founder father of the forest. He is nothing less than a researcher officer at the National Institute                             of Health and Medical Research (INSEREM). It is him who sowed the seeds since 6 years now, and                             watch them to grow until the Jamboree.
Marguerite
The ginkgo
She is a first year Plant Biotechnology Masters student. This ancestral tree is very powerful. Indeed, she is both president                                         of the team, and in charge of the Human practice pole. It is good to have a ginkgo around it brings many health benefits.
Yasmine
The fir
She graduated this year with a Bachelor in Molecular and Cellular Biology. She is our team leader and has to coordinate all                                         the progresses from the different poles. In addition she is at the head of the thorny                                         Scientific pole to organize and motivate the lab work. Her needles shelter someone                                         who loves to escape the everyday grind by traveling or having deep readings.
Ines
The cherry tree
She is a first year bioinformatics Master student. In charge of the Communication pole, her aim is to make shining the team                                         as much as her flowers in lovely day of spring.
Pierre
The stick insect
He is a first year Bioinformatics Masters student. Passionate about computing, he delved the topic until to perfectly match                                         to it. Most of the time he hides behind a screen to code and build the wiki.
Lorine
The eucalyptus
She graduated this year with a Bachelor in Molecular and Cellular Biology. She is not from Australia but her determination is from the same size. She leads the wiki construction, et make sure everything is                                         written on time. This tree needs a minimum of sun each day.
David
The oak
He graduated this year with a Bachelor in Molecular and Cellular Biology. His branches are active in the scientific pole.                                         Caution, this tree is robust and cannot be grown inside.
Estelle
The olive tree
She graduated of a Master in genetics. From the Southern of France, this mediterranean tree participates to the competition                                         for the second time. After squeezing her fruits you obtain an intersting oil rich                                         in laugh, travel and science fiction.
Thomas
The Japenese Maple
He graduated this year of a Biotechnology Engineering School. Symbol of ideas communication, he is at the head of the partnerships                                         and funding pole. He participates to the competition for the second time, therefore                                         this tree is always here to give an attentive leaf to the needs of the team.
François
The poplar
He graduated this year with a Bachelor degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology. This tree is tall such as his implication                                         in the work lab for iGEM. A healthy mind in a healthy trunk is his motto.
Maëlle
The maple
She is in third year of Biotech Engineering School. She takes part of the iGEM lab experiments. Some other trees reported                                         she regularly use 5mL propipette to share her mapple syrup.
Sandro
The weeping willow
He graduated this year with a Bachelor in Cells and Organisms Biology. Apparently he did not whimper to participate to the                                         iGEM lab work, and he is not wailing neither during his working time.
Jean Clément
The pine
He graduated this year in Biology of Cells and Organisms. He grows straight up, like a rocket that wants to discover the                                         world.
Frederic
The linden
He is a first year Bioinformatics Masters student. Curious about new technology he planned to build an algorithm to calculate                                         the exact time needed for a perfect infusion.
Anaïs
The cocoa tree
She graduated with a Bachelor in Cells and Organisms Biology. Very coveted for her fruits. Well managed and processed you                                         can extract from her a piece of heaven
Arthur
The pistachio
He graduated this year with a Bachelor in Molecular and Cellular Biology. His green ideas intermingle music, DIY, and computer                                         science. All in one shell.
Sebastien
The catalpa
He is a first year Bioinformatics Master student. Hiding in the shadow, he is here to support the Bioinformatic team of Bordeaux.                                         Ready to respond for any computing matters, his mind will always respond to the call                                         of programming.
