The IGEM Bordeaux team is responsible for all the aspects of running the project. From the reflection of the subject,             to the writing of the protocols, setting them up, finding sponsors and promote our subject among a large and             diversified public. We also carried out all the writing and and all the computer part of the development of the             Wiki. The tasks were split as below:
Lab Work
Team
Yasmine Amrani, supervised the lab work. Arthur Grimaud and Sandro Papaïs designed the experiments and the parts used for the lab work. Sandro Papaïs, François Hebrard and Maëlle Allender, accomplished the lab work by themselves. They also wrote their own experiment                             protocols with the help of David Mauboules. Finally, Maëlle Allender did the experiments regarding the chemistry part.
External Help
Thanks to the European Institute of Chemistry and Biology (IECB) and the Laboratory of Chemistry                             of Organic Polymers (LCPO) of Bordeaux for lending us their premises. Denis Dupuy and Delphine Daguerre who supervised our trainees for the lab work in the IECB and Stéphane Grelier and Eric Virol in the LCPO. Florian Alonso (CRTCB - U1045) and Thierry Dakhli for their help and advices to understand our mistakes and use them to carry                             out our progress.
Sponsoring
Thomas Favraud, Marguerite Batsale, Ines Baghou, were responsible for finding sponsors and building application files. Lorine Debande has set up our crowdfunding campaign.
Human Practices
Team
Our human practice work has been rich and diversified. Thus, we were all involved in some aspect                             of it.
Each conference has succeeded thanks to the coordination of all of us. Marguerite Batsale, Thomas Favraud, Yasmine Amrani and Jean-Clément Gallardo were greatly active for finding and inviting our speakers. Frederic Jung was responsible to find premises for hosting each event. They were diffused                             with posters and flyers designed by Pierre Jacquet, Marguerite Batsale, Thomas Favraud, and Francois Hebrard .
The interviews to the Landes forest actors were carried out by Marguerite Batsale . The scientific workshops for children were designed by Anaïs Labecot and took place with the help of Pierre Jacquet, Marguerite Batsale, David Mauboules, and Maëlle Allender. The survey we have held came from an idea of Yasmine Amrani and Lorine Debande. It was thus designed and analyzed by Ines Baghou.

Stephane Grelier, University lecturer at the University of Bordeaux.
They all took part to our events aiming to diffuse, talk, and exchange about Science. They                                     shared their knowledge and brought reflexions among their public.
Collaborations
Our collaborative projects have involved the organization and the lodging of our collaborators.                             Beside the academic work to perform we had at heart to welcome them properly and make them a                             good time so they keep of this collab a good memory. To do this, thank you to Jean-Clément Gallardo, Anaïs Labecot, Arthur Grimaud, Sandro Papaïs , Ines Baghou and David Mauboules. They have been good for both working IGEM and having fun.
Meetups
The meetups are important events for the team. It permits to build a network, exchange with other                             igemers, training for presentations and finally increase our visibility. Most of them were far                             from our hometown but some of us took the time to travel to it. Yasmine Amrani, Lorine Debande, Jean-Clément Gallardo, Anaïs Labecot, François Hebrard , Estelles Lesbros and David Mauboules did their best to proudly represent our team abroad.
Communication
Communication is essential for the visibility and the credibility of the team. Ines Baghou was in charge to manage our Facebook page and Twitter account, helped along with Estelle Lebros. Lorine Debande designed our booklet used for finding sponsors by presenting us in a good                             form. To complete this task she also designed business cards to spread all around.
Wiki
Each of us had a specific chapter to write, therefore we were all involved in the writing of the                             Wiki. The video clip presentation of our supervisor was filmed by Sandro Papais and animated by Yasmine Amrani. The computer building part was managed by Pierre Jacquet and Sebastien Goncalves Claro. Pierre Jacquet designed a new logo used to represents the team.
