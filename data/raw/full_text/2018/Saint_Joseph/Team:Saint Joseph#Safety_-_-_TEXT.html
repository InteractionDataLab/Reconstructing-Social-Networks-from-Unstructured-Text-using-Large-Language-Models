Safety features of our project design
If our project is implemented in real-life aquaculture farms, our phages will have their built-in kill switches which might activate according to salt concentration differences.
Safety throughout the lab
-During the experiments all team members wore lab-coats.
-Everyhting was handled while wearing gloves.
-All lab equipment used for bacteria growth were sterilized carefully.
-Any equipment which came in contact with ethidium bromide was rinsed, and the water detoxified.
-All ethidium bromide waste was disposed of in sealed containers or in specific bins.
