We would like to thank everybody who helped us in this journey. We wouldn't be here without your contributions.
Preparation Support

taught us essential synthetic biology terms and notions as we lacked the knowledge needed for this competition since we are a high school team. (Istanbul University - Faculty of Science, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics)
Ikbal Agah Ince
helped us initiate the project. Without his experiences and his leadership skills, we wouldn't have been able to participate in this competiton. He took us under his wing as a team. He also helped us with notions and iGEM related questions.He was also one of our biggest sponsors during our InterLab experiences. He is also our PI.

He was very patient with us and he taught us everything we know about the lab we worked in as it was quite an advanced lab. We could do our InterLab studies thanks to his professional dedication for his job and his students.
