The 2018 iGEM McMaster Team
Welcome to the team page for McMaster University iGEM 2018. We are a passionate team made up of different programs such as Health Sciences, Biochemistry, Engineering and more! Here is our team picture that includes almost the full team. Our main team is subdivided into three smaller teams each with a different focus. These are the Wet Lab Team working in the lab with conducting the actual next generation sequencing (NGS), the Dry Lab Team who is writing code to analyze NGS data provided from Wet Lab, and the Human Practices Team who is attempting to increase public awareness about NGS and how it can be used to in disease research.
Meet the Team Members!
