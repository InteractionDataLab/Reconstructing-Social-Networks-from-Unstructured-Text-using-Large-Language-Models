This year, iGEM McMaster has had the pleasure of being able to collaborate with a number of different iGEM teams. Here are some of our highlights from this year.
The oGEM Conference
The Ontario Genetically Engineered Machine Network (oGEM) Conference is an annual event that brings iGEM teams from across the province of Ontario, Canada together to discuss their research projects, initiate collaborations, and hold discourse on both the successes and challenges of synthetic biology research. This year, we had the pleasure of planning and hosting this annual event at McMaster University, bringing together the iGEM teams from Univeristy of Toronto , Queen's University , University of Guelph , University of Ottawa , University of Waterloo , and Brock University , as well as hosting Western University's Synthetic Biology group. There, we also had the fortune of having Dr. Benjamin Scott, Synbio Canada President and iGEM alumnus, come to speak to us about his research in synthetic biology. Additionally, we introduced a student SynBio roundtable discussion session in response to the discussion paper published following the first National Synthetic Biology Conference here in Canada.

University of Waterloo
Throughout the year, we also had a mutually beneficial advisory relationship with the iGEM Waterloo team. Specifically, we met with Clara Fikry from the team several times early in calendar year to discuss the projects we were considering undertaking and the paths that we would take to do so. Through much discussion and meetings between the teams, we were able to share feedback and learn from each other. Additionally, Max Reed, a member from Waterloo who had led their amyloid-related iGEM project last year, took the time to speak to us as we are looking at amyloid-beta. We discussed how to obtain bacterial growth curves, which medium to use for best resuults, amyloid protein overexpression, and inclusion body formation. Last, but not least, the Waterloo team was kind enough to provide us with the required E. coli DH5-alpha cells for the Interlab study so that we could meet its second requirement.

OUC China Collab
McMaster iGEM also forged a connection with the OUC China team. OUC has created a comic book that is both informative and accessible, by creatively explaining concepts such as transcription and promoters, in order to extend the field of synthetic biology to a younger audience. Our team assisted OUC in translating the comic book into Portuguese to assist them in extending their reach with this unique initiative.
