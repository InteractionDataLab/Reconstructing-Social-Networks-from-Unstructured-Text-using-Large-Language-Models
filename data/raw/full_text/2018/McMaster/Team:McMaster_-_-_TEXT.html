Wet Lab
Our project this year was to express human amyloid beta protein variants  in E. coli as a system for studying the molecular basis of aggregation. This research will contribute to our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.
Human Practices
By interviewing physicians, educators, and community members, the Human Practices subteam was able to understand Alzheimer's disease from many different perspectives. We are showcasing what we've learned through an educational video aimed to increase public knowledge and destigmatize those living with Alzheimer's.
Dry Lab
The Dry Lab will be supporting the Wet Lab to develop an algorithm for NGS data analysis and modelling. We will also be collaborating with the Human Practices team to create a NGS video game.
The Team
From our members to our sponsors and all those have helped us along the way, nothing would have been accomplished without our team. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts.
