NGS Paper
Isaac Newton is famously attributed with the quote, “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants,” which exemplifies the intention behind our NGS paper — to show how modern gene sequencing technology is the result of a history of building on other’s progress. The NGS paper was a collaborative research document created by the Human Practices team to better understand the history and current applications of next-generation sequencing technologies. This paper helped guide the work of both the Wet Lab and Dry Lab: the wet lab received insight as to what merits NGS has compared to other sequencing technologies, and the dry lab learned how NGS operates through a visual depiction of NGS included in our paper. Each member of our team researched one aspect of NGS and was tasked with sharing a key article, as well as reading someone else’s article. This overlap in research allowed us not only to corroborate another person’s conclusions during our discussion period, but also allowed us to form unique perspectives from synthesizing two ways of approaching NGS as a big idea. This process helped each of our members develop a strong understanding of everyone’s research.
