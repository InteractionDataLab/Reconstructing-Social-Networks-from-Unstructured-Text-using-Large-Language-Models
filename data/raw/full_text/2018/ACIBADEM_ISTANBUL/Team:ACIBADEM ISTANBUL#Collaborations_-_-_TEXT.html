Saint-Joseph InterLab Collabration
Saint – Joseph
Whilst making the necessary preparations to complete the InterLab study, we were approached by the Saint-Joseph team to collaborate together. We agreed. This is what we accomplished:
1. A, “Safety in the workplace” talk was given to both teams by our Secondary Principal Investigator (PI) Ali Adem Bahar.
2. We  provided a, “Lab techniques and Training session” where we taught them about:
2.1. The Pipettor: What it is and how to properly use it.
2.2. Proper glove sizes, wearing and removal.
2.3. Formal lab wear.
2.4. Lab rules
2.5. The Do’s and Don’ts in the lab bench.
3. (Calibration 1) LUDOX Protocol : We kept both teams iGEM DNA distribution kit safe in our lab, Ince Lab, located in Acibadem University, General Research Lab, Bench 1; Section 3.
3.1. We provided Saint-Joseph with ddH20 and the black sided, clear bottom 96 well plate to be used in the experiment.
3.2. We taught them how to use the Spectrophotometer in our lab (Varioskan LUX multimode microplate reader).
3.3. A meeting was called after in which the data from both teams were evaluated.
4. (Calibration 2) Particle Standard Curve – Microsphere Protocol
4.1 ACIBADEM_ISTANBUL provided Saint-Joseph with the ddH2O, Eppendorf tubes and Vortex machine to complete the microsphere protocol.
4.2 ACIBADEM_ISTANBUL oversaw Saint_Joseph’s serial dilution and pipetting procedures to ensure proper technique.
4.3 Spectrophotometric analysis was executed by ACIBADEM_ISTANBUL for both teams.
4.4 A meeting was called after in which the data from both teams were evaluated.
5. (Calibration 3) Fluorescence standard curve – Fluorescein Protocol
5.1 ACIBADEM_ISTANBUL prepared the 1x PBS for use by both teams.
5.2 ACIBADEM_ISTANBUL oversaw Saint_Joseph’s serial dilution and pipetting procedures to ensure proper technique.
5.3 Spectrophotometric analysis was executed by ACIBADEM_ISTANBUL for both teams
5.4 A meeting was called after in which the data from both teams were evaluated.
6. (Calibration 4) Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E.coli cultures.
6.1 DH5-alpha cells were streaked by ACIBADEM_ISTANBUL for use by both teams.
6.2 Competent cells were prepared by ACIBADEM_ISTANBUL for use by both teams.
6.3 LB media was prepared by ACIBADEM_ISTANBUL for use by both teams.
6.4 CCMB80 buffer was prepared by ACIBADEM_ISTANBUL for use by both teams.
6.5 SOC media was prepared by ACIBADEM_ISTANBUL for use by both teams.
6.6 SOC agar was prepared by ACIBADEM_ISTANBUL for use by both teams.
6.7 SOB medium was prepared by ACIBADEM_ISTANBUL for use by both teams.
6.8 Chloramphenicol was supplied by ACIBADEM_ISTANBUL for use by both teams.
6.9A meeting was called at the end of the day to compare and discuss results.
Biobrick Collabration
Provided our Biobrick registry to UESTC-Software to help refine their BioBrick database.
Ankara Meet Up
We attended the Bilkent organized iGEM Ankara meetup, where we each had the opportunity to present our projects to the other Turkish iGEM teams; Bilkent, METU and Saint-Joseph.
We used this opportunity to evaluate each other’s projects and make recommendations.
Furthermore, we took advantage of this opportunity to assess how our project stands from an outsiders perspective and improve on any weaknesses that we might have otherwise missed.
METU-High Scholl
METU-HS reached out to us for a chance to collaborate. Our very own Atabey Unlu used the Monod Kinetics and Curve Fitting Tool in MathWorks for various Bacterial growth calculations.
