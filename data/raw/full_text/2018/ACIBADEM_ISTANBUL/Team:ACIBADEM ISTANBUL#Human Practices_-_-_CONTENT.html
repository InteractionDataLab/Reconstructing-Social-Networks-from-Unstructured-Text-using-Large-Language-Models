Every year an estimated <STRONG>two million people</STRONG> are bitten by venomous snakes. 
Of those, over <STRONG>100,000 people die</STRONG>.
For those whom survive, <STRONG>over 400,000 of them are left with a permanent disability</STRONG>.

Whilst LTNF 2.0 cannot decrease the number of annual snake bites, we are hoping to decrease the current morbidity/mortality status by offering a high efficacy, readily available and safe anti-venom for rapid use in snake endemic regions of the world.</SECTION></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV id="Price"><H2>Cost</H2><TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5"><TBODY><TR><TD><SECTION>Average price of a single dose of anti-venom is <STRONG>$1,500 - $2,000</STRONG>.
An average of 20-25 doses of anti-venom are required to treat a single snake bite.
As a result, the average price of treatment a single snake bite costs over <STRONG>$30,000</STRONG> in pharmaceutical costs alone.
The estimated cost of producing industry-scale LTNF 2.0 via fermentation is <STRONG>$5-6 per gram</STRONG>.
The target market mainly consists of developing countries in the South Asia and Africa region, that not only have the highest relative incidence of snake bites, but also limited healthcare budgets.
Providing a cost-effective solution to the world’s anti-venom problem allows for developing countries to be able to afford and meet their anti-venom needs. 
This ultimately leads to countries being able to reserve funds for other major healthcare problems while also increasing the success rate for anti-venom treatment.</SECTION></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV id="No"><H2>Safety</H2><TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5"><TBODY><TR><TD><SECTION><STRONG>Over 43% of patients</STRONG> injected with animal produced anti-venom express <STRONG>Severe Type I Hypersensitivity</STRONG> reactions due to cross-reaction.

LTNF 2.0 takes a biochemical approach, inhibiting the major enzymes that make up the venom.
Therefore, LTNF 2.0 can theoretically inhibit other anti-venoms that utilize similar enzymes for the same hemotoxic effect.

Self-Administration of LTNF 2.0 for empiric therapy will be very easy thanks to our partnership with Ypsomed, which has offered us early access to their LyoTwist Trio dual-chambered auto-injector.
After getting bit by the snake, a simple two-step process allows for the administration of LTNF 2.0:</SECTION><SECTION style="margin-left: 50px"><STRONG>1)</STRONG> Mix and Prime the Lyophilized LTNF 2.0 with sterile saline.<STRONG> 2)</STRONG> Inject the mixture near site of injury.</SECTION><SECTION>The device uses an auto-inject mechanism that makes self-administration very easy.
The device is compact in size, which allows it to be carried easily by anyone, anywhere. </SECTION><STRONG>Calmette Loops</STRONG><SECTION>The modifications made to develop LTNF 2.0 has provided LTNF with greater stability and lower hemotoxicity, we can consider using it for prophylaxis for residents of snake endemic regions. 
Given how our industrialization process comprises of utilizing yeast, we could even go far as to offering the LTNF 2.0 in products such as yogurt and cereals, to be consumed before venturing outside that day.</SECTION><STRONG>Lyophilized Vial</STRONG><SECTION>LTNF 2.0 can be sold to Health centers in the form of  lyophilized vials, to be injected into IV drips in either ambulance and hospital conditions.</SECTION></DIV><DIV id="Distrub"><H2>Disruption of industry </H2><SECTION>The world’s first anti-venom was made in 1895 by Albert Calmette, using a long and taxing process of abusing animals as antibody generators.
