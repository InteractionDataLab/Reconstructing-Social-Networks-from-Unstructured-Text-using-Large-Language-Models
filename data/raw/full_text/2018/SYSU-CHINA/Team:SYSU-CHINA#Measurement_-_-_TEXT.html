This year, SYSU-CHINA developed a reversible safe switch for CAR T therapy based on the tet-inducible CMV promoter and U24 protein of        Human Herpesvirus 6. Since our project relies heavily on the regulatory function of the tet-ON promoter, a major part of our project        is to characterize the properties of it. Its response to different concentration of doxycycline, a small molecule drug approved by        FDA, and the kinetics of expression upon induction can be vital to further develop effective treatment for the adverse effects of CAR        T therapies.         In order to achieve such goal, we employed different methods to measure the promoter's dose-dependent response and its expression        kinetics under optimal drug concentration, including fluorescence intensity measurement using microscopy, western blots and flow        cytometry. We also characterized our circuits in two different chassis, HEK-293T cell lines and Jurkat leukemia cell lines. Some of        our data was shown below.

A: Fluorescence images of HEK293T cells transfected with pEF1a-GFP-T2A-U24 or transfected with ptetON-GFP-T2A-U24 and treated with     different concentration of Dox, ranging from 0 ng/ml to 600 ng/ml.
B: Relative fluorescence intensity of the images in A(3 replicates, data not show) after analyzed by ImageJ.
C: Western blot result of the cells harvested in A.
D: Normalized protein level of the images in C after analyzed by ImageJ.

Unlike measurement using bacteria, measurement experiments done with mammalian cells are more likely to have a broader variation and        sometimes inconsistent results. Several factors may contribute to the variation, including varying transfection efficiency from        sample to sample and intrinsic cell-to-cell variation. As shown in our flow cytometry result, only a small fraction of cells        exhibited elevated GFP fluorescence intensity, indicating a low transfection efficiency. A large number of untransfected cells may        therefore mask the actual results. Thus we recommend using single cell anaylsis for mammalian cells measurements, or establish a        stable cell lines, preferably from a single colony.

This figure shows the distribution of fluorescence intensity of GFP, which reflect the expression level of U24. The red line is the     sample001, stands for untransfected HEK293T cells(unstained), as control. The blue one is the sample010, stands for HEK293T cells     transfected with pEF1a-CAR and ptetON-GFP-T2A-U24. The orange one is the sample011, stands for HEK293T cells transfected with pEF1a-CAR     and ptetON-GFP-T2A-U24, treated with Dox. 10,000 cells are analyzed.
In addition, we tested a new universal method to detect surface chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) expression. The method utilizes the        binding property of protein L to light kappa chain in immunoglobulins, which also presents in the scFv domain of CARs. By staining        cells with biotin-protein L and R-phycoerythrin(PE)-conjugated streptavidin, we can detect surface CAR expression.
In summary, our work provided data from first-hand experience for one of the most widely-used regulatory promoters in mammalian cell        lines, which can bring benefits to teams in the future who are eager to use this promoter. In addition, we performed measurement        experiments with mammalian cells using different methods. The experience may provide insights for teams in the future to better        conduct measurement on mammalian cells.
