Tao Yu
Student leader. A person who lacks sleep and money during iGEM competition,
Mao Xiaowen
Student leader. Soul of the team.
Zhu Hongyi
Major in chemical biology, love to explore the world!
Tao Kehan
This man is a realistic example of the surrealism.
Ruan Shaolin
I performed the cellular experiments including cell culture (cell maintaining, cryopreservation and thawing), virus packing               and infection (plasmid extraction and transfection, virus harvest and virus concentration), and flow cytometry (experiment               design, sample preparation, data analysis and operation of the flow cytometer).
Gao Menghan
I'm a senior student majored in biotechnology. InterLab, Human Practice and Wiki editing are my main tasks. It is really a               fantastic experience in my college life to participate in iGEM. Besides being an enthusiastic researcher, I am also an amateur               Latin dancer and platform diver.
Tan Tianhao
Shut up and calculate!

A classical OTAKU; A true Miku fan, A man who above vulgar interests.
Wang Lin
Hi,I'm WangLin from Sun Yat-sen University. Participating in iGEM is a valuable memory for me. Although we experienced many               magical experimental failures, we finally made the results! Our project is as interesting as it's name! By the way, Mozart-              L'opera Rock is really great, I made a lot of experiments while listening to their songs.
Dr. Huang Junjiu
Stem Cell and Functional Genomics Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University
Primary PI
A major area of Dr. Huang's interest is how stem cells keep themselves renewal and what factors can induce stem cells               differentiation specially. Last year, he was elected the Nature 2015 the world's ten largest scientific figures.
Dr. Liu Feng
School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University.
Secondary PI
Dr. Liu's research interests are molecular mechanism of organismal aging and cellular senescence.
