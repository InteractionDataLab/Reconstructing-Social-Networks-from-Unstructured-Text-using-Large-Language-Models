Our work and results for InterLab measurement
Introduction
The past interlaboratory studies have established a baseline for replicability of fluorescence measurements and identified likely key        sources of error, which have now been published [1], under review, or in preparation.
The goal for the fifth InterLab is to correct systematic variability, in order to achieve the InterLab protocol's full potential as        an engineering discipline. Our team members are excited to participate in the InterLab Study, trying our utmost to provide data        helping answer the question: can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count        or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD?
During the experiment, we carefully followed the Plate Reader and CFU protocol. After days of hard work, our data and forms are        completed and have been accepted by the 2018 Measurement Committee.
Materials and Methods
The measurement was done by carefully following the Plate Reader Protocol from        https://2018.igem.org/Measurement/InterLab/Plate_Reader.
Materials
InterLab Measurement Kit
Eight devices to be tested:
Negative Control (BBa_R0040)
Positive Control (BBa_I20270)
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000)
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001)
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002)
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364007)
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364008)
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364009)
Bacteria strain: Escherichia coli DH5-α
LB medium with Chloramphenicol(25ug/mL)
Plate reader: BioTek® Synergy H1
Black 96 well plate with flat, transparent bottom
Methods
OD600 Reference Point
OD600 reference point was obtained by measuring the Abs600 of H2O and LUDOX CL-X from InterLab Measurement Kit, followed by data        processing.
Particle Standard Curve
Particle standard curve was obtained by serial dilution of the monodisperse silica microspheres followed by measurements using plate        reader.
Fluorescein Standard Curve
Fluorescein standard curve was obtained by serial dilution of the fluorescein solution followed by measurements using plate reader.
Cell Measurements
Plasmids of each device was re-suspended from Distribution Kit and used to transform Escherichia coli DH5-α. 2 colonies from each        plate was picked and inoculated in 5ml LB medium with Chloramphenicol. The overnight cultures were each diluted to a target OD600 of        0.02 in 12ml LB medium. The diluted cultures were incubated at 37℃ and sampled at 0 and 6 hours post incubation. The OD600 and        fluorescence intensity was measured at each time point.
Results and Discussion
1.Standard Curve
Following the dilution way in protocol, we got perfect particle standard curve and fluorescence standard curve. These two standard        curves actually provide solid foundation for our further experiment.

2.Cell Measurements
2.1OD600 Measurements
The following graph shows the OD600 of each device at two time points. All the samples grow with a similar trend. There's no        significant difference among each sample's OD600 value increase.

2.2Fluorescence measurements
The following graph shows the fluorescence intensity of each device at each time point. The fluorescence of Positive Control, Test        Device 2 and Test Device 4 grow stronger obviously after 6 hours, while others' fluorescence levels only have minor changes or        maintain the original level. These differences may be caused by diverse promoter or RBS in each device.

Experience with the InterLab
During the experiment, we observed that the OD600 values and fluorescent levels of samples could change significantly after standing        for 20min or longer time. We speculate that the deviation of test results may be caused by bacterial cell growth or deposition or        some other unknown reasons. Therefore, a timely sample measurement is pretty pivotal to the success of the experiment.
The time delay always happens when the testing instrument has not been adjusted before or the instrument is being occupied by other        students. According to our experience, we hold that it is necessary to emphasize the importance of the measurements timeliness in the        next-year InterLab protocol.
