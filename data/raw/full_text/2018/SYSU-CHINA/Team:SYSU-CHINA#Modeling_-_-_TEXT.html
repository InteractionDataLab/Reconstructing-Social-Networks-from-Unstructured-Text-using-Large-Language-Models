Dynamic mode diagram
After reading literatures,we chose a model called "separation model" to describe the behavior of TCR and CAR during the immunization process.The main content of this model is that larger phosphatases will be "squeezed" out of the immune synapse to form a kinase-rich domain(KRD) during the process of T cells approaching the target cell and forming an immune synapse,T cell receptors that bind to pMHCs will undergo a series of phosphorylation and initiate downstream pathways by recruiting molecules such as ZAP70.In the original text of Burroughs,this process is described by a simplified exponential function.After reference to the dynamic proofreading model,we made a dynamic mode diagram of CAR phosphorylation.
According to the diagram of CAR phosphorylation and the law of mass action,we list a series of ordinary differential equations(ODE) to describe phosphorylation and use the density of the three-phosphorylated receptor(A3) as an indicator of signal intensity.Since the ordinary differential equations have no analytical solution,we adopt two approaches to solve this problem.
Numerical Solution
Using Matlab,we get the numerical solution of the system of ODEs.It can be seen that the density of free receptor in the KRD drop to near 0.The tertiary phosphorylated receptors gradually increased and eventually almost all of the receptors were phosphorylated.We also made a diagram about how the cell surface CAR density affects the density of the phosphorylated receptors.
Steady state equation:
We assume that all phosphorylated receptors are in steady state during the immune response which changes ODEs into a homogeneous equation,making it easierl.Using Mathematica,we express A3 as a function of CAR receptor density T0 and its ligand density M0 and draw a three-dimensional graph.
Monte Carlo and diffusion
The diffusion of receptor between the kinase-rich domain and the phosphatase-rich environment is important.We use the Monte Carlo algorithm and the random walk model to simulate the diffusion of the CAR receptor on the cell surface and calculate the average retention time and equilibrium density ratio of those two regions.We add a diffusion-related term to the ODEs get a new Numerical Solution.
Pharmacokinetics
Since we used the Tet-on system,we model the pharmacokinetics of dox.We used a triexponential equation to describe the absorption,distribution,and degradation behavior of Dox in plasma and cells.
