Education & Engagement
During Bio-festival held by School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, we seized the        opportunity to popularize the concept of synthetic biology and immunotherapy and talk to public about our project. At the same time,        we issued questionnaires about CAR-T therapy (details in Human Practices-Survey of CAR-T Therapy page).
Bio-festival was an annual event in our school, which was aimed to popularize biological knowledge to public as well as students from        other majors. Together with SYSU-Software, we apply for booths of Bio-festival.
Our booth in Bio-festival
We made a synthetic biology version of the game "You draw I guess". We created detailed rules        for this game and created three levels.Whether the game participants know synthetic biology or not, they can participate in the game        and learn from the game.
Words for the easy level include transgene, cancer, laboratory animal, etc.
Words for the medium level include T cell, gene modification, immunity, etc.
Words for the hard level include CAR-T therapy, CRISPR Cas9, cytokine storm, etc.
We made explanation for every word and every level, participants could look up for it when they played the game. Participants who        puzzled out more than 3 words in one minute would receive prizes. The more questions they puzzled out, the more prizes they could        have.
In total, we gave away one bucket of chocolate (1/3 eaten by our team members), and more than 20 bonsais.
Some of the participants' works
The board game version of this game was shown to the public during Bio-festival and every participant received prizes. If there is a        chance, we will try to make an online version（maybe in next year）.
