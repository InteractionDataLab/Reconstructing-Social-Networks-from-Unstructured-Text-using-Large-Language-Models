      Chang Yanqi, team member of SYSU-CHINA, and Li Siqi, the former team member of SYSU-CHINA, were the mentors of team GDSYZX and GZHS-
      United in this year's competition. Tao Kehan, team member of SYSU-CHINA, also provided help to GDSYZX and GZHS-United on the 
      construction of biological bricks.
      Team GDSYZX is a high school teams of Guangdong Experimental High School, and team members of GZHS-United are from different high 
      schools in Guangzhou. Sun Yat-sen University and these high schools have had cooperation in students’ education for many years, some 
      of our team members even graduated from these high schools.
      Invited by their PI professor Jin Honglei, some of our team members became student assistants in the synthetic biology course of 
      Guangzhou Experimental High School, instructing high school students in literature reading and experimental design. Our team members 
      also assisted team GDSYZX and GZHS-United in synthetic biology experimental skills training on weekends.
      In addition, our team provided technical guidance and reagents for the construction of GZHS-United's biological brick BBa_K2840000 
      and GDSYZX's biological brick BBa_K2585000.

      Together with SYSU Software，we hold annual Biology Festival on our campus. 
      Our campus was opened to the public in Bio-festival, so it's a good chance for us to popularize synthetic biology knowledge. At the 
      same time, we handed out questionnaires concerning CAR-T therapy. More about the Annual Biology Festival activities can be found in 
      Public Engagement and Human Practice page.
      Special thanks to Student Union of school of life sciences for their help in the Bio-festival.

      During the summer vacation, our team members, Chang Yanqi and Tan Tianhao and Xu Jiaxian, went to ShanghaiTech University to 
      participate in 5th CCIC(Conference of China iGEMer Community).
      Xu Jiaxian, one of our team members, took the position as a ‘judge’ in CCIC. He gave comments and advices to other teams.
      We gave a presentation and showed our poster during CCIC, then we received a feed back saying that more focus should be paid on the 
      safety of U24 and our modeling is very well. Really thank you, Team ShanghaiTech!

      In May, our team members, Tang Yuluan and Ruan Shaolin and Xu Feihong, went to Shenzhen for the Southern China Regional Meeting.
      At that time, most of the teams haven’t made many progresses in experiment. Eight teams from southern China, not far from each 
      other, decided to have a meeting to exchange ideas, experience and funny things.
      Xu Feihong, one of our team members, lost her mobile phone on the taxi. Friends from Shenzhen University connected the taxi driver 
      and posted the mobile phone to Guangzhou. 
      Really thank you, Team SZU-China!
