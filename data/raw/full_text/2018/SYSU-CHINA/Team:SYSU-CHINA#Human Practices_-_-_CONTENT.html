      Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University.
      Dr. Xia Xiaojun, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China</SPAN></P><DIV class="mid-title">Q1: How is CAR-T therapy doing in clinical?</DIV><P><SPAN style="font-weight:bold">Dr. Cui Jun (referred as C hereafter): CAR-T is the future of Immunology and tumor treatment</SPAN>. 
      Accordingly, the Noble Prize in Physiology or Medicine of this year goes to CAR-T therapy, concerning the great developments made in 
      this field. It is strongly indicated that CAR-T and adoptive T-cell therapy are the hotspot of follo wing researches. These days, the 
      application of CD19 in clinical and FDA's approval of it both show that CAR-T is feasible in practical operation. <SPAN style="font-
      weight:bold">And there still remains a lot of improvements could be made in the future, like broader applications, slighter side-
      effects, and more effective function</SPAN>.<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">Dr. Xia Xiaojun (referred as X hereafter)</SPAN>：CAR-T has achieved good results in <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">hematological tumors</SPAN>, but almost no result has been achieved in <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">solid 
      tumors</SPAN>.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">Q2: How is CAR-T operated in clinical?</DIV><P>
      C: The patient needs a Lymphatic clearance before given CAR-T treatment. And his immune system will be rebuilt after. This whole 
      process has to be done in an gem-free room, considering the <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">patient's vulnerable condition</SPAN>. 
      Actually, you can call CAR-T a <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">personalized treatment</SPAN>, since different patients with different 
      conditions need to be given different treatments. So, more attempt and exploration are required.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">Q3: What is the potential side-effect of CAR-T therapy?</DIV><P>
      C: The modified immune system will kill tumor cells efficiently with substantial cytokines released, which leads to a <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">disastrous cytokine storm</SPAN>. Because CAR-T therapy targets on antigens, normal organs expressing the 
      same antigen as the tumor will be friendly-fired by CAR-T. So, CAR-T therapy will possibly cause 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">tissue-specific damage</SPAN>.
      X: The excessive immune response of CAR-T causes <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">cytokine storms</SPAN>, and excessive inflammatory 
      reactions can also put the patient's life at risk. In addition, <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">Off-target effect</SPAN> is dangerous. 
      For example, HER2 was used as a target. HER2 CAR-T cells not only kill tumor cells with high expression of HER2, but also damages 
      cardiomyocytes expressing HER2, resulting in patients' myocarditis. We try to achieve the goal that the target of CAR-T is not 
      expressed in cells other than tumor cells. Recently, <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">Nature Medicine</SPAN> reported the emergence of 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">CAR-cancer cells</SPAN>, which acquired the genes of CAR during CAR-T preparation, leading to 
      treatment failure.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">Q4: Which side-effect is the most terrible one in currently CAR-T therapy?</DIV><P>
      C: <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">Cytokine Storm</SPAN>, I shall say. Cytokine can activate immune responses on one hand, and its too 
      high or too long expression could also be harmful on the other hand. Terrible ones will lead to patients’ organ damage. In fact, 
      there exists a lot of negative regulation system in human body, however, cytokine storm caused by CAR-T therapy cannot simply be 
      regulated by that. So this is a tough problem facing CAR-T therapy and its patients.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">Q5: Is there ways to inhibit the side-effect of CAR-T therapy now？</DIV><P>
      C: At present, we try to fix cytokine storm <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">from its source</SPAN>, that is to stop the over-
      production of cytokines in T cells. However,when cytokine storm is already established, little can we do but to interfere it with 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">antibodies</SPAN>. And antibody interference is <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">expensive, cytokine-
      specific, and potentially poisonous itself</SPAN>. As for single cytokine with definite toxicity, antibody interference is very 
      effective. While in a cytokine storm, it's hard to find the notably toxic ones among a great amount of cytokines. So the inhibition 
      of cytokine storm by antibody interference cannot be achieved unless we could lock the most toxic one.
      X: It is not too difficult to solve if nothing but cytokine storm exists. Initially, some doctors use 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">glucocorticoids</SPAN> to completely suppress inflammation. But glucocorticoids will definitely affect 
      the therapeutic effect. Doctors just have to use this method and sacrifice efficacy.
      After we know the most important toxic cytokines, we will be able to use some <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">specific cytokine 
      blocking antibodies</SPAN>. Although it also inhibits part of the immune response and has a slower rate, it is superior to the 
      overall inhibition.
      In addition, some companies in the United States, such as <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">cellectis and bellicum</SPAN>, have similar 
      ideas to yours. They want to use a <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">switch</SPAN> to let CAR-T work as expected.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">Q6: Will the high cost of treatment hinder the popularizing of CAR-T?</DIV><P>
      C: As for me, the high cost will not be a problem in the future. With the development of bio-technology, the price of CAR-T treatment 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">will be definitely decreasing</SPAN>. Inevitably, as a research hotspot, CAR-T can attract more and 
      more researchers to find new ways to lower its cost. For now, as a kind of cancer treatment, the price of CAR-T is 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">acceptable</SPAN> relatively.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">Q7: A viral protein (has been checked in) is involved in our project. In your opinion, what kind of safety problems will it bring?</DIV><P>
      C: There's no doubt that virus proteins are kind of <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">risky, potentially or visibly</SPAN>. Actually, it 
      is quite a common experiment to transfect with viral vectors in our lab. I think, when we have to use virus, safety modifying of 
      viral vectors is prerequisite. And we also need to pay attention to its <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">potential danger</SPAN> in the 
      human body.
      X: U24 is a protein derived from herpes virus. It is <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">necessary to verify</SPAN> whether the foreign 
      protein itself has side effects or neurotoxicity. We need to verify that U24 is expressed only in the target cells and will not 
      secreted extracellularly. In addition, the tet-on system is used to control the expression of U24, and attention should also be paid 
      to the <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">leakage of the tet-on system</SPAN>.There is also some basal level of expression in tet-on 
      without DOX induction. Whether <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">low levels of U24</SPAN> will affect the efficiency of CAR, whether it 
      will be cytotoxic, is also problems that need to be verified.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">Q8: If we can obtain the desirable result, what role will it play in the optimization of CAR-T treatment?</DIV><P>
      C: From my perspective, the innovation of your project is to regulate the activity and function of CAR-T cells 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">without killing them</SPAN>.In practice, there needs to be appropriate amount of CAR-T cells in 
      patient's body. Too few or too many CAR-T cells will both cause serious problems. But if there exists a switch to 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">regulate the activity of CAR-T cells</SPAN>, then we no longer need to consider the number 
      of CAR-T cells injected into the patient's body. Thus, it may help a lot in the <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">suppression of 
      cytokine storm</SPAN>. 
      X: Control of CAR-T is a problem that almost every practitioner will pay attention to. Your project is also an attempt. Based on 
      clinical experience and reports and results statistics, coupled with close monitoring during treatment, 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">pre-administration of cytokine storms</SPAN> can be achieved <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">in advance 
      to prevent cytokine storms</SPAN>.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">Q9: Any comments on our project?</DIV><P>
      X: Many companies are studying the control of CAR-T therapy. Some of their highlights are ‘fast’, so the 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">timeliness</SPAN> of this system is more important. What are the pros and cons of 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">toxicity and production costs</SPAN> between the small molecules used by other companies 
      and the DOX you use should be noticed.
      In addition, the premise of this project is that the CAR-T reaction is <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">too strong</SPAN>. However, 
      only the CD19 CAR-T has strong effects, 
      but there are still many types of CAR-T that do not have sufficient reaction intensity.
      Moreover, in the current CAR-T treatment, the patient's recurrence rate during the subsequent time is still relatively high, which 
      may be because the CAR-T cells are not <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">maintained in the body for a sufficient period of time</SPAN>. 
      Therefore, your system cannot prevent the maintenance of CAR-T cells in the body.
      If clinical application is desired, the system needs to be validated in normal human peripheral blood, 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">primary T cells.
   </SPAN></P><DIV class="mid-title">Q10: How fast should our system's response be to become clinically meaningful?</DIV><P>
      C: Of course <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">as fast as possible</SPAN>. But the delay definitely exists, youdd better control it 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">within hours</SPAN>. That is to say, sensitive molecular switches should be preferred. I think that 
      you can make <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">more combinations of different molecular switches</SPAN> and adjust them according to 
      various situations. For example, CAR-T can cause tissue-specific damage due to the same antigen expression of tumor cells and normal 
      cells. If you can design a <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">molecular switch based on a gene specifically expressed in that certain 
      tissue</SPAN>, then the tissue damage may be avoided, which also broadens the choice of antigens involved in the CAR-T therapy.

   Figure 1. Pie Chart of Education Background Information
   Figure 2. Pie Chart of Information about Majors among informants.</CENTER><P>
      These two pie charts above show that our informants are mostly well-educated, with 89% of them being undergraduate. And we got a 
      sample mostly majored in Sciences (74%), especially Biology, Physiology and Medicine (45%). It's a good news to know that our sample 
      also includes people engaged in different majors other than the related ones. And our informants cover all ages, while people aged 
      20-30 account for the majority.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">Part 2 How well do our informants know about cancer and CAR-T therapy?</DIV><DIV class="small-title">Q1: Are you familiar with cancer and its treatment?</DIV><CENTER>
   Figure 3. Pie Chart of Familiarity of cancer among Informants.<DIV class="small-title">Q2: Are you familiar with CAR-T therapy?</DIV>
   Figure 4. Pie Chart of Familiarity of CAR-T therapy among Informants.</CENTER><P>
      Roughly half of the participants were familiar with cancer (52%). However, only one-third of them are familiar with CAR-T therapy 
      (35%). What's more, 43% of the informants have never heard about CAR-T. Due to this great contrast and the role CAR-T plays in 
      current cancer treatment, we considered it high time to introduce more about CAR-T Therapy to the public.
   </P><DIV class="small-title">Q3: What is the range of cancer treatment price that you can undertake?</DIV><CENTER>
   Figure 5. Pie Chart of price range that Informants can undertake.</CENTER><P>
      Most informants (54%) stated that they could only undertake cancer therapy less than 200,000 RMB (nearly $30,000), and another 26% of 
      them stated that less than 500,000RMB (nearly$72,000) would be affordable. However, the average cost of cancer treatment is around 
      500,000RMB. That is to say, only 20% of our informants are willing to pay the price. So, this leave a space for CAR-T, as a 
      prospering therapy, to knock a better market which targets on lower-budget patients.
   </P><DIV class="small-title">Q4: Where do you think that we should make a breakthrough in cancer treatment at present? (Multiple Selection)</DIV><CENTER>
   Figure 6. Histogram of expected breakthrough to be made in cancer therapy.</CENTER><P>
      It's quite surprising to find that only half of our sample (93 out of 201) think that reducing risks is a breakthrough point in 
      cancer therapy. Cancer therapies have long been at high risks because people don't necessarily know how a therapy could be more 
      effective, so there exists a lot of experimental treatments. Perhaps for this reason, a large number of people think that the risk of 
      treatment is not worth mentioning when fronting costs and curative effect.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">Part 3 CAR-T therapy's potential in cancer treatment.</DIV><DIV class="small-title">Q5: Do you agree that CAR-T is a therapy with more advantages over traditional ones?</DIV><CENTER>
   Figure 7. Pie chart of informants' recognition of CAR-T's advantage over traditional therapies</CENTER><P>
      Clearly, most informants (52%) haven't got enough understanding of CAR-T therapy to decide whether it is better than traditional ones 
      or not. Only 8% informants have clear-cut stands. And the left 40% take a midst stand to wait and see. Therefore, the popularity of 
      CAR-T therapy is not high in the public's opinion. CAR-T needs a little bit of promotion.
   </P><DIV class="small-title">Q6: What's your major concern about CAR-T therapy?</DIV><CENTER>
   Figure 8. Pie chart of informants' concern of CAR-T therapy.</CENTER><DIV class="small-title">Q7: What kind of shortages do you think that CAR-T therapy has at present? (Multiple Selection)</DIV><CENTER>
   Figure 9. Histogram of 4 shortages that informants think CAR-T therapy has at present</CENTER><DIV class="small-title">Q8: As a new treatment, there is certain risks in CAR-T therapy. So, under what circumstances will you choose CAR-T therapy? (Multiple Selection)</DIV><CENTER>
   Figure 10. Histogram of circumstances that informants will choose CAR-T since it is a risking treatment</CENTER><P>
      In Figure 10. we can see that only few people define CAR-T as definitely their top choice (16 out of 201) or definitely never their 
      choice (9 out of 201). Most people still consider curative effect as the most important factor, followed by concerns of price and 
      risks. And this coincides with Figure 8. and Figure 9. 
      CAR-T as a new cancer treatment has shown some side-effects, while our work is precisely aimed at reduce that risks. So, the 
      importance of our work is once again confirmed indirectly.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">Part 4 Recognition of our work.</DIV><DIV class="small-title">Q9: Do you consider our work meaningful? (We try to reversibly control CAR-T cell activities by regulating the CAR receptor on the cell surface, so that the side effect of CAR-T therapy could be reduced or even eliminated.)</DIV><CENTER>
   Figure 11. Pie chart of informants' recognition of our work.</CENTER><P>
      To our delight, most people consider our work to be meaningful. After these questions above, our informants had a better 
      understanding of the CAR-T as a whole. Therefore, we deserve a great recognition of work as shown in Figure 11. This also proves that 
      the choice of our subjects has indeed captured the urge need of the public about CAR-T therapy and even cancer treatment.
   </P><DIV class="small-title">Q10: A virus-derived protein will be used in our work to improve the therapy. Do you agree that virus-derived protein is suitable for treatment-use?</DIV><CENTER>
   Figure 12. Pie chart of informants' recognition of the use of a virus-derived protein.</CENTER><P>
      This question is made for informants majored in Biology, Physiology and Medicine, since others may not possess a thorough 
      understanding of virus and its protein. And we found that our peers have a rather high acceptance (74%) in our choice of the viral 
      protein.
   </P><DIV class="small-title">Q11: To what degree should the viral protein be controlled, in order to make people feel enough safety?</DIV><CENTER>
   Figure 13. Histogram of viral protein controlled</CENTER></DIV><DIV id="3" class="page-content"><DIV class="big-title"><SPAN style="border-bottom: 4px solid rgb(255,196,72);">Integrated Human Practices</SPAN></DIV><P>
      Most of the integrated human practices have been shown above, and here is a conclusion.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">1. What attitude do public have towards CAR-T therapy?</DIV><P>
      We tried and finally found out the fact that it's really difficult to popularize CAR-T therapy to people who only have common sense. 
      So, it can be found that most of the people who completed our questionnaire are undergraduates (our schoolmates). We didn’t have 
      interviews with patients, which seems to be what should be done, because we don’t think it's a good thing to give patients 
      unrealistic hope, and our project is just an idea now.
      A college student, Wei Zexi, was dead in 2016. He searched the Internet for cancer treatment to cure himself, and he chose a hospital 
      for immunotherapy, which was a swindle. Immunotherapy can be easily suggestive of swindle in China for a long time, and even the 
      Nobel Prize couldn't completely eliminate this shadow. This makes our popularizing more difficult.
      So, we chose another direction. We asked people <SPAN style="font-weight:bold"> what do they thought that we should make a breakthrough in cancer treatment at 
      present</SPAN> and <SPAN style="font-weight:bold"> what’s their major concern about CAR-T therapy</SPAN>, etc. 
      From figure 7-9 of <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:SYSU-CHINA/Human_Practices#2">Survey of CAR-T Therapy</A>, we can easily find that most people are not optimistic about CAR-T therapy now, and 
      expect its future development. What is concerned about now is the recovery rate, risk and side-effect, and the price is still 
      exceeding expectations. Our project is aimed to help to solve problems including side-effect and high prices, which are also 
      mentioned by experts we interviewed.</P><DIV class="mid-title">2. How and why we chose this idea?</DIV><P>
      After 3 brainstorms with our teammates, we had more than 10 ideas. Professor Huang Junjiu and Professor Liu Feng helped us to pick 
      out the final idea. Vice Dean of School of Life Sciences, Professor Xiang Hui, thought that we should prove the significance of our 
      project, so we visited many professors to evaluate it. The professors we visited include: Laurent Coscoy, professor from Berkeley, 
      did lots of works in the research of U24 protein; Huang Shengfeng, professor from our school, taught us immunology course and have 
      interests in CAR-T therapy; Cui Jun, professor from our school, taught us introduction to immunology course.
      It is a pity that we didn’t record full of our conversations with professors because of some reasons, and we were not completely 
      sure about the choice of this project at that time. Part of the conversations were recorded in the  <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:SYSU-CHINA/Human_Practices#1">Interview with experts</A>  page.
      Professor Huang Shengfeng told us about the <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">clinical treatment methods, risks and side effects of CAR-T</SPAN>. Professor Cui Jun pointed 
      out that cytokine storm might be the most important side effect. Professor Laurent Coscoy introduced the key protein, <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">U24</SPAN>, to us.
      These professors brought us deeper review of CAR-T therapies and helped us a lot in the project approval process.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">3. Is it safe enough to use U24?</DIV><P>
      In  <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:SYSU-CHINA/Human_Practices#1">Interview with experts</A> page, Q7 and Q9 are focusing on the safety of U24.
      Q7: A viral protein (has been checked in) is involved in our project. In your opinion, what kind of safety problems will it bring?
      
      Q9: Any comments on our project?
      Dr. Cui Jun thinks that U24 is allowed to be used, but attention should be paid to test its <SPAN style="font-weight:bold"> potential danger</SPAN> in human body.
      Dr. Xiao Xiaojun thinks that we need to test <SPAN style="font-weight:bold"> the leakage of Tet-On system</SPAN> and the <SPAN style="font-weight:bold"> side effect of U24</SPAN>( even with a low level 
      expression)
      In <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:SYSU-CHINA/Human_Practices#2">Survey of CAR-T Therapy</A> page, Q10 and Q11 are focusing on the safety of U24
      Q10: A virus-derived protein will be used in our work to improve the therapy. Do you agree that virus-derived protein is suitable for 
      treatment-use?
      Q11: To what degree should the viral protein be controlled, in order to make people feel enough safety?
      It's beyond our expectations that there is a<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">   rather high acceptance (74%) in our choice of the viral protein</SPAN>. At the same time, most 
      of the people thinks that U24 shouldn't do harm to human body. More than quarter of people thinks that the expression of U24 should 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">be regulated by foreign medicine</SPAN>, U24's <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">expression pathway</SPAN> should be able to be blocked, and U24 should <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">be degraded very fast</SPAN> in 
      vivo.
      We design experiments to test <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">  Protein Half-Life of U24 </SPAN>, leakage of Tet-On system(can be seen in <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">  Determination of Optimal Concentration of Dox </SPAN>), and <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">  The potential toxicity of U24 </SPAN>.

      Q8: If we can obtain the desirable result, what role will it play in the optimization of CAR-T treatment?
      Q9: Any comments on our project?
      Q10: How fast should our system’s response be to become clinically meaningful?
      Dr. Xiao Xiaojun thinks that the <SPAN style="font-weight:bold"> timeliness</SPAN> of this system is very important, and Dr. Cui Jun thinks that the system's response time 
      should be as fast as possible, and would be better to be<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">   within hours</SPAN>.
      Based on experimental data, our model is for prediction of the response of Tet-On system.
      Experimental data is shown in the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:SYSU-CHINA/Demonstrate">Demonstrate page</A>, and the prediction is shown in the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:SYSU-CHINA/Model">Modeling Page</A>.

      The interviews with experts also provided inspiration for our product design and future works.
      &quot;The innovation of your project is to regulate the activity and function of CAR-T cells without killing them. It may help a lot in 
      the suppression of cytokine storm.&quot; Said Dr. Cui.
      Dr. Xia provide us a more specific method to control cytokine storm with our system. He said:&quot;Based on clinical experience and 
      reports and results statistics, coupled with close monitoring during treatment, <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">  pre-administration of cytokine storms  </SPAN>
 can be achieved 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">  in advance to prevent cytokine storms </SPAN>.&quot;
      He also pointed out that if clinical application is desired, the system needs to be validated in normal human peripheral blood, 
      primary T cells.
      Dr. Cui also gave us inspiration of the future works.&quot;you can make <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">  more combinations of different molecular switches  </SPAN>
 and adjust 
      them according to various situations&quot; It is a very &quot;Synthetic&quot; and &quot;iGEM&quot; idea , and we hope to do some work on it (see more in <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:SYSU-CHINA/Applied_Design">Applied Design Page</A>).
