How cells response?And other questions</SPAN></DIV><P>
      Our project aims to regulate the activity of CAR-T cells in order to reduce the risk of inflammatory factor storm which do damage to 
      patients. In order to further reveal how many drugs and how often we should give patients, we have modeled to solve these problems. 
      In order to guide the amount of administration, we expect to be able to know how the amount of administration or the time after 
      administration affect the effect of drug, in order to avoid the calculation trouble caused by the excessive definition of the 
      variable, we divided the whole process into ①dox pharmacokinetics of Dox②Tet-On system's response and U24 protein expression and ③the impact of cell surface concentration of CAR and ligand on the immune intensity.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">1、Why we use dox</DIV><P>
      Dox is a tetracycline analogue that induces Tet-On system activation. Compared with tetracycline, it has better stability and lower 
      toxicity. Therefore, we choose Dox as our inducer.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">2、Why we choose CAR as the points of regulation? </DIV><P>
      Observing the structure of the entire T cell activation signaling pathway and selecting the DNA-RNAP complex for sensitivity 
      analysis, it can be easily seen that CAR is a key node and have biggest coefficient (assume kinetic order always close to 1), so 
      regulate the amount of CAR is reasonable.
   </P><CENTER>

   </CENTER><DIV class="mid-title">3、 Concentration in cells</DIV><P>
      As we all known，drugs are not all distributed in cells but are distributed between plasma and cells in human's body. We consulted 
      the literature and obtained the transfer rate constant of drugs form the digestive system to plasma or form cytosol to the plasma as 
      well as redistribution rate constant form cytosol to the plasma [2]，[3]. After consider the drug's decomposition rate is consistent 
      in the plasma and cell, we list reaction equation as follows
   </P><P>
      By solving the homogeneous ODEs（ordinary differential equations ）obtained by the law of mass action, we finally get the function of 
      the concentration of the drug in the cytosol about time and plot it as follows(assume dosage is 
      2mmol/kg). As can be seen from the analysis of the Dox -time relationship, Dox concentration-Time relationship follows a similar 
      manner to a three-exponential function will reach a peak after about 8 hours, and then decrease quickly, the concentration of dox has 
      dropped very low at about 4000 minutes. We also plot the situation of successive administration and find the drug concentration in 
      the cytosol will stabilize when administered 2mmol per kg per 1000 minutes with certain parameters we use.

   </CENTER><DIV class="mid-title">4、Response of Tet on system</DIV><P>
     The change of dox over time is obtained. Next step is to consider the Response of the Tet-on system. Due to the complexity of the 
     above functions, we can not find the analytical solution so we assume that under normal conditions, the content of rtTA in the cells 
     is in steady state and the transcription rate is determined by the following formula:.</P><CENTER><SPAN style="font-style:italic;font-size:18px"> 
        v[t]=B/((1+dox[t]/kd))+A (((dox[t])/kd))/((1+dox[t]/kd))</SPAN></CENTER><P>
     Among them, (1+dox[t]/kd) and (((dox[t])/kd))/((1+dox[t]/kd)) represent the ratio of time-dependent Dox-unbound /binding DNA, B and A 
     are the rate of leaked transcription and the rate of induced transcription, respectively, and kd is the apparent dissociation 
     constant. We implicitly include rtTA and some other constant in kinetic constants above according to literature and experiments. 
     Having obtained certain data [4]、[5]、[6]、[7]., we can get certain transcription rate and solve the differential equation with 
     considering the degradation of RNA which is listed below to obtain the relationship between RNA concentration and time .</P><CENTER><SPAN style="font-style:italic;font-size:18px">

   </CENTER><P>
      After considering the translation rate constant by estimated from the kinetic constant and the ribosome concentration[7],[8],[9], we 
      try to solve the ODE about translation. However, due to the use of interpolation function, we can't solve the equation. At first, we 
      want to solve it by the perturbation method which mean determine the protein yield without degradation firstly and use the result to 
      estimate the degradation rate at each moment, but we found that it is difficult to construct a suitable perturbation function over a 
      long period of time because the value of the perturbation always become too colossal, thereby we having to give up this method.
      Next, we remember that we can use the exponential decay law to estimate this result, so we estimate the yield-time relationship 
      according to the expression and plot it.</P><CENTER><SPAN style="font-style:italic;font-size:18px"> 
         u24[t]=E^(-kdeu24 t )Integrate[ktrans* rna[t],t]</SPAN></CENTER><P>
      Qualitatively, the model is correct, but the drawing of the rate of production shows that such treatment overestimates the 
      degradation. We use the average time, which is obtained by integrate the amount of protein without considering degradation with time 
      and divide the result by the amount of protein, instead of the time to improve calculation result but it has not improved much. We 
      give the relationship between degradation rate constant and u24 concentration-Time relationship, too. We find that the degradation 
      rate constant affect maximum U24 concentration and retention time in great extent. It may possible to use variant degradation tag to 
      control concentration of U24 and density of CAR in wide range.

      After surveying the equation and using the new micro-element ktrans rna[t]  E^(-kdeu24(t0-t)dt instead of dy and integrate, we get an 
      integral upper bound function. After finding the numerical solution of it and plot it as follows, we find those attenuation result is 
      quite accuracy, RNA degrade slowly and lasts longer. Further calculation will be obtained after we get higher computing power.
      In general, the subsequent refinement changes quantitatively, but has little effect on the peak shape, and is in good agreement with 
      the tendency of amount of dox.

      Because we have some doubts about the accuracy of some constants use above, we hope to use Hill equation to get another new model. 
      After obtain the protein yield-time relationship by experiment, we find that it roughly matches the Hill equation. In the form, we 
      use the Hill equation to fit it which is often used. Since cytoplasm Dox concentration can be regarded as a constant during cell 
      culture, according to the experimental data, expression

      expression, A0 and A1 stand for the production rate of leak express or of induced express, ki stand for affinity constant between dox 
      and DNA, h is Hill constant and B stand for the Cytotoxic of Dox. Data is obtained by our experiment about cell-culture with

   </P><DIV class="mid-title">6、the relationship between car and immune signal intensity</DIV><DIV class="small-title">Why choose A3 as an indicator?</DIV><P>
      We know that in immunology, surface receptors are generally transmit information to the downstream pathway through phosphorylation. 
      Due to the phosphorylated region on the TCR is mainly the ITAM domain and there are three ITAM domains on the CAR, it is reasonable 
      to use the concentration of CAR which three ITAMs are phosphorylated as the indicator of immune signal intensity.
   </P><DIV class="small-title">Dynamic mode diagram</DIV><P>
      We chose a model called &quot;separation model&quot; to describe the behavior of CAR during the immunization process. The main content of 
      this model is that large phosphatases will be &quot;squeezed&quot; out of the immune synapse to form a kinase-rich domain(KRD) during the 
      process of immunization process, T cell receptors that bind to pMHCs will undergo a series of phosphorylation and initiate downstream 
      pathways by recruiting molecules such as ZAP70. After reference to the dynamic proofreading model, we made a dynamic mode diagram of 
      CAR phosphorylation.[10],[11],[12],[13],[14]</P><CENTER>
   Figure 10：Schematic of the model 
   </CENTER><P>
      According to the law of mass action, we list a series of ordinary differential equations(ODE) as follows to describe phosphorylation 
      and use the density of the three-phosphorylated receptor(A3) as an indicator of immune intensity. Since the ordinary differential 
      equations have no analytical solution, we adopt two approaches to solve this problem.

      Using matlab®, we get the numerical solution of the system of ODEs. It can be seen that the tertiary phosphorylated receptors 
      gradually increased and eventually almost all of the receptors were phosphorylated. We also made a diagram about how the cell surface 
      CAR density affects the density of the phosphorylated receptors.

      We assume that all phosphorylated receptors are in steady state during the immune response which changes ODEs into a homogeneous 
      equation, making it easier to solve. Using Mathematica®, we express A3 as a function of CAR receptor density T0 and its ligand density 
      M0 and draw a three-dimensional graph of it. It can be seen that A3 is almost linearly positively 
      correlated for T0 and M0, respectively. Taking the ratio of the density of A3 produced as a specificity index, we plot how T0 density 
      affects CAR-T's specificity of cells have different ligand numbers and see when ratio of density of ligands between two cells is 
      low, specificity depends on density of T0 linearly unless T0 lower than a certain number, which will make specificity vanish. When 
      the ratio approach or exceed 0.3, specificity vanish totally. Using mathmatica®, we also plot how kinetic parameter affect our result.

      The diffusion of receptor between the kinase-rich domain and the phosphatase-rich 
      environment is important. We use the Monte Carlo algorithm and the random walking model to simulate the diffusion of the CAR receptor 
      on the cell surface and calculate the average retention time and equilibrium density ratio of those two regions. After add a 
      diffusion-related term to the ODEs and chemical equation, we get a new Numerical Solution and find an interesting result——there is 
      no steady state in this model, instead, production of A3m show a peak shape after the formation of immune synapses, and then returns 
      to 0. We also used this model to do some simulations of KRD formation. New chemical equations we use are show below.

      According to the literature, phosphorylated CAR will form cluster on the cell surface, and then zap70 will be recruited to initiate 
      the downstream reaction. Here, we use ZAP70 concentration to more accurately reflect the immune intensity. To make calculate easier, 
      we define the biggest cluster as a tetramer and assuming that each CAR recruits only one ZAP70, according to the aggregation-
      recruitment pattern and the low of mass action, and using the steady-state approximation, we solve the expressions of the different 
      state complexes and determine the relationship of the amount of activated ZAP70. T0, M0 with certain various kinetic constants, the 
      final result is too complicated to listed here[10]

   </CENTER><DIV class="mid-title">7、Conclusion</DIV><P>
      Based on the relationship between dox and A3, we can get a new function for the dose and actual effect and understand the 
      relationship between dose, administration time and immune intensity better. Combined with more clinical trials, this new function 
      will be more instructive. In combination with relationship between Dox and immune intensity, we can get guidance on the dose of dox 
      to the patient, too.
      Using the modeling we modeled, we can learn that Dox should be 8 hours administered before the symptoms worsen. If long-acting 
      inhibition is required, it should be administered at a frequency of about 1 time/day (based on the dose of 5 mmol/kg). The 
      combination of models and more experimental studies in the clinic, we can better guide the application.
