In order to test the ability of U24 and our device to downregulate CAR receptors,we first need to construct cell line that express CAR.We have constructed vector that express anti-CD19 CAR under the control of EF-1α promoter.
To verify U24's ability to downregulate CARs,we have constructed vector that express anti-CD19 CAR under the control of EF-1α promoter.As a control,we constructed a defective mutant of U24.
For our final device,we constructed vector that both expresses doxycycline responsive transcriptional factor rtTA consititutively under the promoter UbC,and expresses GFP-T2A-U24 in response to doxycycline under the control of tetON promoter.
