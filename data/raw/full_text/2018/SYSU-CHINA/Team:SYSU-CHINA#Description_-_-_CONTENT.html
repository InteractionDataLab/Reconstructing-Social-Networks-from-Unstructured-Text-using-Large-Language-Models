      CAR-T therapy is one of the most promising treatment for cancer, with multiple ongoing clinical trials worldwide and 2 therapies 
      approved by the FDA. However, without proper control after administration of CAR-T cells, severe adverse effects may bring fatal 
      risks to the patients, especially during the clinical trial stages. While suicide switches serve as common methods for controlling 
      adverse effects, they completely halt the expensive treatment, and repeating the treatment process could be a burden for the 
      patients, both physically and financially. To provide a safer yet affordable CAR-T therapy, we developed a reversible safe switch 
      controlled by small molecules called CAR BRAKE. By expressing U24 protein of the human herpesvirus 6A under the control of tet-ON 
      promoter, we can downregulate CAR molecules on the cell surface through endosomal recycling inhibition. We demonstrated in Jurkat 
      cells that U24 can downregulate surface T cell receptors, which can be subsequently restored by removal of doxycycline. Modest effect 
      of U24 on surface level of CARs was seen in Jurkat cells. In addition, we determined the optimal concentration for induction, 
      expression time course and degradation half-life of U24 in HEK293T cells. No cytotoxicity was observed in cells transfected with U24. 
      Collectively, our results indicates our design could potentially be used as a universal add-on for all CAR-Ts and TCR-Ts to ensure 
      safety.

      CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T cell) therapy is one of the most promising treatment for cancer, with multiple ongoing clinical 
      trials worldwide and 2 therapies already approved by the FDA<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(June et al., 2018) </SPAN>.       
      The therapy engineers endogenous T cells from the patients with synthetic receptors for tumor antigens, enabling them to target tumor 
      cells. The synthetic receptor, or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), consists of an extracellular antibody-derived single chain 
      variable fragment (scFv) domain that can bind specific antigen with high affinity, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular 
      signaling domain. The 1st generation CAR molecules only include a CD3zeta signaling domain, the minimal domain for T cell activation, 
      while 2nd and 3rd generation CARs also include one or more co-stimulating domains from CD28, CD137, 4-1BB, or others. The addition 
      signals enhance cytokines production and facilitate expansion of CAR T cells population upon repeated exposure to target       
      antigens<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(June et al., 2018) </SPAN>.
   </P><P>
      Similar to other types of adoptive cell transfer (ACT) therapy, CAR T therapy requires drawing peripheral blood from the patients, 
      Sorting out T cells, introducing new receptors by transducing T cells with lentiviral vectors, and expanding the population in vitro 
      before re-infusion into patients. 
   </P><P>
      CAR T therapy has achieved unprecedented success in hematological cancer. In several clinical trials using CAR T to treat leukemia 
      and lymphoma, high percentage of patients experienced partial or complete response<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(June and Sadelain, 
      2018) </SPAN>. 
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">The Adverse Effects</DIV><P>
      However, without proper control after administration of CAR-T cells, severe adverse effects associated with CAR-T therapy may bring 
      fatal risks to the patients, especially during the clinical trial stages. The most common side effects include cytokine release 
      syndrome, on-target off-tumor toxicity and off-target toxicity.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">cytokine release syndrome (CRS) </DIV><P>
      CRS is considered the most common acute toxicity in the CAR T therapy, with patients experiencing fever, tachycardia, hypotension, 
      and other symptoms after infusion of CAR T cells. The cytokines can be produced by CAR T cells themselves or by other immune cells 
      like macrophages. Likewise, a wide range of cytokines participate in these pathological conditions, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), 
      IL-2 and interferon-Î³<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Maude et al., 2014) </SPAN>. The CRS development correlates with high level of 
      CAR T cells number and peak level of several cytokines and is also related to tumor burden<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Brentjens 
      et al., 2013) </SPAN>. 
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">Neurotoxicity</DIV><P>
      Neurotoxicity of CAR T therapy has been reported by several research groups. The symptoms include confusion, delirium, expressive 
      aphasia, obtundation, myoclonus, and seizure. Similar neurological toxicity has been reported with blinatumomab, a bispecific anti-
      CD19 anti-CD3 antibody<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Brudno and Kochenderfer, 2016) </SPAN>. However, the underlying mechanism 
      remains unknown<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(June et al., 2018) </SPAN>. 
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">On-target off-tumor toxicity </DIV><P>
      On-target off-tumor toxicity is induced when the target antigen is also expressed on non-tumor tissues, despite its lower expression 
      level, and CAR T cells can inflict normal tissue damage by target antigen recognition. Such toxicity has been documented in the 
      literature and has even lead to fatality. In one study 3 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma receiving CAR T cells 
      targeting carboxyanhydrase-IX (CAIX) developed liver damage, due to unexpected expression of CAIX on the bile ducts
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Lamers et al., 2013) </SPAN>. The risk is further exemplified by another study in which a patient 
      with metastatic colorectal cancer experienced acute respiratory distress and pulmonary edema and subsequently died after infusion of 
      CAR Ts targeting ERBB2 (Her-2/neu), possibly due to expression of ERBB2 on lung tissue<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Morgan et al., 
      2010) </SPAN>.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">Cross-reactivity </DIV><P>
      Cross-reactivity occurs when CAR T cells recognize antigens on normal tissues similar to target antigen, possibly leading to organ 
      damage. By far no cross reactivity of CAR T cells has been reported, instead such toxicity has been observed in clinical trials using 
      modified TCR T cells<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Cameron et al., 2013) </SPAN>.
   </P></DIV><DIV id="2" class="page-content"><DIV class="big-title"><SPAN style="border-bottom: 4px solid rgb(179,113,162);">Current Methods</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="mid-title">Immunosuppressive drugs</DIV><P>
      To date the most common method for CRS management is giving immunosuppressive drugs. Tocilizumab (Actemra), an anti-interleukin-6-
      receptor antagonist originally developed for rheumatoid arthritis, is often effective in the management of CAR T cells related 
      cytokine release syndrome and has been approved by the FDA for such treatments<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Brudno and 
      Kochenderfer, 2016) </SPAN>.       
      Corticosteroids are given when patients are not responsive to Tocilizumab, but they are not considered as the first option since they 
      can interfere with T cell functions and induce T cell apoptosis<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Brudno and Kochenderfer, 2016) 
      </SPAN>, with some research demonstrating that prolonged administration of corticosteroids can impair CAR T therapy efficacy
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Davila et al., 2014) </SPAN>.       
      A potential risk for immunosuppressive treatment is its global effect on the immune system, rendering the patients more vulnerable to 
      opportunistic infections by bacteria, fungi and viruses. It has been demonstrated that rheumatoid arthritis patients have higher rate 
      of respiratory infections<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Hoshi et al., 2012) </SPAN>. In addition, a recent study suggested a 
      correlation between CRS and rate of infection<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Hill et al., 2018) </SPAN>. Although no causative 
      conclusion can be drawn that the immunosuppressive treatment for CRS leads to those infection, the risk of immunosuppression-
      associated infections should not be overlooked, and it is desirable to mitigate adverse effects in CAR T therapies without global 
      inhibition on the immune system.
   </P><DIV class="mid-title">Suicide Genes</DIV><P>
      Compared to the systemic effect of immunosuppressive drugs, genetic modification of the infused CAR T cells is able to provide a more 
      precise control on the infused cell population alone. A straightforward method is to engineer suicide genes in CAR T cells and remove 
      transferred cell population when giving drugs<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Marin et al., 2012) </SPAN>. The first suicide gene 
      evaluated in the clinical trials is thymidine kinase from herpes simplex virus, which can induce cell death by DNA synthesis 
      inhibition upon treatment with ganciclovir. Inducible dimerization of Fas or caspase 9 serves as a second strategy for selective 
      depletion of modified cells. The inducible caspase 9 (ICas9) molecule contains an FK506 binding domain and is able to mediate 
      dimerization of caspase 9 domain when adding AP1903, and ultimately induce cell apoptosis<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Budde et 
      al., 2013) </SPAN>. A third method is achieved by programming the cells to express truncated epidermal growth factor receptors on the 
      cell surface, which can be targeted by antibody and induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Wang et al., 2011) </SPAN></SPAN>.      
      However, these methods could deplete CAR-T cells and halt the expensive treatment. Repeat the treatment may be a burden on the 
      patients, both physically and financially.       </P><DIV class="mid-title">Controllable Receptors</DIV><P>
      Another strategy is to engineer the CAR receptors, rendering them requiring additional signals, typically a small molecule drug, to 
      fully activate. Wu et al. <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Wu et al., 2015) </SPAN> first demonstrated the such strategy by 
      constructing a split synthetic receptor, with one chain containing the extracellular scFv, hinge and costimulatory domain and the 
      other containing the activation domain of CD3zeta. When adding small molecule Rapalog, the heterodimerization of 2 chains 
      reconstitutes a full CAR receptor and therefore can generate full activation signals. Similarly, Juillerat et al. 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Juillerat et al., 2016) </SPAN> modified the hinge domain to include a FKBP/FRB dimerization pair, 
      which separate the scFv from the cell membrane. When AP21967 (a rapamycin analog) is added, the interaction of FKBP and FRB fold the 
      extracellular domain into an optimal conformation for activation. 
   </P><P>
      However, modification of receptors may be troublesome that it may alter the structure and conformation of the receptors, which in 
      turns may interfere with CARs' function. Such notion is exemplified in the research of Wu et al., that different split methods 
      resulted in different signaling outcomes, with most of the receptor pairs failing to fully activate in the presence of drugs
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Wu et al., 2015) </SPAN>. Considering a lack of conclusive information on mechanisms of CAR T cell 
      activation<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Harris and Kranz, 2016) </SPAN> and the diversity of existing CARs in clinical 
      research<SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(June et al., 2018) </SPAN>, a method must be developed for each type of CAR to ensure it 
      works as expected, which can be labor-intensive.       
      Furthermore, such methods are limited to CAR Ts alone, which have synthetic receptors. In contrast, TCR Ts rely on the endogenous T 
      cell receptor complex to function properly, and TCRs, as part of the complex, requires native conformation to function, leaving 
      little, if any, space for modification.      </P></DIV><DIV id="3" class="page-content"><DIV class="big-title"><SPAN style="border-bottom: 4px solid rgb(179,113,162);">Reference</SPAN></DIV><P class="reference">
