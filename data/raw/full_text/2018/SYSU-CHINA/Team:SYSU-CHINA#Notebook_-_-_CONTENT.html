      For SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, 20μl of each sample was loaded and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Protein in the gel was transferred to PVDF membrane (0.2μm, Millipore). After blocking with 5X skimmed milk (in TBST), the PVDF membrane was cut according to the marker size. The upper part was probed with anti-beta-actin monoclonal antibody (Abmart) diluted 1X skimmed milk (in TBST) at a ratio of 1:2000. The lower half was probed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (BioLegend) diluted in 1X skimmed milk (in TBST) at a ratio of 1:2000. The membrane was washed 4 times with TBST and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat-anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (Thermo Scientific) at 1:5000 diluted in 1X skim milk (in TBST). The membrane was washed 4 times with TBST. Finally, the membrane was incubated with ECL western blot substrate (Thermo scientific)  and the light was detected using X-ray films (FUJIFILM).
