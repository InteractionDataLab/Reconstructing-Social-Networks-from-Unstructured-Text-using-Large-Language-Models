      In order to achieve our goal, we first designed and constructed our circuits. Since we do not have a specific antibody for U24, to 
      better detect the expression of U24, we added a HA epitope at the N-terminal of the U24 protein, which was demonstrated not to 
      interfere with its functions <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Sullivan and Coscoy, 2010) </SPAN>. To better visualize the expression 
      of U24 under the control of tet-ON promoter, we positioned the HA-U24 downstream of a coGFP with a T2A peptide in between for 
      bicistronic expression of coGFP as a fluorescence marker and HA-U24 as our protein of interest. For our control, we used a mutant of 
      U24 whose proline 7-9 was replaced with alanine, which is not functional <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Sullivan and Coscoy, 2010) 
      </SPAN>. The entire coGFP-T2A-HA-U24 coding sequence was put downstream of tet-ON promoter. To constitutively express rtTA protein, 
      the rtTA coding sequence was positioned downstream of a constitutive promoter, human ubiquitin C promoter (UbC promoter), and put 
      into the same vector as GFP-U24 construct.
   </P><P>
      We also designed a vector for high expression of GFP-U24, with The entire coGFP-T2A-HA-U24 coding sequence positioned downstream of 
      EF1α promoter.
   </P><P>
      To express CAR molecules, we positioned the CAR sequence downstream of EF1α promoter.
   </P><P>
      The vector backbone we used for construction is pHAGE and pEF1α, both of which are suitable for lentiviral packaging.
   </P><DIV class="small-title">Characterization of U24 in HEK293T Cells</DIV><P>
      After constructing our vectors, we first tested our device in HEK293T cells for they are easy to transfect, and they possess some of 
      the key components necessary for TCR internalization and recycling <SPAN style="font-weight:bold"> (Liu et al., 2000) </SPAN>. 
   </P><DIV class="small-title">Determination of Optimal Concentration of Dox</DIV><P>
      In order to determine the optimal concentration of dox for induction, equal amount of HEK293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates and 
      transfected with ptetON-GFP-T2A-U24. Different concentration of dox was added to each well immediately after transfection. For 
      comparison, pEF1α-GFP-T2A-U24 was used as a positive control. 3 fluorescence images of each well were captured and analyzed with 
      ImageJ for fluorescence intensity 24h after introduction of dox. And equal amount of cells were harvested for western blots analysis.
       
      In the absence of Dox, the transient transfected cells exhibited low level of fluorescence, the fluorescence intensity increased as 
      the concentration increase and reached a plateau. In agreement with the fluorescence data, the result from western blot analysis also 
      indicated a rapid increase on expression level at low level of dox and soon reached a plateau after the concentration exceeded 
      100ng/ml. Thus we reasoned that 100ng/ml is the lowest concentration needed for optimal induction. However, the basal expression 
      level was high, since only 3-fold increase at optimal condition compared to no induction.       
      Interestingly, although the predicted molecular weight of U24 protein is approximately 10kDa, two bands were detected at 20kDa, 
      consistent with previous research <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">(Sullivan and Coscoy, 2010) </SPAN>. This suggested that U24 
      undergoes extensive post-translational modifications. However, the types and functions of these modifications remain unknown.

      Since our project aims to construct a safe switch for CAR T cells, the response time for our device is critical in order to achieve 
      effective management of adverse effects. Because our device relies on transcription regulation, the delay between addition of drugs 
      and the U24 reaching its effective concentration may severely limit its application.       
      In order to determine the expression time course after adding dox, equal amount of HEK293T cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and 
      transfected with ptetON-GFP-T2A-U24. Dox was added at the same time in all wells and equal number of cells in each well were 
      harvested at the indicated time for western blot analysis. The result was analyzed with ImageJ and the amount of protein of interest 
      was normalized using β-actin as internal controls.       
      We observed an increase of HA-tagged protein level over the time of 24h and reached a plateau at around 6h, confirming a relatively 
      fast response. However, the fold change was small that a less than 2-fold change was observed, indicating insufficient induction. Due 
      to the time limits, we were unable to conduct additional experiments and more repeats are needed to further validate the results.

      In order to determine the degradation rate of U24, equal amount of HEK293T cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and transfected with 
      ptetON-GFP-T2A-U24. Dox was added at the same time in all wells and cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor, was added to 
      each well 24h post transfection. Equal number of cells in each well were harvested at indicated time pointe for western blot 
      analysis. The result was analyzed with ImageJ and the amount of protein of interest was normalized using β-actin as internal 
      controls.      
      A decrease in immunoblotting signal was observed, indicating the degradation of U24 protein after protein synthesis inhibition. The 
      results were then analyzed with Mathmetica, and a fitting curve was drawn using the half-life exponential decay model. The half-life 
      was determined to be around 2 hours, indicating fast turnover of the protein, which is critical for our project that the T cells 
      functions can be restored soon after the drug is removed.       </P><CENTER>

   B: Normalized protein level of the images in A after analyzed by ImageJ.<DIV class="small-title">The potential toxicity of U24</DIV><P>
      Previous research on U24 indicated that U24 targets the endosomal recycling pathway. Although the effects are relatively specific, 
      transferrin is shown to be downregulated by U24. Thus it is possible that U24 may induce cytotoxicity when expressed due to 
      downregulation of transferrin or other unknown surface protein. To test this hypothesis, we transfected HEK293T cells with ptetON-
      GFP-T2A-U24 and Dox was added after transfection. The viable cell count and dead cell count were determined using typhan blue 
      staining. As a control, we transfected HEK293T cells with ptetON-GFP-T2A-U24(P7-9A) or Lipofectamine 3000 only with Dox added after 
      transfection, to rule out toxicity induced by transfection, Dox or the expression vector itself. Three parallel experiments were 
      conducted.      
      Growth curves were drawn for cells transfected with each vector. No significant different was seen in the viable cells count and dead 
      cells count at each time point (Student's T test, double tailed, P&gt;0.05), indicating that U24 has little, if any, toxic effect on 
      cells and can potentially be safely used as an add-on for CAR T cells. However, direct tests on T cells are needed in order to draw a 
      persuasive conclusion.        </P><CENTER>

   <DIV class="small-title">Expression of CARs in HEK293T cells</DIV><P>
      To detect the expression of CARs in HEK293T cells, we first transfected the cells with pEF1α-CAR and the expression was detected 
      using biotin-protein L and R-phycoerythrin(PE)-conjugated streptavidin staining as previously described 
      <SPAN style="font-weight:bold"> (Zheng et al., 2012) </SPAN> and flow cytometry. Untransfected HEK293Ts were used as control.

   <P>
      As indicated by the flow cytometry, HEK293T expresses CAR at cell surface. The protein L staining method is a relatively new method 
      for staining of a wide variety of CARs, utilizing the binding property of protein L to light Kappa chain to the immunoglobulin, which 
      also presents in the scFv. Since this method only detect surface CARs, it is suitable for our subsequent experiments that 
      intracellular and surface CARs need to be distinguished.
   </P><DIV class="small-title">Downregulation of CARs in HEK293T cells</DIV><P>
      To determine whether U24 has an effect on CARs, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with pEF1α-CAR and ptetON-GFP-T2A-U24. Dox was added at 0h post transfection and not added as control. The cells were stained and subject to flow cytometry analysis 
      24h post transfection.

      However, we did not observe a significant change of the surface level of CARs comparing GFP-positive and negative cells in the ptetON-
      GFP-T2A-U24 population, nor comparing the ptetON-GFP-T2A-U24 with ptetON-GFP-T2A-U24(added Dox). A possible reason is that the 
      transfection rate is lower in co-transfection experiment, as indicated in the large population of double negative cells. Since it is 
      impossible to distinguish CAR-negative cells for CAR-internalized cells, the large number of untransfected cells may mask any effect 
      of U24. Stable cell lines, preferably from a single colony, expressing CARs may be needed for this experiment, due to the time 
      limits, however, we were yet unable to establish such cell lines.

       Jurkat cell line is a T cell leukemia cell lines commonly used in immunology research. It was used in both the original U24

      We only observed a modest change in the surface level of CARs comparing ptetON-GFP-T2A-U24 with ptetON-GFP-T2A-U24(P7-9A). A possible 
      reason is that the transduction rate is lower in co-transfection experiment, as indicated in the large population of double negative 
      cells and lower fluorescence cell counts comparing co-transfected cells and single transduced cells (data not shown). Since it is 
      impossible to distinguish CAR-negative cells for CAR-internalized cells, the large number of untransduced cells may mask any effect
