InterLab
The goal for the fifth InterLab is to correct systematic variability, in order to achieve the InterLab protocol’s full potential as an engineering discipline. Our team members are excited to participate in the InterLab Study, trying our utmost to provide data helping answer the question: can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD?
During the experiment, we carefully followed the Plate Reader and CFU protocol. After days of hard work, our data and forms are completed and have been accepted by the 2018 Measurement Committee.
Main results are showed in figures below.
