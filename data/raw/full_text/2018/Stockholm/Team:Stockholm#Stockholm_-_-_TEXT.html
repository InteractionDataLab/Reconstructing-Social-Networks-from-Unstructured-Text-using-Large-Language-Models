Stockholm
One of the inspiring factors during the whole project was our beautiful city Stockholm. The capital of Sweden – sometimes referred to as the capital of Scandinavia – is situated along the coast of the Baltic Sea. Looking from the Old City into the crystalline waters reminded us of the importance of preserving them for the generations to come.
