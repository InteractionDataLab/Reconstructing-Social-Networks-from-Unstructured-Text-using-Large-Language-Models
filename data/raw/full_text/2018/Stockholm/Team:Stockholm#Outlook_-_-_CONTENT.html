In this section, we discuss future plans we have for further experimentation and development of our methodology.</P><A class="subheading blue" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#laccase">Further Experimentation</A><DIV class="innerp collapse" id="laccase"><H4>Purification</H4><P> In the span of time we had, we were only able to purify the laccases we produced partially. In order to maximize our purification, we are planning to optimize the immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC) protocol we used through optimizing buffers and imidazole concentration. We also plan to develop the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) step afterwards and try columns of a different size. Moreover, another interesting option we plan to test is precipitation procedures that might negate the need for SEC. </P><H4>Removal Test</H4><P>More optimization needs to be done when it comes to antibiotic removal test we run on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We plan to find an optimal concentration of enzyme to analyze the removal of sulfamethoxazole that can be sensitive enough for HPLC. This would make it easier to do quick analysis with other pharmaceutical substrates in the future.</P><H4>Ecotoxicity Testing</H4><P>When it comes to engineering our laccase, testing the mutant would be important to perform in the future to assess the ecotoxicity and potential effects of our mutated enzyme. Moreover, with regards to optimizing the <I>A. fischeri</I> kit, saturation of the laccase needs further assessing. This will be done through using more dilutions for the EC50 determination, as well as increasing sample size for both the transformation products and replicates.</P><H4>Immobilization</H4><P>Due to lack of time, quantification of immobilized enzyme activity was not possible. With future immobilizations, the immobilized laccases will be quantified for activity and compared with the activity of free laccases. Afterwards, optimization procedures will be looked into to maximize the activity of the immobilized enzyme.   
               
</P><H4>Modeling</H4><P>With the current second-generation modeled mutant we have, future work will focus on producing and testing it to see if the misfolding reoccurs and if indeed the catalytic activity can be increased by 10 folds. Accordingly, the iteration with our cycle can still go on to produce other versions of mutants that we modeled. </P></DIV><A class="subheading cyan" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#activity">Advancing Engineering Strategy</A><DIV class="innerp collapse" id="activity"><P>At this stage, the focus we applied was on engineering the specificity of laccases towards a specific substrate to increase its catalytic activity. We plan to look into more approaches that can also be taken in combination such as engineering enzyme's stability and tolerance to maximize its performance in wastewater. Moreover, the engineering strategy we used was rational enzyme design. In future experiments, it can be combined with other strategies to accelerate the process. Semi-rational design, for instance, is a promising approach we plan to combine and test with the method we developed for laccases.</P></DIV><A class="subheading purple" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ecotoxicity">Optimizing Product Design</A><DIV class="innerp collapse" id="ecotoxicity"><P> Immobilization strategies to magnetic beads will further be looked into. We plan to try different materials for coating and test different types and amount of cross-linking. We also aim to assess and possibly optimize our process for magnetic retrieval of the beads.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
