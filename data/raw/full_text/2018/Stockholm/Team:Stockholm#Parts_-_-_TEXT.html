Parts
This page provides an overview of all BioBricks that we have created and submitted to the iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts. For more detailed information and characterization of these parts, use the links below to reach the Registry page of each BioBrick.
Creation of Our BioBricks
We used different methods for constructing our parts. The laccase enzyme was based on an already existing BioBrick (BBa_K500002 designed by the Tianjin team 2010), where we removed the native secretion signal and added a His-tag via overhang PCR. The mutated version of this laccase (based on our modeling results) was ordered from IDT, making use of their kind sponsorship and saving valuable time. In our process of improving a BioBrick, we utilized a recently developed site-directed mutagenesis technique. In order to test our improved BioBrick, a functional construct including our BioBrick (RBS + fluorescent protein) and a promoter was assembled by restriction and ligation.
Improved BioBrick
In our project, we explored the possibilities of a site-directed mutagenesis technique called SAMURAI . For this purpose, we chose to mutate an already existing BioBrick, the composite part BBa_I13502 designed by the MIT team 2005. This part encodes a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP1) and includes a ribosome binding site (RBS). SAMURAI was applied to remove two AgeI restriction sites, making the part compatible with RFC25. We named our improved BioBrick BBa_K2835000 (see table below).
