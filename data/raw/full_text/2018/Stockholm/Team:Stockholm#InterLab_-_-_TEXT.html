InterLab Study
Aim
In earlier InterLab studies, iGEM aimed to standardize Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) measurement by determining how comparable the fluorescence measurements were when conducted in different laboratories around the world. However, they have found that when the population of cells were measured in bulk, there is still a great source of variability because the number of cells in the sample differs. For this year’s Fifth InterLab Study, we aimed to reduce lab-to-lab variability in the measurement of fluorescence by standardizing it to Colony-Forming Units (CFU) or absolute cell number. From here we hope to solve the inconsistency in measurements between different laboratories and increase the precision of fluorescence measurements.
Overview
Reproducibility of results between various different laboratories has proven difficult in scientific research. Often times, laboratory protocols need some adjustments to work in the same manner in different conditions and laboratories. The iGEM Measurement Committee has aimed throughout the years to develop and standardize a measurement procedure for GFP in hopes to have a reliable and repeatable measurement. For this year’s InterLab Study 2018, we are reducing this laboratory variability by standardizing Optical Density (OD) measurements to either CFU or with absolute cell number. The protocol to perform this analysis is provided by the measurement committee as well as the necessary parts and reagents to conduct our measurements.

Cell Measurement & Transformation
Transformations
Materials
Competent cells (DH5 α)
LB media
Chloramphenicol (stock concentration 25 mg/mL dissolved in EtOH)
50mL Falcon tube covered in foil                 Incubator at 37°C
1.5mL Eppendorf tubes for sample storage
Ice bucket with ice
Micropipettes and tips
96 well plate
Methods
We made overnight cultures of two colonies of each transformation plate. The transformation was successful and we got colonies in the plates the following day. To further conclude that the transformation was successful we performed a colony PCR to make sure that the BioBricks had the right band size.
Cell Measurements
Day 1. Transformation of Escherichia coli DH5-alpha
Day 2. Inoculation of transformed cells in LB medium with antibiotic
Day 3. Cell growth, Sampling, and Assay
Flow Cytometry
For the Flow Cytometry part we used the SpheroTech Rainbow calibration beads, type RCP-30-5A.
During the cell measurement protocol, we also prepared a sample of SpheroTech beads and placed in well A10 of each plate. After measuring each plate with the plate reader, we collected 10,000 events per well, from all wells with our flow cytometer.

Colony Forming Units
To be able to directly find the concentration of the culture, we calibrated the OD600 to colony forming units (CFU) in which an assumption of 1 bacterial cell will give rise to 1 colony. For this protocol, we used two Positive control (BBa_I20270) and two Negative Control (BBa_R0040).
This part of the InterLab study is divided into three parts:
Part 1. Preparation of our Starting Sample:
We incubated our culture for 18 hours overnight and measured its OD600 the following day. Since our initial measurement of our culture’s OD600 was high, we diluted this overnight culture into a value of 0.1 with 1mL of LB + Cam media and made triplicate for each control that we had.
´
Part 2. Dilution Series:
From the triplicate samples we have made from the previous steps, we then made a serial dilution for each individual replicate giving us a total of 12 Starting sample (6 Positives and 6 for Negative Controls). From our serial dilution, we plated only Dilution 3 (Final Dilution Factor 8 x 104), Dilution 4 (Final Dilution Factor 8 x 105) & Dilution 5 (Final Dilution Factor 8 x 106) for each of the replicate samples.
Part 3. CFU/mL/OD Calculation:
For the last part of this study, we counted the colony on each plate with fewer than 300 colonies and we calculated the colony count by the Final Dilution Factor on each plate:
Example: using Dilution 4
# colonies x Final Dilution Factor = CFU/mL
125 x (8 x 105) = 1 x 108 CFU/mL in Starting Sample
