We want to contribute to the work by cleaning water from pharmaceuticals with our enzymatic solution. We have therefore consulted with experts within wastewater treatment, hospitals and academia. Furthermore, we have gotten valuable feedback from other creatives from the field by joining the new Open Innovation platform &quot;HelloScience&quot; created by Novozymes. Here we got questions about our project, allowing us to create an early user connection to adjust the feasibility and impact of our solution. The methods used today within wastewater treatment were discussed in great details with experts, but also future treatment systems and the practicability and sustainability of our product. The key in our work was defined by talking to people within the community providing transparency and open discussions. 
The result of our meetings and people that crossed our path became Biotic Blue - a reflection of integrated influences and the community. </P><P><B>Click on the different sections of the image to learn more about each influencer and stage of our project!</B></P><DIV class="modal fade" id="kickoff" tabindex="10" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="kickoff" aria-hidden="true" style="z-index: 1000"><DIV class="modal-dialog modal-dialog-centered" role="document"><DIV class="modal-content"><DIV class="modal-header"><H5 class="modal-title" id="exampleModalLongTitle">Kick-off Presentation </H5><BUTTON type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"><SPAN aria-hidden="true">×</SPAN></BUTTON></DIV><DIV class="modal-body"><P><B>Description:</B> Our team had a long brainstorming phase to find a problem that affects people on a local as well as global scale and has the potential for an impactful solution.

Christian has worked within the area for many years, and he thought that our idea is important since it tackles antibiotic resistance. The most important feedback we got is that no treatment plant is the same, and therefore we need to develop methods to provide each plant with their own need. One idea would be to use immobilization on degradable carriers. He made us look further into immobilization, and urged us to contact hospitals for information about how they take care of their waste. </P><H5>&quot;We always had, and still have, a belief that nature is a good cleaning system itself.

These kinds of toilets could be implemented in hospitals and elderly homes, where the concentrations of pharmaceuticals are higher. </P><P>Process engineer <B>Stefan Berg at the municipal treatment SYVAB, Himmelfjärdsverket</B> was interested in Biotic Blue, but advised us to look more into the sensitivity, retention time and how many cycles Biotic Blue could be used for. <B>Sofia Andersson, Development engineer at the municipal Henriksdal wastewater treatment plant</B> thought that there might be difficulties implementing Biotic Blue in their wastewater plant based on the retention time, cycle time and the pH difference. However, Sofia thought that the implementation of Biotic Blue in the sand filters could be feasible, where the enzyme could be retrieved and reused. The meeting left us thinking about possible places and steps in the plants where our product could be adapted to. Since space is an issue for many wastewater treatment plants, this also needs to be considered when implementing Biotic Blue. </P><P><B>Thomas Mörn, process engineer at the municipal plant Lotsbroverket (Åland)</B> thought that Biotic Blue has great potential, but that on Åland it would be most suitable in a pump station before the plant. He gave us valuable information: not all houses are connected to a treatment plant, which is important when thinking about the implementation. </P><P>Meeting with <B>Elin Kusoffsky</B> and <B>Jesper Olsson, Investigation engineers at the municipal plant Kungsängsverket, Uppsala,</B> we got the insight that most plants are not developed for cleaning complex pollutants. This is the case for Kungsängsverket, but they are planning for the implementation of a fourth cleaning step to eliminate pharmaceutical residues in 2024. The methods they are investigating are ozonation together with sand treatment, active carbon or a combination of the methods. However, these methods increased the energy consumption which causes a negative impact on the environment due to increased coal production.

Sofia gave us valuable information about how hospitals are involved in the situation, and how we could potentially target their problems. Since they are currently investigating enzymatic treatments, Biotic Blue was thought of as a positive addition to the emerging field. </P><P>When pitching Biotic Blue to <B>Staffan Rosenborg (Head of Clinical Trials), Karin Sonesson (Environmental and chemical administrator) and Ewa Frank (Environmental waste administrator) at Huddinge Hospital</B>,  we got confirmation that we are on the right track with the Biotic Blue design and implementation process. They explained that there is a rising demand for removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater and that hospitals are adopting a new way of thinking by connecting pharmaceutical treatment of a patient with environmental risk information. Our Biotic Blue has a bright future, but it will also need to meet more complex requirements to make an impact in the future.

Process engineer <B>Peter Gruvstedt from the private plant at AstraZeneca</B> thought that Biotic Blue could be implemented in their fungal process step of purification, if an additional system was built on the side of the compartment, and if the enzyme was optimized for their pharmaceuticals. AstraZeneca’s treatment plant was especially interesting for Biotic Blue since the pH of the fungal treatment is optimal for the enzyme as well as a controlled temperature.</P><H5><I>&quot;This could reduce the amount of sulfamethoxazole in both WWTP effluents, the wastewater and the sludge.&quot;</I> - Pharem Biotech</H5><P>Meeting with the CEO <B>Martin Ryen</B> and <B>Domenico Palumberi</B> from Pharem, we had the opportunity to pitch our idea - Biotic Blue. Pharem produces enzymes for treating Swedish wastewater, and they both gave us useful advice and insights in the lab procedure. Martin, the founder and CEO of Pharem thought that it would be feasible to incorporate Biotic Blue before the biological treatment of wastewater since it would reduce the risk of triggering antibiotic resistance. After our meeting, we got back to revise our product implementation and discuss in which location our vision makes the biggest impact. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="modal fade" id="community" tabindex="10" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="agencies" aria-hidden="true" style="z-index: 1000"><DIV class="modal-dialog modal-dialog-centered" role="document"><DIV class="modal-content"><DIV class="modal-header"><H5 class="modal-title" id="exampleModalLongTitle">Regulating the field</H5><BUTTON type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"><SPAN aria-hidden="true">×</SPAN></BUTTON></DIV><DIV class="modal-body"><P>Britta Hedlund from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, Swedish: Naturvårdsverket) helped us to understand how the knowledge behind law and regulation is compiled, where the EPA provides the parliament with knowledge within the field. Britta got us to understand that there is no standardized way of measuring pharmaceuticals in the ocean or the wastewater. We, therefore, contacted lawyers specialized on environmental problems and the Water and Ocean department in Gothenburg. One of our most vital works in the good fight for the removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater was through the International Standardization Organization (ISO), standardizing the limits of pharmaceuticals in water. You can read more about our Standard Student Society within ISO at our Public engagement page. </P><P>Water is a necessity for our existence, and without it society would not sustain. After our meeting with Britta, our interest in law, morals and regulations was sparked. We therefore contacted Per Sandin, Associate Professor in Philosophy and lecturer in Bioethics and Environmental Ethics at SLU (Uppsala). He got us to grasp the importance of understanding how a product could be used for detrimental purposes (dual-use). He emphasized how important water is for all individuals, and how vulnerable we would be if our water sources would become contaminated.

However, they all have the common goal of reducing organic material (BOD/COD), nitrogen and phosphorus. You will find a summary of the different steps of cleaning water in this section, as well as a comparison with the different plants we talked and met with. </P><P>Every wastewater treatment plant has a grid that takes away big objects that could cause damage to the machinery. Influent matter that is separated from the water is cleaned, compressed and put in containers to be used as landfill or to be burned. Sand capture will collect incoming sand from old, eroding concrete pipes. Some plants utilize a finer grid to separate the water from bigger matter further, while some plants utilize aeration, keeping the sludge floating while separating the sand which sinks to the bottom - a step called pre-sedimentation.</P><P>Phosphorus will then be removed using ferrous sulphate, which precipitates the phosphorus. The iron extracts the diluted phosphorous compounds which are present in the sludge. Iron makes the sludge heavier, and the sludge will sink to the bottom and pumped away. Ferrous sulphate can pose difficulties to the treatment step since it has to be mixed with oxygen to work. The production of air is expensive, and sometimes unoxidized iron will continue further in the treatment and get oxidized in the biological treatment. This leads to the uptake of unnecessary space in the treatment process. </P><P>Biological treatment with bacteria and other microorganisms will in the next step transform nitrogen to nitrogen gas. Nitrogen present in the aquatic environment works as a fertilizer leading to increased algae growth in seas. This poses a threat when the temperature is low, but during summer at a water temperature of 20 °C the biological treatment works properly. Anaerobic and aerobic bacteria will work together to transform ammonium nitrate to nitrate, and nitrate to nitrogen gas, which is removed by ventilation. During winter, methanol is added to increase the efficacy of the bacteria. Excess sludge is removed and pumped back to the pre-sedimentation. </P><P>The steps used after biological treatment depend on the plant. For example, flotation by using polyaluminium chloride can be used. Another example is sand filters or lamella sedimentation. Flotation is achieved by mixing compressed water with air. The bubbles inside the tank will collect the flocks floating to the surface, separating them from the water. If the flocks are not big enough, polymers can be added. In the case of sand filters, the water is filtered through sand to remove fine impurities from the water. Lamella sedimentation uses iron chloride to make the sludge sediment from the water, further cleaning the water from impurities.  </P><P>The sludge is collected in a mixed sludge tank. Water is removed using polymers, and the sludge is continuing to a digester heated up to 37 degrees Celsius for about a month, before being used as compost.  </P><P class="legend">Table describing the different purification steps in the wastewater plants visited.</P><H4>References</H4><OL><LI>UNESCO and HELCOM. 2017.
