This has a clear benefit to the overall safety of our project. We wanted to invest in a project that is safe for the environment and society. <A class="link" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2018/2/29/T--Stockholm--safety.pdf">Here</A> you can find our safety booklet that we implemented where we discuss safety on a deeper level.</P><H4>Our Project Implemented</H4><P> The iGEM Stockholm team chose an enzyme only approach in contrast to implementing a whole cell system. This has a clear benefit to the overall safety of our project. The fungus from which our enzyme originates is naturally found in the Swedish environment. We are therefore not introducing any new foreign elements, but just modulating the quantity of the enzyme. </P><P> Although we have always taken extreme care to inactivate organisms by sterilization before disposing them, we have also considered the consequences of the engineered organism (<I>P. pastoris </I>) being released to the environment. Since it carries a gene encoding an enzyme capable of breaking down sulfamethoxazole, it could aid in the development of antibiotic resistance (if the gene is taken up by pathogenic organisms). In our case, this risk would be comparatively low. This is due to the fact that we used an integrative plasmid. Practically, this means that the genes on the plasmid are incorporated into the host organism’s genome and could not easily be transferred to bacteria.</P><P> Our vision, Biotic Blue, is a cell-free system where the enzyme is immobilized on magnetic beads that we can easily implement and retrieve from the environment. <A class="link" href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Stockholm/Applied_Design">Our prototype</A> shows how this would occur in a wastewater treatment plant. By immobilizing our enzymes we also reduce the risk of them being released into the environment. Moreover, the enzyme is not harmful to humans and other animals and can easily be pH-deactivated. </P><H4> Organisms </H4><P> In choosing our chassis we ensured that the strains we used were non-pathogenic.

Lab safety training was provided by the university and the departmental specialists. </P><P> Our project does not include gene drives, nor have we conducted any research with animals. Although we mostly used standard antibiotics in our project, our methods also involved using sulfamethoxazole and zeocin. We have properly and securely disposed of all antibiotic waste according to AlbaNova’s regulations.
