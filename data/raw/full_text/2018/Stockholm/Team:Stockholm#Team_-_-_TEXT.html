iGEM Stockholm 2018 Wiki
Team
Our project would not exist if not for the collaboration between people of different nationalities, backgrounds and perspectives. We did a little bit of everything, from planning scientific experiments to raising funds and even designing new physical products. This is us: iGEM Stockholm 2018!
Meet our team!

School: Karolinska Institutet
Program: MSc. Bioentrepreneurship
Andreas has always wanted to go to Boston and when he learned about iGEM, he thought it would be a splendid opportunity to do it with awesome like-minded people! But also, to experience first-hand the bridging of research with entrepreneurship.
Name: Blanca Campaña López
Team Role: Finance & Business Development
School: Karolinska Institutet
Program: MSc. Bioentrepreneurship
The reason why she applied to become a member of iGEM Stockholm was that she loves the diversity of the Stockholm teams, and the challenge to work on a project that could solve real-world problems.
Name: Stamantina Rentouli
Team Role: Finance & Business Development and Wetlab Research
School: Karolinska Institutet
Program: MSc. Biomedicine
What Matina likes about iGEM is that synthetic biology re-invents the way we do research. She likes the way synthetic biology opens up a more interdisciplinary field, with researchers working together with engineers!
Name: Els Alsema
Team Role: Wetlab Research
School: Karolinska Institutet
Program: MSc. Biomedicine
Els joined the iGEM Stockholm team as she wanted to translate research from the lab to solve a real-world problem. iGEM seemed like a fun challenge to her, to gain more experience and independence in the lab!
Name: Puck Norell
Team Role: Human Practices and Wetlab Research
School: Karolinska Institutet
Program: MSc. Toxicology
Puck joined iGEM Stockholm because she loves being involved in different organizations, boards and committees. She thought that iGEM would be the best one for her since she misses doing research, and wanted to meet young and intelligent people in her own age.
Name: Marit Möller
Team Role: Wetlab Research
School: KTH Royal Institute of Technology
Program: MSc. Medical Biotechnology
Marit wanted to join iGEM Stockholm because she wanted experience in designing a project from scratch and to be a part of every step of the way! iGEM is a learning experience different from university, which made her interested in pursuing the challenge - and we are happy that she did!
Name: Nicolai Dorka
Team Role: Human Practices and Wetlab Research
School: KTH Royal Institute of Technology
Program: MSc. Medical Biotechnology
Nicolai wanted to join iGEM Stockholm because he is very excited to solve a problem with synthetic biology and bring this solution from the lab into the world, where it has an impact and makes a difference.
Name: Vilma Lagebro
Team Role: Human Practices and Wetlab Research
School: KTH Royal Institute of Technology
Program: MSc. Medical Biotechnology
The reason why she wanted to join the iGEM Stockholm team is because she wants to get more knowledge in being in a lab, and also to be a part of a big project.
Name: Darko Mitrovic
Team Role: Modeling Research and Finance
School: KTH Royal Institute of Technology
Program: BSc. Biotechnology
Darko has his eyes on Boston, and he joined iGEM Stockholm – because, well, iGEM is iGEM! And because iGEM’s got pazzaz, whatever that means...!
Name: Emma Larsson
Team Role: Wetlab Research
School: KTH Royal Institute of Technology
Program: MSc. Medical Biotechnology
Being almost finished with her bachelor’s in biotechnology, she wanted to do something within the lines of iGEM. She longed for being a part of a motivated group of people, since that makes her happy – and you also get to make a difference in the world!
Name: Matilda Carlqvist
Team Role: Modeling and Wetlab Research
School: KTH Royal Institute of Technology
Program: MSc. Industrial and Environmental Biotechnology
After many years of learning about concepts and techniques in theory with a limited experience in the lab, Matilda felt that she wanted to challenge herself and apply to iGEM Stockholm. She longed for applying everything she has learned in practice to solving a real-world problem. She also wanted to grow as an engineer, team player and problem solver!
Name: Martin Axegård
Team Role: Wiki and Modeling Research
School: Karolinska Institutet and KTH Royal Institute of Technology
Program: MSc. Biotechnology and MSc. Medicine
Martin wanted to join iGEM Stockholm for a refresher on how to engineer life. Craig Venter, who created the synthetic organism Mycoplasma laboratorium, was a big inspiration for him, and he was probably the reason why he went into biotechnology. He also wanted to meet like-minded people!
Name: João Ramos
Team Role: Wiki
School: Karolinska Institutet
Program: Medicine
João wanted to be a part of the iGEM Stockholm team to get out of his comfort zone by working in a field that he is not very familiar with. He thinks that collaborating with like-minded people towards a common goal is great, and we could not agree more!
Name: Marina Martínez Hernández
Team Role: Wetlab Research
School: KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm University
Program: MSc Molecular Techniques in Life Science
Marina loves to learn new things, and that is one of the reasons why she applied to be a part of the iGEM Stockholm team. Meeting new people and experiencing the Giant Jamboree in Boston is something very appealing to her. However, her main goal is to have fun during this journey!
Name: Hanna Norbäck
Team Role: Wetlab Research
School: Karolinska Institutet
Program: BSc. Biomedicine
Being a biohacker, she has been well introduced to the world of science and research. However, she has never done it in a group of students before nor in the context of synthetic biology, which is her biggest interest!
Name: Josephine Berg
Team Role: Human Practices, Wetlab Research and Finance
School: KTH Royal Institute of Technology
Program: BSc. Chemical Engineering
It was Josephine’s interest in biology that led her to the path of studying chemical engineering. She felt that she wanted to explore more about biology, and also meet amazing people, which is the reason why she applied to become a part of the iGEM Stockholm family.
Name: Victoria Chu
Team Role: Media
School: KTH Royal Institute of Technology
Program: BSc. Chemical Engineering
Victoria wanted to join iGEM Stockholm because it would be super cool to make genetically modified organisms with your own two hands. "Who'd say no to that?" But it is also because she has always had an interest in science communication and scientific illustration and been wondering what kind of stuff she is missing out by choosing chemistry instead of biology.
Name: Simon Skinner
Team Role: Media
School: Konstfack University
Program: Graduate in Industrial Design
The reason why he wanted to join the iGEM Stockholm team was because of the creative environment, as well as his interest in technology. Being a bit of a competitor, he was also looking forward to competing with other teams around the world which is a new experience for him.
