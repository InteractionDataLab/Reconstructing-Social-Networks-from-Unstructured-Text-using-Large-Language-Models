Welcome
Recent developments in genetic engineering research has yielded promising technology, the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system for one. While it is important to push the frontiers of biological research forward, ancillary development of technology should also be kept up to date as they complement practical application towards the human society. Therefore, our team has aimed to establish a reliable way of moving Cas9 systems into cells - namely, with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs).
OMVs are an emergent mode of transporting molecular content that encompasses many unrealized powers. Our project aims to construct a system that uses OMVs as vectors for transporting the Cas9 protein and sgRNA into the host cells to achieve efficient muting of the virulent gene of interest in its genome.
This unprecedented approach would open up exhilarating possibilities for creative use of gene editing systems as aided by OMV transport.
