Part Collection
We created a novel and significant Part Collection that can be used to engineer control, production and biocontainment modules in living therapeutics.
Sense and control
★ BBa_K2660010: Glucose-responsive regulatory circuit.
BBa_K2660002: gal promoter driving the expression of TetR.
BBa_K2660005: T7 RNA Polymerase regulated by TetR.
BBa_K26600011: T7 promoter driving mCherry production.
Production
★ BBa_K2660000: penetratin, a cell-penetrating peptide.
BBa_K2660001: T7 promoter driving the production of GFP-histag with penetratin.
Biocontainment
BBa_K2660006: N-Cas9: N-terminal sequence of the split Cas9 nuclease.
BBa_K2660007: C-Cas9: C-terminal sequence of the split Cas9 nuclease.
BBa_K2660008: nMag: Negative Magnet, a engineered protein to dimerize with pMag when exposed to blue light.
BBa_K2660009: pMag: Positive Magnet, a engineered protein to dimerize with nMag when exposed to blue light.
We hope that this collection will be useful to future teams interested in engineering probiotics and building new living therapeutics.
