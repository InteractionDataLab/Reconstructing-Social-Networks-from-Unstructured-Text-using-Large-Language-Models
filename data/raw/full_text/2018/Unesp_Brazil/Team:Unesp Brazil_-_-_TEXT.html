Hope is a robust framework to engineer living therapeutics to treat metabolic disorders. Going from design, fine-tuned expression, biocontainment to real-world application, Hope offers an easy, modular, robust and open-source solution to engineer probiotics and validate them, bringing the next generation of therapeutics one step closer.

Sense and control
Fine-tuned and orthogonal regulatory circuit engineered to compute a specific input and control the expression of the gene of interest. The device is modular, making it easy to reengineer for different applications.

Production
Standardized device to drive production and delivery of therapeutic proteins in the gut. A signal peptide addresses the therapeutic protein to the gut environment, and a cell penetrating peptide drives it through the intestinal epithelium.

Biocontainment
Once the microorganism is released from human body and exposed to light, a light-inducible system based on the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery will be activated to kill the cell and destroy its synthetic DNA.

Gut simulation
To test and validate the functionality of genetically engineered probiotics, we designed and built a do-it-yourself and low-cost bioreactor that simulates the human gut and the microbiome.

As a proof of concept for our framework, we use Hope to build an alternative treatment for type 1 diabetes. Therefore, we genetically engineered Bacillus subtilis to activate gene expression upon glucose/fructose induction, and produce and secrete a single-chain insulin analog that can be absorbed by intestinal cells. Come with us to learn all about our work!
