Overview
Our goal this season was to create a framework to engineer living therapeutics and, thus, provide a set of BioBricks useful to do so. We created a novel and significant Part Collection that can be used to engineer control, production and biocontainment modules in living therapeutics. Although we weren’t able to submit samples of all of them to the Registry, we made them available to iGEM community by uploading their sequences to the Registry. Here are the parts that we created, check them out!
