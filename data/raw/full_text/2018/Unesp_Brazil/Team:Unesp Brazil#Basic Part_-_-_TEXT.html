We built important new BioBricks to engineer functional living therapeutics:
★ BBa_K2660000: penetratin, a cell-penetrating peptide derived from the homeodomain of the Drosophila Antennapedia transcription factor. It improves intracellular delivery of various molecules in cells and tissues in vivo and in vitro and represents an important tool to deliver therapeutics.
BBa_K2660003: mCherry codon optimized for Lactococcus lactis, used as protein reporter. Although we weren't able to test this part in Lactococcus lactis, we showed that works in Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli as well.
BBa_K2660006: N-Cas9: N-terminal sequence of the split Cas9 nuclease. The original Cas9 sequence is the standardized version created by iGEM UFAM 2017, BBa_K2457001 . This part was used to build our kill switch.
BBa_K2660007: C-Cas9: C-terminal sequence of the split Cas9 nuclease. The original Cas9 sequence is the standardized version created by iGEM UFAM 2017, BBa_K2457001 . This part was used to build our kill switch.
BBa_K2660008: Negative Magnet (nMag), a engieered protein made from a blue light photoreceptor VVD derived from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. When irradiated by a blue light change through electrostatic interactions. This part was used to build our kill switch.
BBa_K2660009: Positive Magnet (pMag),a engieered protein made from a blue light photoreceptor VVD derived from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. When irradiated by a blue light change through electrostatic interactions. This part was used to build our kill switch.
