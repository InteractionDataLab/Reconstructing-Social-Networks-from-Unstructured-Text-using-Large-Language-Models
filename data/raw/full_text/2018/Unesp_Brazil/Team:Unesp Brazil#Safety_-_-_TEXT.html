Safety
Lab work
The laboratory is a work environment that requires a lot of care. When starting any procedure, it is fundamental to know all the security protocols that allow the execution of the activity with the least number of risks. We are members of a team, so the responsibilities before the laboratory extend to all colleagues present. Personal protective equipment was used properly and maintained in good condition. All members of the group who worked in the laboratory were trained and qualified to conduct the trials and experiments.
Regarding the handling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), we have concerned about competition with natural species, the long-term adverse effects on human health or the environment, and the horizontal transfer of recombinant genes to other microorganisms. Therefore, we have taken care to observe the guidelines of our University's internal biosafety committee for each action taken, especially regarding the disposal of GMOs.
Safe project design
During this season, we worked in the lab with Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Caco-2 cell lines. These microorganisms are in the Whitelist and Caco-2 cells are also biosafety level 1. We used the E. coli for the cloning steps and B. subtilis as our final expression system. In order to evaluate the cell penetrating peptide that we used, we did permeability assays with Caco-2 cell line.
Our parts offer no harm for any human, animal or plant, and to ensure the safety of our probiotic we have designed a kill switch activated by light that will kill the GMO and destroy its DNA once it is released from the body and exposed to light.
