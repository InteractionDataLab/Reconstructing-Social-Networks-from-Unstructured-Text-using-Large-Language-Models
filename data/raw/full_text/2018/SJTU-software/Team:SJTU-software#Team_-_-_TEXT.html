Yangzhen Wei
I am a senior, majoring in bioinformatics from SJTU. With the interest in programming, I choose to join in SJTU-Software. As I have been in the team for two years, this year I choose to be our team leader, with the hope that my experience can help our team and other members. In my spare time, I like playing badminton and watching movies. During holidays, I travel along with my camera and have taken many photos. What’s more, I like video games, especially soul-like games. Nice to meet you in Boston!
Chenyi Xie
Hello, there! My name is Winnie and it’s my second time to be involved in the iGEM competition! I am studying in Biotechnology, so my role in the software team is to help the programmers to understand the program in a biological way. I enjoy travelling and debating, and also love to be fulfilled! Hope to have a splendid time in Boston!
Enming Yuan
Hello, I am Yuan Enming, a senior student from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I major in Bioinformatics. My research interests are data science, statistics and machine learning. I enjoy finding something interesting from data, and then applying to practice. In our project, I am responsible for the algorithm and programming. I am an optimistic person and experienced a fulfilling university life with many meaningful social activities.
Feifei Geng
I am a senior student in Life Science and Biotechnology College in SJTU, whose major is bioinformatics. The combination of biology and computer science is so fascinating that I choose this major and want to be a member of the IGEM team. In my leisure hours I like reading fictions and drawing. I’m also interested in other kinds of art; Leonardo da Vinci is the artist that I appreciate most and I really admire his creativity. It is the first time that I have involved in an international competition, which makes me really excited. Best wish to everyone and hope to make friend with you! : )
