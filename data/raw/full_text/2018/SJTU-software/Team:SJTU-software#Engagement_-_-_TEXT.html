2018 SJTUer’s Festival——Popularization of Biology
SJTUer’s festival is an annual Youth creative carnival in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. In 2018 SJTUer’s festival, we set up a booth in section of Science and technology to provide public with scientific biology knowledge and promoting their scientific literacy.
Microscopic observation
We demonstrated the public how to use a microscope and stereoscope. From Moss slice，blood cell to petal, ant…… Everyone have enjoyed the wonder of microworld. Especially, the activity attracted many children and stimulated them the exploration of the biological world!
DNA DIY workshop
We also provided public a chance to build DNA models with their own hands. In this DIY process, everyone not only feel the sense of accomplishment of building a model by hand, but also increased the knowledge. They were impressed with the structure of double stranded DNA and understood the mysteries of molecular biology.
Introduction to synthetic biology
We gave a brief introduction of synthetic biology to public, then we encouraged them write down their hope for the future development of synthetic biology. Someone wrote” I hope synthetic biology can help cure for cancer in the future.” Another wrote” I hope synthetic biology can play a role in promoting plant growth and raising the yield of crops.’’…… We were greatly inspired by these public opinions.
