Project —— Improve
This year, when we started to build our metabolic network alignment search tool, a database including metabolite and reaction information was in urgent need. So we decided to use the database, BASE, created by our previous SJTU-software team in 2015. BASE included information of biobricks, metabolites and enzymes. We expanded BASE with more metabolites and enzymes, and added reaction information into BASE, making BASE a more integrated database. Then we use this updated BASE in our network alignment search.
