                                I am a senior student in Life Science and Biotechnology College in SJTU, whose major is bioinformatics. The combination of biology and computer science is so fascinating that I choose this major and want to be a member of the IGEM team. In my leisure hours I like reading fictions and drawing. I’m also interested in other kinds of art; Leonardo da Vinci is the artist that I appreciate most and I really admire his creativity. It is the first time that I have involved in an international competition, which makes me really excited. Best wish to everyone and hope to make friend with you! : )
