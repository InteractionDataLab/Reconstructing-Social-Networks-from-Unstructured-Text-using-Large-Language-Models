iGem SDSZ_China 2018
Team Establishment
In 2016, SDSZ established the first iGEM team and became the first high school in mainland that won gold medal. In 2017, SDSZ team won China Top 3. This year, we recruit new team members. Jeff Hu, the old member from last year’s team who gained rich experience, became our team leader this year. We posted recruit information on our official We-chat  account and invited students to accomplish interview. Then we need to decide our research topic. Each of us has our own ideas and opinions, and we all have enthusiasm for biology. After an intense brainstorming and careful evaluation, we decided our project this year is to conduct research on chitin. Our team has a clear division of labor. Those who are better at academic areas are responsible for the experimental group, while the other students are responsible for the human practice parts. For example, they went to XIAN province to do field study and went to primary school to express science ideology. Each member uses their fantastic skills in the field of biology, computer science, art to contribute to the team. Also at the same time, all members participated in working in the lab. This division of labor maximizes the efficiency of the whole team and helps us finish the experiment as soon as possible. Every week our team have a group meeting to discuss our current progress and make plan for the next week. We planned every step of the project, implemented the experiment, recorded the data, processed and plotted results, and practiced oral presentations for the Giant Jamboree. Although we met some barriers during the process, we worked through them together, an in which we learned valuable experience such as entrepreneurial thinking, team work, collaboration and so on.
