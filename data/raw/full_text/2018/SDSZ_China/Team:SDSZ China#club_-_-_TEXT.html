About Our Club
The iGEM club was established three years ago, and there are about one hundred members currently. This is our third year participate iGEM competition. Every week, the club organizes events of different themes, and we have group discussion to exchange some amazing ideas in the field of synthetic biology every Friday. This club also contains students who are not from the competition team, but have great interests in iGEM. Club activities allow underclassmen to experience iGEM-related activities and develop potential team members.
