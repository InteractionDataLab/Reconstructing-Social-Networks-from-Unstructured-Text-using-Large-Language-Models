Chitin is an abundant natural macromolecular substances in the             exoskeleton of arthropods. It could be converted by deacetylation to             chitosan, which is -1, 4- polymer of 2-glucosamine. Chitosan is             significantly soluble and bioactive, being widely used in medicine,             cosmetics, food industry, water treatment and chemical industry. Treated             with concentrated alkali, the current technology of chitosan production             is deficient, unstable, squandering of energy, and, especially,             contaminative.According to a currently promising technology of             deacetylation using chitin-active enzymes, we found out that Chitin             Deacetylase (CDA) could hydrolyze the acetamino group on chitin,             directly yielding chitin, and the only industrial-available source of             chitin is the especially high-crystallized chitin from shell of             crustacea like shrimp and crab. In order to applicate enzymolysis method             to industry, separation, identification and production of             crystal-chitin-active-enzymes is crucial, both promoting             industrialization and giving instruction to scientific research.
