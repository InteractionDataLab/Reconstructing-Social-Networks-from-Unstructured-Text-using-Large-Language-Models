However, we also learned that plastic waste is detrimental to our environment. To tackle this problem, we chose to focus our efforts on bioplastic production, specifically the copolymer PHBV. As a group, we firmly believe that to approach  the plastic issue it is necessary to design environmentally responsible products. For that reason, it was essential to engage in conversation with experts in the field, from bioplastic consultants to plastic producers. As a result of the discussions with various stakeholders, the OG iGEM team designed genetically modified parts and integrated a sustainability analysis to <EM>Valeris.Ed</EM>. Thus, for our Integrated Human Practices we wanted to show how the dialogue with multiple sources shaped our project and how it evolved from the initial idea to the final project we are presenting. Following this, in the left-side section, we summarised how stakeholders’ interaction lead to changes in the design of the project. On the other hand, in the right section and organised in chronological order, we listed the consulted stakeholders and the valuable insights they provided to the project.</P><P style="text-align: justify;">The team has not only focused on how to contribute in solving the plastic problem, but it also has thought of the potential use of Synthetic Biology in other fields. Accordingly, we collaborated with other iGEM teams and organised different presentations to promote Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition in our local and international community, i.e. young students in Macau. We are happy to have spread the wonder of this world and work with the future first iGEM team in Macau.  </P><DIV class="col-sm-4"><DIV class="btn-group text-align"><H4 style="text-align: center; font-size: 200%;"><STRONG>Dialogue with</STRONG></H4><P style="text-align: center;"><BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle3">Tools</BUTTON> <BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle1">NNFCC</BUTTON> <BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle6">Cambridge Consultant</BUTTON> <BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle8">Scotch Whisky Assc</BUTTON> <BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle2">BluePHA</BUTTON></P><P style="text-align: center;"> </P>   <DIV class="btn-group text-align" style="text-align: center;"><H4 style="text-align: center; font-size: 200%;"><STRONG>Dialogue with</STRONG></H4><P style="text-align: center;"><BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle6">Cambridge Consultant</BUTTON> <BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle1">NNFCC</BUTTON> <BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle7">Northern UK Meetup</BUTTON></P><P> </P><DIV class="btn-group text-align"><H4 style="text-align: center; font-size: 200%;"><STRONG>Dialogue with</STRONG></H4><P style="text-align: center;"><BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle5">LCA</BUTTON> <BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle6">Cambridge Consultant</BUTTON> <BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle2">BluePHA</BUTTON></P><DIV class="btn-group text-align"><P> </P><H4 style="text-align: center; font-size: 200%;"><STRONG>Dialogue with</STRONG></H4><P style="text-align: center;"><BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle5">LCA</BUTTON> <BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle2">BluePHA</BUTTON> <BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle11">Biome Tech</BUTTON> <BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle10">Sinopec </BUTTON> </P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-4"><DIV class="container"><BUTTON class="btn btn-warning" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="tittle3"><H3><STRONG> MSc students in Tools of Synthetic Biology class  2017/2018   </STRONG></H3></BUTTON><DIV id="tittle3" class="collapse"><DIV class="col-sm-5"><BLOCKQUOTE><P style="text-align: justify;">During the last lecture for the course Tools of Synthetic Biology the team explained to our classmates about the iGEM competition through an introduction of the iGEM history and principles.

However, their life cycle constitutes a big challenge. Current proposals to confront this issue include recycling, the reduction of plastic consumption, and a change from plastic to bioplastic. Nonetheless, it is necessary to consider the type of bioplastic and its life cycle. On top that, it is not recommended to consider bioplastics as carbon sink, instead we should look into the circular economy where plastic is use multiple times instead of one, in addition to the design of products where recycling could be possible. The major barrier in bioplastic production is the economy of scale – the increase in innovation can only happen with the increase in production, however the current condition does not permit that due to low sales.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><DIV class="container"><BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#NNFCC">Read more</BUTTON><DIV id="NNFCC" class="collapse"><DIV class="col-sm-5"><P><STRONG>Assessing the sustainability</STRONG></P><P>Dr Adrian Higson discussed the necessity of plastics and the problems of their current life cycle. We expressed our major concerns; the feedstock materials and the sustainability of the process. As a result, the project gained great insight from the experience of Dr. Higson. He commented that in terms of feedstock, the use of agriculture materials is simple not feasible. The use of side products however is more sustainable and by using them we are making a good choice of raw material. We need to look at the energy efficiency, water efficiency, and conversion process. The GHG emissions and water footprint are not the only impacts to look at, we have to consider the social and economic sustainability of the production.</P><P>We also discussed the possible end-of-life scenarios, according to him the recycling of bioplastics and the final break of the polymer into monomers constitute a splendid way of tackling the waste problem.

Feedstock is an environmentally sustainable way to sequester carbon source. Additionally, the interviews added the attractiveness of using underutilised products from industries as raw materials, because they are more budget friendly since they are usually under-priced, however, it needs to be built on an effective logistics strategy in terms of the usage as well as the consistency of the components in the by-product itself. The downstream processing is one of the biggest bottlenecks in the process, for this reason having a method for delivering the bioplastic without the necessity of disrupting the cells would increase the efficiency of the overall production and potentially can lead to the implementation of continuous-batch fermentation which could run for more hours and the carbon source and the product can be simultaneously added and removed, respectively.</P><STRONG>Implementation and Impacts in our project </STRONG><P>First, the use of whisky by-products as raw material is supported by the consistency of their elements. Second, the logistics of using them can be more achievable as they are the product of a local industry. The in-situ secretion system constitutes a potential method for reducing the use of hazardous chemicals in the process hence reduces the environmental impact of the PHBV production. Moreover, the potential use of continuous-batch fermentation can contribute to the overall efficiency of the manufacture. The cost of the bioplastic production is <EM>not</EM> the most important factor, due to the necessity of shift from oil to bio-based raw material. We took their advice of looking more into the properties and we decided to only focus on PHBV production because PHBV is a PHA copolymer with a larger thermal processing window, thus less brittle than PHB.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><BUTTON class="btn btn-warning" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle7"><H3><STRONG>     iGEM Northern UK Meet-up @ U St Andrews     </STRONG></H3></BUTTON><DIV id="tittle7" class="collapse"><DIV class="col-sm-5"><BLOCKQUOTE><P style="text-align: justify;">We were invited to the  iGEM Northern Meet-up organised by the St Andrews iGEM team.

The results of the research in PHBV degradation and composability should be incorporated to the design of PHBV products.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><BUTTON class="btn btn-warning" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tittle11"><H3><STRONG>                             Biome Technologies                              </STRONG></H3></BUTTON><DIV id="tittle11" class="collapse"><DIV class="col-sm-5"><BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG>Paul Mines</STRONG>– CEO at Biome Technologies</P><P><EM>“Plastics: wonder materials or existential threat”</EM></P><P style="text-align: justify;">Paul Mines began the lecture at The University of St Andrews by disclosing the issue of plastic pollution and the ubiquity of plastic due to its cheap and useful properties. Plastics have been around since 70 years ago, replacing other materials and expanding the plastic market. Then he continued discussing how bioplastic products can help to solve plastic pollution by offering plant-based and biodegradable alternatives to petroleum-derived plastics.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><DIV class="container"><BUTTON class="btn btn-info" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#Biome">Read more</BUTTON><DIV id="Biome" class="collapse"><DIV class="col-sm-5"><P><STRONG>Understanding the impacts of the process</STRONG></P><P style="text-align: justify;">Regarding the carbon sequestration in bioplastics, the net carbon footprint is less and bioplastic can function as CO<SUB>2</SUB> storage, <STRONG>but</STRONG> however, it cannot help with the GHG problem in the world. Furthermore, he talked about the possible disposal scenarios such as composting, anaerobic digestion and incineration. Finally, he ended his presentation by emphasising on what needs to be developed to achieve the wide use of bioplastic. Some of his examples were: Plant science, biomass production, pre-treatment of the biomass, monomer treatment, and tests and scale up. Nevertheless, the market cannot go forward if the impact of bioplastics products to the environment and society is not understood.</P><P style="text-align: justify;">The lecture reaffierded that ‘Human Practices’ aspect is crucial in every project design and not just iGEM. Through our Human Practices journey, we found LCA tool which assessed the environmental impacts of a product and/or process, which is in line with what Paul Mines mentioned.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV><P> </P></DIV><DIV><P> </P></DIV><DIV><P> </P></DIV><DIV><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
