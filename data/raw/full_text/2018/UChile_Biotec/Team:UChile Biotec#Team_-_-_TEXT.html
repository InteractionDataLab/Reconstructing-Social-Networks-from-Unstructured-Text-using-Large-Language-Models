GET TO KNOW OUR
TEAM
Us
Our team consists of 16 people: 14 students of Engineering in Molecular Biotechnology from the Faculty of Sciences, an Industrial Designer from the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism and 2 professors that advise us: a microbiologist and a chemical engineer, all from the University of Chile. We are united by our passion towards biology and the social commitment behind this project.
We have learnt so many things during the development of this project, and we have used this knowledge to create a solution for a globally relevant problem, and to have a positive impact in our country. In addition to conducting talks and other types of dynamic activities, we seek to contribute to the extension of science, biotechnology and synthetic biology to society and raise awareness of the importance of these areas of study and work as potential tools in the search for real solutions to different problems that we are faced with on a daily basis.
Delia Garrido
Delia likes to make very awkward jokes that nobody understands. One of her favourite things in the entire world are old, fat dogs. She always works like a ground wire for the team when there is only chaos but she never loses her sense of humor.
Sebastian Farias
When you meet “Seba”, the first thing you notice is that he has an impressive beard complemented with a flawless sense of style. You will also realize that he is a very funny person and a really good salsa dancer (you will find him perfecting his moves every time he has the opportunity to do so).
Lucas Araya
“Luquitas Wachon” is the joker of the team. Although he never looks like a serious person, he is actually very smart and has a lot of capabilities to solve problems, saving us from committing tragedies in the lab. A music enthusiast, enjoys slowly fading into the bottomless pit and quantum biology. He is a good party organizer and always makes us laugh.
Natalie Edwards
“Nabti” loves to dance in her free time in one of the most renowned studios in Chile and is really good at it. Most of the time you can see Nati wearing pink clothes or thinking about brownies. She is an extremely creative person so she has very original ideas for each event that we participate in. Nabti is also good at planning ahead and realizing her ideas, a thing she accomplishes bossing everyone around.
Leonardo Guzman
“Leo” is an extremely creative person. He sleeps 4 hours each day because is always spending his time creating role games, drawings, writing novels, programming or just playing video games. Leo also uses his creativity in the scientific area to help us solve lab problems and difficulties. You will always find him writing things in his sacred tiny notebook. We tell you that is sacred because nobody has been able to look at what has been written on it, or even touch it.
Enzo Galliani
Enzo is the most relaxed person in the entire world, even if everything is going terrible he stays calm and tries to analyze the situation in order to make things better. He loves to wear black clothes, and rumour has it that if you see him wearing other than black you will have good luck.
Joaquin Acosta
“Joaco” is an extremely calm person. He enjoys living day after day. If you have a problem, you can always rely on him to hear you out and give you solutions and even back-up plans. He has developed a passion for philosophy and nature which in the end grew into his interest in science, making him study Biotechnology, focusing on viruses.
Daniel Araneda
“Leche” is a very cheerful person, he lives in his own world 24/7. He knows an insanely large amount of people and will probably end up as major someday. He is always in charge of the logistics of the important stuff of the team and is a really nice human being. A funny thing is that he is called “Milk” but he strongly dislikes the taste of it.
Solange Preisler
“Sol” is the spark of energy in the team. If you don’t find her dancing, playing volleyball or giving lessons, you’ll see her thinking in what activities can we perform to approach our project to people. She is the official team paparazzi, always trying to take pictures with the best angle and lighting. Nobody could really understand how she managed to stay sharp and smiling throughout the whole semester while  the rest of us looked like zombies everyday of the week.
Paula Rivas
Paula loves bacteria in her life. She is a very objective person and finds the flaws that nobody notices in every project or idea. She bursts your bubble of hope. Even though she’s always hungry or sleepy, she will find the time to find the flaws that nobody notices in every project or idea, with creative ways of solving it.
Camila Vivanco
“Cami” is the designer of our team. She is a really good worker and a very peaceful person. She is also extremely cute and you will always see her wearing something pink, talking about anime or sharing extremely funny memes. She always has very creative ideas making everything more beautiful in a way that others would have never imagined.
Felipe Muñoz
“Pipe” is the athlete of the team, he is an excellent swimmer and has won several medals in different competitions. He loves to joke around way too much. Usually At 3 AM, Pipe is always craving for some vegan food or trying to improve the protocols for the lab besides finishing a homework or studying for a test at last minute.
Camilo Berrios
Camilo was initially the professor's assistant in the course of microbiology. He helped most of us with the isolation of colonies and making sure we didn’t mess up things during lab, and even if we did he would be very kind to us and try to help us to make things better (and not worse haha). After the microbiology course, he was the macromolecular physical chemistry assistant. After this course, we realized he would extremely helpful in our team to help us with the modelling of our dnazyme. Long story short: he has saved our lives multiple times.
Jose Ignacio Bernales
“Nacho” was a member of the 2017 Team and but he isn’t participating this year as a student, in fact he is now one of the instructors. He is going through his last year in college and although he is working in his thesis and is super busy most of the time, he  is always willing to help the team in what he can. Oh and we forgot to mention that he is very eloquent.  Nacho is native from Puerto Montt, a city located in southern Chile, that’s why the project has a special place in his heart.
Francisco Chavez
“Chavez” is our guide professor from the Faculty of Science of U. de Chile. He is a microbiologist, and although he has a lot of work to do most of the time, he always saves us when we think that we can not solve a certain problem. He reads a lot so he always has a scientific paper that can help us with our investigation. Chavez is extremely social and because of that , he has a lot of friends and contacts that have helped and guided us too during this journey.
Alvaro Olivera
He is a chemical engineer and our second guide professor. He is from the Faculty of Physical and mathematical Sciences at Universidad de Chile, AKA the Faculty of Engineering.
