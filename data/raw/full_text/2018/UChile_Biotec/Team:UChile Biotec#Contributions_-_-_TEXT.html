We are deeply thankful for your help!
The progess made in this project and it's impact on our society would not have been achieved without the cooperation and enthusiasm of our friends, family, colleagues, teachers and collaborators that supported us through the whole journey. For this we want to recognize your role in our odyssey to defeat Caicai Vilú with the power of science.
Let's praise our heroes!
Nicolás Giuliani, Ph.D: For lending us the TECAN.
Inmaculada Vaca Ph.D & Vicente: For facilitating us the lyophilizer, thus making possible the creation of our DNAzyme papers.
Victoria Guixé, Ph. D: For giving us AMP for our experiments.
Galia Ramírez, Ph. D: For donating ABTS.
Benjamín Suárez, LabTox Director: Who facilitated us the Saxitoxin and teached us how to manipulate it.
Nicole Molina: For giving us her time to prepare all the medium that we desperately needed.
Mauricio Díaz: For teaching us lab techniques to further improve our performance and results.
