To Ricardo Cabrera for their valuable help in the laboratory, encouraging us to find coherent solution to our problems. Also we want to thank Camila Miranda, Javiera de La Paz and Nicole Molina from SysMicrolab that helped us giving some lab-tips and advices, also for their infinite patience. And Alvaro Olivera for the software management. To Daniel Carrasco and M. Fernanda Barrera from LabTox for showing us the lab protocols and teaching us more about the red tide and its detection. To Dr. Benjamín Suaréz, LabTox director, for helping us throughout our project. To Roberto Vargas, plant manager of Transantartic, for taking us to visit the culture centers. Additionally we want to thank Victor Lazcano for his significant help with all the paperwork related to the financing of our project.

SPONSORS
We would like to thank all the people that have helped us during this enriching journey. Each and every contribution has been not only a push for our project, but also a demonstration of the confidence you have in us. Without them we would not have been able to develop Tenzyme Vilu, least going to the iGEM Jamboree to defend it. ¡Gracias totales!

Crowdfunding Contributors: we would like to thank all the people that showed interest in our project, spent time watching our video and collaborated with us. It meant a lot for us realizing that there is an interest out there in supporting scientific projects knowing that we may not have that much resources, but we have the determination to create something that will generate a change in the world and thank to all the contributors we are one step closer to achieving it.
