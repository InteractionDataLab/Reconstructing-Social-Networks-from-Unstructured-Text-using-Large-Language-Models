Behavior and relationships iGEM team protocol
We realized that iGEM has not protocols of behavior and relationships during the iGEM project preparation, we think that this is very important to maintain healthy atmosphere in that period. So, we decided to create a protocol (attached below) that  each member of our team got engaged to comply all of it. We hope that in the future other iGEM teams could use this protocol to minimize problematic situations and to know how to proceed when these take place.
“Paihuen” means “to be at peace” in Mapudungun, the Mapuche language, and through that word we described the principles of these protocol.
