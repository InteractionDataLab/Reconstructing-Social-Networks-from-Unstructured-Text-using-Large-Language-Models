We think it is necessary to introduce mechanisms of synthetic biology and metabolic enginnering to high school students. We successfully held a summer camp with the subject of “approaching to synthetic biology”. The recruited senior high school students came from two cities, Fuzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian province. At the beginning of summer camp, we firstly introduce the iGEM and what we have done for this project. Then we raised some questions about synthetic biology to encourage them to think and have discussions about the mechanism and application about it. And we not only showed them some basic experiments such as gene amplification, plasmid extraction, agarose gel electrophoresis and so on, but also taught some technics of drawing plasmid map and document retrieval. In addition, we showed them our laboratory including a wide variety of experimental apparatus and how to use them.</P><P>    At the end of the summer camp, most of them expressed big interests in synthetic biology and wanted to have the chance to take part in the 2019 iGEM. What impressed us is that a girl among students participating in the camp said that although time of the summer camp is short, she obtained a lot of knowledge outside classrooms and even have a plan to be a biologist in future. Meanwhile she was desired to experience iGEM by herself. In addition, China University Network and College Student Net reported our summer camp activity and gave us a good evaluation.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="t2 col-md-12 col-xs-12"><H2 class="target" style="color: tomato;">“2-Pleasant” handbook</H2><DIV class="col-md-12 col-xs-12"><P>    From the feedback of questionnaires in the early period, we realized that the majority of people did not know about harmful bacteria in our daily life and how to prevent them, and they are unfamiliar with synthetic biology. This result inspired the idea of producing a handbook about prevention of harmful bacteria, which covers basic knowledge of bacteria around us, tips for preventing bacteria and our innovate solution with synthetic biology. To make it easier for people to read, we use both Chinese and English expression in our handbook. Interestingly, in order to attract more attention and make our handbook more colorful, we handcrafted two stereo pages to demonstrate the dangers of bacteria and function of the PLA and 2-PE.</P><P>    For a broader publicity, we made “2-Pleasant” handbooks travel all over the world. We showed our handbook in our public activities and built up good communication with other teams. Also, we have distributed it to Korea, Japan, Jamaica, etc. More and more people have a better understanding of how to prevent harmful microbes and feel the magic and possibilities of synthetic biology. They said that our handbook is good-looking and promote popular science in a more interesting and attractive form. We hope to pass on our motivation and let more people know about us and our project through it.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="t3 col-md-12 col-xs-12"><H2 class="target" style="color: tomato;"> Giving an academic lecture</H2><DIV class="col-md-12 col-xs-12"><P>    Sharing our thoughts to more people is our major goal in human practice. To trigger the interest of people to learn more about synthetic biology, we invited Pro. Zhang to give a lecture about synthetic biology. Pro. Zhang focuses on the study of microbial physiology and metabolism, application of environmental microbes and synthetic biology. His emotional lecture, attracted more than 230 students and researchers with various different backgrounds. We hoped that more people could experience the charm of synthetic biology through the education. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="t4 col-md-12 col-xs-12"><H2 class="target" style="color: tomato;">The “smell game”</H2><DIV><P>    It is very important to integrate public opinions and concerns into our scientific design and process. In our project, we do not know what the most favorable concentration of 2-PE. To seek answer and integrate people’s opinions into our project, we designed the “smell game” to get people involved, which we prepared different concentrations of 2-PE, 3M2H and some other substances to let people smell and evaluate about their feelings. From the feedback, we found 5mmol/L of 2-PE is most acceptable for the most people. The results guided us to improve our experiment.

We seized the opportunity to hold a public activity and shared our iGEM project to many people. We made some posters about previous excellent projects for exhibition and designed some interesting games to introduce iGEM and synthetic biology. Our activity finally turned out to be a great success, and many people learned about iGEM and had great interests for synthetic biology.</P><H3 style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">Calling for environmental protection</H3><P>    In the process of conducting our project, we found that few people paid attention to the unpleasant smell and issues of harmful environmental bacteria. We organized a public activity in cooperation with volunteer association, to popularize knowledge of waste sorting and appeal to the public to try their best to protect the environment, which we prepared intriguing games and propaganda posters.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="t6 col-md-12 col-xs-12"><H2 class="target" style="color: tomato;">Events &amp; Communication</H2><DIV><H3 style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">the first iGEM Eurasian meetup 2018</H3><P>    We participated in the first iGEM Eurasian meetup 2018 in Shenzhen, where we firstly presented our project on a formal occasion. For the first time, we constantly communicate with many experienced iGEMers and sought advices from experts during the conference. We also had a collision of ideas with other teams.</P><H3 style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">the 5th CCiC</H3><P>    We took part in the 5th CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Community) in Shanghai, which is the biggest gathering of iGEMers in China, with the aim to promote the development of synthetic biology and improve the connectivity and communication of nationwide iGEM teams. On the conference, we made a preview and experienced the atmosphere of Giant Jamboree in advance. Also we established good friendship with other teams and got lots of useful advice to improve our project.</P><H3 style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">Communicate with other teams</H3><P>    It is of great importance to share experience and exchange ideas with others, which makes iGEM more wonderful and helps us find out our shortcomings. This year, we have communicated and collaborated with many teams.
