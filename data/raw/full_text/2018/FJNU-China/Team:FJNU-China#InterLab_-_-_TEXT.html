Interlab
Overview
  In our project, the InterLab goal is to explore whether we can use standardized absolute cell counts or colony forming units (CFU) instead of OD to reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements.
Materials
Strain usedEscherichia coli  DH5α
Plasmid usedNegative control: BBa_R0040  Plate 7 Well 2D Positive control: BBa_I20270  Plate 7 Well 2B Test Device 1: BBa_J364000  Plate 7 Well 2F Test Device 2: BBa_J364001  Plate 7 Well 2H Test Device 3: BBa_J364002  Plate 7 Well 2J Test Device 4: BBa_J364007  Plate 7 Well 2L Test Device 5: BBa_J364008  Plate 7 Well 2N
Test Device 6: BBa_J364009  Plate 7 Well 2P
MachineMolecular Devices SpectraMax i3x
Methods
  We followed this protocol to do the Interlab Study.  All of the calibration measurements have been performed at least three independent experiments. We transformed 8 plasmids into E.coli DH5α competent cells, picked 2 colonies from each plate, and  cultured the colonies into 5 mL LB medium supplemented with chloramphenicol when necessary. After culturing the cells overnight at 37°C and 220 rpm, we used plate reader to measure the Abs600 and fluorescence of samples at 0 and 6 hours.

Cell measurement
Analysis
  A standard curve in a linear relationship can be obtained by calibration experiments. By comparing and analyzing the fluorescence values and absorbance values at 0 and 6 hours, we can draw the following conclusions: the negative control and the positive control showed significant differences of fluorescence values at 6 h. Among the six different test equipment, the device 4 has the strongest fluorescence, while device 3 has the lowest fluorescence.
Discussion
    During the experiment, we encountered two problems.   1. In the cell measurement experiment, we need to dilute the cultures further to a target Abs600 of OD 0.02, but there are always errors in the actual operation. We cannot accurately dilute the solution to OD 0.02.  So we hope that the protocol can provide acceptable error range.   2. In the second calibration experiment, the particle standard curve log graph is not a straight line. We guess that it is due to pipetting error or the time to add the sample is too long.
