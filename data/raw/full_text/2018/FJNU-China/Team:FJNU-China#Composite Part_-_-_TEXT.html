BBa_K2570011
Composite
dsrA+lacI+PlacI+hns+ProU+GFP
In our project, we combined temperature promoter dsrA and salt-concentration promoter ProU as a logical gate controlled by salt-concentration and temperature to realize the aim of producing antibacterial, PLA.

BBa_K2570009
Composite
araC＋atoD＋atoA＋adhE2
This is a composite part of degrading main unpleasant axilla odors E-3M2H(E-3-methyl-3-hexenoic acid).

BBa_K2570010
Composite
Aro10+PAR+TyrB
Production of 2-PE

BBa_K2570017
Composite
dsrA+lacI+PlacI+hns+ProU+TyrB+LDH+rocG
The promoter induced by LacI will express global regulate protein HNS, which could repress ProU. To solve promoter leak problem, our membrane provided a salt-free environment to prevent the production of PLA.
