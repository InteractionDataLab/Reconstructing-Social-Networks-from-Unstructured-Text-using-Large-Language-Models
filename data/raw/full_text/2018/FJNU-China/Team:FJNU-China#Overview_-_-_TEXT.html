Overview
    As Peter Carr says,"Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work". We think,the iGEM is colorful, and we should combine science with the society, towards our vision of a healthier, greener and sustainable world. This year, we mainly focus on infectious microbes and unpleasant smell in external environment waste beaker, and internal environment armpit. Throughout our project, we interviewed some related stakeholders, consulted with experts of different aspects and communicated with common people to evaluate our project and get some feedback to improve it. What’s more, it’s an public engagement and education that we aim to show the magic and applications of synthetic biology.
Intergrated Human Practices
    It is very important to societal considerations throughout the design and execution in our project. So we set up good dialogues with stakeholders and continuously sought input from experts in different fileds. Also we put safety into consideration.
