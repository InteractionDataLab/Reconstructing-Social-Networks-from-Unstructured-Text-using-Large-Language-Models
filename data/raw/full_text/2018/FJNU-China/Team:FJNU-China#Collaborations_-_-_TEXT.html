Overview
    We collaborated with many other iGEM teams during the course of our project. We have built good friendships and keep communication with many teams such as BIT-China, NWU-China, TUST-China, ECUST… In addition, we helped each other to analyze data, develop models and so on. We are always willing to show our sincerity in collaborations to many other teams.
XMU-China
    Cooperation on the Newsletter
    We offered XMU-China the information of our team, including team introduction, project description, etc., which will be recorded on Newsletter edited by XMU-China. Through this platform, more people could learn about our projects and we have more opportunities to communicate and cooperate with the external world.
    Cooperation on the Handbook
    We designed a handbook that contains an introduction of iGEM and tips for preventing bacterial infections in daily life. We presented useful information in a more concise and clearer way, focused on the prevention of harmful bacterial and how to maintain environmental sanitation. (Details can be found on our HP page).
    Cooperation on the Human Practice
    In August, we held the 2018 Fujian Regional Exchange Conference with XMU-China . During the meeting we share the project with each other and we have been keeping close contact. They gave us a lot of guidance on the project and help us complete in Integrated HP. They  introduced us to the hospital's dermatologist and led us to visit the Xiamen Environmental Protection Bureau.
BIT-China
    Cooperation on the Models
    After in-depth communication with BIT-China, we decided to help them solve some modeling problems.We helped them establish the ODE equation in the hydrogen peroxide decomposition model and provided them with guiding recommendations and feasibility verification strategies.Details can be found on their Models page.
    Cooperation on the Experiment
    Documented in the literature, Phenyllactic acid（PLA） is a new type of natural antibacterial substance and preservative, which can inhibit a series of Gram-negative, positive bacteria and fungi. However, we cannot personally determine the inhibitory effect of PLA on various bacteria because of the limited strain of our laboratory. BIT-China determined the inhibitory effect of PLA on yeast Cen.PK2-1C . We performed statistical analysis on their experimental data. In this way, we knew more about the broad-spectrum antibacterial performance of PLA. Details can be found on our Result page.
    Cooperation on the Improve
    Our team decided to make an improvement on Part:BBa_K2120006, but we did not find this part in the official accessories. The BIT-China team provided us with the E.coli strain containing BBa_K2120006, which provided raw materials for our improvement. Details can be found on our Improve page.
    Cooperation on the Handbook
    We designed a handbook that contains an introduction of iGEM and tips for preventing bacterial infections in daily life. We presented useful information in a more concise and clearer way, focused on the prevention of harmful bacterial and how to maintain environmental sanitation. (Details can be found on our HP page).
NWU-China
    Collaboration on the Measure Experiment
     We helped NWU-China to measure some data of ingredients in the soil. We used a five-point sampling method to sample the soil in our team's area and shared data with NWU-China. Details can be found on their wiki .
    Collaboration on the Determin Experiment
    NWU-China help us determined the inhibitory effect of PLA on Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, etc. We performed statistical analysis on their experimental data. In this way, we knew more about the broad-spectrum antibacterial performance of PLA. Details can be found on our Result page.
TUST_China
    Collaboration on the Demonstrate
     TUST_China determined the inhibitory effect of PLA on yeast Cen.PK2-1D. We performed statistical analysis on their experimental data. In this way, we knew more about the broad-spectrum antibacterial performance of phePLA.Details can be found on our Demonstrate page.
    Collaboration on the Experiment
    We provide tube of water sample from the river near our school. Our two teams often communicate with each other over the summer, during which we exchanged experience and interesting things through chat tools in daily life and establish a good relationship.
ECUST
    Collaboration on the Three Plus Net
     3+net is a new concept of the environment track, which was jointly proposed by East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST) and many universities in China. The purpose is to provide guidance and reference for the igem team and bioremediation field. 3+net separately elaborated from the three perspectives of application, biosecurity and society, and explored the relationship among the three. In order to provide more feasible suggestions for others, it is better to turn laboratory results into technologies with social value.      Base on the collaboration with the team ECUST，we focus on Biosafety plus. In scientific methods, we cite some simple methods, such as designing suicide switches, knocking out resistance genes, genome integration, visualization of genetically engineered bacteria, hardware design, network monitoring, and so on. We summarize the current common suicide switches for different types of environmental conditions. Details can be found on our Safty page.
    Collaboration on the Experiment
    Under the guidance of ECUST, we have completed the design of the LightOn switch. They helped us build the relevant plasmids and share the measurement data. In addition, they have put forward many constructive suggestions for the biosafety issues in our project. Details can be found on our Design page.
NEU_China_B
    Collaboration on the Communication
    Our two teams conducted video connections to discuss the problems encountered in the experiment. For the problem that needs to be solved urgently, we provide feasible solutions for each other, such as overlap technology for fragment connection and design of the characterization experiments.
    Cooperation on the Human Practices
    They helped us to distribute handbook, which expanded the scope of publicity and provided suggestions for handbook. We provided Northeastern University with lactic acid data and fermentation processes in the beer production process.(Details can be found on our HP page).
    Collaboration on the Experiment
    In addition to online communication, we helped each other in the experiment. The students of NEU helped us to constract plasmid proU-GFP and we help them to  constract plasmid p-LsrA-GFP. This collaboration made our experiment more succeedful.
SSTi-SZGD
    Collaboration on the Project
    We investigated the opinions of teachers on their product hyaluronic acid micro-needle patch. And we gave SSTi-SZGD our feedback.
    Collaboration on the Experiment
     In return,they helped us to test the smell of the antibacterial agent and did some promotion.
