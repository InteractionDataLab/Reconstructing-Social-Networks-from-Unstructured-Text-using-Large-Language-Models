Luying He
Role:
Team Captain
Major:
Biology Engineering
Wonderful Her:
Sensitive to things and cautious to speak. Young men, never give up!
Role Description:
She is responsible for most things that has to do with the lab. This includes designing experiment , building 2-PE related circuits, ordering lab supplies, doing experiments, coordinating lab safety requirements, being up-to-date with all the lab activities and helping out where needed. In the meantime,she manages to contact with other iGEM teams and Build collaboration with other teams.
Junru Lin
Role:
Wiki Manager
Major:
Food Science And Engineering
Wonderful Her:
She is a lucky girl in our team. The experiment she did always progressed very smoothly. The well-developed experiment provided her with more time to enter the world of wikis and gradually became addicted to it. Her thoughts in daily life are very active. Eating, watching movies, and telling jokes are all things that she likes to do everyday.
Role Description:
She is mainly responsible for the construction of the suicide switch and functional verification in our project. At the same time, responsible for the wiki production of the entire team.
Hanrong Zhu
Role:
Experimenter
Major:
Biology Engineering
Wonderful Her:
The happiest thing for her is to finish the experiment as planned.Although her hair is getting less and less, she have learned a lot of instrument operations.
Role Description:
Responsible for all the experiments related to measurement,including interlab and other experiments.
Xueyi Yang
Role:
Circuit Designer
Major:
Biology Engineering
Wonderful Her:
She is active and enthusiastic. And this is her first experience to join this kind of competition.Though the experiments are a hard work for her，she is still in high spirits. In addition，she is also responsible for team poster.
Role Description:
She designed salt and temperature switch of our circuit which related with the production of PLA in bromidrosis.
Xinyue Zhang
Role:
Lab Team, Human Practice Manager
Major:
Food Science And Engineering
Wonderful Her:
She is an optimistic and positive girl. At first, she decided to take part in the competition out of her interest. Though, the process is tough, she sticks to herself origin choice and never gives up. She is fond of bring joy and happiness to the people around her, and hopes her life is colorful.
Role Description:
She tried her best to degrade unpleasant axilla odors by a series of enzymes. In addition, she is responsible for all human practices of our project.
Yuxian Chen
Role:
Modeling Builder
Major:
Biology Engineering
Wonderful Her:
She is a gentle girl, and she often has her own ideas to suggest to the team. She has a positive attitude towards everything. Keep trying to lose weight and indulge in reading and taking notes
Role Description:
She designed and completed the modeling experiments, Modeling for our experiments.
Guanxuan Peng
Role:
Modeling Builder
Major:
Biological sciences
Wonderful Her:
She is the most patient girl in our team. The modeling experiment process is complicated and the operation cycle is long，so she is often the last one to leave the lab. She is also optimistic and calm. Even if the experiment sometimes ran into problems，she and her partner would always encourage each other and try again.
Role Description:
She is mainly responsible for collecting data through experiments， based on which, she established a series of models to provide guidance for projects and products.
