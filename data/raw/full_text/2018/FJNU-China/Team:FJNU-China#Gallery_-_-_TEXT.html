    As the first team in our school to participate in iGEM, we encountered a lot of difficulties. From the formation of the team to the final question, many friends left our team, and finally we left 8 girls to fight side by side.In the course of the competition, each of us felt very tired . But everyone is trying to enjoy the process and try to make life interesting. Let's take a look at our life now. A fantastic trip for 8 girls!
