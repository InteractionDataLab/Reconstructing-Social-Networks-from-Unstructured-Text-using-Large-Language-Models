PLA yield curve
Introduce    we have established a dynamic equation to describe the yield of PLA. Since the synthesis of PLA requires the design of enzymatic reactions, we designed the mistral equation for this purpose and reshaped it by our experimental data. This model allows us to understand the relationship between different bacteria counts and PLA production，which effectively solving the following problem: if our system can produce the desired amount of PLA?
Method    Before we built model, we had used different number of BM4R to produce PLA. We sufficient substrates for the whole reaction and measured the amount of production every 20 minutes. Based on our experiment data and the principle of PLA metabolic pathway, we select a function similar to the mistral equation to fit our experimental data.
Based on the above model, we have known that when the substrate is sufficient and a certain amounts of bacteria is input at a certain time point, with the continuous accumulation of PLA output, the synthesis rate of PLA gradually decreases. When P reaches Pm, PLA is no longer produced and maintains a stable yield.
Achievement    (1) Let us Know how many engineered bacteria should be used and at what time that the required amount of PLA can be obtained, saving time and materials to facilitate commercialization. (2) It illustrates the mechanism why the amount of PLA could be the same under different excessive substrate concentrations even through the formation rate of PLA might be significant different
