Week21    15/7-21/7
1.Did the lethal experiment of PLA against Staphylococcus epidermidis. 2.Obtained the MazF toxin protein gene fragment from E.coli BW25113 3.The MazF and PEA32 backbones were connection by Gibsion. [Result] 4.Obtained lacI fragment by PCR. [Result] 5.InterLab
Week22    22/7-28/7
1.Attended the iGEM Eurasian Meetup 2018 2.Verified the function of MazF with different concentrations of arabinose concentration. [Result] 3.Did the T4 ligation for lacI and the circuit we synthesized. 4.Added different concentrations of PLA to samples and Measured OD value. 5.Tried to obtain eGFP fragment by PCR. 6.Uploaded the data of InterLab.
Week23    29/7-04/8
1.Making a standard curve of PLA. 2.Failed to constructed the circuit of hns-syn-eGFP, we decided to replace the eGFP with the GFP. 3.Change the backbone of the plasmid hns-syn from PUC57 into pRB1S. 4.Add restriction sites for atoD, atoA by PCR. 5.Did the lethal experiment of PLA against Staphylococcus epidermidis to provide data for our model.
Week24    5/8-11/8
1.Failed to enzyme cutting pRB1s, PLA and mazF with Kpn1 and Dra3. 2.Failed to construct pRB1s-atoD-atoA by Gibson assembly. 3.Obtained GFP fragment by PCR. 4.Tried to construct pRB1s-hns-syn-GFP. 5.Obtained ARO10, par and TyrB fragment by PCR. [Result] 6. Construct ARO10, par, TyrB and pSB1C3 by Gibson assembly.
Week25    12/8-18/8
