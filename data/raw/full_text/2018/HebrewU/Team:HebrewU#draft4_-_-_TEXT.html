Highlights:
Open Source
We made an open source platform, where local researchers can take our synthetic pathway and conduct a research themselves, inserting it to local plants and other flora as well as improving it for us all.
Moolti
Our Multiple Organism Optimization Lab Tool for iGEM Allows biologists to optimize codon usage for multiple organisms simultaneously.
Gibson Brick
We created 40 bp oligos that can be used as primers for all BioBrick parts. When amplified, these “GBs” can be used for Gibson Assembly which can save time and resources.
