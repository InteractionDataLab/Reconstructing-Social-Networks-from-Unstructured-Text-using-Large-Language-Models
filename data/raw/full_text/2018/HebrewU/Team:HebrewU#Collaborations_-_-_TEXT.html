Ben Gurion University (Israel)
Mentoring and inter-lab assistance.

Ben Gurion University: Beersheba, Israel
As it is our university's first time competing in iGEM, we found neighborly mentors in the team from Ben Gurion University (BGU) - only a two hour drive away from our own university! For one, they helped us design an overall yearly program for iGEM tasks based on their previous experiences, also sharing a detailed budget plan with our PI for reference.
BGU we instrumental in our completion of the interlab study, which was a necessity for our team to fulfil our medal requirements. Our team did not meet the Interlab standards by the first deadline, and as such it was critical that we did it right for the final submission in August. BGU assisted us by troubleshooting issues we had in our first try, helped us plan out the experiment well, and even provided is with comptent D5a E. coli, which we ran out of when we need them most.
Finally, BGU hosted a meetup between our two teams which included a quick tour and presentation by our hosts, help establishing good presentation structure for the conference, and a super-fun bowling game!

Lo! My cells hath grown!
A sea of specks, like ancient constellations
Innumerable, and ever doubling.
With each cellular division so to is my despair divided, vanquished.
Before me, my happiness in tremulous agar
Oh how I've transformed my cells, and how they've transformed me!
Plasmids taken up, and with them my heart
I reach out, drawn to them, attraction inescapable
Sweet contact, pure bliss, prokarya and eukarya unified as one
Softly, I wipe away the tears of joy, of science realised
In an instant my heart sinks, my ungloved hand drawing away from my face in horror
That was last summer
Coughing, wheezing, I glance out my hospital window
And with an autumn breeze fell leaves and a molecular biologist too
Gathered round a weeping crowd
Regretting this gloveless tragedy

Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences:
Rotterdam, Netherlands
Loraine from Rotterdam took part in our exciting safety potery contest, here is Loraine poetry:
"Feeling safe can be a little hard,
You can see it as some sort of art.
Needing three hands to stay under the flame,
If it goes wrong, who’s to blame?
Wear your goggles and tie up your hair,
Doing this is important, I swear.
We forget sometimes the things we cannot do,
But there is much more danger than just the flu.
Not only in the lab where the bacteria grows,
Also outside, where Noctiluca scintillans glows.
To make something so small,
Doesn’t mean it is safe for us all.
Endangering the worldwide population,
Did you think of cell inactivation?
We live in a world with so much beauty,
It’s safe to say: protection is our duty. "

The Center for Biotechnology in Bielefeld University:
Bielefeld, Germany
Jakob from Rotterdam took part in our exciting safety potery contest, here is Jakob poetry:
The hydrochloric acid at the highest shelf,
the pathogenic organism in ones hand.
All it need is a little help
by a poor, clueless guy, isn’t this grand?
He shakes the shelf and down goes
the hydrochloric acid on the floor in a burst.
The lab member gets unconscious. The pathogen became free
I’m dead now. Well, I was responsible for the safety.
And from this point all went wrong.
Fume hoods stand open, windows too
the same old song.
Nothing I would knew.
So the first BA dropped dead
working with volatile, toxic reagent
How predictable and sad.
The second BA got health issues and couldn’t pay his rent.
So remember to think forward in the lab.
It saves multiple lives.
You neither play with knifes.
It is easy to do so do it ASAP

RFP is red
GFP is green
as I lie in my bed
awaiting for my dreams to be seen
I wake up to the thought
I begin to turn pale
as I realize that I forgot
to dispose of the agarose gel in the designated pail

Imperial College: London, England
In our collaboration with Imperial College, our team had reviewed and given constructive feedback on Imperial's  "Science Communication Guidelines" - a platform designed to help iGEM teams and biologists share information with non-scientists and the general public. We also collectively answered a survey about team communication to help Imperial develop an app that helps streamline communication between team members
