Students
Alon Barshap
Team Captain
Just a year ago Alon was only a student with a dream. He wanted HerbewU to take part in an international synthetic biology competition called iGEM.
Nobody around him had heard of it, but he wouldnâ€™t give up. He pushed the University, students, and advisors until we had a team and initial funding.               Since things got moving, he took over as team captain and had led us to where we are today.

Lior Badash
Team Captain
Lior was the second person to join the journey from library meetings to Boston. He played a huge role in getting our team off the ground and creating the infrastructure for our team to flourish.
As team captain, he has he has brought out the best in our team members. Even as he was running the team, he found ways to organize awesome projects like the Livestream and lab safety poetry contest.

Eliya Milshtein
Head of PR and Community Outreach
From participation in her first iGEM meeting, Eliya has played a dominant role in the group throughout all stages of its development. Overseeing the PR and fundraising has been no small task, and Eliya has handled it with resilience and grace.
Additionally, Eliya headed up our Inter-lab team, securing our bronze medal. Always bringing outside the box thinking to the table, she has continuously pushed out team forward.

If a cells has GFP, but no one is there to to measure it, does it really fluoresce?
Amichai BK
Student Research Leader
From our first brainstorming session, Amichai was pushing for a project in Bioremediation. Through perseverance and flexibility, his ideas evolved into our current project on TCDD.
Since we started wet work, he has spent most of his time in the lab; both overseeing all of the lab tasks and leading all efforts to do with the yeast. Though he has contributed to other aspects of the project, its hard to get him out of his lab coat, and away from the microbes.

Lior Shachar
Research Liason
Lior joined the team in January and hit the ground running. Lior is our go-to guy for information on any subject relating to the research. He has founded and kept correspondence with leading researchers around the world to help push our lab work forward.
Lior has also interviewed predominant researchers about TCDD and genetic engineering in the framework of our Livestream and human practices projects.

Aliza Fedorenko
Plant Engineer
Aliza has continuously played a key role both in the lab and outside of it. She ruled over the lab as the safety tzar- making sure we all made it to Boston in one piece.
Additionally, She headed our Arabidopsis engineering team and helped bring our project closer to real-world applications. When she's not in the lab growing plants, Aliza is designing graphics for everything including our poster and wiki.

Lea Cohen-Tannoudji
Computational Biologist
Lea joined our team from a far. Despite the difficulties of being on a different campus, in a different city, she played an integral part of our team.
Coming from a separate faculty, she brought with her a radically different skill set and point of view. She expanded our capabilities and brought MOOLTi, our codon optimizing software to life.
