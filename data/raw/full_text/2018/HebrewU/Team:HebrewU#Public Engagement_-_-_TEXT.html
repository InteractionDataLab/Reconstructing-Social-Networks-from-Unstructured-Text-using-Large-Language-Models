Human Practices: Education and Public Engagement Special Prize
Innovative educational tools and public engagement activities have the ability to discuss the science behind synthetic biology, spark new scientific curiosity and establish a public dialogue about synthetic biology from voices and views outside the lab.
On this page, your team should document your Education and Public Engagement work and activities. Describe your team’s efforts to include more people in shaping synthetic biology (such as creating or building upon innovative educational tools and/or public engagement activities to establish two-way dialogue with new communities, and/or engaging new groups in discussions about synthetic biology and public values). Describe your approach, why you chose it, and what was learned by everyone involved (including yourselves!).
This work may relate to or overlap with the work you document on your Human Practices page. Whereas Integrated Human Practices relates to the process of refining your project purpose and design, this page may highlight significant efforts that go beyond your particular project focus and/or address a significant broader concern in iGEM.
For more information, please see the Human Practices Hub . There you will find:
an introduction to Human Practices at iGEM
tips on how to succeed including explanations of judging criteria and advice about how to conduct and document your Human Practices work
descriptions of exemplary work to inspire you
links to helpful resources
And more!
If you nominate your team for the Best Education and Public Engagement Special Prize by filling out the corresponding field in the judging form , the judges will review this page to consider your team for that prize. The criteria are listed below.
How have you developed new opportunities to include more people in shaping synthetic biology? Innovative educational tools and public engagement activities have the ability to establish a two-way dialogue with new communities by discussing public values and the science behind synthetic biology. Document your approach and what was learned by everyone involved to compete for this award.
