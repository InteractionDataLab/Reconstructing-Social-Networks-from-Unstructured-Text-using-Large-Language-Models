Highlights:
We designed an open source platform where researchers anywhere can view our synthetic pathway and conduct their own research, inserting it into native plants and building upon our database.
Our Multiple Organism Optimization Lab Tool for iGEM allows biologists to optimize codon usage for multiple organisms simultaneously.
We have created a model enzymatic pathway for dioxin and chlorinated-compound degradation, which serves as the foundation of our research and project design.
