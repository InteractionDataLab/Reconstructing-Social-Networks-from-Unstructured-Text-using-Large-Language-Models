There were daily support for the experiments and directions for the project and a help since the beginning of the brainstorms. <STRONG>Jérôme Bonnet</STRONG> and his team hosted our the team at their laboratory (<A class="lien" href="http://www.cbs.cnrs.fr/index.php/fr/">CBS of Montpellier</A>). They were also of financial support for the project.
<STRONG>Hung-Ju Chang</STRONG> was of general support for the project, he especially advised us for the design and experiments for the antibodies. 
<STRONG>Sarah Guiziou</STRONG> was a support for the experiments and advised us for different aspects for the scientific part of the project. She also participated to iGEM some years ago and she gave us precious advices.
<STRONG>Ana Zuniga</STRONG> was of general support for the project, advised us for the lab and experimental protocols. 
<STRONG>Peter Voyvodic</STRONG> helped us on many aspects especially for designs, the comic book, and for scientific writing. 
<STRONG>Pauline Mayonove</STRONG> helped us on the organization at the lab, she made the orders, explained the working at the lab et helped us on many protocols. </P><H2>Other researchers help</H2><P><STRONG>Dr Thomas Robert</STRONG> and Post-Doc <STRONG>Boubou Diagouraga</STRONG> helped us on the sperm motility assay project. Thomas Robert provided us with mice from his laboratory, the CBS of Montpellier. Both of them prepared the sperm samples for our experiments. They are working on chromosome structure and homologous recombination in meiosis.
<STRONG>Dr Viviana Claviera</STRONG>, <STRONG>Dr Manouk Abkarian</STRONG>, PhD student <STRONG>Loïc Dumas</STRONG> for providing us the microscope we used and for the support on the microscopy part of the project. They helped us figure out the best parameters and debugged some experimental protocols.</P><P><STRONG>Dr Ting Lu</STRONG> and <STRONG>Dr Kong Wentao</STRONG> that share with us the pWK6 vector. <STRONG>Dr Ian Bothwell</STRONG> that share with us the pRSFDuet-1 NisA+NisB and pACYCDuet-1/NisC constructs.</P><P><STRONG>Anna-Sophie Fiston-Lavier</STRONG> (University of Montpellier) for help with bioinformatics.</P><H3>Professionals</H3><P>Gynecologists Doctors <STRONG>Elisabeth Paganelli</STRONG>, <STRONG>Claire-Noëlle Collardey</STRONG>, <STRONG>Olivier Cherici</STRONG>  and <STRONG>Laurent Vandenbrouck advised</STRONG> us on different aspects of the project but mainly the direction and potential applications.</P><H3>Artists</H3><P>We would also like to thank all the artists that helped us on the project in different aspects.
