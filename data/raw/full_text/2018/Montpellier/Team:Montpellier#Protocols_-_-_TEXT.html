Protocol :
Day 1 :
Streak the E.coli from glycerol stock (-80°C) onto a LB plate without antibiotic. Incubate the plate at 37°C overnight. The plate can be storage at 4°C in one week.
Day 2 :
Inoculate a single E.coli colony in 30 ml of LB medium. Vortex. Grow overnight at 250 rpm and 37°C. The amount of overnight culture depends on how many liters of competent cell you are going to prepare. For 1L culture you need 4mL of overnight culture.
Do a negative control of contamination with 4 antibiotics (Kam, Carb, Kana, Spec) : 2mL of preculture + 2μL Antibiotic (4 different tubes). Vortex. Grow overnight at 250 rpm and 37°C.
Prepare 2YT medium or LB medium (500mL in 2L flask). Keep them at RT°C.
Prepare the autoclaved 3L pure H2O, 2L 10% glycerol, 3 Measuring tubes, 4 centrifuge bottles, PCR tubes or autoclaved 1.5mL tubes, PCR racks, 10mL 5mL and 2mL pipettes, few 1mL syringes for Eppendorf pipette and 1 x 15mL tube. Afterward, keep them at 4°C.
Book the 37°C incubator for tomorrow (4 x 2L from 9 to 13 for example).
Book the centrifuge for tomorrow (Rotor F9 / 2500g / 4°C / during 3h).
Day 3 :
Cells preparation :
Check the negatives controls.
Transfer 4 mL of overnight culture into 2-liter flask containing 1L of LB medium (1:250) without antibiotic. Homogenize.
Do a negative control of contamination with 4 antibiotics (Kam, Carb, Kana, Spec): 2mL of culture + 2μL Antibiotic (4 different tubes). Vortex. Grow overnight at 250 rpm and 37°C.
For the culture in 4 x 2-liter flask (500mL/flask) with a sterilized 500mL measuring tube.
Incubate at 250 rpm and 37°C until the OD600 is about 0.5 ~ 0.6 (~4h) (To measure the OD, do the blanc with 1mL LB medium).
Note : For NEB10β, it takes about 4 hours to reach OD 0.52. You should check the OD of your culture after 3 hours and 30 minutes incubation time.
After OD is reached, pour the culture into 4 pre-chilled 500 ml centrifuge bottles.
Balance the weight of the bottles with the culture and chill it on ice for 30 min.
Keep flasks as waste.
Note : From here on, everything should be kept on ice, in the cold room and done as rapidly as possible.
Cool down the centrifuge at 4°C.
Spin at 2500g for 20 min at 4°C.
Decant the sup in a “Flask –waste”. Be careful, always dry the pellet the most of possible and don’t touch the flask with the bottle.
Use a sterilized 250mL measuring tube. Re-suspend cell pellet by hand and quickly, don’t use vortex in 250mL/bottle of pre-chilled pure H2O. You can pool it in 2 bottles (2 x 500mL) equilibrate and then spin at 2300g for 10 min at 4°C.
Decant the sup in a “Flask – waste”.
Use the same sterilized 250mL measuring tube and re-suspend cell pellet as step 12, in 250mL/bottle of pre-chilled pure H2O, and then spin at 2300g for 10 min at 4°C.
Decant the sup in a “Flask – waste”.
Use a sterilized 250mL measuring tube and re-suspend cell pellet as step 12, in 250 mL/bottle of pre-chilled 10% glycerol, and then spin at 2300g for 10 min at 4°C.
Note : Take care when decanting because the cells lose adherence in 10% glycerol. Perform this right after centrifugation can reduce the lost.
Repeat step 16 for two times with 100mL/bottle of pre-chilled 10% glycerol.
18.Carefully decant the sup and re-suspend cells in the remaining volume (about 1 ~ 2 mL) with E.coli electrocompetent cells preparation and transformation with 2mL pipette. (If it’s not possible, add 500μL glycerol 10% and re-suspend the pellet.) Transfer it in the 15mL cold tube.
Note : This is best done by gently swirling rather than vortex. Or use plastic drop for gently flushing.
Measure the OD600 of a 0, 5:100 dilution of the cell suspension. 5μL culture + 995μL H20, mix, mesure. The spectrophotometer can measure only until OD600 = 1.0 (If the measure is too high, dilute it of a 1:2 dilution).
1.0 OD600 = ~2.5 x 108 cells/mL. For High efficiency we need OD600 = 150–200.
Aliquot immediately by 80μL into 1.5mL tubes, drop into a bath of liquid nitrogen, and transfer to -80°C for storage.
For Gibson assembly we need OD600 = 80.
Do a negative control of contamination with 4 antibiotics (Kam, Carb, Kana, Spec): Add 8mL LB medium in the 15mL Tubes with few μL of re-suspended pellet, Pour in 4 tubes (2mL/tube) + 2μL Antibiotic / tube. Vortex. Grow overnight at 250 rpm and 37°C.
Day 3 or 4 :
Cells transformation by electroporation and efficiency test :
Pre-warm the SOC medium at 37°C. Pre-warm the plate contain selection antibiotics in 37°C for 1 hour.
Pre-chilled cuvettes (Bio-rad, 0.1 or 0.2 cm) on ice for 5 minutes before adding the cell/DNA mixture.
Thaw the electrocompetent cells on ice. Add a) 100 pg of pUC19 control plasmid (2μL at 50pg/L) for efficiency test (it’s possible to do it with 1μL just take it in consideration when you do the efficiency calculation), or b) 5 μL of your DNA sample for experiments, or d) 1μL of Gibson Assembly product in 40 μl of the thawed competent cells, mix by gently pipetting, and transfer to the pre-chilled cuvette. Stand for 1 min.
Perform electroporation by Bio-Rad GenePluser, Ec1 for 0.1 cm cuvette (brown) and Ec2 for 0.2 cm cuvette(green). (EC1, Bacteria = 1.8Kv and 6ms for Blanc or without cell). Flush the cuvette immediately with 1mL 37°C pre-warmed SOC medium and transfer to a 12mL culture tube. Recover for 1h at 37°C, 200 rpm shaking.
Wash cuvettes with ethanol and after water two times.
For efficiency test :
Perform serial dilution. Dilute 10μL of the culture in 990μL LB, then plate 100μL on LB Ampi plate (= 10-3).
Dilute 10μL of -3 in 990μL LB, then plate 100μL on LB Ampi plate (= 10-5)
(pUC19 = Ampi resistant)
In experiment :
Plate 100μL on a plate. Centrifuge the culture, throw 800μL, and plate the pellet resuspend in the 100μL SN.
Incubate Over Night at 37°C.
Day 4 :
Calculate the competency in colonies.
Ex : On the 10-3 plate we have 27 colonies = 2,7.104 UFC/mL (in our tube after electroporation)
2μL pUC19 = 100pg = 2,7.104 UFC
100ng = 2,7.107 UFC
Efficiency 2,7.108 UFC/μg pUC19
Trouble shooting :
Low colony number of pUC19 transformed plate :
Check the DNA quality and quantity. The OD 260:230 should be higher than 1.6 at least.
Check the preparation procedure of competent cells. Especially the cell concentration. The OD600 of 100-fold dilution of competent cell should higher than 1 at least.
Check the cuvette. Rusted or additional water on its surface ?
Check the voltage and time constant. The typical time constant is 4.8 to 5.1. If the time constant is lower than 4.5 ms, check your DNA preparation procedure. You should elute your DNA by pre-warmed H2O.
Your sample volume should be less than 5λ in 50λ transformation reaction to prevent the dilution of competent cell concentration.

Sperm analysis protocols
General experimental procedure
For each experience the spermatozoa were diluted to a 1/100 concentration. This dilution allows us to individually track spermatozoa in the video and avoid crowding whereas still having a significant number of spermatozoa. A total volume of 20µL of the sample is put on the slide. This volume was calculated to have a height of sample bigger that spermatozoa heads while reducing the proportion of cells in different focal planes
The microscope used was an Olympus IX71 with magnificence 20x ; 1000µs of exposure time. The camera used for the recording was a Phantom MIRO 320 vision research with 768x430 of resolution and 60 FPS. For each sample, 5 videos of 10 seconds were recorded.

Protocol :
Calculate the volume of insert and vector to mix in the Gibson Assembly reaction. For 2 fragment assembly (one insert and one vector), the optimum is to mix 100ng of vector with 3 times more insert in mole, and for more than 2 fragment assembly, 100ng of vector with same quantity of each insert in mole. The total volume of insert(s) and vector have to be 10μL or less, if the calculated total volume is higher, the quantity of vector can be reduced up to 50ng and the volume of insert calculated accordingly.
Mix the vector and insert(s) fragments according to previously calculated proportions with 10μL of the Gibson Assembly Mix and adjust the total volume of the reaction to 20μL with water. As negative control of assembly, mix the vector alone in the same proportion than previously with 10μL of Gibson Assembly Mix and adjust the total volume of the reaction to 20μL with water.
Place the reactions at 50°C during one hour
Note : For a better conservation of your Gibson Assembly reaction at room temperature you can incubate your reaction 10min at 80°C.

Glycerol stock preparation
Principle :
Freezing is an efficient way of storing bacteria. Glycerol allows to reduce the harmful effect of ice crystals                         of bacteria which can damage cells by dehydration caused by a localized increase in salt concentration leading to denaturation of proteins. Additionally, ice crystals can also puncture cellular membranes. Glycerol as a cryoprotectant depresses the freezing point of bacterial cells, enhancing supercooling. It does so by forming strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules, competing with water-water hydrogen bonding. This disrupts the crystal lattice formation of ice unless the temperature is significantly lowered. The final concentration have to be no more than 20%.

Twist DNA resuspension
Materials :
Centrifuge
10mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0
PRC tubes to aliquot the DNA resuspended
Protocol :
Upon receipt, briefly centrifuge the tube or plate and add without mixing nuclease-free 10mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 to the desired concentration : in 96-well plate add 10μL buffer. We do not recommend resuspension in water
Wait for 3 to 4 hours at RT
Resuspend by pipetting and briefly centrifuge if needed
Prepare aliquots of the stock dilution and separate working aliquots to limit chances of contamination and to reduce the number of freeze/thaw cycles. Use working aliquots as soon as possible after preparation and minimize exposure to high temperatures. (Keep the mother plate in case you need it after)
For long-term storage (up to one year), freeze DNA at -20°C. For even longer storage, freeze DNA at -80°C
Cleaning procedures
Cleaning procedure for beads
Used beads should be placed in recipient with bleach before washing.
Put the beads (without the bleach) in a bucket.
Add new bleach and water to cover all of the beads, wait 30min for full decontamination.
Remove the bleach, place the beads in a clean bucket and add water. Mix beads and water to be sure that all beads have been in contact with the water.
Re-iterate the previous step.
Perform twice step 3 with deionized water instead of water.
Perform once step 3 with ethanol 70%.
Remove ethanol.
Clean your bench.
Dry beads using paper (place paper on your bench, smoothly put beads on it and use paper to dry them).
Place beads into small bottles (you can use the paper as a funnel).
Autoclave the bottles (you can just add autoclave tap and place them on kitchen table).
Cleaning procedure for electroporation cuvettes
Materials :
Dirty Gene Pulser / MicroPulser Electroporation cuvettes
2 500mL beakers
1L of 70% ethanol
Protocol :
Arrange the cuvettes side by side in two beakers identified A and B.
Fill cuvettes with 70% ethanol.
Add other lying cuvettes and remove the caps on top.
Fill the beakers up to 500mL with ethanol. Warning : all cuvettes must be filled.
Cover the beakers of double aluminum foil.
Sonicate the beakers alternatively 15min A, 15min B, 15min A, 15min B, in the sonication bath.
Cool on the bench overnight.
Empty the ethanol from the beaker by opening minimally the aluminum foil (to avoid contamination).
Make 5 to 8 holes in the aluminum of each beakers with a syringe needle to create a ventilation.
Dry the cuvettes in their beakers in an oven at 65°C (2 days or more).
When the tanks and caps are dry, close them under sterile condition (flame or under the hood).
Cleaning procedure for 96 wells plates
Clean recommandation :
96 wells plate should be clean just after usage (at least in the 48h). Afterward cells tend to precipitate and it starts to be trickier to well clean them. If 96 well plates are store for a long time before cleaning, it is important to carefully control the plate after cleaning. Do not hesitate to throw plate which are not perfectly clean (and white).
Protocol :
Throw the liquid culture from the plate in a bucket and add bleach to it. After 30min, throw the liquid to the sink and clean the bucket and the sink.
Place the plate to a bucket and add bleach mix to water to completely fill the plate. Wait 30min for complete decontamination of the plate. (do not wait several days, it obstructs the sink and the plate will turn yellow with time).
Remove the bleach.
Clean the plate with water, repeat this step twice. You can use the tap to add water specifically to each well. Remove as much as possible liquid from the plate between two rounds of cleaning by manually shaking the plate.
Clean the plate with deionized water, repeat this step twice.
Clean the plate with ethanol, repeat this step twice.
Remove liquid from the plate and let it dry on paper in the reverse orientation during at least one day (depending the external temperature and humidity percentage).
Control the quality of the cleaning, if the plate is not perfectly clean: throw it, if it is clean, place it on the shelf with it friends.
