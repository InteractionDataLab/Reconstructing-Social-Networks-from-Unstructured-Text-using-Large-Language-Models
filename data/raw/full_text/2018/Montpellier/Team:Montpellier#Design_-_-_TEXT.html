General design
Each of our constructions contained rpsU promoter [8] which is a Lactobacillus jensenii strong promoter.  This RpsU sequence also contains the putative sequence for the RBS We added spacers to all of our constructions to unable easier use of the sequence and separation of the different genes of the sequences. We used two Terminators to our sequences :BBa_B0014 & BBa_B0015 to ensure the stopping of the transcription.  Our constructions were assembled in the Plem415 vector by Gibson Assembly method. Plem 415 is a plasmid that works in Lactobacilli species but itâ€™s not specific to L. jensenii [9]
SubtilosinA
Lacticin 3147
This circuit was made from 2 native genes of Lactococcus Lactis ltA1 and ltnA that express Lacticin peptide. Also, the design contains Lacticin-post-transcriptional regulator ltM1 and M2. A promoter orthogonal was used : ptsH and differents spacer taken from igem_parts.
LL-37
The design of LL-37 is simpler than the one of the other peptides. Indeed, the protein is coded only with the well-named gene LL-37.
