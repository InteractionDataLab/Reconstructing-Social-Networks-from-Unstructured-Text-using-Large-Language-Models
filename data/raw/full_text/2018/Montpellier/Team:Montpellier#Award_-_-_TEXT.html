Education and Public Engagement
We worked on different projects to teach people about synthetic biology and to explain the project. We participated in different events to talk about biology and explain people what synthetic biology is. We taught highschool students lessons about biology and gave a practical class. We worked with artists for our Instagram account and for an event to explain biology subject through the eyes of the artists. Finally we created a comic book to popularize subjects as contraception and the vaginal flora.
Thanks to all this work we were able to win the iGEM Education and Public Engagement award in the overgraduate section.
