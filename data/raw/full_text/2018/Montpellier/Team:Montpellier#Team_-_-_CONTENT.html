She is responsible for the good atmosphere in the lab with her music and party stories. Also her knowledge of Synthetic Biology is very helpful for the team throughout the months.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="team"><DIV class="texte"><H2>Elsa Fristot</H2><P>Elsa is studying drug engineering at the Faculty of Pharmacy.

Doing a Master Degree in Biophysics he is always enthusiastic for doing Molecular Biology in the lab which allowed him to get away from his computer for some times (even though he would quickly go back to it). He always has an anecdote to tell during lunch times.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="team"><DIV class="texte"><H2>Leo Carrillo</H2><P>Léo is the best team manager we could have ever hoped for.

He never hesitates to tell us how much the things that we do here seem weird to him. He is the main reason lab working is fun for us. He always has a fun story to say and some of his sentences became very popular in the team. His knowledge of molecular biology helped us in many occasions.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="team"><DIV class="texte"><H2>Maxime Heintzé</H2><P>Maxime is a curly-haired longboard-rider Biotechnology student.
