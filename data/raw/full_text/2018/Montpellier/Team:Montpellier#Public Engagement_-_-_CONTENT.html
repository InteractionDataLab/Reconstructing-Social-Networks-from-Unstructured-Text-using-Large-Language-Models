In this section, we elaborate on the different events and how we used them to promote learning and engagement in the community.</P><H3>Presentation to our scientific peers: Feedback from the community</H3><P>Before and after the bulk of our wet lab research during the summer, we presented our project to our colleagues at our host institution, the Centre de Biochimie Structurale (Center for Structural Biology) in Montpellier, for feedback.  Additionally, we presented at the end of the summer to the DGIMI lab (Diversity Genomes &amp; Insect Microorganisms Interactions, INRA) to further refine our scientific presentation skills and to obtain additional feedback from scientists in a broad range of sub-disciplines.</P><H3>Fête de la Science</H3><P>On October 5<SUP>th</SUP> and 6<SUP>th</SUP>, we participated in the ‘Fête de la science’ at the Faculty of Education at the University of Montpellier,  a large, annual nationwide event to promote interaction between the public and the scientific community. There, we taught 10-15 year old students and their parents about DNA, bacteria, and genetically modified organisms.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class="underline">Figure 1:</SPAN> Poster explaining synthetic biology to children and the public.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>We brought several teaching aids with us, including a model of a DNA double helix, posters explaining synthetic biology (Figure 1), and a small game where the children would need to arrange promoters, ribosome binding sites, genes, and terminators to construct a complete ‘sentence’.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class="underline">Figure 2:</SPAN> Plate with bacteriART, <I>E. coli</I> producing mKate2 and sfGFP.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Additionally, to spark visual interest and foster interaction, we brought several Petri dishes with bacteria. Some were without antibiotics and contained swabs from different parts of the body to visually illustrate the microbiome; others contained works of bacteriART (Figure 2), drawings using <I>E. coli</I> expressing either mKate2 or super-folder GFP to draw in passersby with their bright colors. While we enjoyed explaining our project and synthetic biology to the community (Figure 3), we were incredibly impressed the number of thoughtful questions we received and the depth of curiosity people showed about synthetic biology. Even the parents were interested in learning more about our Vagineering project!</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class="underline">Figure 3:</SPAN> Our booth at the ‘Fête de la Science’ in the Montpellier Science Village.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H3>Organizing High School-Level Lecture and Lab Practical</H3><P>In collaboration with the iGEM team from the Sorbonne University, we also organized and participated in two lectures for a high school class, with a corresponding lab practical. In the first class, we presented an overview lecture about DNA and mutations with a hands-on practical lab component (Figure 4).  During the lecture, we explained how DNA is copied and transferred between generations and how subsequent interference can lead to mutations. This was coupled with experiments where yeast were exposed to UV rays for different durations. This showed them the changing of color of some colonies (we used Ade2 mutant that were originally red and got back to a white color) and the difference of number of colonies  During the second class the following week, we analyzed the results of the experiment with the students, followed by an introductory lecture on synthetic biology and our iGEM project. We hope to have kindled some interest in their young minds to join  the next generation of iGEMers.</P><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class="underline">Figure 4:</SPAN> Pictures of the class.</FIGCAPTION><H3>Synthetic Biology Workshop, a feedback from students</H3><P>On October 10<SUP>th</SUP>, we presented a lecture on the principles of synthetic biology our Vagineering project to two classes of master’s degree students: one studying Health Biology/Bioproduction and the other Host Microorganism interactions (Figure 5).</P><P>Over 90 minutes, we covered an overview of synthetic biology, techniques used in both wet lab and modeling, and an account of our Vagineering project and the iGEM competition in general.</P><P>As many of these students could be future iGEMers as early as next year, we sought to spark their interest in not only the opportunity to conceive of and pursue a research project but also our efforts to popularize our project and interact with the community at large.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class="underline">Figure 5:</SPAN> Lecture on Host Microorganism Interactions to Master 1 students at the University of Montpellier.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H3>Press Coverage</H3><P>Smile, you're on camera!  The promotion of our iGEM project is important for fostering awareness of our project. As the first iGEM team to come from Montpellier, we were fortunate to be interviewed by several publications of the print and news media.</P><P>June 6, 2018: <STRONG>EUSynbioBeta</STRONG>

We deliberately sought out non-scientific artists in the community to help us with so that they might provide a unique perspective to help us bridge the gap between ourselves and members of the community.  The aim of this work is to educate members of the community to the existence of the vaginal microbiota/flora and the vulva through visual media with non-scientific artists.</P><H3>Social media</H3><P>Artists from different backgrounds produced artwork about their ‘vision of the vulva’, the vagina, and their microbiota.</P><P>We gave prompts to the artists and let them express their creativity starting from that.
For exemple, to the question: <STRONG>What is your vision of a vaginal flora?</STRONG>
