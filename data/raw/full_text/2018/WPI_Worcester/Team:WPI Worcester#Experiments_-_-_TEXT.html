2 flat bottom 96 well tissue culture plates
0.1% crystal violet (0.2g crystal violet in 200mL water)
33.6 mL 30% acetic acid
Protocol
Note: steps 4-9 should be done within the sterile field of an ethanol-cleaned lab bench under a Bunsen burner to minimize contamination.
Add 10 mL LB in 50 mL tubes
Pick one colony from each plate (DH5α, EMG-2Kλ, NCTC 9001, S. epidermidis, S. aureus) and put one in each 50 mL tube.
Tighten caps then loosen a half turn. Tape the cap on, then incubate in the shaker overnight at 37°C and 175 RPM. CHECK SPECIFICATIONS
Dilute all cultures except NCTC 9001 1:20 (0.5mL culture, 9.5 mL M9) in 15mL conical tubes. Dilute NCTC 9001 1:10 (1mL culture, 9mL M9).
Check OD600 of each culture, using a blank of 1:20 LB in M9. (0.25mL LB in 4.75mL M9 is sufficient.)
Adjust OD600 to 0.1 using M9 for a total of 10mL, combining diluted culture and M9 into 5 new conical tubes.
Check OD600 again to verify it is 0.1.
Pipet 100μL of the OD600= 0.1 solution of DH5α into each of the first 6 wells of the first row of each of the four plates. Repeat with the next four strains and the next four rows.
Pipet 100μL of M9 into the first 6 wells of the sixth row of each of the four plates.
Set two of the plates in the incubator at 37°C. Leave the other two on the lab bench.
After 48 hours, take one plate from the incubator and one plate from the bench.
Rinse each plate two to three times with distilled water.
Pipet 125μL of 0.1% crystal violet into each well previously containing liquid (rows A-F, columns 1-6 of both plates).
After 10 minutes, rinse both plates with distilled water three to four times.
Pipet 200μL of 30% acetic acid into each well previously containing liquid (rows A-F, columns 1-6 of both plates).
Pipet up and down four times then transfer 100mL of each well from the room temperature plate into the corresponding well in a flat bottom 96 well plate. Repeat for the 37°C plate, but transfer into the empty wells (A7 - F12) on the right side of the same flat bottom 96 well plate.
Pipet 100μL of 30% acetic acid into each well of row G of the flat bottom 96 well plate.
