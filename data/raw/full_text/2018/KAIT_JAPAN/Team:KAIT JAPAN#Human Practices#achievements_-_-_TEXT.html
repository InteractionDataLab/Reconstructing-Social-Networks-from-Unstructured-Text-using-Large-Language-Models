Integrated Human Practices
We talked with Bielefeld University in Germany who was conducting a survey on Dual use at Skype. Through this       discussion, we realized that the danger of military diversion such as dual use is unexpectedly known among       those who do genetic modification such as iGEMer. In addition, this opportunity was very important in thinking       about teaching to the general public understandably that even a small proportion of us know less.
As a result of feeding back to the classes and experience experiences I did afterwards, We were able to see an       improvement in the interest of interest that Dual-use should be made more open to the general public.
