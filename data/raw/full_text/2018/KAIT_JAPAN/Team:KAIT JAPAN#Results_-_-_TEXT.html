Overview
We planned to make 4 new basic parts. We were able to complete two parts out of them. Two things that could be completed are BBa_K 2821002 Promoter (RhlR + C4 - HSL inhibited - 1), BBa_K 2821003 Promoter (RhlR + C4 - HSL inhibited - 2).
PCR
As a result of performing colony PCR after ligation, it was judged that the ligation of BBa_K 2821002, BBa_K 2821003 was successful since the band appeared at the total position of the spacer sequence and the target sequence.
