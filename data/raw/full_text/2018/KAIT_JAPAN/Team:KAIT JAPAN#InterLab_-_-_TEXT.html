Interlab
Overview
This page shows KAIT_JAPAN's contribution to the Fifth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study the fifth Interlab.
There are two goals of fifth Interlab:
1. Reducing lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD using two orthogonal approaches.
2. Converting between absorbance of cells to absorbance of a known concentration of beads and CFUs from the sample.
Protocol
We followed the protocol given.
