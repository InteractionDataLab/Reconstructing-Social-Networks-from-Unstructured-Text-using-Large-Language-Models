          society. In order to make use of the technology of synthetic biology in a wide range of societies, we thought
          that it is indispensable to have fundamental understandings from sociologists, executives and other sectors
          in completely different fields, besides scientists. Our approach to human practice is to know the current
          situation of people trying to learn something related to biology from now on and to do classes based on that
          feedback and to those who did not take classes It was to do consciousness reform that intends to teach
          interest and basic knowledge to.</P><P>There are three targets set up to achieve this goal.</P><UL><LI>1. To know the image and awareness of current genetic modification.</LI><LI>2. Check the validity of the questionnaire result.</LI><LI>3. Confirm changes in consciousness by feedbacking questionnaires and exchanges with other universities
            to the class.</LI></UL><H2>Humanplactice for Silver</H2><P>Last year, in a questionnaire targeting a broad age from 10 to 70 years, Japanese were statistically showing
          resistance to genetic modification. However, this year, it was found that the questionnaire which was
          conducted for high school students and people around 20 years old in university, and resistance to genetic
          modification are low.</P><P>With the reduction of research expenses, as the voice of the educational environment at Japanese
          universities is getting worse, it is extremely dangerous for people who use these technologies to look only
          to the convenience in the future We planned a lecture by focusing on ideas and targeting young people such as
          high school students.</P></SECTION><SECTION><P>
          On September 4th and 5th, we also participated in an international symposium on science and technology and
          education. As a result of discussion within the team, we thought we needed to know the relationship between
          genetic engineering technology and military diversion problem.
