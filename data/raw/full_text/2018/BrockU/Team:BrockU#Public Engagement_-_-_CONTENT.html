        The BrockU iGEM team made significant efforts this year to encourage and promote the exploration of science to students among varying levels of education and to members of our community. Our team was particularly focused on engaging with students in elementary school, as they are young, impressionable and very curious. Throughout our endeavours, we focused on keeping an open and clear dialogue in order to bridge the communication gap between our research and the intrigue of our community. 
       
        Please see below for the specific ways in which we spread scientific enthusiasm to our community.

        One of our members, Marvel (featured on the right), volunteers at the Brock Research and Innovation Centre, where she assits members who have spinal cord injuries and neurological disorders exercise to improve their motor abilities.  Through that position, she also promotes research participation and literacy by informing members of the ongoing research projects at Brock, including the iGEM project, as well as how they can contribute.  Many research projects require participation from people with spinal cord injuries or neurological disorders so these members are very important to reach. Many members participate in research at Brock as a result.

       Our team presented our 2018 iGEM project at the annual oGEM conference hosted by McMaster University.  It was a great day of receiving and giving feedback on projects to the other teams that attended. This allowed us to grow as a team while making connections with other teams and sharing our knowledge with them.

        The Brock iGEM team presented our findings to the Brock University Studentsâ€™ Administrative Council (BUSAC), an elected student body government, to raise awareness and gain support for the Brock iGEM team. The presentation was an overwhelming success, with many BUSAC members giving their support to the iGEM team for this year, and in the future!
