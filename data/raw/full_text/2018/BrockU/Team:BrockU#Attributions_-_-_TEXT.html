Team Achievements
Transforming pCDF-Duet-1 into Electrocompetent Cells. We used electrocompetent DH5α E. coli cells to amplify and plasmid extract the pCDF-Duet-1 plasmid. Robert, Raymond, Jenna, Sam, Michael, and Marvel were involved in this procedure.
Primer Design. We used the ApE software as well as the NEB Tm Calculator to design primers for the amplification of the native Flippase gene; as well as the FLPA, FLPB, pMag, and nMag fragments. Robert, Raymond, Jenna, Sam, Michael, and Marvel were involved in this procedure.
Restriction Enzyme Digest of pCDF-Duet-1. pCDF-Duet-1 was cut using the two restriction enzymes, NcoI and NotI. This enabled for subsequent Gibson Assembly. Sam, Michael, Matteo, and Marvel were involved in this procedure.
Amplification of the Flippase Gene. Using the primers created previously, we used PCR to amplify the flippase gene. The flippase fragment will be inserted into pCDF-Duet-1. Sam, Michael, and Marvel were involved in this procedure.
Gibson Assembly of Cut pCDF-Duet-1 and Flippase. Gibson Assembly was used to insert the flippase gene into the first multiple cloning site of pCDF-Duet-1. Sam, Michael, and Marvel were involved in this procedure.
Transforming pCDF-Duet-1-FLPinto Electrocompetent Cells. We used electrocompetent DH5α E. coli cells to amplify and plasmid extract the newly synthesized pCDF-Duet-1-FLP plasmid. Sam, Michael, and Marvel were involved in this procedure.
Cotransfection of pCDF-Duet-1-FLP and PKD4 Plasmids in E. coli cells. We used electrocompetent BL21DE3 E. coli cells to co-transfect the plasmids pCDF-Duet-1-FLP and PKD4. The BL21DE3 strain of E. coli was used since it possesses an inducible T7 polymerase. The colonies selected for positive double transformation were then used in the IPTG-mediated flippase induction assay. Sam, Michael, and Marvel were involved in this procedure.
IPTG-mediated Flippase Induction Assay. IPTG was used to induce the expression of flippase to assess the activity of the flippase enzyme. Sam, Michael, and Marvel were involved in this procedure.
Amplification of FLPA, FLPB, pMag, and nMag via PCR. Using the primers created previously, we used PCR to amplify these four fragments will be used in the cloning of Opto-FLP. Sam, Michael, and Marvel were involved in this procedure.
