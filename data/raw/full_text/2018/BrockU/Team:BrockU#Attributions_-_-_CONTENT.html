Robert, Raymond, Jenna, Sam, Michael, and Marvel were involved in this procedure. 
<B>Primer Design.</B> We used the ApE software as well as the NEB Tm Calculator to design primers for the amplification of the native Flippase gene; as well as the FLPA, FLPB, pMag, and nMag fragments. Robert, Raymond, Jenna, Sam, Michael, and Marvel were involved in this procedure.
<B>Restriction Enzyme Digest of pCDF-Duet-1.</B> pCDF-Duet-1 was cut using the two restriction enzymes, NcoI and NotI. This enabled for subsequent Gibson Assembly. Sam, Michael, Matteo, and Marvel were involved in this procedure.
<B>Amplification of the Flippase Gene.</B> Using the primers created previously, we used PCR to amplify the flippase gene. The flippase fragment will be inserted into pCDF-Duet-1. Sam, Michael, and Marvel were involved in this procedure.
<B>Gibson Assembly of Cut pCDF-Duet-1 and Flippase.</B> Gibson Assembly was used to insert the flippase gene into the first multiple cloning site of pCDF-Duet-1. Sam, Michael, and Marvel were involved in this procedure. 
<B>Transforming pCDF-Duet-1-FLPinto Electrocompetent Cells.</B> We used electrocompetent DH5α <I>E. coli</I> cells to amplify and plasmid extract the newly synthesized pCDF-Duet-1-FLP plasmid. Sam, Michael, and Marvel were involved in this procedure. 
<B>Cotransfection of pCDF-Duet-1-FLP and PKD4 Plasmids in <I>E. coli</I> cells.</B> We used electrocompetent BL21DE3 <I>E. coli</I> cells to co-transfect the plasmids pCDF-Duet-1-FLP and PKD4. The BL21DE3 strain of <I>E. coli</I> was used since it possesses an inducible T7 polymerase. The colonies selected for positive double transformation were then used in the IPTG-mediated flippase induction assay. Sam, Michael, and Marvel were involved in this procedure. 
<B>IPTG-mediated Flippase Induction Assay.</B> IPTG was used to induce the expression of flippase to assess the activity of the flippase enzyme. Sam, Michael, and Marvel were involved in this procedure.
<B>Amplification of FLPA, FLPB, pMag, and nMag via PCR.</B> Using the primers created previously, we used PCR to amplify these four fragments will be used in the cloning of Opto-FLP. Sam, Michael, and Marvel were involved in this procedure.
