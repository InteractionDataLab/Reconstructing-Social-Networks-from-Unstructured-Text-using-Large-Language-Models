Parts
This year, Team ICT-Mumbai contributed four composite parts towards the iGEM Parts Registry. Our best composite part is described below:
Best Composite Part
BBa_K2802001:
This part is a composite part composed of BBa_K274380, BBa_I746351 and BBa_K518012. A promoter can be cloned upstream of this part, and the PSP3 pag phage activator that will be produced will bind to the PF phage promoter to drive expression of the PSP3 pag phage activator, forming a genetic amplification circuit. RFP, which will be produced from the gene cloned downstream of the second pag gene, will act as a detectable output of this genetic amplification circuit.
Design
BBa_K2802000 and BBa_K518012 were joined together using 3A Assembly.
The 718 bp BBa_K2802000 (lane 2) and 828 bp BBa_K518012 parts were joined together to make 1554 bp BBa_K2802001 (lane 3). The plasmid backbone is pSB1C3. Plasmids were digested with EcoRI and PstI to release the parts and determine correct assembly of the parts.
Other Composite Parts
BBa_K2802000:
This part is a composite part composed of BBa_K274380 and BBa_I746351. A promoter can be cloned upstream of this part, and the PSP3 pag phage activator that will be produced will bind to the PF phage promoter to drive expression of the PSP3 pag phage activator, forming a genetic amplification circuit.
BBa_K2802002:
This part is a composite part composed of BBa_K274371 and BBa_I746350. A promoter can be cloned upstream of this part, and the P2 ogr phage activator that will be produced will bind to the PO phage promoter to drive expression of the P2 ogr phage activator, forming a genetic amplification circuit.
BBa_K2802003:
This part is a composite part composed of BBa_K274371, BBa_I746350 and BBa_K518012. A promoter can be cloned upstream of this part, and the P2 ogr phage activator that will be produced will bind to the PO phage promoter to drive expression of the P2 ogr phage activator, forming a genetic amplification circuit. RFP, which will be produced from the gene cloned downstream of the second ogr gene, will act as a detectable output of this genetic amplification circuit.
