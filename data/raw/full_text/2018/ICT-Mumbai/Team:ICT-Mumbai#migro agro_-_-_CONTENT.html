Migrow Agro Products, an ISO 9001:2008 certified biotechnological company aimed to benefit agricultural sector with Biofertilizer, Organic Fertilizers, Organic Pesticides and Organic Fungicides.

People Interviewed: 
Mr. Panikar and Mr. Topre (Founders)
</P><H4>Major Things to look out for:</H4><H5>Introduction</H5><P class="para">We spoke to the founders of Migrow Agro Products for a better understanding on the use of biofertilizers. Bio-fertilizers generally make use of live cultures of common soil bacteria which possess Nitrogen fixing and Phosphorous solubilizing capabilities among others. Generally the bacteria used for Phosphorous solubilization (called PSBs) are Pseudomonas spp., Pseudomonas str., Pseudomonas flourescens, Bacillus megaterium etc. The Nitrogen fixing bacteria include Rhizobium and Azetobactor. It is a well estabilished industry with rules well defined by “The Fertilizer Control Order” or FCO.
Due to their difficult manufacturing process, bio-fertilizers tend to be more expensive than chemical fertilizers. This inadvertently makes the farmer prefer chemical fertilizers as they get better yield and thus more money. What they do not know, however is that there is a great demand for “Organic” produce in our country and more so abroad. Thus the greater investment and comparatively lower yield is compensated by the value of their produce. Hence the farmers do really benefit from adopting organic methods but choose not to do so because of less efficiency of bio-fertilizers. Further the government does not give any substantial support to further the production of organic fertilizers.</P><H5>Formulations and frequency of replenishment</H5><P class="para">The bio-fertilizer formulations sold in market generally consist of a live culture/s and nutrients for it. When asked about the need for replenishing such fertilizers, Mr. Panikar drew attention to the fact that even while growing cultures in the lab, a culture has to be subcultured in a cycle of 3 months. This is mainly to replenish the nutrients available for the bacteria. Hence this same principle is the reason that even bio-fertilizers need to be constantly replenished in the soil. The amount of fertilizer  and replenishment frequency depend on the type of soil. It has been observed that soils having high chemical content (e.g. pesticides) require more amount of bio-fertilizer to observe the same effect. 
            </P><H5>Usage and method of application</H5><P class="para">
This poses a problem regarding the economic feasibility of our bacteria - which may need to be replenished in the soil.
The process of usage of bio-fertilizers vary in different stages of the crop’s life. The soil can be prepped with fertilizer prior to sowing. Seeds are soaked in fertilizer solutions prior to sowing. After 8-10 days of sowing, the fertilizer is supplied via irrigation channels or drip irrigation systems.
To promote the usage of bio-fertilizers, Mr. Panikar and his team use a strategy that slowly introduces farmers to the benefits of bio-fertilizers. They convince the farmers to gradually increase the proportion of biofertilizers in their soil and observe the effects. In the end, most farmers do recognize the benefits of the bio-fertilizer and adopt this method.
</P><H5>Insights</H5><P class="para">This discussion with Mr. Panikar and Mr. Topre was insightful in that we really need to consider the economic implications of our project. The demand for bio-fertilizers is much less than that of chemical fertilizers, and farmers would not prefer to use highly expensive products as a substitute for cheap ones no matter the damage to the environment or to themselves.
