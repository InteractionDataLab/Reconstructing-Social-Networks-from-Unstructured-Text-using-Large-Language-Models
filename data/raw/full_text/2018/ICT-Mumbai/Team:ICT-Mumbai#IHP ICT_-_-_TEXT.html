This is Ninad. He is in the third year of his Chemical Engineering degree. He is enamoured by technology, especially smartphones and computers.  He loves reading about world politics and tries finding humour in all places. Synthetic biology, according to him, is an amalgam of biology, engineering, mathematics and computing. Just by considering the four bases, A T G C, you can twist and turn and mold them to make something new. Something challenging. Revolutionary.
This is Bhargav. Heâ€™s in the Third year of chemical engineering at ICT.  When heâ€™s not iGEMing, he loves to watch movies, exercise (or he likes to think so) and read. He thinks Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is a definite conversation starter and can go on about it. ðŸ˜ƒ  Heâ€™s an all-rounder and has managed several important posts in the past including that of Tedx ICT curator. Heâ€™s excited about iGEM and thinks itâ€™d be fun to learn about genetic engineering and synbio.
This is Atharva. He is currently in his Third Year of Chemical Engineering. He loves playing badminton and cricket. He likes to read in his free time. He was always fascinated by the efficiency and accuracy of biological systems and wanted to contribute to this field. Synthetic biology allows us to bind all the branches of science together and program biological systems according to our wishes which fueled his interest for iGem.
This is Supriya.She's pursuing her bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering. Off the record, she is always excited to learn something new and loves singing.There are times she switches from Dryden to Agatha Christie.To create something exciting from basic, natural, existing systems is what gets her worked up!
