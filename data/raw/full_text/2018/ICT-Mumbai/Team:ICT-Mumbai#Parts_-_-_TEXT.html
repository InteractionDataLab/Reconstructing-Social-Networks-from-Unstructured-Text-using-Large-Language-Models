Parts
The aim of our project is to isolate the promoters of the genes that are upregulated in presence of root exudates of the crops and use these promoters in different applications. As a case study, we worked on construction of a positive feedback circuit to amplify the production of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase in response to root exudates, during which we prepared several composite parts and intermediates and submitted them to the Registry.
Description
BBa_K2802000:
This part is a composite part composed of BBa_K274380 and BBa_I746351. A promoter can be cloned upstream of this part, and the PSP3 pag phage activator that will be produced will bind to the PF phage promoter to drive expression of the PSP3 pag phage activator, forming a genetic amplification circuit.
BBa_K2802001:
This part is a composite part composed of BBa_K274380, BBa_I746351 and BBa_K518012. A promoter can be cloned upstream of this part, and the PSP3 pag phage activator that will be produced will bind to the PF phage promoter to drive expression of the PSP3 pag phage activator, forming a genetic amplification circuit. RFP, which will be produced from the gene cloned downstream of the second pag gene, will act as a detectable output of this genetic amplification circuit.
BBa_K2802002:
This part is a composite part composed of BBa_K274371 and BBa_I746350. A promoter can be cloned upstream of this part, and the P2 ogr phage activator that will be produced will bind to the PO phage promoter to drive expression of the P2 ogr phage activator, forming a genetic amplification circuit.
BBa_K2802003:
This part is a composite part composed of BBa_K274371, BBa_I746350 and BBa_K518012. A promoter can be cloned upstream of this part, and the P2 ogr phage activator that will be produced will bind to the PO phage promoter to drive expression of the P2 ogr phage activator, forming a genetic amplification circuit. RFP, which will be produced from the gene cloned downstream of the second ogr gene, will act as a detectable output of this genetic amplification circuit.
