Illegal sites
According to the BioBrick RFC[10] standards, each BioBrick part must have a Prefix and Suffix.[1] In order for a part to be compatible with BioBrick RFC[10] standards, it must not certain restriction sites, as these are unique to the prefix and suffix. (see adjacent table)
If the sequence to be contains any of these sites, the program detects them. Furthermore the software  also suggests replacement for the illegal sequences, which do not change the overall amino acid translation. The most exciting feature of this application is that it takes into account the codon preferences for your chassis organisms. The frequency and efficiency of usage of codons in different organisms are different for producing the same amino acid. BBrickIt takes that into account and then suggests a new sequence that is optimized for the chassis organism.
BioBrick your part and more!
Add required Prefix and suffix.
Check for illegal sequences in the coding sequence.
Suggest replacement for these sites based on the origin organism!
