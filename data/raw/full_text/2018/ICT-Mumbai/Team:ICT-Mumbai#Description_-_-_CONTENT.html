</P></DIV><DIV class="wrapper"><H1>Our Project</H1><H4>Introduction</H4><P>The chemicals secreted into the soil by roots of plants are broadly referred to as root exudates.
Through the exudation of a wide variety of compounds, the roots may regulate the soil microbial
community in their immediate vicinity, cope with herbivores, encourage beneficial symbioses,
change the chemical and physical properties of the soil, and inhibit the growth of competing
plant species. A large amount of literature  suggests that root exudates may act as messengers
that communicate and initiate biological and physical interactions between roots and soil
organisms.<SUP>[1-5]</SUP>
Our project aims to “programme” microbes to detect specific crops by sensing their root
exudates. Each plant species has a different set of root exudates <SUP>[6-13]</SUP>, and the aim is to
engineer a chassis bacterium, <I>Bacillus subtilis</I>, to respond differently to different exudates and
hence sense the plant that is currently being grown in the soil.
There are numerous possible applications of this concept, including plant specific nutrition, stimulating
disease resistance, and targeted toxicity. An application that we decided to work on is solubilization of phosphorous present in soil for easy uptake by plants.​</P></DIV><DIV><DIV id="wrapper-left"><H4>Plan of Action</H4><P>The goal is to study the unique response of <I>B. subtilis</I> to different plants' root exudates. For this, four crops that are widely cultivated in India, namely rice, wheat, soybean and tomato, were used as experimental specimens. Seeds were germinated in sterile soil, and saplings were grown under sterile conditions and their root exudates were
collected. <I>B. subtilis</I> was grown in presence of these exudates, and RNA was extracted from the bacterial cells. RNA sequencing is being carried out to identify genes that are highly expressed in the presence of the exudates. Promoters of such highly expressed genes will be used to construct a genetic switch that responds to plant exudates of specific crops.
</P></DIV><DIV class="wrapper"><H3>Application in Phosphorous Solubilization</H3><H4>Phosphorous in soil</H4><P>
Phosphorus (P) deficiency in soil is a major constraint for agricultural production worldwide.
Many soils throughout the world are P-deficient because the free phosphorus concentration (the
available form to plants) even in fertile soils is generally not higher than 10 mM, even at pH 6.5
when it is most soluble. Low levels of P are due to the high reactivity of soluble P with calcium
(Ca), iron (Fe) or aluminum (Al), which leads to P precipitation. Inorganic P in acidic soils is
associated with Al and Fe compounds, whereas calcium phosphates are the predominant form
in calcareous soils.
Despite this, most soils contain significant amounts of total soil P that occurs in inorganic and
organic fractions and accumulates with phosphorus fertilization. Organic phosphorus inputs to
soil from plants and microbes are mainly phosphodiesters, which must be hydrolysed by
phosphodiesterase and phosphomonoesterase prior to the release of free phosphate for
biological uptake.<SUP>[14-15]</SUP>
The ability of soil microorganisms to solubilize various forms of insoluble P fractions is well
documented. <I>Bacillus</I> spp. and <I>Rhizobium</I> spp. are the most powerful phosphate solubilizers among
bacteria.<SUP>[16-19]</SUP></P><H4>Role of Engineered <I>B. subtilis</I></H4><P>
The engineered <I>B. subtilis</I> will perform two functions:</P><OL><LI>Detecting the plant 
</LI><LI>Amplifying its own phosphodiesterase production
</LI></OL><P>

Upon detecting the plant, the engineered bacteria will
secrete enzymes that convert the phosphorus in the soil into a form that is more easily
assimilated by the plants. The production of the enzyme will be amplified by incorporating a
gene amplification circuit <SUP>[20]</SUP> within the chassis bacteria. Since the circuit will be triggered only in
the presence of specific exudates, depending upon the plant of interest, weeds will effectively be
prevented from using up most of the phosphate in the soil.
</P><H3>Potential application: Systemic acquired resistance (SAR)</H3><H4>What is SAR?</H4><P>
Systemic acquired resistance is an induced defense mechanism in plants that inherently
protects the plant against a variety of diseases.<SUP>[21-24]</SUP> It is analogous to the immune system in animals,
as it primes the plant to defend itself against pest attacks and diseases following
earlier localized exposure to the pathogen. The limitation of this system is that it is activated
only after exposure to the pathogen, i.e., after the pest has attacked the plant once. Further,
the effect of SAR is not perpetual and wears off with time.
</P><H4>Synthetic activation of SAR</H4><P>
A number of commercially available chemical activators induce SAR in plants,
the most popular of which is salicylic acid (SA).<SUP>[25]</SUP> However, a number of problems are reported
with the continuous and prolonged usage of such activators, such as low yields and reduced seed
sizes. This is mainly due to the large energy deficit caused to plants when they are under
constant influence of the activator.
</P><H4>A Solution</H4><P>
A way around this problem is to design a dosage system in such a way that the plant is
periodically exposed to the activator such that it has intermediate periods in which it is free of
the activators’ influence. For this purpose, an oscillatory circuit <SUP>[26]</SUP> can be incorporated within the
chassis organism, <I>B. subtilis</I>, such that it releases salicylic acid (which can be synthesized from
a metabolic intermediate), in optimized doses.
</P><H3>How will this project benefit Society?</H3><P>
As a part of <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:ICT-Mumbai/Human_Practices"><U> Integrated Human Practices</U></A>, the team spoke to multiple experts in the field of
agriculture, fertilizers and bio-fertilizers, including farmers and innovators. From the surveys and farm
visits, a lot of information was gained which indicated the need for the solutions that this project
promises.

The efficiency of phosphate solubilization can be increased with the use of the engineered
bacteria, which may improve the popularity of bio-fertilizers among farmers, who currently prefer
chemical fertilizers. Thus the larger effect would be to reduce the usage of chemical fertilizers in
Indian agriculture. The project also has potential to reduce the usage of weedicides.

Pesticides are currently being used as a curative measure for plants affected by pathogens and
pests. However, pesticides have a large number of well-known ill-effects such as persistence in
groundwater, neurological disorders, cancer, respiratory illnesses in farmers, and contamination
of fruits and vegetables.

Moreover, the use of pesticides is not a preventative measure. If SAR can be continuously
primed in the plants, it would eliminate the need for pesticides and ensure that the disease does
not affect the plant in the first place.
