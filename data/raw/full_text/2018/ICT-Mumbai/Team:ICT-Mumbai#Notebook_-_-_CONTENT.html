</DIV></DIV><DIV id="Week 1" class="tabcontent"><DIV class="paper">

Plans to make an amplification circuit was made that would look like:
Pin (inducible by plant exudates) – RBS – Ta(transcriptional activator) -  Pta(induced by transcriptional activator) – RBS  – Ta(transcriptional activator) – RBS – GENE – TER. 
Plans were made to produce Phytases and salicylic acid from B.subtilis.
Materials required to start the project were collected, primers were ordered every requirement was met in this week.

Extraction of exudates from the soil of the crops grown (see exudate extraction protocol <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:ICT-Mumbai/Experiments"><U>here</U></A>)

The following parts from iGEM 2018 distribution kits were reconstituted and transformed into E. coli strain DH5α:

•	Jo4450

•	K274380  (construct with transcriptional activators1)

•	K274371  (construct with transcriptional activators2)

•	K823001  (promoter induced by Bacitracin )

Plasmid backbone PSB1C3 was obtained from J04450

K274380 and K274371 have the following structure: 

 RBS – TA – Ter – Pta (TA – Transcriptional Activator, Pta – promoter activated by transcriptional activator, Ter - terminator)
Out of this 
RBS – Ta were PCR amplified and joined at the ends of these parts using 3A assembly to give a construct like:
RBS – Ta – Ter – Pta – RBS – Ta.

From this construct, the RBS – TA section was PCR amplified using appropriate primers, and ligated to these parts using the 3A assembly (protocol used given <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:ICT-Mumbai/Experiments"><U>here</U></A>). The above parts were digested using EcoRI and SpeI, while the RBS – TA parts were digested using XbaI and PstI to give a construct like:
 RBS – Ta – Ter – Pta – RBS – Ta.
</DIV></DIV><DIV id="Week 3" class="tabcontent"><DIV class="paper">

Sizes of the parts were checked by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. (protocol available <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:ICT-Mumbai/Experiments"><U>here</U></A>). Correct sizes of the bands were observed and the parts were gel purified. (protocol available <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:ICT-Mumbai/Experiments"><U>here</U></A>). Below is a picture of the gel taken on a BioRad Molecular Imager® VersaDoc™ MP 4000 system.  
 
Glycerol stocks of E coli DH5α strains containing the plasmids with these parts were made and kept at -80℃ for long term storage.
•	The part with K274380 was named 80P (Pag is the transcriptional activator)
•	Part with k274371 was named 71O (Ogr is the transcriptional activator)
•	Along with this k518012 (RBS – RFP - Ter) was pulled out of iGem distribution kit 2018.
•	The gene <I>PhoD</I> was PCR amplified from the genome of B.subtilis 168 with an annealing temperature of 60 deg Celsius .


</DIV></DIV><DIV id="Week 4" class="tabcontent"><DIV class="paper">•	The K518012 part was assembled downstream of 80P and 71O separately using the 3A assembly. 80P and 71O were digested using EcoRI and SpeI, while the K518012  was digested using XbaI and PstI, followed by gel purification and ligation of the fragments.
•	phoD was assembled downstream 80P and 71O separately using 3A assembly. 80P and 71O were digested using EcoRI and SpeI, while the phoD  was digested using XbaI and PstI, followed by gel purification and ligation of the fragments.

</DIV></DIV><DIV id="Week 5" class="tabcontent"><DIV class="paper">•	These new parts were analyzed for correct sizes. Since the size of the new part and the plasmid backbone were identical we had to run longer gels in order to observe correct sizes
</DIV></DIV><DIV id="Week 6" class="tabcontent"><DIV class="paper">
•	The B. subtilis promoter, K823001 (induced by Bacitracin) was assembled upstream of the amplification circuit. This was done by digesting the parts containing plasmids with EcoRI and XbaI, while the promoter was digested using EcoRI and SpeI. This unusual protocol was followed in order to increase the probability of correct ligation. Since, as per our calculations, due to similar sizes (difference of only 100bp) of the plasmid backbone and the parts, a 3A assembly would have led to a lot of undesirable ligations.
•	Promoter was also assembled upstream K518012 and phoD to make constructs having the structure:
Pin – RBS – RFP – Ter and Pin – RBS – PhoD - Ter. 
This construct is to be used as a control to measure the amount of amplification by the amplification circuit.
•	After all of this work we finally had the following constructs
i.	Pin – RBS – Pag –Ter -  Ppag – RBS – Pag – RBS – RFP – Ter.
ii.	Pin – RBS – Pag –Ter -  Ppag – RBS – Pag – RBS – PhoD – Ter.
iii.	Pin – PBS – Ogr – Ter – Pogr – RBS – Ogr – RBS – RFP – Ter.
iv.	Pin – PBS – Ogr – Ter – Pogr – RBS – Ogr – RBS – PhoD – Ter.
v.	Pin – RBS – RFP – Ter.
vi.	Pin – RBS – PhoD – Ter.
