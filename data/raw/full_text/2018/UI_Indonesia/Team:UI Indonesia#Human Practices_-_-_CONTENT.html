The government of Indonesia has recorded 593 diphtheria cases, spread across 95 regencies in 20 provinces. With total number of victims has reached 32 people only for around 2 months. The World Health Organization data on diphtheria shows that the number of cases in Indonesia has fluctuated since the 1980s, even though some prevention already executed. In 2014, 7,321 cases of diphtheria were reported to the World Health Organization, but there are likely many more cases, make the disease continues to cause illness globally. 
As UI IGEM team works are dynamic in term of activity and diverse in term of targeted participants, we design our programs not only to fulfill the goals of integrated human practice, we also tried to achieve but also to integrate each program into our project. We realize the urgency of fast, reliable, and cheap early detection method for diphtheria infection to overcome this issue. However, in order to develop device which have the criteria above, we have  to spent most of our time project by interviews with the expert in the field with multidimensional approach (safety, religions, policy aspects), creating events with diverse segment participants in order to get their feedback toward the project, and finally, implementation. We got safety training and certification before entering the lab, working lab project whole summer, and finally we created our product, <B>Diagnostic Track: Utilization of LuxAB-eYFP Resonance Energy Transfer System to Detect Diphtheria Toxin.</B></H5></DIV><DIV class="bgimg-10 w3-display-container w3-opacity-min" id="Ethical Review"><DIV class="w3-display-middle" style="white-space:nowrap;"><SPAN class="w3-center w3-padding-large w3-black w3-xlarge w3-wide w3-animate-opacity">ETHICAL REVIEW</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64"><H2 align="center"><B>Process 2: Ethical Review</B></H2><H5>Our project, Finding Diphthy, is expected to be implemented among the society in the future. But in the other hand, there is a potential controversy within this project by using HB-EGF genes (which comes from human genes) as one of the materials. Thus, we need to ensure the society reaction and acceptance due to its ethical aspect including the legal and religion view. This ethical review is also being held <B>to direct our project according to the society’s view</B> so that our project can optimally affect the society.</H5><H3><B><I>2.1. Legal Perspective of Finding Diphthy Project</I></B></H3><H5>The legal perspective of our project is being discussed with Mr. Wahyu Andrianto, S.H., M. H., one of lecturers in Faculty of Law, Universitas Indonesia, who is an expert in Health Law aspect. The discussion was held in 26th July 2018 in the Faculty of Law, Universitas Indonesia. Here, we are discussing about genetic engineering in general and our project through the national law perspective.
  
  According to Mr. Adrianto, in general, genetic engineering technology has not been strongly regulated by the Indonesian law. Mostly, the law only regulating about genetic engineering in food product, therapeutic, and a few of stem cell development, while our project tends to be included as medical research. Despite of that, inform consent of its project has to be held and has to be operated by health professionals according to Regulation of Ministry of Health No. 585 Year 1989 renewed in Regulation of Ministry of Health No. 290 Year 2008 and also supported by the special rules (lex specialis) in Constitution of Health No. 36 Year 2009.</H5><DIV align="center"><H6><I>Discussion session with Expert Policy in Indonesia, Mr. Wahyu Andrianto, S.H., M.

In addition, the fact that the gene supplier has its own legal perspective in which country it is located (which is different to Indonesia) is need to be concerned. But, for Indonesia itself, as long as the supplier has a legal permission from Indonesia Ministry of Health, it can be stated as <B>legal and acceptable</B>.
  In addition, concerning about its implementation, it is still possible to apply the operator independency of Finding Diphthy tool that makes the society able to use it by themselves as long as we have a clear boundaries and procedure, safety instruction, and accounted validity.</H5><H5><B>Overall, the implementation of Finding Diphthy project is considered legal and acceptable for the law aspect.</B> The implementation is allowed with some terms applied, which are: not against the ethic and norms, the used medium is qualified, all parties working hand in hand with law corridor, and is not for commercial matters.</H5><H3><B><I>2.2. Religion Perspective of Finding Diphthy Project</I></B></H3><H5>Biotechnology as an applied biological science has proven to have helped overcome many problems in human life such as food, agriculture, health and industry, as well as remediation of environmental damage. However, it should also be recognized that the use of biotechnology by humanity can have an unexpected impact. Concerns about the negative impact of using genetically engineered products on social and religious impacts, occur in the application of biotechnology such as cloned misuse.</H5><H5>The most prominent scientist of this century Albert Einstein states &quot;Religion without science is blind. Science without religion is paralyzed.&quot; Einstein's statement is advice to scientists, and for all of us, that the development of science needs to pay attention to religious values. Indonesia is an archipelago country full of wealth and diversity of natural resources, culture, race, regional languages, and religion. In Indonesia there are several religions such as Islam, Christianity, Catholicism, Hinduism and Buddhism. We conducted a study on the views of religious leaders on our project so that our project does not cross social and religious boundaries and is expected to be accepted by the community, especially the Indonesian people.</H5><DIV class="center"><H6><I>Religion View Discussion session with Christian Spiritual Leader, Ps. Raditya Oloan</I></H6></DIV><H5>We have conducted interviews with leaders of Islam, Christianity, Catholicism, Hinduism and Buddhism. <B>From the results of the interview, it can be concluded that genetic engineering and especially Finding Diphthy project is allowed as long as it does not endanger the existence of a living creature and has benefits for many people. </B> These are the two conditions needs to be fulfilled in order to be accepted from religion’s perspective. For this project, it is necessary to use human genes because diphtheria bacteria attack human body cells and then put them into bacteria so that they can be reproduced, this project is acceptable as long as it can fulfill both conditions. Moreover, the human gene that we used is not obtained by taking itself from humans, but through the services of suppliers by creating synthetic genes. Information regarding the supplier’s raw material is still classified, but it is ensured the method does not harm any living being.</H5><DIV align="center"><H6><I>Religion View Discussion session with Buddhism Spiritual Leader, Ir.

Through human practice, UI IGEM Team is considering how we can educate, reach, and engage the society not for them to know about our project but more than that, to make the society knows that they have a new hope to conquer this diphtheria problem (<I>Point 2</I>).</H5><H5>We have reached from grass-root to top level of the society. Through some studies and discussions such as: biosafety study, ethic study, and health expert study, we reached the expert and the society top level perspective and attention about this issue. We also reached the public opinion and raising their awareness by some projects like A Day with Diphteria, Community Visit, and also Public Discussion Forum (in collaboration with NTU Singapore IGEM Team). Even, we reached the grass-root level by holding a social work for people of Cikidang Village that located in the top of a mountain. Here in the social work, we are not only educate the society and raise their awareness but we also asking their opinion and point of view about diphtheria and our project . In this event we also involve more people by training them to educate the villagers about health.
