Built, characterized, and documented new and existing biobrick part
SILVER MEDAL
We experimentally validate more than one new BioBrick Part or Device of our own design and construction works as expected.
We submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines)
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system
Our projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights
GOLD MEDAL
We detailed an issued and changes our project according to it (based on law and spiritual issues)
