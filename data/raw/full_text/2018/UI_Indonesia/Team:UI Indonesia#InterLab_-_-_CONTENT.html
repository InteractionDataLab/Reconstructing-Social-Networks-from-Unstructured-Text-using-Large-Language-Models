For past several years, iGEM Measurement Committee has been working on this issue by encouraging registered iGEM 2018 teams to participate in annual InterLab study. 
          InterLab study is mainly focused on fluorescence measurements as one of widely utilized protocols in synthetic biology studies.
          
          Therefore, in this year’s InterLab study, participating 2018 iGEM teams are encouraged to help iGEM Measurement Committee in investigating whether more direct method in expressing total cell number for fluorescence calculation, such as absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs), are better than OD to reduce variability in bulk measurement. We proudly announce our participation in 5<SUP>th</SUP> InterLab study for the first time ever, in the hope that our results may contribute to the improvements in synthetic biology.

We wore personal protective equipment (PPE) such as laboratory safety gowns with head cover, masks, and gloves (<B>Figure 3, left</B>). For procedures that require aseptic technique such as bacterial inoculation, we conducted the experiments in biosafety cabinet (BSC) to prevent contamination (<B>Figure 3, right</B>).

After overnight incubation at 37<SUP>o</SUP>C, two colonies from each transformation plates were inoculated in 10 mL LB liquid medium + Cam and let to be grown overnight at 37<SUP>o</SUP>C and 220 rotations per minute (rpm). On the next day, we diluted 0.5 mL of each culture in 4.5 mL LB + Cam (ratio 1:10) and measured for their respective Abs<SUB>600</SUB>, along with Abs<SUB>600</SUB> of LB + Cam (we created two replicates to be measured for each sample). Using obtained Abs<SUB>600</SUB> data, the cultures were further diluted to target Abs<SUB>600</SUB> 0.02 in final volume of 12 mL LB + Cam in different 50 mL centrifuge tubes covered with foil. From each centrifuge tube, 500 uL diluted cultures were sampled and measured for Abs<SUB>600</SUB> and fluorescence, while the rest of diluted cultures were incubated at 37<SUP>o</SUP>C, 220 rpm until next six hours to be sampled and measured again. Samples for Abs<SUB>600</SUB> and fluorescence measurements were put in 96-well plates (each well contains 100 uL volume) according to layout shown in <B>Figure 8</B>, under same conditions as previous calibration in Part I of the protocol.</H5><DIV class="w3-row w3-center"><H6><B>Figure 8.</B> Layout for Abs<SUB>600</SUB> and fluorescence measurement.

The significance of this part is that CFU counts are directly correlated with cell concentration in given volume of culture (i.e. viable cell counts per mL). In this part, we used two colonies from each positive and negative control (four in total). This part consists of three steps as follows:</H5><DIV class="w3-row w3-center"><H6><B>Figure 9.</B> Layout of 96-well plate used for starting sample preparation.

First, we sampled 25 uL of each positive and negative overnight cultures and diluted them with 175 uL fresh LB + Cam (eight-fold dilution). We then measured their respective Abs<SUB>600</SUB> along with blank LB + Cam according to layout shown in <B>Figure 9, red inset</B>. Using this data, their OD<SUB>600</SUB> were calculated by multiplying each of them with conversion factor (obtained from Part I). The overnight cultures were further diluted to target OD<SUB>600</SUB> 0.1 using previous calculated OD<SUB>600</SUB> data in final volume of 1 mL LB + Cam (these are “starting samples”). We then created triplicates of each starting sample (twelve in total) and checked for their OD<SUB>600</SUB> if they were 0.1, using measurement with same 96-well plate (<B>Figure 9, green inset</B>).</LI></UL></H5><DIV class="w3-row w3-center"><H6><B>Figure 10.</B> Suggested workflow for serial dilution of starting sample.

However, we realized the maximum capacity of our microtubes was 1.5 mL so we could not aliquot 1.9 mL LB + Cam in the tubes. Therefore, to compensate that issue, we first prepared 36 microtubes with 950 uL LB + Cam each, 24 microtubes with 900 uL LB + Cam each, and 36 LB agar + Cam. For first three dilutions, we halved the volume of LB + Cam in “Dilution 1” until “Dilution 3” tubes and the added volume of starting sample (50 uL into next 950 uL LB + Cam) so the net dilution factor would be the same (20-fold). Finally, we took 100 uL from each last three dilutions to be spread on different LB agar plate + Cam. The plates were then incubated overnight at 37<SUP>o</SUP>C and the colonies formed on each plate were counted after 18-20 hours of growth.</LI></UL></H5><H5><UL><LI><B>Step #3: Calculation of CFU/mL for OD<SUB>600<SUB> 0.1</SUB></SUB></B><SUB><SUB>.

When compared, both graphs look similar in pattern, however fluorescence of tested devices were differed from each other. Therefore, it can be implied that some promoters may have different activity in expressing its downstream genes (in this case, GFP). The data at t = 0 hour suggested that promoter J23101 (Test Device 1), J23100 (Test Device 4), and J23104 (Test Device 5) have higher activity in expressing GFP, resulting in higher fluorescence per OD and per particle compared to positive control. Furthermore, fluorescence observed in Test Device 2 and 6 were comparable with positive control, implying that promoter J23106 (Test Device 2) and J23116 (Test Device 6) have similar activity in expressing GFP with promoter J23151 (positive control). On the other hand, there was no fluorescence observed in Test Device 3 (similar with negative control that does not have GFP construct). It is likely that promoter J23117 (Test Device 3) failed to initiate GFP expression.</H5><H5>At t = 6 hour, declines in fluorescence per OD and per particle were observed in positive control, Test Device 2, Test Device 4, and Test Device 6, compared with t = 0 hour. A probable explanation for this phenomenon is that GFP expression mediated by promoters carried by these devices is limited by cell density (i.e. no additional GFP expression when cells in a sample has reached a certain density), or cells in the culture underwent cessation. Therefore, when total fluorescence was divided by the cell number in given sample, fluorescence per OD and per particle will be decreased. Exception for Test Device 1 and 5, increase in fluorescence per OD and per particle were observed, suggesting that promoter J23101 and J23104 may be strong promoters that actively express their downstream genes despite high density of cells.</H5><H5><B><I> Part III: Colony Forming Units (CFUs)</I></B></H5><DIV class="w3-row w3-center"><H6><B>Table 3</B>.

The analysis for t = 0 hour can be seen in <B>Table 6</B> (detail calculation can be found in our Excel file). We found that our calculated fluorescence per CFU were different with fluorescence per particle. Therefore, our results suggested that the benefit of using direct method in expressing total cell number such as colony forming units (CFUs) than OD in reporting fluorescence per cell remains doubtful. However, to validate our findings, additional data from another teams are necessary.</H5></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER class="w3-center w3-green w3-padding-64 w3-opacity w3-hover-opacity-off"><DIV class="w3-xlarge w3-section">Team UI Indonesia igemui2018@gmail.com
