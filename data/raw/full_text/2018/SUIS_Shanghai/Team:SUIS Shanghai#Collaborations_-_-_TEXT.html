Main collaborators -  East China University of Science & Technology
They provide general advice throughout the duration of the project including on CAS agar plate preparation. They also provided the use of a plate reader for us to complete the interlab study and -80 C freezer to store glycerol stock of our transformed BL21 cells for later gene expression experiments.
We sent our cell samples after IPTG induction to them and they performed a rust test indicating siderophore production and could also use our cells producing vibrioferrin for their own experiments.
After our successful CAS agar plate tests we provided some of our batch to iGEM ECUST for them to test their own project designs.
