Project Outsourcing
The following details parts of the project that teams members were not directly involved in.
1. Shanghai Sensichip Biotechnology Company for helping us detects vibrioferrin through Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) technique and for providing data and interpretation of results to the team on time for Wiki freeze. We do not have the capabilities in our own lab for this technique.
2. Genscript china for synthesizing or DNA onto both expression vector pET-30a(+) and iGEM shipping plasmid pSB1C3. Also for shipping our DNA submission to Boston. Also for synthesizing primers for PCR amplification.
3. The staff and students related to ECUST iGEM 2018 for allowing us the use of their plate reader to complete the interlab study for 2018.
4. Our teachers and instructors Mr. David Doyle and Mr. Edgar Falcis for conducting experiments relating to the gene expression in E.coli cells, as the source of our genes of interest were from a risk level 2 bacterium. Also Mr. Doyle for acid washing glassware prior to CAS assay preparation.
