1. Improve the stability of the shRNA
We will try to improve the stability of shRNA. An example wil be combining shRNA with nano particles.
2. Improve the RNAi efficiency
We will try to improve the RNAi efficiency. For example, we will try different target genes, different target sites, different composition of shRNAs and different concentration of shRNAs.
