Mission: Field investigation
Date: May 13, 2018
Location: Shenzhen University’s field station, Longhua district, Shenzhen
From internet research and personal knowledge, we knew that pest infections seriously affected the yield and quality of vegetables, so we wanted to do something to help with this problem. In order to know more about the situation of pest infection, we did a field investigation at Shenzhen University’s field station to find out whether there was a kind of pest most rampant.
With the help of some farmers, we finally could catch pests by ourselves: we grasped the plants leaves, opened the cotton cloth bags to cover the leaves, so pests on the leaves could be caught in one time, it did not take very long before each of us collected many insects. Surprisingly, we found out that most of the insects were from the same species (except two out of all), basing on their identical and distinctive feature----two yellow stripes on their back.
After completing the research, we found that striped flea beetles have the highest frequency of occurrence. We collected some of these beetles back for species identification.
