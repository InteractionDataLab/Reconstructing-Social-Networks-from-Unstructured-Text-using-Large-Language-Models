1. Improve the stability of the shRNA
We will try to improve the stability of shRNA. for example, combine shRNA with nano particle.
2. Improve the RNAi efficiency
We will try to improve the RNAi efficiency. For example, we will try different target genes, different target sites, different composition of shRNAs, different concentration of shRNA.
