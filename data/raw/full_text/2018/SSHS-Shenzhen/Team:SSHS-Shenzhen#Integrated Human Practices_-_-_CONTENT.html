Mission: Field investigation
Date: May 13, 2018
Location: Shenzhen University’s field station, Longhua district, Shenzhen
</H2><P id="para">
Pest infections seriously affect the yield and quality of vegetables, we wanted to do something to help with this problem. In order to know more about the situation of pest infection, we did a field investigation at Shenzhen University’s field station and found that a striped flea beetle is the most serious kinds of pests. We collected some of these beetles back for species identification.
