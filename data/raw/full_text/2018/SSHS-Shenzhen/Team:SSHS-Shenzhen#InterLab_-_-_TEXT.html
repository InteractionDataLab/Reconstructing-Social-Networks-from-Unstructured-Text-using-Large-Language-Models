Specific data from our experiment
Note: In the process of calibration, only four 96 well plates are not enough for us because we sometimes made mistakes, such us drip into the wrong well. As a result, whenever we failed to drip, we had to clean up our fruits and dry the plates to ensure they can be used again.
Also, we found that silica suspension was easy to form precipitate, which causes a series of failure of our experiment. Thus, we shock it all the time to make sure it won’t precipitate to hinder.
