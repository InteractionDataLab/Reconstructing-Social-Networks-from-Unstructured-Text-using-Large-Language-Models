Background
Pests have caused billions of dollars in agricultural losses. Phyllotreta striolata is one of the most serious pests of vegetable crops worldwide. At present, the major approach to control P. striolata is to use chemical pesticides, which have resulted in dietary pesticide pollution and environmental destruction, thus caused significant hazards to human health and the environment. The alternative commercial biotechnological approach to controlling insect pests relies mainly on the expression of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal proteins, but Phyllotreta striolata is resistant to biopesticide Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Therefore, there is a critical need to develop economically, and ecologically, methods to control this this highly destructive agricultural pest. In recent years, RNAi has been used to downregulate the expression of speciﬁc genes, RNAi based transgenic plants producing dsRNAs directed against insect genes in Lepidoptera and Coleoptera pest species have been reported. In our project, we use topically application of siRNA/shRNA to control P. striolata
