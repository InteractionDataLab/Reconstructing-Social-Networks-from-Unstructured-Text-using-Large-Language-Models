Shenzhen Senior High School, May 3, 2018
On May 3, 2018, members of the iGEM team (SSHS-Shenzhen) of Shenzhen Senior High School received their first basic knowledge training. The training inspired members to develop methods to improve crop yields by changing crop traits to prevent pests(like hybridization, genetically modified and so on).
The most attractive way by utilizing RNAi technology, that is, the non-transgenic approach to achieve the effect of biological control. People in today's society are reluctant to transgenic technology because the hybrid method has no immediate effect while pesticide abuse is causing great harm to the environment. Therefore, our team hopes to achieve effective pest control effect through utilizing RNAi technology.
So, what is the RNAi technology? Dicer enzymes in eukaryotic cells can cut double-stranded RNA into small double-stranded RNA, or siRNA. Then, these siRNA act like soldiers in cells, binding to enzymes in cells that cut RNA like scissors. Finally, the siRNA takes the "scissors" and finds the mRNA of a gene that is complementary to its sequence and snips it short so that the snipped genes cannot be expressed. In the case of pests, we can destroy them by destroying the crucial genetic sequences that they depend on to survive.
Having learnt the basics of RNAi technology, members gained confidence in waging the battle against pests.
