Mission: Field investigation
Date: May 13, 2018
Location: Shenzhen University’s field station, Longhua district, Shenzhen
Pest infections seriously affect the yield and quality of vegetables, we wanted to do something to help with this problem. In order to know more about the situation of pest infection, we did a field investigation at Shenzhen University’s field station and found that a striped flea beetle is the most serious kinds of pests. We collected some of these beetles back for species identification. (Learn more)
Mission: Expert consultation
Date: May 13, 2018
Location: Zoological Laboratory, Shenzhen University.
To identify this highly destructive species, we went to Shenzhen University for expert consultation. Under the supervision of Professor Wang, we observed the beetle under microscope, and identified its physical characteristics. we learned that this beetle belongs to Phyllotreta Striolata. After the analysis, the professor taught us how to make specimens. (Learn more)
Mission: Internship of leaning to detect vegetables’ pesticide residue at the Food Inspection Center of Shenzhen
Date: August 3, 2018
Location: Food Inspection Center of Shenzhen
We were astonished by the pesticide residue detection results, and wanted to confirm the pesticide residue situation using more accurate and reliable methods. We then went to the Food Inspection Center of Shenzhen for further experiments. With the help of the technicians, we did the experiments, and found out that the Pakchoi contains three types of pesticide residue which are fliorosilazole 0.057mg/kg, worm nitrile 0.124mg/kg and cypermethrin 0.188mg/kg.

Mission: Farmers interview
Date: August 8, 2018
Location: Shenzhen University’s field station, Longhua district, Shenzhen.
To find out what approaches the farmers are currently using to control Phyllotreta Striolata, we went to Shenzhen University’s field station again and were told that currently, traditional chemical pesticide is the only effective way to prevent infestation. We also gathered information about the existing brands of pesticides and their uses on the market. (Learn more)
Mission: Rapid Pesticide residue detection on vegetables from small farmer’s market
Date: August 14, 2018
Location: Research lab at Shenzhen University
We wanted to find out if extensive use of chemical pesticide would cause food safety problems, thus, we performed pesticide residue detection using quick pesticide detection method we learned from internet. Pesticide residues were detected from the vegetables we tested. (Learn more)
Mission: A survey about food safety
Date: July 22, 2018
Location: Online
We wondered: are the general public aware of the commonly existed food safety problem? Do they know how to deal with this problem? Therefore, we did an online survey and received 1414 answer sheets. After analysis, we found many people don’t treat pesticide residue before cooking, and some of them do not know how to remove pesticide residues from vegetables. (Learn more)
