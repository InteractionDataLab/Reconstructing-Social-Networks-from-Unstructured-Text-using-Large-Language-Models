Styrene Extraction from Liquid Culture Batch for Harvesting
Measure the OD of liquid culture and make sure it’s in stagnation phase
Bring the liquid culture into a French Press setup for homogenization and cell lysis
Bring the cell lysate into a separatory funnel
Extract the cell lysate 5 times with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) of equal volume and gather the EtOAc fractions
In case of excessive foam formation phase separation can be supported by cooling the separatory funnel and increasing the osmolarity of the aqueous phase through addition of NaCl
Discard the aqueous phase
Extract the collected organic phase twice with an equal volume of water
Transfer the organic phase to a round bottom flask (RBF)
Add 4-tert-Butylcatechol to the organic phase and to the gathering vessel of a rotary evaporator
Attach the RBF to the rotary evaporator and evaporate the ethyl acetate at a pressure of 153 mbar and bath temperature of 40 °C
The purified styrene has to be kept concealed, cool and away from sunlight to prevent runaway polymerisation or evaporation
GC-FID calibration for styrene detection
2-methylanisole stock solution was prepared by dissolving 30,54 mg of 2-methylanisole in 25 ml benzene
Styrene stock solution was prepared by dissolving 5,2075 mg of styrene in 5 ml of benzene
10 calibration points of 200 µl were prepared by pipetting 20 µl of 2-methylanisole stock and X * 10 µl of styrene stock with X going from 1 to 10 and the rest of the volume to 200 µl being filled with benzene
The most concentrated calibration point is injected into the system with a mass spectrometer attached (GC-MS) and the retention times of styrene and 2-methylanisole are recorded
The 10 calibration points are injected into the system with a Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID)
For each calibration point the Response Ratio is calculated by dividing the AUC of the styrene peak by the AUC of the 2-methylanisole peak
The measurements and calculations of step 5) and 6) are executed in triplo
The r² of the three calibration curves are calculated
In case one of the curves had an r² of < 0,99 the measurements were repeated
For calculating styrene concentration the average of 3 valid slope values and the average of the y-axis intercepts are combined into one equation
The final equation of the calibration curve for our system came out to be:
styrene (mmol) = 0,9879494 x RR - 0,0857551

Add 80 µl of 10 mM 2-methylanisole stock solution in benzene and 720 µl benzene
Vortex the cup for 10 minutes
Centrifuge at 13.000 rpm for 10 minutes
Transfer the supernatant into a Gas Chromatography vial
Seal the GC Vial and put it into the GC sampler, 10 µl will be
Run the GC at 100 °C,
Measure the AUC of styrene at t=3,741 min and the AUC of 2-methylanisole at t=4,381 min
Calculate the Response Ratio by dividing the AUC of styrene by the AUC of 2-methylanisole

Calculate the resolution of the peaks by dividing the difference in retention times of the peaks by the average of the two peak widths at their base
Cellulase activity assay
This assay has the purpose to measure activity of cellulases on cellulose. In case cellulases are active, they will have produced hydrolytic ends on the degraded cellulose strands. The assay is based on this feature in a two-step oxidative pathway towards a chromogenic output. First, a mutated chito-oligosaccharide oxidase (ChitO-Q268R) releases hydrogen peroxide upon oxidation of the cellulase-produced hydrolytic products. Second, the hydrogen peroxide produced can be monitored by the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a chromogenic peroxidase substrate (DCHBS and AAP). As a result, the intensity of the pink color is proportional to the concentration of the available oxidase substrates and hence the amount of cellulose degradation.
Incubation buffer: 50 mM KPi pH 4.5
Assay buffer: 50 mM KPi pH 6.0
DCHBS: 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid
AAP: 4-aminoantipyrine
The cellulose and cellulases were incubated in incubation buffer at 40℃, 600 rpm in 2 ml eppendorf tubes in a heat block
The incubation mix of cellulose and cellulases is centrifuged for 1 min at 14000 rpm
50 µl of the supernatant is transferred into a 96 well plate
20 µl of 10 mM DCHBS is added
20 µl of 1 mM AAP is added
4 µl of HRP (200 U/mL) is added
6 µl assay buffer is added
Finally, to start the reaction, 6 µl ChitO (20 U/mL) is added, right before starting the absorbance measurement in a plate reader at 515 nm

Protocol for galactose induction and sample preparation to make a growth curve
This protocol describes how to perform galactose induction, and prepare the cells to be loaded into a 96-well plate to make a growth curve using a plate reader.
This protocol has been developed for use with our Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain containing plasmids CB and 1883, to express an artificial cellulosome. All genes are behind a Gal1-Gal10 bidirectional galactose inducible promotor.
Materials
Verduyn medium with 0.5% fructose
Verduyn medium without carbon source
Amino acids, as needed to make your cells grow without losing the plasmids
40% galactose solution
Cellulose, or other carbon source of interest
96-well microtiter plate
Spectrophotometer, e.g. an Implen Nanophotometer
plate reader
Method
Culturing and induction
Culture strains on Verduyn medium with 0,5% fructose and appropriate amino acids. Fructose is chosen as carbon source, as glucose actively represses the Gal1-Gal10 promotor. Incubate at 30 ℃ with agitation.
When the cultures reach an OD600 of between 0.5-0.8, induce the cultures with 2% final concentration galactose (50 µl per ml of 40% stock solution).
Incubate the cultures for 2-6 hours at 30 ℃ with agitation.
Transfer 1ml of culture to a microcentrifuge tube.
Pellet the cells in a microcentrifuge, 5 minutes at 6000 RPM.
Remove the supernatant and resuspend in fresh Verduyn medium without carbon source.
Pellet the cells as in step 5.
Remove the supernatant and resuspend in fresh Verduyn medium without carbon source.
Pellet the cells as in step 5.
Remove the supernatant and resuspend in fresh Verduyn medium without carbon source.
Measure the OD of the resuspended pellet using a spectrophotometer. Due to the small sample volume, a Nanophotometer or Nanodrop style spectrophotometer would be ideal.
Dilute the cells to an OD of 1.0. A volume of 20 µl per well is needed.
Preparing a 96-well plate:
Load each well with the desired carbon source. In our situation 25 ul of 0.8% phosphorylated cellulose or 20 µl ball-milled ReCell is added.
Add Verduyn medium with appropriate amino acids, without carbon source to each well, up to a total volume of 180 µl.
Add 20 µl of cells from step 12 to each well.  Each well should now contain 200 µl of sample.
Insert the 96-well plate into the plate reader, and setup the desired machine settings. In our situation: Kinetic measurement, measure every 20 minutes or every hour, for a period of 24 or 48 hours, with continuous agiation, and incubator temperature set at 30 ℃.
His-tagged protein purification
- The culturing conditions are 37℃, 200 rpm unless mentioned differently.
- Buffers were cooled to 4℃.
- From step 3 onwards all steps were carried out on ice or at 4℃.
Buffer A: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 100 mM KCl, 20% glycerol
Wash Buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 100 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole
Elution Buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 100 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, 300 mM imidazole
A 25 mL overnight culture was inoculated into 1 L fresh culturing medium with the appropriate antibiotics
The cultures were induced with a final concentration of 1mM IPTG at an OD600 between 0.6 and 0.8
The cultures were induced for 2.5 hours and transferred to ice subsequently
Cultures were centrifuged in 1 L centrifuge bottles for 10 min at 6500 rpm to pellet the cells (JLA 9.1000)
The supernatant is discarded
The cell pellet is resuspended into approximately 6 mL of buffer A
An appropriate amount of DNase is added and the cells are disrupted in a cell disrupter (13 kPsi, 1 passage)
The cell lysate is transferred into 50 ml centrifuge tubes and filled up to 50 ml with buffer A
The cell lysate is centrifuged for 10 min at 3500 rpm (JA 25.50) to pellet cell debris
The supernatant was transferred to new tubes and centrifuged again for 15 min at 19.000 rpm (JA 25.50)
The supernatant was incubated with washed Nickel-charged affinity beads for 1 hour. His-tag purification: samples were taken from all fractions during the purification process for analysis by SDS-PAGE
The suspension was filtered through a Biorad disposable column to collect the Nickel beads
The beads were washed twice with 8 mL wash buffer
Protein was eluted twice with 200 µl elution buffer
The elution fractions were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80℃ until further use
PAL2 assay raw lysate
Requirements:
-TRIS HCl 20 mM pH 8.0
-Stock phenylalanine 15 mM
-Stock trans-cinnamic acid 3 mM
-Nanophotometer (or plate reader)
-Thermocycler (or water bath/heat block)
-~3,26 mg/ml final concentration of total protein
Steps:
Make a dilution series for trans-cinnamic acid, in the range of the final concentration of phenylalanine (will be diluted 5 times).
Measure absorbance at 268 nm, derive extinction coefficient from calibration curve.
Make phenylalanine dilution series (15 - 1.25 mM).
Setup reactions on ice: (example)
a. 75 µl TRIS
b. 5 µl enzyme solution (20x)
c. 20 µl phenylalanine solution (5x)
d. 100 µl total volume
Incubate at 37℃ for 20 minutes.
Stop reaction by heating at 80+℃ for 5 minutes
Measure absorbance of product at 268 nm, calculate concentrations.
If purified enzymes were used, kinetic parameters could be derived from this information, however we used PAL2 as a native enzyme.
