As production of plastics can be a sensitive subject, Human Practices was important from the very start of our project. </P><P>As Human Practices is not binary, but a continuous and constant process. Here provide a summary of the biggest influences on the design of our project. Additionally, many insights were gained by talking to our friends, family and complete strangers. One of the first questions was always: “why more plastics?”. We have discussed this with several experts and investigated the advantages and disadvantages of different plastics. We looked into both <A target="_blank" href="Human_Practices#katjaloosinterview">‘biodegradable’ plastics</A>, as well as non-biodegradable  plastics. </P><P>The starting point of our project was a look at the world as it is. We have marvelous technologies which make our lives better, things that were problems 100 years ago are forgotten and information can be shared faster than ever. However, there is also something terribly wrong with this world. Temperature is rising, animals go extinct: our advancement is at the cost of the planet.</P><P>We love all these advancements. We would lie if we say we did not, but we do want to solve the downside of our development. Therefore, we took a closer look at plastic. Plastic is a wonderful product and these days it is impossible to live without it. We looked into the production of plastic. Can we make clean plastic non-polluting plastic? And how do we use this plastic responsibly? On the Human Practices pages you'll found where our journey brought us; from schools to festivals; from start-ups to multinationals. 
				</P></DIV><DIV class="column"><H1 id="carbonfootprint">Carbon footprint analysis</H1><H3>Producing styrene from organic waste</H3><H4>The aim</H4><P>We are facing a huge increase in global population: from the current world population of 7.6 billion to an expected 9.8 billion people in 2050 [<A target="_blank" href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/publications/world-population-prospects-the-2017-revision.html">1</A>]. This projected increase in global population leads to an increase in both food and energy consumption, which in turn in is associated with an increased emission of greenhouse gasses. Right now, we live in a plastic generation. The global production and consumption of plastics have been on the rise for over 50 years now, reaching a plastic consumption of 297.5 million tons by the end of 2015 [<A target="_blank" href="http://www.worldwatch.org/global-plastic-production-rises-recycling-lags-0">2</A>]. Plastic products from the petrochemical industry have a high carbon footprint (Boonniteewanich, Pitivut, Tongjoy, &amp; Lapnonkawow, 2014). The combination of global population increase and a mass consumed non-eco-friendly product, in the form of petroleum-based plastics, could be disastrous. This is one of the reasons that the Groningen iGEM team’s project attempts to produce (bio)styrene, a building block for many plastics, from cellulose as an alternative to petroleum-based styrene. In this section we have carried out a partial Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to identify the environmental impact of both petroleum-based styrene and bio-based styrene. The main purpose is to provide an insight in the environmental burden that is caused by the worldwide styrene industry in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (CO2-eq) and to showcase our greener alternative.</P><P>	For our LCA analysis we have used the Dutch Gross Energy Requirements values (GER) Values. These values are used for a ‘cradle to gate’ analysis and include all emissions that are needed to produce a certain product. These process emissions exclude any carbon flux from or to the atmosphere. In the case of a bio-based feedstock this is a complete analysis, because the carbon uptake is balanced with the emissions once the product is disposed of. For fossil fuel based styrene a value of 3,1 KG needs to be added to this  (Croezen &amp; Lieshout, 2015) because these emission will lead to a net carbon emission. (see figure 1) (Croezen &amp; Lieshout, 2015). A full LCA should also include other impact categories, however it is decided not to include these; we discovered the LCA analysis in a late phase of the project which forced us to simplify the analysis. </P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><I>Figure 1. Figure retrieved from: <A target="_blank" href="http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1021-20192013000200001">http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1021-20192013000200001</A></I></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H4>Analysis</H4><P>
					For our analysis, we compared the process of producing styrene from a bio-based feedstock to the process of producing styrene with petroleum as a feedstock. To define the cradle to gate emission of petroleum-based styrene we contacted two experts of the company CE Delft, the authors of a report stating the GER for industrial feedstock (Croezen &amp; Lieshout, 2015). With their expert help, we were able to define the cradle to gate emission of petroleum-based styrene for our analysis, the value being: 7.8 CO2-eq per kilogram styrene.
				</P><P>
					Now we need to compare the GER of petroleum-based styrene with the GER of our StyGreen. In order to do this we need to define the GER of StyGreen. The first step in defining the amount of CO2-eq per kilogram StyGreen is: defining the feedstock. We explored many different <A target="_blank" href="Applied_Design#source">feedstock options</A>. After comparing many possibilities, we decided to use recycled toilet paper. The main reason for this choice was the sustainability aspect. Recycled toilet paper is not used for anything at this moment. Therefore, it could be argued that it does not hold monetary value or even a negative monetary value. This means that we can add value to the life-cycle of toilet paper. Another reason for choosing toilet paper, is that we do not want to compete with the food industry. It might be feasible to use sugar, or first generation resources to produce styrene, but this does not fit into our view of a better world. 
				</P><P>
					The second step was to calculate the carbon footprint of recycled toilet paper. The carbon footprint of a feedstock in a certain phase of the Life-Cycle analysis is proportional to the monetary value the feedstock holds in that particular phase. Since the recycled toilet paper is derived from paper, we looked into the monetary value of recycled toilet paper in combination to the resource, paper. After this we looked at the price of the toilet paper, and compared to the price of wood. This way, we could make a parallel to the toilet paper CO2-eq. The cradle to grave carbon emission of paper is 0.9 CO2-eq per kg paper (Croezen &amp; Lieshout, 2015; figure 2 gives a visual representation of the factors determining the carbon emission of paper feedstock). 
				</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><I>Figure 2. Life cycle assessment of offset paper production (Silva et al., 2015). </I></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>
					The cost of paper is €150 per ton. Due to the fact that toilet paper recycling is still in its infancy, it was hard to define the representative price for this resource. However, after talking to several experts(<A target="_blank" href="Human_Practices#porter">as you see here</A>), we came to a price estimate of  €15 per ton. Since, toilet paper holds 10% of the monetary value of paper, we divided the CO2-eq by 10 as well, giving our recycled toilet paper feedstock a carbon footprint of 0.09 CO2-eq per kilogram.

If our genetically engineered yeast had a 100% conversion rate, we would need 10 kilograms of recycled toilet paper to produce 1 kg of StyGreen (based on the theoretical maximum yield). Which would mean that the carbon footprint of our StyGreen would be 2.129 CO2-eq per kg. </P><FIGURE><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TH>Process assumptions</TH></TR><TR><TD>(a)Size of our bioreactor (in liters)</TD><TD>500</TD></TR><TR><TD>(b)Heating of water (per degree per 1000 liter/MJ)</TD><TD>4.19</TD></TR><TR><TD>(c) Temperature in bioreactor (in degrees Celsius)</TD><TD>30</TD></TR><TR><TD>(d) Ambient temperature (in degrees Celsius)</TD><TD>10</TD></TR><TR><TD>(e) Contribution exothermic reaction</TD><TD>10</TD></TR><TR><TD>(f) Heat loss (per 24 hour per degree in MJ)</TD><TD>0.03</TD></TR><TR><TD>(g) Calorific value of natural gas (m3)</TD><TD>32</TD></TR><TR><TD>(h) Natural gas (CO2/m3)</TD><TD>1.8</TD></TR><TR><TD>(i) Process time in bioreactor (in days)</TD><TD>3</TD></TR><TR><TD>(j) KG Styrene per bioreactor</TD><TD>1</TD></TR><TR><TD>Energy requirements (MJ)</TD><TD>21.85</TD></TR><TR><TD>Process emissions (CO2 per kg)</TD><TD>1.229</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><FIGCAPTION><I>Table 2. The predicted process emissions of producing StyGreen in our bioreactor[<A target="_blank" href="http://www.joostdevree.nl/shtmls/warmtestroom.shtml ">3</A>] </I></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>This is a lot better than 7.8 CO2-eq per kg for petroleum-based styrene. However, at this point in time our conversion are not yet 100%. For each kilo of styrene we produce, we need 263 kilograms of cellulose (recycled toilet paper) <A target="_blank" href="Model/Flux_Based_Analyses">right now</A>. This would result in 24.89 CO2-eq per kg, which is way worse than regular (petroleum-based) styrene. This partly due to the assumptions made in the flux model, which assumes that yeast needs have a net biomass gain at all times. While, that is not necessary in our bioreactor. Moreover, the first version of our yeast is just a proof of concept. There are still a lot of parts that can be optimized. Both in the yeast strain itself, in the form of knock-outs, and in the bioreactor, by reducing the process emissions.  </P><H4>Conclusions</H4><OL><LI> Toilet paper waste is used as the primary raw material in the biorefinery to produce styrene.

The other reason is we can add value to this product.</LI><LI> Currently the process is not sustainable (based on flux model, with mass balance of 263 : 1) </LI><LI> We could still optimize our process a lot, so we should be able to decrease the mass balance by a lot. And starting from a mass balance of 33 : 1 we are cleaner than petroleum-based styrene </LI><LI> We can also improve the process emissions, lower process emissions means our mass balance can be higher (at the moment the process emissions are more than 28% of the total emissions of petroleum-based styrene). </LI></OL></DIV><H1>Safety</H1><DIV class="column"><P> Safety should be a cornerstone of every project, taken into account during every phase. For this reason the Dutch Governmental Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM) has challenged us to participate in their Safe-by-Design assignment. The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate how our team has taken safety into account throughout our project, in every aspect. Of particular importance is the human practices part, where our ideas get taken outside the lab and into the world surrounding us. Of special interest is the iterative process, where the direction of the project is adjusted based on input from stakeholders and experts in relevant fields, safety and ethical guidelines, and considerations regarding the upscaling of our project. We have had 2 Skype meetings with staff members of the RIVM, and using their tips and guidance we made some more adjustment. The final product, an infographical timeline describing the iterative process of our project, is pictured below.

					To investigate our position and opportunities on the market, we performed a Five Forces analysis. Here, we looked at the strengths of our buyers and suppliers, substitutes for our product, competition and new entrants. The results indicate that we have a beneficial position in relation to our suppliers as there are multiple sources of cellulose. However, the buyers have a high switching cost, which is a potential threat to our technology. For new entrants, a large amount of prior knowledge is needed to enter the market, which is one of our strengths.

					The young, Groningen based biotech startup <A target="_blank" href="http://evbio.tech/">EV Biotech</A> offered to  collaborate with us in many aspects. Represented by Linda Dijkshoorn, Agnieszka Wegryzn and Sergey Lunev, EVBiotech was present at multiple meetings with our subgroups. Linda had fantastic tips about structure and organisation, and helped us to set up a SCRUM way of working. Agnieszka is an expert on modelling and helped a great deal with the flux balance analysis. Sergey helped us to set up the concept of a continuous bioreactor. Over the summer we had ten meetings to discuss our progress on the project. Next to technical help, we also profited greatly by gaining access to the big network of EV Biotech. As a special honor, we were invited to the official opening of the new EV Biotech office. Here we had the opportunity to pitch our project to several experienced business people.

For example, 19 billion Lego elements are produced every year. This equals 2.16 million elements every hour, or 36.000 per minute. This premium toy-giant with an annual revenue of 4.8 billion USD (2017) is highly interested in swapping their current ABS feedstock to a more sustainable non-crude oil derived source. The Vice-President Materials of a Toy Multinational made time to sit down with us, despite a very full agenda. We discussed what drives companies when making transitioning decisions, what toy companies look for in materials and what to take into account throughout development. 
				</P><P>While diving into the many applications of styrene, what most interested us was an application of styrene as raw material for a non-single use plastic. This was one of the drivers which pointed us towards Lego bricks: durable playing bricks for playful development. It turns out our visions align. During the course of our project, Lego has published various articles and press releases about their ambition to produce plant-based plastic playing bricks. The mentioned Vice-President Materials was happy to sit down with us to share views on the future of biobased plastics, as well as discussing some opportunities and limitations with regards to their production. Our discussion was highly insightful. Some highlights which will shape the future of our project:</P></DIV><DIV class="column third_size"><H4 style="text-align: center !important;font-style: italic !important;font-size: 1.6em !important;padding: 40px !important;background: #e2e2e2 !important;"> Your choice for a 2G feedstock highly excites me  </H4></DIV><DIV class="column"><OL><LI>From 1G to 2G feedstock: the Vice-President Materials is enthusiastic about our choice of a 2G feedstock: highlighting circularity, and also addressed a challenge we proposed, the loss of biomass to oxygen, stating that because our feedstock is 0-value this is not a problem!  Being a second generation feedstock, “sludge” (our toilet paper waste stream) does not compete with food supply. </LI><LI>“Side effects” of transitioning to bio-based plastic: to guarantee trusted product characteristics for injection moulding playing bricks, every mould is tailored to the specific properties of the plastic used to inject the mould of the individual bricks. Transitioning for a multinational like this does not just mean searching for the right material. It means transforming the entire production process. Therefore, there is little room for errors when switching to a new composition. </LI><LI>Importance of constant feedstock: scale, constant (reliable) product with uniform properties: We were pointed towards an important bottleneck of bioplastics: going from start-up to scale up. In order to supply industrials, a reliable feedstock is necessary. Therefore, throughout developing StyGreen in the lab ample attention needs to be given to possible commercialization. Read about our dive into this on our <A target="_blank" href="Entrepeneurship"> Entrepeneurship</A> page.</LI><LI>Minimizing steps in the production process: Minimizing production process steps is appealing when producing plastics. Minimizing steps in the production process will contribute to the success of StyGreen, for example by minimizing energy consumption.

Mr. van Dord thought our project was very interesting, since we came up with a new way to produce bioplastics. However, he was wondering why we would focus so much on styrene. Why not create a new bioplastic with even better qualities? He also stated that the business case should be a part in the project in order to get a better insight in the potential of genetically manufactured or engineered bioplastics and the scale of economic feasible production facilities.

					We have been in touch with employees of <A target="_blank" href="https://bioclearearth.nl/">Bioclear Earth</A>, who gave us great suggestions on the financial aspects of our project. Because pure cellulose is more expensive than glucose, we needed to find a cellulose-rich waste stream which we could use in our process. They came up with the idea to use recycled toilet paper, which can not be used for other purposes due to its public perception. Subsequently, they explained to us how the market for enzymes works and also connected us with various people in the market. Additionally, they told us about various parties that are working on the conversion of cellulose into glucose. Lastly they gave us the suggestion to use glucose instead of cellulose for our project. However, we decided this was not feasible as we do not want to be competing with the the food industry.

Avantium is chemically breaking down wood chips to hemicellulose, glucose and lignin. Their technology allows them to break down cellulose with acid to glucose monomers in one reactor with high yields while recovering the acid. We are trying to do exactly the same, but enzymatically by employing our cellulosome. We agreed to test the suitability of Avantiums glucose for growth medium for our cells. Beyond that we learned a lot about the process of valorizing innovations in general. They gave us many insights regarding the financial and technical bottlenecks that stand between a promising idea and a large scale profitable industrial process. We were impressed by Avantiums technology as it is robust, works with almost any type of wood and requires only very little material preparation, especially in comparison to our enzymatic approach. An important take-away for us was that we have to consider the expenses and environmental implications of our cellulose pretreatment (grinding, autoclaving, phosphorylating) as well.

					As suggested by the Science Shop, we got into contact with Pieter Imhof of <A target="_blank" href="https://www.biobtx.nl/">BioBTX</A>. This company produces chemical intermediates out of biomass, however they use a chemical process. They explained to us how they use pyrolysis and combine this with a catalytic conversion step. In this way they are able to reach aromatics yields of approximately 30-70%, with BTX (Benzene, Toluene, Xylene) yields ranging from 5-40%, with yields dependent on the feedstock and used process conditions. 
					Regarding our project, Mr. Imhof thought that the process of turning glucose into styrene does not have high enough yields to be economically feasible. However, he thought that the conversion of cellulose to glucose in one reactor, combined with glucose to styrene conversion could be an interesting improvement. Additionally, he explained that CO2 is released at every chemical reaction step, the magnitude depending on reaction conditions. So, whereas our method would not be able to meet industrial needs, it would likely be greener than the chemical process of refining biomass, and significantly better than a fossil based process. These steps come together in the Life Cycle Analysis, which can be found on the wiki and in given references. Mr. Imhof explained to us that we should not go too deep into this and provided us with helpful references about their own research.

Together with the university, they went to the University Holding, to get an initial investment. From this point on a biorefinery plan, business plan and LCA were made to attract more investors. He told us that it is important to have a good business plan and LCA when you look for investors, because these are the things that people will look at. Another good way to get income is using different subsidies. Photanol now has an industrial partner with whom they work together to scale their project up further. Wilmar adviced us to contact the GGO bureau and to keep close contact with them, as they know everything about safety and regulations. Especially in the phase where we are in now, it is good to contact them so we can put the safety into the design of our project. One example is that a GMO can never outcompete its wild-type.

					3D printing with ABS plastic is possible, but it has some drawbacks, hence we decided to collaborate with Fablab Groningen without actually using StyGreen for 3D printing. We quickly realized that 3D printed biological structures can be of great educational value. Therefore, we made prints of the most important enzymes in our project: the cellulose binding domain, the endogluconase, the beta-glucosidase and the Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase. We also printed some of their ligands and matched them size wise to showcase where the pocket with the active site in the enzyme is and which chemical alteration is happening.
					We also developed a kit of building blocks for styrene, butadiene, acrylnitril and divinylbenzene that can showcase the process of copolymerization through magnets. On top of that our mascot Styrene Steve was 3D printed multiple times and given as present to some of our sponsors as a nice gesture and to keep iGEM in people’s minds.

NIOZ is the Royal Dutch Institute for Sea Research, and is involved in research in the Netherlands as well as far beyond the Dutch border on topics such as biology, physics, chemistry and geography. We spoke with Prof. dr. Timmermans about our design and the potential usage of cellulose from green algae for our iGEM project. Currently, green algae are mainly cultured for their proteins and partly for their carbohydrate content. However, cellulose is a residual product at the moment, for which no suitable purpose has been found at NIOZ. In case we can show a proof-of-concept in our iGEM project, we could close the loop in green algae culturing, so all fractions are used. Prof. dr. Timmermans informed us  that there is still a long way to go before culturing green algae on the open sea is reality. On top of that, the separation of the different fractions (proteins, carbohydrates, etc.) proves to be difficult. All in all, the potential upside is enormous, once the research on culturing green algae has developed further. We are then able to tap into an infinite source of cellulose and use all fractions of the cultured green algae. A win-win situation.

					The first meeting was with Korienke Smit, a policy advisor, and Niek Savelkoul, a trainee and member of the 2017 iGEM Wageningen team. This meeting took place on june 20th, 2018.
					During this meeting we discussed our initial ideas about how we are planning to implement the Safety-by-Design concept into our project. We got some valuable tips and input, especially about the upscaling of our process, which brings a whole set of new challenges with it, something we had not considered until then. We were planning to use antibiotics, which might be difficult to upscale safely regarding antibiotic resistance issues. Styrene is toxic, and having massive bioreactors filled with styrene-producing yeast strains could be a danger to public health. We were already considering to use CRISPR-Cas9 to remove the need for antibiotics, but these remarks contributed to our decision to make the switch. Another factor was our plan to run evolutionary experiments to improve yields. Korienke had suggestions for this as well, and suggested looking into the 2017 Heidelberg iGEM team, that came up with a clever way to accelerate evolution using quickly-mutating phages.

					We went to Francesco Picchioni, an expert in the field of polymers, to ask his view on styrene and our project design. Did he see the benefits, or would he think it was an unrealistic design? He explained to us that styrene is a very good material for various reasons. The first is its transparency, which is why it is easily colored with other chemicals. Styrene furthermore contains an aromatic ring and pi-pi stackings of these rings. This leads to the fact that styrene-based plastics have a high TG (Glass Transition Temperature). These connections are way stronger compared to the ester bonds in PET and PLA. No other plastics have these special characteristics, and therefore styrene is irreplaceable. Right now, styrene is not recycled to a high extent, as the price of newly produced styrene is lower. However, because styrene is a thermoplastic, it is easily recycled in case of a stronger market pull. Picchioni was suprised that biological styrene production was feasible. If a high yield can be engineered, this would be a major discovery and he would be very interested.

Furthermore he suggested performing an evolution experiment in <I>S. cerevisiae</I> to decrease the sensitivity of our yeast towards styrene. </P><H4 style="text-align: center !important;font-style: italic !important;font-size: 1.6em !important;padding: 40px !important;background: #e2e2e2 !important;"> An evolution experiment in S. cerevisae to decrease toxic effects from styrene  </H4></DIV><DIV class="column two_thirds_size"><H4> Shreyans Chordia (27th September 2018)</H4><P>
						Shreyans Chordia, a PhD student at the Biomolecular Chemistry &amp; Catalysis group, works on styrene production in <I>E. coli</I> and provided us with an <I>E. coli</I> codon optimized version of the PAL2 gene. Shreyans has been able to produce styrene in <I>E. coli</I> at quite significant levels. He suggested the possibility of coculturing our cellulose degrading yeast strain with his styrene producing <I>E. coli</I> to convert cellulose to styrene in one bioreactor. He offered to help with the experimental setup and conducting the experiments. Furthermore, he got us in contact with Balin Fridrich, who works on the degradation of lignocellulose. </P><H4 style="text-align: center !important;font-style: italic !important;font-size: 1.6em !important;padding: 40px !important;background: #e2e2e2 !important;"> Shreyans was able to produce styrene at quite significant levels </H4></DIV><DIV class="column two_thirds_size"><H4> Prof. Dr. Marco Fraaije (20th July 2018)</H4><P>
						Professor Marco Fraaije is an expert in the fields of biology, biochemistry, biotechnology and in particular enzyme engineering. His group published an extremely useful article for our project describing a fast and sensitive method for the detection of cellulase activity. We had a fruitful discussion about the assay described in the paper. One of the subjects that we discussed was the feasibility to detect cellulase activity with the assay while using our intact yeast cells instead of purified proteins. Finally, professor Fraaije provided us with the possibility for assistance, usage of the lab and supplied the materials required for the experiments.</P><H4 style="text-align: center !important;font-style: italic !important;font-size: 1.6em !important;padding: 40px !important;background: #e2e2e2 !important;"> How to detect cellulase activity? </H4></DIV><DIV class="column two_thirds_size"><H4> Dr. W.C. Szymanski (27th September 2018)</H4><P>
						Szymanski is an assistant professor, at the department of radiology and imaging, at the UMCG (University Medical Center Groningen). His fields of interests are molecular medical imaging and photopharmacology. Wiktor Szymanski was willing to help us optimize the protocol for the phosphorylation of cellulose at the 6th position. Furthermore, he was of great help performing the experiment and provided us with a lab and equipment for the experiment. The phosphorylation of cellulose was performed to increase the solubility of the polymer. The improved solubility resulted in an improved accessibility of the cellulosome complex towards the cellulose polymer. The cellulosome complex chops the cellulose polymer into glucose molecules. These glucose molecules are obtained by the yeast cells, as carbon source, and converted into styrene molecules.</P><H4 style="text-align: center !important;font-style: italic !important;font-size: 1.6em !important;padding: 40px !important;background: #e2e2e2 !important;"> Szymanski helped us to optimize the phosphorylation of cellulose  </H4></DIV><DIV class="column two_thirds_size"><H4> Intellectual Property Office RUG (8th October 2018)</H4><P>
						To see if we could patent parts of our project, we contacted the IP center of the University of Groningen. We discussed three important subjects: inventorship, novelty and inventivity. The first subject we had to discuss was inventorship. Who contributed substantially to our project? Besides our team members, to what extent were the supervisors part of our idea? After consulting other iGEM teams, we decided that the patent should be shared with the supervisors. For the novelty of our project, it was important that the to be patented subject was not published already. We encountered problems with our own disclosure here due to our outreach and education activities. The most difficult part of a patent is the inventivity. Since we combine several methods of degrading cellulose together, this was an important option for patenting. Subsequently, we also had to think about the financial aspects of the patent. Would companies pay to use our technology? We discussed this factor with several investors and several companies that are highly interested in our product. </P></DIV><DIV class="column"><H4>References</H4><P>Boonniteewanich, J., Pitivut, S., Tongjoy, S., &amp; Lapnonkawow, S.
