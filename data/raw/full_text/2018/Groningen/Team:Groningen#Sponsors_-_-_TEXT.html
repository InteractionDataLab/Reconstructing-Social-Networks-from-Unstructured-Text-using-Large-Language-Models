Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials
ZIAM’s mission is the design and scientific study of materials for functionality. The strength of the institute lies in focused, curiosity-driven, symbiotic studies of functional materials involving researchers from physics, chemistry and biology. Their main driving force is the desire to understand how things work at the microscopic level. In the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials covers the whole chain from synthesizing materials, building devices, characterizing materials and devices, and investigating the theoretical foundation of their properties.
Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (JBI)
The mission of the JBI is to perform outstanding academic research and teaching in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Artificial Intelligence, and to maintain international leadership herein; to foster these disciplines as a living body of knowledge, and to make it relevant to society in its broadest sense. The symbiosis between pure and applied science, and between mono- and multidisciplinary research and teaching, is a distinguishing characteristic of the institute. As an important part of this mission we aim to transfer our results to other areas of science and technology, and initiate and expand inter- and multi-disciplinary research collaborations.
Molecular Dynamics
The MD group, headed by Prof. S.J. Marrink, is embedded in the GBB Institute and affiliated with the Zernike Institute, and participates in the Berendsen Center for Multiscale Modeling and Material Design. Using a computational approach, the group simulates the dynamics of (bio)molecular processes. The aim is to understand and predict macroscopic behaviour of complex systems on the basis of the effective interactions between atoms.
ENgineering and TEchnology institute Groningen (ENTEG)
The research institute ENTEG is an engineering science and technology institute that has the capability to analyse, explore and design new technologies that are based on the integration of fundamental and engineering sciences. As such, the research in the institute focuses on current and future activities in a number of processing and production sectors such as processing, high tech and discrete production and interface industries. In addition, ENTEG has developed and contributed to several academic engineering education programmes of which the degrees provide an international starting qualification for graduated students for high quality jobs in industry, and research.
GUF
The Groningen University Fund (“GUF”) was founded on March 4, 1893 by the professors of the Groningen University. The aim of the GUF is to promote in the widest sense the study at the Groningen University. As means to archive this aim the Fund sustains among others the following activities: subsidizing study-related travel abroad by students subsidizing student excursions (accompanied by staff members) subsidizing scientific, cultural or sports activities by students within the framework of a student organizatio subsidizing the organisation in Groningen or the northern Netherlands of international scientific conferences, symposia or workshops by scientists of the Groningen University financially facilitating seminars or lectures by scientists from abroad facilitate the establishment of specialized expert chairs (“bijzondere leerstoelen”) at the Groningen University
Stratingh Institute
The Stratingh Institute for Chemistry is a research institute at the Faculty of Science and Engineering of the University of Groningen.
