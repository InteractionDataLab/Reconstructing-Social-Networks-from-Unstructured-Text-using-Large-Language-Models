Six hours of incubation at 37℃, 200 rpm
1000 µl of the 6 hour time point culture was pipetted into an eppendorf tube and kept on ice until further use in a box with ice at 4℃.
100 µl of these cell cultures were transferred into wells of a 96-microtiter plate.
However, while analyzing our results, we realized that we did not set the ‘gain’ setting for fluorescence measurement in the plate reader to a fixed number across the different measurements. Therefore, we need to repeat this measurement.
Aim Correlate OD600 measurements in our plate reader to colony forming units (CFU)
We first diluted the overnight cultures of the negative and positive control 1:8 and measured OD600 in our plate reader. We then further diluted these cultures to target OD600 0.1, confirmed by our plate reader and plated onto plates in several dilutions.
Aim Calibration experiments for the Interlab study
LUDOX, silica beads and fluorescein experiments as described on our interlab page were also performed. As described above, the fluorescein calibration needs to be repeated.
The exact protocol can be found here and the results of these experiments can be found on our Interlab page .

Strains are grown in Verduyn medium and induced with galactose
1 ml samples were stored at -20℃ at 0, 24 and 48 hours
OD 600 were measured of 10x diluted transformant cultures.
4mL of each culture was removed and spun down, the rest was left to grow diluted in 4mL of auxotrophic media.
Spun-down cells were resuspended in 5mL of their respective auxotrophic media. 260 uL of 40% galactose was added.
Samples were incubated overnight.
The OD measurements were found to be inaccurate halfway through the experiment, these were not taken into account during sample preparation, meaning that different concentrations of cells were exposed to the same concentration of Galactose.

Restriction digest was incubated at 37℃ for 2 hours and inactivated by heating to 80℃ for 20 minutes. The mixture was finally held at 4℃
Restriction analysis on scaffold
Colonies were picked previously by Rianne. 10 of these were selected for restriction analysis to verify the transformation. For the plasmid containing CipA3, the enzyme SmaI was used. SmaI has two recognition sites on the empty plasmid, pHIPZ7, producing one fragment of 4.6kb and one of 900b. When the gene is successfully inserted it will remove one of the recognition sites, producing only one large fragment of roughly 8.2kb.
The following scheme was used to prepare the reaction mixtures for all restriction digests of the CipA3 containing plasmids.

Aim Ligation of BGLI into pHIPZ7
Since BGLI was the only sample with a proper PCR signal, it was attempted to ligate into pHIPZ7, our standard yeast expression plasmid.
First, double restriction with BamHI and XhoI was done using the following scheme:

The reaction was performed at 37℃ for two hours after which the enzymes were inactivated by heating the sample at 80℃ for 20 minutes.
This product was purified by using a PCR purification column to remove the enzymes and buffer components.
Next the product was mixed with linearized plasmid at a 1:3 weight ratio and T4 ligase was added to ligate the product into the plasmid.

The reaction was performed overnight at 16℃ after which the enzyme was inactivated by heat treatment at 80℃ for 20 minutes.
The product was again cleaned up and Taq polymerase was performed to verify insertion. The general sequence primers were used as these should give a large product when a sequence has inserted at the restriction site and a small product otherwise.
PCR conditions were standard Taq conditions with an annealing temperature of 50℃ as the melting temperature of the primers was quite low.
Who: Ingeborg
Aim Restriction digest of EGII and CBHII
Restriction digest
For the plasmids containing EGII and CBHII, the enzyme NCOI was used.
NCOI has one recognition site on the empty plasmid, pHIPZ7, producing one fragment of 5.8kb. When the EGII gene is successfully inserted it will add one recognition site, producing one large fragment of roughly 6.4kb and a smaller fragment of 967b.
When the CBHII gene is successfully inserted it will add two recognition sites, producing one large fragment of roughly 5.5kb and two smaller fragments, a fragment of 1186b and one of 766b.
The following scheme was used to prepare the reaction mixtures for all restriction digests of the EGII and CBHII containing plasmids.

The amount of DNA to add was calculated such that a final content of 250 ng of DNA would be reached.
The restriction digest was incubated at 37℃ for 2 hours, after which the enzymes were inactivated by heating at 80C for 20 minutes.
Restriction analysis on gel
The restriction analysis of the EGII and CBHII containing plasmids was run on an agarose gel. 1% of agarose was used in TAE buffer. 5 µl of SYBR green was added to 50 ml of agarose in TAE as prescribed by the manual. The gel was run at 100V for about 55 minutes after which it was imaged using a UV light source. As a standard DNA ladder, 1 kb generuler was added to the well in the middle.

Aim Restriction analysis of BGL1 and PAL2
The colonies have grown overnight and are miniprepped to isolate the plasmids. The BGL1 plasmids, along with a pHIPZ7 control plasmid are restricted with XbaI. The PAL2 plasmids are not processed, as it turns out the PCR reaction didn’t add the needed restriction sites. Therefore these plasmids cannot be correct.

Results
Lane 1 and 2 contain the PCR reaction PAL2. No fragment was amplified, this is most likely due to incorrect purification of the genomic DNA. Lane 3-6, 8-13, 15-20 contain the restriction samples of both pMEL16-Aga2tar and pMEL16-Aro10tar. 2 bands are expected due to Bcl1 cutting the plasmid 3 times with insertion of the target sequence. As only one band is visible no positive hits seem to be present. However, after further inspection it was found out that Bcl1 cannot cut methylated DNA. It was decided that the region of interest would be sequenced to verify.

Aim The aims of the RP-HPLC validation runs are to evaluate the available RP-HPLC system in the Linnaeusborg, to discover the retention time of styrene, to test if styrene elutes at all, to optimize the available parameters of the RP-HPLC for optimal measurement, to validate the sample preparation and to come up with a standardizeable procedure that can be employed for qualitative styrene analysis for the rest of the project
The shimadzu HPLC system was equipped with a C18 column and with water plus 0 - 100 % acetonitrile as gradient mobile phase. Two runs were done. For the first run 0,1 molar styrene in ethyl acetate solution was injected to find out the retention time and test the Diode Array Detector.
For the second run 0,5 ml ethylacetate, 0,5 ml lysed yeast cell culture and a drop 20 µl styrene were vortexed for 15 minutes. The apolar phase was then filtered over a 0,22 nm nylon membrane and injected into the HPLC system.
The styrene only eluted at a high percentage of acetonitrile as is expected, looking at the log P of 2,7. Therefore another gradient mobile phase was chosen: water with methanol 0 - 100 %. As styrene eluted at a composition of 50 % water 50 % methanol it was chosen to validate a method with a gradient of 30 - 100 % methanol. The retention time of styrene in this run was 17,5 minutes. The UV spectrum recorded at this point in time confirms that styrene is what elutes from the column.

Aim Phosphorylation and characterization of cellulose at position 6
Protocol followed as described in the paper mentioned. Percival Zhang, Y. H., Cui, J., Lynd, L. R. and Kuang, L. R. A transition from Cellulose Swelling to Cellulose Dissolution by o-Phosphoric Acid: Evidence from Enzymatic Hydrolysis and Supramolecular Structure. Biomacromolecules, 7, 644-648 (2006)
Cellulose (200 mg, 0.62 mmol) and distilled water (0.6 mL) were added to a 50 mL glass tube. Slowly, ice cold o-phosphoric acid (15.2M, 10 mL) was added to the mixture under vigorous stirring. The suspension turned into transparent slurry within minutes.
This mixture was stirred for one hour on ice. Subsequently, 40 mL of ice cold water was added resulting in a white clouded suspension. This mixture was centrifuged at 5000g at 4°C for 20 minutes. Then the supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in ice cold water. This mixture was centrifuged at 5000g at 4°C for 10 minutes. The washing cycle was repeated 4 times. Afterwards the pellet was washed one time with Na2CO3 (2M, 1 mL) and ice cold distilled water (39 mL). Finally, the pellet was washed with distilled water until pH 7.
Assumptions made for a successful phosphorylation reaction
The 31p-NMR spectrum showed one peak (-4 ppm), expected to be from phosphoric acid. The lack of the phosphate peak from cellulose is supposed to be due to lack of solubility in D2O. Nevertheless, it is suspected that the phosphorylation of cellulose at the 6th position was successful. Based on the same observation made as were described by the protocol followed[1]. Furthermore, the phosphorylated cellulose dissolved in phosphate buffer, while cellulose was insoluble. Moreover, the cellulase activity assay showed the highest activity for the phosphorylated cellulose, expected to be due to solubility. As a negative control cellulose was chosen, which showed significant less activity.

Even though the restriction analysis on the 2 positive colony PCR hits was negative the plasmids are still transformed into YPH499. This is because a positive colony PCR was only possible when the insert was integrated into the plasmid, due to the selection of primers. Both positive hits are transformed individually and together with the cellulase plasmids.

Who: Jan Marten
Aim Analyze results of cellulose degradation assay
The plate is removed from the plate reader, and the data is downloaded. Immediately a problem is clear. When looking at the plate it is obvious that all the cellulose in the cellulose samples has sticked to one corner of the well, and hasn’t been mixed through the sample properly. This likely happened during the loading of the 96-well plate, as the carbon sources were the first liquids pipetted into the wells. Since these were only 10-20 µl drops, they would have sticked to one corner and not mixed properly throughout the sample. No effort is made to process the data, as no useable information on cellulose will be available.

Use plasmid miniprep kit to isolate plasmids. See restriction protocol . One restriction analysis is performed using NotI creating 2 fragments and one using EcoRI to create a linearized backbone. The second reaction is only performed for pSB1C3-Zcas.
Results
Lane 1-6 contain restriction analyses of pSB1C3-His-EGII. Cutting pSB1C3-His-EGII should gives a fragment of 2kB and a fragment of 1300 bp. This can be seen in the first 2 lanes and a very faint band at 1300 bp in the third lane. Lane 7-9 contain pSB1C3-Zcas restricted with NotI. This should give 2 bands, one of 2kB and 1 of 1300 bp. No bands are present at 1300bp. Lane 10-12 contain pSB1C3-Zcas restricted with EcoRI. A band at 3.3 is expected. This can be seen in all 3 lanes, but there is also a band at 2kB. This band has the same size as linearized pSB1C3. As the bottom ladder bands are less faint than the upper ones, we hypothesized that the imager might detect higher bands better. To test this we turned the gel upside down and imaged it. Bands at 1300 bp can be seen now in lane 1-9. (Gel not shown).

Aim The goal of ball milling cellulose was to evaluate the sample technique ball milling for preparation of Recell cellulose for medium usage.
10 g of unsieved cellulose was ball milled in a Fritsch Pulverisette 6 machine using a ZrO2 cylinder and ZrO2 balls. The choice for zirconia was made based upon its hardness (>8 on Mohs hardness scale). The ball mill required periodical cool down times of 15-20 minutes per 15 minutes of running time. The Ball Mill was started at 9:55 and stopped at 10:10. A small sample (200 mg) was taken (ReCellBM15). The sample taken after 15 minutes was not significantly visibly different from the starting material. The milling process was continued at 10:30.
At 11:00 the Ball Mill was still very warm so it was decided to keep it cooling for another 15 minutes and start the next run at 11:30.
From there on out a 15 minute running and 30 minute cooling pattern was kept until 14:15 which samples taken every time the Ball Mill was stopped (ReCellBM30 - ReCellBM90).
A visual comparison of cellulose with different degrees of milling. All tubes contain 200 mg of cellulose but finer grinded cellulose collapses into a much smaller volume then the original, more fibery cellulose.
The samples of different milling times were also compared by making plates of them and comparing colony number and size after 3 days of cultivating.
After milling and taking samples 8,5 g of very fine, colloid cellulose powder were obtained. Parts of the cellulose were further treated with phosphorylation, hydroxylation and ultra-sonication. All prepared cellulose was ultimately used for growth medium, mostly for liquid cultures with a concentration of 2 g/ 100 ml.

Aim The goal of the GC-MS and GC-FID runs is to have a second qualitative measurement technique for styrene to ensure a reliable proof of concept. Also we wanted to evaluate GC-FID for quantitative information
Sample preparation for GM-HS and GC-FID:
800 µl of liquid culture is pipetted into a 2 ml Eppendorf cup. 720 µl benzene and 80 µl 10 mM 2-methylanisole benzene solution (internal standard) are added. The Eppendorf is then vortexed for 20 minutes and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13.000 rpm. The organic phase is filtered over a 0,2 µM polyethersulfone (PES) disc membrane and brought into cealed GC vial. The GC vial is placed into the GC autosampler and the run is started.
GC-FID calibration curve:
For quantification with the Flame Ionization Detector a calibration curve has to be taken. Eight samples were prepared in duplo with known amounts of styrene, ranging from 0,5 mmol to 5,0 mmol. The samples were injected into the GC-FID system. The retention time of styrene was 3,741 min, the rt of the internal standard was 4,381 min. From the AUCs the Response Ratios (RR) were calculated and a calibration curve was fitted using linear regression.
The result for overnight grown culture that wasn’t fed extra phenylalanine was negative. The result for culture that was fed phenylalanine gave a miniscule peak at the correct retention time (3,7 minutes) but the AUC fell outside of the calibration curve.
The peak of the phenylalanine fed culture was very small and was therefore not viewed as proof of concept of styrene production. It was decided to grow another culture, also fed with phenylalanine, that would grow for 2 days and would be prepared for GC differently. The used GC protocol was made for e.coli and therefore didn’t account for the existence of the yeast cell wall which could hinder desorption of styrene from the lipid bilayer into the aromatic organic phase. It was therefore altered by adding a mechanical cell lysis step.

Aim Cellulase activity assay on (preprocessed) cellulose
Cellulose sources used were: Pure ReCell (R), Ball-milled ReCell (BR), pure cellulose (C) and phosphorylated cellulose (PC). Since ReCell consists of 99% cellulose, of R, BR and C 1% solutions were prepared in incubation buffer (https://2018.igem.org/Team:Groningen/Protocols). Because PC was in an aqueous mixture, the exact percentage could not be estimated precisely. We therefore dissolved 1,23 grams into 5 ml of incubation buffer.
From left to right: R, BR, C, PC. Left before vortexing: only PC stays more in solution. Right: by vortexing, most solutions become evenly distributed except for R.
We purchased enzymes representing our designed CBHI, EGII and BGLI from Megazyme. The purchased enzymes are: cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) from Trichoderma sp., cellulase (endo-I,4-ꞵ-D-glucanase) from A. niger, and ꞵ-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger. We will refer to them as CBH, EG and BGL, respectively. We furthermore purchased a cellulase enzyme blend as a positive control from Sigma-Aldrich (a product of Novozyme).
CBH: 0.05 U/mg
EG: 70 U/mg, 1200 U/mL
BGL: 90 U/mg, 40 U/mL
Cellulase blend: ~1.15 g/mL
Since the assay is suitable for cellulase activity between 6-375 mU, but CBH came in a low concentration, we decided to use a final enzyme concentration of 10 mU for all enzymes to be able to compare their activities.
For these purposes, we diluted all enzymes to 0.05 U/mL concentration, of which we took 20 µl into a final assay volume of 100 µl. For the negative control, 20 µl of buffer was added. The other 80 µl consisted of the cellulose sources suspended in incubation buffer. The assay was further performed according to the protocol . For the image below, the enzymes were incubated with the substrates overnight.
This resulted in the chromogenic pattern as can be seen below. The positive control contains such large amounts of cellulases that it becomes pink in all cases (it is brownish because the blend has a brown color). It appears that the phosphorylated cellulose is best degraded, especially by CBH. The cellulose and ball-milled ReCell can be degraded as well, but need more time.
Row A to D contain R, BR, C and PC, respectively. Lanes 1 to 6 contain BGL, EG, CBH, a mix of 1-3, cellulase blend, negative control, respectively.

Aim SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of PAL2 cell lysate and EGII purification
An SDS-PAGE gel and sample buffer was kindly provided by Marten Exterkate. 15 µl of each sample was mixed with 5 µl of sample buffer and 15 µl was loaded onto the gel for analysis.
PAL2(US) is the soluble fraction of the cell lysate from our culture, whereas PAL2(SB) refers to that of Stanford-Brown and EGII to that of our EGII expressing cell culture. The samples afterwards are fractions during the purification process of EGII. SF is the soluble lysate fraction after incubation with the Nickel beads, FT the flow though after passage through the disposable column. W1 and W2 fractions after the two wash steps, and EF1 and EF2 the two elution fractions.
Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE of cell lysates and purification fractions. Order of the samples: Page Ruler protein ladder, PAL2(US), PAL2(SB), EGII, SF, FT, W1, W2, EF1, EF2. Page Ruler ladder: lowest band upwards: 15 (flat line below), 25, 35, 40, 55, 70, 100, 130, 180 kDa.
We observe a large band in PAL2(US) around the 70 kDa band, which corresponds to the 78 kDa expected height for PAL2. This band is not visible in PAL2(SB), suggesting the protein did not come to (as high) expression in the Stanford Brown strain. For EGII, the second wash is clean, suggesting most non-specific binding proteins have been washed from the beads. The elution fractions however contain multiple bands. EGII has an expected molecular weight of 44 kDa, but the bands on the gel show a larger sized protein. Hence we decided to perform an anti-His Western blot to detect the presence of a His-tagged protein.
The same protein samples were used for another SDS-PAGE gel (15%) and followed by a Western blot which was kindly performed by Dr. Aditya Iyer according to https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UMabJpKOg9ukW-qTmK0ZssQxaB19ZL_LgqrKfKlBn-U/edit . In this case, also a sample of the insoluble pellet fraction was loaded to see if there was any EGII presence (EGII(P)). The other samples are the same as described above.
Western blot EGII. Order of the samples: ladder, EGII(P), EGII, SF, FT, W1, (empty lane), W2, EF1, EF2. The ladder on this blot is Page Ruler Plus, so lowest band of the ladder upwards: 10, 15, 25, 35, 55, 70, 100  kDa.
This shows that the detected His-tagged protein bands are between 35 and 55 kDa, which corresponds with the expected 44 kDa for EGII.
The EGII elution fractions and the PAL2 cell lysates were further used in enzyme activity assays.

Aim EGII activity assay on (preprocessed) cellulose
The cellulase test of 10-10-18 was repeated, but in this case with different enzymes on the same substrates. The total incubation volume was 200 µl instead of 100 µl.
We measured the concentration of the purchased EG and our purified EGII elution fraction on nanodrop (blank MQ):
EG = 9 mg/mL
His-EGII = 0.66 mg/mL
We decided to assume the amount of units in our purified elution fraction will be comparable to the purchased enzyme, and therefore diluted the purchased enzyme tenfold to approximate the His-EGII concentration. We tested undiluted His-EGII, 1:1000 and 1:10.000 dilutions. The samples were measured after 1 hour and overnight incubation, and both gave the following result:
Row A to D contain R, BR, C and PC, respectively. Lanes 1 to 6 contain EG 1:10, His-EGII, His-EGII 1:1000, His-EGII 1:10.000, cellulase blend, negative control, respectively.
We see that the positive control worked on all substrates. The purchased EG enzyme however did not show much activity. Our undiluted EGII showed activity on all substrates except for unprocessed ReCell

Aim The goal of repeating the GC-FID runs with a different sample preparation was to investigate the negative results of the previous run and to obtain reliable styrene quantification
The GC runs were repeated with an improved sample preparation involving mechanical cell lysis through glass beads. The results were analysed on the HPLC by Owen and Jeroen Nijland and by Benno on the GC-FID.
For cell lysis 200 µl worth of glass beads were added to 900 µl worth of liquid culture in a 1,5 ml Eppendorf cup. The Eppendorf was vortexed for 10 minutes and subsequently spun down at 13.000 rpm for 1 minute. 800 µl of the supernatant were used for the described GC sample preparation.
Liquid cultures of two promising PAL2 positive colonies were grown to OD , a negative control sample was also included.
Due to a miscommunication these supposedly superior samples originated from cells that were not supported with Phenylalanine in their grow medium.
The GC-FID results of all three measurements were negative.
One potential explanation of this result is, that glass bead cell lysis is usually performed in 1 minute steps with 1 min ice cooling steps in between to prevent enzyme degradation. As enzymes are of no interest to our measurement this was skipped. During the 10 minutes of vortexing the movement of the glass beads could have risen the temperature of the contained liquid so much that styrene evaporated and left the Eppendorf immediately after opening.
The GC-FID runs therefore only give qualitative and not quantitative styrene measurement. The absence of styrene in the GC runs from 15 October cannot be interpreted as the yeast strain not working as the sample preparation was suboptimal and not validated with blanco cell material with exogenous styrene.

Aim Calculation of styrene production per amount of dry weight (DW) S. cerevisiae
Using peak area of the peak at the retention time of styrene (17,5min) and OD600 of cell cultures an estimate was made of the amount of styrene produced per DW.
Values:
- Kdw: 300mgDW/L/UnitOD600 is assumed as value obtained from the Molmic group.
- D: density of styrene: 0,909
- P: is peak area- peak area negative control
- Pref: is the peak area of 0,5% styrene
Formula:
styrene/DW(ug/mg)=((P/Pref)*0,5%*D*1.000.000)/(Kdw*OD600)
