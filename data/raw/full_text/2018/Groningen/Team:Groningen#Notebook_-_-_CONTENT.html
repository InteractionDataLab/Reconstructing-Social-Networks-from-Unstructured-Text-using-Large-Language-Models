Two runs were done. For the first run 0,1 molar styrene in ethyl acetate solution was injected to find out the retention time and test the Diode Array Detector.
            For the second run 0,5 ml ethylacetate, 0,5 ml lysed yeast cell culture and a drop 20 Âµl styrene were vortexed for 15 minutes. The apolar phase was then filtered over a 0,22 nm nylon membrane and injected into the HPLC system.  </P><P>The styrene only eluted at a high percentage of acetonitrile as is expected, looking at the log P of 2,7. Therefore another gradient mobile phase was chosen: water with methanol 0 - 100 %. As styrene eluted at a composition of 50 % water 50 % methanol it was chosen to validate a method with a gradient of 30 - 100 % methanol. The retention time of styrene in this run was 17,5 minutes.

This mixture was centrifuged at 5000g at 4Â°C for 20 minutes. Then the supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in ice cold water.

Furthermore, the phosphorylated cellulose dissolved in phosphate buffer, while cellulose was insoluble.

This band is not visible in PAL2(SB), suggesting the protein did not come to (as high) expression in the Stanford Brown strain. For EGII, the second wash is clean, suggesting most non-specific binding proteins have been washed from the beads. The elution fractions however contain multiple bands. EGII has an expected molecular weight of 44 kDa, but the bands on the gel show a larger sized protein. Hence we decided to perform an anti-His Western blot to detect the presence of a His-tagged protein.</P><P>The same protein samples were used for another SDS-PAGE gel (15%) and followed by a Western blot which was kindly performed by Dr. Aditya Iyer according to <A href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UMabJpKOg9ukW-qTmK0ZssQxaB19ZL_LgqrKfKlBn-U/edit" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UMabJpKOg9ukW-qTmK0ZssQxaB19ZL_LgqrKfKlBn-U/edit</A>. In this case, also a sample of the insoluble pellet fraction was loaded to see if there was any EGII presence (EGII(P)). The other samples are the same as described above.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><I>Western blot EGII. Order of the samples: ladder, EGII(P), EGII, SF, FT, W1, (empty lane), W2, EF1, EF2.

The results were analysed on the HPLC by Owen and Jeroen Nijland and by Benno on the GC-FID. </P><P>For cell lysis 200 Âµl worth of glass beads were added to 900 Âµl worth of liquid culture in a 1,5 ml Eppendorf cup. The Eppendorf was vortexed for 10 minutes and subsequently spun down at 13.000 rpm for 1 minute. 800 Âµl of the supernatant were used for the described GC sample preparation.</P><P>Liquid cultures of two promising PAL2 positive colonies were grown to OD , a negative control sample was also included.</P><P>Due to a miscommunication these supposedly superior samples originated from cells that were not supported with Phenylalanine in their grow medium.</P><P>The GC-FID results of all three measurements were negative. One potential explanation of this result is, that glass bead cell lysis is usually performed in 1 minute steps with 1 min ice cooling steps in between to prevent enzyme degradation. As enzymes are of no interest to our measurement this was skipped. During the 10 minutes of vortexing the movement of the glass beads could have risen the temperature of the contained liquid so much that styrene evaporated and left the Eppendorf immediately after opening.</P><P>The GC-FID runs therefore only give qualitative and not quantitative styrene measurement. The absence of styrene in the GC runs from 15 October cannot be interpreted as the yeast strain not working as the sample preparation was suboptimal and not validated with blanco cell material with exogenous styrene.</P><P><B>Who: Owen</B></P><P><B>Aim</B> Calculation of styrene production per amount of dry weight (DW) S. cerevisiae </P><P>Using peak area of the peak at the retention time of styrene (17,5min) and OD600 of cell cultures an estimate was made of the amount of styrene produced per DW.</P><P>Values: - Kdw: 300mgDW/L/UnitOD600 is assumed as value obtained from the Molmic group. - D: density of styrene: 0,909 - P: is peak area- peak area negative control - Pref: is the peak area of 0,5% styrene</P><P>Formula: styrene/DW(ug/mg)=((P/Pref)*0,5%*D*1.000.000)/(Kdw*OD600)</P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TH>OD600</TH><TH>Peak area (arbitrary units)</TH><TH>styrene/Dryweight cells (ug/mg)</TH></TR><TR><TD>negative control</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>2699</TD><TD>-</TD></TR><TR><TD>PAL2</TD><TD>4.2</TD><TD>20586</TD><TD>3.773894298</TD></TR><TR><TD>PAL2+</TD><TD>2.41</TD><TD>38628</TD><TD>13.21081475</TD></TR><TR><TD>PAL2++</TD><TD>0.38</TD><TD>26467</TD><TD>55.4256197</TD></TR><TR><TD>control + 0.5% styrene</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>1692738</TD><TD>-</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P><B>Who: Owen</B></P><P><B>Aim</B> Styrene detection in YPH499 with pRS313-Hxt7-PAL2+pYD1-CipA3-EGII+pRS425-CBHII-BGL1 and growth on cellobiose and phosphorylated cellulose </P><P>See <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Groningen/Protocols#HPLC-validation" target="_blank">HPLC styrene detection protocol</A>.
