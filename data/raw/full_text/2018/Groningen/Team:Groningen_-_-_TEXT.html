StyGreen,
manufacturing the greenest Lego Bricks!
StyGreen is bio-plastic produced out of recycled toilet paper.
Fossil fuels are depleting, and CO2 levels are rising:
The plastic production plays a significant role in this process.
Can we use recycled toilet paper to generate glucose?
Our Integrated   models say;
we can!
Letâ€™s design a yeast!
How would this look under a computational microscope ?
Large amounts of glucose, what can we do with it?
Give our yeast tools to create styrene, by knocking out unnecessary pathways.
Scale up to save the world!
Use StyGreen to build the greenest Lego Bricks!
We thank our sponsors:
