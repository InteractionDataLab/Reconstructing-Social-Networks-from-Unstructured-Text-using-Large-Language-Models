Experimental data suggests that cellulose gets degraded more effectively this way. Intuitively the scaffold  allows the yeast to more efficiently absorb the products of the degradation due to to proximity, but does scaffolding come at a cost? This model aims to simulate a scaffold similar to the one used in the lab mathematically, to see whether it suffers from any disadvantage and  whether the choice of cellulases make a difference. For comparison, a system of free enzymes was also modelled in a similar way.</P><H4>Method</H4><P>It is assumed that any advantage of scaffolding will also occur for a system of three cellulases. The model follows the degradation of cellulose chains by two enzymes, an exoglucanase and endoglucanase. To simplify the problem further, it is assumed that the cellulase chains are maximally 100 units long and are all completely soluble. This shouldn’t stop the model from working because cellulose is commercially available in soluble form and at short chain length distributions.</P><H4>Free Enzymes</H4><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TH>Symbol</TH><TH>Meaning</TH><TH>Unit</TH></TR><TR><TD>C<SUB>i</SUB></TD><TD>Concentration Of Cellulose chain of length i.</TD><TD>mmol/L</TD></TR><TR><TD>E<SUB>CBHI</SUB>, E<SUB>EG2</SUB></TD><TD>Concentration Of Enzymes Cellobiohydrolase and Endoglucanase</TD><TD>mmol/L</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P><I>Figure 1.

At times, the affinity of the Endoglucanase is higher than that of the Exoglucanase. According to the assumptions, the scaffold should benefit from the highest affinity ( lowest dissociation constant). To do this, the dissociation constant is allowed vary with the length of the corresponding chain by the equation in figure 8. This equation is a smooth approximation of the maximum of the affinities of both enzymes as a function of chain length. It had to be used because the mathematica solver cannot work with discontinuities.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><I>Figure 8.

In this model a scaffold was modelled using a system of differential equations. The performance of the scaffold on degrading cellulose chains was compared with that of free enzymes. The effect of varying the kCats between the constituent enzymes was also investigated. The results show that the scaffold performs overall a bit slower than the free enzymes. However, the difference isn't big enough to say that using a scaffold would cause a significant disadvantage in terms of reaction rate. The team could therefore use it and make use of the other advantages it offers, such as giving the yeast cell higher proximity to the products. Also, the scaffold will strongly benefit from the cellulose binding domain that MD simulations have found to give it a very large adsoprtion-affinity. Although beyond the scope of this project, this strong affinity of the binding domain could be assumed to increase the local concentration of cellulose, explaining the scaffold's high experimental speeds.
