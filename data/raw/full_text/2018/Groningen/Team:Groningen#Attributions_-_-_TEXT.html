“You give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. You teach him to fish and you give him an occupation that will feed him for a lifetime.” (Chinese proverb)
We, the University of Groningen iGEM team, were responsible for almost all aspects of StyGreen. From coming up with the concept, running a fully-functioning interdisciplinary team, finding supporters to finance our quest and executing, designing and running the wet- and dry lab work to name some. However, these past 6 months we have aimed to push ourselves beyond our personal limits. This page is dedicated to all those who helped us along the way. We want to thank you for your time, knowledge, patience, support and for believing in us!
