JUDGING FORM
in vitro eternal production of protein (iVEPOP)
In vivo circular RNA expression can be a cutting-edge method to perform mass-production of protein. During the translation of coding information of DNA into amino acids, the function of ribosomes is naturally influential. The translation is initiated by binding ribosomes to mRNA and, termination of translation is induced by stop codons. When a stop codon is recognized by ribosomes, the protein-producing organelles basically release the protein. To produce a large amount of protein or long-chain protein we can utilize circular RNA excluded the stop codons. iGEM Gifu 2015 performed the method of the Permuted Intron-Exon Method (PIE method). Currently, 2.5% of transcribed RNA can be formed as circular RNA using the method. In addition, with PIE method, mass-production of protein was confirmed in E.coli, however the protein had no function because of aggregation. This year our team tried to produce functional protein from the circular RNA in two types of cell-free kits, PURE system and myTXTL. In case of cell-free system, we can add optimal reagents from outside. To prevent aggregation and make it possible to have functional protein from circular RNA, we tried to divide the long-chain protein into monomer using TEV protease.
Bronze Medal Criteria
Register and attend
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Deliverables
Meet all deliverables on the Competition Deliverables page(section 4).
Attribution
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly designate work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.   Attributions
Characterization / Contribution
Participate in the Interlab Measurement Study and/or improve the characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information on that part's Main Page in the Registry. The part that you are characterizing must NOT be from a 2017 part number range.  Part Collection
Silver Medal Criteria
Validated Part / Validated Contribution
Convince the judges that at least one new BioBrick Part of your own design that is central to your project works as expected. Document the experimental characterization of this part on the Main Page of that Part’s Registry entry. Submit a sample of this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (following Registry submission guidelines). This working part must be different from the part documented in gold #2.
Collaboration
Convince the judges you have significantly worked with any other registered iGEM team in a meaningful way. For example, mentor a team, characterize a part, troubleshoot a project, model/simulate a system or validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem, or be the recipient of any of these activities.   Collaborations
Human Practices
Convince the judges you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your work is safe, responsible and good for the world. You could accomplish this through engaging with your local, national and/or international communities or other approaches. Please note that standard surveys will not fulfill this criteria.   Human Practices
Gold Medal Criteria
Integrated Human Practices
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.   Integrated Human Practices
Improve a previous part or project
Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part. The original part must NOT be from your 2017 part number range. If you change the original part sequence, you must submit a new part. In addition, both the new and original part pages must reference each other.
Model your project
Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling. Thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on your team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, and model results.
Demonstrate yout work
Convince the judges that your project works.
