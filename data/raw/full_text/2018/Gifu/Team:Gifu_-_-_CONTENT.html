During the translation of coding information of DNA into amino acids, the function of ribosomes is naturally influential. The translation is initiated by binding ribosomes to mRNA and, termination of translation is induced by stop codons. When a stop codon is recognized by ribosomes, the protein-producing organelles basically release the protein. To produce a large amount of protein or long-chain protein we can utilize circular RNA excluded the stop codons. iGEM Gifu 2015 performed the method of the Permuted Intron-Exon Method (PIE method). Currently, 2.5% of transcribed RNA can be formed as circular RNA using the method. In addition, with PIE method, mass-production of protein was confirmed in <I>E.coli</I>, however the protein had no function because of aggregation. This year our team tried to produce functional protein from the circular RNA in two types of cell-free kits, PURE system and myTXTL. In case of cell-free system, we can add optimal reagents from outside. To prevent aggregation and make it possible to have functional protein from circular RNA, we tried to divide the long-chain protein into monomer using TEV protease.</P><DIV id="ccc"><H2>Bronze Medal Criteria</H2><FONT>Register and attend</FONT><P>Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.</P><FONT>Deliverables</FONT><P>Meet all deliverables on the Competition Deliverables page(section 4).</P><FONT>Attribution</FONT><P>Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project.
