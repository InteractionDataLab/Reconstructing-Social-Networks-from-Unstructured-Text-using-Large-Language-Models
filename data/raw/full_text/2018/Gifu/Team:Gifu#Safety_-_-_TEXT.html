Safety
iGEM Gifu aim to the top-class of guarantee safety in the experiments. We often have a meeting with our teacher. We check and improve our safety in laboratory by the meeting. Graduate students（one-time our team member）take part in the meeting as advisers. So, we can receive advice by them. We discuss various things from basic things to the special things in a meeting. For example, Wearing a white robe, protector and gloves as needed, how to handle recombination, learning about Cartagena law（" Law Concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms"）and so on. This year Our PI and leader offered a special class of DNA recombination. All members took the class of DNA recombination ( Click here to download the safety manual ) . The leader is officially registered as an experimenter of DNA recombination in the university.  This year We used E. coli MG1655, DH5α, JM109. After constructing plasmids, we put them into the cell-free system. Protein expression in the cell-free system will be performed. E. coli will be used only to construct the plasmid. Thus, there was not any special risk of safety. Following the basic rules of the laboratory, there was no risks.
1.which whole organisms, including viruses, are you planning to use or using in your project?
Escherichia coli MG1655,DH5a,JM109
2. What risks could these organisms pose to you or your colleagues, or to your community or the environment if they escape the lab?
Following the basic rules of the laboratory, there is no risks. After constructing plasmids, we will put them into the cell-free system.
3. What risks could your chassis pose to you or your colleagues, or to your community or the environment if they escape the lab?
Basically no risks. Plasmids would be excluded from the cells after escaping the lab.
4. What experiments will you do with your organisms and parts?  What risks could arise from these experiments?
Protein expression in cell-free system will be performed. E.coli will be used to construct the plasmid only.No risks.
5. Imagine that your project was fully developed into a real product that real people could use. How would people use it?
Our project is foundational / we do not have a specific real-world application in mind
6. What safety, security or ethical risks would be involved with such a use?
No risks
7. Have your team members received any safety training?
Yes, we have already received safety and security training.
8. Which work areas do you use / are you using to handle biological materials?
Biosafety cabinet
9. How will the rules, training, containment and other procedures and practices help to manage any of the risks you identified in the last section?
With autoclaving all materials we are planning to use will be deactivated.
