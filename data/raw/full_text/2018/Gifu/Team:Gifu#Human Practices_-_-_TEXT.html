Collaboration research with Arbor Biosciences
We have a collaboration with Arbor Biosciences, a biotech company in the USA. They offered myTXTL, Arbor Biosciences' Cell-Free Protein Expression Kit (http://www.arborbiosci.com/products/mytxtl-cell-free-protein-expression/) to us. Dr. Evelyn, Product Development Scientist, suggested us that we should try to evaluate the difference of the efficiency of PIE method and protein expression from the circular RNA between PURE system and myTXTL because the kits are made in different methods. We tried to make a comparison using SDS-PAGE. You can see our results here. Not only as a sponsor, but also an advisor, Arbor Biosciences gave us a good effect. With their idea. We could make our project much more interesting. Thank you so much.

The team at Arbor Biosciences prides themselves on providing exceptional customer service and timely technical support to new or advanced users on our array of products. We routinely collaborate with our customers and research partners to develop innovative solutions to address their unique applications. From discussing the feasibility of a project to providing fast, reliable laboratory services, we are here to help. We welcome the opportunity to collaborate and develop a custom solution for your unique research question.
Meeting with specialists
We had a discussion with Dr.Ebihara (Research field: Enzymology) and Dr.Nakagawa (research field: Molecular cell biology) who are Department of Applied Life Science, Faculty of Applied Biological Sciences, Gifu University. They study biological control mechanism occurred by Renin-Angiotensin system, a blood pressure control mechanism in a point of biochemistry. During the discussion, they advised us using TEV protease to prevent the generated protein from aggregation and trying to decrease the incubate temperature because the rate of folding of protein can be lower. In addition, we learned about cloning technique from them. Thank you so much for the practical advice.
