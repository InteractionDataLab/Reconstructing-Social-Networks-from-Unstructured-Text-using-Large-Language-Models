We often have a meeting with our teacher. We check and improve our safety in laboratory by the meeting. Graduate students（one-time our team member）take part in the meeting as advisers. So, we can receive advice by them. We discuss various things from basic things to the special things in a meeting. For example, Wearing a white robe, protector and gloves as needed, how to handle recombination, learning about Cartagena law（&quot; Law Concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms&quot;）and so on. This year Our PI and leader offered a special class of DNA recombination. All members took the class of DNA recombination ( <A href="http://www.abios.gifu-u.ac.jp/h1884/file/3b07682dbbb16a724cc6f72715726718.pdf">Click here to download the safety manual</A> )
. The leader is officially registered as an experimenter of DNA recombination in the university.  This year We used <I>E. coli</I> MG1655, DH5α, JM109. After constructing plasmids, we put them into the cell-free system. Protein expression in the cell-free system will be performed. <I>E. coli</I> will be used only to construct the plasmid. Thus, there was not any special risk of safety. Following the basic rules of the laboratory, there was no risks.</P><DIV class="form"><H3>1.which whole organisms, including viruses, are you planning to use or using in your project?</H3><P><I>Escherichia coli</I> MG1655,DH5a,JM109</P><H3>2. What risks could these organisms pose to you or your colleagues, or to your community or the environment if they escape the lab?</H3><P>Following the basic rules of the laboratory, there is no risks. After constructing plasmids, we will put them into the cell-free system.</P><H3>3. What risks could your chassis pose to you or your colleagues, or to your community or the environment if they escape the lab?</H3><P>Basically no risks. Plasmids would be excluded from the cells after escaping the lab.</P><H3>4. What experiments will you do with your organisms and parts?　 What risks could arise from these experiments?</H3><P>Protein expression in cell-free system will be performed. <I>E.coli</I> will be used to construct the plasmid only.No risks.</P><H3>5. Imagine that your project was fully developed into a real product that real people could use. How would people use it?</H3><P>Our project is foundational / we do not have a specific real-world application in mind </P><H3>6. What safety, security or ethical risks would be involved with such a use?</H3><P>No risks</P><H3>7. Have your team members received any safety training?</H3><P>Yes, we have already received safety and security training.</P><H3>8. Which work areas do you use / are you using to handle biological materials?</H3><P>Biosafety cabinet</P><H3>9. How will the rules, training, containment and other procedures and practices help to manage any of the risks you identified in the last section?</H3><P>With autoclaving all materials we are planning to use will be deactivated.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
