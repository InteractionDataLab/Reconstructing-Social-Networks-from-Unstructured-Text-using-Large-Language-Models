The presentation consisted of genetic recombination technology, synthesize biology and genome editing. The purpose of the visit was to make high school students interested in our activity and help develop synthetic biology. At this lecture, we especially told them the system of genome editing (CRISPR) and how great it is. Many students asked about iGEM and biobricks at the lecture. We believe that understanding the cutting-edge technology and real research can be a good opportunity to think of their future for high school students who would like to be scientists. After the class, we got some questions from students. It was also a good opportunity for us to consider“what education of synthetic biology should be given to students” deeply.
</P><H1>Making YouTube channel for junior high school students</H1><P>We made a YouTube channel for junior high school students to tell them about biology and chemistry. Our purpose of making channel is to make them interested in iGEM and biology. We have already uploaded six videos of doing PCR, acid-base titration and so on. As a startup of thinking of science, our videos are completely awesome. Through this activity, we hope many people know what iGEM is. Anyway, would you like to subscribe our YouTube channel？</P><P>Our channel’s URL: <A href="“https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZtpJB6T3GIwAabxtCcfahA”" target="_blank">“https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZtpJB6T3GIwAabxtCcfahA”</A>.</P><P>We are going to keep uploading videos to our channel for a while.</P><H1>Presentation in Kagami reunion</H1><P>Our team can do iGEM activities thanks to Kagami Reunion’s economic support. Kagami reunion is the people who are older our university’s graduates and much more experienced in the field of agricultural chemistry. We have been supported by them since we started to participate in the iGEM. However, we couldn’t meet them directly at all. On June 2nd, we got a chance to meet them by our professor’s special grace. So, we were able to convey our gratitude for their support by giving a presentation about our activity report of last year. After the presentation, they gave us precious advice and encouraging words. We were so glad to have their words because they had been active in the field of agricultural chemistry and are professionals.</P><H1>Having a booth in OPEN CAMPUS of Gifu University</H1><P>We got a chance to introduce iGEM Gifu’s activity at the open campus of Gifu University held from August 9th to August 10th. Many high school students visited our booth. We talked about iGEM, synthetic biology and university life to the public. Our members, mainly from freshmen, were in charge of the booth. We showed two posters about iGEM and university life to visitors. After the poster session, lots of students showed the deep interest toward iGEM and the mystery of synthetic biology. The talk with high school student was apparently a good experience for us too. We hope that they will join iGEM Gifu in the near future.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
