They offered myTXTL, Arbor Biosciences' Cell-Free Protein Expression Kit (http://www.arborbiosci.com/products/mytxtl-cell-free-protein-expression/) to us. Dr. Evelyn, Product Development Scientist, suggested us that we should try to evaluate the difference of the efficiency of PIE method and protein expression from the circular RNA between PURE system and myTXTL because the kits are made in different methods. We tried to make a comparison using SDS-PAGE. You can see our results here. Not only as a sponsor, but also an advisor, Arbor Biosciences gave us a good effect. With their idea. We could make our project much more interesting. Thank you so much.</P><H3>Introduction of <A href="https://arborbiosci.com">Arbor Biosciences</A></H3><P>Arbor Biosciences is a development and manufacturing company owned by scientists founded to serve our peers in molecular biology applications. We are a passionate organization of scientists determined to deliver cost-effective, user-friendly products to researchers of genetics and synthetic biology. The team at Arbor Biosciences prides themselves on providing exceptional customer service and timely technical support to new or advanced users on our array of products. We routinely collaborate with our customers and research partners to develop innovative solutions to address their unique applications. From discussing the feasibility of a project to providing fast, reliable laboratory services, we are here to help. We welcome the opportunity to collaborate and develop a custom solution for your unique research question.</P><H1>Meeting with specialists</H1><P>We had a discussion with Dr.Ebihara (Research field: Enzymology) and Dr.Nakagawa (research field: Molecular cell biology) who are Department of Applied Life Science, Faculty of Applied Biological Sciences, Gifu University. They study biological control mechanism occurred by Renin-Angiotensin system, a blood pressure control mechanism in a point of biochemistry. During the discussion, they advised us using TEV protease to prevent the generated protein from aggregation and trying to decrease the incubate temperature because the rate of folding of protein can be lower. In addition, we learned about cloning technique from them. Thank you so much for the practical advice. </P><P>*The picture shows the leader of the team and Prof.Nakagawa</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
