Ryo NIWA, a leader of our team went to Kyoto as a representative of team Gifu. We discussed the progress of the projects and some iGEM regulations. At that time, iGEM Kyoto provided us with KELN, a software which automatically translates a lab notebook into HTML. With the system, we made a calendar and some tables of components of media for cell growth. In return, we offered feedback to team Kyoto about software KELN. Even though you don’t know about HTML, you can use KELN and make some figures for wikis. It is completely workable for anyone and highly recommended to use. Thank you to iGEM Kyoto and Dr. Woltjen, secondary PI of the team.</P><P><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Kyoto/Collaborations">Click here to see the wiki of iGEM Kyoto</A></P><P><A href="https://github.com/iGEMKyoto/KELN/wiki">Download KELN</A></P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><H1>iGEM NJU-China</H1><P>One of our members visited Nanjing university on August 26, 2018. Our team leader sent the file of the project before the discussion. We had a small discussion regarding each project. Also, iGEM NJU-China held a lab tour to consider the lab rules for the safety.
 Our member was given an explanation about how to use their laboratory instruments safely during the tour. They also offered some talks about their project. During the past few years, NJU-China focused on the ligand-receptor system targeting certain tissues or cells with the exosome containing siRNAs as a new therapy towards certain disorders. This year, they found a more specific element targeting the subcellular structure, dendrites of neurons. The element comes from the 5’-UTR (untranslated region) of a lentivirus, and they made several tests to find the most suitable package of the element.

Gifu, Bochan Lab., KAIT Japan, Tokyo-Tech and ASIJ (High School team) got together, and each team gave presentations about our provisional projects and team management. After that, we exchanged opinions and gave some advice to each other. For example, we asked why they chose that method of experiments. We also discussed the future work of projects for the coming Giant Jamboree. We were inspired a lot by knowing innovative research projects and views of other teams.

They introduced us their project showing us a PDF file (<A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Botchan_Lab_Tokyo/Collaborations">Go to the wiki page of iGEM Botchan Lab Toyko</A>). We also sent some documents regarding our project back to them. (<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2018/f/fa/T--Gifu--Gifu_abstract.pdf">Click here to download our PDF</A>) Their project may lead to a solution of food crisis from the viewpoint of Nitrogen fixation. They said that if <I>E.coli</I> can synthesize amino acid by taking in nitrogen gas from the air as a part of our intestinal flora, malnutrition can be solved much easier. Considering this project, we offered a scientific article written by our PI, Prof. Iwahashi. Since he used to research nitrogen fixation before. They also taught us the methods of cloning. They constructed really large plasmids and we asked for the advice from them. Sadly, we could not make them this year but still, it was totally helpful for us.

Their application is increasingly popular in synthetic biology where they allow fast iteration of design-build-test cycles of genetic parts and gene circuits. Now is the time to prepare for the widespread adoption of cell-free methods by iGEM teams. </P><P>With this concept, iGEM Paris Bettencourt planned to have a pilot-scale interlab to test the variation of cell-free expression systems between labs. Then Dr.Evelyn from Arbor Biosciences connected us to Paris Bettencourt team. Thus we had a Skype meeting and our team decided to join the collaboration. You can download the PDF which shows the result of our collaborative research below.
