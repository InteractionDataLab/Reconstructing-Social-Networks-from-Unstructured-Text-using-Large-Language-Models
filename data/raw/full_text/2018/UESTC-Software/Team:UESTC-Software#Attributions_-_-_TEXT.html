Our Member
Team Leader
Ruijia Liu and Haotian Zhang are our team leaders. They coordinate the work of the whole team and push the project forward. Meanwhile, Ruijia Liu was responsible for the communication between our team and other teams and companies, and Haotian Zhang was responsible for adding keywords to the biobricks in BioMaster.
Database
Keyu Wu, Zhiguo Chen, Fengjiang Liu and Weihang Wu are mainly responsible for constructing database, BioMaster. They integrate 9 databases with the iGEM registry to expand information of biobricks. They have collected information of biobricks including interactions, functions, sites, components, feature key and references, making BioMaster an enormous, comprehensive and intuitive data source of biobricks.
Prediction
Hao Xu, Zhixi Yun, Bohan Li, Ruizhi Yuan are mainly responsible for promoter prediction. They use algorithm based on Python and MATLAB to build models to do some predictions. They created a database which provides results of predicted promoters for synthetic biologists. Different methods are provided for different species and users can choose based on their own needs.
Human Practice
Wenxiang Tan, Qingyu Zheng and Xikai Tang are mainly responsible for Human Practice. They designed board game Bio-Chess and had a bunch of interesting activities to promote synthetic biology. Besides, they do some surveys and some questionnaires for iGEM teams and professors about the problems they encountered and their needs. Meanwhile, they visit bio-technology companies and institutes to improve and enhance our own project.
Art Designers
Huiyuan Li and Rui Yao are mainly responsible for are design. They were in charge of the planning of Bio-Chess, posters and PPTs for the Southwest Alliance meeting and CCiC and the design of the page design and illustrations of wiki and posters.
Bio-Chess developer
Zhixi Yun developed the online version of Bio-Chess and the art design of the game. He is fully in charge of creating this game.
