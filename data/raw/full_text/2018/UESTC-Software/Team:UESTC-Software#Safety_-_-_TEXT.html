Safety with BioMaster
BioMaster is a biobrick database which focuses on database integration as well as promoter prediction. The data in the BioMaster comes from databases with security certifications and declarations such as Uniprot and EPD, so the data in BioMaster is also secure. Our prediction function is only meant to provide users with a prediction result for their reference. Whether to use it depends on users’ actual situation and their own judges.
Q1: What are the functions of BioMaster?
A1: BioMaster can be used to search for detailed information of biobricks such as its functions, sites, interactions and related references. It can predict if a DNA sequence is a promoter.
Q2: How BioMaster works?
A2: BioMaster is run and maintained by UESTC. Users can use it by visit our website.
Q3:Who are the users of BioMaster?
A3: Users are those who want to find information about biobricks or those who want to do some promoter prediction.
Q4: Does it have any risks in laboratory?
A4: BioMaster runs as a web page. It aims to provide more detailed and comprehensive biobrick information and accurate prediction results of promoters to synthetic biologists. We won’t use any plasmid or bacteria. No wet-lab experiments and no pollution to the environment.
Q5: Is it risky for users to use BioMaster?
A5: BioMaster runs on a computer so it does no harm to the environment and users’ health. By visiting our web page people can use BioMaster. They don’t even have to login. With no information entry, User's privacy will not be risk of disclosure.
Q6: Does BioMaster infringe on the intellectual property of others?
We specifically consulted lawyer Mr. Yong’gang Zheng on intellectual property issues. The databases referenced by BioMaster are all open source, and these databases have no related statements. So, our work is reasonable and legal. We will also explain which databases BioMaster refers to. In addition, BioMaster provides links only to the literature, which can be opened directly on the relevant websites and do not constitute infringement.
Q7: Does BioMaster need to be responsible for the user's actions?
A7: BioMaster is free to use, which means that there is no interest dispute with the user. Users should adhere to the principle of voluntariness when using. So even bad result comes due to the software, we are not responsible for that.
Safety with Bio-Chess
The PC version of the Bio-Chess has the same rules as the physical version. Users need to download the software to use it. We uploaded the game to the network platform. The game has passed the security check so users can be assured to use it.
Q1: Where can it be used? Will it cause environmental pollution?
A1: Users only have to download it to their own computer to play the game. Bio-Chess can only be run on a computer so it will not cause environmental pollution.
Q2: Who will use the PC version of Bio-Chess?
A2: Our target players are anyone interested in synthetic biology. Teachers and parents can use it to inspire children's interest in synthetic biology.
Q3: Will it harm the privacy of users?
A3: The game doesn’t require login so it doesn’t collect users’ personal information. It causes no harm to users’ privacy.
