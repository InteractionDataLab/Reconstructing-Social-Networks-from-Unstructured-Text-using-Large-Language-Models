One is to improve our own project. Another is to promote us, iGEM and synthetic biology to the public. Our integrated Human Practices will mainly talk about how HP affects the project. And in our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:UESTC-Software/Public_Engagement"><EM>Education&amp; Public Engagement</EM></A>, you will find more about how we let people engage synthetic biology.</P><H1 id="hp">Integrated HP</H1><P>At the beginning of the competition, we decided to construct the integrated biobrick database. Because of the specialty of the project, our main users will be iGEMers and synthetic biologists. Then we thought carefully about how to make sure our project would work well and meet the needs of those who conduct synthetic biological experiments. So, we created a complete ‘investigation-improve-test-feedback’ framework with 7 steps and 2 rounds of tests and feedback to improve our project. Then we did our human practices in correspondence to every step of this circle.</P><P>Here’s the 7-step circle. You can click the fellow bottons to straightly see any step you want to know or you can read it step by step.</P><H2 id="hp_1" style="background-color:#cbce5d">Problems and Idea</H2><P>First, we encountered the problems when using iGEM Registry to conduct experiments and we came up with the idea of constructing this BioMaster database to solve the problem.</P><H2 id="hp_2" style="background-color: #eec621">Preliminary Investigation</H2><P>Then, preliminary investigation is essential which will be our directions for the first construction. We did some surveys and questionnaires for nearly 100 participated iGEMers or professors about the problems they met when doing synthetic biological experiments. Of course, we analyzed what we investigated. What’s more, not only online research but we communicated with different teams face to face for their opinions and their needs for a new biobrick database. Also, we consulted a lawyer for the rights of using other databases in case we violated some regulations. </P><H3>Questionnaires and Analysis</H3><P>Before the start of our project, we need to know clearly what problems we are facing and what our users’ needs are. Only in this way will we make sure that our project is adaptable and user-friendly. We designed an online questionnaire ‘Investigation of situation about the use of iGEM parts’ and spread it to over 16 districts and nearly 100 iGEMers and synthetic biologists. </P><P>Of course, questionnaire cannot live without analysis. We spent some time analyzing the results and used the method of binary-crossover analysis. Surprised results were found and it inspired us for the next step.</P><DIV class="hpxl hpxl_1 row"><DIV class="col-lg-11  col-md-11  col-sm-11"><H3>Our analysis results</H3><DIV class="xl_con"><P>We used binary-crossover analysis to the question ‘How do you feel about searching information in iGEM Registry? ’ and ‘What difficulties or problems you would encounter when constructing a gene circuit? ’. The former is the independent variable X and the latter is the dependent variable Y. Through this method, we were surprised to get a message that was easily ignored before. From the initial statistical results, the ratio of option A ‘I don't know which part to use’ is the smallest. However, after analysis, we could see that most dissatisfied people chose ’I don’t know which part to use’. In other words, in our project we should focuses more on this issue. According to this, we are more determined to added more accurate information to the database as much as possible. </P><P id="mingming">Fig.1.Satisfaction</P><P id="mingming">Fig.2.Cross analysis table</P><P id="mingming">Fig.3.Cross analysis chart</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><H3>A visit with iGEM team</H3><P>We went to UESTC-China and communicated with them about their opinions. First, we asked the problems they may want to avoid and what they think is a user-friendly database. Their opinions are important for us to design the database.</P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="talk col-lg-11">
