Description
As population increases, the demand for housing is soaring. Apparently, the newly fitted houses contain furnitures that produce large amount of formaldehyde, which is a toxic gas. The inhalation of formaldehyde, even by a small amount, may cause nausea, and headache. Excess inhalation of formaldehyde may cause asthma. Our project aims to create a engineering bacteria through genetic engineering; the deployment of such product in environment that contains formaldehyde may help purify the air. We are going to introduce exogenous genetic—fluorescent protein gene and Gfa or PHi, Phs gene—to make the modified E.coli to emit fluorescent when the formaldehyde concentration in the environment reaches a certain level, and to continuously degrade the aldehyde, purifying the air. Such engineering bacteria, when being used, cost relatively little, and is able to detect formaldehyde. These are the advantages which formaldehyde-absorbing plants do not have.
Timeline
February 26, 2018. Team Members and advisors had discussion online about project design and expectations for the upcoming months.
March 10, 2018. Team Members meet face to face for the first time at BGI College. Over the weekend, we decided the direction of our project.
From March 10 to May 22, 2018, we read research papers, performed surveys in local communities, and research online, about relative informations about formaldehyde and formaldehyde removal products.
May 23, 2018, we had group phone call online with TU Delft, to discuss details of our collaborations in the Eurasian Meet-Up in the summer.
June 26, 2018, start of experiments.
July 24, 25, 26, hosted the Eurasian Meet-Up with TU Delft in Shenzhen. It was a great event for teams to share their progresses by then and find new connections with other teams.
August 17, 2018 finished and passed interlab

Advice on writing your Project Description
We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be concise, accurate, and unambiguous in your achievements.
References
iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you thought about your project and what works inspired you.
