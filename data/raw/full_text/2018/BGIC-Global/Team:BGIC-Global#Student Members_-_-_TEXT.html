Sherry Wang
Hello! I’m Sherry Wang, leader of our best BGIC-Global! It’s a great pleasure to take part in this competition. I have a great number of hobbies, such as animation, singing, drawing, playing badminton, and especially biology. iGEM attracts me because it’s a world-class competition, which means I will meet so many different people from different countries. Also, I like the feeling of working on a program with friends. It’s fantastic for us to discuss, doing research, and finally achieve something. So, LET’S ENJOY IT!
Jack Yan
Hello!I am Yan Zhenhao ,the leader of experimental team.My hobbies are biology, sports and reading.I want to join in this competition because, firstly, I am interested in biology and want to choose major in this field. Also, i want to expand my knowledge of experiment and molecular biology. In addition, I'd love to learn in the world-wide range.
Amy Zhang
Hello! I am Qinming , one of the leader of human practice team, and my English name is Amy. I like playing the piano, playing field hockey and ice hockey. I also like to compose some music whenever I have free time. The reason I attended IGEM competition is because I want to pursue my passion in biology in the future, and IGEM is a platform for me to widen my horizon of this field and become an independent and critical thinker of biology. This is my first time doing project on synthetic biology, so I would like to accept this challenge. My role on this team is the Human Practice captain. I enjoy being a member in BGIC-Global and I have faith that we will get good results for the final Giant Jamboree!
Jerry Cheng
Hello!I am Jerry Cheng, one of the leader of human practice team.Hobbies are Golf,Clarinet Basketball, Frisbee and Fitness   I like iGEM not only because of bio-engineering, but also because it is a competition that is interdisciplinary. Things such as creating wiki, finding sponsors, and collaborating with other teams require more than knowledge in biology. That is to say, iGEM not only helps me enlarge my knowledge on bio-engineering, but also helps me improve my interpersonal skills, which are the skills I need to survive in the future. iGEM allows me to demonstrate my communication skills as well as leadership.
Adam Lang
Hello!I am Yusen Lang.On the team I work with the experiment team and also the wiki team. I try to do as much as I can to help the team improve and achieve our goals. Other than biology, I like basketball, analytics, and journalism. I enjoy iGEM because of the synthetic biology knowledge that I m able to obtain, and more importantly, the people that I m able to meet and learn from. I like seeing ideas be realized iGEM provides an opportunity for me to accomplish this goal.
Jason Liang
My name is Jason Liang, a member of experiment group in BGIC-Global.I come from Shenzhen senior high school international division.In my spare time,I always do some research about medicine and synthetic biology both of which my two favorite subjects.I also work as a social worker at the weekend ,including doing some voluntary work to help the sick children in the hospital, fighting for the rights of HIV carriers. Thus,I can also help human practice group with their job.I took part in IGEM not only because I am really interested in synthetic biology but also because I really want to improve my communication skills and dedication spirit.

Jason Liu
I am Xiaoyi Liu (‘Jason’), and I have a strong interest in synthetic biology, history and social sciences. I spend my free time swimming, reading, and developing useful skills such as making 3D or mathematic models, writing, and painting. I highly value explication, placidity, and logic.
Leo Lao
Hello! I am Leo Lao, a member of BGIC-Global. As a junior in a US boarding school, my academic life is stressful, but I still joined this competition, because it is a great chance to practice out things that I learned in books and more. I found my interested in bio more than 10 years ago, which was initially just a curiosity of how life works. It is lucky, that I found  a clear goal in my life before stepping into college. I'm resoluted about the goal, so the only problem here is to find a path, and I think IGEM will be the first step of many.
Leo Liu
Hello! My name is Leo Liu, and I am an experimental group member from BGI-College’s IGEM team. I have a passion in science. My innate curiosity pushes me into researching and experimenting while understanding the rules and philosophies behind nature laws. I love biology and has conducted research on my own and as assistances. I am also a big fan of sports and music because I believe that these programs can help me have a clearer and deeper understanding on events happening around us and in the world. I hope I can blend well and make a positive impact on the team!
