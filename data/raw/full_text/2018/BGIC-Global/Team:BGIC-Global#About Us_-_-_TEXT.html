Hello dear iGEMers! This is the team BGIC-Global from BGI College in China. We are a group of ten high school students who are from different parts of the world with specialities in biological experiments, commercial popularizing, mathematical modeling, public speaking, and even arts and design. Since the middle of March, we have formed our team with two main departments, which are experiment group and human practice group. Our aim is to make our project responsible and beneficial for the society. During this "adventure", the ideas of synthetic biology and genetic engineering are put into practice. Additionally, the valuable experience contributes a lot to the growth of every team member.
