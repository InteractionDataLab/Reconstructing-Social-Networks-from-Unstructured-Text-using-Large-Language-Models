Team Members
Hello! I’m Sherry Wang, leader of our best BGIC-Global! It’s a great pleasure to take part in this competition. I have a great number of hobbies, such as animation, singing, drawing, playing badminton, and especially biology. iGEM attracts me because it’s a world-class competition, which means I will meet so many different people from different countries. Also, I like the feeling of working on a program with friends. It’s fantastic for us to discuss, doing research, and finally achieve something. So, LET’S ENJOY IT!
Hello!I am Yan Zhenhao ,the leader of experimental team.My hobbies are biology, sports and reading.I want to join in this competition because, firstly, I am interested in biology and want to choose major in this field. Also, i want to expand my knowledge of experiment and molecular biology. In addition, I'd love to learn in the world-wide range.
Hello! I am Qinming , one of the leader of human practice team, and my English name is Amy. I like playing the piano, playing field hockey and ice hockey. I also like to compose some music whenever I have free time. The reason I attended IGEM competition is because I want to pursue my passion in biology in the future, and IGEM is a platform for me to widen my horizon of this field and become an independent and critical thinker of biology. This is my first time doing project on synthetic biology, so I would like to accept this challenge. My role on this team is the Human Practice captain. I enjoy being a member in BGIC-Global and I have faith that we will get good results for the final Giant Jamboree!
Hello!I am Jerry Chen, one of the leader of human practice team.Hobbies are Golf,Clarinet Basketball, Frisbee and Fitness   I like iGEM not only because of bio-engineering, but also because it is a competition that is interdisciplinary. Things such as creating wiki, finding sponsors, and collaborating with other teams require more than knowledge in biology. That is to say, iGEM not only helps me enlarge my knowledge on bio-engineering, but also helps me improve my interpersonal skills, which are the skills I need to survive in the future. iGEM allows me to demonstrate my communication skills as well as leadership.
Hello!I am Yusen Lang.On the team I work with the experiment team and also the wiki team. I try to do as much as I can to help the team improve and achieve our goals. Other than biology, I like basketball, analytics, and journalism. I enjoy iGEM because of the synthetic biology knowledge that I m able to obtain, and more importantly, the people that I m able to meet and learn from. I like seeing ideas be realized iGEM provides an opportunity for me to accomplish this goal.
My name is Jason Liang, a member of experiment group in BGIC-Global.I come from Shenzhen senior high school international division.In my spare time,I always do some research about medicine and synthetic biology both of which my two favorite subjects.I also work as a social worker at the weekend ,including doing some voluntary work to help the sick children in the hospital, fighting for the rights of HIV carriers. Thus,I can also help human practice group with their job.I took part in IGEM not only because I am really interested in synthetic biology but also because I really want to improve my communication skills and dedication spirit.
I’m qiu wenan ,a member of  experimental group.I’m 16 years old ,and I live in Shenzhen,China. I like playing football and badminton in my spare time.I join this program not only because I want to improve my teamwork’s skill, but also for the reason that I’m interested in experiments.
I am Xiaoyi Liu (‘Jason’), and I have a strong interest in synthetic biology, history and social sciences. I spend my free time swimming, reading, and developing useful skills such as making 3D or mathematic models, writing, and painting. I highly value explication, placidity, and logic.
Hello! My name is Leo Liu, and I am an experimental group member from BGI-College’s IGEM team. I have a passion in science. My innate curiosity pushes me into researching and experimenting while understanding the rules and philosophies behind nature laws. I love biology and has conducted research on my own and as assistances. I am also a big fan of sports and music because I believe that these programs can help me have a clearer and deeper understanding on events happening around us and in the world. I hope I can blend well and make a positive impact on the team!
Instructors
Hello! I am Dorothy Zhang, the director of Science Education, BGI College. I have assisted and led the establishment and operation of several NGOs that focus on the exchanging and popularization of life sciences. With a background of psychology, I am now working on bridging the gap between folks without much biology background, especially the young students, and the most advanced research & technology development.
Hello I am Wu Yi, a team advisor in BGIC-Global.I am responsible for the experiment guidance with my partners including the experiment skills and design guidance. We provide experiment skills training and help students to carry out the project.   Badminton and jogging are my favorite sports and I also enjoy watching tennis and ping-pong matches. In my spare time I like listen to the music and my idol is David Garrett, a violinist. And I am now saving money for his live show ticket.
Hello!I am Wenchen,Song. As an instructor of BGI-Global, I work in Infection Omics Research Institute, BGI-Research. My research focuses on bioinformatics and synthetic biology, exploring the influence of bacteriophage in microbial and human health. And I believe that “what I cannot create, I don’t understand –Richard Feynman”. What’s more, synthetic biology will benefit mankind in the future, which is that I hope my team to make sense of. In BGIC-Global, I have seen their growth and dedication, so I take pride in them. BGIC-Global, fighting!
I am Li Cheng, the instructor of BGI-Global. First of all, I am very happy to be the instructor of this diverse team. During this time, there will always be unexpected inspirations when you come into contact with these interesting and active students. They are full of curiosity and exploration. Besides, they have jump thinking, and a steady stream of ideas. In addition, this is a friendly team. In the course of the experiment, when faced with difficulties, they will encourage each other. In short, this is an excellent team of high school students. Of course, their further growth cannot be separated from your valuable opinions. I hope everyone can support them a lot. Thanks!
