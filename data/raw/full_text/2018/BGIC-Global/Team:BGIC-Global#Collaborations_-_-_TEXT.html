TU Delft iGEM
Partnership Program
We did not only organize the Eurasian Meetup with TU Delft iGEM team, but also we collaborated with them through the Partnership Program. As we are participating in iGEM for the first time, we went over their bios and chose our favorite partners. For example, one of the Human Practice captains in our team chose the Human Practice manager in TU Delft team. During the program, the Human Practice manager in TU Delft gave us some advice on how to extend and advertise our product by sending out posters or messages on social media. We also helped them by translating their gene-doping surveys in Chinese so that they could gain more responses. Overall, they gained 130 responses in China.
Bio-Safety Video
Two members--Alexander Armstrong (TU Delft) and Jerry Cheng (BGIC-GLOBAL) worked together and created a biosafety video, which incorporated interviews of participants at the meetup, as well as expert's opinions/attitudes on biosafety and bioethics.
Fujian Normal University (FJNU-China)
After our project presentation during the Eurasian Meetup, we received some advice about the design of our final product. Due to our goal of family-used terminal product, smelling of E.coli should considered as a problem need to be eliminated. Luckily, we found FJNU-China, whose project is aiming to produce a kind of E.coli that emits rose smelling and who have tasteless tnaa E.coli that is knocked out its smelly gene. Meanwhile, FJNU-China expressed their needs for sequence analysis from GBI. As a result, we build up a collaboration with each other. FJNU-China will send us the tasteless E.coli, and we will help them analyze sequence provided by them.
Conference
This year, besides Eurasian Meetup, our team has participated other two conferences: CCiC in Shanghai and Bluepha Conference in Shenzhen.
CCiC
From September 28th to 31st, we participated in the fifth CCiC held in Shanghai, China. It was a great experience for us to share and learn with dozens of other Chinese IGEM teams. We recieved many helpful feedback of our prototype shown in our presentation, which helps us to refine the performance and safety of our final product.
Bluepha Conference
Basic information
Date: 2018.6.24
Address: Qinghua Information Port, Shenzhen Guangdong
Number of teams attending the conference: 6
In this conference, we firstly presented the whole idea about our experimental design and concluded all the investigation we did until then. Nevertheless, although the principle was already clear, we had no concept about our product design, which means that we did not consider how to maintain the efficiency to process formaldehyde, ensure that the E.coli is safe to human, and dispose the dead E.coli without polluting the environment. Under the help of tutor from Bluepha, we got several useful suggestions. First, it is necessary to design an experiment test the efficiency of our product as well as how long it works. Second, to consider how to design the container of our product to separate E.coli from users is better than to consider if the product is safe enough to touch.
