Dorothy Zhang
Hello! I am Dorothy Zhang, the director of Science Education, BGI College. I have assisted and led the establishment and operation of several NGOs that focus on the exchanging and popularization of life sciences. With a background of psychology, I am now working on bridging the gap between folks without much biology background, especially the young students, and the most advanced research & technology development.
Yi Wu
Hello I am Yi Wu, a team advisor in BGIC-Global.I am responsible for the experiment guidance with my partners including the experiment skills and design guidance. We provide experiment skills training and help students to carry out the project.   Badminton and jogging are my favorite sports and I also enjoy watching tennis and ping-pong matches. In my spare time I like listen to the music and my idol is David Garrett, a violinist. And I am now saving money for his live show ticket.
Wenchen Song
Hello!I am Wenchen Song. As an instructor of BGI-Global, I work in Infection Omics Research Institute, BGI-Research. My research focuses on bioinformatics and synthetic biology, exploring the influence of bacteriophage in microbial and human health. And I believe that “what I cannot create, I don’t understand –Richard Feynman”. What’s more, synthetic biology will benefit mankind in the future, which is that I hope my team to make sense of. In BGIC-Global, I have seen their growth and dedication, so I take pride in them. BGIC-Global, fighting!

I am Li Cheng, the instructor of BGI-Global. First of all, I am very happy to be the instructor of this diverse team. During this time, there will always be unexpected inspirations when you come into contact with these interesting and active students. They are full of curiosity and exploration. Besides, they have jump thinking, and a steady stream of ideas. In addition, this is a friendly team. In the course of the experiment, when faced with difficulties, they will encourage each other. In short, this is an excellent team of high school students. Of course, their further growth cannot be separated from your valuable opinions. I hope everyone can support them a lot. Thanks!
