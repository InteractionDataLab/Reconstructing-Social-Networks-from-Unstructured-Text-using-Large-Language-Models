Description
We aim to make engineered bacteria which can be able to detect and decompose formaldehyde. BBa_K2728003 is the part that allows bacteria to show their detection of formaldehyde by emitting fluorescence. BBA_K2728001 can retain responsiveness of formaldehyde and allow fluorescence gene, BBa_K2728003, to express more strongly. BBa_K2728004 can build up intrinsic pathway inside bacteria and make them decomposing formaldehyde into formic acid. Our parts can work together and fulfill our goal of detecting and decomposing formaldehyde.
Our part numbers represent the names on the picture in the following way:
1. BBa_K2728001: pfrmR
2. BBa_K2728003: Nluc
3. BBa_K2728004: GFA
As the graph shows, BBa_K2728001, as an enhanced promotor, will promote FrmRâ€™s responsiveness to formaldehyde, making it more sensitive to formaldehyde concentration. And BBa_K2728003, placed in the downstream of FrmR, due to stronger responsiveness of FrmR, will also express better.
When they are placed in the same carrier plasmids, engineered bacteria will be able to detect and decompose formaldehyde simultaneously.
