Interview with dermatologist
It is rare when sunscreen usage causes allergies. However, sometimes contact dermatitis             can be caused by such sunscreen compounds as PABA and oxybenzone. Sun can excite             several dermatoses, including discoid lupus and rosacea. That is why the dermatologist             strongly recommends her patients to use sunscreens with the highest sun protection factor             and avoid sun’s most active hours. On the other hand, spending a moderate amount of time in             the sun is beneficial: UV has a positive effect on winter psoriasis, atopic and seborrheic             dermatitis. The dermatologist says, that the younger generation is well aware of the need to use             sunscreen, while older people (main patients in Oncology Clinic) have practically not used             sunscreen for most of their life.

Survey
We carried out a survey about an experience of sunscreen usage and awareness of modern sunscreens. People from 50 different countries, including USA, Australia, Japan, India, Russia, United Kingdom, Turkey, Germany have filled the questionnaire. The total number of participants was 319.
While the majority of respondents wear sunscreen with moderate UV protection (30 SPF) during summertime, or when sunbathing. Only a few use every day.
The results of the survey indicate less than 20% of respondents have experienced side effects of the sunscreen such as itching, drying of skin, and acne.
Most support the use of sunscreen, but half thinks sunscreens are harmful to the environment. Two-thirds support the idea of the development of eco-friendly sunscreen.
In conclusion, we are excited that some many respondents support our idea and we would like to thank all of them!
