During the show we taught the host how to extract DNA from saliva, showed the DNA samples on gel, introduced a robot which was programmed to recognize different bacteria on plates. Through this example we explained, that synthetic biology is combination of robotics, information technology and biology.</P><P><A href="https://etv.err.ee/v/meelelahutus/ringvaade/uudised/0e9ffd64-af98-42fa-bb2c-d7d3c21925a6/teadust-voib-teha-ka-imelihtsalt"> Watch the show in Estonian</A></P><P> First months of 2018 our team members and Primary PI have been busy travelling the world with educational fairs.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="event" data-event-date="11.01.2018"><DIV class="details"><P> Study in Tartu info session in Tallinn - presenting Science &amp; Technology, synthetic biology, iGEM and UT’s iGEM team.
