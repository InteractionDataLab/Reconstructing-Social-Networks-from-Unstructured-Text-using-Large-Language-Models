Every year around 14,000 tons of sunscreen is washed into the oceans and seas.
A great number of commercially produced sunscreens contain chemical compounds with a broad-spectrum ultraviolet coverage, such as oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are extremely toxic to the environment. Sunscreen washed into the ocean results in a dramatic increase of the toxicity level, causing a variety of pathologies to corals, including bleaching.
To prevent this we can use natural UV protection compounds, such as
mycosporine-like amino acids.
Our team is trying to produce MAA-s in yeast, using the genes from two different cyanobacterial species.                     We are expecting to obtain shinorine and porphyra-334 (MAAs).
They work not only as sunscreen but also are able to protect skin from photoaging, have the anti-inflammatory effect and antioxidant activity and even could be considered as anti-cancer agents.
