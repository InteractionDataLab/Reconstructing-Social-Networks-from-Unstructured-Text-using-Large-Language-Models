However, sometimes contact dermatitis
            can be caused by such sunscreen compounds as PABA and oxybenzone. Sun can excite
            several dermatoses, including discoid lupus and rosacea. That is why the dermatologist
            strongly recommends her patients to use sunscreens with the highest sun protection factor
            and avoid sun’s most active hours. On the other hand, spending a moderate amount of time in
            the sun is beneficial: UV has a positive effect on winter psoriasis, atopic and seborrheic
            dermatitis. The dermatologist says, that the younger generation is well aware of the need to use
            sunscreen, while older people (main patients in Oncology Clinic) have practically not used
            sunscreen for most of their life.</P><DIV class="interview"><DIV class="person"><DIV class="name">Karin Hussar</DIV><DIV class="position">Dr. Karin Hussar has graduated from the faculty of medicine of the University of Tartu and
