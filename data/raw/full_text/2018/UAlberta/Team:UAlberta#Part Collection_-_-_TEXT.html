HemA-BBa_K2779900: The role of the HemA gene is to encode for 5-Aminolevulinate synthase from Rhodobacter capsulitis; EC 2.3.1.37. This gene was optimized by our team using IDT’s codon optimization tool for E. coli expression. It is a transferase; and is responsible for catalyzing the Succinyl CoA + glycine to 5-Aminolevulinate reaction:
This part has been characterized; details can be found on our Results:Synbio page.
HemB-BBa_K2779002: This gene encodes for δ-Aminolevulinate dehydratase in Escherichia coli strain K12; EC 4.2.1.24. δ-Aminolevulinate dehydratase is a lyase which is responsible for catalyzing the 2-δ-aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen +H2O(l) reaction:
Hem C- BBa_K2779003: This gene encodes for porphobilinogen deaminase from Escherichia coli strain K12; EC 2.5.1.61 which is a transferase. It catalyzes the 4-porphobilinogen hydroxymethylbilane + 4NH3 reaction:
HemD-BBa_K2779004: This gene encodes for Uroporphyrinogen III synthase EC 4.2.1.75  which is a lyase. It is responsible for catalyzing the Hydroxymethylbilane to Uroporphyrinogen III + H2O reaction:
HemE- BBa_K2779005: This gene encodes for uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, EC 4.1.1.37 ; which is a lyase. It is responsible for catalyzing the Uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen + 4 CO2 reaction:
HemF- BBa_K2779006: This gene encodes for O2 dependent coproporphyrinogen-III oxidase; EC 1.3.3.3; which is a oxidoreductase. It is responsible for catalyzing the Coproporphyrinogen-III + O2 + 2 H+ to protoporphyrinogen-IX + 2 CO2 + 2 H2O reaction.
