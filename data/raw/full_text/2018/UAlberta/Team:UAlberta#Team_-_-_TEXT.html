Anna Kim
Anna is a 3rd-year student pursuing a biological sciences and psychology degree. This is her first year participating in iGEM, though aside from that, she works for University of Alberta Libraries during the summer. Books and music seem to follow her everywhere—and that's how she likes it! You'll always find her humming/singing to one song or another unless she’s in the quiet zone of the library of course!
Clayton Molter
Clayton is in his sixth year of his biomedical mechanical engineering and biological sciences degree. As a student with a passion for interdisciplinary science, Clayton has worked on research projects ranging from biomechanics, prosthetics, nanobiomaterials, mechanobiology and to tissue engineering. Clayton’s first iGEM experience has provided him with a new-found love for synthetic biology. After having a lifelong irrational fear of bees, Clayton elected to extend an olive branch to his pollinating pals. There’s been a lot of progress, but good luck getting him into a bee suit!
EJ Agena
Ejouan, better known as EJ, is a 2nd-year electrical engineering student that first participated in iGEM in the High School Track in 2016. Two activities that EJ enjoys in his free time are making films and buying stationery. That, and procrastinating!
Ethan Agena
As a returning member of Team UAlberta, Ethan is excited to be participating again in iGEM 2018—his third year of iGEM! Ethan is a 3rd-year chemical engineering student in the Computer Process Control Option at the University of Alberta.  Aside from iGEM, Ethan is working on a research project revolving around engineering chimeric plastic degrading enzymes. As well, he has a deep love for the show, “Avatar: The Last Airbender”. Flameo, hotman!

Gerard Dineros
As 3rd-year as a chemical engineering student and participating in the iGEM competition for the first time, Gerard is excited to be a part of the team. His work on this team builds towards his future goal: to become a Fortune 100 CEO by means of the emerging biotechnology industry. Exposing himself to the biotechnology industry through iGEM will hopefully be a great stepping stone in this endeavour!
Irene Shkolnikov
With experience in microscopy and cell culture techniques, Irene is a driven team member who is participating in iGEM her first time! As a 3rd-year student in biological sciences, Irene is excited to be part of a growing bioengineering community at the University of Alberta while contributing to a project bigger than herself. In her spare time (if she has some), Irene enjoys rock climbing!
Julia Heaton
After studying abroad in the Netherlands earlier this year, Julia has finally joined our team in Canada. She is a 4th-year student with a biological sciences major and history minor participating in her first year of iGEM! In her time in the Netherlands, she was able to meet with a number of Dutch iGEM teams (shout-out Utrecht, Leiden, and Delft). She loves spin classes and dark chocolate, and she has an embarrassingly good knowledge of Taylor Swift lyrics.
Raegan Larson
Raegan is a fourth year Cell Biology student, first year iGEMer, and plant fanatic. She uses iGEM as a time suck to avoid thinking about the crushing uncertainty of being thrown into the adult world in 7 months.

Scott Bath
Scott is a third year cell biology student and first year iGEMer! Outside of iGEM, where he hopes to develop his lab and team skills, Scott is involved in queer organizations on campus and around Edmonton. In his free time, he is probably drinking tea and reading too much science fiction.
Talia Mary Dixon
A veteran iGEMer, the 2018 competition will be the fifth year that Talia has participated in iGEM! Talia brings a diverse perspective to our team as she is in her 2nd-year of political science. This also means she's never getting a job. She is also a member of the World’s Contingent for the University of Alberta Debate Society and one of their executive members, so she’s definitely not like other girls. Little known fact, Talia is the “Lorax” in human form!

Advisors
Dr. Robert Campbell
Dr. Campbell is a professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Alberta and is an expert in the fluorescent protein world. He spends his time as one of Team UAlberta’s supervisors, travelling the world from one conference to another, and camping. Cycling is one of Dr. Campbell’s hobbies and a fun fact about him is that he finds zen in packing.
Dr. Dominic Sauvageau
Dr. Sauvageau is an associate professor in the Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering at the University of Alberta.  Dr. Sauvageau spends his time supervising the Team UAlberta iGEM team and listening to a wide variety of music genres. An avid foodie, Dr. Sauvageau enjoys a good restaurant, especially one offering squid ink pasta.
Dr. Yi Shen
Post-Doctoral Fellow, Department of Chemistry
Rochelin Dalangin
Rochelin is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Chemistry developing fluorescent protein indicators for neuroscience. As the team’s mentor, Rochelin can often be found surrounded by the team, explaining ideas with crazy random analogies and non-stop sarcasm. Outside of mentoring, she can be found either randomly wandering the hallways looking for soda, coffee or food, or in the lab armed with a pipette, a 384-well plate and protein samples while listening to recordings of musicals. When not in the lab, Rochelin likes to go for scarily long walks (preferably in different cities that have musicals performing), watching theatre, experimenting with different restaurants, and catching up on the sleep debt acquired as an undergrad.
