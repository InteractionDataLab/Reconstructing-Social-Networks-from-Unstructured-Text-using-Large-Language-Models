Welcome to iGEM McGill 2018!
iGEM McGill is a student group based out of McGill University in Montreal. We are a multi-disciplinary team with a common goal of finding innovative applications of synthetic biology to solve current problems in the world. As part of the iGEM competition, our team aims to design, build, test, and measure a system of our own design using interchangeable biological parts and standard molecular biology techniques. We are very excited to present our project to you this year in Boston!
