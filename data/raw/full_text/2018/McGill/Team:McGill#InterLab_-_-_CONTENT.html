Using this data, presented in table 1, we were able to calculate a conversion factor of 5.478 in order to obtain the O.D. 600 values from Abs600 values for use in cell density readings. </P><P>Table 1. This table shows the absorbance values taken at 600 nm for both LUDOX CL-X and H2O using a spectrophotometer. The corrected Abs600 measurement was calculated by taking the difference between the mean 600 nm absorbances of LUDOX CL-X and H2O. The reference OD600 value was supplied by iGEM and was used to calculate the ratio of OD600/Abs600 which was then found to be 5.478. </P><H3> Calibration #2 : Particle Standard Curve </H3><P> The purpose of this calibration was to create a standard 600 nm absorbance curve of microsphere particle concentration. The reasoning behind using microspheres is that they are a good approximation of the size and volume of cells. The microspheres, given with a known concentration, were supplied by iGEM and were used to create the standard curves seen in figure 1. This curve can then be used to approximate the number of cells in a sample based on its absorbance reading at 600 nm. </P><P>Figure 1. The calibration between the number of microspheres and the absorbance at 600 nm. (A) A microsphere particle standard curve generated by using a spectrophotometer to take the abs600 readings of different amounts of microspheres/100 µL.  (B) A logarithmic graph of the same standard curve generated by using a spectrophotometer to take the abs600 readings of different amounts of microspheres/100 µL. </P><H3> Calibration #3 : Fluorescence standard curve - Fluorescein Protocol</H3><P>The purpose of this calibration was to generate a standard curve of fluorescence for fluorescein concentration in order to be able to convert from cell based readings to an equivalent fluorescein concentration. In addition, this standard curve of fluorescence was generated in order to compare the standard fluorescence output between different participating iGEM teams. </P><P>Figure 2. The calibration between fluorescence and fluorescein concentration (µM). (A) A fluorescence standard curve generated by taking the fluorescence measurements and plotting them as a function of fluorescein concentration  (µM). (B) A logarithmic graph of the same standard curve generated by taking the fluorescence measurements and plotting them as a function of fluorescein concentration (µM). </P><H3> Cell Measurement: Fluorescence and O.D. 600 </H3><P> Figure 3.
