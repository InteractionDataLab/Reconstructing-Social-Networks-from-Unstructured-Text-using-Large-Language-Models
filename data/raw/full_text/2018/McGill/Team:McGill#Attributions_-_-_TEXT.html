Rome wasn't built in a day, or by a single person.
Participating in this competition would not have been possible without the help and contributions of many, many people, without whom this project would never have taken off at all. We are very grateful for their assistance and while a simple list cannot do them justice,  we can only attempt to document as best as we can the ways in which these individuals have helped us succeed.
