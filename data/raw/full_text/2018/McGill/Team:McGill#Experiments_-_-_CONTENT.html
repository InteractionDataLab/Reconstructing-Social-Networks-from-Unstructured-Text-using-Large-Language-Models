The dishes should be around 60% confluent on the day of transfection. </LI><LI> On the day of transfection, dilute 1 μg DNA dissolved in TE buffer, pH 7 to pH 8 (minimum DNA concentration: 0.1 μg/μl) with the DNA-condensation buffer, Buffer EC, to a total volume of 150 μl. Add 8 μl Enhancer and mix by vortexing for 1 s. </LI><LI> Incubate at room temperature for 2–5 min then spin down the mixture for a few seconds to remove drops from the top of the tube. </LI><LI> Add 25 μl of Effectene Transfection Reagent to the DNA-Enhancer mixture. Mix by pipetting up and down 5 times, or by vortexing for 10 s. </LI><LI> Incubate the samples for 10 min at room temperature to allow the formation of the transfection-complex. </LI><LI> While complex formation takes place, aspirate the growth medium from the plate, and wash cells once with 4 ml PBS. Add 4 ml of fresh growth medium containing FBS and antibiotics to the cells. </LI><LI> Add 1 ml growth medium to the tube containing the transfection complexes. Mix by pipetting up and down twice, and immediately add the transfection complexes drop-wise onto the cells in the 60 mm dishes. Gently swirl the dish to ensure uniform distribution of the transfection complexes. </LI><LI> Incubate the cells with the transfection complexes under their normal growth conditions for an appropriate time for expression of the transfected gene. . </LI></UL><H5> Western Blot </H5><UL><LI> Cells were first lysed:  
</LI><LI> The media around the cells was aspirated. The cells were then washed twice with chilled PBS and the culture flask was placed on ice. </LI><LI> Chilled lysis buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 1.0% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0) was then added (0.5 mL per T75 flask). The flask was left on ice for another 10 minutes.  </LI><LI> A plastic cell scraper was then used to scrape the adherent cells off the flask. The cell suspension was then transferred to centrifuge tubes. </LI><LI> The cell suspension was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4°C at 12000 rpm. </LI><LI>The supernatant was decanted and the lysate was transferred to clean centrifuge tubes. </LI></UL><LI> A bradford assay was then performed to determine how much protein to load. </LI><LI> An SDS-PAGE gel was prepared to which equal amounts of protein were then loaded in along with a molecular weight marker. In total, around 25 μg of protein from cell lysate was added. </LI><LI> The gel was then run at 100 V for 1-2 hours. </LI><LI> The gel was transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane: </LI><UL><LI> A nitrocellulose membrane was blocked overnight at 4°C using blocking buffer.</LI><LI> The membrane was then incubated with appropriate dilutions of primary antibody solution in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. </LI><LI> The membrane was washed thrice with TBST for 5 minutes each. </LI><LI> Excess reagent was removed and the membrane was covered in transparent plastic wrap.</LI></UL><LI> The membrane was then analyzed for the protein of interest. </LI><H5> Bradford Assay </H5><UL><LI> A standard curve was prepared by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm of different known protein concentrations. </LI><LI> Cell lysate were diluted such that they have absorbance values on the standard curve (usually a 1:10 dilution) </LI><LI> The different cell lysates were added to different wells on a 96 well plate (with duplicates) </LI><LI> Bradford reagent was then added to the wells (at 5x conc leading to around 200 uL/well </LI><LI> The 96 well plate was then incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. </LI><LI> The plate absorbance was read at 595 nm. </LI></UL><H5> Flow Cytometry (FACS) </H5><UL><LI> Cells were harvested, washed, and suspended at a concentration of 5 x 10^6 cells/mL in a chilled solution of PBS containing 10% FCS and 1% sodium azide. The cells were then transferred to polystyrene round bottom 12 x 75 mm^2 Falcon tubes. </LI><LI> 10 ug/mL of conjugated primary antibody was then added to the cells. The cells were incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature. </LI><LI> The cells were then washed thrice by centrifugation at 400xg for 5 minutes and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS containing 10% FCS and 1% sodium azide. The cells were kept in the dark on ice prior to analysis. </LI><LI> The cells were then analyzed on a flow cut-meter. </LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
