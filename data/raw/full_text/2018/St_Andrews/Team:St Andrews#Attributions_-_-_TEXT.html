Faculty contributions
Clarissa Czekster—Dr. Clarissa Czekster is the glue that holds this team together.  She did everything from teach us how to use a plate reader to giving advice on what experiments to conduct next and from helping to conduct the lessons for primary school children to trouble shooting our system when some experiments didn’t work.  Thank you so much Clarissa!
Helder Ferreira—Dr. Helder Ferreira gave lots of good theoretical advice on the design of the system and was an excellent resource when we had questions or needed guidance on how to proceed.  He gave great examples of useful databases and software to use when designing each of our composite parts.  He also gave us safety training at the beginning of the summer as well as things to consider regarding aseptic technique.
Anne Smith—Dr. V. Anne Smith played a major role in the fundraising necessary to even begin this project.  She helped write grants and made contacts with funding bodies to help us pay for iGEM registration and the cost of Jamboree attendance.  She gave advice on possibilities for computational modeling strategies and was a major organizing force for the Scottish Meetup this summer.  She’ll also be serving as a judge at the Giant Jamboree.
Chris Hooley—Dr. Chris Hooley gave significant time and effort to help us in the modeling component of the project.  His advice and expertise were invaluable in creating the differential equations used to understand the mechanism of our system on a quantitative level.
Paula Miles—Dr. Paula Miles helped us design questions for the surveys for our human practices, shepherded the them through joint ethical approval from the Schools of Biology and Psychology, and will assist in their administration throughout this fall and into the future.
Mhairi Stewart and Alina Loth—Dr. Mhairi Stewart and Alina Loth were instrumental in reaching out to primary schools for our educational program, and gave great advice on how we should go about designing it.  They helped us make contact with Dr. Margaret Ritchie, and the outreach part of our project wouldn’t have been the same without them.
John Mitchell—Dr. John Mitchell was invaluable in securing funding from the School of Chemistry.
Student contributions
Izzy Dunstan: Involved in the organisation and planning of the project. This included designing the biobricks that made up both systems and presenting our project during the Scottish meetup and in Dundee. I also carried out plasmid cloning during the summer and helped with the DNA submission at the end of the project.
Morganne Wilbourne: Involved in fundraising for the project, the organisation of team meetings to ensure the progress of the project and helped out in the lab to finalise our systems.
Camille Young: Co-led the interlab study, assisted with the outreach programme, represented the team at the Oxford iGEM meet up and helped with the lab book write up. Was also involved in the following lab experiments: characterisation of mNeonGreen fluorescence from construct 9 and time trials for various combinations of cell lysis constructs.
James Hammond: For this year’s iGEM project I have, in collaboration with other team members, written the ODE models for the project. This involved meeting with Dr Chris Hooley to discuss the model and using Python to visualise our functions.
Madeline Alley: I wrote surveys which will be used to assess the usefulness of iGEM compared to staff directed reach assistance, then completed an ethics application to get them approved. I also wrote a classroom plan about studying strawberry DNA which will be used as part of a community engagement project.
Adrian David Aboyoun: Aided in the initial planning stages of the model and wiki. Will attend an outreach conference later this year.
Pierce Bozeat: Spent two weeks in the lab over the summer and helped carry out plasmid cloning, as well as writing up detailed protocols such as how we carried out transformations.
George Dooner: Helped in the initial planning phase of the experiments. His research focused on identifying molecules unique to biofilm formation in order to design the system for biofilm detection.
Luca Jordano: Completed a series of minipreps, and Mira preps for both the biofilm and cell lysis constructs. I have Completed a series of plasmid digestions, gel purifications, DNA ligations and transformations for the cell lysis portion of the experiment, a series of inoculations, and plated bacteria. I have attempted (and failed) plasmid digestions, and transformations for the Biofilm and part characterization portion of the experiment. I was also part of the design of the protocol and the experiment involved in the introduction of IPTG into construct 9 to induce a purifiable Neon green fluorescent protein. I designed and completed experiments on linking cell lysis constructs 1 and 5, and 2 and 6 and I gave a presentation along with Cam Young at the UK Igem meet up in Oxford.
Eleonora Shantsila: Designed and coded the wiki, aided with the mathematical modelling, worked on the organisation and planning of the outreach project  and worked on developing the resources for the outreach project.
Lucie O'Donnell: Spent the entire summer in the lab, contributing to the success of our experiments.
Lauren Ross: Helped in the initial planning of how to tackle each of the medal requirements.
Bethany Margaret Reaney: Co-led the interlab study.
Nina Petrovic: Assisted in the lab towards the end of the summer.
Eva Marie Snaith: Helped in the beginning of the inter-lab study.
Peter Edwards: Designed diagrams to represent the theory behind the cell lysis and biofilm detection systems. He was involved in data analysis for the cell lysis experiments.
Gavin Lamb: Helped with experiment planning and construct design, as well as lab work throughout the project mainly focussing on cloning. I also aided in modeling, helping to write the code to numerically solve the differential equations which formed the core of our model.
Lewis Macdonald: Ensured that the team completed as much as possible each day in the lab and kept track of the weekly aims for experiments. He also ensured that detailed notes were kept on the protocols carried out.
Ryo Yanagida: Helped fix bugs during the development of the wiki and provided photos
Filippo Abbondanza: Helped answer a few questions regarding the planning of our systems.
