The process essentially runs 5 Minipreps at once resulting in a greater yield of stable plasmid. This step was used to purify large quantities of unaltered vector DNA for digestion, gel purification, and ligation with our DNA g-blocks. The protocol was adapted from Pronobis et al. 2016.
      </P><H4 style="margin-left:20px;"> Aim </H4><P>To purify recombinant plasmid DNA from transformed E. coli cells in high concentrations for sequencing and further transformations.

Following this, a 50mL overnight culture was transferred to a 50mL Falcon tube and spun down at 3230xg for 20 minutes* at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 2mL of resuspension buffer (P1) with 50ug/mL RNase – fresh RNase was required each time. The resuspended 2mL was then aliquoted into 4 seperate 1.5mL centrifuge tube, each with 0.5mL of the resuspension*. Lysis buffer, 0.5mL, was added to each aliquot which was then inverted 4 times, and then left to incubate for 3 minutes at room temperature.Neutralisation buffer, 0.5mL, was added to each aliquot and the microcentrifuge tube was inverted 4 times before the tubes were then spun at 13,000xg for 10 minutes at room temperature. The supernatant was collected in a 15mL tube and the pellets were discarded. 1x volume (6mL) of 96% ethanol was added and the solution was mixed thoroughly for 5 seconds.
      </P><P>The solution was then loaded onto 5 spin columns in 3 sequential 700uL aliquots and spun at 13,000xg for 30 seconds before flow through was discarded. The columns were washed twice with 500uL of wash buffer, being spun after each wash at 13,000xg for 30 seconds and the flow through discarded. The empty columns were spun once more at 13,000xg for 1.5 minutes to remove any remaining buffer. Following this, the old collection tube was discarded, and each column placed into a new spin tube. The DNA was eluted from the column by adding distilled water, 35uL. This was left to incubate for 2 minutes at room temperature, and spun at 13,000xg for 2 minutes. The eluted DNA was collected in one tube and measured on the Nanodrop before the microcentrifuge was clearly labelled and stored at -20°C.

Minipreps typically produce ~50µL of purified DNA. This technique was used when lower levels of plasmi were required to avoid using a Miraprep.

The pellet was then resuspended in 250µL of buffer P1 (ensuring RNase was added beforehand) and transferred to a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube. Following this, 250µL of buffer P2 was added and the tube was inverted 6 times to ensure thorough mixing. Buffer N3, 350µL, was then added and the mixing step above repeated immediately. The tube was then spun down in a microcentrifuge at full speed for 10 minutes. The supernatant from this process was then added to a QIAprep spin column and spun down for 60 seconds. The column was then washed with 0.5mL of buffer PB and centrifuging again for 60 seconds. The column was further washed by adding 0.75mL and centrifuged for a further 60 seconds. The flow through was discarded and centrifuged once more for 60 seconds before the flow through was discarded. Finally, 50µL of distilled water was added to the centre of the column and left to incubate for 1 minute. The column was then spun down at full speed for 1 minute.

These protein sequences were optimised for E. coli and ordered via Integrated DNA Technologies. In order for these gBlocks to be inserted into our chosen plasmids (varying between pEHISTEV, pUC19, ad pSB1C3), the ends had to be cleaved to allow ligation into the vector. Over the course of the project varying enzymes were used depending on the vector (table 1). The following protocol was written up for an NdeI and PciI double digest.

The restriction sites used in each plasmid is shown in table 1. The following protocol was written up for an NdeI and PciI double digest of pUC19.

This was then kept in a water bath at 37°C for 2 hours. Following completion, the digest could then be purified via gel electrophoresis and used in a ligation with gBlock constructs cleaved with the same enzymes. A single digest was also run for each of the restriction enzymes.
     </P><H4 style="margin-left:20px;"> Note </H4><P>It is noted in the original paper on the Miraprep (Pronobis, Deuitch and Peifer, 2016) that over time the RNase in buffer P1 can degrade. This note was not originally caught by our lab team and as a result, Mirapreps of pSB1C3 and pEHISTEV likely gave us samples with higher levels of RNA and therefore deceptive DNA concentrations when analysed via the nanodrop spectrometer at OD260. This was identified on gels run after the digest which showed little to no DNA despite 2.5µg apparently used. As a result, the plasmid volume used was increased 10-fold. Due to our inability to appropriately identify the concentration of DNA in our plasmid stock, the exact mass of DNA used is unknown. Following purification, yields of roughly 20ng/µL were given.

In this example it was used to separate the cut plasmid to be used for insertion from the smaller fragment that has been removed. The single digests were also both run on the gel as a control. A QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit was then used on the removed band to purify the DNA.

This was heated in a microwave in 30 second increments to ensure the solution did not boil and was handled with care at all times. This was left to cool until it was possible to touch it and 5µL of SYBR Safe dye was added. Following this the gel was poured into the gel tray containing the gel fork and was left to set – ensuring no air bubbles were present. Upon setting of the gel and removal of the lane fork, 6µL of 6x molecular weight ladder was added to the first lane and the double and single digests were each mixed with  µL of loading dye and added into separate columns. This was then run for half an hour at 90V. Following the running of the gel, it was visualised under an LED light box – thanks to the use of SYBR Safe, no UV box was necessary.
     </P><P>Using a clean scalpel and under the LED light, the desired band of DNA for our cleaved plasmid was identified and cleaved from the gel – cutting as close to the band as possible and removing excess gel. The band was put into a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube and weighed to record the mass of the band. Using 100mg = 100µL, 3 volumes of buffer QG was added to the microcentrifuge tube and the tube was incubated at 50°C until the gel had fully dissolved – vortexing every 2-3 minutes to aid the process. Following this, 1 volume of isopropanol was added and the sample was transferred to a QIAquick spin column within a 2mL collection tube. The column was filled and spun down in a microcentrifuge at 10,000xg or 13,000rpm for 1 minute, the flow through discarded, and then loaded again until all of the sample was loaded on the column. Buffer QG, 0.5mL, was added to the column and centrifuged as above with the flow through discarded. Buffer PE, 0.75mL, was added to the column and the column was left to stand for 5 minutes before being centrifuged as above with the flow through discarded and the column was centrifuged for an additional minute. The column was then placed in a clean microcentrifuge tube and 30µL of water was added. The column was left for 1 minute before being spun as above for a final time. The final sample was then labelled and analysed via nanodrop.

Following this a blot takes place to transfer the proteins to a membrane with high protein affinity. On this membrane, antibodies specific to the protein of interest can be incubated. A secondary antibody that binds to the original can then be added that has a signal response – often fluorescence. This reporting method allows a rough quantification of the proteins present as well as a more concrete identification of the specific protein.

A negative control was produced from just construct 9 expressing cells as construct 9 doesn’t have a V5 tag. A positive control was produced containing a V5 tag only. Following the heating of all samples, a premade acrylamide gel was removed from its wrapping, rinsed with deionised water, and inserted into a minicell. The minicell was then filled from the inner chamber out with running buffer. Into the wells of the gel, 5µL of the ladder, 20µL of the positive control, and 25µL of the negative control and all other solutions were loaded. The SDS-PAGE was then run at 200V for 45 minutes and then gradually continued until the dye front reached close to the end of the gel.
    </P><P>While the gel was running, the sponges, 3MM paper, and the protein binding membrane were soaked in running buffer – with the membrane soaking independently flanked by tissue paper. The gel was removed from its case and trimmed down before being rinsed with distilled water. The transfer stack was then constructed with the sponges on the outer layer, the 3MM paper inside the sponges, and the membrane and the gel in between the paper. This was then inserted into the blotting unit and ran for 1.5 hours at 100V with an ice pack in the running before to prevent melting.

Next, the membrane was rinsed twice with 50mL PBS-T and transferred to another 50mL falcon tube containing 40mL PBS-T for a further 5 min incubation with shaking (room temperature). The membrane was rinsed twice again with 40mL PBS-T with the 5 min incubation step in between.
    </P><P>After the PBS-T was removed, 5mL of the secondary antibody solution was added to the falcon tube containing the membrane and incubated in the dark for an hour on rotating rollers. Then, the washes described after the primary antibody solution were then repeated in the exact manner. 50mL PBS was then used to rinse the membrane and the signal was visualised using an Odyssey scanner.
