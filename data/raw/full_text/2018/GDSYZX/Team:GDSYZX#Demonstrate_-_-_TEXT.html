1. Although we can’t test it in the real environment for safety reasons, through our model and experiments, we found that our project improved yeast can survive in heavy metal environment. And it can really reduce the concentration of heavy metal especially cadmium.
2. Due to today’s heavy metal pollution, our product have great potential for development. Our product is safer and stronger.
3. For our expectation, our product will be processed in special container, so it will not affect the ecological chain in water and eliminate the potential invasion of foreign organisms.
4. Through our survey we found that this product can survive in the market. People are willing to use our project in our daily life.
