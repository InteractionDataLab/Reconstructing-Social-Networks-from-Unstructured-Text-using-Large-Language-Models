The part BBa_K332011 was created by iGEM10_NCTU_Formosa. The part is a coding part, which is the coding sequence of Cry11Aa protein in Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. Israelensis. Cry11Aa is a kind of toxin protein towards larvae. Some ideas are concerning the over expressing and purifying the protein and thus to deal with the larvae. The most common expressing system is the E.coli BL21(DE3). However, original page lacked some relevant useful information. So, we decided to make a improvement of this part by testing its expressing level in E.coli BL21(DE3).And we cooperated with 2018_GZHS_United to achieve this goal. Thanks for their providing Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis.
