Modeling
1、growth curve model
(10^-1,10^-2,10^-3,10^-4,10^-5,10^-6,10^-7)     (0.443,0.108,0.055,0.047,0.048,0.049,0.052)     (0.476,0.114,0.056,0.052,0.048,0.047,0.049)     (0.476,0.126,0.057,0.049,0.048,0.047,0.053)
The first line of data is the concentration gradient of yeast，The second row to the fourth row of data is the corresponding OD value（Three parallel tests for each concentration），first, take the average of three sets of OD values，that is:
（0.46500000， 0.11600000， 0.05600000， 0.04933333 , 0.04800000 ,0.04766667 ，0.05133333）.
Then we do the linear regression with yeast concentration gradient and od value（With OD value as the dependent variable, the yeast concentration is an independent variable）
l:y = 4.137384x + 0.053376    R^2=0.9954
2、Chromium chloride concentration and yeast survival rate model
（1）When the reagent is 1ml, the concentration gradient of cadmium chloride is 0,0.05,0.1,0.15,0.2,0.25,0.3（unit：μmol/L）,we measured OD value of yeast.（Three parallel tests for each concentration），then we got the data：
(0.104,0.049,0.047,0.048,0.047,0.055,0.041) (0.108,0.046,0.048,0.048,0.041,0.047,0.049) (0.112,0.058,0.058,0.051,0.049,0.044,0.048)
first, take the average of three sets of OD values，that is: od = (0.10800000， 0.05100000， 0.05100000， 0.04900000， 0.04566667 ，0.04866667， 0.04600000)  Then we used the growth curve model.The OD value is brought into the growth curve model to obtain the corresponding yeast Concentration.，that is： yeast_concentration=(0.0991735021,0.0151391903,0.0006920307 , 0.0061060928, 0.0057889510, 0.0057096768, 0.0065819402)  We used the yeast concentration and the corresponding cadmium chloride concentration  data to plot to the scatter plot
As you can see, the second point is an outlier, and the model is fitted after the outliers are removed, resulting in the following image:
(2) When the reagent is 5ml, the concentration gradient of cadmium chloride is 0,0.08,0.16,0.2,0.24,0.32 (unit：μmol/L), and we measured OD value of yeast， od = （0.133,0.048,0.048,0.046,0.047,0.047） In the same (1), the corresponding yeast concentration is calculated using OD values First ,that is: 0.019232552 ，0.022056768， 0.007692882， 0.006106093 ，0.005788951 ，0.005709677 then, using the yeast concentration and corresponding cadmium chloride concentration data to fit the model.
（The second point in the image above is an anomaly.）
