Team:SCAU-China
During the experiment, we communicated with other iGEM teams which is SCAU-China. We had received various advices about our project such as how to use our plasmids Ppic9k better. And we had learnt something we never met in high school.
Team: SYSU-CHINA
We also communicated with SYSU-CHINA and they taught us how to make our wiki more beautiful as well as the  knowledge about art design. In this year's competition, we invited our PI professor Jing Honglei, Chang Yanqi, the current member and Li Siqi, the former member of, as our mentor. They guided us in literature reading and experimental design, and provided us with training in experimental skills on weekends and holidays. SYSU-CHINA is an undergraduate team from Sun Yat-sen University. In addition, they were very generous in providing us with the reagents needed to build the biobricks, and their team member Tao Kehan provided detailed instructions for our experiments in building the part BBa_K2585000.
Team: GZHS-United
Moreover, we help another peer iGEM team GZHS-United transform a gene named NS1-GFP.
