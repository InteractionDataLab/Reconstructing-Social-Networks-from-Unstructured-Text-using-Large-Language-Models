Team & Members
We are the Guangdong Experimental High School iGEM team from China. Our team consists of 14 members, and all of us will be attending the jamboree in Boston. This is our first year participating in the iGEM competition as representatives from our school.
STUDENTS
Zeng Zirong
I’m a student in Guangdong Experimental High School. I love biology and chemistry very much. I also want to do some experiment to create some new things, so I joined iGEM. In this competition, I can improve myself. Besides, the experiment for the competition brings me a lot of happiness, although it sometimes makes me feel sinking. We failed many times, but we never give up and keep on doing, finally we create our own yeast. As the leader of the team, I’m proud of our team.
Fu Yao
I’m a senior from Guangdong Experimental High School in China. Biology, especially genetics, is my favorite subject. I spent lots of my spare time participating in the biology activities in-and-out campus. For instance, last summer I secured an opportunity to work as an assistant to medical postgraduates at a hospital for a month. Also, I attending a genetic engineering camp last winter and I felt a thrill in my heart when I successfully made fluorescent E. coli on my own.
Wang Ruiting
I’m from Guangzhou, China. I’m 16 years old and I am a student from Guangdong Experimental High School. I like reading. In my room, there are many different kinds of books. Although some knowledge about Synthetic Biology is difficult for me to understand, I will still try my best to understand. In all the subjects, I am interested in Biology and Chemistry, so when I saw this competition, I soon entered for it. I believe our team can have a very nice idea and we can have an excellent work because we have support from our teachers and parents.
Lang Maner
My English name Chris, a sixteen-year-old girl. I’m now studying at Guangdong Experimental high school. At school, I’m good at Math and English，however, I like Biology best and that’s why I participate in IGEM. Besides, I enjoy reading books and listening to some music in my free time. In my concept, life is short, and we need to make every minute valuable，therefore, I always manage to be a teenager who loves life with great passion.
