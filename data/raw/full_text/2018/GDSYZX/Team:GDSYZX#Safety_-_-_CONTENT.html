Safety course. On the first day of the project experiment (7.22), our team participated in the laboratory safety course taught by professor zhang yishun of sun yat-sen university. </P><DIV class="iamg"><DIV><P>2. Enter the laboratory, put on experimental clothing, gloves and masks, and put all personal belongings into the cabinet outside the laboratory. </P><P>3. Before the experiment started every day, we cleaned, disinfected and cleaned all the glassware. </P><P>4. Do not eat or drink water during the experiment. Always keep the floor dry and clean. </P><P>5. Safe disposal of waste according to China's biosafety regulations and the laboratory regulations of sun yat-sen university. All creatures must be inactivated before they are disposed of. After using the centrifuge tube which has no harmful material contamination, it can be reused after sterilization. All experimental materials are kept and used only in the laboratory. </P><P>6. The materials we used in the experiment, including escherichia coli and pichia pastoris, must be processed by microwave before being discharged into the sewer.
</P><P>7. At the end of the experiment each day, all the experimental equipment should be cleaned, disinfected and put in the original position for use the next day. </P><H2>Raw material: </H2><P>1. After nearly ten years of development, the Pichia pastoris gene expression system has become a relatively complete exogenous gene expression system. With the potent and regulatable promoter AOX1, a variety of exogenous genes have been efficiently expressed. This is one of the strongest promoters with the most stringent regulatory mechanisms. In addition, promoters can be inhibited by glycerol or glucose when controlling gene expression. (In the follow-up plan, we will add this promoter, and in our special container we will also add appropriate glycerin or glucose to better control our yeast and enhance safety.)If problems arise, they can be controlled in time to avoid further pollution and harm. The protein translated by Pichia pastoris is modified and processed. As a kind of eukaryotic organism, the protein which they produce is closer to the natural protein and will be safer to enter the water. Now American FDA has evaluated engineering products from this system's genetic, and some of the recent formulations from the system have been approved by the FDA, so the system is considered safe. </P><P>2. Arabidopsis thaliana. The genes of our project were extracted from arabidopsis thaliana. The genome of arabidopsis thaliana is the smallest known plant genome. Arabidopsis thaliana is a self - pollinated plant. </P><P>3. Plant complex element synthase gene (PCS1), which exists in many plants, can deal with the effects of heavy metals on the plants, enabling many plants to survive in the environment of heavy metals. As a result, the gene has no ill effects on the plant itself. The PCS1 we used was optimized, pure and efficient, and the PCS1 was pure, which could not cause adverse effects. </P><P>4. Plant complexine synthase, which is synthesized in the yeast and remains in the yeast, will not harm the water and the plants and animals in the water, and will not affect the ecological environment in the water. </P><P>5. Through the study, we found that compared with other genes (such as PCS2), the yeast's tolerance to heavy metal environment, especially Zn2+ and Cd2+, was improved.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
