OUR WORK
Our goal this year is to create a kind of yeast for controlling heavy metal contamination in water. Heavy metal pollution has the characteristics of being enriched by the biological chain.Traditional treatment methods such as chemical reagent sedimentation mostly bring about great environment pollution and potential safety hazard. We aim at treating this pollution with yeast in an environmentally friendly, economical and effective manner. We found that gene PCS1 extracted from Arabidopsis thaliana can synthesize phytochelatins to chelate heavy metal ion. we use the genetic engineering techniques to take the pcs1 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana and then transfer it into the pPIC9K plasmid. The final step of the process is to transfer this plasmid into the yeastâ€™s cell and activate the gene expression of psc1.
