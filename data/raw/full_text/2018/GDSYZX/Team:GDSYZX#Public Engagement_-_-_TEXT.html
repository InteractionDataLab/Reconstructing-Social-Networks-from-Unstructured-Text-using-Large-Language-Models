First we have given lessons to students in our school. The lessons were about the water pollution especially heavy metal pollution in water. We gave them some examples about human with heavy mental poisoning. And taught them how to protect out water environment in our daily life.

Second we set up a booth nearby the subway. We printed some flyer about the harm of heavy mental pollution and sent them out. In order to call on people to protect the environment. We also recorded some videos about out experiment and sent them on the internet to let more people get to know about biology. People learnt more about iGEM through our videos

In addition, we set up a club in school in order to let more students join us. On the opening day, we also invited students from other school,  they gave us lots of advice. Whatâ€˜s more, we gave lessons on the internet. Many people were interested in our project. They realized the harm of heavy metal.
