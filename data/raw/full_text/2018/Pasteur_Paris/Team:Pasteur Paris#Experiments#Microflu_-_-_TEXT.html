General Protocols
PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) is a widely used polymer in microfluidics, for its biocompatibility and transparence, among other qualities. Here we show how to prepare PDMS for microfluidic chips, as well as how to demold them and bond them to surfaces.
PDMS Chip Fabrication
PDMS Chip Demolding
PDMS Chip Bonding
Materials
PDMS monomer and curing agent (Sigma-Aldrich, Sylgard 184, 761036-5EA)
Mold (epoxy resin or aluminium)
Isopropanol for cleaning purposes
Scale (Kern PCB 1000-2)
Plastic beaker
Vacuum pump unit (Vacuubrand PC 3 RZ 2.5)
Vacuum bell jar (Kartell desiccator)
Spatula
Stove (Memmert UM 400) at 70 degrees Celsius
Paper  (Kimberly-Clark SCOTT Blue)
Gloves (Kimtech Science PFE)
Procedure
According to the Sylgard 184 manual .
Pour PDMS monomer into a beaker.
Pour curing agent into the same beaker (1 g for 10 g of monomer).
Mix with the spatula for 30 seconds. Spatula can be cleaned afterwards with some paper dipped in isopropanol.
Put beaker into the vacuum bell jar connected to the vacuum pump unit in order to extract the air bubbles from the mixture (at least 10 minutes vacuum, look out for overflowings).
Pour mixture onto mold.
Put mold+mixture in stove at 70 degrees Celsius for 3 hours at least.
Materials
Razor blade (OEMTOOLS 25181 Razor Blades, 100 Pack)
Biopsy puncher (Kai Biopsy Punch 4mm )
Procedure
Use a razor blade to cut the borders of the chip and extract the PDMS from its mold. Avoid touching the circuits on your chip to avoid unwanted fingerprints.
Drill input and output holes with the biopsy puncher.
In some cases, before using your chip, you'll need to seal the circuitry. In order to do that, it is common to use plasma bonding to glue the chip to another surface (PDMS or glass).
Materials
Plasma cleaner (Diener Pico PCCE)
Distilled water
Isopropanol for cleaning purposes
Office duct tape
Fume hood (Euroclone aura vertical S.D.4)
Procedure
First, the chip needs to be cleaned in the fume hood. To do so, apply duct tape onto the surface of the chip you want to bond and remove it. Clean the chip with isopropanol.
Put the chip and the surface you want to bond it to into the plasma cleaner. The surfaces you want to bond need to be facing up in the machine in order to be exposed to the plasma.
Expose chip and surface 30 seconds to plasma.
Take the chip and the surface back in the fume hood.
You have 20 minutes to execute this step. Press the microfluidic chip against the surface. The surfaces that need to be glued together need to face each other. If bonding failed, repeat from step 1.

Membrane Filters
Soon enough we realized that we would need something to confine the bacteria, so that it doesn't attack the neurons during our experiments, or escape the device in a real prosthesis system. The solution came as a nanoporous membrane, that would also be used as the conductive element in our system to transmit the neuron's impulses to an electrode. The goal here is to coat alumina oxide membranes with different types of conductive polymers.
Membrane PEDOT:PSS coating
Membrane PEDOT:Ts and PEDOT:Cl coating
An aqueous solution of PEDOT :PSS can be prepared [1]. We decided to dip the membranes in this solution during the polymerization.

Microchannel Chip
We used the microchannel chip to test the effect of NGF on neuron's growth. Institut Curie allowed us to use their chip design and their molds for our experiments. The microchannel chip is composed of two chambers connected by microchannels of 5 micrometers width and 2 micrometers height, ideal to observe neuron growth. We then proceeded to enhance the chip with a few customizations. We integrated a nanoporous membrane in the chip to prevent our bacteria to come in contact with the neurons.

Unwanted living organisms in microfluidic chips can be a big deal, especially when these chips have to stay for 3 days filled with cultur medium in an incubator. The chips need to be exposed to UV rays in order to eliminate these unwanted organisms. We took extra securitiy measures, because we also needed to transport our chips from Institut Curie's lab at IPGG to Institut Pasteur.

Vertical Chip
The vertical chip was one of the designs for the support of the final experiment, that would serve as a proof of concept. The idea is to isolate the modified bacteria from the neurons using a membrane. To simplify the membrane's integration in a PDMS chip, a vertical design instead of a microchannel horizontal one was proposed.
