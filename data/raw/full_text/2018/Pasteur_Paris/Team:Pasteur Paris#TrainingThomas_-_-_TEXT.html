BUSINESS PLAN
Our technology aims at promoting nerves growth towards an interface between the body and a prosthesis, in order to transmit neuronal signals.
Besides transimitting a neuronal signal, we also want to ensure our interface to be sure and avoid potential infections.
Discover our fully-detailed plans for our interface between the body and the prosthesis !
Developping an innovation is good, but thinking of all the aspects of the user's life with our product is better.
To fully understand all the issues raised by our solution, we had to prospect and integrate human practices to our project.
We explored the prosthesis market to be sure our innovation meets the demand ; you can see here our full business plan.
Meet all our team members !
We want to thank all our sponsors who supported us during our adventure. Discover all of them here !
