She also gave us some advice about the experiments we could perform.
Dr. Bernard Zalc, Team Développement oligodendrocytaire et interactions neurovasculaires, Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle épinière (ICM), 75013 Paris For giving us a better understanding of nerve growth and some tips regarding their growth. He also explained to us the connection between the nerve and our interface.
Dr. Chiara Zurzolo, Unité Trafic membranaire et Pathogenèse, Institut Pasteur, 75015 Paris For letting us to manipulate our neuronal cells in her L2 lab.
Dr. Christine Rasetti-Escargueil, Unité des Toxines Bactériennes, Institut Pasteur, 75015 Paris For giving us important advice about the coating of our microfluidic chips.
Dr. Emmanuel Lemichez and Dr. Amel Mettouchi, Unité des Toxines Bactériennes, Institut Pasteur, 75015 Paris For letting us use their L2 lab to manipulate our neuronal cells.
Dr. Frida Loria Salinas, Unité Trafic Membranaire et Pathogenèse, Institut Pasteur, 75015 Paris For letting us manipulate in her lab, and for sharing with us some of her protocols about cell dissociation from fresh tissues.
Dr. Han Li, Team Plasticité Cellulaire et Modélisation des Maladies, CNRS UMR 3738, Institut Pasteur, 75015 Paris For giving us access to the L2 laboratory.
Dr. Pauline Spéder, Team Plasticité Cérébrale en réponse à l’environnement, CNRS UMR 3738, Institut Pasteur, 75015 Paris For letting us proceed with some protocols for the neuronal culture in her lab.
Stéphanie Chrupalla, Thermo Fisher Scientific - Life Science Solutions, 91963 Courtaboeuf For lending us an iBlot2 for the protein transfer from a gel to a membrane.
Microfluidics
Dr. Ayako Yamada, CNRS, UMR8640 Processus d’Activation Sélectif par Transfert d’Energie Uni-électronique ou Radiatif, ENS-Département de chimie, Paris For providing us the right contacts.
