They develop antifreeze proteins that have anti-biofilm properties. On our side, we also integrated into our interface a strategy to disrupt biofilm formation. To test the effect of our proteins on biofilms, we both performed biofilm assay on microtiter plates and decided to exchange our protocols of biofilm culture and quantification in order to compare them. </P></DIV><DIV class="block half"><H2 style="text-align: left;">iGEM Sorbonne U Paris – Interlab </H2><P>We also collaborated with the french IGEM team Sorbonne U Paris. They graciously offered us some <I>E. coli </I> DH5-<FONT face="Raleway">α</FONT> for the Interlab study. We also helped them when they started their experiments for the Interlab by responding to some of their interrogations. </P></DIV><DIV class="block half"><H2 style="text-align: left;">iGEM UNSW Australia – Law </H2><P>We collaborated with iGEM UNSW Australia who was looking to produce a discussion about patenting for science at a global scale.  They contacted us to see our interpretation of EU law since they have a training in Australian law.  
Our legal team, composed of 2 Master students in Intellectual Property law skyped with their team to share on problematics surrounding patent law, such as reconciling new biological inventions with the law, the issues with diagnostic technology, the European legal system concerning patent law, the organization of courts in France, etc.  </P></DIV><DIV class="block half"><H2 style="text-align: left;">iGEM Düsseldorf – Postcards  </H2><P>iGEM is not only about experiments and labwork, but also about bringing the topic of “synthetic biology” closer to the public, and iGEM Düsseldorf perfectly understood that. 
Each year, a bunch of iGEM teams is joining this project by promoting synthetic biology using self-designed postcards. We designed a postcard which shows our project’s logo on the front (Cf. Figure 1), and a small information text on the back. </P></DIV><DIV class="block half"><P><I>Hi mysterious team, 
Have you ever thought about bionic prostheses and nerve control? This year, we want to improve the living conditions of amputees by giving them the opportunity to connect their limb to a functional machine! To do so, we are developing an interface between nerves and prosthesis thanks to synthetic biology. Hope your project is going well!
See you at the Giant Jamboree in October!

For this, we designed a sign saying how far from Boston we are, and took a photo of it in front of the old French subway named after the Institut Pasteur (Cf. Figure 4), which was funded by Louis Pasteur and inaugurated on November 14th 1888 by the president at the time, Sadi Carnot.

Organized by the iGEM Aix Marseille Université team, the summer Mediterranean Meet-Up took place in the CNRS lab of Marseille, gathering 8 French teams and two Spanish teams. On Thursday, the event started with a 180-second presentation of each project, followed by questions by the Jury. Unfortunately, the weather changed the afternoon plans, instead of visiting Marseille under the hail, we got to know each other around card games. On Friday, we attended a roundtable on bioethics to question the risks of our project. We also had the chance to meet the Ambassador Thea Chrysostomou (Cf. Figure 8) and discuss with her about our project. In the afternoon, we presented our project to various researchers during the poster session. It was a very interesting and challenging task. </P></DIV><DIV class="block half"><DIV class="legend"><B>Figure 8: </B> Samuel, Alice, Thea Chrysostomou (iGEM Ambassador), Ellyn and Florian in front of our poster for the Mediterean Meet-Up </DIV></DIV><DIV class="block full"><P>All in all, it was a great opportunity to meet new teams and to discuss with teams that came to our meet-up, about the improvement each team had made over the summer.
