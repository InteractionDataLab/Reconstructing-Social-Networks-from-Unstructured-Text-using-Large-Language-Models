Let's meet our team!
Students
Etienne Axelos
LinkedIn
Etienne is one of our designers. He studies at the ENSCI-les Ateliers in Paris. He is always wearing black and fluorescent colors, which is very convenient because you can’t miss him. He is also a big music fan, and has special skills in rock’n’roll dance (very impressive!). As you can imagine, he is one of our funniest team members, you are never bored with him. But he is as funny as he is a hard worker, and we can always count on his help. By Emma
Alice Dejoux
Calm, determined, attentive and engaged: that’s how we see Alice. This young Parisian born in Marseille is currently studying at the prestigious school Chimie Paristech. Talented and always smiling she was one of the leaders of the Parisian meet up organisation and she also attended the Mediterranean meet up in Marseille. Her scientific experience made her show great involvement and perseverance in the lab while doing the modeling of the project. She is part of the 23 strong links of the team iGEM Paris Pasteur 2018.

Claire Dumont
LinkedIn
Claire is one of our three marvelous designers from ENSCi les Ateliers. But that’s not it! She is also the key to keeping calm and focused the other two designers, who are more extroverted. Yet, she still loves to make movie references and silly jokes. In the team, she works very hard to create amazing graphics and she co-developed our final 3D-printed interface. It wouldn’t be an easy task to count the hours she spent on Rhino software to achieve her great results. By Jonathan
Antoine Ehret
He is one of our dearest physicists studying at ESPCI Paris. He may seem like a shy person, but believe us: he is a man capable of wonders and knows a thing or two about inspirationnal speechs. In fact, you could consider him as our never ending source of encouragement. Each word that comes out of him fills you with determination. " You have to push back your limits each and everyday!" By Aymen
LinkedIn
Andreas Fyrillas
LinkedIn
Behind his calm and hard-working look, Andreas Fyrillas will not hesitate to throw a punchline at you. His studies at the engineering school ESPCI Paris give him the skills to be an expert on microfluidic chips. Not only does he work the oscilloscope like no other, but he also has a secret talent in the kitchen that he uses to delight us from time to time. Apart from coding the wiki, he enjoys sharing his self-made dubstep music with us. By Alice
Aymen Ghaneme
Aymen, currently a second-year student at CentraleSupelec, is a smiling Morrocan who is always in for a break and above all a great fruit sugar-free ice cream (in fact, after a while, we realized the break is only a pretext for the icecream). However, when he gets sufficient sleep, this hyper-active guy can use all his mathematical abilities on making models and will work for hours to solve any software bug. By Thomas
LinkedIn
Léa Guerassimoff
LinkedIn
Léa is our little chemist from Chimie ParisTech who specializes in making everything she does, cute. Her kindness and good mood always delight everyone. She is a real ray of sunshine even when she blows a fuse on the Wiki. She is very organized and serious in what she undertakes, but don’t bother her if she is watching a video of a toy goat: toy goats make her crazy, like really crazy. Regardless, she is one of the best people I have met, thanks to iGEM. We are now bosom buddies, that’s why people nickname us Tic & Tac. By Ellyn
Samuel Jaoui
Samuel is a 20 year-old engineering student from Chimie ParisTech. Despite being the youngest member of our team, Samuel was the first person to imagine and believe in this ambitious project and convinced us to create NeuronArch. His skills in biological engineering and programming help us to model scientific concepts of our project. By Etienne

Éléa Paillares
LinkedIn
Motivated and always smiling, Éléa always sets a happy mood in the room and never misses an occasion to crack you up. Although she spends her days locked in the laboratory working hard, making use of the skills she learned at Sup’Biotech, she has the spirit of a true traveler. Sometimes, she likes to go on spontaneous trips, not even bothering to book a hotel beforehand. She looks forward to the Giant Jamboree: she has never been to the United States! By Andreas
Emma Picaud-Lucet
What is more important to Emma than her cat’s happiness? IGEM of course! As a law student from the Faculté Jean Monnet, she is one of the members in charge of all of the legal aspects of the project. Never afraid of giving her opinions on various matters, she often deals with subjects beyond law, such as the human practices collaboration with other iGEM teams. Her secret talent: she’s a very talented cartoonist! By Samuel

Serena has been the key to answering many of our question, thanks to her extensive experience in microbiology. Her major contribution to the project as a coach has been in the Interlab, along with the many great ideas she has! When she doesn’t agree with something you will hear her Italian come out as she says “ma no!” followed, of course, by some hand motion. If still you disagree with her, try her delicious tiramisu. I am sure she (it) will convince you! By Anna
Anna Segú Cristina
With a true catalan heart and a great french accent, Anna is putting the best of her energies in her tutoring role for iGem Pasteur.
