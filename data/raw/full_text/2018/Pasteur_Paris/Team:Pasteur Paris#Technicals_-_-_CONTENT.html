Industrial design is a creative discipline that aims to produce innovative solutions in order to solve contemporary issues in various fields: health, well-being, energy, mobility, habitat, food, etc. When designing new products or services, designers apply a user-centric approach that integrates several notions such as usages, ergonomics, industrial processes, technologies, social, cultural, environmental and economic aspects. Taking into account all these parameters allows designers to conceive solutions that address the targeted issues in a relevant way and that benefit to the user. </P><P>Nowadays, industrial design is evolving. To address problems in a more and more complex and accurate way, industrial designers are getting closer to science by working with scientists and by settling in the labs. Our team is a good example of these new ways to co-create tomorrow’s innovations. </P><P>Despite promising opportunities offered by these new cooperations, designers and scientists do not have the same cultures, languages, tools, etc., that prevents these collaborations from reaching their full potential. To overcome these issues, we shared and thought design tools and methodologies with our teammates in order to build a common ground for understanding and co-creation. Once done, we followed the subsequent process :</P></DIV><DIV class="block two-third"><VIDEO width="100%" height="auto" controls=""><SOURCE src="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2018/3/3e/T--Pasteur_Paris--Video_Institut_Pasteur_1.mp4" type="video/mp4"><DIV class="legend">Design approach</DIV></SOURCE></VIDEO></DIV><DIV class="block full bothContent"><DIV class="block dropDown" id="Research"><H4>Research Phase</H4></DIV><DIV class="block hiddenContent"><DIV class="block full"><P>The first step of our innovation process consisted of an immersion phase. For a better understanding of our subject, we had to:
                                    -document the state of the art, recording and analyzing existing or inspiring initiatives, actors, and institutions;
                                    -meet with diverse experts, from associations (ADEPA, Figure 1) to industries (I.CERAM, Figure 4), through national institutes (CERAH, Figure 3) or hospitals (Georges Pompidou hospital, Paris Figure 2);
                                    -identify specific literature and technical documents regarding existing prostheses;</P><P>This step led us to understand amputees' daily life (behaviors, psychology, life environments, healthcare system, economic resources, etc.) and to specify the main issues (such as bacterial infections) and challenges to address in order to propose the amputees relevant and effective innovations. These contents (data, testimonies, etc.) have been collected thanks to human and social tools (semi-directive interview grids), design tools (mood boards), and documentation tools (photography, video, sound recording).</P></DIV><DIV class=" block half"><DIV class="languages"><B>Figure 1: </B>Meeting with Jean-Pascal Hons, member of ADEPA</DIV></DIV><DIV class=" block half"><DIV class="languages"><B>Figure 2: </B>Interview of Dr. Benjamin Bouyer from G.

                                    -cartographic and mind-mapping tools, to structure ideas

The following devices have been conceived and developed through design and engineering knowledge. Skills and tools (McNeel Rhino 3D (Figure 1) for 3D modeling, Luxion Keyshot for 3D rendering), as well as scientific and industrial advice from experts,  were also used.

                            - a nanoporous membrane made of PEDOT: PSS (5), to confine the biofilm within our system, to fixate nerves on it, and to allow the ionic current from nerves to be transformed into an electrical current, that would be processed and used to actuate a bionic prosthesis
                            - a thin structure (6) that supports the nanoporous membrane and transmits electric current from nerves to the stem (7, 8).

Injection molding is a reliable process that permits a low-cost mass production. Two removable shells (1) surround the main structure (2) to facilitate maintenance. An elastomer seal (3) is placed between these parts and make the device waterproof. Moreover, plastic has been textured to make user’s daily interactions with his device easier
                            - an antibacterial ceramic shell (4), placed between the stump and the device, to improve hygiene and to protect the user from friction

- Bluetooth Low Energy, a very energy-efficient technology enabling heavy data transfer on short distances, to share daily stored data from the device to the charging station, and vice versa
