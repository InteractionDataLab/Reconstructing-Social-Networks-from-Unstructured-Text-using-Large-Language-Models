The answer to these questions came as a double solution: confinement of the bacteria by conductive nanoporous membranes.

For this purpose, we used microfluidic chips. Microfluidic chips are patterns molded in PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane), which can be used to design tiny circuits for liquid flow. We used Institut Curie's design of a microfluidic chip, which has 2 chambers connected by microchannels of 5 micrometers width and 2 micrometers height. We enhanced the design by integrating a membrane filter (gold-coated) to prevent bacteria to pass from one chamber to another. As this technique was quite improvised and new, we didn't had access to the needed equipement for better precision work, leading to many chips being leaky. We managed to conduct an experiment were the chip did not leak and the filter succesfully retained the bacteria introduced in the chip.  </P></DIV><DIV class="block full"><DIV class="legend"><B>Figure 10: </B>Membrane filter retaining bacteria on the left (PDMS impurities on the right)</DIV></DIV><DIV class="block title"><H3 style="text-align: left;" id="Conductivity">Conductivity</H3></DIV><DIV class="block full"><P>The second criterion for a fully functional interface is its ability to conduct a neuron’s influx. Thus, conductivity measurements were made for different types of membranes. Results indicated that bare alumina oxide and PEDOT:PSS-coated membranes showed similar conductivities, indicating the incomplete coating of PEDOT:PSS on alumina oxide membranes. On the opposite, PEDOT:Cl and PEDOT:Ts exhibit on average better conductivities, but in the same time, the coating of these membranes revealed by electron microscopy seemed to have covered the alumina oxide membranes in a more uniform way, ensuring enhanced conductive capabilities . These results can be criticized because of the high deviation and because the membranes conductivity was measured after several biofilms were grown on them, which may have affected the measurements. </P><DIV class="block full"><DIV class="legend"><B>Figure 11: </B>Membrane conductivity</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="block title"><H3 style="text-align: left;" id="Biocompatibility">Biocompatibility</H3></DIV><DIV class="block full"><P> One last important property of the membranes is the capability of bacteria to form a biofilm on them, as in our prosthesis system, the membrane is going to be directly in contact with the genetically modified biofilm, as well as the human body.

However, it is worth mentioning that we are totally aware of the fact that we can’t just expect neuron axons to bind to our interface and produce an electric signal. The electric signal transmitted by a nerve is heavily limited to the interior of the nerve by myelin covering the axon, and the signal transmitted by the axon is purely chemical. So it requires special electrodes, like Fine or Cuff electrodes, to detect an electric signal. We might explore these solutions in the continuation of our project to enhance our interface’s ability to transmit neuron signals.</P></DIV><DIV class="block title"><H1>REFERENCES</H1></DIV><DIV class="block full"><UL style="text-align: left;list-style: disc;"><LI style="list-style-type: decimal;">Jikui Wang, Guofeng Cai, Xudong Zhu, Xiaping Zhou, Oxidative Chemical Polymerization of 3,4-Ethylenedioxythiophene and its Applications in Antistatic coatings, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 2012, Vol. 124, 109-115 .</LI><LI style="list-style-type: decimal;">Alexis E.

We will focus on the peripheral nervous system as it transports the information between the rest of the body and the central nervous system. Moreover, it includes the somatic nervous system which consists of afferent nerves, also called sensory nerves, and efferent nerves also called motor nerves. Afferent nerves are responsible for relaying sensation from the body to the central nervous system; efferent nerves are responsible for sending out commands from the CNS to the body, stimulating muscle contraction; they include all the non-sensory neurons connected with skeletal muscles and skin. Generally, the fibers of the somatic nervous system have an insulating sheath called a myelin sheath.</P><DIV class="legend"><B>Figure 1: </B>Structure of nerves, based on<SUP>[2]</SUP></DIV><P>Nerve fibers, consisting of axons and associated Schwann cells are grouped together in fascicles, sheathed by the perineurium (Cf.

This envelope allows the fixation of the nerve on the surrounding structures. It contains the lymphatic and vascular network which crosses the perineurium to communicate with the network of arterioles and venula of the endoneurium. The epineurium constitutes 30 to 70% of the total area of a nerve.</P><P>The fascicular architecture is ordered only distally, close to the emergence of a nerve trunk.

The influence of membrane potential on permeability can be summarized by stating: first, that depolarization causes a transient increase in sodium conductance and a slower, but maintained, increase in potassium conductance; secondly, that these changes are graded and that they can be reversed by repolarizing the membrane. </P></DIV><DIV class="legend"><B>Figure 2: </B>Electrical circuit representing membrane.

In other words, we need to know at a fixed time t0 the distribution of the currents generated by the nodes of Ranvier. In fact, Figure 5 represents the total activity of forty nodes of Ranvier. It can be noted that of these forty nodes of Ranvier, only a few are active simultaneously.

Introduction </H3></DIV><DIV class="block full"><P>The purpose of this part is to know the potential “seen” by an electrode wrapped around the nerve. For this, we will study the extracellular potential at the surface of the nerve by considering an axon parallel to the longitudinal axis of the nerve. Each Ranvier node is considered as a point current source. To estimate the potential at a point M at the periphery of the nerve, it is necessary to determine a transfer function linking this potential to each of the transmembrane currents of the axon. The simulation of the membrane current of the axone we developed previously is used as the input of the nerve model.</P></DIV><DIV class="block title"><H3 style="text-align: left;">2. Medium transfer function </H3></DIV><DIV class="block full"><P>J. H. Meier and al. developed a nonhomogeneous and anisotropic model of a nerve <SUP>[6]</SUP>. We consider a cylindrical nerve of radius a and an axon at a distance r from the axis of the nerve (figure 6). The nodes of Ranvier are separated by a distance l<SUB>my</SUB>. The point M, where the extracellular potential will be calculated, is located at a distance d = <FONT face="Raleway">ρ</FONT> - a from the surface of the nerve and at a distance <FONT face="Raleway">ρ</FONT>0 from the axon considered. The angle <FONT face="Raleway">θ</FONT> is the angle constructed from the radial position of the axon and the observation point M. The conductivity inside the nerve is different (<FONT face="Raleway">σ</FONT>z and <FONT face="Raleway">σ</FONT><FONT face="Raleway">ρ</FONT>) depending on the direction, longitudinal or radial. We consider two media other than the interior of the nerve: the perineural sheath that surrounds the nerve, of conductivity <FONT face="Raleway">σ</FONT>s, and the outside of the nerve of conductivity <FONT face="Raleway">σ</FONT>e.</P><DIV class="legend"><B>Figure 6: </B>Model of the nerve fascicle, with perineural sheath labeled “s” and external surroundings labeled “e”.<SUP>[6]</SUP></DIV><P>The active fiber is simulated as an array of active point current sources along the fiber bundle. Each source represents a node of Ranvier. A nodal distance <FONT face="Raleway">λ</FONT> of 1000 <FONT face="Raleway">μ</FONT>m is chosen. Current values correspond to the nodal currents of an active fiber of 10 <FONT face="Raleway">μ</FONT>m diameter at one instant of time.</P><DIV class="legend"><B>Figure 7: </B>The line represents the nodal current and the bars represent the currents of the active nodes. Each bar corresponds to one node.<SUP>[6]</SUP></DIV><P>From this model, the calculation of the extracellular potential is based on the calculation of the electric field in a cylindrical medium. J. H. MEIER and al. established an analytic expression of the extracellular action potential using the medium transfer function in the spatio-frequency domain <SUP>[6]</SUP>. With the simplifications we have chosen, this transfer function is the sum of the series presented below by separating, for each term, a factor depending on the respective positions of the axon and the point of observation, and two factors dependent on the physical characteristics of the nerve considered.</P><P>From this expression, it is possible to determine the &quot;spatial&quot; transfer function h2(z). To do this, it suffices to calculate the inverse Fourier transform of H<FONT face="Raleway">ω</FONT>2, which is done numerically as it can not be practiced analytically <SUP>[4]</SUP>. The behavior of these two views of the transfer function is shown in Figure 8 for two reference distances <FONT face="Raleway">ρ</FONT>0 between the observation point M and the axon.</P><DIV class="legend"><B>Figure 8: </B>Spatial transfer function h2(z) and space-frequency H2(k) of the nonhomogeneous and anisotropic medium for two distances <FONT face="Raleway">ρ</FONT>0 = 200 and 500 <FONT face="Raleway">μ</FONT>m between the observation point and the axon (depth of the axon in the nerve).<SUP>[4]</SUP></DIV><P>It is of course possible to go from the nonhomogeneous and anisotropic model to the homogeneous isotropic model by considering in the nonhomogeneous and anisotropic model that the conductivities of the media are equal to each other and that the perineurium is infinite. It is clear that the nonhomogeneous and anisotropic model is more realistic but the two models give relatively close medium transfer function variation trends.</P><P>We have described the two models in order to calculate the potential extracellular created by the presence of nodal currents generated at Ranvier nodes. This extracellular potential at a point M and at a time t can be expressed as the convolution product in the spatial domain between the nodal current i(z, t) and the transfer function of the medium h(z)<SUP>[4]</SUP>:</P><P>v(M,t) = h(z)∗i(z,t)</P><P>We consider the typical case of a 8.7 <FONT face="Raleway">μ</FONT>m diameter axon near myelin gains (length lmy=1000 <FONT face="Raleway">μ</FONT>m) and diameter 2.8 <FONT face="Raleway">μ</FONT>m near the Ranvier’s nodes.</P><P>The objective of this part is to study the spatial and spatio-frequency properties of the extracellular potential created by such an axon.</P><P>Two reference distances (<FONT face="Raleway">ρ</FONT>'=200 <FONT face="Raleway">μ</FONT>m and <FONT face="Raleway">ρ</FONT>'=500 <FONT face="Raleway">μ</FONT>m) are considered between the observation point and the axon. The action potential at the surface and along the nerve is represented figure 9 for the two previous models. Whatever the model used, the low-frequency component - space current envelope (see Figure 9) - is found on the action potential generated. It can be concluded that the action potential has the same wavelength as the nodal currents at Ranvier's node. The nonhomogeneous and anisotropic model, closer to reality, gives a greater amplitude than the homogeneous isotropic model. This phenomenon - due partly to the insulating effect of the extraneural electrode - allows to expect a more easily measurable amplitude at the electrode. We also note that the extracellular action potential has a high frequency ripple, we will call this ripple a High Spatial Frequency component (HSF).

Thus, the maximum selectivity, being reduced to the activity of a single fiber, is required for the measurement interfaces. Unfortunately, this search for selectivity will lead to a search for proximity between the electrode and the fibers, at the detriment of the nerve’s physical integrity. Indeed, the risk of infection or trauma to the body increases with the invasiveness of the electrodes. Electrodes can therefore be classified according to criteria such as selectivity and invasiveness. The ideal electrode is one that has the highest selectivity while remaining the least invasive possible. To make a choice, a compromise must be made between the selectivity and the degree of invasiveness of the electrode. The &quot;secondary&quot; criteria are stability and repeatability. We will present the neural electrodes by exposing their performances in terms of selectivity and level of invasiveness.</P></DIV><DIV class="block title"><H1>I.

The cuff-style electrode provides a cylindrical electrode contact with a nerve for each of an arbitrary number of contacts, is easy to place and remove in an acute nerve preparation, and is designed to fit on the nerve (Cf. Figure 1). For each electrode, the electrical contacts were cut from metal foil as an array so as to maintain their positions relative to each other within the cuff. Lead wires were soldered to each intended contact. The structure was then molded in silicone elastomer, and individual contacts were electrically isolated. The final electrode is curved into a cylindrical shape with an inner diameter corresponding to that of the intended target nerve. These electrodes have been successfully used for nerve stimulation, recording, and conduction block in a number of different acute animal experiments by several investigators.</P><DIV class="legend"><B>Figure 1: </B>Schematic of a nerve cuff electrode.

However, the triggering and control of muscle contractions use a similar mechanism to the propagation of nerve impulses. Thus, the vicinity of a muscle is the seat of important extracellular currents because of the large number of muscle fibers excited simultaneously. The potential differences associated with these currents are called EMG, for electromyogram. Action potentials in muscle have mV amplitude, larger than a neural signal, and their spectra overlap. Minimizing these forms of interference is there for essential.</P><P>In order to attenuate the EMG signal, tripolar cuff electrode are used (Cf. Figure 3). For the nerve signal, the main point of the cuff is that it reduces the volume of tissue in which the action currents flow and, therefore, increases the potential differences between the electrodes. For the EMG interference, the fact that the cuff is a tube of uniform cross-sectional area means that the gradient inside, due to each external source, is approximately constant and, therefore, the potential differences between the pairs of electrodes are equal and cancel. How they are canceled depends on the amplifier configuration but the principle is that out-of-cuff signals are canceled while neural signals do not.</P><P>The variation of the ENG is not linear over the entire length of the electrode, it is at a maximum in the center of the cuff.

Figure 5) uses a double differential array of amplifiers ('tripole amplifiers') and, for each selected velocity (of either sign), artificial time delays, as well as an adder and a narrow-band filter. An action potential transiting the nerve will be perceived in the same way by each tripole, but with delays inversely proportional to the speed of propagation of the action potential. If this time offset is compensated by the delay added by the measurement system, the action potentials appear simultaneously at the output of the delay stages. Thus, summing them to each other, the amplitude of the action potential is amplified. This system makes it possible to amplify the measurement for this particular action potential. Whereas, for another action potential having a different speed or direction of propagation, the amplification will not take place because the delay implemented in the system does not correspond to the delay due to the propagation of the action potential. This system is therefore selective for a given propagation speed.</P><DIV class="legend"><B>Figure 5: </B>Multi-electrode cuff (MEC), array of tripole amplifiers and signal processing unit for selecting one velocity <SUP>[7]</SUP>. </DIV></DIV><DIV class="block title"><H3 style="text-align: left;">3.
