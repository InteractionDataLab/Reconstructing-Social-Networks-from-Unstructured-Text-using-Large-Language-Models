Institut Curie’s lab MMBM at IPGG (Institut Pierre Gilles de Gennes) hands us the molds for the microchannel chip and grants us access to their lab. We have been taught the basic steps for the fabrication of the microfluidic microchannel chip: PDMS preparation, molding, demolding, punching, bonding.
07.11.2018
4 microchannel chips have been made. Molds for the PDMS well chip have been received. Glass microscopic slides coated with 2 nm chromium and 50 nm gold have been received for use in PDMS well chip. Glass slides have been cut into small strips with a diamond tip. Processing damaged the gold coating.
07.12.2018
First pieces of the well chip have been successfully molded.  8 microchannel chips have been made.
07.13.2018
Tested the conductivity of gold coated strips of glass. Failure. Too many scratches because of the cutting process.  Second successful set of PDMS pieces of the well chip molded. 4 microchannel chips have been made. 1 microchannel successfully bonded to an imaging dish, and filled with fluorescein. Observation under a microscope revealed that it is fully functional.

07.17.2018
Results: We went to see our bacterial culture:
Bacteria transformed with pET 43.1 had not grown.
Bacteria transformed with pSB1C3 had formed colonies.
Interpretations: Bacteria transformed with pET 43.1 did not grow. We found a non-commercial tube of pET 43.1  in the freezer from last year team, and we decided to try to amplify it because we did not have any commercial tubes of pET 43.1. Transformation did not work as expected, probably because:
There was no DNA left in the tube.
The concentration of DNA was too low .
We cultivated the transformed pSB1C3 bacteria in liquid medium 2 x 25ml + Chloramphenicol (25µg/ml) overnight at 37°C, 180 rpm.
Results: Bacteria successfully transformed with pSB1C3. (See here the liquid culture protocol)
07.18.2018
Extraction: We extracted the pSB1C3 plasmid from the bacterial culture. The protocol used was the Qiagen Plasmid Purification Kit (See Midiprep for plasmid extraction protocol here ) Measure of the DNA concentration in each tube thanks to the NanoDrop (Blank used : TE.1) (See the NanoDrop protocol here )
Results: We used the Nanodrop to quantify the purified DNA.

Interpretations:
Tube 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 did not contain DNA at all. This problem can be due to the fact that we failed the precipitation with ethanol, meaning that when we removed all the supernatant, we also removed the DNA, or that we removed by mistake the DNA pellet when removing all the supernatant after precipitation (the pellet was so small that we couldn’t see it with the naked eye).
Tube 3, 4 and 5 had DNA inside. The amount of DNA obtained is enough for us. These tubes have been placed in the freezer for later use.
Transformation: We received from Eurofins our first sequences:
3a_NGF construction Part1 (Seq1)
3a_NGF construction Part2 (Seq2)
T7 RIP construction (Seq8)
In order to constitute a stock of this commercial vectors, we transformed DH5-α competent cells with the plasmid we received, and then we cultivated them on agar plates covered with LB medium and carbenicillin. As the bacteria transformed with pET 43.1a did not grow, we tried again to transform the bacteria with pET 43.1a in a higher quantity than previously.

Interpretations: Transformation of Seq#1 – 3a_NGF_Part1, Seq#2 – 3a_NGF_Part2 and Seq #8 – T7_RIP did work as expected. Transformation of Pet43.1a (+) did not work again. As mentioned before, the tube of pET43.1a (+) was a non-commercial tube that we found in the freezer from last year’s team, and we decided to try to amplify it because we did not have any commercial tubes of pET 43.1. We tried to transform our bacteria twice, with no results, so the most probable hypothesis is that the tube did not contain DNA anymore. After this experiment, we decided to buy a tube pET43.1a(+). We cultivated two different colonies from each plate (seq#1, seq#2, seq#8):
One in an Erlenmeyer in 25 ml LB medium + Carbenicillin (100µg/ml) overnight at 37°C, 180 rpm.
One in two Falcon tube in 15 ml LB medium + Carbenicillin (100µg/ml) overnight at 37°C, 180 rpm.

The tube of pET43.1a (+) was another non-commercial tube that we found in the freezer from last year’s team, and we decided to try to amplify it because we did not have any commercial tubes of pET 43.1. We tried to transform our bacteria twice, with no results, so the most probable hypothesis is that the tube did not contain DNA anymore. We are still waiting for the commercial pET43.1a(+) (we ordered it last week).

We did a biofilm transfer. We took our filter with the biofilm and transferred it on another porous filter placed on a new petri dish LB + Cm. Then we removed the filter containing the biofilm and incubated the plate overnight at 37°C.
Liquid culture: We cultivated two different colonies from each plate (Seq5, Seq7 and pBR322):
One in an Erlenmeyer in 25 mL LB medium + Carbenicillin (100 µg/ml) overnight at 37°C, 180 rpm.
One in two Falcon tube in 15 mL LB medium + Carbenicillin (100 µg/ml) overnight at 37°C, 180 rpm.
Moreover, for each colony of each DNA part we did some streaks on a plate and incubated them at 37°C. (See here the liquid culture protocol)
Midiprep pVDL 9.3: We extracted the pVDL 9.3 plasmid from the HB2151 strain. The protocol use was the Qiagen Plasmid Purification Kit (See Midiprep for plasmid extraction protocol here ) We divided the eluted DNA into 8 tubes before centrifugation. Measure of the DNA concentration in each tube by the NanoDrop. Blank used : TE.1 (See the NanoDrop protocol here )
Results: We used the Nanodrop to quantify the purified DNA for SEQ: pVDL 9.3 1.

Interpretations: There is DNA in all the tubes. For Seq5 and Seq7, we obtain high DNA concentrations, which is good. For pBR322, the DNA concentration is lower. This is probably due to the fact that pB322 is a low copy plasmid. However, the quantity of DNA is enough.
Preparing cultures for stocks: We set some pre-cultures of Seq5, Seq7 and pBR322, in order to make some stocks to store at -80°C.  In a 15 mL Falcon tube, we placed 5 mL of LB media, and 10 μL of antibiotic (Carbenicillin). We added one of each colony inside each Falcon and placed the Falcon tubes inside the incubator (37°C – 180 rpm) and let grow overnight.

Inactivate the digestion by heating the mixture in a heat block at 80 °C for 20 minutes.
Electrophoresis on agarose gel We prepared an Agarose gel. (See here the Agarose Gel Preparation protocol) We filled:
1 well with the digested pBR322 (n°1)
2 wells with the digested plasmids containing Seq8 (n°2 and 3)
1 well with a DNA ladder (n°4)
We let the DNA migrate for 10 minutes at 85 V and then 40 minutes at 125 V. We then revealed the gel under UV lamp. Results:
Figure 1:
Interpretations:
pBR322 (4361 bp) has been successfully linearized
pEXA258 from Eurofins Genomics has also been successfully digested. We obtained two fragments corresponding to our insert (459 bp) and the linearized plasmid (2909 bp)

Results: ligation cultures
Figure 2: Negative Control
Figure 3: Positive Control
Figure 4: Ligation of pBR322 and Seq8 (T7-RIP)
As expected, we could observe a lot of colonies for the positive control. Some colonies had grown for the negative control (due to the linearized plasmid which circularized itself). For our ligated plasmid, we only observed a few colony (as much as in the negative control) so we didn’t know if the ligation succeeded. This is why we picked up 20 colonies and cultivated them overnight, hoping that one of these had the correct plasmid. The plate containing DH5-α transformed with Seq6 also had a lot of colonies, as expected.
Liquid culture of DH5-α with Seq6 We cultivated 2 different colonies in 250 mL Erlenmeyer containing:
25 mL LB medium
25 μL carbenicillin (25 mg/mL)
We cultivated it overnight in a shaking incubator at 37°C, 180 rpm. (See here the liquid culture protocol)
Liquid culture of Stellar transformed with pBR322-Seq8 We cultivated 20 different colonies in order to maximize our chance to get one successful ligated plasmid. Each colony was cultivated in a 15 mL Falcon tube containing:
5 mL LB medium
5 μL carbenicillin (25 mg/mL)
We cultivated it overnight in a shaking incubator at 37°C, 180 rpm. We also cultivated each colony on petri dishes LB agar plate supplemented with carbenicillin overnight at 37°C.

Seq3 : NGF-GFP Part1 : 4.0 μg
pET 43.1a : 0.5 μg/μL
Sequence from Eurofins Genomics under the form of lyophilized powder so we need to re-suspend it.
Centrifuge in order to make sure that all the plasmids are at the bottom of the tube and not in the lid.
Re-suspend the powder in TE 1X.  We resuspended it into 400 μL TE, in order to obtain a concentration of 10 ng/μL.
Transformation of the plasmids in DH5α competent cells:
volume of competent cells: 50 μL
pET 43.1a: 50 pg (1 μL of commercial plasmid diluted 1/10000)
Seq3 : 10 ng (1 μL)
(See here the transformation of E. coli DH5-alpha protocol)
Culture on petri dishes LB agar plate supplemented with carbenicillin overnight at 37°C.
08.01.2018
We went to see our cultures:
Figure 5:
All the colonies of our ligation (pBR322 + Seq8) grew except one.
DH5α transformed with Seq3 grew.
DH5α transformed with pET 43.1a did not grow.
Hypothesis:
We might have diluted the plasmid or the bacteria too much.
We did not homogenize the solution enough during the dilution of the commercial solution.
We did not pipet correctly the 1 μL of plasmid from the commercial tube.

We chose to verify which colony had acquired the plasmid containing the Seq8 insert. To do so, we digested the plasmid with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI and ran a 1% agarose gel. The size of the plasmid pBR322 is 4361 bp. Once we cut the sequence between the sites EcoRI (bp position 4359) and PstI (bp position 3611), this leaves us with an empty backbone of 3613 bp. The size of the insert Seq8 is 461 bp. Here we made a mistake, by confusing the right restriction enzymes to use. Indeed, we should have used XbaI and SpeI instead of EcoRI and PstI. Moreover, as these two restriction sites are present in the pBR322 backbone (748 bp away), this digestion should show two DNA fragments.
1% Agarose gel of the miniprep of the ligated plasmid (pBR322 + Seq8) from Stellar Only the first half of the samples (1 to 11) were deposed today. The preparation of the gel was done according to the Agarose Gel Preparation protocol. The samples were made according to the following proportions:
5 µL DNA
3 µL 10X Cutsmart Buffer
1 µL EcoRI
1 µL PstI
20 µL H2O
These samples were then incubated for 10 min at 37°C to allow digestion by the enzymes. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 6 µL of 6X Loading Dye. Results:
Figure 6:
/br>
This resulting gel shows the two DNA fragments we expected. Moreover, the column 3 shows a lower molecular weight (MW) than others for the plasmid part. As this part is supposed to contain our insert, it might suggest that colony 3 doesn’t possess the insert, but all others do. However, we will need to make the right experiment using restriction enzymes XbaI and SpeI (see date 08.02.2018) to verify that our insert was correctly put into the plasmid.

Inactivate the digestion by heating the mixture in a heat block at 80 °C for 20 min.
Electrophoresis on agarose gel We prepared an 0.8 % agarose gel to separate the different fragments of the cut plasmids. (See here the Agarose Gel Preparation protocol) We filled:
2 wells with digested pET43.1a (n°1 and n°2)
2 wells with insert Seq1 (n°3 and n°4)
2 wells with insert Seq2 (n°5 and n°6)
1 well with the DNA ladder
We let the DNA migrate for 10 minutes at 85 V on order to let the DNA penetrate the gel, and then 40 min at 125 V to efficiently separate the fragments. We then revealed the gel under UV lamp.
Figure 7: Electrophoresis gel 0.8% (1. 2. pET43.1a / 3. 4. Seq1 / 5. 6. Seq2) before DNA extraction
Interpretations:
pET43.1a (7275 bp) has been successfully linearized into two fragments (5 kb and 2 kb)
pEXA258 – Seq1 from Eurofins Genomics has also been successfully digested. We obtained two fragments corresponding to our insert (1105 bp) and the linearized plasmid (2446 bp)
pEXA258 – Seq2 from Eurofins Genomics has also been successfully digested. We obtained two fragments corresponding to our insert (1159 bp) and the linearized plasmid (2446 bp)

Biofilm growth measurement. Liquid culture of BL21 and biofilm culture on 6 PDMS well chips.
Membrane microchannel chip bacteria confinement experiment. Optical density measure of a sample of liquid culture. Liquid culture was poured in a microchannel chip on one side, and optical density of the liquid that flowed to the other side of the microchannnels was measured.
Results
Liquid culture OD: 0.44
OD of liquid after flowing through the chip: 0.41.
Interpretation
We expected a much lower OD after liquid flow through the chip, so this suggests the presence of a leak in the chip, that allows the liquid culture to flow without retaining the bacteria. The decision was taken to investigate further and to observe the flow under a microscope.

Biofilm growth measurement.
Measurement of the electrical resistance of the membranes with the biofilm.
Measurement of the membrane's electrical resistance without biofilm.
Results: membrane conductivity
Function generator was set on square at 200 Hz.  The physical quantities measured are Eg, the generator tension amplitude, and Ep, the amplitude of the voltage difference between a point on the membrane inside the well and the extremity of the platinium strip outside the well. Tension amplitude of the resistor is given by Er = Eg - Ep. Current flowing through the electric circuit is calculated with I = Er/R. Conductivity of the membrane is given by I/Ep. Conductivity of each membrane was measured 3 times. Figure 1 shows the mean value for each membrane and the standard deviation.
Figure 1: Membrane conductivity
Interpretation
Bare alumina oxide and PEDOT:PSS-coated membranes show similar conductivies, indicating the incomplete coating of PEDOT:PSS on alumina oxide membranes. On the opposite, PEDOT:Cl and PEDOT:Ts seem to exhibit on average better conductivities, but in the same time, the coating of these membranes revealed by electron microscopy seemed to have covered the alumina oxide membranes in a more uniform way, assuring enhanced conductive capabilities. These results can be criticized because of the high deviation and because the membranes conductivity was measured after several biofilms were grown on them, which may have affected the measurements.

For conductivity measurements, function generator was set on square at 200 Hz. The physical quantities measured are Eg, the generator tension amplitude, and Ep, the amplitude of the voltage difference between a point on the biofilm inside the well and the extremity of the platinium strip outside the well. Tension amplitude of the resistor is given by Er = Eg - Ep. Current flowing through the electric circuit is calculated with I = Er/R. Conductivity of the membrane is given by I/Ep. Conductivity of each membrane with a biofilm was repeated 3 times. Figure 4 shows the average conductivity of the membrane with the biofilm, and the standard deviation.
Figure 3: Membrane conductivity with biofilm
To evaluate the conductivity of the biofilm, the average conductivity values of the membranes with a biofilm were divided by the corresponding average biofilm growth values, and the conductivity of the membrane was then substracted. Figure 4 shows the estimated biofilm conductivity.
