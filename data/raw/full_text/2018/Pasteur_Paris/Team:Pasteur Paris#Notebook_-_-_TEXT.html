Institut Curie’s lab MMBM (Macromolécules et Microsystèmes en Biologie et en Médecine) at IPGG (Institut Pierre Gilles de Gennes) handed us the molds for the microchannel chip and granted us access to their lab. We have been taught the basic steps for the fabrication of the microfluidic microchannel chip: PDMS preparation, molding, demolding, punching, bonding.
Basic steps protocols here .
07.11.2018
4 microchannel chips have been made. Molds for the PDMS well chip have been received. Glass microscopic slides coated with 2 nm chromium and 50 nm gold have been received for use in PDMS well chip. Glass slides have been cut into small strips with a diamond tip. Processing damaged the gold coating.
Microchannel chip fabrication protocols here .
07.12.2018
First pieces of the well chip have been successfully molded.  8 microchannel chips have been made.

07.13.2018
Tested the conductivity of gold coated strips of glass. Current doesn't seem to pass through the strips. It is supposed that the numerous scratches caused by the cutting process are the cause for the non-conductivity of the strips. It was realized after the cutting process, that the conductivity should also have been measured before cutting.

Second successful set of PDMS pieces of the well chip molded. 4 microchannel chips have been made. 1 microchannel successfully bonded to an imaging dish, and filled with fluorescein. Observation under a microscope revealed that it is fully functional.

07.17.2018
Results: We went to see our bacterial culture:
Bacteria transformed with pET 43.1 had not grown.
Bacteria transformed with pSB1C3 had formed colonies.
Interpretations: Bacteria transformed with pET 43.1 did not grow. We found a non-commercial tube of pET 43.1  in the freezer from last year team, and we decided to try to amplify it because we did not have any commercial tubes of pET 43.1. Transformation did not work as expected, probably because:
There was no DNA left in the tube.
The concentration of DNA was too low .
We cultivated the transformed pSB1C3 bacteria in liquid medium 2 x 25ml + Chloramphenicol (25µg/ml) overnight at 37°C, 180 rpm.
Results: Bacteria successfully transformed with pSB1C3. (See here the liquid culture protocol)
07.18.2018
Extraction: We extracted the pSB1C3 plasmid from the bacterial culture. The protocol used was the Qiagen Plasmid Purification Kit (See Midiprep for plasmid extraction protocol here ) Measure of the DNA concentration in each tube thanks to the NanoDrop (Blank used : TE.1) (See the NanoDrop protocol here )
Results: We used the Nanodrop to quantify the purified DNA.

Interpretations:
Tube 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 did not contain DNA at all. This problem can be due to the fact that we failed the precipitation with ethanol, meaning that when we removed all the supernatant, we also removed the DNA, or that we removed by mistake the DNA pellet when removing all the supernatant after precipitation (the pellet was so small that we couldn’t see it with the naked eye).
Tube 3, 4 and 5 had DNA inside. The amount of DNA obtained is enough for us. These tubes have been placed in the freezer for later use.
Transformation: We received from Eurofins our first sequences:
3a_NGF construction Part1 (Seq1)
3a_NGF construction Part2 (Seq2)
T7 RIP construction (Seq8)
In order to constitute a stock of this commercial vectors, we transformed DH5-α competent cells with the plasmid we received, and then we cultivated them on agar plates covered with LB medium and carbenicillin. As the bacteria transformed with pET 43.1a did not grow, we tried again to transform the bacteria with pET 43.1a in a higher quantity than previously.

Interpretations: Transformation of Seq1 – 3a_NGF_Part1, Seq2 – 3a_NGF_Part2 and Seq8 – T7_RIP did work as expected. Transformation of Pet43.1a (+) did not work again. As mentioned before, the tube of pET43.1a (+) was a non-commercial tube that we found in the freezer from last year’s team, and we decided to try to amplify it because we did not have any commercial tubes of pET 43.1. We tried to transform our bacteria twice, with no results, so the most probable hypothesis is that the tube did not contain DNA anymore. After this experiment, we decided to buy a tube pET43.1a(+). We cultivated two different colonies from each plate (Seq1, Seq2, Seq8):
One in an Erlenmeyer in 25 ml LB medium + Carbenicillin (100µg/ml) overnight at 37°C, 180 rpm.
One in two Falcon tube in 15 ml LB medium + Carbenicillin (100µg/ml) overnight at 37°C, 180 rpm.

We did a biofilm transfer. We took our filter with the biofilm and transferred it on another porous filter placed on a new petri dish LB + Cm. Then we removed the filter containing the biofilm and incubated the plate overnight at 37°C.
Liquid culture: We cultivated two different colonies from each plate (Seq5, Seq7 and pBR322):
One in an Erlenmeyer in 25 mL LB medium + Carbenicillin (100 µg/ml) overnight at 37°C, 180 rpm.

Measure of the DNA concentration in each tube by the NanoDrop. Blank used : TE.1 (See the NanoDrop protocol here )
Results: We used the Nanodrop to quantify the purified DNA for Seq: pVDL 9.3 1.

Interpretations: There is DNA in all the tubes. For Seq5 and Seq7, we obtain high DNA concentrations, which is good. For pBR322, the DNA concentration is lower. This is probably due to the fact that pB322 is a low copy plasmid. However, the quantity of DNA is enough.
Preparing cultures for stocks: We set some pre-cultures of Seq5, Seq7 and pBR322, in order to make some stocks to store at -80°C.  In a 15 mL Falcon tube, we placed 5 mL of LB media, and 10 μL of antibiotic (Carbenicillin). We added one of each colony inside each Falcon and placed the Falcon tubes inside the incubator (37°C – 180 rpm) and let grow overnight.

Platinum wires received and conductivity tested. Function generator was set on sine. The physical quantities measured here are Eg, the generator's tension amplitude and Ep, the voltage difference between the two extremities of a platinum wire. the quantity calculated here is 20*log(Ep/Eg) for different frequencies.
Results
Figure 1: Conductivity of a platinum wire for different frequencies
Interpretation
Voltage difference calculated is extremely low, indicating a very good conductivity for the platinum wires, so its resistance (in low frequencies) can be neglected at first glance when it will be used in PDMS well chips. Resistance increases in higher frequencies, because of the skin-effect in metals: the strip transforms into an antenna. But as we are going to use only low frequencies, this doesn't affect us.

Inactivate the digestion by heating the mixture in a heat block at 80 °C for 20 minutes.
Electrophoresis on agarose gel We prepared an Agarose gel. (See here the Agarose Gel Preparation protocol) We filled:
1 well with the digested pBR322 (n°1)
2 wells with the digested plasmids containing Seq8 (n°2 and 3)
1 well with a DNA ladder (n°4)
We let the DNA migrate for 10 minutes at 85 V and then 40 minutes at 125 V. We then revealed the gel under UV lamp. Results:

Interpretations:
pBR322 (4361 bp) has been successfully linearized
pEXA258 from Eurofins Genomics has also been successfully digested. We obtained two fragments corresponding to our insert (459 bp) and the linearized plasmid (2909 bp)

As expected, we could observe a lot of colonies for the positive control. Some colonies had grown for the negative control (due to the linearized plasmid which circularized itself). For our ligated plasmid, we only observed a few colony (as much as in the negative control) so we didn’t know if the ligation succeeded. This is why we picked up 20 colonies and cultivated them overnight, hoping that one of these had the correct plasmid. The plate containing DH5-α transformed with Seq6 also had a lot of colonies, as expected.
Liquid culture of DH5-α with Seq6 We cultivated 2 different colonies in 250 mL Erlenmeyer containing:
25 mL LB medium
25 μL carbenicillin (25 mg/mL)
We cultivated it overnight in a shaking incubator at 37°C, 180 rpm. (See here the liquid culture protocol)
Liquid culture of Stellar transformed with pBR322-Seq8 We cultivated 20 different colonies in order to maximize our chance to get one successful ligated plasmid. Each colony was cultivated in a 15 mL Falcon tube containing:
5 mL LB medium
5 μL carbenicillin (25 mg/mL)
We cultivated it overnight in a shaking incubator at 37°C, 180 rpm. We also cultivated each colony on petri dishes LB agar plate supplemented with carbenicillin overnight at 37°C.
Transformation of Seq3 from Eurofins Genomics and commercial pET43.1a Material:
LB agar plate supplemented with carbenicillin
Seq3 : NGF-GFP Part1 : 4.0 μg
pET 43.1a : 0.5 μg/μL
Sequence from Eurofins Genomics under the form of lyophilized powder so we need to re-suspend it.
Centrifuge in order to make sure that all the plasmids are at the bottom of the tube and not in the lid.
Re-suspend the powder in TE 1X.  We resuspended it into 400 μL TE, in order to obtain a concentration of 10 ng/μL.
Transformation of the plasmids in DH5α competent cells:
volume of competent cells: 50 μL
pET 43.1a: 50 pg (1 μL of commercial plasmid diluted 1/10000)
Seq3 : 10 ng (1 μL)

We went to see our cultures:
Figure 5:
All the colonies of our ligation (pBR322 + Seq8) grew except one.
DH5α transformed with Seq3 grew.
DH5α transformed with pET 43.1a did not grow.
Hypothesis:
We might have diluted the plasmid or the bacteria too much.
We did not homogenize the solution enough during the dilution of the commercial solution.
We did not pipet correctly the 1 μL of plasmid from the commercial tube.

We chose to verify which colony had acquired the plasmid containing the Seq8 insert. To do so, we digested the plasmid with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI and ran a 1% agarose gel. The size of the plasmid pBR322 is 4361 bp. Once we cut the sequence between the sites EcoRI (bp position 4359) and PstI (bp position 3611), this leaves us with an empty backbone of 3613 bp. The size of the insert Seq8 is 461 bp. Here we made a mistake, by confusing the right restriction enzymes to use. Indeed, we should have used XbaI and SpeI instead of EcoRI and PstI. Moreover, as these two restriction sites are present in the pBR322 backbone (748 bp away), this digestion should show two DNA fragments.
1% Agarose gel of the miniprep of the ligated plasmid (pBR322 + Seq8) from Stellar Only the first half of the samples (1 to 11) were deposed today. The preparation of the gel was done according to the Agarose Gel Preparation protocol. The samples were made according to the following proportions:
5 µL DNA
3 µL 10X Cutsmart Buffer
1 µL EcoRI
1 µL PstI
20 µL H2O
These samples were then incubated for 10 min at 37°C to allow digestion by the enzymes. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 6 µL of 6X Loading Dye. Results:
Figure 6:
/br>
This resulting gel shows the two DNA fragments we expected. Moreover, the column 3 shows a lower molecular weight (MW) than others for the plasmid part. As this part is supposed to contain our insert, it might suggest that colony 3 doesn’t possess the insert, but all others do. However, we will need to make the right experiment using restriction enzymes XbaI and SpeI (see date 08.02.2018) to verify that our insert was correctly put into the plasmid.

Inactivate the digestion by heating the mixture in a heat block at 80 °C for 20 min.
Electrophoresis on agarose gel We prepared an 0.8 % agarose gel to separate the different fragments of the cut plasmids. (See here the Agarose Gel Preparation protocol) We filled:
2 wells with digested pET43.1a (n°1 and n°2)
2 wells with insert Seq1 (n°3 and n°4)
2 wells with insert Seq2 (n°5 and n°6)
1 well with the DNA ladder
We let the DNA migrate for 10 minutes at 85 V on order to let the DNA penetrate the gel, and then 40 min at 125 V to efficiently separate the fragments. We then revealed the gel under UV lamp.
Figure 7: Electrophoresis gel 0.8% (1. 2. pET43.1a / 3. 4. Seq1 / 5. 6. Seq2) before DNA extraction
Interpretations:
pET43.1a (7275 bp) has been successfully linearized into two fragments (5 kb and 2 kb)
pEXA258 – Seq1 from Eurofins Genomics has also been successfully digested. We obtained two fragments corresponding to our insert (1105 bp) and the linearized plasmid (2446 bp)
pEXA258 – Seq2 from Eurofins Genomics has also been successfully digested. We obtained two fragments corresponding to our insert (1159 bp) and the linearized plasmid (2446 bp)

Conductivity tests on membranes assembled on chips. Well chips not functional: tension is applied on top of the membrane, but no current flow is detected. We conclude from that, that the current can't pass from one side of the gold-coated membrane to the other. It was decided for the well chips to stop using silver paste for connecting the platinum wire to the membrane and instead mount the wire on top of the membrane.
Bonding of the vertical chip PDMS pieces failed.

In the well 14 we can clearly see the ladder. Interpretations: The streaks observed on the gel are probably due to the genomic DNA contamination.

Observations: The 6 samples are linearized and migrated exactly like the plasmid pBR322 + Enzyme. Moreover, sample 6 without enzyme migrated like pBR322 without enzyme. Interpretations: This leads to the conclusion that none of the colonies were transformed with the plasmid AND the insert.
Liquid culture of pET43.1a + Seq1 + Seq2 (See here the liquid culture protocol) 8 colonies from the petri dish (pET43.1a + Seq1,2 from 08.01.2018) were placed in a liquid culture containing:

We digested 8 samples of our cloning products, and we also did some controls:
Colony 8 with no enzyme (well 8)
Two colonies from the negative control of the cloning with enzyme
We filled the wells with:
Plasmid extracted from colonies 1 to 8 and digested with NdeI (n°1 to n°8)
Plasmid extracted from the negative control digested with NdeI (n°9 and n°10)
Plasmid extracted from colony 8 without enzyme (n°11)
Results:
Interpretations: We observed only one fragment for all the digested plasmids, and all the fragments have the same molecular weight as the negative control (vector without insert). Cloning did not work again. We assume that the failure might be:
A too low initial amount of linearized vector before cloning, resulting in all the Stellar bacteria being transformed with an empty and uncut vector.
Too long overlaps, or too GC rich overlaps.
Digestion of pBR322, PET 43.1, AND PLASMIDS CONTAINING Seq1, Seq2 and Seq8 We plan to try cloning again with longer digestion and longer electrophoresis migration, in order to digest all the vector and to increase the efficiency of our separation. Reagents:

Incubation time at 37°C : 1 hour Inactivation time at 80°C : 20 min After digestion, we added 8 μL 6X Loading dye to each tube.
Electrophoresis on agarose gel< We prepared a 0.8% agarose gel in order to separate the different fragments of the cut plasmids. (See here the Agarose Gel Preparation protocol) We filled:
2 wells with digested pBR322 (n°1 and n°2)
2 wells with digested pET 43.1a (n°3 and n°4)
2 wells with insert Seq1 (n°5 and n°6)
2 wells with insert Seq2 (n°7 and n°8)
2 wells with insert Seq8 (n°9 and n°10)
We let the DNA migrate for 10 min at 85 V on order to let the DNA penetrate the gel, and then 80 min at 125 V to efficiently separate the fragments. We then revealed the gel under UV lamp. Results: DNA Gel extraction We cut the gel to extract our inserts and linearized plasmid: (See here the  Gel Extraction protocol) Results: After extracting the DNA from the gel, we measured the DNA concentration using the Nanodrop.

Interpretations: Values of the ratio Abs(260 nm)/Abs(280 nm) are very high, indicating that our DNA is highly contaminated. Moreover, the concentrations obtained are too low for further use for cloning. We have several hypotheses to explain why our experiment did not work:
The Gel extraction kit we used might be expired (particularly the final buffer with which we elute DNA might have turned unusable)
We need to check the wavelength of the nanodrop
We are going to try the digestion and extraction again tomorrow in order to try having better concentrations before proceeding to cloning.
08.09.2018
The digestion and extraction of yesterday did not work well (the obtained concentrations of plasmid and insert were still too low to proceed to the cloning step with a suitable volume). Today, we will proceed again with the digestion, extraction and then try the cloning again, using this time the right amount of insert and vector (as recommended by Clontech molar ratio tool) and following the pieces of advice given to us by Takara Clontech technician we called.

Well 13: pET 43.1 negative control
We let the DNA migrate for 10 minutes at 85 V and then 40 minutes at 125 V. Results:
Remark: Date shift -2 days on photograph Interpretations:
For pBR322 + Seq8: On lanes corresponding to Col 1,3,4,5,6 two bands are clearly visible. One at 4 kb and another one at 1 kb, meaning that the plasmid digested by NdeI contained the insert Seq8. One band is visible on lane 2, Col 2 did not contain the insert. The control on lane 7 shows the plasmid digested without the insert at a higher molecular weight. The cloning worked for this construction, because bands observed between 700 bp and 1000 bp.
For pET43.1a + Seq1 + Seq2: From lanes 8 to 11, only one band is visible, and bands are visible at the same molecular weight as the control one (pET43.1a w/o insert and digested with NdeI). On lane 12, the band is lightly lower than the others but no other band corresponding to an insert is visible on lane 12. The cloning did not work for this construction.
Liquid culture pET43.1a + Seq1 + Seq2 and pBR322 + Seq8 Colonies transformed with pET43.1a+Seq1+Seq2 (Colonies 7 to 25) were cultured in 5 mL LB media + 5 µL carbenicillin each (50 mg/mL) Two culture of pBR322+ Seq8 (Col 3 and Col 4) were cultured in 25 mL LB media + 25 µl carbenicillin each (50 mg/mL) (See here the Liquid Culture protocol)

Electrophoresis on agarose gel We prepared a 1 % agarose gel in order to separate the different fragments of the cut plasmids. (See here the Agarose Gel Preparation protocol) We filled:
2 wells with digested pET43.1a  (n°1 and n°2)
10 wells with digested pET43.1a with NdeI (n°4 until n°13)
We let the DNA migrate for 10 min at 85 V on order to let the DNA penetrate the gel, and then 80 min at 125 V to efficiently separate the fragments. We then revealed the gel under UV lamp. Results of the agarose gel after migration:
Figure 4: Agarose gel 1% after electrophoresis of digested pBR322, pET43.1a, Seq1, Seq2 and Seq8.
Interpretations:
pET43.1a has correctly been cut/linearized (lane 1 and 2). It was excised from the gel and extracted using Quiaquick Gel extraction kit.
pET43.1a+ Seq1+Seq2 cloning worked successfully on these colonies. We observed two bands as expected: one at ~ 6-7 kb and one at 1 kb.
We choose to do a Midiprep with sample 10 and 11 in order to have enough DNA for preparing samples for sequencing. We also transformed sample 11 in BL21(DE3) pLysS, our chassis. Results from Nanodrop for pET43.1a

Sample 1,3,8 from Col 3 and sample 3,5,6 from Col 4 are kept for future sequencing. The other samples are thrown away. However, the concentrations are too low. Samples are put in liquid culture again for new DNA extraction. The low concentrations can be due to a problem during the centrifugation steps, or to a too slow manipulation.

Inactivate the digestion by heating the mixture in a water bath at 80 °C for 20 min.
Electrophoresis on agarose gel We prepared a 0.8% agarose gel to separate the different fragments of the cut plasmids. (See here the Agarose Gel Preparation protocol) We filled:
2 wells with digested pET43.1a (n°3 and n°4)
2 wells with digested Seq3 (n°6 and n°7)
2 wells with digested Seq4 (n°9 and n°10)
We let the DNA migrate for 8 min at 85 V on order to let the DNA penetrate the gel, and then 65 min at 125 V to efficiently separate the fragments. We then revealed the gel under UV lamp.
Interpretations:
pET43.1a has not correctly been cut/linearized (lane 3 and 4). It was not excised from the gel and not extracted using Quiaquick Gel extraction kit.
Seq3 has correctly been cut/linearized (lane 3 and 4). It was excised from the gel and extracted using Quiaquick Gel extraction kit.
Seq4 has not correctly been cut/linearized (lane 3 and 4). It was not excised from the gel and not extracted using Quiaquick Gel extraction kit.

Conductivity measurements of  2 gold-membrane PDMS well chips. Function generator was set on sine. The physical quantities measured here are Eg, the generator's tension amplitude and Ep, the voltage difference between the extremity of the platinum wire outside the well chip and a point on the edge of the membrane of the chip. the quantity calculated here is 20*log(Ep/Eg) for different frequencies.
Results
Figure 1: Gold-coated membrane conductivity for different frequencies
Interpretation
Voltage difference calculated is very low, indicating a very good conductivity for the gold-coated membrane. Technically, we measured the conductivity of the system membrane+platinum wire, but we showed that the wire's conductivity could be neglected. Resistance increases in higher frequencies, because of the skin-effect in metals: it transforms into an antenna. But as we are going to use only low frequencies, this doesn't affect us.

Electrophoresis on agarose gel PBR322 + Seq5 + Seq6 + Seq7 We prepared a 1% agar gel. (See here the Agarose Gel Preparation protocol) We let the gel run for 10 min at 85 V and 80min at 125 V. Observations: Digested DNA from colonies migrated to the same molecular weight as the control one. No expecting fragments are visible representing a digestion of our construction with BamHI. None of the colonies contain the final construction. The cloning did not succeed.

BL21 – NGF culture and protein induction Yesterday’s preculture was centrifuged at 4500 x g for 15 minutes. Supernatant was discarded and pellet was washed with 5 mL fresh sterile LB medium.  We centrifuged again for 10 minutes at 4500 x g and supernatant was discarded. Pellet was resuspended in 10 mL LB medium + 10 μL carbenicillin and 10 μL chloramphenicol. From this suspension, three liquid culture were launched in three 250 mL sterile Erlenmeyer. Each Erlenmeyer contains:
35 mL LB medium
35 μL carbenicillin
35 μL chloramphenicol
1 mL resuspended pellet
The Erlenmeyers are incubated in a shaking incubator at 37 °C and DO is followed to induce protein expression when bacteria are in exponential growth phase. At t = 80 min, when OD reaches 0.7, synthesis of the secretion system and NGF is induced by adding IPTG. (See here the IPTG Induction of protein expression protocol) Different IPTG concentrations are tested:
Erlen 1 : 0.1 mM
Erlen 2 : 0.5 mM
Erlen 3 : 1 mM
The Erlenmeyer are incubated again, DO is measured every hour for two hours. Two hours after induction, cultures are stopped and 1 mL of each culture is pipetted and put in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Tubes are centrifuged, and pellet and supernatant are conserved separately.
Analysis of protein expression We analyzed the protein present in the supernatant and in the cytoplasm of induced cells by SDS-Page gel. (See here the SDS-PAGE protocol) The wells were filled as following:
Culture medium before induction
Uninduced supernatant
Uninduced pellet
Culture medium after 0.1 mM induction
Supernatant after 0.1 mM induction
Pellet after 0.1 mM induction
Culture medium after 0.5 mM induction

SDS-PAGE of the collected fractions & Western blot for NGF production analysis This SDS-PAGE didn’t give satisfying results. There was a misunderstanding of the purification protocol as we had let the charging of the column go on over the weekend, which led to the emptying of the nickel from the column.

Bacterial cultures placed at 15°C did not grow up on the four-hour period compared to the one a 37°C. Once placed at 37°C all bacterial cultures grown up again even if it is only slightly for the ones placed at 15°C and 4°C. We supposed the Kill switch has a bacteriostatic effect. We will perform another test with a positive control and different temperatures.

Transfer and immunodetection on membrane of the SDS-PAGE Gel from the 08.29.18 (See here the Gel Transfer for Western Blotting protocol) Results:
Figure 8: SDS-PAGE Gel
At around 33 kDa, one band more intense seems to be the NGF. The result of this Western Blot is not very clear. Yet, there seems to be a band at 33 kDa in moleculrar weight (MW) (which is the size of un-cleaved proNGF with the signal sequence HLYA). Several other bands of upper and lower MW bands are also visible. To confirm that the expression of recombinant proNGF is effective, this band along with a set of lower MW ones will be studied by Mass Spectrometry as shown below. If confirmed, this will mean that our NGF is not retained on the Ni-NTA column for an unknown reason, and that our proNGF is not cleaved from the signal peptide by the TEV protease. Presence of proNGF in lower bands might mean that the signal is cleaved, or that the full length protein has suffered from protease attack.

8 double membrane microchannel chips have been bonded to imaging dishes and sterilized by exposure to UV rays. Leaks made this a difficult and time-consuming operation. 8 microchannel chips have been made.
Scanning electron microscopy (FEI Magellan 400 microscope) of a bare alumina oxide membrane and a PEDOT:PSS-coated one.
Results
Figure 2: bare alumina oxide membrane
Figure 3: PEDOT:PSS-coated alumina oxide membrane
Interpretation
Bare alumina oxide membrane imaging confirmed the presence of 0.2 micrometer pores on the surface, enough to confine bacteria like E. coli. PEDOT:PSS-coated membrane revealed cluster-like formation of PEDOT:PSS deposits. It is thought that the lack of uniformity of the coating won't give the expected results in matters of biocompatibility and conductivity.

Kill Switch test plates observations Results:
Figure 3: Results table
Bacterial culture placed at 20°C over-weekend and spread on plate placed at 37°C formed a mat, i.e. completely covered the plate, for either the Kill-Switch and controls. However, when they were placed at room temperature (RT), the positive control formed a mat whilst the one containing the Kill-Switch formed small colonies (58 CFU) at D+1. Cultures placed at 37°C over the week-end and incubated either at RT and 37°C grew as a mat. However, on the one containing the Kill-Switch less colonies grew. We counted 125 colonies at 1/50 dilution.

Electric measurements on 4 remaining chips
Stimulation and measure of the electric signal at the interface of the neuronal system and the conductive membrane using an oscilloscope and a low frequency generator.
Materials: -Vertical chip with PEDOT:Ts membrane (see here the Membrane PEDOT:Ts and PEDOT:Cl coating protocol) seeded with neurons and filled with culture medium (see here the Seeding neurons into the microfluidic chip protocol). -Function generator (GW Intstek SFG-2010) -Oscilloscope (Tektronix TBS 2000 Series) -Phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS)
Procedure: The goal is to measure the output of nerves in presence of a membrane by subjecting them to an electric signal.  Function generator is set on sine mode, 240 mV at 50 Hz. The two wires are connected to the silver paste spots on the bottom of the imaging dish and between the two layers of PDMS composing the chip to allow the current to pass through the system. An oscilloscope is then connected to these spots as well. First measurements indicate that the input signal is not being transmitted at all (Figure 1) by the system neurons + membrane, suggesting something is not working well in the setup.
Figure 1
It is hypothesized, the ions in the culture medium might be perturbing the measure, so the decision is taken to remove the culture medium from the chip. The result is the same (Figure 2).
Figure 2
The chip is then washed with PBS 1X and another measurement is made. Results remained the same (Figure 3).
Figure 3
Results: Results: It can be concluded from this experiment, that testing the electric conductivity of the system neurons + membrane is harder than expected and might indicate the need for more precautions and more rigorous methods of measurement.

Batch purification of 6xHIS-tagged proNGF (Seq1,2) with Ni-NTA beads under native and partial denatured conditions. Aim: Purify the proNGF under both native and partial denatured form to study whether the His-tag is accessible for Ni-NTA purification. We already tried on Ni-NTA column without any  retention of our His-tagged protein on the column. Material:
2 x 200 µl Ni-NTA beads (100 µl beads)
Buffer A (Tris 20 mM, pH 8, NaCl 200 mM) and Buffer U (Tris 20 mM, pH 8, NaCl 200 mM, Urea 2M)
Under native conditions, work at 4°C, under partial denatured work at room temperature (RT). Ni-NTA beads were equilibrated with 4 volumes of beads (Buffer A or U), centrifuged for 5 min at 500 x g, two times. One volume of protein solution was added and allowed to bind for 1 hour at 4°C or RT. Beads were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 x g and an aliquot was taken. Beads were washed 4 times with 4 volumes of buffer containing 20 mM Imidazole. One volume of elution buffer (Imidazole 250 mM) was added and allowed to stand for 10 min. Centrifugation allow to get back the supernatant containing purified proteins. Addition of loading buffer and heat the sample at 95°C for 5 min. Sample were loaded on 2 Bis-tris 12% gel. One gel was stained with E/Z blue staining. The other gel was transferred on to a nitrocellulose membrane and stored in PBS at 4°C.

Immunodetection of His-tagged proNGF
(See here the Immunodetection on membrane protocol)
We performed batch purification using NiNTA beads under native and partial denaturing conditions (Urea 2 M) followed by Western Blot analysis with immunodetection through Anti-His Antibodies Alexa Fluor 647. (Figure 10) Detection of His-tag in the pellet supernatant of induced BL21 with 1 mM IPTG and flow through when partially denatured. His-tagged proNGF was not retained on NiNTA beads. N-terminal His tag may be hidden in the protein fold. Consequently, we did not manage to purify the proNGF.

Membrane microchannel chip bacteria confinement experiment. Optical density measure of a sample of liquid culture. Liquid culture was poured in a microchannel chip on one side, and optical density of the liquid that flowed to the other side of the microchannnels was measured.
Results
Liquid culture OD: 0.44
OD of liquid after flowing through the chip: 0.41.
Interpretation
We expected a much lower OD after liquid flow through the chip, so this suggests the presence of a leak in the chip, that allows the liquid culture to flow without retaining the bacteria. The decision was taken to investigate further and to observe the flow under a microscope.

Measurement of the membrane's electrical resistance without biofilm.
Results: membrane conductivity
Function generator was set on square at 200 Hz.  The physical quantities measured are Eg, the generator tension amplitude, and Ep, the amplitude of the voltage difference between a point on the membrane inside the well and the extremity of the platinium strip outside the well. Tension amplitude of the resistor is given by Er = Eg - Ep. Current flowing through the electric circuit is calculated with I = Er/R. Conductivity of the membrane is given by I/Ep. Conductivity of each membrane was measured 3 times. Figure 1 shows the mean value for each membrane and the standard deviation.
Figure 1: Membrane conductivity
Interpretation
Bare alumina oxide and PEDOT:PSS-coated membranes show similar conductivies, indicating the incomplete coating of PEDOT:PSS on alumina oxide membranes. On the opposite, PEDOT:Cl and PEDOT:Ts seem to exhibit on average better conductivities, but in the same time, the coating of these membranes revealed by electron microscopy seemed to have covered the alumina oxide membranes in a more uniform way, assuring enhanced conductive capabilities. These results can be criticized because of the high deviation and because the membranes conductivity was measured after several biofilms were grown on them, which may have affected the measurements.

Measurement of the electrical resistance of the membranes with the biofilm.
Second try of the confinement experiment of bacteria with a membrane microchannel chip.  A few drops of RFP expressing DH5alpha E. coli liquid culture were poured in a membrane microchannel chip. Chip was then observed under a microscope.
Results: confinement experiment
Figure 2: Second confinement test
Interpretation
Membrane is located on the right side, and liquid culture was poured on that side, before the membrane. Bacteria was still able to flow to the left side, but they were not following the microchannels, instead they were just flowing in a single direction, suggesting the membrane lifts the microfluidic chip from below and thus causes massive leakings in the microfluidic circuitry. We concluded that the microchannel chips we designed didn't really meet the requirements they were designed for.
Results: biofilm growth
Biofilm growth was measured 4 times in total. For each series of measure, the measured optical densities were divided by the optical density of the base liquid culture, to normalize the measures. Figure 2 shows the mean value for each type of membrane and the standard deviation.
Figure 3: Biofilm growth
Results: biofilm conductivity
For conductivity measurements, function generator was set on square at 200 Hz. The physical quantities measured are Eg, the generator tension amplitude, and Ep, the amplitude of the voltage difference between a point on the biofilm inside the well and the extremity of the platinium strip outside the well. Tension amplitude of the resistor is given by Er = Eg - Ep. Current flowing through the electric circuit is calculated with I = Er/R. Conductivity of the membrane is given by I/Ep. Conductivity of each membrane with a biofilm was repeated 3 times. Figure 4 shows the average conductivity of the membrane with the biofilm, and the standard deviation.
Figure 4: Membrane conductivity with biofilm
To approximate very roughly the conductivity of the biofilm, the average conductivity values of the membranes with a biofilm were divided by the corresponding average biofilm growth values, and the conductivity of the membrane was then substracted. Figure 4 shows the estimated biofilm conductivity.
Figure 5: Biofilm conductivity
Interpretation
As told by the membrane manufacturer, biofilm formation on gold membranes seems indeed to be more difficult than on other membranes. However we expected PEDOT:PSS-coated membranes to stimulate more the growth of biofilm, but perhaps that may be just another indicator of the incomplete coating. Surprisingly, PEDOT:Cl tends to allow better formation of biofilms. We realized only after the experiments the need for a control biofilm culture without membrane.
Conductivity with a biofilm is better with gold membranes, although the conductivity of gold membranes themselves isn't the best. This may be explained by the fact, that because of the thinner biofilm formation on gold membranes, the electrical wires touched not only the biofilm, but also the membrane, bypassing the biofilm and leading to imprecise measurements.
Approximate biofilm conductivity is therefore probably wrong for the gold membrane. However, it is interesting to notice that the biofilm conductivity measured for the bare alumina oxyde, PEDOT:Ts-coated one and PEDOT:PSS-coated give more or less the same value, suggesting that with more measurements, adapted equipement and better methods it would be indeed possible to measure the biofilm's conductivity with our PDMS well chips.

Third and last try of the confinement experiment of bacteria with a membrane microchannel chip.  A few drops of E. coli liquid culture were poured in a membrane microchannel chip. Chip was then observed under a microscope.
Results: confinement experiment
Figure 6: Third confinement test
Interpretation
Membrane is located on the left side, and liquid culture was poured on that side, before the membrane. Bacteria this time wasn't able to flow to the right side, the membrane stopped their progression. It is clear on figure 6, that the left side is crowded with bacteria, and the right side is empty (apart from a few PDMS impurities). Final conclusion on the membrane microchannel chips is, that although the integration method of the membrane filter in the chip is complicated and a bit improvised, some chips apparently do fulfill their purpose, demonstrating this way the confinement of the bacteria with a membrane.
