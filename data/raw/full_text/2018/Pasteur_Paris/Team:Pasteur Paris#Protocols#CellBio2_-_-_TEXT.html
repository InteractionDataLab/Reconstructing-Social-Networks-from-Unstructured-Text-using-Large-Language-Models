Drain water with aspiration system (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Order without creation of flow
Add 50 µL of 10 µg/mL Poly-L-Lysine (PLL) into the top wells and allow the flow through (Figure 2a). After 5 minutes, fill the bottom wells (Figure 2b). Place the device in an incubator overnight at 37◦C.

Drain the device with aspiration system (Figure 1), and rinse with 30 µL of PBS 1X to wash out the excess fluid of PLL. Add 20 µL of 1mg/mL laminin into the top wells only (Figure 2a). Place the device containing laminin in an incubator at 37◦C for a minimum of 2 hours.

Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium 1X (DMEM) (Fisher Scientific, ref : 21969-035500ML)
Procedure
According to BrainBits protocol .
Prepare cell dissociation solution by dissolving 6 mg sterile of papain in 3mL of Hibernate E-Ca for a final working concentration of 2 mg/mL papain. Incubate for 10 minutes at 30◦C. Then, carefully transfer and save Hibernate EB solution to a sterile tube leaving the tissue with minimal Hibernate EB volume. Add 2 mL of cell dissociation solution to the tissue and incubate for 10 minutes at 30◦C, gently swirl every 5 minutes. Carefully remove cell dissociation solution and return the saved Hibernate EB medium. Fire polish the tip of a sterilized Pasteur pipette to an opening of about 5 mm. With this pipette, triturate tissue for about 1 minute and let undispersed pieces settle for 1 minute. Then, transfer supernatant containing dispersed cells to a sterile 15mL, leave about 50 µL of Hibernate EB solution containing debris. Spin 1100 rpm for 1 minute, and discard supernatant leaving 50 µL of Hibernate EB solution containing the pellet. Resuspend pellet in 1mL of appropriate cell culture medium.

Trypan blue solution cell culture (Sigma-Aldrich, ref : T8154-20ML)
Procedure
Transfer 10 µL of cell solution into the tube containing 10 µL of Trypan Blue. Place 10 µL of the suspension in the Neubauer chamber. Count all the cells that are not colored in blue in the center square of the chamber, about 0.1 µL. The cellular concentration is determined by the total number of cells in 0.1 µL multiply by 10,000. Then, multiply the result by the dilution realized with the Trypan Blue.

For the microfluidic chip seeding, tilt the tip in the direction of the chamber in order to help the migration of the neurons. Incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature, and add 50 µL of appropriate cell culture medium at 37◦C (Figure 1). The culture medium needs to be prepare at least 1 hour before. Add about 1 mL of EDTA around the chip to avoid contamination and prevent evaporation. Then, incubate the device at 37◦C with 5% CO2. Change half of the volume of the medium every 3-4 days, use a P1000 pipette and not the aspiration system.

Then, drain with the aspiration system (Figure 1), and block with 50 µL of solution D for 30 minutes at room temperature. Prepare in 1X PBS, 500X anti MAP2 antibody coupled with Alexa Fluor 555nm and 500X anti-β-tubulin antibody coupled with Alexa Fluor 448 nm. Drain with the aspiration system (Figure 1), and drop 20 µL of the suspension on the top wells (Figure 3) and incubate 1 hour at room temperature in the dark. Then, drain with the aspiration system (Figure 1), and wash with 1X PBS and store at 4◦C for futur fluorescent microscopic analysis.
