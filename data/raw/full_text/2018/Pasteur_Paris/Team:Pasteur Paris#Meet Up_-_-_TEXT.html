iGEM Pasteur Paris 4th Annual Parisian Meetup
For the 4th time since the creation of the iGEM Pasteur team, we hosted the annual Parisian Meetup. Despite its name, all iGEM teams from France (Aix-Marseille Université, Bordeaux, Evry_Paris-Saclay, GO_Paris-Saclay, Grenoble-Alpes, Montpellier, Paris_Bettencourt, Sorbonne_U_Paris and Toulouse-INSA-UPS) participated.
Every team presented their project in 20 minutes followed by questions and comments from the judges and the audience. The essence of the Meetup was to get feedback and constructive criticism on the projects from the judges. In the judging committee, we had:
Pascale DUPUIS-WILLIAMS, researcher at the INSERM (Medical Research Institute in France) and Professor of Cellular Biology at the ESPCI (Ecole Supérieure de Physique et Chimie Industrielles, de la ville de Paris).
Jonathan KELLER, lawyer and legal consultant in charge of intellectual property and Open Science at La Paillasse.
Deshmukh GOPAUL, researcher in Biochemistry at the Institut Pasteur and head Design for Biology Center - Education Department.

After a homemade lunch, very much appreciated by the French teams, we also organized round tables about bioethics, and also how regulations may be a restraint to innovation. We had the great pleasure to welcome:
M. Pascal Boireau, on micro-organisms ranked for bioterrorism, GMO and dual research
M. Didier Coeurnelle, on the ethics of experiments linked to the end of life
Mme Valérie Dépadt, on medically assisted procreation
M. Térence Ericson, on Artificial Intelligence and genetic modification
M. Deshmukh Gopaul, on ethical problems raised by the projects of the iGEM French teams
M. Alexei Grinbaum, on the responsibility of the researchers and use of stories to think about ethical questions
Mme Joanna Trouchaud, on the use of animal models in research
And our special guest, Will Wright, the Europeen Ambassador of iGEM, also presented and talked to the teams on the experience of iGEM and After iGEM.
To illustrate this day, we had the pleasure to host Nais Coq , a science and event illustration artist. You can find all her drawings on our Twitter account under the #parisianmeetup #iGEM2018 #drawiGEM . After a Ph.D. in Physical fluids and a short Post-Doc, she decided to come back to her true passion, drawing, and started her career in illustration and scientific drawing.

iGEM Aix Marseille Université – Summer Mediterranean MeetUp
Organized by the iGEM Aix Marseille Université team, the summer Mediterranean MeetUp took place in the CNRS lab of Marseille, gathering 8 French teams and two Spanish teams. On Thursday, the event started with a 180 second presentation of the projects, followed by questions by the Jury. Unfortunately, the weather changed the afternoon plans, instead of visiting Marseille under the hail, we got to know each other around card games. On Friday we attended a round table on bioethics to question the risks of our project. We also had the chance to meet the Ambassador Thea Chrysostomou and discuss with her about our project. In the afternoon, we presented our project to various researchers during the poster session. It was a very interesting and challenging task.
All in all, it was a great opportunity to meet new teams and to discuss with teams that came to our meetup, about the improvement each team had made over the summer. We managed to discuss with other iGEMers and to share tips between teams in a friendly atmosphere.

iGEM UCLouvain – Biotech4Change (European Commission Biotech Event)
We participated to the Biotech4Change conference in the European Parliament in Brussels where biotech speakers were present. We met other iGEM teams and presented our project in 3 minutes under a TedX format! Then, international renowned researchers who launched their biotech start up spoke about their background and professional journeys.
