Heating block
Water bath
UV light box, equipped with blue diodes (long wavelength)
Procedure
According to the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit's manual
Using a UV light, excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
Weigh the gel slice in an Eppendorf tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg ~ 100 μl).
Incubate at 50°C for 10 minutes (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). To help dissolve the gel, mix by vortexing the tube every 2 to 3 minutes during the incubation.

Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 50 μl of Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or H2O to the centre of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 minute at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g).
