PROTOCOLS & EXPERIMENTS
PROTOCOLS
Microfluidics
PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) is a widely used polymer in microfluidics, for its biocompatibility and transparence, among other qualities. Here we show how to prepare PDMS for microfluidic chips, as well as how to demold them, bond them to other surfaces and treat them for neuron growth. Also, we explain how our molds and chips were fabricated.
PDMS Chips Fabrication
PDMS Chip Demolding
PDMS Chip Bonding
Materials
Sylgard 184 Elastomer Kit  (Sigma-aldrich, Sylgard 184, 761036-5EA)
Vacuum pump unit (Vacuubrand PC 3 RZ 2.5)
Stove (Memmert UM 400)
Protocol
According to manufacturer's instruction .
Mix monomer and curing agent (10:1 proportion) for 30 seconds
Use a vacuum pump unit and a  vacuum bell jar to extract air bubbles until the mixture is clear
Pour mixture onto mold
Put mixture+mold in stove at 70 degrees Celsius for 3 hours

Isopropanol (Fisherbrand, CAS number 67-63-0)
Office duct tape
Vertical laminar airflow cabinets (Euroclone aura vertical S.D.4)
Protocol
Take chip and the surface it needs to be bonded to in the airflow cabinet
Clean chip with duct tape and isopropanol
Put the chip and the surface into the plasma cleaner.
Expose chip and surface 30 seconds to plasma.
Take the chip and the surface back in the airflow cabinet
Press the microfluidic chip against the surface
Insert distilled water into chip circuitry
