Our experience at the 2018 Giant Jamboree
Medal
At the end of October 2018, our team attended the 2018 Giant Jamboree of the iGEM competition in Boston. We presented our project with a presentation, a poster and our 3D printed model. We have been astonished and filled with joy by both juries and iGEMers reactions to NeuronArch as they showed great interest for it and were very impressed by our work!
Award
We were nominated for Best Product Design in the Overgrad category.
