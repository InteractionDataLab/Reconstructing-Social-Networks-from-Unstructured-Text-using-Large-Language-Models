Founded by the City of Paris in 1882, for over a century the School has attracted leading scientific innovators like Nobel Prize laureates Pierre and Marie Curie, Paul Langevin, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, and Georges Charpak, who continue to contribute to the institution’s international reputation. Ever since it was founded, ESPCI Paris has been gaining in prestige and status. Evolving from a municipal school established to train industrial production managers, it has achieved the status of a major institute of higher education in science and engineering, which recruits students via the most selective competitive examination in France.
Institut Curie - IPGG
Recognized public interest foundation, the Institut Curie has worked to fulfill its three missions since its founding by Marie Curie, namely research, care and preservation and transfer of knowledge. This multi-disciplinary approach, part of the bylaws of the foundation, is the DNA of Institut Curie. The laboratory Macromolecules and Microsystems in Biology and Medicine of the Institut Curie lent us their mold to create our microfluidic chips, as well as laboratory material. They also let us design and create the chips inside their facility. They are an interdisciplinary group dedicated to the application of physics and chemistry to biology and medicine, with a strong translational component.
