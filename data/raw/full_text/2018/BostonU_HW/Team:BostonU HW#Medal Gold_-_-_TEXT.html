Integrated Human Practices
Throughout our iGEM project, we have interacted with various industry partners and companies, who have provided us with invaluable feedback. We have integrated components from our human practices, resulting in improvements and modifications to our system, TERRA.

Improve Upon a Previous Project
During the course of our 2018 project, we have made improvements to the 2016 iGEM BostonU_HW project, Neptune. Our project, TERRA, incorporates automated syringe pumps that were originally derived from Neptune and modified and improved to control valves in our system.

Model
Our team has created a mathematical model of our system, TERRA, in order to verify its performance and accuracy.

Demonstrate
To demonstrate how our project works, we have created a page that documents the process of running an experiment on TERRA. For a live demonstration, come to our table and watch TERRA in action!
