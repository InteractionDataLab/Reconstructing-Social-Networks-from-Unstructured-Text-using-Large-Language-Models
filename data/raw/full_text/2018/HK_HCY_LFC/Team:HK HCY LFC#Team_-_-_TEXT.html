Our Schools
Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College (HCY) and Po Leung Kuk Laws Foundation College (PLKLFC) are both English as Medium of Instruction (EMI) and co-educational secondary schools in Hong Kong.
Our Team
Our team is composed of F.5 and F.6 students and teachers from HCY and PLKLFC. Students in our team demonstrate different talents and stretch our potential in the iGEM competition.
Our Team Leaders
Marshall, Low Chun Hin
I am a F.5 student from Po Leung Kuk Laws Foundation College in Hong Kong. It is my pleasure to participate in the iGEM competition 2018. I am very excited to have this wonderful opportunity to travel to Boston in October and meet with other teams as well as learning more about biology from professionals of different countries. I am responsible for managing the lab work team in our school. My team designs, modifies and improves our DNA nanostructure through experiments. Throughout the lab sessions, our laboratory skills have been enhanced. Friendship with my schoolmates has also been strengthened. I believe the iGEM competition provides a wonderful experience for me to explore the world of biotechnology and build the friendship with the people in different countries. I am looking forward to the Jamboree in October!
Tiffany, Lam Tsz Yan
I am a F.5 student from Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College. The iGEM competition is the first international synthetic biology competition that I’ve participated in and I'm really excited about the Jamboree with other teams from around the world in Boston in October. I am responsible for the human practice team from our school. Through interacting with the patients as well as spreading the information about SCA on different platforms, I have a more thorough understanding on the situation faced by the rare disease patients are facing. On the other hand, I have gained experimental skills and data-analyzing skills in this investigation. I believe this would be a remarkable experience and I hope our study can help the SCA patients in both the scientific aspect and the social aspect.
Our Teachers
Lau Sui Yee
Dr Lau is our Primary PI, as well as a Biology teacher in Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College. She has facilitated our project since the very beginning. Throughout the whole project, she keeps motivating us patiently when we are discouraged by the experimental results or the heavy workload. She assists us with every affair in this programme, from determining our topic to contacting the advisors from The University of Hong Kong, from fund-raising to planning our trip to Boston. It is very kind of her to do her best in order to make our project perfect despite her busy teaching schedule. We would like to express our greatest appreciation to her.
Cheung Miu Ling
Ms. Cheung is our secondary PI, as well as a Biology teacher in Po Leung Kuk Laws Foundation College. She plays an irreplaceable role in our iGEM project. She has spent countless hours into the lab work, to assure that our team can successfully deliver the results required. She is very meticulous and incredibly efficient during the preparations of the lab work. Furthermore,she is always focused during the experiments to ensure that all experimental results are up to par. Students can always learn from her as she is willing to share knowledge along with skills that are beneficial to our experiments. She is our mentor and we greatly appreciate her help throughout the experiments.
Fung Chi Tuen
Mr. Fung is a Chemistry teacher in Po Leung Kuk Laws Foundation College. He has been supporting our project since the beginning. He has devoted hours and hours of his precious time to guide our team to think deeper. He has been relentlessly assisting our team’s lab work. On top of that, he is responsible of all the administrative works of this Jamboree, making sure that everything can go smoothly during our trip to the U.S.. We would like to show our gratitude towards him for making our trip possible.
Yuen Man Leuk
Dr Yuen is our instructor, a Biology and Chemistry teacher in Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College as well. He enriches our basic biotechnology knowledge by explaining key concepts and giving scientific researches to us from time to time. On the other hand, he approaches various organizations for our human practice work, such as the HKSCAA, Legislative Council member and several media. He often shares his experience on scientific researches with us and it is really beneficial to our investigation. We greatly appreciate his assistance.
