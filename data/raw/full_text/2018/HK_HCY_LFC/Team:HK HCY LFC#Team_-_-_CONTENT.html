                I am a F.5 student from Po Leung Kuk Laws Foundation College in Hong Kong. It is my pleasure to participate in the iGEM competition 2018. I am very excited to have this wonderful opportunity to travel to Boston in October and meet with other teams as well as learning more about biology from professionals of different countries. I am responsible for managing the lab work team in our school. My team designs, modifies and improves our DNA nanostructure through experiments. Throughout the lab sessions, our laboratory skills have been enhanced. Friendship with my schoolmates has also been strengthened. I believe the iGEM competition provides a wonderful experience for me to explore the world of biotechnology and build the friendship with the people in different countries. I am looking forward to the Jamboree in October!

                I am a F.5 student from Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College. The iGEM competition is the first international synthetic biology competition that I’ve participated in and I'm really excited about the Jamboree with other teams from around the world in Boston in October. I am responsible for the human practice team from our school. Through interacting with the patients as well as spreading the information about SCA on different platforms, I have a more thorough understanding on the situation faced by the rare disease patients are facing. On the other hand, I have gained experimental skills and data-analyzing skills in this investigation. I believe this would be a remarkable experience and I hope our study can help the SCA patients in both the scientific aspect and the social aspect.
