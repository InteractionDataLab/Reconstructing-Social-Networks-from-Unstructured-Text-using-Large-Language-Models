Self-assembled DNA Tweezer Nanomachine
In a biosensor, a bioreceptor interacts with the analyte and this interaction will be converted into a                 measurable signal by a transducer.
In our design, a split DNA aptamer is integrated into G-quadruplex tweezers to detect the miRNA 25. It                     is found that comparing with various DNA machine mechanisms, DNA tweezers hold some specific                     advantages for sensing applications as the mechanism does not involve strand displacement and the                     structure is formed from only a small number of single-stranded DNA molecules. [1] Besides, it is                     believed that aptamer-based sensors act as a better sensor comparing to antibodies because they are less                     expensive, more stable than antibodies. Similarly, comparing with antibody-antigen interaction,                     aptamers also show high thermostability and specificity in binding the miRNA 25 through Watson-                     Crick base pairing. [2, 3]
Regarding to reporting system that enables exhibition of results, G-quadruplex, which mediated                     peroxidase activity with hemin can be observed colorimetrically, could be adopted into the tweezer                     well. Therefore, a quadruplex-hemin reporting system is ideal compared to fluorescence as it is                     relatively low-cost and visualizable by eye for potential future diagnostic application in a rapid                     diagnostic device. [4, 5]
Tanner and co-workers demonstrated that a DNA tweezers nanomachine can successfully recognize the                     Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase. In their design, a split DNA aptamer is integrated into                     a G-quadruplex tweezers and closing of the tweezers enables G-quadruplex hemin mediated peroxidase                     activity. [5] A similar nanostructure is designed in our project for the recognition of has-mir 25.
Tiamat, which is a tool to design large and complex DNA nanostructure, is used to design our                     nanostructure [6]. According to figure 1, the nanostructure designed consists of three single strand                     DNA oligos. DNA oligo 1 refers to the longest one in the middle; DNA oligo 2 refers to the one on the                     left while DNA oligo 3 refers to the one on the right. It is showed in figure 2 that DNA oligo 1 consists                     of a split G-quadruplex which is labelled green at both ends; DNA oligo 2 and 3 consists of split                     aptamer which are labelled blue and red respectively. The sequences of each DNA oligo are shown in                     figure 3. The three strands assembled through complementary base pairing in which adenine (A) pairs                     with thymine(T) while guanine(G) pairs with cytosine(C).

Figure 2: Designed DNA nanostructure with sequences of each strand shown. The complementary regions to part of the has-mir 25 are located at the 3’ end of DNA oligo 2 and 5’ end of DNA oligo 3 respectively (labelled blue and red ). The split G-quadruplex is located at both ends of DNA oligo 1 (labelled green)
