Acknowledgment
GUOJUN CHEN
--A cousin of one of our team members, he helped us write the program on Wiki.
QING PAN
--Postdoctor, who gave us many suggestions on lab work and borrow some reagent to us.
JIANZHAO YANG
--Member of 2018 Peking iGEM, he gave us experimental protocol.
ZHONGKANG WANG
--Professor from Chongqing University, he provided manufacturing technique of emulsifiable powder for us and gave us suggestions on our cockroach boxes.
Manager Chen
--Canteen Manager of our school, he gave us experience on killing the cockroaches in daily lives and was willing to test our boxes in the future.
Experiment Module
--This year we designed a system based on Metarhizium anisopliae. In order to finish our experiment, there are three iGEMers taking on the heavy responsibility, Lindong and Mingyue completed the work of plasmid construction, Chen Liang made a great contribution in the transformation. About the verification of the gene, the three members completed the DNA level verification. Chen Liang completed the verification of functional genes at the mRNA level. The three members completed the verification work of the protein detection. At the macro level, the three members performed their duties and completed the verification of three genes.
Human Practice Module
--In order to build a platform for iGEMers to communicate with each other, Jiaqi and Jianting organized a meeting which called Southern China Regional Meeting. They also interviewed an expert of CDC about cockroaches. Besides, Jiaqi, Mingyue and Lindong went to Chongqing University to ask professor Wang Zhongkang to improve our experimental program and product designing. Jiaqi, Jianting and Gefei went to a small village of Hunan province to test our product. Also, Jiaqi, Jianting, Mingyue and Gefei went to Moon bay primary school to the make the popularization of science.
Modeling
Modeling In order to predict the efficiency of our product and help to direct project design, Jinquan constructed a mathematical model with an ordinary differential equation to estimate the population dynamic of cockroaches. What's more, he analysis some experimental data with the statistic model so as to give us a scientific result.
Instruction
Thanks to our soul figure, Weizhao Chen, we can run our team smoothly. He not only gave us suggestion on various parts of the competition but also helped us make a contract with somebody we what. More importantly, we can not finish our project without the sponsor he found. As for Ning Xie, he played a key role in our experiment on both upstream and downstream. He offered us guidance on experiment such as ways of fungal transformant and activity of enzymes measurement. Additionally, he recommended his tutor to us for a better understanding of Metarhizium anisopliae. To make our downstream experiment systematic, he even provided us with a professional factory for fungal fermentation, so that we can cultivate a large number of spores.
