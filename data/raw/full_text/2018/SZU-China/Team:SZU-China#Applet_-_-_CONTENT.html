							Last year, our team came up with a lot of ideas through brainstorming, but when we were about to link our projects to our daily lives, we met the following problems:
						</P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="accordion" style="width: 100%;" id="accordionExample"><DIV class="card"><DIV class="card-header" id="heading1"><H5 class="mb-0"><BUTTON class="btn btn-link" style="color: #3880A0;" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapse1" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapse1">

        </BUTTON></H5></DIV><DIV id="collapse1" class="collapse show" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#accordionExample"><DIV class="card-body">
											We have come up with a lot of ideas in every field, such as bio-battery, waste oil detection, transformation of Metarhizium to kill cockroaches, sewage treatment and so on. But we can't quite determine whether these projects are acceptable to the public, and whether they are actually what they really need. We need to collect information about the public's views on these ideas and to understand the actual needs of the public, and then make a choice.

										</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="card"><DIV class="card-header" id="heading2"><H5 class="mb-0"><BUTTON class="btn btn-link collapsed" style="color: #3880A0;" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapse2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse2">

        </BUTTON></H5></DIV><DIV id="collapse2" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#accordionExample"><DIV class="card-body">
											Among the many participating teams, we also need more feedback from peers and professionals in the topic selection and experimentation. When we have an alternative project, we can't quickly find out if other teams are doing similar work and go through a feasibility study of the project. In the course of our experiments, we can't get timely feedback and suggestions about improvement, which is easy to be limited to our own ideas, causing unnecessary waste of time and energy.

											In China, most people have misconceptions about synthetic biology and genetic modification. Most people think that synthetic biology is harmful and refuse to accept genetically modified products, especially food products. However, there is currently no platform for normal publicity and exposure to synthetic biology in the country. The public has little understanding of synthetic biology, and they naturally contradict this product. In this way, when our project is going to conduct extensive public research, it is also difficult.

        1. We hope this will be the HP platform for iGEMers, providing a platform for online communication and collaboration between teams, and get public participation and feedback for project improvement.

												From the perspective of the entrants, each iGEM team is in the process of conceiving and selecting topics at the beginning of the competition. Compared with traditional cross-regional meetings and exchanges, we hope that each team can communicate more conveniently and on time online, no longer limited by geography and time. Receive feedback and suggestions from within the various IGEM teams to achieve timely sharing and communication.
											</P><P>
												Most iGEM projects are linked to the actual situation, and the details and scope of application need to be adjusted in time during the experiment. This requires timely identification of the group targeted by the project, allowing potential users to participate in our projects. Product experience, testing and feedback from online to offline. We continually correct and adjust our projects based on their feedback.

												For the iGEM team, many of their projects are stopped at iGEM and rarely progressed. The reason may be that the system is not mature enough to find sufficient financial support. We hope that the iGEM team on this platform will be able to find like-minded teammates who also have a deep understanding of certain projects or have professional knowledge. Through the exchanges with teammates who share the same goals, we can improve the project and develop together. At the same time, through our platform, perhaps projects can be favored by potential users and investors. If you have the guidance of a professional entrepreneurial team or support in product development, I believe that there are many projects that can go on and make practical and useful things. We hope to use the platform of the applet to carry out good projects and truly apply synthetic biology to our real life, and also add a force to synthetic biology.

												For many of the more controversial and unpopular research fields, the researchers often do not receive the attention and attention they pay. Synthetic biology is such an area. In China, because the public is more resistant to GM products, the research and the public are almost lost. Researchers often cannot judge whether the results he has worked hard to make are the real needs of the public, or the pseudo-demand he imagines. The lack of public knowledge of synthetic biology further expands the communication barrier between the research team and the public, and thus a large number of scientific research results are not happy or even dare to use. Even more frightening is that social media is full of a large number of pseudo-sciences. Some of them are well-known for their traffic sensationalism, and they are alarmist to promote some wrong scientific knowledge and opinions, which cause great trouble to the public's scientific cognition.
												
											</P><P>
												However, we can use this applet to keep our scientific research projects in a more succinct and easy-to-understand manner while keeping scientific rigor, and let the public better understand what we are doing. The public can participate in the project in time to truly understand the real part of the experiment. This will provide a bridge of communication between researchers and the general public, which will better attract the public to understand and accept the knowledge of synthetic biology. Let synthetic biology researchers get more support and help.

												There are many misunderstandings about transgenic and synthetic biology in China. Synthetic biology like plague is generally feared and evaded. We hope to use some successful projects and cases to carry out scientific popularization of synthetic biology for a large number of potential users. If the public can learn more about synthetic biology, be able to participate in discussions about synthetic biology and give timely feedback, they may change the original idea of resistance to synthetic biology. Therefore, there is more concern and support for the research and exploration of synthetic biology.
