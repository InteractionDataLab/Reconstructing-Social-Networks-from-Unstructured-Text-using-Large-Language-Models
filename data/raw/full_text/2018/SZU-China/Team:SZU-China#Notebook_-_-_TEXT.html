We would like to share with you what we have done for our project monthly.
2017 December
Set up the 2018 SZU-China iGEM team
2018 January
Brainstorm for the team project
2018 February
Determined the subject as cockroach terminator
Experimental skills training for the new team
2018 March
Searched for documents and references about cockroach and Metarhizium anisopliae 128
Communicated with 2018 SUST-iGEM team about some experimental skills
2018 April
Constructed an applicable working plasmid called pBC
2018 May
The first try we transferred our working vector into the wild-type Metarhizium anisopliae 128. However, we failed.
We held a meeting which called iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting, our purpose is to build a plat for iGEMers to communicate.
We empolder an applet which named biocompany after that meeting, it can help iGEMers better communicate with each other, also a good platform for Human Practice.
We Isolated the strain.
We interviewed Canteen manager to ask the impact of cockroaches.
2018 June
We got Metarhizium anisopliae 128
We built a transformation system, but we failed.
We successfully constructed plasmid.
2018 July
We interviewed the CDC to consult about the diseases caused by cockroaches and the killing of cockroaches in the community.
We re-built a transformation system, but we failed again.
We attended the iGEM EurAsian Meetup.
In-depth communication with TU-Delft University in Shenzhen University.
We designed the first generation of the box.
2018 August
We designed the simulation experiment and started to explore.
We went to Chongqing to visit Professor Wang Zhongkang, learned about fungal fermentation engineering, and improved our box.
We improved our box and designed the second generation box.
Attended the 5th CCiC in Shanghai.
2018 September
Built mathematical model.
Designed our posters and uniforms.
Started writing wiki page.
We finally successfully built up a transformation system.
Created the banner.
We went to a village in Hunan to test our products.
We improved our box and designed the third generation box.
2018 October
Finished the improved part.
Finished the Wiki and upload.
Finished the poster.
Finished all the experiments.
2018 iGEM giant jamboree!
