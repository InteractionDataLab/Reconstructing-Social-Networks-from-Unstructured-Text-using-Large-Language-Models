Model
On this page, two mathematical models were constructed to analysis the efficiency of our producet based on simulation and experiment.
Click the frame  to see the details.
Epidemic Model
We developed a epidemic model with ordinary differential equation to predict the population dynamics of cockroaches infected by Metarhizium anisopliae. We then performed numerical simulations on the model and sensitivity analysis on some key parameters to find they impacts.
Statistic Model
We constructed a statistical model for our experimental data from simulating room. It can give us a clear and scientific understanding that whether there had significant difference in migration rate, mortality and gnawing rate between each products.
