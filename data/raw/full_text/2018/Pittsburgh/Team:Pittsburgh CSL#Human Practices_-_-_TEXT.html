Description
In order to engage the community, we presented our iGEM 2018 Living Battery project along with a DNA Code Game to a middle school innovative underwater robotics programâ€“ also known as The SeaPerch Program. The SeaPerch Program provides students with the opportunity to learn about robotics, engineering, science, and mathematics (STEM) while building an underwater ROV as part of a science and engineering technology curriculum.  Our purpose is to educate the youth about the risks of a damaged global environment due to the greenhouse gases in our community, in addition to enlightening them on a different discipline in STEM- in this case, synthetic biology.  In order to engage the students, we taught them our DNA Code Game found in the iOS App Store.  The students had a lot of fun playing the game and learning about DNA.
Game
Here is a screenshot from the App Store where you can download the game for free.
Here is a screenshot from the game.
This table uses the same principles as our cells to make proteins. Use the code table to decipher the code that is given. There's a message hidden within the code. To decipher the code to unlock the message, start from the middle of the code table work your way up to the end of the table. The letter at the outside of the table is the letter that you need for the code. Then you can work in reverse and write a code to tell your friends about the PGH-RESISTORS!
