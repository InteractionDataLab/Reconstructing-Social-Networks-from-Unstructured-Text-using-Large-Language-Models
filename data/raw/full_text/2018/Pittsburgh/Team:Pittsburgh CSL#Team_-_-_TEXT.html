Tyler Griffin
Hi my name is Tyler Griffin and I go to Westinghouse High school. I am in 10th Grade and my favorite school subjects are science and gym. Outside of school, I like to play the game Fortnite on my Playstation 4 with my friends and I also like to ride my bike when it's nice outside.
I'm a cook at the Pittsburgh Zoo and I have been working there for a year now. I also like to read books--lots and lots of books. When it's cold outside, I spend most of my time at the library.
Vianie Henri
My name is Vianie Henri! I am a Senior in the Bayer School of Natural and Environmental Sciences at Duquesne University. I am a Biology major with two minors in Biochemistry and Mathematics. When I am not studying for the next exam I enjoy conducting undergraduate research in neurobiology in the lab headed by Dr. Benedict Kolber. I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends and touring the city of Pittsburgh. I am interested in iGEM because it provided me the opportunity to work with and mentor high school students in the exciting field of Biology particularly microbiology.
