Test CAMERA Base Editing System
Goal: See that base editor (CAMERA W2.1) works with CAMERA R1. Confirm that mutation rate is linear and test the base editing efficiency. 96 deep well plate:
Steps: 1. To start the layout, fill every well expect C5-C8 with 800 μL of sterile water. Fill C5-C8 with 800 μL of fresh LB and appropriate amount of antibiotics (1000X Carb and Spec). Add inducers (200 ng/mL aTc and 0.1 mM IPTG) into C5 and C7. Add overnight cultures into C5-C8 and make sure they are 1:500 dilutions. Secure with 96 well plate film. Allow the plate to shake at 37℃ for 24 hours. 2. After 24 hours. take out the water in D5-D8 and refill these wells with 800 μL of fresh LB. Dilute the cultures in previous row (C5-C8) 500-fold into fresh LB media containing the corresponding inducers and antibiotics. Miniprep the rest of cultures in the previous row. Secure the plate with film and shake at 37℃ for another 24 hours. 3. Repeat Step 2 in the following two days. 4. Sanger sequencing results will then be analyzed by our software tool CrisPy.
Base Editing Improvement
Goals: Test if shortening the time between the dilutions would improve the editing rate. 96 deep well plate:
Steps: Follow CAMERA protocol. Dilute the cultures every 12 hours. Send for sequencing every 24 hours.
CrisPy
Goals: Test the ability of our software tool, CrisPy, for characterizing CRISPR on-target and off-target edits through Sanger sequencing. 96 deep well plate:
Steps: Follow CAMERA protocol, however change the antibiotics to CAM and Spec.
