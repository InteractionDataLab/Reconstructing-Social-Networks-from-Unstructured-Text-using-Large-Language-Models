  This table uses the same principles as our cells do to make proteins.
  Use the code table to decipher the code that is given.A message is hidden within the code. To decipher the code to unlock the message, start from the middle of the code table work your way up to the end of the table. The letter at the outside of the table is the letter that you need for the code.
  Then you can work in reverse and write a code to tell your friends about the PGH-RESISTORS

We are strategically located in Guadalajara, the second most populated city in Mexico and responsible of 7% of national gross domestic product. Our goal in the long term is to fulfil the Mexican demand of medium and high purity chitosan and to become the first Mexican exporter of high purity chitosan. We want to create dream jobs for young Mexican engineers and export our biotechnology worldwide.</P></VIDEO></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12 faceBot"><DIV class="col-md-2 col-md-offset-3"><SMALL style="color:white">Biophrame Technologies is a biotech company and manufacturer specialized in the production of Chitosan.</SMALL></DIV><DIV class="column full_size judges-will-not-evaluate"><H3>â˜…  ALERT! </H3><P>This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Judging/Medals">medal criterion</A> or <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Judging/Awards"> award listed below</A>. </P><P> Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal criterion and/or award.

Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such &quot;nuggets&quot; of computational work.
