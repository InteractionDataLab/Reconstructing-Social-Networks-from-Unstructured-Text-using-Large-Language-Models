By chance, I ended up working in a wetlab my freshman year. Like many of those with electrical engineering background, I was fascinated by the parallels between synthetic biological systems and circuit design. I wanted to continue to explore topics of biological modularity and control, as well as learn more about modelling non-linear systems. So when I found out about iGEM, I knew it was something worth pursuing!
