*BBa_K2221002 is a part our team submitted last year. For this year's project, we added more data to the registry for this part.
GlmY
GlmY functions as a small RNA.
It upregulates GlmZ which activates GlmS by stabilizing the transcription of the glmS gene.
GlmY is associated with alcohol resistance and the production of cell membrane.
