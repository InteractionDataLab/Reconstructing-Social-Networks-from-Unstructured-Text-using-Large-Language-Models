In the modern society, whole world is developing in an unbelievable speed. In order to support the development, we need a tremendous amount of energy. Although fuel energy can satisfy the current consumption, the emission of greenhouse gases is harming the environment. Thus, we need biofuel, an alternative to fossil fuels to combat with the climate change, secure the fossil energy supply, and sustain the consumption of the energy. Our iGEM teammates participated in the Science Fair Night, and we present our project to both students and parents. They showed a great interest in the project and gave us good feedback.
