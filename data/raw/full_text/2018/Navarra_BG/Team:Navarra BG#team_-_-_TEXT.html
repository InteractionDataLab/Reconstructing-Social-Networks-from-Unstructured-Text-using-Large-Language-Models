Our Team
We are team Navarra BG! The team comes from Navarra's Government educative programme  called Planet STEM, managed by Pamplona's Planetarium and fostered by NICDO, the Navarrese Governmental organisation for innovation and the promotion of Industry, Culture, Sport and Leisure, whose objective is to encourage youngsters to choose and study scientific and technological degrees. We´ve been also supported by researchers and scientists of CSIC.
