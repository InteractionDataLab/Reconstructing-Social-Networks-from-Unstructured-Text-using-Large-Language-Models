The actions we took are making our project go well. In order to achieve the goal, we should try for more opportunities as we can.
Followings are actions and events we took:
Education
We prepared a lesson about synthetic biology and taught senior high school students. By the feedback from these students, weâ€™re sure that they began to understand synthetic biology. In addition, we also promote our competition to these high school students. We hope that they can be more aware of synthetic biology through the lesson.
Fund
We held a fundraising explanation session on July 6th and invited companies relate to our project to attend. By this explanation session, we had more sources of funds and technical consulting. We will use these resources to make our project and model be more complete.
