Through Flory- Stockmayer theory, we can calculate the gelation and condensation when polymerization. Then, we can adjust our polymerization reaction to  meet the properties what we want.
			 </P><P class="second">Flory-Stockmayer assumptions</P><P class="description">1.	All functional groups on a branch unit are equally reactive
2.	All reactions occur between two molecules
3.	There are no intramolecular reactions</P><P class="second">Flory-Stockmayer theory of gel point</P><P class="description">The Flory-Stockmayer theory is an ideal prediction for polymers. This theory is mainly to integrate gelation and contraction reactions. Through this theory, we can understand the reaction of polymerization and adjust the conditions of polymerization.
			 </P><P class="description">Our monomer is Coniferyl alcohol. According to the reaction of the enzyme, our monomer will exhibit three resonance states. We want to make the material more biodegradable and chain-like, so we use oligomer to polymerization. Because coniferyl alcohol has three resonance states, our functional group is three (f=3).
			 </P><P class="second">Polymerization of LIGGREEN</P><P class="description">In the Flory-Stockmayer theory, our reaction belongs to ABg polymerization. LIGGREEN is ABg type of polycondensation, and there is an unreacted A and i(g -1)+1 B group <I>in vivo</I> with degree of polymerization i, and the species can be derived under the assumption of the inner cyclization reaction and the isocratic assumption.
We assume that our reaction only occur in oligomer and monomer. Because we would like to make the material formed in chain structure, we prefer to make oligomerization occur. Through ABg reaction, we are able to achieve oligomerization by adjusting the different conditions.
			 </P><P class="description">According to the above, our modeling is mainly based on three resonance states and ABg.
			 </P><P class="description">The initial conditions for the above equation are:
			 </P><P class="description">Because there is only one monomer group on each species.
			 </P><P class="description">For the following two types of equations. We can get,
			 </P><P class="description">After getting the above formula, we bring in our parameters.
			 </P><P class="description">With this distribution function, the various molecular parameters of LIGGEEN may be quantitatively known. Figure 1 shows the relationship between the polydispersity index of LIGGEEN under several g parameters and the conversion of the monomer group. g = 1 is the type AB monomer. Linear polycondensation, after the end of the reaction (x = 1), the polydispersity index of the LIGGEEN is only 2. If g &gt; 1, the formation of hyperbranched polymer, the polydispersity index of LIGGEEN becomes very large near the completion of the reaction. After this modeling, we can get conclusion that oligomerization would occur.

We try to establish a simple degradation rate model under ideal conditions, predicting the state of degradation and the treatment reference for the product.
			 
			 In this part, we will use the kinetics of enzymes to build model and first start form Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
From Michaelis-Menten kinetics
Assumed:
(1)	Lignin degradation is a one-step reaction
(2)	Both enzymes and LIGGREEN are first-order reactions
(3)	Value of enzyme activity is a constant.
(4)	Reaction solution is 1 unit volume.

Some simulation constants. 
1.	Initial number of bacteria
2.	Bacterial reproductive cycle
3.	Enzyme production cycle

In this part, we will use the kinetics of enzymes to build model and first start form Michaelis-Menten kinetics. This model is common and well-known models of enzyme kinetics, and it is takes the form of an equation to describe the rate of enzymatic reactions by reaction rate V and concentration of substrate S.

			 </P><P class="description">From the results, we found that the more initial bacteria, the faster the degradation, and the increase in the number of benefits will be lower and lower.

			 </P><P class="description">From the results, we found that the shorter average reproductive cycle, the faster the degradation. That is, if the material structure is easier reaction by enzyme of bacteria (microorganisms), the time required can be greatly reduced, but if the structure is complicated and difficult to use, it may cause difficulty in degradation, even in the same situation as plastic.
			 In summary, the simple part of the model is used to explore the degradation situation under ideal conditions. In the future, the data will be continuously collected to improve the model, hoping to make the model more realistic.
