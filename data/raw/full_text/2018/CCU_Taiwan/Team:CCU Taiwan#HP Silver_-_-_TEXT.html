The actions we took are making our project go well. In order to achieve our goal, we should try for more opportunities as we can.
Followings are actions and events we took:
Fund rising
We held a fundraising explanation session on July 6th and invited companies related to our project to attend. By this explanation session, we had more sources of funds and technical consulting. We will use these resources to make our project and model be more complete.
Public
A good application springs from social demand. To understand demand, we conducted a questionnaire. Through direct interaction with people at Chiayi Station, we understood the needs of the general public and understand what problems the current society faces.
Education
To promote synthetic biology, inspire students and help them understand what iGEM is, we held a synthetic biology lesson during summer vacation. In addition, we shared some knowledge of synthetic biology and our project on our Facebook page.
Collaboration
Besides good teamwork, if we did not have a many powerful helping hands to supply or collaborate with us, we would not achieve our goals.
Safety
Genetically modified organisms escaping the lab are a serious problem that will bring unpredictable impacts to our ecosystem. In our part design and production line, we paid careful attention to biosafety.
Engaging Experts
To make our project better, we connected with experts and doctors in different fields improving the LIGGREEN. Without their helps, we cannot achieve our goal.
