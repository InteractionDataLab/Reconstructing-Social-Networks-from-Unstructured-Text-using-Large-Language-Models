PARTS OVERVIEW
Background
“LIGGREEN” is composed of monolignols. We have produced three enzymes to catalyze the polymerization. Laccase 1 from Pinus taeda can catalyze the dehydrogenation of monolignols , which leads to free radical addition of dehydrogenated monolignols. However, after the monolignols become dimers or oligomers, it will be hard for them to bind onto the active site of laccase 1 and stop the dehydrogenation reaction of monolignols. In this case, we choose the others enzymes-peroxidase 16 and peroxidase 18. Those are isoenzymes from Picea abies, have the ability to bind onto oligomers and directly catalyze polymerization.
All the enzymes above can function in the same pH value and buffer, which  is critical to our design for co-reaction in production line.
