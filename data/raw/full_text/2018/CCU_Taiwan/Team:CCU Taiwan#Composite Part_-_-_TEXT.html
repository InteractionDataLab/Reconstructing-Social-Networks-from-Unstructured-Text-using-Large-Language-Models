COMPOSITE PART
BBa_K2809011
laccase 1
We use pGAPZ A vector from invitrogen and insert this part to construct our vector. We constructed this part by combining BBa_K2809001, BBa_K2809002 and BBa_K2809010.
This part contain a Kozak sequence for initiating and enhancing translation, Prepro-alpha-factor as a signal peptide for secretion, codon-optimized version of laccase gene sequence, HA tag for Western Blot protein detection and 6xHis-tag for protein purification.
Figure 1: The schematic structure of gene design- Lac1.
It will produce the mature laccase 1 without Prepro-alpha-factor, and the molecular weight of enzyme will be 63.65 kilodaltons.
Figure 2: The result of western blot— laccase 1.
BBa_K2809021
peroxidase 18
We use pGAPZ A vector from invitrogen and insert this part to construct our vector. We constructed this part by combining BBa_K2809001, BBa_K2809002 and BBa_K2809020.
This part contain a Kozak sequence for initiating and enhancing translation, Prepro-alpha-factor as a signal peptide for secretion, codon-optimized version of peroxidase 18 gene sequence, V5-tag for Western Blot protein detection and 6xHis-tag for protein purification.
Figure 3: The schematic structure of gene design- Px18.
It will produce the mature peroxidase 16 without Prepro-alpha-factor, and the molecular weight of enzyme should be 35.29 kilodaltons. However, because of protein N-linked glycosylation, the molecular weight of enzyme will be about 37~45 kilodaltons according to the Western blot result.

BBa_K2809031
peroxidase 16
We use pGAPZ A vector from invitrogen and insert this part to construct our vector. We constructed this part by combining BBa_K2809001, BBa_K2809002 and BBa_K2809030.
This part contain a Kozak sequence for initiating and enhancing translation, Prepro-alpha-factor as a signal peptide for secretion, codon-optimized version of peroxidase 16 gene sequence, FLAG-tag for Western Blot protein detection and 6xHis-tag for protein purification.
Figure 5: The schematic structure of gene design- Px16.
We use pGAPZ A vector from invitrogen and insert this part to construct our vector. We constructed this part by combining BBa_K2809001, BBa_K2809002 and BBa_K2809030.
This part contain a Kozak sequence for initiating and enhancing translation, Prepro-alpha-factor as a signal peptide for secretion, codon-optimized version of peroxidase 16 gene sequence, FLAG-tag for Western Blot protein detection and 6xHis-tag for protein purification.
