</P><P class="description">Prof. Yuan-Shing Perng helped us test whether the paper laminated with LIGGREEN can be separated into paper pulping and LIGGREEN. In the interview with professor Perng, he confirmed that a small amount of lignin mixed into the ordinary pulp will not affect the paper remaking process, maybe LIGGREEN can be separated, too. He taught us to operate the pulper, after 200 seconds of pulping and beating, LIGGREEN and the paper were indeed separated. This proved that LIGGREEN would not harm in the pulp recycling system.

</P><P class="description">Prof. Wen-Jau Lee told us that in the reaction forming LIGGREEN from monolignols bonding to oligomers, there are some bonding nodes would act. He suggested that the oligomers we produced were preferably two-dimensional chain systems, not three-dimensional, to have thermoplastic properties.

</P><P class="description">More Wu recommended that our products may need to consider the shelf life, because some paper containers such as milk carton are packaging beverage for a long time and the lining of them cannot be leach. And he mentioned that the government used the method of Administrative guidance and Subsidy incentive to try to improve the recovery yield. 
However, some misunderstandings in the process led to false positives in the news, causing the public to throw paper containers into general garbage disposal.

</P><P class="description">Prof. Ping-Mu Shu told us the truth of recycling in Taiwan, he also told us our product would not influence the paper recycled system because the amount of our LIGGREEN is very low and we do not need to set a recycled spot of LIGGREEN cups.
</P><P class="first" id="ca6">Manufacturers &amp; Factories</P><P class="second">Lian-Tai</P><P class="description">Liantai is the only manufacturer with the support from government and controlling the technology to recycle the paper containers and separated paper from the polyethylene lynin.
The recycling volume of paper containers last year are 25,000 tons, which meant that only 15% of the paper containers had been recycled.

Q: Professor Peng had said that the general paper industries could also separate paper from plastic. We wonder to know that why only your manufacture uses the separated technology but not afraid of others replace you?
A: The general manufacturer does not want to do it at all, it will only increase the cost. The main reason is that the process of separating paper form plastics is complicated, all the entry would be supervised by government, and the obstacle is great. The only advantage is that you can get the money from the government (or from the paper manufacturer).
Views on disposable paper cups form Lian-Tai: I think the current propaganda is not to use disposable products, but there will be one-time products, but also because of his health problems, and now he has come back again, contradicting the original intention.
Like a fast food restaurant, if it is not used after repeated use, it will cause health problems. In addition, if every fast-food restaurant has to add a sink or a regional cleaning thing, it will also increase the cost. If you give it to a big factory to wash it, it will definitely save more money than you need to clean it.
In fact, in terms of the types of recycling, while increasing the recycling category of paper containers, there have been many difficulties and the number of procedures has increased. Although the government's decision support has indeed increased the amount of recycling, it has not been reviewed from the entire process of recycling, but it has increased the complexity.
