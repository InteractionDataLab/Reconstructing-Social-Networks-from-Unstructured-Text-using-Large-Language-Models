               My priority throughout iGEM was ensuring the successful progression of our project. I personally worked on researching literature relevant to our designs, brainstorming the impacts of our system, interviews with professionals for human practice, discussions with financial supporters, organizing collaborations with other iGEM teams, facilitating team workshops, editing our wiki, and creating our presentation &amp; poster.

                I serve as the fundraising lead and I am responsible for raising money for the team. This includes money for team stipend funds, lab equipment, iGEM competition expenses, and much more. I am also responsible for contacting, meeting, and following up with potential sponsors and investors. As well as networking and establishing fundraising opportunities and connections for our future iGEM teams. An important skills to have, as an entrepreneur, is the ability to raise money and tell a story and as fundraising lead I am able to do just that.

              I led the Human Practices team focusing on how our project could affect the field of molecular biology and the brewing industry. I researched DNA watermarking and with the help of Florida Department of Law Enforcement, our Design, and Create Teams, a watermark was able to be integrated into our plasmid. I set up interview appointments with contacts in the field, interviewed the brewmaster, and took pictures at Proof Brewing Company. During the project I also wrote the HP report, detailing HP’s investigation of the team’s project.

                I worked on the Human Practice team in contacting individuals who could provide knowledge on the application of our topic. I also worked on the modeling team with the goal of creating a mathematical model to calculate the energy from the speaker to the median and researching the parameters of how sound travels.

             I developed the background and plan needed for understanding our project. Then, conducted research to understand E. Coli pathways that may trigger under sound stress. I also contributed to the experimentation of the ordered parts and supported the create team throughout the project. Much of the &quot;Design Page&quot; content was edited and formatted by me.

                I researched characterized genetic systems that could potentially respond to sound, including mechanosensitive channels and ion signaling pathways. I thoroughly analyzed these findings to help select our systems to be tested. I also produced much of the content under the &quot;Design Page&quot; of the wiki.

               As lab leader and iGEM team member my duties spanned different tasks. At the beginning of iGEM 2018, I collected and read research papers that could help us learn as much as we could about audiogenetics. Once we learned enough about the project I helped assemble plasmids, transform cells, and make plates &amp; master cultures. I was in charge of the experimental setup which included exposing the cells to sound, making measurements and deciding what method to use to expose the cells to sound. The experimental setup included filling 96 well plates with appropriate dilutions and making Fluorescence and optical density measurements before and after sound exposure. Additionally, I purified plasmids in order to sequence them and confirm that we had the DNA we intended to assemble. Also I delegated different tasks to my teammates as we went along with the project. Lastly, I analyzed the data obtained from the experiments.
