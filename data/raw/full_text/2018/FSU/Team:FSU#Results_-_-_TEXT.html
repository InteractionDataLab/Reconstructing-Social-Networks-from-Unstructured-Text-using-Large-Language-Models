Results
The Berkeley promoters (BBa_K112400, BBa_K112401, BBa_K112402, BBa_K112405 and BBa_K112407) and the FSU promoters (PbamE, PpspA, and PosmC) were used in test devices described in the design section.  The devices were inserted into the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone.  The resulting plasmid vector was used to transform E. coli NEB 5-alpha chassis. The engineered cells were grown at 37 degrees celsius exposed to ambient, 8 kHz/80 dB, 8 kHz/100 dB, and 2 kHz/100 dB sound.  Red fluorescence was measured using a fluorospectrophotometer with excitation of 575 nm and emission of 610 nm.
The first phase of the experiment consisted of growing the cells in an incubator at 37 degrees for 8 hours exposed to ambient sound.  We measured fluorescence from the cells that contained the Berkeley and FSU promoters.  3 out of the 5 Berkeley promoters (BBa_K112400, BBa_K112401, AND BBa_K112402) and 1 out of the 3 FSU promoters (PpspA) demonstrated basal gene expression when incubated with exposure to ambient sound.  The results are summarized in Figure 1 and 2.
The cells that contained BBa_ K112400 and PbamE appeared to increase fluorescence when exposed to 8 kHz/80 dB sound.  Fluorescence decreased in all the other cells.  Cells exposed to 8 kHz/100 dB sound decreased fluorescence in all cells except those carrying the PosmC and BBa_K112407 promoters.  Exposing the cells to 2 kHz/100 dB sound correlated with increased levels of fluorescence in all cells except cells that contain BBa_K112407.
We understood that our project was high risk.  We decided to build and test cells that contained three promoters from the BIOFAB collection (apFAB46, apFAB82 and apFAB90).   by measuring their RFP expression level using A fluorospectrophotometer with excitation-emission of 575 and 610 nm was used to measure red fluorescence. The promoter apFAB46 showed the lowest strength, at 15,819 Mean RFU/OD700, ApFAB90 was found to have medium strength at 28,510 RFU/OD700 and apFAB82 showed the highest strength at 47,118 RFU/OD700.

Discussion
The results indicate that BBa_K112400, BBa_K112401, BBa_K112402, and BBa_K2832003 (PpspA) promote a baseline of gene expression that is above the negative control.  The results suggests that BBa_K112400, BBa_K112401, BBa_K2832003 (PpspA) increase expression when exposed to 2 kHz/100 dB sound.  The cells containing BBa_K112400, BBa_K112401, BBa_K112402, BBa_K112405, and BBa_K2832003 (PpspA) demonstrated a decrease in fluorescence after exposure to 8 kHz sound.  We do not know why.  Exposing the cells to 8 kHz sound for 8 hours may be harmful or inhibit gene expression.
The BIOFAB promoters showed an unexpected level of activity. The promoter apFAB46 showed the lowest activity but was expected to be the highest. ApFAB90 was found to have medium expression, however, was expected to be low activity. Finally, apFAB82 showed the highest fluorescence, however, was expected to be the medium expression. Since unexpected levels of promoter activities were seen, this may be an indication that the performance of BIOFAB parts may be influenced by specific growth conditions and not only on ribosome binding sites like previously thought (See Figure 5).
