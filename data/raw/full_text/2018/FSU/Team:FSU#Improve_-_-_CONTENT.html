Berkeley iGEM team uploaded several sequences expected to contain promotors activated when an Escherichia Coli cell was exposed to sound. As an improvement of previous iGEM parts, the FSU 2018 iGEM team further investigated Berkeley’s parts to test these sequences, which are found naturally in E. coli, hold a promotor that responds to sound stress. After we constructed five devices which include a Berkeley putative promotor and the sequence that codes for red fluorescent protein and assembled the parts into plasmids. The cells containing Berkeley promoter BBa_K112402 were expressing red before sound exposure. Experimentally, this promoter, which Berkeley  believed that somewhere in this sequence was a promotor for the fabA gene, stimulates constitutive expression. Our characterized test device with this promotor has been uploaded to the Part’s Registry as BBa_K2832011. Our measurements are being analyzed to see if expression is upregulated when exposed to sound. These measurements will be presented at the Jamboree.</P>
