Collaborations
University of Florida
Our primary collaboration was with the University of Florida iGEM team. UF first contacted our team to invite us to a Florida iGEM social they hosted in July. The event was held at the molecular biology building of UF where we presented our projects to each other and further discussed plans for a meaningful collaboration. The event ended with a social gathering of both teams at Lake Wauburg, consisting of team building activities and a picnic lunch. Our team then invited UF's team to a workshop we hosted in September. The workshop was held at the FSU College of Medicine, where we collectively built the design specifications for their system and provided constructive feedback on various facets of our projects. We also mentored UF through the development of their wiki.

Cornell University
Cornell's iGEM team initially contacted us to discuss whether our project of activating bacteria with sound could provide insight to their frequency based biological band-pass filter. The discussions continued throughout the summer as our projects developed, consisting of research literature and experimental methods analysis as well as feedback on our overall projects. Cornell eventually sent us an educational plasmid kit they were using to introduce young students to the field of synthetic biology. We provided feedback on our experience using the educational kit for Cornell to further develop their educational kit.

University of Lethbridge
The University of Lethbridge's iGEM team helped mentor us through the development of our wiki and we provided constructive feedback on each other's projects.
