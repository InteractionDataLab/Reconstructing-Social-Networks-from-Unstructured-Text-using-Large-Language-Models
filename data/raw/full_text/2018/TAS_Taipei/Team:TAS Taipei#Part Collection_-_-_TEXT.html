PART COLLECTION
The range of our part numbers is BBa_K2539100 to BBa_K2539550. Our parts collection introduces the basic sequences of ALDH2*1 (BBa_K2539150), the enzyme responsible for acetaldehyde metabolism in humans, and its mutant form ALDH2*2 (BBa_K2539250), without internal Pstl cutting sites. We made constructs to constitutively express ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2 (BBa_K2539100, BBa_K2539200). Our parts also allow for the purification of ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2 (BBa_K2539101, BBa_K2539201) to better test enzyme activity and to deliver in our produced candy. To regulate the expression of ALDH2*1 by probiotics in our mouth, we built a construct that only produces ALDH2*1 in the presence of ethanol (BBa_K2539450). A similar construct producing GFP was also made to test the strength of this ethanol-controlled promoter (BBa_K2539550). Together, these parts allowed us to characterize both crude and purified forms of ALDH2, regulate its expression, and make a product to treat ALDH2 deficiency.
The design and characterization of each part are documented on the Parts Registry (linked below).
