EDUCATION & PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
SUMMARY
Through public engagement and education, we sought to foster dialogue regarding synthetic biology both within and outside of our school. In our bioethics roundtable discussion, we invited students and faculty to discuss the bioethics of our project and synthetic biology in general. Our survey and infographics further enhanced such discourse as we went around Taipei to communicate our project with the public and receive insightful opinions on the method of delivery for our genetically engineered product. Through our talks in health classes and class meetings at our high school, we encouraged students to be more conscientious of the health risks associated with ALDH2 deficiency, while our 7th grade and kindergarten lessons introduced younger students to synthetic biology and making scientific observations, respectively. Finally, our examination of current alcohol labeling regulations and policy brief sought to enhance communication with the Taiwanese government regarding a need for better health warning labeling practices.
BIOETHICS ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION
In February, we hosted a Bioethics Roundtable, where we invited students and teachers to discuss the social, ethical, and medical aspects of our project. Hoping to generate discussion and new perspectives, we developed a set of questions, assigned different roles to participants, and asked for opinions from the respective views of each assigned role.
An example:
“Should ALDH2 testing be a free test service for people? In what form would you want ALDH2 testing to be available? Kit? Hospital testings? Who should pay for the test?”
The designated roles for this question included Government Official, College Student, Hospital Administrator, Employer, and Alcohol Manufacturer.
There was no apparent preference for home-kits versus hospital tests, but a strong preference for tests to be covered by the government through the National Health Insurance. Some hospital administrators even suggested that the government should raise taxes on alcohol in order to fund these tests. On the other hand, government officials argued that the government should not be held responsible for providing testing services because drinking is a personal choice.
We also asked participants their opinions on ALDH2 deficiency and suggestions for ways to distribute our product in the future. (Whole team activity)
SURVEY & INFOGRAPHICS
To interact with our community on a more personal level, we went around Taipei city to pass out fliers about ALDH2 deficiency, ask people to fill out our survey, and perform free bandage tests to determine if people are ALDH2 deficient. We followed the procedures from a “DIY ALDH2 Deficiency Testing Kit” given by TAIES, which consists of placing a bandage soaked with 75% ethanol on one’s forearm for 7-10 minutes. If the bandaged skin turns red, the person is tested positive for the deficiency.
We went around Taipei to pass out our fliers about ALDH2 deficiency, perform free bandage tests, and ask people to fill out our survey (we even went to the Apple store and put our survey up on their display phones!).

EDUCATION
High School: Health Classes & Class Meetings
In our school, all ninth grade students are required to take a health class which already discusses the negative effects of alcohol consumption. We felt it was also important for students to be aware of the increased cancer risks and the large ALDH2 deficient population in Taiwan, so we spoke about this in several health classes and class meetings.

7th Grade: Introduction to Synthetic Biology
Through interactive activities, our team introduced the basics of synthetic biology and common lab techniques to over 200 seventh graders. Using dyes, students learned how to use micropipettes and run gel electrophoresis. Using simulated DNA parts (promoters, open reading frames, etc.), students also learned to design plausible DNA constructs to solve theoretical scenarios. (Whole team activity)
Kindergarten: Principles of Observation
We introduced kindergarteners to science with four simple activities. In one activity, we taught them how to use a microscope to observe the intricate details on a 100 NTD bill. In another, we used balloons to introduce them to “invisible forces” such as static electricity and electrical charges. (Whole team activity)
POLICY REGULATIONS
National Health Insurance
Taiwan has the largest ALDH2*1 deficient population in the world.  Despite this, nothing is being done at the governmental level to combat this issue. We tried to find out more about this lack of action. From our calls to local hospitals, we learned that ALDH2 deficiency tests are not readily available, yet, a variety of smoking-related tests are commonly provided for free by Taiwan’s Ministry of Health and Welfare under “Smoking Cessation” programs. We were also surprised to find that citizens (30 and above) who chew betel nut or smoke have access to free oral cancer screenings every 2 years.
We reached out to Dr. Cheng-hua Lee, the Deputy Director General of the National Health Insurance Administration (NHI) to ask some questions relating to ALDH2 health issues. We first asked why Taiwan’s health insurance covers smoking-related issues but not alcohol related issues. Dr. Lee believes there is not a clear relationship between alcohol and increased cancer risks. He says that unlike smoking and betel nut chewing, which have direct cause-and-effect relationships with certain cancers, the combination of drinking and ALDH2 deficiency have yet to demonstrate a direct relationship with cancers (head and neck/oral). Dr. Lee also said that current statistics show that drunk driving is the largest alcohol-induced problem, and not the deficiency. He went on to say that the deficiency might even be a form of protection as people are likely to drink less because of their flushed symptoms.
We asked about the possibility of ALDH2 tests being covered by health insurance, but Dr. Lee believes that since the flushing symptoms are so apparent, there is no need to advocate for the test. He says that since the deficiency is not a “sickness,”, confirmatory diagnostics are not required.
When presented with results from our survey, Dr. Lee does realize that current health education programs are in need for reforms, and that maybe “greater implications” exist regarding alcohol ingestion. We also wanted to see if our product has the potential to be covered by insurance, unfortunately, he said only prescription drugs can be covered.
Alcohol Warning Labels & Policy Brief
Concerned about the large ALDH2 deficient population in Taiwan, we tried to look for policies aimed to educate the public about alcohol consumption and their ramifications on health. We found that little attention has been paid to this matter in terms of policy and regulation. For example, unlike cigarette health warning labels, alcohol products lack similar rigid health-oriented labels, despite having similar detrimental impacts on health. We also surveyed several alcohol manufacturers on their labeling practices and looked at alcohol warning labels at supermarkets and convenience stores. Only about half of the labels directly linked excessive drinking to negative health effects.
We looked at alcohol warning labels (boxed in yellow) in a convenience store, and found that less than half of the products (in this picture, only 2 out of 9 labels) mentioned health risks associated with alcohol consumption. Furthermore, these labels blend in with the product labels and are very small in size--current regulations only require warning text to be larger than 2.65mm in size.
Using tobacco regulations as a model, we composed a policy brief with suggestions for modifying current alcohol labeling practices. We seek to inform more people about the health effects of excessive alcohol consumption. (Policy Brief by Iris H.)

Our policy brief was sent to two Taiwanese government agencies: the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

MEDIA OUTLETS
To raise awareness of ALDH2 deficiency to the general public, we reached out to media outlets. In our immediate community, we published an article with Blue and Gold, our school newspaper. To extend our impact outside our school community, we reached out to Today News, the Global Views Commonwealth Publishing Group, and The News Lens. After corresponding with them, these news outlets published articles about ALDH2 deficiency and our team. Through International Community Radio Taiwan (ICRT), we were also able to speak about the common misconceptions surrounding ALDH2 deficiency over the radio!
