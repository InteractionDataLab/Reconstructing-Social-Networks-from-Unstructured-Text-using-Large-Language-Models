Several of our members have attended weekly meetings with the team and discussed our projects together. They have been very generous in lending us chemicals and reagents (PEG 8000 and MR17 broth). This year three members from TAS (Anna, Yasmin and Jake) are members on both NYMU and TAS teams. They learned the cloning cycle from TAS and helped run experiments and human practices for NYMU throughout the year. Additionally, they have provided access and instruction for several instruments. Specifically they provided protocols, cuvettes, and access to an electroporation machine so that we could attempt electroporation into <I>Lactobacillus casei</I> and <I>Lactococcus lactis</I>. They also provided access and instruction to a 96-well plate reader so that we could test the efficiency our alcohol induced promoter (K2539550). In return we have helped NYMU with the cloning of biobrick parts. Lastly, TAS and NYMU teams worked together to help troubleshoot the interlab study and measurements using their plate reader.</H6></DIV><DIV class="row"><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 description paddingremovaly">Near the DNA submission deadline, we assisted NYMU by cloning their ALB-mCherry (BBa_K2751012) and mEGFP (BBa_K2751011) parts into the standard BioBrick backbone pSB1C3.  We did this for them while they were also trying to clone the same part, just in case their ligation and transformation was unsuccessful.  Both teams were successful and this helped them verify that ligation and transformation of their part was successful.</H6></DIV><DIV class="row col-lg-offset-3 image_container col-lg-3 imagebox"><H5 class="subtitle"><B>PCR check results for AMC and MEGFP constructs using VF2 and VR primers.</B> The expected size of both PCR products are 1 kb (yellow box).

This year we were excited to test their prototype of an ElectroPen. They shipped their pen to us along with videos and a protocol. After going over specific details of the protocol through Skype, we then used their ElectroPen to electroporate a GFP expression construct into both <I>E. coli</I> K-12 DH5a and <I>E. coli</I> Nissle 1917. We validated that the ElectroPen works! It successfully helped transform both <I>E. coli</I> strains!</H6></DIV><DIV class="row col-lg-offset-3 image_container col-lg-3 imagebox"><H5 class="subtitle">Using Lambert_GAâ€™s ElectroPen and protocol, we successfully transformed GFP into <I>E. coli</I> Nissle 1917 and <I>E. coli</I> K-12 DH5a, verifying that their ElectroPen works!</H5></DIV><DIV class="row"><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 bigthannormal paddingremovaly"><B>6th Annual Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference</B></H6></DIV><DIV class="row"><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 description paddingremovaly">We attended the 6th Annual Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference at the end of July/beginning of August at NCHU (National Chung Hsing University). At the Asia-Pacific iGEM conference, we met over 20 teams from China, Taiwan, and Japan, presented projects, and discussed project issues with other teams during poster sessions and social events. There, we received helpful feedback about our project, and more importantly, we were able to get into contact with an expert in the field of probiotics, Dr. Ying Chieh Tsai.</H6></DIV><DIV class="row"><H1 class="col-lg-12 col-lg-offset-3 paddingremovaly" id="aboutourschool">INTERACTIONS WITH MORE IGEM TEAMS!</H1></DIV><DIV class="row"><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 bigthannormal paddingremovaly"><B>TecCem</B></H6></DIV><DIV class="row"><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 description paddingremovaly">Majo U.
