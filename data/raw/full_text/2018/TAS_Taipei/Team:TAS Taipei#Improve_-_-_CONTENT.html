BBa_K2539550 improves the PalcA promoter by adding a constitutively expressed alcR in the same construct, and using a visible reporter GFP. We used this construct to characterize the function of the original part, PalcA promoter alone. Our experiments and results are documented below.

AlcR and PalcA-Regulated GFP Expression Construct </B></H6></DIV><DIV class="row"><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 description paddingremovaly">This construct combines two of our submitted composite parts: a constitutively expressed alcR construct (BBa_K2539300) and a PalcA-regulated GFP expression construct (BBa_K2539500).  
PalcA is an inducible promoter (BBa_K2092002), which can be activated in the presence of both ethanol and a transcription factor, alcR (BBa_K2092001). It was originally isolated from the fungus <I>Aspergillus nidulans</I> (Panozzo <I>et al.</I>, 1997). AlcR is a gene found in <I>Aspergillus nidulans</I> which encodes for a regulatory protein (Panozzo <I>et al.</I>, 1997). AlcR can bind to the alcA and aldA promoters (PalcA and PaldA, respectively). In the presence both AlcR and ethanol or threonine, genes downstream of these promoters are expressed (Felenbok <I>et al.,</I> 1988).  
GFP is used as a visible reporter so we can characterize the function of the promoter PalcA.

We use a strong promoter and strong RBS combination (BBa_K880005) to maximize protein production, the alcR sequence (BBa_K2092001), and a double terminator (BBa_B0015) to end transcription. Behind this, the PalcA promoter (BBa_K2092002) is placed in front of a strong RBS (BBa_B0034), GFP (BBa_E0040), and a double terminator (BBa_B0015).  
Together, this construct expresses alcR, which can activate the PalcA promoter and express GFP if ethanol is present.

Bacterial cultures with different plasmids were grown overnight. In addition to Pconst_alcR+PalcA_GFP (BBa_K2539550), cultures of Pconst_alcR (BBa_K2539300), PalcA_GFP (BBa_K2539500), and a positive control expressing GFP were also prepared. An initial fluorescence reading was taken using a 96 well plate reader.   

When alcR is constitutively expressed and ethanol is present, we hypothesized that if PalcA were functional, then we should see the Pconst_alcR+PalcA_GFP (BBa_K2539550) cultures glow green. To characterize the promoter, we added varying amounts of ethanol into cultures of Pconst_alcR+PalcA_GFP, sealed the tubes to prevent evaporation, and left them in a shaking incubator for 24 hours. Fluorescence absorbance measurements were taken before the addition of ethanol and after 24 hours with ethanol.

Pconst refers to the constitutive promoter we used (BBa_K880005). Lysogeny broth (LB), Pconst_alcR, and PalcA_GFP were used as negative controls for this experiment. 
</H5></DIV><DIV class="row"><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 description paddingremovaly">Our results matched the general expected trend. Addition of 0.3 g of ethanol to Pconst_alcR+PalcA_GFP (BBa_K2539550) seemed to yield the highest fluorescence, and lower amounts of  0.01 g and 0.1 g ethanol were not significantly different than the controls (LB only, Pconst_alcR, and PalcA_GFP). Over 0.5 g of ethanol seemed to kill the bacteria (3 mL of culture), which matches literature thresholds of ethanol tolerance (Chong <I>et al</I>, 2013). In our tests, 0.3 g of ethanol yielded the greatest amount of GFP; however, this effect was extremely weak and the measured fluorescence was about 500 times lower than the positive control (constitutively expressed GFP; not shown here). In summary, <B>the ethanol promoter, PalcA, is functional in the presence of alcR and a specific concentration of ethanol, but is <I>very</I> inefficient.</B></H6><DIV class="row"><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 bigthannormal paddingremovaly"><B>References</B></H6></DIV><DIV class="row"><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 description paddingremovaly">
