TEAM TRAINING & PROJECT START
Does your institution teach an iGEM or synthetic biology course? Taipei American School teaches a year long synthetic biology course. During the first semester, students learn synthetic biology techniques in both classroom and laboratory settings. During the second semester and over the summer, students work on their iGEM project.
When did you start this course? TAS started this course in 2013. The 2018 TAS_Taipei team began taking this class in August 2017.
Are the syllabus and course materials freely available online? We follow the BioBuilder curriculum (biobuilder.org).
When did you start your brainstorming? November 2017
When did you start in the lab? August 2017
When did you start working on your project? November 2017
