        We envision delivering our treatment either as purified ALDH2*1 enzymes or ALDH2*1-expressing probiotics. We tested both of these delivery forms under realistic oral conditions by accounting for two factors: the viscosity of saliva and temperature. Our test results show that both purified enzymes and genetically engineered living probiotics (we used the probiotic <I>E. coli</I> Nissle 1917) are able to metabolize acetaldehyde significantly faster than their mutant ALDH2*2 counterparts under simulated conditions in artificial saliva at body temperature.

       To test our products under realistic conditions of the human oral cavity, we considered two factors: temperature and viscosity of saliva. We used the incubator to simulate mouth temperatures, which are around 37°C, and we used artificial saliva to mimic conditions in the mouth. However, we visited multiple pharmacies and learned that vendors no longer distribute artificial saliva in Taiwan. We asked Dr. Hsiu-Ying Huang, who told us that there are other dental products which have the same ingredients as artificial saliva, such as cellulose, glycerin, and xylitol (Amal <I>et al.</I>, 2017). After looking through different available products, we decided to make our own artificial saliva using Biotene Dry Mouth OralBalance Gel, which is a concentrated gel used to treat xerostomia, more commonly known as dry mouth <A href="https://www.biotene.com/dry-mouth-products/moisturizing-gel/" class="_" target="_blank"> (visit Biotene for product details).</A>

To mimic saliva in the mouth, we needed to dilute the concentrated Biotene gel. We determined the amount of dilution by researching the viscosity of saliva: the mean viscosity of saliva at room temperature is 2.1 centipoise (cP), and the mean viscosity of water at room temperature is 0.95 cP (Kusy <I>et al.</I>, 1995; Tang, 2016). Thus, we needed to dilute the gel so that the resulting solution would be about 2 times as viscous as water. Conducting a ball drop test to find determine viscosity (Figure 3-1; we adapted the ball drop procedure and viscosity calculations from Tang, 2016. See Protocols in our lab notebook for details), we found that diluting 6.5 grams of Biotene gel into 50 mL of water would very closely mimic the viscosity of saliva (Tang, 2016). The viscosity of this saliva model is 2.09 cP. <B>All subsequent experiments were performed using this artificial saliva at 37°C.</B></H6></DIV><DIV class="row col-lg-offset-3 image_containerv1 col-lg-3 imagebox"><H5 class="subtitlev1"><B>Figure 3-1.

       Our survey results showed that 53% of the people preferred delivery of treatment using probiotics. Probiotics are bacteria that are beneficial to the health of the host (Haukioja, 2010). The ability for different probiotics to compete for cell adhesion in the oral cavity makes them an excellent fit for our ALDH2*1 delivery system (Haukioja, 2010; Haukioja <I>et al.</I>, 2006; Samot <I>et al.</I>, 2011; Stamatova <I>et al.</I>, 2009). Originally, our visit to the Yakult factory inspired us to use <I>Lactobacillus casei</I> (<I>L. casei</I>), a common probiotic strain, as our chassis. However, after multiple attempts, we were unable to transform our ALDH2*1 expression plasmid into <I>L. casei</I>. After consulting Dr. Ying Chieh Tsai, a renowned probiotic expert in Asia, we learned that transforming <I>L. casei</I> was uncommon in Taiwan and difficult to do. He recommended that we try two other probiotics strains, <I>Lactococcus lactis</I> (<I>L. lactis</I>) and <I>Escherichia coli</I> Nissle 1917 (<I>Ec</I>N).

       The candy-making process consists of three stages: dissolving, cooling, and molding (Husband, 2014). We want to add probiotics to the candy during the cooling stage to make sure they remain alive. To determine the exact temperature at which our engineered probiotics should be added, we tested bacterial growth at different temperatures. 

10 mL of our probiotic culture was pelleted and resuspended in 10 mL distilled water. The test was carried out by heating this probiotic mixture from 25°C to 80°C, and plating a set volume of bacteria at 5°C intervals (Figure 3-9). In addition to testing ALDH2-expressing <I>Ec</I>N, we also used GFP-expressing <I>Ec</I>N as a positive control to show that proteins are still functional. Only bacteria exposed to temperatures at 60°C and below grew and carried functional proteins (Figure 3-9).

      Following the same procedure, <B>we made some probiotic candies carrying ALDH2*1-expressing <I>Ec</I>N.</B> We wanted to test whether this probiotic candy would be effective under realistic conditions by answering two questions:</H6></DIV><DIV class="row"><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 description paddingremovaly doubleindent">
      1) How long does it take for the candy to dissolve in saliva?
2) Can the probiotic candy successfully metabolize acetaldehyde?
</H6></DIV><DIV class="row"><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 description paddingremovaly indent">
      To answer the first question, we measured the amount of time needed for the probiotic candy to dissolve in artificial saliva at 37°C. Ideally, we do not want the candy to dissolve too slowly, as that would mean that the ALDH2*1-carrying probiotics are not released into the mouth fast enough. On the other hand, we also do not want the candy to dissolve too quickly, because that might lead to most of the probiotics being swallowed right away. 

We wanted our candy to dissolve at roughly the same rate real cough drops do, so we compared our candy with two commercial products, Ricola and Nin Jiom herbal candies. The candies were placed in a beaker of artificial saliva on a heat plate set at 37°C, with a stir bar to mimic saliva movement (Figure 3-12). Our probiotic candy dissolved after 60 minutes, whereas it took 54 minutes and 63 minutes for Nin Jiom and Ricola, respectively (Figure 3-11). In the lab setup, Nin Jiom dissolved after 54 minutes, but when we <B>ate</B> the Nin Jiom candies (different package, outside of the lab), they dissolved after an average of 13 minutes (± 2 minutes standard error, n= 6 team members).

      To answer the second question, we isolated ALDH2*1-expressing <I>Ec</I>N from the dissolved probiotic candy and tested its ability to metabolize acetaldehyde. We ran a functional test (the procedure is described above and on our Experiments page) by measuring NADH concentrations (Figure 3-12). In this experiment we compared three different candies, containing either ALDH2*1-<I>Ec</I>N probiotics, ALDH2*2-<I>Ec</I>N probiotics, or no probiotics. The candies were first dissolved like they would be in the mouth, then the samples were centrifuged to isolate the probiotics. After decanting the supernatant, we lysed the cells and tested the cell lysates under simulated oral conditions (in artificial saliva at 37°C). <B>Our results show that <I>Ec</I>N expressing ALDH2*1 in the probiotic candy is functional and effective at metabolizing acetaldehyde</B> (Figure 3-12).</H6></DIV><DIV class="row col-lg-offset-3 image_container col-lg-3 imagebox"><H5 class="subtitle"><B>Figure 3-12. Our candy carrying ALDH2*1-<I>Ec</I>N converts acetaldehyde faster than its ALDH2*2 counterpart.</B> To simulate realistic conditions, the candy was first dissolved (like it would in the mouth) before the <I>Ec</I>N cell extracts were tested. A candy that did not contain any bacteria served as a negative control. The results show that our probiotic candy is effective under realistic conditions and can successfully metabolize acetaldehyde. Error bars represent standard error. (Experiment &amp; Figure: Justin W)

      Next, we used <A href=" https://2018.igem.org/Team:TAS_Taipei/Model" class="_" target="_blank">mathematical modeling</A> to model how fast acetaldehyde is being made and metabolized in the mouth after alcohol consumption. With this information, we determined how much additional ALDH2*1 a deficient individual would need to process acetaldehyde at wild type rates. <B>We determined that 1.839*10<SUP>-9</SUP> mol of ALDH2*1 enzymes or an equivalent amount inside ALDH2*1-<I>Ec</I>N probiotics (2.67 mg) would be packaged into one candy</B>, which can be used for 15 minutes. While eating the candy, a consumer would be able to metabolize acetaldehyde at wild type rates.</H6></DIV><DIV class="row"><P class="dote col-lg-offset-3" id="refer">.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><H1 class="col-lg-12 col-lg-offset-3 paddingremovaly" id="aboutourschool">REFERENCES</H1></DIV><DIV class="row"><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 description paddingremovaly">
