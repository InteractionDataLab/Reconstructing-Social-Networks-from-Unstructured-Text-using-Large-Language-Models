BEST NEW BASIC PART
Our best new basic part is BBa_K2539150 : the protein-coding gene ALDH2*1. This gene codes for human mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2), ALDH2*1 is the wild type form, which is responsible for oxidizing acetaldehyde, a toxic intermediate of ethanol metabolism, into harmless acetic acid (Larson et al., 2005; Farrés et al., 1994). We were able to test and validate ALDH2*1’s ability to metabolize acetaldehyde. The design and characterization of BBa_K2539150 are documented below.
Part Design
We modified the ALDH2*1 sequence (NCBI: NM_001204889.1) to remove an internal PstI site.
PCR Check Results
The part was confirmed by PCR using the primers VF2 and VR, as well as sequencing by Tri-I Biotech.
BBa_K2539150 contains just the sequence of ALDH2*1. PCR check using VF2 and VR primers produced a band at the expected size of 1.8 kb (yellow box).(Cloning & Figures: Catherine C)
Characterization
We tested the enzyme function of ALDH2*1 (BBa_K2539150) by placing it under the control of a constitutive promoter (BBa_K2539100). We compared ALDH2*1 (the wild type) activity to ALDH2*2 (the mutant) activity. ALDH2*1 should convert acetaldehyde to acetate faster than the mutant form.
Testing enzyme function in cell lysates:
When ALDH2 converts acetaldehyde into acetate, NADH is produced. To test the ability of recombinant ALDH2*1 to metabolize acetaldehyde, we used reagents from a kit (Megazyme, K-ACHYD) to quantify the amount of NADH produced by taking absorbance readings at 340 nm. This wavelength is highly absorbed by the reduced form, NADH, but not the oxidized form, NAD+ (Harimech et al., 2015; McComb et al., 1976). High absorbance values would indicate more conversion of acetaldehyde into acetate.
The wild type ALDH2*1 converts acetaldehyde at a faster rate than mutant ALDH2*2. (A) The conversion of acetaldehyde to acetate by ALDH2 uses NAD+ and produces NADH. (B) Experimental setup. The supernatant from ALDH2-expressing E. coli cell lysates was mixed with acetaldehyde and NAD+ to initiate the reaction at 25°C. NADH concentration was measured by taking absorbance readings at 340 nm. (C) Relative activity of lysates containing either ALDH2*1, ALDH2*2, or inactive ALDH2*1 (boiled to denature proteins; negative control). Error bars represent standard error.

Over a 40 minute period, E. coli carrying the ALDH2*1-expressing construct (BBa_K2539100) produced more NADH than the mutant form (BBa_K2539200), while the negative control (boiled BBa_K2539100) did not change significantly. This shows that wild type ALDH2*1 is more efficient at metabolizing acetaldehyde compared to the mutant ALDH2*2.
Testing enzyme function of purified samples:
To purify ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2 enzymes, we added HIS-tags to the DNA designs (BBa_K2539101 and BBa_K2539201). We repeated our functional test using purified enzymes (results shown below), and saw a much clearer difference between ALDH2*1 (BBa_K2539150) and ALDH2*2 (BBa_K2539250), compared to when we used bacterial cell extracts. In our tests, purified ALDH2*2 did not have any effect on NADH, while purified ALDH2*1 significantly increased NADH levels.
Purified ALDH2*1 has a much higher activity level compared to purified ALDH2*2. Using the same procedure, we tested the enzymatic activity of purified ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2 at 25°C. A negative control containing only elution buffer (from the protein purification process) was also included (gray). ALDH2*1 steadily metabolized more acetaldehyde compared to both ALDH2*2 and the negative control, both of which did not seem to have any effect. The error bars represent standard error, and are bolded for ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2 to highlight the difference between the two groups. (Experiment & Figure: Justin W)
