We created a Python program that can be used to help researchers easily model reaction rates involving any two-step sequential enzymatic reactions, where a different enzyme catalyzes each step. Our software assumes both enzymes obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Researchers only have to input initial enzyme and substrate concentrations and the enzymatic activity in order to create an easy-to-visualize plot of substrate concentrations vs. time. Researchers can follow the documented directions on our wiki to change or add variables specific to their enzymatic reactions, in order to get the graphs of substrate concentrations over time they wish to model. We licensed our program with the OSI approved MIT License.

We set it as equal to the conversion rate of ethanol to acetaldehyde (d Ethanol/dt) minus the enzymatic activity of ALDH2 enzymes. The acetaldehyde elimination rate (AER) and km are constant values that vary for different ALDH2 genotypes. For example, a person who is homozygous wild type (ALDH2*1/*1) has an AER of 2.1 µM/sec and a Km of 0.2 µM (Rashkovetsky et al, 1994).  The symbol [A] represents acetaldehyde concentration. <B>This differential equation corresponds to the conversion rate of Substrate 2 to the Product in Figure 1-1.</B></H5></DIV><DIV class="row"><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 description paddingremovaly">There are three different ALDH2 genotypes (homozygous wild type ALDH2*1/*1; heterozygous ALDH2*1/*2; homozygous mutant ALDH2*2/*2), which process acetaldehyde at different rates (different Vmax values). Based on literature, we know that the heterozygous functions at 20-40% efficiency compared to homozygous wild type, while the homozygous mutant functions at 1-4% efficiency. The graphs below reflect the different efficiencies (20% and 1% were used to assume the worst case scenarios for the two mutant genotypes) (Gross <I>et al</I>., 2014; Chen <I>et al</I>., 2014).</H6></DIV><DIV class="row col-lg-offset-3 image_containerm4 col-lg-3 imagebox"><H5 class="subtitlem4"><B>Figure 1-2.
