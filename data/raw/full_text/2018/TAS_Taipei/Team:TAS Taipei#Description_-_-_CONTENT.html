ALDH2 deficiency, more commonly known as Alcohol Flushing Syndrome or Asian Glow, is a genetic condition which interferes with the metabolism of alcohol (Figure 1-1). Normally, ethanol is first converted to acetaldehyde (a toxic intermediate) by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Then, acetaldehyde is converted to acetate, which can be safely metabolized in the body, by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). People with ALDH2 deficiency, however, have a point mutation in the gene, which produces a less efficient ALDH2 (mutant: ALDH2*2) by lowering the binding affinity to its coenzyme NAD+ (Larson <I>et al.</I>, 2005; Farrés <I>et al.</I>, 1994). The enzymatic activity in individuals who are deficient can be as low as 4% compared to normal ALDH2 (wild type: ALDH2*1) activity (Chen <I>et al.</I>, 2014; Zhou &amp; Weiner, 2000; Farrés <I>et al.</I>, 1994). As a result, acetaldehyde accumulates and induces an inflammatory reaction that causes the skin to flush or appear red after drinking alcohol (Ijiri, 1999). Facial flushing is the most obvious result of ALDH2 deficiency, but symptoms also include “headaches, nausea, dizziness, and cardiac palpitations after consumption of alcoholic beverages” (Chen <I>et al.</I>, 2014).
 </H6><DIV class="row col-lg-offset-3 image_container col-lg-3 imagebox"><H5 class="subtitle"><B>Figure 1-1: Acetaldehyde accumulates in ALDH2 deficient individuals.</B> Ethanol is first converted to a toxic intermediate, acetaldehyde, by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). For individuals with wild type ALDH2, acetaldehyde is converted to acetate by ALDH2*1. However, people who are ALDH2 deficient carry the mutant ALDH2*2, which cannot fully convert acetaldehyde into acetate, and acetaldehyde accumulates as a result. (Figure: Caroline C)

ALDH2 deficiency affects 540 million people--8% of the world population. In East Asia (which includes Japan, China, and Korea), this is a much bigger problem, where the number rises to 36% (Brooks <I>et al.</I>, 2009). In our home, Taiwan, approximately 47% of the population carries this genetic mutation--the highest ALDH2 deficient percentage in the world (Chang <I>et al.</I>, 2017).

One of the biggest problems of ALDH2 deficiency is that while people recognize that flushing occurs, they are not aware that it is actually dangerous. According to our survey, which sampled close to 700 people around Taipei, many people misunderstood the causes and effects of alcohol flushing. For example, many people thought that turning red is the result of low alcohol tolerance, healthy liver functions, and fast metabolism--this is the opposite of the truth! These findings suggest a need for more public awareness about the health implications of ALDH2 deficiency. (To see our survey results, click <A href=" https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2018/b/b3/T--TAS_Taipei--SurveyResults.pdf

) 

Turning red after consuming alcohol may seem like a mere social inconvenience. Yet, behind this red complexion lies a far more serious problem. The <B>International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies acetaldehyde associated with alcohol consumption as a Group 1 carcinogen</B> (IARC, n.d.). Alcohol and acetaldehyde have been shown to reduce thymidine incorporation into DNA, interfering with DNA synthesis (Dreosti <I>et al.</I>, 1981; Seitz &amp; Stickel, 2010). In other studies with human lymphocyte cells, acetaldehyde increased chromosome damage or the frequency of sister-chromatid exchanges (Obe <I>et al.</I>, 1986; Helander &amp; Lindahl-Kiessling, 1991; Maffei <I>et al.</I>, 2002). When rats were exposed to acetaldehyde, inhalation led to abnormal changes in the nasal mucous membrane, such as degeneration of the tissue, increased cell proliferation, and the development of carcinomas (Woutersen <I>et al.</I>, 1986).                                                                                                   

 </H6><DIV class="row col-lg-offset-3 image_container col-lg-3 imagebox"><H5 class="subtitle"><B>Figure 1-2: There are 14 grams of ethanol in each serving of alcohol,</B> which is around 148 mL of wine, 355 mL of beer, and 44 mL of spirit such as whiskey or tequila (NIAAA, n.d). (Figure: Caroline C) 
</H5></DIV><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 description paddingremovaly indent">
Acetaldehyde levels over 50 μM are considered toxic and cause mutations in DNA (Yamaguchi <I>et al.</I>, 2012; Kocaelli <I>et al.</I>, 2014). In human studies where roughly 2 to 3 servings of alcohol (0.5-0.6 g alcohol/kg body weight) were ingested (Figure 1-2), salivary acetaldehyde levels in some individuals increased to over 100 μM (Homann <I>et al.</I>, 1997a; Yokoyama <I>et al.</I>, 2008), compared to normal levels of &lt;20 μM without drinking (Lachenmeier &amp; Monakhova, 2011). For people who carry normal, functional ALDH2*1, acetaldehyde can quickly get broken down (Figure 1-3).</H6><DIV class="row col-lg-offset-3 image_containerf1 col-lg-3 imagebox"><H5 class="subtitlef1"><B>Figure 1-3: Salivary acetaldehyde levels are much higher in heterozygous (ALDH2*1/*2) individuals, compared to homozygous wild type (ALDH2*1/*1) individuals.</B> Acetaldehyde levels were recorded after drinking 0.6 g ethanol/kg body weight. Salivary acetaldehyde levels are also significantly higher than blood acetaldehyde after drinking (Figure from Yokoyama <I>et al.</I>, 2008).
</H5></DIV><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 description paddingremovaly indent">
For those who are ALDH2 deficient <B>and</B> drink, however, acetaldehyde can accumulate to toxic levels. The strongest effects are seen in the mouth. Studies show that after alcohol consumption, salivary acetaldehyde levels are significantly higher than blood acetaldehyde levels (Stornetta <I>et al.</I>, 2018; Yokoyama <I>et al.</I>, 2008) (Figure 1-3).  Since there are other aldehyde dehydrogenases (such as ALDH1A1; Ueshima <I>et al.</I>, 1993) throughout the body that can help metabolize acetaldehyde, blood acetaldehyde concentrations remain relatively low. Most importantly, ALDH2 levels are much higher in the liver, which can break down most acetaldehyde before it enters the bloodstream (Oyama <I>et al.</I>, 2005). Maybe because of this, ALDH2 deficiency does not seem to be directly associated with the development of liver, breast, colorectal, or other common alcohol-related cancers (Väkeväinen <I>et al.</I>, 2000; Chang <I>et al.</I>, 2017). 

These results could also explain why the effects of ALDH2 deficiency are mainly localized rather than widespread throughout the body. <B>Heightened salivary acetaldehyde levels increase the risks of developing esophageal and head and neck cancers.</B><I>In vivo</I> studies with rats have shown that acetaldehyde administered orally has a tumor-promoting effect (abnormally fast cell growth and division) on the upper respiratory-digestive tract (Homann <I>et al.</I>, 1997b). Depending on how much alcohol is consumed, <B>people with ALDH2 deficiency are two to eight times more likely to develop head and neck cancers </B> (which includes oral cancer, pharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer, etc.), and <B>two to twelve times<CLASS id="CurrentSolutions"> more likely to develop esophageal cancer</CLASS></B> compared to people with normal ALDH2*1 (Chao <I>et al.</I>, 2000; Yang <I>et al.</I>, 2007; Yokoyama, 2001; Matsuo <I>et al.</I>, 2001; Cui <I>et al.</I>, 2009; Lee <I>et al.</I>, 2007; Wu <I>et al.</I>, 2013; Huang <I>et al.</I>, 2017; Hiraki <I>et al.</I>, 2007). </H6><DIV class="row"><H2 class="col-lg-12 col-lg-offset-3 paddingremovaly">CURRENT SOLUTIONS</H2></DIV><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 description paddingremovaly indent">
Today, the solutions for treating flushing include simply using cosmetics to conceal the flushing, or using antihistamines to prevent the release of histamines, which leads to the resulting redness (Chrostek <I>et al.</I>, 2007; Miller <I>et al.</I>, 1998; Quertemont <I>et al.</I>, 2006; Eriksson, 2001). 

These solutions, however, do not actually address the buildup of acetaldehyde, the main contributor to increased esophageal and head and neck cancers (Sunset, n.d.; Essential AD2, n.d.). On the contrary, these options may actually increase health risks, as they conceal the visible symptoms without reducing acetaldehyde levels (Brooks <I>et al.</I>, 2009).<CLASS id="OurGoal">Other treatments include antioxidants that may directly interact with acetaldehyde, but these mainly focused on reducing acetaldehyde accumulation in the blood, instead of directly treating the acetaldehyde accumulation in saliva (Essential AD2, n.d.; Vogt &amp; Richie, 2007).
