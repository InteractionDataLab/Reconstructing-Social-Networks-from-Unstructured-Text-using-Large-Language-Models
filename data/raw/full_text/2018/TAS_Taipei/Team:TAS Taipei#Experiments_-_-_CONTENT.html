We genetically engineered <I>Escherichia coli (E. coli) </I> to constitutively produce normal ALDH2*1, and experimentally show that our recombinant ALDH2*1 is more efficient at breaking down acetaldehyde compared to the mutant ALDH2*2. To better characterize enzymatic activity, we also designed, purified, and tested both HIS-tagged ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2 enzymes. Finally, we designed and tested an ethanol-induced promoter to regulate the production of ALDH2*1.

ALDH2 is a mitochondrial enzyme responsible for oxidizing acetaldehyde, a toxic intermediate of ethanol metabolism, into harmless acetic acid (Figure 2-1) (Larson <I>et al.</I>, 2005; Farrés <I>et al.</I>, 1994). <B>Our goal is to produce recombinant normal ALDH2*1 enzyme to help prevent the toxic buildup of acetaldehyde in ALDH2 deficient individuals.</B></H6></DIV><DIV class="row col-lg-offset-3 image_container col-lg-3 imagebox"><H5 class="subtitle"><B>Figure 2-1. Acetaldehyde accumulates in ALDH2 deficient individuals. </B>Ethanol is first converted to a toxic intermediate, acetaldehyde, by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). For individuals with wild type ALDH2, acetaldehyde is converted to acetate by ALDH2*1. However, people who are ALDH2 deficient carry the mutant ALDH2*2, which cannot fully convert acetaldehyde into acetate, and acetaldehyde accumulates as a result. (Figure: Caroline C)

        We obtained the DNA sequence of ALDH2*1, which has also been documented on the registry (BBa_M36520; NCBI: NM_001204889.1), and modified it to remove an internal PstI site and lower the guanine and cytosine content (ALDH2*1 basic part: BBa_K2539150, Figure 2-2), as recommended by Integrated DNA Technology (IDT). The sequence was then flanked by an upstream strong promoter and strong ribosome binding site (RBS) combination (BBa_K880005), and a downstream double terminator (BBa_B0015) to maximize expression of ALDH2*1 enzyme (Figure 2-2). This final construct was ordered from IDT and cloned into the standard pSB1C3 Biobrick backbone (BBa_K2539100; Figure 2-2). PCR check and sequencing results from Tri-I Biotech indicate that our final construct is correct.

The ALDH2*2 gene consists of a single G to A point mutation; this leads to a change in codon 487, where GAA (coding for glutamic acid) is mutated to AAA (coding for lysine) (Figure 2-4; Enomoto <I>et al.</I>, 1991). The nucleotide was changed in our DNA designs, and this ALDH2*2 sequence was similarly placed between the strong promoter and strong RBS combination (BBa_K880005) and a downstream double terminator (BBa_B0015) to maximize expression (Figure 2-4).

With both forms of ALDH2 prepared, we could compare the enzymatic activity of wild type ALDH2*1 to the mutant ALDH2*2. When ALDH2 converts acetaldehyde into acetate, NADH is produced (Figure 2-5, A). To test the ability of our recombinant ALDH2 to metabolize acetaldehyde, we used reagents from a kit (Megazyme, K-ACHYD) to quantify the amount of NADH produced by taking absorbance readings at 340 nm. This wavelength is highly absorbed by the reduced form, NADH, but not the oxidized form, NAD+ (Harimech <I>et al.</I>, 2015; McComb <I>et al.</I>, 1976). We expected to see both forms of ALDH2 metabolize acetaldehyde, and as a result, produce NADH, but ALDH2*1 should be more efficient compared to ALDH2*2.

        Bacterial liquid cultures were prepared, and the populations were standardized by measuring the OD600 of each culture, and then diluting cultures appropriately to achieve the same population in all samples. Next, the cultures were spun down, and the pellets were resuspended in xTractor Lysis Buffer (Takara Bio, 635671) in order to lyse the cells. After lysis, the supernatant containing proteins was transferred into quartz cuvettes containing a pH 9.0 buffer, distilled water, and excess NAD+ (all solutions were provided by the kit) (Figure 2-5, B). Acetaldehyde was added to initiate the reaction, and absorbance values at 340 nm were recorded for 40 minutes. As a negative control, cell lysates of <I>E. coli</I> expressing ALDH2*1 were boiled to denature all proteins. 

Over a 40 minute period, <B>the absorbance at 340 nm increased faster for ALDH2*1 compared to ALDH2*2</B>, but did not significantly change for the negative control (inactive ALDH2*1) (Figure 2-5, C). Our results show that functional ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2 are being produced, and there is a significant difference in the acetaldehyde metabolism rate (the error bars do not overlap, Figure 2-5, C). However, the error bars were close, so we decided to purify the proteins to see if we could observe a greater difference in enzyme activity between the wild type and mutant ALDH2.<DIV class="row"><P class="dote col-lg-offset-3" id="wiki&amp;graphicdesign1">.</P></DIV></H6></DIV><DIV class="row"><H1 class="col-lg-12 col-lg-offset-3 paddingremovaly" id="aboutourschool">PURIFICATION OF ALDH2*1</H1></DIV><DIV class="row"><H6 class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-3 description indent paddingremovaly">

To purify the HIS-tagged proteins, we grew cultures of <I>E. coli</I> expressing HIS-tagged ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2. The bacterial cultures were centrifuged, lysed, and filtered before the cell extract sample was run through a nickel column (GE Healthcare, 11-0033-99). HIS-tagged proteins should bind to the column, which contained nickel ions. Then, we ran a low-concentration imidazole buffer through the column to wash out any non-specific proteins. Finally, we eluted and collected the HIS-ALDH2 proteins by running a high-concentration imidazole concentration buffer through the column (imidazole competes with the HIS tag to bind with nickel ions in the column) (Bornhorst <I>et al.</I>, 2000). We used SDS-PAGE to check protein content at different steps of the purification process: lysed cell sample, flow-through after the wash buffer, and final eluate containing the purified protein (Figure 2-7). HIS-tagged ALDH2*1 should be around 56 kDa. In the initial cell lysate lane, there is a band around 56 kDa (Figure 2-7). This band disappears in the wash buffer flow-through lane, and reappears in the eluate. A similar band around 50 kDa was also seen in the eluate when we purified ALDH2*2 (Figure 2-7). For both HIS-tagged samples, there are also some other proteins in the eluate, but our gels show that <B>we now have much purer samples of both HIS-tagged ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2,</B> which should give clearer results in our functional test.

We repeated our functional test using purified enzymes (Figure 2-8), and saw a much clearer difference between ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2, compared to when we used bacterial cell extracts. When cell extracts were tested, ALDH2*1 seemed to work slightly better, but NADH concentrations increased for both ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2. When the cell extracts were removed, however, <B>purified ALDH2*2 did not have any effect on NADH, while purified ALDH2*1 significantly increased NADH levels</B> (Figure 2-8). This result seems logical and matches research which show that when only the mutant ALDH2*2 is present, enzymatic activity can drop down to a mere 4% compared to normal ALDH2*1 (Gross <I>et al.</I>, 2015). This also shows that the increase seen with ALDH2*2 cell extracts (Figure 2-5) was likely due to other enzymes in the bacteria that also reduce NAD+ and produce NADH.

When we surveyed the public about their preferences for treatment, most people indicated that they prefer treatment <I>only</I> when they drink (instead of daily, weekly, etc.). We had the same thought--we wanted to regulate expression so that ALDH2 is only made in the presence of ethanol.

PalcA (BBa_K2092001) is an ethanol-induced promoter that also requires the binding of a transcription factor, alcR, in order to be activated (Figure 2-9).

We used green fluorescence protein (GFP) as a reporter to test the function of PalcA. The GFP sequence was placed behind the PalcA promoter, a strong RBS (BBa_B0034), and before a double terminator (BBa_B0015) to express GFP in the presence of ethanol and alcR (PalcA_GFP: BBa_K2539500; Figure 2-10). We then cloned PalcA_GFP (BBa_K2539500) and Pconst_alcR (BBa_K2539300) together into pSB1C3 to make BBa_K2539550. All sequences were confirmed by PCR check (Figure 2-10) and Tri-I Biotech. 

We tested <I>E. coli</I> carrying Pconst_alcR+PalcA_GFP (BBa_K2539550) using different concentrations of ethanol (Figure 2-11). Bacterial cultures with different plasmids were grown overnight.

An initial fluorescence reading was taken using a 96 well plate reader. Next, different amounts of ethanol were added to each tube, the tubes were sealed to prevent evaporation, and left in a shaking incubator for 24 hours. A final measurement was taken, again using a 96 well plate reader, to detect any changes in fluorescence.  If PalcA is functional, then we should see Pconst_alcR+PalcA_GFP (BBa_K2539550) cultures glow green in the presence of ethanol.

Our results matched the general expected trend (Figure 2-11). Addition of 0.3 g of ethanol to Pconst_alcR+PalcA_GFP (BBa_K2539550) seemed to yield the highest fluorescence, and lower amounts of  0.01 g and 0.1 g ethanol were not significantly different than the controls (LB only, Pconst_alcR, and PalcA_GFP). Over 0.5 g of ethanol seemed to kill the bacteria (3 mL of culture), which matches literature thresholds of ethanol tolerance (Chong <I>et al.</I>, 2013).
