We separated our Human Practices into three categories: Research, Impact, and Outreach.
RESEARCH
Our project this year was inspired by a guest speaker, Dr. Che-Hong Chen, who visited our school to talk about his research on alcohol flushing syndrome (more commonly known as Asian glow). To learn more about ALDH2 deficiency, public opinion, and how to develop a feasible product, we spoke to various experts and reached out to our community.

TAIES
TAIES, a non-profit organization founded by Dr. Che-Hong Chen, aims to educate the general public about ALDH2 Deficiency. In March 2018, TAIES and the Taiwan Federation of Medical Students co-hosted a 2-day workshop for over 80 student participants from different medical schools.
Public Opinion
Bioethics Roundtable
In February, we hosted a Bioethics Roundtable, where we invited students and teachers to discuss the social, ethical, and medical aspects of our project. Hoping to generate discussion and new perspectives, we developed a set of questions, assigned different roles to participants, and asked for opinions from the respective views of each assigned role.
An example:
“Should ALDH2 testing be a free test service for people? In what form would you want ALDH2 testing to be available? Kit? Hospital testings? Who should pay for the test?”
The designated roles for this question included Government Official, College Student, Hospital Administrator, Employer, and Alcohol Manufacturer.
There was no apparent preference for home-kits versus hospital tests, but a strong preference for tests to be covered by the government through the National Health Insurance. Some hospital administrators even suggested that the government should raise taxes on alcohol in order to fund these tests. On the other hand, government officials argued that the government should not be held responsible for providing testing services because drinking is a personal choice.
We also asked participants their opinions on ALDH2 deficiency and suggestions for ways to distribute our product in the future. (Whole team activity)

Policy Brief
While researching for our project, we discovered that 47% of the Taiwanese population is ALDH2 deficient, the highest percentage in the world! ALDH2 deficiency results in a buildup of acetaldehyde, a Group 1 carcinogen, which may lead to a greater risk of developing head, neck, and esophageal cancers. Despite the serious health implications and the high percentage of ALDH2 deficient people, we were surprised to find out that most Taiwanese people were not aware of this issue.
Concerned about the large ALDH2 deficient population in Taiwan, we tried to look for policies aimed to educate the public about alcohol consumption and their ramifications on health. We found that little attention has been paid to this matter in terms of policy and regulation. For example, unlike cigarette health warning labels, alcohol products lack similar rigid health-oriented labels, despite having similar detrimental impacts on health. We also surveyed several alcohol manufacturers on their labeling practices and looked at alcohol warning labels at supermarkets and convenience stores. Only about half of the labels directly linked excessive drinking to negative health effects.
Using tobacco regulations as a model, we composed a policy brief with suggestions for modifying current alcohol labeling practices. We seek to inform more people about the health effects of excessive alcohol consumption. Click here to read our policy brief!
Our policy brief was sent to two Taiwanese government agencies: the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Click here to view their responses!

Education
7th Grade
Our team taught the basics of synthetic biology and common lab techniques to over 200 seventh graders. Using dyes, students learned how to pipette and run agarose gel electrophoresis. We also conducted an activity where students were given theoretical scenarios and simulated DNA parts (promoters, open reading frames, etc.). Based on each scenario, they combined different parts into full constructs.
Kindergarten
We introduced kindergarteners to science with four simple activities. In one activity, we taught them how to use a microscope to observe the intricate details on a 100 NTD bill. In another, we used balloons to introduce them to “invisible forces” such as static electricity and electrical charges.

Our School
In our school, all ninth grade students are required to take a health class which already discusses the negative effects of alcohol consumption. We felt it was also important for students to be aware of the increased cancer risks and the large ALDH2 deficient population in Taiwan, so we spoke about this in several health classes and class meetings.

NYMU
We work in the Sandy R. Puckett Memorial Research Lab, which was completely renovated in 2013 to provide a research laboratory for on-campus student research in chemistry, synthetic biology and nanotechnology. It is fully equipped with lab tools for research for the iGEM competition. The students have the opportunity to be creative and exploratory in many areas of scientific research at TAS.
