In order to ensure that the Ginga works effectively, the whole pipeline, from start to finish, was validated with some real world
                      public data from melanoma patients. Although, this data was extremely useful to understand the workflow and requirements of the pipeline it is limited and doesn’t contemplate the full potential of Ginga. Nevertheless, accessing patient
                      data have been proven to be extremely difficult due to the lack of the necessary ethical assessment and stiff data protection policies of sequenced data. However, the team has plans to validate Ginga with additional data and we are
                      already in progress of completing an application for International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) regulated by the Data Access Compliance Office (DACO). The study we are interested in contains WES data from 52 melanoma patients
                      and matched normal samples. We hope to gain access to this data to be able to keep supporting and improving Ginga.
                    </P><P class="lead">On the other hand, the ethical considerations regarding the used of patient data were carefully evaluated and all the data protection protocols were correctly assessed and followed. The datasets are completely anonymised and have no
                      identification that could lead or allow the tracking of the origin patient. Furthermore, we have disclose the data and the results made available for the community are processed and cannot be used to reconstruct the full genome of
                      the patient. Furthermore, the whole data was safely secured in AWS cloud storage and encrypted. The raw sequences were never stored in any local drive. Once the data has fulfilled its purpose, the raw data will be completely and
                      safely remove from any device or cloud storage.

The samples were extracted from a study from Department of Molecular Biology of Cancer, Medical University of Lodz, Poland (ID: PRJEB27635).
                  The study contains whole exome sequencing data from 8 different melanoma patients according to the following description: Melanoma specimens were obtained during surgical interventions, and grown in vitro in serum-free EGF/bFGF-containing
                  medium as described previously (Sztiller-Sikorska et al., 2012 Melanoma Research). DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit from Qiagen according to manufacturer protocol. DNA samples were subjected to Nextera tagmentation followed
                  by index PCR, first hybridization, capture, washes, elution, second hybridization, capture, washes, elution and enrichment of DNA fragments. The samples were subjected to two rounds of exome enrichment, followed by real-time PCR quantification
                  (KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Kit) prior to sequencing.

                </P><P class="lead">The samples were sequenced using NextSeq 500 sequencing of the cell DNA after in-vitro culture.

Documentation and details on how to use this packages can be found <A href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/">here</A>. In general,
                  the data from the study appears to show good general indices, with a good overall GC content, in the lower end of the expected 45-50% range of typical exome sequences (MacKinnon). At the same time, the large base size of around 100 times
                  bigger than a typical human exome, showing good coverage of the reads.</P><H1 id="limitations">Limitations of the Dataset</H1><P class="lead">Before starting the analysis there are a few notes to point out about the use of this dataset. First, the accuracy of the genomic analysis highly depends on decoding the and subtracting the noise and artifacts generated during the sequencing
                  protocol (Wang et al.). Furthermore, other characteristics, such as coverage, index adapters, number of flow-cells among other parameters are key to avoid false positives. The samples contained in the study PRJEB27635, have limited information
                  about these characteristics, which only allow to make assumptions based on the observations of other parameters. This makes the validation process shown in this part more conversome.</P><P class="lead">Furthermore, In order to precisely find all the mutations contained in the genome and avoid any bias originated by the sequencing protocol or the genomic analysis, a matched normal sample from the patient is required. The study PRJEB27635
                  does not contain any normal samples and hence the tumor and normal samples cannot be directly compared to detect the mutations. However, recent developments in the tools allow the use of only the tumor sample (Teer et al.)
                </P><H1 id="assessment">Quality Assessment - FastQC Analysis</H1><P class="lead">The data was pre-analysed using FastQC (Version 0.11.7). The program outputs a summary of different metrics of the reads and signals with a flag the scores that are suboptimal for genomic analysis. In general the results show good quality
                  of the reads, with overall good per base sequence quality and Per tile sequence quality for all the patient’s data. Furthermore, the per sequence quality score follows the typical trend for good illumina sequence data as seen in Figure
                  1. This implies that the data was collected accordingly and it represents the overall field of view of the targeted data. However, FastQC report shows three metrics that are consistently poor for all the samples in the study. These are
                  per base sequence content.
                </P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION class="mt-3 text-muted">Figure 1. Per sequence quality score for sample ERR2683866. The other samples in the study follow similar trends.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P class="lead">All samples contained an irregular profile of per base sequence content. The per base sequence content represents the relative amount of each base in your genome. Normally, in correctly sequenced data this value should be maintained constant
                  throughout the genome. In the data obtained from the study the difference between A and T, or G and C is greater than 20% in certain position especially concentrated at the end of the library. This results can have several implications
                  in the data to analyse. Often, this errors are caused by the presence of overrepresented sequences such as sequencing adapter dimers use to index and sort the Illumina reads, this can often bias the data and cause unrealistic results
                  (Andrews). This suggest that the adapter primers are contained in the sequences. However, by looking at the Overrepresented sequences metric in report none of the datasets seem to contain any heavily repeated sequences. On the other
                  hand, the low score of the per base sequence content can be attributed to a aggressive trimming of adapters that can introduce bias in the library. This typically occurs at the end of the reads (Andrews). The per base sequence content
                  for the study reads as seen in Figure 2, seem to be extensively trimmed as the sequence content at the end of the reads deviate from the general trend. This is further confirm by the GC content of the data which shows a deviation from
                  the normal distribution of more than 15% of the reads (Andrews).

                </P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION class="mt-3 text-muted">Figure 2 - Sequence content across bases for sample ERR2683866. The samples in the study follow similar trends.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P class="lead">Sequence Duplication levels were also found to be abnormal, since non-unique sequences make up more than 20% of the total library for all the samples. This can be appreciated by high duplication peaks in the center of Figure 3. FastQC
                  also calculates the overall loss of the sequence for the library after removal of the duplicated sequences, found on the title of Figure 3. For the sample ERR2683866, the non-duplicated sequences represent 65.2% of the total library.
                  This might be due to specific PCR enrichment during the sequencing process (Andrews). </P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION class="mt-3 text-muted">Figure 3 - Sequence Duplication levels for sample ERR2683866. Similar trends were observed in the other samples of this study.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P class="lead">Based on the output of these reports the pipeline was optimized to ensure that any possible adapters that might affect GC sequence content or Per base sequence content are removed, using BBmap or Trimmomatic. Furthermore, given the high
                  content of duplicate reads its necessary to ensure that the library is filtered to remove any bias information that can affect the final outcome. Duplicate reads were filtered using MarkDuplicates package in picard tools.
                </P><H1 id="sequencing">Sequencing Adapter Cut and Quality Control - Trimmomatic/BBmap</H1><P class="lead">The sequences were analysed using BBmap (v38.36) and Trimmomatic (v0.38), to remove any sequencing adapters related to the reads (Bolger, Lohse and Usadel 2114-2120). Usually sequence data contains adapters used for indexing and sorting
                  the reads in the genome. Normally, is ideal to use the specific adapter-sets according to the technique used to perform the sequencing. TruSeq is commonly used for performing this analysis, however, the original method of extraction
                  of the libraries of study PRJEB27635, are not known which makes the task of assessing the quality of reads a challenge. In order to ensure that the analysis is complete, Ginga implements both Trimmomatic and BBmap trimming tools.
                </P><P class="lead">All samples were analysed using Trimmomatic (v0.38). To remove the adapters the Trimmomatic was run using the single end mode (SE) and IlluminaClip was initially performed using the standard parameters (seedMismatches = 2, palindromeClipThreshold
                  = 30 and simpleClipThreshold = 10) and the universal adapters contained in the TruSeq v3 single end adapters which can be found in the table below (Table 1). With the above parameters, no sequences were clipped from the raw initial sequences.
                  The method was repeated, in order to optimize the parameters. seedMismatches was maintained at 2 bp since TruSeq v3 adapters are particularly short and enriching the bias towards mismatched sequences can lead to deletion of exonic information
                  (Bolger, Lohse and Usadel 2114-2120). The other quality control options of Trimmomatic were not used, since the FastQC report of the library shows good overall base per quality and distribution, however they are recommended.

                </P><P class="lead">To ensure that the sequences were not containing no other bias, other typical adapters were used, including NextEra [ID:5-6] and TrueSeq [ID:3-4]. AmpliSeq adapter trimming, typically used for creating large cancer panels was also tested

						In order to assess the feasibility of our vaccine production scheme, we performed different experiments. First, we will demonstrate that it is possible to express encapsulin in a home-made cell-free system. Next, we will modify Encapsulin for the purpose of increasing its heat stability following the research done by <A href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25180761"><SPAN style="color:blue">Moon <I>et al.</I>, 2014.</SPAN></A>Then, we will demonstrate a rapid and efficient purification method of the expressed protein nanocompartments. In order to allow for the generation of neoantigen-presenting encapsulin, we will generate plasmid constructs for the rapid genetic integration of neoantigen sequences. This platform will be tested by the production of the model encapsulin-OT-1 protein nanoparticle, which will be extensively characterized by common techniques and ultimately by its action on dendritic cells.

                  image suggests that we have a fluorescent band just below the 32 kDa ladder band, for both HH encapsulin B and HH encapsulin S, but not in the negative control (N.C. in Fig. 1). This indicates the presence of encapsulin at its expected

This test would allow a doctor to regularly check for the presence of this relapse indicator.</P><P class="lead">We decided to base our assay on the very well documented Philadelphia chromosome, which is a classic example of chromosomal rearrangement.</P><P class="lead">This translocation is characterized by the transfer of a part of the chromosome 9 on the chromosome 22 (<A href="#deKlein1982"><SPAN style="color:blue">de Klein <I>et al.</I>, 1982</SPAN></A>). This chromosomal rearrangement is often
                      called <B>Bcr-Abl</B>, as these are the two genes that are fused together. More specifically, we want to detect a 17-base-pair-long sequence right where those two genes are fused, which is also called “the junction”.</P><CENTER><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION class="mt-3 text-muted"><B>Figure 11.</B> Representation of the Philadelphia chromosome which we detect in plasma using our Cas12a assay.

To do so, after some trials in buffer, we set out to amplify the junction using PCR from plasma followed by our usual Cas12a assay
                      (more details in the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:EPFL/Protocols"><SPAN style="color:blue">Protocols</SPAN></A>) and observe different fluorescence signals depending on the presence or not of the junction.</P><CENTER><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION class="mt-3 text-muted"><B>Figure 12.</B> Representation of the Bcr-Abl fragments with the targeted junction in addition to the Abl and Bcr fragments.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></CENTER><H4>Detection of Bcr-Abl using our Cas12a assay</H4><CENTER><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION class="mt-3 text-muted"><B>Figure 13.</B> Representation of the translocation experiment.

The signal is about 7 times higher in the mutated gene sample than in the sample containing Bcr or Abl. It implies that the amplification step worked
                      and did add the required PAM sequence for Cas12a activation. </P><H2>Conclusions</H2><P class="lead">Our goal was to be able to distinguish samples which contained our chromosomal rearrangement compared to the ones whose nucleic acid sequences originate from a healthy genome. We succeeded in differentiating them after amplification
                      in plasma.</P><P class="lead">Ideally we would have wanted to see how sensitive our system was by lowering the concentration of template DNA added in the plasma. Our plan was to make a multiplex device allowing to test relapse emergence using many different chromosomal
                      rearrangements, point mutation and miRNA that could easily be used in smaller clinics and hospitals. The idea is to do a one-pot reaction, i.e. isothermal amplification coupled with the Cas12a detection, with an easy readout, for
                      example USB fluorescence microscope.</P><P class="lead">We believe that easy and thus frequent relapse detection tests could truly help save lives.</P><P class="lead">If you would like to see our experiments in more details, please look at our <A href="2018.igem.org/Team:EPFL/Notebook-Detection-ctDNA"><SPAN style="color:blue">Notebooks</SPAN></A>.</P><DIV class="row justify-content-center lead"><DIV class="col-lg-6"><H2 id="AchievementsctDNA">Achievements</H2><UL><LI>Optimization of Cas12a assay</LI><LI>Finding Cas12a and gRNA incubation conditions</LI><LI>Amplification successfully done in plasma</LI><LI>Successful incorporation of PAM sequence in virtually any sequence</LI><LI>Detection of SNP in plasma</LI><LI>Detection of SNP in plasma with additional background</LI><LI>Detection of translocation in plasma</LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="col-lg-6"><H2>What presented issues</H2><UL><LI>Limiting Cas12a promiscuous activity</LI><LI>Contamination related problems</LI><LI>Amplifying small fragments representing ctDNA</LI></UL></DIV></DIV><ARTICLE><H2><I><U>References</U></I></H2><UL><LI id="Ascierto2012">Ascierto, Paolo A., et al. &quot;The role of BRAF V600 mutation in melanoma.&quot; <I>Journal of translational medicine</I>, 10.1 (2012): 1.</LI><LI id="Gootenberg2018">Gootenberg, Jonathan S., et al. &quot;Multiplexed and portable nucleic acid detection platform with Cas13, Cas12a, and Csm6.&quot; <I>Science</I>, 360.6387 (2018): 439-444.</LI><LI id="deKlein1982">de Klein, Annelies, et al. &quot;A cellular oncogene is translocated to the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myelocytic leukaemia.&quot; <I>Nature</I>, 300.5894 (1982): 765.</LI><LI id="Li2018">Li, Shi-Yuan, et al. &quot;CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted nucleic acid detection.&quot; <I>Cell discovery</I>, 4.1 (2018): 20.</LI></UL></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></MAIN><DIV class="container"><DIV class="align-items-center"><DIV class="text-center"><DIV><SPAN class="pl-3 d-inline-block">iGEM2018@groupes.epfl.ch</SPAN></DIV><SPAN class="d-block mt-4">IGEM EPFL 2018</SPAN><A href="https://twitter.com/EPFL_iGEM" data-fancybox="" class="btn btn-twitter btn-icon-label btn-circle"><SPAN class="btn-inner--text">Twitter</SPAN></A><A href="https://www.facebook.com/igemepfl/?ref=br_rs" data-fancybox="" class="btn btn-facebook btn-icon-label btn-circle"><SPAN class="btn-inner--text">Facebook</SPAN></A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
