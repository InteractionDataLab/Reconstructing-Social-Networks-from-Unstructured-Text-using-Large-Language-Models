During our time in the Giant Jamboree we got extremely useful feedback on our project and how we could improve it, to take it to the next level. Furthermore, the judges solemnly agree in their feedback in the ambition of the project and the thoughtful design of all the parts. For this reason, the judges awarded us with several prices in the over-graduate category, which reflect the work and time invested by the team in making CAPOEIRA a reality:
IGEM Gold Medal Award
The team successfully completed all the Gold medal requirements and for this reason was successfully awarded with the IGEM Gold Medal.
Nomination for Best Therapeutic Project
CAPOEIRA was runner-up in the Therapeutic Category.
Nomination for Best Software
The judges were impressed with the development of Ginga, our bioinformatic pipeline.
