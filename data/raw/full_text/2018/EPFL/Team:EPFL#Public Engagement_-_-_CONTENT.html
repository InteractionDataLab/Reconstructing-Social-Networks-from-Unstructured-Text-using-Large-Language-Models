We believed
                that this was a great opportunity to spread awareness of synthetic biology and biology to an audience in a way that is appealing and less intimidating.

The aim of the exhibition is to celebrate the beauty of science and all the hard work behind it through images, submitted
                by members of the Faculty of Biology and Medicine at UNIL. A selection of photos selected by a multidisciplinary jury and then portrayed in the “La Sonnette” Gallery, in the City Center of Lausanne, opened to the general public. Following
                this discussion inspired, we created a photo contest among 2018 iGEM Team, and photos that we collected during the competition are exposed on our wiki. This meeting also highlighted the importance of visuals for our project presentation,
                shared images, graphics, colors, layout of ideas, legends, etc. It led us to realize the importance of visuals at first sight during a presentation, poster presentation, and we hence payed more attention to these attributes in the designs
                that we created later on for CAPOEIRA. </P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row justify-content-center lead"><DIV class="col-lg-12"><H2>Planète Santé</H2></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row row-grid align-items-center"><DIV class="col-lg-7 ml-lg-auto"><DIV class="pt-lg-lg pl-lg-7"><P class="lead text-gray my-4">Planète Santé (“Healthy Planet” in English) is an annual exhibition event that unites distinguished institutions and the major health stakeholders in the French-speaking part of Switzerland to host a four-day event of experiences, emotion,

This includes an introduction of new people that surrounds the patient
          and plays an integral part in the patient’s life, such as nurses, psychologists and doctors. Therefore the interaction and relationship between the patient and these individuals become very vital during cancer treatment.
        </P><P class="lead"><B>After the Fight:</B> The return of a cancer patient from treatment to normal life may not always be easiest transition, especially because more often that not, there is a lack of support that allows the patient to reintegrate into society,
          and this is an equally important part of cancer treatment that requires research and attention. </P><P class="lead"><B>Patients as a Focus:</B> There should be central focus on the patient among all the disciplines as well as pharmaceutical companies that are working on cancer treatment. It is a human endeavour, and should be approached with humanity, the big
          data that computational oncology requires is data that can only be obtained by interaction with the patient, and will lead to algorithms, robots that will augment the intelligence that aides clinicians and researchers to treat the patients,
          but not replace that humanity.
