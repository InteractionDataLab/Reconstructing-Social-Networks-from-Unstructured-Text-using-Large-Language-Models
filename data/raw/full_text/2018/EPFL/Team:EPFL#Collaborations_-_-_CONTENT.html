We believe in adopting that spirit in our project.
              </P><P class="lead">It was important for us to collaborate with multiple research groups working on synthetic biology and cancer therapeutics during the course of our project. Our interactions with them were vital in the development of our project and we learned
                a lot from their input that allowed us to adapt and improve our project, shaping CAPOEIRA to meet the needs of the relevant stakeholders in the field. We have elaborated our story on our ‘Integrated Human Practices Page
              </P><P class="lead">Equally important to our project was collaboration with other iGEM teams. We were able to team up with teams around the globe on a variety of experiments that contributed to the mutual understanding and improvement of projects, exploring
                the ethical and regulatory landscape of a number of countries regarding synthetic biology as well as giving and receiving feedback where we can on the wiki, project, poster, presentation and other aspects of iGEM projects of our collaborators

Both of our projects rely on Cas12a-fluorophore-based assays in order to create an assay that will allow early detection of HIV

            time, activator concentration, DNAse alert concentration, etc. We had a very insightful discussion about our experiences and shared our knowledge and advice on working with such Cas12a assays. Here are the protocols that we shared with the
            Austin_LASA team, hoping that it would provide useful insights for their Cas12a experiment designs.

                amplification (LAMP) for their project and we took this opportunity to learn about this possibility of isothermal amplification, as well as the implications of performing it successfully. It was a pleasure to exchange ideas with them.

They are using Cas12a in an ingenuitive way to detect proteins through
                  the intermediary of aptamers. Indeed, aptamers have the capacity of recognizing a specific protein and by doing so will release a ssDNA that will be recognized by Cas12a. Since both of our teams are working on a Cas12a detection using
                  fluorophore quencher it was natural for us to give them all the knowledge we had gathered over the summer about our Cas12a assay.

                </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-lg-12"><P class="lead">In addition to their detection method, XMU’s team worked on improving protein’s conservation and were kind enough to share their information on using SAHS proteins as a Cas12a protective agent. It was obvious for us that we could immensely
                benefit from this to bring our follow up cancer surveillance closer to the point-of-care. Unfortunately because of time restrictions we were not able to integrate their assay. This collaboration was nevertheless extremely conducive to
                reflect on how we would get closer to our end product and for this we are very appreciative!

            The collaboration with the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Athens" target="=_blank"><SPAN style="color:blue">Athens IGEM</SPAN></A>team started early in the summer, after members of both teams identified multiple shared attributes between the two projects, namely cell free expression, and diagnostic kit development. Thus, the contact started with
            multiple video conferences over the summer. These conferences discussed iGEM EPFL’s experience with cell free systems optimization, especially with linear DNA expression templates. Moreover, the EPFL team benefited from Athens’ team knowledge
            and experience with kit design to start the kit design for our diagnostic tool. The collaboration finally materialized with Yannis from iGEM Athens visiting the EPFL team and spending some time with us in the lab. The discussion revolved mainly
            on continuing the projects beyond the iGEM competition, and especially the realization of a diagnostics kit. Both teams are planning on developing models for a diagnostic toolkit, as well as models for the 3D printing of their device enclosures.
            The two teams decided on setting a framework for the shared realization of these goals.
