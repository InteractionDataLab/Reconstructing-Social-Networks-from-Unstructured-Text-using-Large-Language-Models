class="lead">With CAPOEIRA the team accomplished to bring one step closer the promise of personalised oncology. However, this work wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the unconditional help and support of many of those wothers. In this page we would like to thank all of these people and acknowledge their contribution in our project.
              </P><H3>Idea Conception</H3><P class="lead">The idea of working on cancer came during the brainstorming sessions, during the project ideation session of the team. We investigated the problems that we could target and we talk to a few professors to understand the clinical needs. We thank Prof. Elisa Oricchio for her input in this part of the project.

              </P><H3>Laboratory Work</H3><LI>All the experiments and assays performed during the project were done by the team members. Due to the immense scope of the project, the lab work was divided into specific subteams each assigned with one part of the project. </LI><LI>Moustafa, Violette, Thomas, Laurine and Theophile, worked in the design, production, purification and expression of the encapsulin-based vaccine. Furthermore, they worked on the design of the biobrick parts submitted to IGEM. </LI><LI>Daniel and Moustafa, worked on the in-vitro dendritic cell assays for uptake and presentation of antigens.
              </LI>Reza, Cindy, Ahmed and Samuel, developed the ctDNA amplification and detection assays for both testing vaccine efficiency and cancer relapse using CRISPR/Cas12a.
          <LI>Marco and Mehdi, were involved in the design of the miRNA amplification and detection assays with CRISPR/cas12a.
              </LI><H3>Software, Wiki and Design</H3><LI>Daniel was responsible for developing the Ginga software to translate whole exome sequencing data into a personalised neoantigen library.
              </LI><LI>Theophile was the main person in charge of designing and arranging the wiki. However, all the team contributed to the content creation and final state of the wiki.
              </LI><LI>Laurine was in charge of designing the team graphic identity, logos and figures for the wiki, poster and presentation, with the help of the rest of the team.
              </LI><H3>Human Practices</H3><P class="lead">Throughout the project all the members of the team had the chance to participate in the human practice modalities. Most interviews were arranged and organized by the team members and attended by a few of the team members according to availability
                and relevance to each of the parts of the project.
              </P><LI>The main contributors to the Human Practice page in the wiki were Laurine, Sam and Daniel. The main contributor to the Entrepreneurship page was Reza.
              </LI><LI>The Symposium of Citizen Sciences Association in Paris and the Ethical Conference in Grenoble was attended by Laurine.
              </LI><LI>Planet Sante Conference and ISREC panel discussion was attended by Laurine and Samuel.
              </LI><LI>The conference Horizons of Cancer Biology and Therapy organised by ISREC was attended by Daniel, Reza and Moustafa.
              </LI><LI>Figure 1.A Art Exhibition organised by Veneta Valeria Gerganova, was attended by major part of the team and the initial collaboration about our planned Synthetic Biology event were done by Laurine and Violette.
              </LI><LI>The 2018 Frontiers Conference at EPFL was attended by all the team members, throughout the different days.
              </LI><LI>The Synthetic Biology symposition at UNIL organised by Alice Berhin was attended by Daniel, Reza and Moustafa.
              </LI><LI>Koniz Summer School Synthetic Biology presentation was organised by Cindy. The workshop using the cell-free kit from 2017 EPFL iGEM team, was instruct by Moustafa, Theophile, Thomas, Violette and GrÃ©goire Michielin.
              </LI><LI>Moustafa, Daniel and Samuel attended the European Meetup in Munich.
              </LI><LI>Thomas represented the team in the Eurasian Meetup hosted in Shenzhen, China.
              </LI><H3>Supervisors</H3><P class="lead"><B>Sebastian Maerkl</B> is the principle instructor of the 2018 EPFL iGEM Team. His main role was to manage the entire project and also give advice in the direction taken by the team. His help was vital to get funding for the project from our two main sponsors: Nikon and SISF. In addition, he is been able to secure EPFL funding over the years for the IGEM team and we hope this will continue in future years. His guidance in wiki design, presentation and overall technical design decisions of the project have been invaluable for the team. Furthermore, Sebastian Maerkl also provided helpful resources and access to his laboratory, Laboratory of Biological Network characterization (LBNC).

              <B>GrÃ©goire Michielin, Michael Crone</B> and <B>Ivan Istomin</B> were our advisors and instructors and probably the people from outside the team that know the project and its intricacy the best. Their feedback in our design experiments and direction of the project subparts has been incredibly helpful. We specially thank GrÃ©goire Michielin for helping us in the design of the cell free expression system and protein purification, Michael Crone for helping us with cloning, plasmid design and the CRISPR/cas12a assay and Ivan Istomin for helping us with the biobrick design and organising our human practices.
