Production of antimicrobial peptides in Escherichia coli for Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius inhibition
Abstract
American and European Foulbrood are diseases that affect bee (Apis mellifera) larvae worldwide. In the last two years, 53 countries suffered from these diseases, 6 of them are among the top 10 honey producers. The causal agents of these ailments are Gram-positive bacteria: Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius respectively. Nowadays, two techniques for the treatment of Foulbrood are used: antibiotics and incineration of hives. The former promotes the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria while the latter results unprofitable for beekeepers. Therefore, we propose the production of bee antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in Escherichia coli to treat P. larvae and M. plutonius infections. Defensin 1, abaecin, defensin 2, and apidaecin are each expressed in a different BL21 (DE3) culture. PelB leader peptide and a 6X His-tag foster adequate expression and further purification. Through mathematical modeling, the diffusivity of PLGA-nanoencapsulated apidaecin is evaluated for future in vivo delivery in the bee system.
Introduction
The most significant agricultural management practice is, without a doubt, pollination. Crops that directly rely on this activity are estimated to have a global price tag of between US$235 and US$577 billion a year. In fact, 87% of the food we consume depends on pollination.1 Apis mellifera ranks as the most frequent species of pollinator for crops worldwide2 making possible and is responsible for the production of strawberry, alfalfa, avocado, coffee, apples, lemons, among many others.3 Bees improve the food production of 2 billion small farmers around the world helping guarantee the food security of the world population.4
Pollination is the greatest strength of bees, but that's not all they do; the world honey market reported historical records during 2015, with volumes of
operation exceeding 2.3 billion dollars. In 2016, Mexico contributed 55,358 tons to the world market, with a value of 2,279 million Mexican pesos.5 Beekeeping in Mexico has great socio-economic importance since it is considered as one of the main livestock activities generating foreign income6, emphasizing that the third part of Mexico’s agricultural production depends on bees.7

Yet in the midst of the highly demanded bee population, beekeepers of multiple continents have suffered severe colony losses in recent years and this issue is ascribed to Colony Collapse Disorder, that corresponds to the 30% annual lost in the number of hives worldwide. The cause of this collapse is unclear, and it is attributed to an infectious synergy of multiple factors including pesticides, nutritional complications due to changes in climate patterns and diseases.9 While viruses and fungal pathogens have been identified as good indicators of this condition, these pathogens, on their own, are not able to explain all losses, suggesting that honey bee colonies are suffering from compromised immune systems which pathogens
are able to take advantage of.8 Two highly contagious diseases that affect bee (Apis mellifera) larvae worldwide demonstrates the magnitude of this problem: American and European Foulbrood. In the last two years, 53 countries suffered from these diseases10 and 6 of them are among the top 10 honey producers.11
Foulbrood presence around the world from 2016 to 2018.10
American Foulbrood
American foulbrood (AFB) is the most virulent bacterial disease of honey bee brood worldwide.12 An infected hive will suffer a significant loss of larvae and without the new breed, to replace the older workers, the entire colony is in danger, in addition, the spores of the causal agent, Paenibacillus larvae, can remain active for more than 30 years.13
The spread starts when larvae ingest food contaminated by the spores of the pathogen. The spores reach the lumen in the midgut where they germinate, transform to its vegetative form and multiply before beginning the attack the epithelium; the secondary metabolites (black and white hexagons in the image) produced by P. larvae help to overcome the microbial competitors and to conquer the midgut, then P. larvae secrete an enzyme (red stars in the image) that degrades chitin in order to digest the peritrophic matrix (pink structure that has

the objective of protecting the midgut epithelium (gray cells with blue nuclei) against pathogens. This step marks the transition from the non-invasive phase to the invasive phase of the infection. Finally, the bacteria attack the epithelial cells and manage to reach the hemolymph, here the destructive phase starts, and larvae die by septicemia. During this last phase, the nutrients are scarce, and the bacteria begin to sporulate to form a mass of spores that are latter scattered by the adult bees inside and outside. the colonies.14
European Foulbrood
As it is very difficult to eradicate, European foulbrood (EFB) maintains the colonies weak and vulnerable for many years instead of showing a sudden high mortality rate. Melissococcus plutonius, the bacteria responsible for this ailment, can remain in the body of those larvae that survived the disease during its pupal stage and reached the adult stage or can infect the bees responsible for cleaning the cells when larvae die. The adult bees expel the bacteria through the feces or from the food they provide to the larvae; M. plutonius enters the larva until it reaches the midgut where it reproduces exponentially. Later, the pathogen is situated at the interface of the peritrophic membrane and competes for nutrients causing larval death by starvation.15
Nowadays, there are two deficient treatment methods used worldwide against these two Gram-positive bacteria. First, antibiotics like oxytetracycline and chloramphenicol lead bacteria to mutate, making them resistant and harder to fight. In addition, innocuousness is a determining factor for the acceptance of honey in importing countries;16 it is necessary to comply with the zero-tolerance policy for antibiotics that limits waste to 1 part per billion exercised by the European Union, the United States and now, by markets that previously were more tolerant in terms of waste.17 More drastically, beekeepers can incinerate everything in the hive. Despite it being the most effective way to end with the

infection, it has many negative implications: it abruptly disposes of years-worth of beekeeper investment, requires extensive authorization processes, and brings a stressful halt to the bees’ lives.
Detailed Project Description
Honey bee immune responses are composed of a complex suite of individual immune mechanisms that divide in three levels of resistance: physical barriers as the first line of defense, cell-mediated immunity, and cell-free humoral immunity. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are recognized as key components of humoral immunity and their two basic mechanisms of action are: generation of leaks into prokaryotic membranes and inhibition of bacterial protein translation or folding.18
Only young larvae are susceptible to AFB and regarding EFB, any larval stage results in vulnerability, but the older the larva is the less it is affected by the infection.15 In AFB, the hemocoel of challenged larvae is flooded with an extremely high dose of P. larvae that might demand too much from the humoral and cellular immune system at least from very young larvae. The susceptibility of larvae is attributed to the age-dependent development and composition of the peritrophic matrix that represents a barrier for P. larvae to reach the
gut epithelium and the fat body being the major tissue for the synthesis of antimicrobial compounds results too small in first instar larvae to produce enough amounts of AMPs to defend against P. larvae and M. plutonius.19
Our project objective is to produce AMPs in E. coli (BL21) and then provide larvae the sufficient amount of these key humoral immunity components for it to defend against P. larvae and M. plutonius. AMPs display antimicrobial activity at lower concentrations than conventional antibiotics, bacterial resistance is less likely to develop and they have a broad antimicrobial activity.23 Four AMPs, previously reported to be effective at inhibiting these bacteria, are considered: apidaecin, abaecin, defensin 1 and defensin 2.

Once the AMP’s are inside the larvae system they complete the overall objective of the project, inhibiting both pathogenic bacteria, and they use different mechanisms of action to do it.
Apidaecin
Defensin 1 & 2
Abaecin
Apidaecin
Apidaecin is mostly lethal to Gram-negative bacteria, nevertheless, in the previous investigation by Khilnani, J. in 201523 apidaecin by itself showed antimicrobial activity against P. larvae and worked in synergy with defensin 2 effectively inhibiting this pathogen. Apidaecin appears to have no effect toward eukaryotic cells, and there is little to no bacterial resistance. The mechanism by which apidaecin kills bacteria starts with a non-specific binding of the peptide to an outer membrane component, which is a substantial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component. Apidaecin later invades the periplasmic space thanks to a specific receptor/docking molecule, which is a component of the transport system on the inner membrane. The peptide is then translocated into the interior of the cell.24 It is transported through into the cytosol by SbmA.25 Once the peptide is inside of the cell it has two possible targets: DnaK and the 70s ribosome. Apidaecin leads the protein synthesis inhibition by targeting the ribosome. However, it appears that the ultimate target is the DnaK, this is the major bacterial Hsp70 (70 kDa heat shock proteins). DnaK has several functions that end up inhibited by the peptide; the ATPase activity, which is involved in the initiation of DNA synthesis, and the refolding of misfolded proteins.24 DnaK is also indispensable for the viability of the cell in stress conditions like heat shock at 42ºC.26
Defensin 1 & 2
Defensins have selective activity against Gram-positive bacteria. They disrupt, by forming channels, the permeability barrier of the cytoplasmic membrane, resulting in a loss of cytoplasmic K+, a partial depolarization of the inner membrane, a decrease in cytoplasmic ATP, and inhibition of respiration processes.27
Abaecin
Abaecin shows activity against both Gram-negative and positive bacteria28. It inhibits protein biosynthesis by targeting 70s ribosomes and also inhibits DnaK29. Abaecin requires a compromised cell envelope or the presence of a pore-forming peptide such as hymenoptaecin or defensin before it can penetrate the membrane and gain access to its intracellular targets.30
