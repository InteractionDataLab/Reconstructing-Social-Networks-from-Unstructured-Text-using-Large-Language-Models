However, we have noticed that various diseases attack the bees in the different stages of their life, which leads to significant economic losses per year in each country since most of these diseases are not treated correctly. We attempt to breach barriers between the beekeeping industry and synthetic biology through a product that meets the needs of beekeepers, it is not harmful to the environment and is available for everyone.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">In Mexico, there are no specific products to combat American and European foulbrood; the current treatment methods are severe and not completely effective such as the use of antibiotics which remain in the products derived from bees. The losses of bees due to diseases affect the beekeeping industry directly. Our product arises as an alternative to the current methods for treating this two diseases offering an effective, safe and responsible product that strengthens the immune system of bees.</P></DIV><H3 align="center">4 Steps to Effective Customer Problem Solving</H3><DIV id="C" class="tabcontent"><H3>Client</H3><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">
Our client is the beekeeper that focuses in the caregiving and massive production of hives, for the national and international sale of products such as honey and its derivatives. These are of high importance for the Mexican economy, not only for the export of honey products but also because of the link between pollinating bees and the agriculture of the country. However, this industry does not receive the attention it deserves, because there are many illnesses that attack them and very few companies that dedicate themselves to prevent or treat them, or even to the development of research about it and how these illnesses affect the world’s economy. </P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The methods currently used to treat infected hives are antibiotics not specialized in diseases and the hive burning. The method by antibiotics is very controversial since the residues of antibiotics can infiltrate in the final products marketed like honey and propolis. As a consequence, the use of antibiotics has been banned in several countries because of the long-term effects that this could have on the health of consumers.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The current universally accepted method is the destruction and burning of the hive, however, the process ends in multimillion-dollar losses to the beekeeping community.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="P" class="tabcontent"><H3>Problem</H3><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The American Foulbrood is an illness caused by a pathogenic bacterium called Paenibacillus larvae, which can be found globally and infects the hives. A single colony of the hive with the infection unrestrained will suffer a significative loss of larvae. Without the new litter to replace the elder workers, the entire colony will be in danger and will probably die. However, some colonies are strong enough to recover from the loss. Besides, there are some colonies, like the colonies of South America or the Africanized bees that can resist the infection of the pathogen. This phenomenon has the characteristic that this colonies usually produce a bigger amount of propolis when compared to the honey bees of Europe.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The European Foulbrood is an illness caused by the pathogenic bacterium, Gram-positive, called Melissococcus plutonius that affects the bee larvae. The genetic resistance of some bee species to the illness allows them to overcome the infections without suffering severe damages. However, it must be mentioned that it generally has a better forecast than the American Foulbrood, in some zones, the European Foulbrood has an even more malignant manifestation, damaging severely even the strong colonies of bees.<SUP>1</SUP></P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">EFB affects mainly the unsealed babies, which can kill the larvae generally when they are 4 to 5 days old. The infected larvae move around the breeding cell, and instead of the regular rolled position, the larvae die displaced in their cell, twisted around the walls or stretched out. The color of the larvae changes from white to yellow, then brown and finally, when they decompose, black.  If a big portion of the larvae dies, the patron of raising seems irregular and sometimes sends an unpleasant or sour smell.<SUP>2</SUP></P></DIV><H4 align="justify">References</H4><OL><LI>Formato G., Menegotto A., &amp; Jannoni-Sebastianini R.

The months we worked on this project, we had the opportunity to establish contact with different beekeepers and beekeeping societies. We began in the places nearest to our city and expanded to the rest of the country (and the world). Thanks to this we could comprehend their necessities and adapt to these, so our services can be the most comfortable and efficient.
</P><P align="justify">
On several occasions, we had the pleasure of talking with the beekeeping association of Cuauhtemoc City, Chihuahua, where we showed them our proposal and received feedback about the characteristics that they search for in a product: efficacy, simplicity in application, good prices, and infrequent application. In the beginning, we wanted to apply the solution as purified peptides either as a liquid or dusted over hives. Nonetheless, when it is dispersed on a hive’s box, it is threatened by foragers, wind or other insects. We decided that the best option was for the product to be added to the bee’s feeders.
</P><P align="justify">
During our stance in Delicias, to the IV State Beekeeping Forum, we had the chance to assist to several apiaries, where we approached bees and discovered the real impact of our product. Seeing the working conditions of beekeepers helped us identify the need for an efficient and functional product; any inconvenience in its application would results in hours lost, because of the number of hives kept. In this same way, we established contact with companies that deliver beekeeping products with which we could have a future partnership for national distribution. Beekeepers mentioned in this Forum that they’d like to see our finished project or research in the future.
</P><P align="justify">
From Valencia, Spain, we had contact with several beekeepers that commented, based on experience, how these diseases are treated. They told us antibiotics are distributed in the food but it contaminates pollen and makes it inadequate for human consumption, which creates economic losses for apiculture. This is why we decided to use only honeybee-native AMPs, to avoid exportation problems.
</P><P align="justify">
Likewise, we were given the opportunity to talk to the Italian Federation of Apiculture, who gave us their unconditional support for the validation of our project, to promote the precise development of our product; we were also assured that they could back commercialization across Italy.
</P><P align="justify">
Finally, Chile’s association brought us full support and mentioned they’d be willing to put our product in the Chilean market. Their disposition comes from their interest in fighting these diseases, which invigorated us to keep working on the project.

After this, he collaborated with us, providing us with his extensive knowledge in the area to solve questions from the different teams, all of them focused on his expertise area in order to make the most of his support. In addition to helping us in that way, he was in charge of creating contact between us and other experts in business development so that they would support us, like him, with the questions that the teams asked us.

His experience was very useful for the development of our product.
He, like the MVZ that Ernesto Tanus had mentioned to us, said that if we are going to start a business, we should follow a legislature and we should evaluate the risks that our product involves. We decided to add to our legal section some things that cover those points, to complement our legal plan and add these points to the business plan
Also, he was in charge of asking us some important questions, with the purpose that we as a company contemplated if it was feasible, economically speaking, that our product was created and launched to the market, since it made us compare the expenditure of investment in the peptides and the approximate final price of our product.</P><H4 align="Justify">Mr. Manuel Ramírez Salcido</H4><P align="justify">The salient engineer shared with us his concern about the fact that the government offers very little attention to the apicultural sector, so we came up with the idea that, when our product can be released to the market, to make an agreement with the government, in which This will support us as a Mexican company and beekeepers by creating a program of support for prevention and cure of American foulbrood and European foulbrood, which would consist in the government supporting us economically to develop our company, and thus be able to become international , and in return we would compensate you by granting a certain percentage of our production, so that they can provide free support to beekeepers who suffer from this disease in their hives.</P><H4 align="Justify">Ph.D. Maria Mercedes Roca</H4><P align="justify">During our video call with Dr. Roca, she mentioned that when we decided to start with our company it would be good if we generated an agreement with a pharmaceutical company that would have the infrastructure to perform the nanoencapsulation, so that we would not have to buy the machinery that is required to carry out this process, we analyze your proposal and for that reason we decided that instead of buying this infrastructure from us, it was a better option to rent it to a company that already did this process, and thus benefit both parties.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="bfive" class="tabcontent1"><H3 align="center">Business Plan</H3></DIV><DIV id="bsix" class="tabcontent1"><H3 align="center">Company's Projection</H3></DIV><H3 align="center">Innovation Week</H3><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">This was an event held by the Chihuahua Innova program, which is developed by elements of the State of Chihuahua on May 21<SUP>th</SUP> and 22<SUP>th</SUP>, 2018.
