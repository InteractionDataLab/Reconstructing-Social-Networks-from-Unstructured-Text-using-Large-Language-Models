A project with the essence of ours would not be possible without the validation and feedback of expert researchers, beekeepers, and governmental organizations. The problem against which we are fighting has a global presence and for us, it was indispensable to listen also affected persons of outside our country. Making us stronger in the entrepreneurship part was also essential; the selling of a product of this nature implicates different marketing strategies and taking courses about this was crucial for the development of the business model.
We believe that for synthetic biology projects to catch the attention of the community and be considered, it is necessary for people to get informed, get involved and participate. We made different Public Engagement activities for pursuing this objective, covering from our principal concern, beekeepers, up to students from middle school till college. As mentioned before our local community is just a tiny part of the society so we got involved in national and international events.
The the project evolved got better and fitted in thanks to all the different events mentioned in this timeline. We present here a general overview of what we did in each event; when entering each section at the end of the page we detail how each experience molded our project.
Human Practices Timeline
High School Introductory Topics
Our very first public engagement activity, next generations are the key for synthetic biology development!
We shared with the next generation of biotechnologists of our institution, approximately 32 students, what iGEM was and what synthetic biology was.
March 2nd
April 28th
Meeting with Guillermo Rodríguez, president of the Cuauhtemoc city beekeepers’ association
This was our first direct approach with the beekeepers community! We discussed aspects like:
Current status of Foulbrood in Cuauhtémoc.
Existing methods to treat Foulbrood.
SAGARPA’s restrictions regarding products applied in the hive.
General characteristics of Apis mellifera’s life
Invitation to join the association in the next monthly beekeepers’ reunion in Cuauhtémoc.
Monthly beekeepers’ association reunion in Cuauhtémoc
Around 30 beekeepers ready to share with us their feedback and insights.
Presentation of our project.
Discussion of implications of the product like best application methods.
May 5th
May 21st
Innovation Week
We attended this state convention where figures regarding entrepreneurship talked about different topics like:
How to start a business and how to manage the business model; according to young and succesful entrepreneurs.
IMPI (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial); How to create a patent?
How to adequately manage the incomes of an enterprise.
Meeting with Ing. Manuel Ramírez Salcido, a beekeeper from Delicias city
Discussion of aspects like:
Importance of pollination.
Restrictions implicated in European Union’s honey importation.
Innocuousness of the honey.
Different methods applied in hives to fight diseases.
May 26th
June 7th
Videoconference with MVZ Ernesto Tanús Sánchez
Discussion of aspects like:
History of Foulbrood in our country.
Recommendations for the application method of our product.
Hygienic behavior; bees have different mechanisms to clean themselves and the hive.
Importance of the consideration of bee anatomy in our project.
CIAD visit (Centro de Investigación en Alimentación y Desarrollo A.C.) and direct interaction with bees
In CIAD they have worked in investigations with Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius; they gave us advice on how to manage the in vitro growth.
Restrictions implicated in European Union’s honey importation.
We had the opportunity to interact with beehives, get to know how beekeepers work with them and how they feed them.
We discussed the bioethical aspect of working with bees in the laboratory.
June 15th
June 15th
Meeting with Ing. Alejandro Bianchi in Queretaro city
Discussion of aspects like:
Different treatments against bee diseases and their application methods.
Relevance and necessity of the increase of bee defenses
Training Day
This Training Day helped us discover the 5 key steps to develop a business in the biotech area.
June 15th
June 27th
Meeting with MVZ Ernesto Tanús Sánchez, Delegado Estatal de SAGARPA Chihuahua, Jose Luis
In this reunion we had the opportunity to present our project plus getting counseling about some parts of the bee anatomy. We could also discuss some aspects like:
Difficulties and impediments regarding governmental legislations related to bees.
How to ensure the peptides have arrived at the larva?
Valencia validation questionnaire
Thanks to our colleagues from Valencia_UPV, we received written feedback from a Valencian beekeeper and information about the current status of foulbrood in his province.
July 16th

Science Clubs Mexico 2018
Presentation of our project.
We joined forces with the club “The world of biotechnology”, conformed by approximately 20 students. Our team donated needed materials to follow protocols of genetic engineering and we acted as assistants. We also talked with students about our project, iGEM competition and synthetic biology.
