After the video call we had with Ernesto Tanús, we were able to keep in contact with him, since he was visiting the city of Chihuahua we took advantage of the opportunity and we scheduled a meeting that was also attended by the President of the National Association of Veterinary Doctors Specialists in Bees (ANMVEA) (MVZ Adolfo Arroyo) and a beekeeping technician from the Secretary of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fishing and Food (SAGARPA) (Ing.

The legal framework consultant accompanied by two active members of</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><P align="justify">human practices attended this meeting that lasted approximately 1h 30. We were looking forward to presenting our project, for them to the give us their general insights, discuss the considerations of legal aspects that involve our project, and receive counseling of the bee's anatomy.</P><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">For this date, we were in search of precise statistics on the presence of foulbrood around the world. Mr. Tanús recommended us to consult the OIE (International Office of Epizootics) where the countries report the presence of different diseases. After this meeting, we were able to consult and obtain specific data of each country to better track Fouldbrood distribution (<A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tec-Chihuahua/Public_Engagement">Consult the distribution map in the detailed project description</A>). The specialists also shared with us that the last time AFB was diagnosed in Mexico, was in 2015 and that the infected apiary was eliminated.

After arduous research and incorporation of the received advice in this meeting, we were able to know in detail the anatomy of the bee and integrate the important factor of it to our project design. (<A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tec-Chihuahua/Bees">Consult details about the bee anatomy</A>). When we were discussing the terms of the anatomy of the bee we both realized that some terms had different words but referred to the same part. We also had the opportunity to become aware that some very specific parts of the bee could influence the nanocapsule path that we were analyzing.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Regarding the technical part of the project, the attendees to the meeting recommended us that at the time of the experimentation part with bees, some innocuous dye could be added to make sure that the nanocapsules were reaching the larva. In addition, it was discussed how there is greater production of larvae during flowering, and in this time artificial feeding is not widely used; thus we concluded how our product would be optimal to be used before the period of flowering, so at the initiation of the greater production of larvae, if the bacteria, which mainly infects in the first days of the bee larva, attacks, the antimicrobial peptide will already be found in the medium to reach the objective.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">We also had the opportunity to know a little about the perspectives and concerns of the three persons in the meeting. They perceive the problem that the regulations regarding the handling of bees and their products are not enough for reaching a strong and growing beekeeping sector, and although they have tried to promote the implementation of a NOM (Official Mexican Norm), they have seen little possibility and many impediments. They also shared with us their concern about how there exists a barrier between researchers and producers; the needs and advances sometimes do not go hand in hand and there is no adequate implementation and development.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-3"><P align="center">Device where queen bees are transported</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-9"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">We had the privilege to share all this important talk with queen bees and worker bees!

As we have previously received different recommendations to speak with SENASICA’s (National Service of Sanitation, Innocuousness, and Agri-food Quality) chief department, we took advantage of this great opportunity and indeed contacted MVZ Juan Diego Pérez de la Rosa to present him our project and discuss new insights and considerations. He is a bee specialist, but also owns a great panorama about legal implications in the agri-food sector! The meeting took place by a video call and the legal framework consultant conducted this reunion that lasted approximately 35 minutes.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">First, in the meeting, we presented our project and the scope that synthetic biology can have in the beekeeping area. Regarding the theme of foulbrood distribution, the MVZ Juan Diego Perez de la Rosa commented us that in Chihuahua two cases of American foulbrood had been registered last year. By this time in the development of our project, we had found many ambiguities with the data of presence of foulbrood in Mexico, and we were able to conclude that many times beekeepers do not report that they own infected hives because they look forward to saving money and preserving the stability of their business.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">As the reunion flowed, we were also able to discuss some technical factors of our project. Sr. Juan Diego told us that AMPs were perfect for what we wanted and for keeping the innocuousness of honey. We also consulted with him a question that had been asked to us previously: When it comes to increasing the concentration of AMP’s, is it possible that a negative overaccumulation results in the bee? The MVZ analyzed and suggested that bees are exposed to many pathogens, with our product they could become more resistant; the treatment was perceived by him like a supplement that will help bees defend themselves. With so many pathogens attacking bees, we can hardly create an adverse problem, instead would fortify hives in hard times.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The MVZ was very interested in the alternative we propose and said we could consider later on, the possibility of nanoencapsulating our peptides with his help. “The approach is excellent and it is a work of great quality.” He was astonished when we talked about the physiology of the bee regarding our project and he kindly also mentored us on how we should use fewer technicalities when we attended the IV State’s Beekeeping Forum, as it was approaching.</P></DIV><P align="center"><I>“Bees are warriors!

In some countries, genetically altered agricultural products have been sold without much debate, while in others, there have been vocal protests against their use, particularly when they are sold without being identified as genetically modified. In response to these concerns, during the past two decades, two Protocols have been adopted by the Parties to the CBD. In January 2000, the Parties approved the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. This Protocol seeks to ensure the safe handling, transport, and use of living modified organisms (LMOs) resulting from biotechnology. To that end, the Protocol establishes procedures that allow countries to make informed decisions before agreeing to the import of LMOs into their territories.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">More recently, the Parties adopted the Nagoya Protocol. It reaffirms each nation’s sovereignty over its genetic resources and calls for the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic materials. By ensuring benefit-sharing, the Protocol seeks to create incentives to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity. The Nagoya Protocol entered into force on October 14<SUP>th</SUP> 2014.<SUP>3</SUP></P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">One of the issues discussed in the Nagoya Protocol is the genome of a particular species may now be sequenced within a provider country and that information may be transferred digitally to a company or research entity for downloading to a DNA synthesizer.<SUP>2</SUP> Another significant issue discussed in the COP is if synthetic biology is different enough from modern biotechnology that it must require a different protocol and a different risk assessment, the GMOs of modern biotechnology.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The Parties to the CBD considered regulation of synthetic biology during their 12th COP meeting in October 2014. There, they agreed to take a precautionary approach to the release of any LMOs resulting from synthetic biology under the Cartagena Protocol. At the same time, the Parties called for the formation of an Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group on Synthetic Biology (AHTEG) to evaluate, among other things, whether existing arrangements constituted a comprehensive regulatory framework for addressing potential impacts from synthetic biology technologies.<SUP>3</SUP></P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Article 15 of the Cartagena Protocol establishes that to do genetic engineering to develop or liberate a GMO, a risk assessment must be done first. The AHTEG was created to develop a risk assessment guide which was created about 8 years ago. Members from different countries that assisted to the COPs were invited to participate in this group and a risk assessment guide was started within the Cartagena protocol.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Dr. María Mercedes Roca is a professor of Biotechnology, formerly at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Guadalajara campus in Mexico.

Dr. Mercedes is part of a group of Latin Americans unsatisfied with the rigorous risk assessment guide the AHTEG developed. Aware that in Latin America a risk assessment is needed and by taking into account the principles of biosafety in a very responsible way, this group made a guide under international confinements of risk assessment that people can follow and that countries can address, the guide is named Genetically Modified Organisms Environmental Risk Assessment Guide.</P></DIV><P align="center">&quot;There is a whole area of science called risk analysis; we made a guide that falls within the international parameters to assess risks internationally.&quot;</P><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The guide her team has developed is a guide they expect servers biotechnology students like us, making it able for them to start a business or sell a product.

Mr. Rodríguez is the president of the association of beekeepers in the city and we saw an enormous opportunity in talking to him. This was our very first direct approach with the beekeeper’s community! We were very excited to start getting to know them. What would they think about our ideas? Would they be interested in our project? How many things would they have to tell us? Our project was about to begin its transformation path.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">This enriching talk lasted approximately 1 hour 15 minutes and different topics were discussed. We learned many general characteristics of bees' lives thanks to the great experience of the beekeeper: The different varieties of bees that exist, specific tasks of each type of bee and the joint work bees and beekeepers do to ensure pollination.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Regarding the existing methods against Foulbrood, Mr. Rodríguez mentioned how SAGARPA (National Secretary of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fishing, and Food) does not allow the usage of chemical contaminants in beehives because wastes may end up in honey flows. Mr. Rodríguez mentioned how beekeepers sometimes use extracts of rosemary or oregano against Foulbrood, but it is always difficult for them to know what dose to add and ensure it is adequate for fighting the diseases and at the same time does not destabilize the hive. On another hand, he mentioned that the method of burning beehives results very expensive for them. Currently, in Cuauhtémoc, there is almost no presence of American Foulbrood, since, in the past, many sick hives were exposed to this burning method, then the disease decreased. On the other hand, European foulbrood is most commonly found in Cuauhtemoc.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The beekeeper emphasized how a natural product against Foulbrood is needed, so there are not left residues in the honey and he also highlighted how beekeeping varies around the world and sometimes there are specific necessities for each region.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Thanks to the sharing we made with the beekeeper of our project, he was able to have a new panorama of beekeeping, and how emerging technologies, in this case, synthetic biology, can accurately respond to specific problematics and can relegate past methods that imply many setbacks.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Mr. Rodríguez kindly invited us to present our project with the Cuauhtémoc beekeepers association and commented us about M.C.

Since we arrived with Mr. Ramírez, it was amazing how the discussion flowed and flowed, getting a meeting that end-up lasting approximately 3 hours; all were valuable minutes that taught us many relevant aspects for the development of our project.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">First, Mr. Ramírez covered the topic of the importance of bees, emphasizing how they have always been considered an essential factor for environmental health and he even showed us a funny cucumber that had not been correctly pollinated; it was very small and thin.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Bee   diseases   were   our   next   topic.  He  commented  how Foulbrood</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><P align="justify">presence isn’t that strong in Mexico, however, in Europe and in the USA, this is not the case. Mr. Ramírez took advantage and included implications of other frequent bee diseases like Nosema and Varroa in the conversation. He mentioned a very important point that we had previously started to notice: Most of the serious problems in bees caused by viruses or bacteria, are not correctly detected or even known. As Mr. Rodríguez had previously commented, Mr. Ramírez mentioned how different extracts of plants are used against diseases in bees, in this case, mint and grapefruit were the examples. On another hand it was mentioned how antibiotics are not an option at all for treatment, since the European Union does not accept them, neither does accept the presence of transgenics in the honey; there are rigorous studies exercised and if there is something wrong the EU may return an entire shipment of honey back to the remitter. We discussed the issue of innocuity of honey by highlighting that when there is a new product added to the hive, it should not generate any residue at all or change the expected properties from the consumer.</P><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">After talking about our project, a question arose in Mr. Ramírez, an issue that would be asked many times since that day and that we would do everything possible to solve and validate: Our product would actually pass from the food that the nurse bee ingest all through its system until reaching the larva by means of the royal jelly? And regarding the method of application, (initially consisting in applying the final product in the bee bread), Mr. Ramírez explained to us how this bee bread is created, and the fermentation process it goes through in the bee cell.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">We also had the great opportunity of listening to some of the concerns Mr. Ramírez has as a beekeeper: He thinks the beekeeping area could be greatly impulsed by receiving more support from governmental institutions and he perceives that the validation of honey innocuousness here in Mexico results complicated as there are not enough tools to endorse the required diagnostics. On another hand, he mentioned how there are no young people able to continue with the job of the current farmers, and this is an alarming situation that requires a prompt resolution.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Mr. Ramírez gave us a lot of priceless information that was essential for the development of our whole project. He was the first to comment us about the beekeeping congress that would take place in the city of Delicias in the coming months, and which we would have the great  privilege to attend, he told us that by means of the different sites where he frequently researches information he had noticed another iGEM team that was working with bees, for the month of September we could establish a collaboration with this team (<A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tec-Chihuahua/Collaborations">consult collaborations for more information</A>) and on this same point of the media, Mr. Ramírez explained to us how he always tried to receive literature to focus and inform himself, he mentioned the magazine “Bee Culture”, where we successfully managed to make a publication about our project and synthetic biology regarding beekeeping (<A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tec-Chihuahua/Public_Engagement">consult public engagement for more information</A>).</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-7"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">He also shared with us the contacts of highly recommended specialists with whom we could consult about our product and with which we would have contact later: Juan Diego Pérez de la Rosa, Efraín Rocha, Felipe Esquivel Díaz.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">We were able to share a new perspective on beekeeping in relation to synthetic biology with Mr. Ramírez by explaining him our project, the beekeeper mentioned how he was more than willing to help us, and he even shared some honey and bee bread with us!

The Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (Spanish: SAGARPA) is the governmental institution responsible of inspecting their hives, it allows under certain requirements the use of antibiotics for treating foulbrood but has to avoid products that pollute the environment and honey. He also shared with us the treatment he uses to fight Varroa which consists in an essential oils mix and stressed it is important not to use the same treatment for a long time since the pathogen can develop a resistance towards it.</P><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">We asked him if he could share with us certain regulations or standards that had to be followed to ensure the honey’s quality,  he mentioned the &quot;Good livestock practices&quot;.Discussing other issues affecting beekeeping in his state, another serious problem in Queretaro is bee theft, as beekeepers visit their bees every 8 or 15 days, they are the target for many people that take advantage of this situation. Engineer Bianchi assists to the Beekeeper's society meetings, and he sees there are not young beekeepers to take the hard work of beekeeping, he sees that as another issue.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Finally, after approximately an hour of conversating, he shared us his book of memories from the 25th International Apicultural Update Congress which was held in Queretaro last year and invited us to visit his beehives as well as the facilities of his company.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="Bees4" class="tabcontent1"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><H4 align="justify">July 16<SUP>th</SUP>Valencian beekeeper interview</H4><OL class="o"><LI>Received information on aspects like:</LI><OL class="o"><LI>Status of foulbrood in Valencia.</LI><LI>Treatment used against foulbrood in Valencia.</LI><LI>Beekeeper's opinion about our solution proposal.</LI></OL></OL></DIV></DIV><H3 align="center">Detailed Description</H3><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Thanks to our colleagues from Valencia_UPV, we received written feedback from a Valencian beekeeper and information about the current status of foulbrood in his province.

In Valencia the treatment against foulbrood consist in the following:</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">First, the combs with the infected brood are replaced by healthy brood and then antibiotic with powdered sugar, is applied. The adult bees, when they realize the larvae are dead, clean the cell. The beekeeper ensures that with this treatment he has managed to heal all his hives, and has not suffered any loss from the disease, the drawback for this method is that it contaminates pollen, so it would no longer be suitable for human consumption, and when this treatment is not applied on time, beekeepers get to have very large losses of money and even the total loss of their hives (between 20 to 100 hives per beekeeper). Regarding this information, we could realize that antibiotics indeed are currently used and although they are effective in treating the disease, the innocuity of the honey is always altered resulting in market issues.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Once the beekeeper heard about our project and learned about biotechnological alternatives that seek to solve beekeeping problems, he considered it an adequate proposal which does not contaminate the bee products and he was expectant before the results of the project to evaluate if it is actually an effective method.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="Bees5" class="tabcontent1"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><H4 align="justify">September 22<SUP>nd</SUP>Videocall with Bryan Saavedra</H4><OL class="o"><LI>Discussion of aspects like:</LI><OL class="o"><LI>Presence of bee diseases in Chile and its implications.</LI><LI>Agricultural and Livestock Service normative.</LI><LI>Can our product help against varroa?</LI><LI>How bee’s longevity varies depending on different production stages.</LI></OL></OL></DIV></DIV><H3 align="center">Detailed Description</H3><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Keeping on with our international validation on the presence of foulbrood, its implications, and our project insights, we were able to contact a Chilean beekeeper thanks to our colleagues from UChile (LINK collaborations).

During the meeting, that lasted approximately 35 minutes, we were able to discuss the presence of bee diseases in Chile, its implications and some activities of Chilean agencies in charge of supporting the development of agriculture, forests, and livestock.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Foulbrood occur in Chile as foci of infection,  once  an  infection  is  detected,  which  most  likely  originated</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><P align="justify">from contaminated equipment, the SAG (Agricultural and Livestock Service) proceeds to burn and then bury the infected hives; the decision of burning the beehives is quite drastic but it is the only effective way to take care of the rest of the Chilean apiculture. The last outbreak of foulbrood the beekeeper noticed about, was in last February; normally the infection comes from Argentina, which is where the disease most often occurs. In Chile, they mostly struggle with varroa and nosema and for purposes of the SAG and exportations, the varroa mite is treated with organic products, that result inefficient and expensive. Antibiotics are also used against Varroa, getting back to the resistance problem. Regarding this topic, the beekeeper wondered if our product would help against varroa, and we could tell him how one of the most important consequences of varroa is that the immune system is weakened; providing the bee with new immunity components (AMP’s) will greatly help it, so the answer is yes! Our product can help bees get fortified when they are suffering from varroa.</P><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The beekeeper also shared with us the main routes through which the disease is transmitted from Argentina to Chile, how the bee's life duration varies depending on the production stage and also shared with us details about SAC normative.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Regarding the discussed topic on how bee’s longevity varies depending on different production stages, we explained the beekeeper another approach of our project: When the bee uses less energy in the production of antimicrobial peptides it is possible that its longevity increases.<SUP>2</SUP></P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Bryan Saavedra did not know about synthetic biology and we gave him an approach to this area and how it had so many reaches, one of them being beekeeping.

We were looking to enrich our investigation with the point of view of a veterinary expert. Dr. Tanus provided us with an hour and a half of his time to listen to our work. He began by introducing the arrival of foulbrood in Mexico and mentioning the National Program for Honey Harmlessness and Quality, which appeals to European standards (since the EU is Mexican honey’s largest purchaser). Among these standards, Mexico asks honey producers to create antibiotic-free products.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">On American Foulbrood, he called the larvae’s first 24 hours “crucial”, since it is the time their defenses are at their lowest. He remarked that there aren´t effective remedies to these diseases, only preventive methods.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">He said that bee colony arson was frowned upon and claimed that <A href="#1">wood should not be used indiscriminately</A>. When one suspects spores are present, it is imperative to change hives and flame the boxes by blowtorch, this is sterilization.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">On our own account, we found NOM--SEMARNAT/SAGARPA-2007 which sets parameters under which it is legal to start fires on forestry, agricultural, and cattle land. It allows fires for the control of bacterial diseases, after meeting several requirements.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">He mentioned foulbrood incidence has declined since 2008 thanks to the Good Honey Production Practices manual which recommends changing boxes and preventive strategies for beekeepers. He mentioned MSc Juan Diego Perez de la Rosa, Head of the Department of Genomic Sequencing at the National Center for Animal Health Verification Services, who has cultured <I>Paenibacillus larvae</I> for identification, from samples taken in 17 different states of the Mexican Republic.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Tanus stated that it is impossible to say that there is no presence of foulbrood in Mexico without first conducting an epizootiology study in the country. He clarified that the word of a beekeeper is not in doubt; however, it might be hard to obtain real data as it is a mandatory complaint issue, so there is distrust of the producer. He shared some characteristics that differentiate both foulbrood. He also commented on the incidence of these diseases throughout the seasons.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Dr. Tanus suggested liquid application (in the form of syrup) which beekeepers could feed their hives. This syrup (sweetened water) could contain the peptides in it and be fed directly to the box. This way, nurse bees would feed on here. Since Africanized bees appeared, he claims, it is better to have interior feeding to avoid foragers. This method would also avoid product loss from environmental conditions such as the wind or sun.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">He reassured us that peptides would get to the brood, regardless of the application and only the time it takes might change. Peptides cannot arrive directly since larvae do not feed on their own: on their first 3 days, larvae are fed jelly, and with bee bread the following three. He also gave us a first draft of the path the peptides follow: from the digestive system to the hemolymph and finally to the hypopharyngeal glands in the head where they produce royal jelly.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Adult bees are not affected by P. larvae. In fact, in their digestive system, there is an anatomical structure called <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tec-Chihuahua/Bees">proventriculus</A> and can close when the time comes to purify the food. He shared with us a new fact about hygienic behavior. As brood infected with AFB begin metamorphosis, proteolytic enzymes from P. larvae degrade fibers and reduce them to pure viscose biomass. Bees organs in their antennas can sense this decomposition; cleaner bees then break through the capped cell, remove the corpse, and clean the cell. All colonies of beehives exhibit this behavior being in some more marked than in others.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-7"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">We mentioned the possibility of adding the solution cell by cell, but he said we must think of the beekeeper. This just isn’t scalable for 3,000 or 4,000 boxes. We realized here that the easier the application, the more attractive the product. This made us think of secondary factors that influence our products viability, other than its antimicrobial ability. This is further discussed in our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tec-Chihuahua/Entrepreneurship">business model</A>. He noted that if the product is applied to cure it is susceptible to apply directly in the cells as mentioned above since in an apiary of 20 to 30 hives, this disease can be initiated in 2 or 3 of them, however, it should be applied as a preventive measure throughout the apiary.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">He mentioned that we should consider the effect our product would have on the bee's usual microbiome. He asked us whether our product was a remedy or a preventive measure. We answered that the design wasn't enough to pick one or the other, and it might be both.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Finally, he recommended articles and contacts for further information. He put us in contact with MSc Alejandro Romo, MSc Juan Diego Perez de la Rosa, and Dr. Alfonso Arroyo.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">He congratulated us for our work; he found our efforts and interest fascinating, especially when we put it to work to help the beekeeper community up close. He encouraged us to keep at it and invited us to the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tec-Chihuahua/Public_Engagement">XXVI International Congress for Beekeeping Updates in 2019</A>.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The chat was enlightening, and gave us valuable information for our research, hard to find in books or articles. He also recommended a website to check for information (OIE) which had epidemiological information on both foulbroods. We are still awaiting the 2018 update of foulbrood presence across the world.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">We greatly thank Ernesto Tanus for his time and disposition, especially by giving us faith and encouragement to keep going and make this a reality.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="S2" class="tabcontent1"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><H4 align="justify">June 15<SUP>th</SUP>Center for Research in Food and Development A.C.

On another hand, we looked forward to knowing the practices of in vitro bee breeding.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Four members of the team had the opportunity to travel to Cuauhtémoc and attend this visit where we invested approximately four hours, first in the laboratory and then in the field. M.S. Alejandro Romo Chacón (who has participated in more than 20 scientific dissemination articles related to bees or agriculture) welcomed us to the facilities and once we entered the laboratory he began to explain us about the bees’ life cycle and about some of the products and instruments beekeepers use to handle hives. Later, we were able to meet M.S. Adrián Ponce de León, who is researching about foulbrood bacteria, and along with M.S. Romo, he explained us about procedures and safety considerations in order to manage the in vitro growth of <I>P. larvae</I> and <I>M. plutonius</I>.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The day of our visit, M.S. Romo and M.S. Ponce de León planned to go to the bee field and carry out bee larvae transferences, for its following in vitro breeding. This activity is one of the parts that implies our project once we reach the experimentation stage with the insects and M.S. Romo and M.S. Ponce de León attentively invited us to accompany them to the field, they even lent us suits and veils to interact directly with the bees! Previously we had consulted a protocol that showed us all the details about the in vitro breeding of bees and by observing the techniques used by Ponce de León for the transference, we were able to validate and somehow, to begin with, the practice of this activity.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Interacting with the bees and being able to observe the composition of the bee boxes, the way in which the different foods were applied and the way in which beekeepers approached the bees were all key elements that allowed us to define the optimum application method of our product and helped us ensure its appropriate integration regarding each characteristic of the hive organization and the work done by beekeepers.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-7"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">When returning to the CIAD facilities we had the opportunity to discuss the use of bees in the laboratory, how many bees were used? What was this number based on? Were the three R’s considered? The reality is that in Mexico there does not exist such regulations and the bioethical part of working with bees in the laboratory is quite unattended. We found this situation somewhat unsettling and it led us to perform a more extensive analysis of this topic. (consult the bioethical essay in).</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">M.S. Romo and M.S. Ponce de León could broaden their panorama on the research that is currently being done with bees and</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><P align="justify">their diseases thanks to the sharing we made with them of our project and the allusion that synthetic biology is its fundamental part.</P><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Thanks to this visit we were able to have our first real approach with bees, we knew the reality of working with them and working with the two strains according to a specialized laboratory that has already experienced the proper biosafety considerations. This visit gave us different data that is very useful for the whole experimental plan of our project, and besides that, we lived a little of what beekeepers live every day, like traveling inside the truck with many bees that stayed inside from the field and even experiencing some bee-stings. We were also able to capture amazing photos of the hives!</P></DIV><H4 align="justify">References</H4><OL class="o"><LI>Image retrieved from: Grupo Caresner S. de R.L de C.V.

David de Jong is a professor of genetics and entomology at the University of São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto School of Medicine (specialist in pathology, biology, and management of Africanised honey bees); he is also technical Editor of an online scientific journal: Genetics and Molecular Research (GMR).</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Our team leader, human practices leader, and our ethics, legal and mathematical model representatives were present in this 40-minute call to approach issues regarding their respective divisions. David the Jong is a researcher that has written in many papers we had previously found and read on bees; we thank MVZ Ernesto Tanús for contacting us with him. First off, he was curious if we were planning to test our peptides on the bee larvae or in the colony, so far, the idea was to test them against a bacterium within a culture in the lab, we were working on the time to see if we could test them in vivo on the larvae but we were not quite sure yet. He said that was a good first step and recommend us to emphasize that on our plan.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">He was curious whether we know if it is feasible for beekeepers to eventually use our product, if it could be a costly production or if we have an idea of how much these peptides were going to cost in a final presentation. We mentioned him experimental procedures were still missing to solve these issues, like determining how much a bacterium can produce within a particular time and with given resources to give a better approximation of the cost.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">He mentioned using AMPs in food for bees was newly and thinks it's feasible for us to test in culture and then determine which combination of AMPs works best to inhibit the bacteria. Before our phone call, we sent him our detailed project description to which he recommended us to add more details on our justification as well as mention the importance of honey, money</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><P align="justify">involved in its exportation and beekeeping in Mexico. He said we should also emphasize the impact of this diseases on the whole colony and beekeeping, “the larvae are interesting, but not so important concerning the application&quot;.</P><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Regarding the application method of our product, we were considering putting nanocapsules containing our AMPs within the bee’s liquid food substitute. He said it’s feasible, but we would want to make sure bees could digest them. An excellent measure he suggested us was to eventually plan to extract the hypopharyngeal glands in bees and determine if our AMPs are entering these glands.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">He believes okay for us to supply our peptides and then try to see if they help bees resist foulbrood, as for now, he thinks it's an excellent first step if we can produce some material and prove it to work on the laboratory, he mentioned that's a paper already. He emphasized is not easy to have real larvae on the laboratory.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">We were wondering his opinion whether our AMPs could affect the larvae negatively in their development or worker bees in general. He compared or product to a human antibiotic, it kills the disease, but it also eliminates part of its microbiota, he thinks we could mention it, but we would have to test these possibilities experimentally and see what happens. He stated antibiotic treatments available now for foulbrood not always work, and they could contaminate the honey. Regarding the possibility of our AMPs getting into the honey, he thinks there are going to be low levels of our peptides, and they are going to be on the larvae, he doesn't think it's going to be a problem our AMPs getting to the honey.</P></DIV><P align="justify">If we did get to test within larvae, we asked him which would be an optimum method to find out if our peptides are getting to the developing brood.</P><OL class="o"><LI>Consider two scenarios, feeding the larvae <I>in vitro</I>, where we won't be making use of a nurse bee or the second scenario where the nurse bee feeds the larvae.</LI><LI>See if our peptides get into the worker jelly; we can look at the hypopharyngeal glands and take a worker jelly sample from the cells where larvae are swirling.</LI><LI>Finally, compare to a control</LI></OL><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">If we want to see if our AMPs are getting into the food nurse bees are feeding the larvae in the colony, we would have to use a colony or a mini colony, which is more complicated, he said. </P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">&quot;Many people have been working on ways to protect the bees, they have different systems they are using, but none of these experiments involve all these different steps you are needing because it's very ambitious and requires much time&quot;. He thinks if we can get the peptides off our bacterium and then show that they inhibit <I>P. larvae</I> and <I>M. plutonius</I>, we can talk about the next steps on a plan.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">We were wondering if our peptides could activate some biochemical signal or have the larvae reject them. He said if an animal is given something it produces, the tendency is this animal will produce less. He recommended us to see if naturally, bee AMPs get into their food, it could be that maybe if bees have available more AMPs, they disactivate the bacteria, he wasn't sure about it.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">When nanoencapsulated medicine is done, there is the risk that it can get accumulated somewhere within the organism since honey bees live within a month, he doesn't deem that is something we should worry about, yet he would say the fat body, that's the place bees tend to accumulate.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Regarding the incidence of American or European foulbrood, he mentioned he has worked in the US for control of these two diseases, the percentage was always around one percent, sometimes two. In Brazil, it's not established, they have few European foulbrood cases and there is no presence of American foulbrood, by the other hand, in Argentina, it has been a big problem. He was there to diagnose the first official finding of it, they had many thousands of colines dying, since then, some of their people went to Brazil to learn bee genetics and the incidence was very much reduced.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">In Mexico, we have the presence of Varroa, he mentioned that's a concern because is probably affecting the bee's immune system, another reason to be concerned about the AMPs levels. If we get to see if nurse bee AMPs get to the food of larvae, that is an interesting result because it helps researches understand how bees can resist diseases. Beyond the work, we are proposing, or as part of it, he thinks is interesting to have that information.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">As we continue talking about foulbrood, we asked him if it's legal to burn beehives on Brazil, he answered it’s not for someone who is not a beekeeper, the fireman is only supposed to do it if it’s a matter of environmental protection. He has burned a few beehives in a demonstration of how they control the disease when it is found, normally the government would burn beehives is there's a new problem or disease, but they are supposed to pay the beekeeper. He told us about when he was a US bee inspector, what they would do is when they find the disease, they would burn the colonies, quarantine the apiary, and tell the beekeeper he had five days to challenge, after that period, colonies that had symptoms would be burned.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">What he would do is he would burn the frames and the columns on the bees and then crush the boxes so the beekeeper couldn't put bees in it anymore, nowadays, gasoline is used. The reason he did that is he wanted to make sure all the honey was destroyed because the honey stores were contaminated with the spores of American foulbrood and if the honey wasn't destroyed, all the apiaries around would get infected. Another way the disease is spread between beekeepers is through the places where honey is processed, they bring honey from different beekeepers or different countries and process it, if it is contaminated and bees get access to it, the disease is spread in the surroundings. Another way of spreading is when a beekeeper wants to buy or sell beehives or equipment that is contaminated because they don't see the symptoms and the person who is selling or buying, doesn't know there is a contamination.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">We were curious if there were any biotechnical regulations that apply to bees in Brazil and the US regarding experimental work on them for example, for eradicating diseases. In Brazil they have no regulation affecting research with honey bees, the only regulation is involving bees in the wild. For experimental work, for instance, he is on the ethics committee of the hospital, he mentioned for human research a permission is needed as for animal research, but there are no insects’ permissions.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">He offered to contact us to speak with Erica Weinstein Teixeira, she was a student of him, she set up a laboratory and it’s a good bee pathologist. Erika has worked with viruses and diagnosis and said she probably knows about AMPs. He also offered to contact us with more researchers in his lab in case we needed to.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Ultimately, he mentioned American foulbrood was not a problem in Brazil, but in Argentina is. He sent us some papers that could be useful to our research and said it was a good project. We are thankful for his help and for his willingness to keep supporting us.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="S4" class="tabcontent1"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><H4 align="justify">October 2<SUP>nd</SUP>Video conference with Dr. Ernesto Guzmán Novoa</H4><OL class="o"><LI>To the best of his knowledge, no one has worked with bee’s antimicrobial peptide genes to treat diseases in these arthropods.</LI><LI>There might be some questions we won’t be able to answer until we get into bee experimentation, but we should consider possible risks such as the addition of external AMPs to the colony atrophying the natural production of AMPs in bees, as well as the possibility of weakening their microbiota.</LI></OL></DIV></DIV><OL class="o"><LI>He emphasized that it is not an easy project to develop as working with American and European foulbrood of honey bees is extremely complicated because of the specialized infrastructure, techniques and studies required to work with honey bee brood diseases.</LI><LI>Regarding American and European foulbrood disease presence in Canada, he stated European foulbrood predominates over American foulbrood in Canada.</LI><LI>There are no regulations in Canada concerning experimentation on bees, yet, he doesn't consider there should be since regulating it would hinder and inhibit research with them.</LI></OL><H3 align="center">Detailed Description</H3><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Dr. Ernesto Guzmán is a professor and head of the Honey Bee Research Centre at the University of Guelph; he received a DVM degree from the National Autonomous University of Mexico and a MSc and Ph.D. in entomology from the University of California, Davis.

The intention was to apply these yeasts in a solution with hexane extract of the plant <I>Achyrocline satureioides</I> which its efficiency against <I>P. larvae</I> has already been shown previouslysup&gt;2, in presence also of surfactins, the surfactin would have a synergistic effect with the hexane extract. Previous studies on <I>B. subtilis</I> have shown that surfactin, a lipopeptide produced by the bacteria, inhibits the pathogens of honey bees, including <I>P. larvae</I>, <I>A. apis</I> and <I>Nosema ceranae</I>.<SUP>1</SUP> This solution would be applied to bee bread, which we knew, the larvae ingested in their diet.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Through their feedback, we evaluated the risks of using yeasts in our product and the risks of introducing GMOs in what is known as &quot;harmless honey&quot;. They emphasized that an overdose of yeasts would cause a fermentation of the honey and an alteration in the microbiota of the bees which could be counterproductive since this would cause diseases such as American foulbrood to arrive, they recommended us to be very careful with the dose and consider the addition of a fermentation inhibitor in our formula. From this meeting, we set out to investigate the export requirements of honey, which is the main product exported by beekeepers, and how our genetically modified yeasts would affect or play a role in these requirements.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">One issue we were asked to review was whether the hexane extract of <I>A.satureioides</I> is oxidized because if so, it loses its qualities. Currently, a treatment that they use to fight diseases in bees is the oregano essential oil which they have already found to be oxidized. After further investigation, we verified that certainly, the extract that we wanted to add is oxidized by exposure to air. Another treatment that beekeepers use to fight diseases, is the sodium bicarbonate which, when it is spread in the hive, causes the bees to begin a cleaning protocol with which they take that bicarbonate out of their hive taking away the dirt present.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">They mentioned they do not usually have much time to try different combinations of treatments and find out the optimal combination. They said there is not much research in the beekeeping sector, so it seems excellent that we intend to carry out scientific research in this field and try different combinations of peptides thus ensuring the best combination.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">They also told us about other bee pathogens, <I>Nosema apis</I> and <I>Varroa destructor</I>. They commented that, if effective, our product is excellent, however, they also mentioned that in general there are many good products at a reasonable price, however, they are challenging to work with. Occasional applications are less complicated than regular ones. They look for a practical alternative, cheap and that doesn't consume time. Concerning the final product being a dilution, they commented that this was difficult to apply since, if our product was to be applied frequently, it would be laborious to have to spray every three days, for example, 2,000 boxes of bees.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Subsequently, they mentioned that, in their city, the foulbrood that represents a problem is the European, which occurs when bees have limited accessibility to pollen due to the few flowering throughout the year. Previously we had read about this disease; however, it was from this meeting that we investigated more about it and after validating the theoretical efficacy of our antimicrobial peptides of interest against this disease, we decided to address it as part of the pathogens to combat with our product.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Finally, they congratulated us for our research and stressed the importance of feedback between researcher and producer since this way we can collaborate in a more effective way, guaranteeing a bidirectional communication. They invited us to continue attending their meetings and MSc Alejandro Romo, a researcher at the Center for Food Research and Development (For its acronym in Spanish: CIAD), offered us to experiment with his bees in his laboratory in Cuauhtémoc.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">After this meeting, our project changed to production of antimicrobial peptides in Escherichia coli for the inhibition of <I>Paenibacillus larvae</I> and <I>Melissococcus plutonius</I></P></DIV><SMALL><H4 align="justify">References</H4><OL class="o"><LI>Wu, M., Sugimura, Y., Iwata, K., Takaya, N., Takamatsu, D., Kobayashi, M., … Yoshiyama, M.

Successfully, after exchanging some emails we were able to schedule a virtual meeting with the FAI presidential staff member Lorenzo Della Morte. We were very excited to have the opportunity to share and also nurture our project with insights, concerns and regulations that came from the city that hosts the headquarters of many important multinational food companies and agencies, such as the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and The World Food Programme (WFP). Eight members of the team could attend this important reunion that lasted approximately 40 minutes.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-9"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">FAI President Raffaele Cirone and his staff member Lorenzo Della Morte shared with us very invaluable information about how foulbrood is experienced in Italy:</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Foulbrood incidence rate in Italy usually has a seasonal trend with the largest number of registered infections during the second semester of the year (July-December). Regarding the impact and incidence of these two diseases on Italian beekeeping, FAI Italian Federation of Beekeepers has consulted the National Centre of Reference on bee diseases, who elaborated an official data reporting 51 complaints of colony infections from 7 on the 20 Italian Regions, for the year 2017. The number of infected and then destroyed colonies is a few tens of units compared to the 1.300.000 colonies, which constitute the Italian beekeeping heritage.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">From the FAI point of view, the data is not to be considered statistically reliable both for the low number of registered cases and for the missing complaints. In fact, in order to avoid the Veterinarian Police controls, many beekeepers often don’t report the infection and directly destroy the colonies in secret. According to FAI estimates the incidence rate of foulbrood can’t be lower than the 10-20% of the Italian beekeeping heritage in total.</P></DIV><P align="justify">The treatment methods used in Italy to treat AFB and EFB are the following:</P><OL class="o"><LI><B>For AFB</B>:<P align="justify">Must be compulsorily notifiable to the Health Authority. It involves serious restrictive measures in accordance with the Veterinarian Police Regulation (DPR 8/2/1954, n.320). Apart from the Beekeeping Best Practices (BBP) there are no official and authorized control methodologies so that the infected colonies must be burned. Furthermore, the apiary is subject to health constraints until the recovery plan has been ascertained. All the beekeeper’s instruments must be disinfected and sterilized.</P></LI><LI><B>For EFB</B>:<P align="justify">Must be compulsorily notifiable to the Health Authority. It involves serious restrictive measures in accordance with the Veterinarian Police Regulation (DPR 8/2/1954, n.320). Differently, from the American foulbrood (AFB) regulation, the European foulbrood (EFB), has a less restricted regulation. In fact, the infected colonies must be distinguished in two different clusters related to their clinical picture:</P></LI><OL class="d"><LI><I>Severely compromised colonies</I>: In this case, the approach is the same as the one for AFB and it lies in destroying both the colony and the hive and in disinfecting and sterilizing the beekeeper’s instruments.</LI><LI><I>Not compromised colonies but with clinical signs</I>: In this case, the “swarming technique” is carried out to overcome the disease. It consists of:</LI><OL class="e"><LI>Removing the infected combs from the hive.</LI><LI>Replacing the queen bee.</LI><LI>Adding adult bees from external healthy colonies.</LI><LI>Feeding bees with an appropriate nutrition.</LI><LI>Further practices suggested by the veterinarian in charge.</LI></OL></OL></OL><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The apiary will be seized for at least 9 days and until the positive outcome of the treatment, in order to assess the efficacy of the “swarming technique”. Anyway, also, in this case, the beekeeper can ask the destruction of all the affected colonies to the veterinarian authority.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">In both the cases AFB and EFB, the use of antibiotics is not allowed in Italy because of its ineffectiveness and to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">FAI emphasized a very important point that seems not only to apply in Italy but throughout the whole world: there are no different solutions to AFB and EFB diseases these days and the legislative tools are often perceived as repressive, so many beekeepers don’t notify the infection in their apiary, destroying the infected colonies and concealing the fact. This is one of the most relevant problems for the health and statistical assessment studies.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">After Mr. Della Morte learned about our project and the scopes of synthetic biology regarding beekeeping, he considered our proposal as a possibility of prevention method against the diseases. Our product would help beekeepers do not have to lose all their beehives and save money.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">After the video call, Mr. Raffaele Cirone and his staff reflected on our project information and kindly sent us their final insights:</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The Italian Federation of Beekeepers believes that AMPABEE Project is a new and innovative approach to such incurable diseases as AFB and EFB. Preventing the spread of these bacteria and increasing the immune system of bee larvae is an important goal to achieve in the health bee risk prevent. In particular, nowadays the only preventing tools are the Beekeeping Best Practices (BBP) which depends on the personal application beekeepers carry out. In this respect, FAI considers essential to test this research on the pure Italian <I>Apis mellifera ligustica</I>, as it is the most widespread in the world. In this regard, FAI will collaborate and provide the necessary support, remaining at iGEM team Tec-Chihuahua disposal in case of need for further information for the research project and programme. FAI is totally sure that such a research could find a spreading interest in the beekeeping world at different scales. FAI can support the product commercialization thanks to the FAI’s Service Company and the FAI trade partnerships covering the entire national territory.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="A3" class="tabcontent1"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><H4 align="justify">July 27<SUP>th</SUP>, 28<SUP>th</SUP>, and 29<SUP>th</SUP>IV State Beekeeping Forum</H4><OL class="o"><LI>The forum was held in the Chihuahuan Desert Museum and had an approximate of 340 attendees from the state including beekeepers from the Cuauhtemoc’s beekeeping society, attendees from other states and from the country of Chile.</LI><LI>We had the opportunity to speak with diverse beekeeping companies.</LI><LI>Beekeepers spoke about the current contamination that exists in honey, the main problems are antibiotics, sulfonamides are still used in many parts of the country.</LI><LI>We were the closure presentation of the event.

The immediate environmental impact of urban settlements derives from a change in land purpose<SUP>5</SUP>, reducing the size of crops that can be pollinated by bees, generating an effect similar to that of habitat loss and with this, nutritional complications in bees, conferring susceptibility to diseases. This is one of the points suggested by the engineer Alejandro Bianchi during our meeting on June 15, 2018. </P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify"> However, there are actions that seek to provide a healthy life for bees and their existence. There is a concern for the negative impact on anthophiles by irresponsible human activities; it is vital to prevent and attack the causes of bee reduction or loss at their roots. As we learned thanks to <B>MEXMUN 2018</B>, the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity should be used.

Cedar, specifically red cedar (<I>Cedrela odorata</I>), is considered the best type of wood to make a hive. However, this species is subject to special protection according to NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010, which means factors that negatively affect its viability may threaten it. Obtaining permission to perform the practice of incinerating hives becomes an arduous and even deficient process.

</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-9"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Classic economics tells us that it is time put into a product or service which gives it its value. Beekeepers know about this; they work all the time, with a lot of hives. They must take care of each colony, all while creating smoke to keep the bees passive.

In our effort to consider all these needs in our project, we managed to have interviews with professionals related to the topic in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Italy, Valencia, and Canadá, taking into account from beekeepers who manage few hives to complete associations, investigators, governmental institutions and international agencies. We considered specific needs to obtain a universal solution.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">In the <B>IV State’s Beekeeping Forum</B> and the <B>CIAD</B> visit, we were able to experience what beekeepers’ work involves. Working with few beehives lessen the job, however in the case of beekeepers like the Chilean Bryaan Saaverdra, that works with more than 1000 hives the work notably intensifies, as you must attend beehive by beehive whatever the weather condition is. Through the application method of our product, which was transformed over the months basing on the concerns and needs of the beekeepers, we foster the welfare of this community taking in consideration for their working days not to become intensified when experiencing the diseases and applying the product. </P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-9"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">In the meeting with <B>Mr. Manuel Ramírez Salcido</B>, he commented on how there are almost no young people who are interested in beekeeping and that there is a significant concern for the future of this sector. While developing our project, we saw the enthusiasm of beekeepers for seeing young people interested in the area. Throughout all these months we have shared our project in many places, we have tried to bring the youth to be interested in bee’s importance and beekeeping. For the <B>IV State’s Beekeeping Forum</B> we made an open invitation to different year students of our biotechnology career, encouraging them to attend, to listen  to  the  conferences  and  learn  about  apiaries .

Many times, beekeepers who have affected hives, do not report it because of the negative implications that this entails; burning of colonies, the need of using antibiotics that disturb the innocuity of honey and finally the risk of losing investment made over many years. Our product promotes this social problem to be resolved; by having a profitable and useful product, which displace conventional antibiotics usage and the burning of hives. It encourages that the beekeeper openly reports if their beehives suffer from the disease having the peace of mind that he will not have to lose large quantities of money or their hives nor he will need to alter their bee products with antibiotics. </P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">By addressing individual concerns as well as general insights such as the problem of statistical assessment studies, throughout the development of our project and the implementation of the product, we seek to address aspects that are often out of the hands of beekeepers, and that may also have an impact on communities outside of the beekeeping sector.
