I’m about to start the 7th semester of my career which is Biotechnology Engineering. I am excited to develop our bee project and beeing part of the iGEM community. I enjoy learning about other countries and traditions so that is why I was a Rotary Youth Exchange student in Brazil 5 years ago. I love traveling, Shakira’s old songs, rainy days and FOOD. My first laboratory experiment consisted in creating José Pablo Rascón Pérez a palm tree who makes photosynthesis. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><H3>Pablo Espinoza Hernandez</H3><P align="justify"> Hello there! I’m a 19 years old biotechnology engineering student. I just finished the 2nd semester and I am excited for what is coming next. Curiosity has always been inside me and science is a great way to fulfill that hunger of me for new knowledge. I have a huge love for sci-fi, 90's Hip-Hop, Space science, SpaceX, traveling, new cultures, chemistry and I like to call myself a dreamer for a better tomorrow, I like to practice sports, such as box and Tae Kwon Do. I speak Spanish as my native language, English as my second an currently learning to speak Brazilian Portuguese “Ate Grand Jamboree”.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><H3>César A.

What I enjoy the most is lab work and the smile of my boyfriend. An interesting fact is that I can fall asleep quickly anywhere at any time and nothing wakes me up. My favorite part of the day is the sunset, it sounds cliche but seeing it fills my soul with joy and happiness. My aim is to make the best of every minute and live life to the fullest. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><H3>José Pablo Rascón Pérez</H3><P align="justify">I’m 21 years old, currently in my 7th semester as a student of biotechnology engineering.

I like to play volleyball, read and spend time with my siblings and parents. I enjoy learning new and diverse things, I think is one of the reasons why I am on an iGEM team. I like to be prepared and have the answer, if I do not have it, I dedicate myself to find it. I consider myself fortunate to have the opportunity to discover new paths alongside my friends (the guys on this page). I have plans for my future, even if they change, I am pleased with what I am doing now. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="footer"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="center"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-3"><H3 style="text-align:center">Follow us on  social media:</H3></DIV><DIV class="col-md-9"><H3 style="text-align:center">We thank our sponsors:</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
