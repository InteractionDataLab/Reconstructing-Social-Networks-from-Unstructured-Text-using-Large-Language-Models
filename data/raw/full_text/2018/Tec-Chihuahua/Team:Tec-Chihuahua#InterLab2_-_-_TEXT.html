Interlab Study 2018
The goal of the iGEM InterLab Study is to identify and correct the sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology measurements. In order to address this challenge, the iGEM committee provides researchers with detailed protocols and requires data analysis on the measurement of GFP. This year, the million dollar question is: Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD?
For more information, check out iGEM's official InterLab Study webpage . Below are the protocols we used and the data that we collected for the InterLab Study.
