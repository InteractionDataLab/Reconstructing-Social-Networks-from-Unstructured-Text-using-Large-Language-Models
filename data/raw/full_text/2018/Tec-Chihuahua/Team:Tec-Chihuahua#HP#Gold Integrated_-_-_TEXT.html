IV Foro Estatal de Apicultura
We were given the opportunity to participate in the “IV  Foro estatal de apicultura“ (IV Apiculture State Forum)  which was held in the city of Delicias the days 27, 28 and 29 of July. This event consisted in the presentation of technical advances related to this economic activity for the beekeepers to give their product an added value.The Delicias association of beekeepers invited us to present our project for its relevance in apiculture and what it represents for future technologies and researches to come, we also had the opportunity to meet the representatives of SAGARPA from our state in order to settle some doubts regarding the legal aspect of our project as well as asking for their help in contacting someone who could give us advice in our technical part.
We met with Dr. Ernesto Tanuz Sánchez who gave us some advice previously through a video meeting and a meeting, he told us he was going to assist to the forum. He saw our advance since our last meeting, he introduced us with Dr. Sóstenes Rafael Rodríguez Dehaib, the actual director of COMVERMIEL, he also works as a professor of apiculture in the University of Veracruz, he was the technical coordinator of Citrofrut Honey and he has made many apiculture pieces of research and is in charge of 2 different bee researching centers, he as well participates as an assessor for honey regulations with the EU and the TLCAN. We asked him about
the presence of our peptides in the honey as it may be a problem for beekeepers that the normal concentration rises up, he told us that since the AMP´s we are using are already part of the honey mix the beekeepers won’t have a problem when it comes to exportation regulations in Europe and USA.
We were the closure presentation for the event, we presented our project to the many beekeepers who where present, they gave us their support as we asked for their feedback on our techniques and application methods, they told us we were doing an impressive research and saw huge potential in our work as a real solution for their foulbrood problem as well as a possible treatment for Nosema and Varroa, they invited us to their bee farms for us to make experimentation on their bees if we wanted to do further research in the future, we thanked them for their support and finished the event by inviting us to the international forum for beekeeping techniques update in our city of Chihuahua on may 2019 where they want us to present the product if possible or at least a finished research since they remarked the impact that this product could have in their business as an alternative to bee hive burning and antibiotics usage, we accepted their invitation and thanked them again for all the opportunities they have given us as well as their confidence in us and the project.
We polled the present beekeepers to get some data for our statistics on the foulbrood, while doing so we came along 2 chilean beekeepers who now live in México, they told us about honey commerce and which problems they have come along during the 5 years they have been exporting worldwide and offered us any help we need for our entrepreneurship and best-integrated area and before leaving they presented us with another chilean beekeeper who lives in chihuahua too, he told us that if we ever needed something for our project we could contact him and ask for any advice.
