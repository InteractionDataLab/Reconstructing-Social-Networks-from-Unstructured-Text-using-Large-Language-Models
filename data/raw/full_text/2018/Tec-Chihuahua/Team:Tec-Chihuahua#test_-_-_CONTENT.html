This human right constitutes a guarantee for the realization and validity of the rest, since human being are in an indissoluble relationship with its environment and nature<SUP>1</SUP>. For this reason, achieving sustainable development would ensure the quality of present and future life. In this sense, the dignity, autonomy, and sanctity of the person depend on the health of the planet, its resources, and species. </P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify"> Food Security is a central topic in the global agenda. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that by the year 2050, world population will exceed 9,000 million, of which 150 million will dwell in Mexico. This should increase agricultural production by 60% in the country by that year <SUP>2</SUP>. </P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-9"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Beekeeping is a fundamental activity to achieve Food Security in Mexico and the world, which is why authorities, researchers, farmers, beekeepers, and members are aware of the importance of bees. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says 100 crop species provide 90% of the food worldwide, and bees pollinate 71% of these<SUP>3</SUP>. It is for this reason, given by the engineer <B>Manuel Ramirez Salcido</B>, that bees have been presented as a parameter of environmental health, talking about ecology.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA) says that if bees disappear there would be a food crisis; 84% of cash crops</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><P align="justify">depend on their pollination.<SUP>4</SUP> In the same way, SAGARPA states that multiple varieties of fruit trees depend on cross-pollination that uses animals as vectors, such as bees; that is to say that there is an enormous amount of zoophilic plants.</P><DIV class="a"><P align="justify"> According to the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), the links between the population, environment, and natural resources are mediated by multiple factors. The immediate environmental impact of urban settlements derives from a change in land purpose<SUP>5</SUP>, reducing the size of crops that can be pollinated by bees, generating an effect similar to that of habitat loss and with this, nutritional complications in bees, conferring susceptibility to diseases. This is one of the points suggested by the engineer Alejandro Bianchi during our meeting on June 15, 2018. </P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify"> However, there are actions that seek to provide a healthy life for bees and their existence. There is a concern for the negative impact on anthophiles by irresponsible human activities; it is vital to prevent and attack the causes of bee reduction or loss at their roots. As we learned thanks to <B>MEXMUN 2018</B>, the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity should be used. These objectives are: </P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-9"><OL class="o"><LI>Conservation of biodiversity.

</LI></OL><DIV class="a"><P align="justify"><B>Dr. Ernesto Tanus Sánchez</B> mentioned the importance of avoiding the burning of hives, due to the limited accessibility to the wood with which they are made. Cedar, specifically red cedar (<I>Cedrela odorata</I>), is considered the best type of wood to make a hive. However, this species is subject to special protection according to NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010, which means factors that negatively affect its viability may threaten it. Obtaining permission to perform the practice of incinerating hives becomes an arduous and even deficient process. Due to the virulence of <I>Paenibacillus larvae</I>, American Foulbrood sweeps entire hives before there is an answer by the authorities. </P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify"> In other Latin American countries, the action plan presents variations. <B>Ph.D. David De Jong</B> explained us how in Brazil, it is not permissible for someone to incinerate a beehive if it is not a beekeeper, sometimes the firefighters do it in an emergency. <B>Bryan Saavedra</B>, mentioned how in Chile, they have the Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG) who is in charge of incinerating hives in case the disease is present.

</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-9"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Classic economics tells us that it is time put into a product or service which gives it its value.

Since the national Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (<B>SAGARPA</B>) is also strict on contaminants, <B>Guillermo Rodriguéz</B> told us, a natural product against foulbrood is needed both nationally and internationally.</P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-9"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">As explained in the chronology of the aforementioned facts, while the project was being developed and basing us on the comments and concerns expressed by professionals, we were able to ensure that our product would not impede exportations and importations of honey. The world honey market reported historical records during 2015, with volumes of operation exceeding 2.3 billion dollars<SUP>1</SUP> and it represents substantial revenues not only for Mexico but countries like China, Argentina, Spain, etc. More than ensuring that highest AMP concentrations in honey would not result in an exportation problem, our project fosters to make exportations go up since there will be no problem with antibiotic residues in honey when beekeepers have to deal with diseases.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The economic part of our project is also made up of the development of the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tec-Chihuahua/Entrepreneurship">entrepreneurial area</A> where the implications for the sale of the final product are analyzed.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Our project will make sure Foulbrood no longer generates huge economic losses (by killing bees and necessitating antibiotics) but instead become a small nuisance in an otherwise thriving industry.</P></DIV><BUTTON class="collapsible3"><H4 align="center">References</H4></BUTTON><DIV class="contentw"><OL class="o"><LI>PROCCyT.

In our effort to consider all these needs in our project, we managed to have interviews with professionals related to the topic in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Italy, Valencia, and Canadá, taking into account from beekeepers who manage few hives to complete associations, investigators, governmental institutions and international agencies. We considered specific needs to obtain a universal solution.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">In the <B>IV State’s Beekeeping Forum</B> and the <B>CIAD</B> visit, we were able to experience what beekeepers’ work involves. Working with few beehives lessen the job, however in the case of beekeepers like the Chilean Bryaan Saaverdra, that works with more than 1000 hives the work notably intensifies, as you must attend beehive by beehive whatever the weather condition is. Through the application method of our product, which was transformed over the months basing on the concerns and needs of the beekeepers, we foster the welfare of this community taking in consideration for their working days not to become intensified when experiencing the diseases and applying the product. </P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-9"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">In the meeting with <B>Mr. Manuel Ramírez Salcido</B>, he commented on how there are almost no young people who are interested in beekeeping and that there is a significant concern for the future of this sector. While developing our project, we saw the enthusiasm of beekeepers for seeing young people interested in the area. Throughout all these months we have shared our project in many places, we have tried to bring the youth to be interested in bee’s importance and beekeeping. For the <B>IV State’s Beekeeping Forum</B> we made an open invitation to different year students of our biotechnology career, encouraging them to attend, to listen  to  the  conferences  and  learn  about  apiaries .

Many times, beekeepers who have affected hives, do not report it because of the negative implications that this entails; burning of colonies, the need of using antibiotics that disturb the innocuity of honey and finally the risk of losing investment made over many years. Our product promotes this social problem to be resolved; by having a profitable and useful product, which displace conventional antibiotics usage and the burning of hives. It encourages that the beekeeper openly reports if their beehives suffer from the disease having the peace of mind that he will not have to lose large quantities of money or their hives nor he will need to alter their bee products with antibiotics. </P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">By addressing individual concerns as well as general insights such as the problem of statistical assessment studies, throughout the development of our project and the implementation of the product, we seek to address aspects that are often out of the hands of beekeepers, and that may also have an impact on communities outside of the beekeeping sector.
