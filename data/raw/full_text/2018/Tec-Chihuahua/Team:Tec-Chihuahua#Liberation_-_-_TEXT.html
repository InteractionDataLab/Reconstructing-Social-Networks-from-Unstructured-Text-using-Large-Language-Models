Mathematical modelling
The mathematical model is based on the diffusion from the antimicrobial peptide in the interior of the PLGA nanoparticle to the exterior of it. The behavior of releasing is generally described as a combination of Fickian and non-Fickian movement. In the Fickian movement, the areas with high concentration spread to those with a lower concentration and this is known as diffusion. This is mathematically described by the equation:  (1).
Where Mt is the drug (Amps) release at time t, M8 the amps released at the infinite time, k is the kinetic constant, n is an exponent and a is the drug released for the initial burst, which is a normal behavior of PLGA-drug release systems where  quantity of initial drug is released independently of time.
