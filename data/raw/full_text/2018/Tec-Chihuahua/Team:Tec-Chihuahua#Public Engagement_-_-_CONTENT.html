The essential goal we had in the developing of our Education and Public Engagement area was getting more people involved in some way or another to science. However, there are some previous steps we considered critical to do before explaining our project to other people. For this reason, we found necessary to give people an introduction to what is Synthetic Biology.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">We identified the four fundamental questions that we think every team who wishes to do a great Education and Public Engagement section should abide by. Here we share this questions:</P></DIV><OL><LI><P align="justify"><B>Which organizations are related to my topic?</B> Identify the organizations or institutions linked to your project.</P></LI><LI><P align="justify"><B>In those organizations, with whom can we get close to have the first approach?</B> Contact the right person related to the area you are looking for and have a better two-way dialog.</P></LI><LI><P align="justify"><B>By taking this first approach, how can they help us reach the society?</B> Tell him/her what you want to do to enhance society's way of thinking. Don't forget to establish your storyboard and your limits, remember that something concise and well developed is much better than vague and incomplete tasks.</P></LI><LI><P align="justify"><B>What are we going to do to make this changes happen?</B> Set your working model and prepare everything with enough time. Remind to get to people's thoughts as well as people's hearts.</P></LI></OL><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">These four questions worked very well for our team and we share them with the objective of <B>helping others</B> develop their Education and Public Engagement section.

In our case, we were able to help in a <B>week full of biotechnology engineering activities</B> and welcome students into undergraduate projects. Introductory topics week was from February 26th to March 2nd.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">This was our very first Education and Public Engagement activity. There were around <B>30 high school students</B> who made activities such as molecular gastronomy, a mouse dissection, nitrogen ice cream, oocyte extraction, electrophoresis, between others.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">At the end of this week, we wanted to help them see how they can apply what they had done during the week in a real project. Therefore, we presented these alumni <B>synthetic biology</B> for the first time.

As well, we had the chance to <B>answer some questions</B> that emerged in some students related to this new technology.</P><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">To end our presentation, we invited them to attend to our grill for raising funds so we could be able to start with our wet lab.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="two" class="tabcontent"><H3 align="center">Meeting with Beekeepers</H3><DIV class="a"><P align="center"><I>“Feedback between researcher and producer is very important because, this way, we can collaborate more effectively, ensuring a two-way communication.”</I></P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-9"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">These were the words beekeepers from our community told us when we presented them our first bee project proposal in one of their monthly meetings. Here was when we started looking for external support and found great results. We found out that these meetings take place every first Saturday of the month in Cuauhtémoc, Chihuahua, Mexico, where beekeepers discuss and plan activities in benefit of bees.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">We looked and spoke to the president of the Beekeepers Society in Cuauhtémoc looking for his approval and feedback about the project.

For this reason, more people need to know that <B>science has improved</B>, creating innovative and less risking solutions to agricultural issues and biodiversity in general. Thanks to this comment we decided to <B>work hard</B> for Education and Public Engagement, we wanted to get to people’s hearts so they could create their own point of view for these situations.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Was here when we explained to them what <B>synthetic biology</B> involved and how we were working with it to aid the beekeeping field.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">We could identify one of their greatest fears in the beekeeping business, but the question is, <B>fear of what?</B> Simple, they are afraid that their honey is rejected by European countries when they export it due to the use of GMOs since they are an essential Mexican honey buyer.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Here we could <B>learn and detect</B> one of the most important problems in beekeeping and got more convinced that proposing a scientific solution to this problems could help them broaden their horizons. We needed to make sure that they understood how synthetic biology worked without needing to leave GMOs in the resulting honey, which we did. This task was done by preparing beekeepers a simple presentation with terms that were comprehensible for them, where we explained some examples of how it has been used in the last few years.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">After this, we presented our first research project proposal and they told us some feedback that we used later to integrate and improve it.

Having said that, we think that they should know how synthetic biology can influence their business with our given approach. For us, it's very important to keep in touch with the people who are directly related to bees. Therefore, we went ahead with the task of making a bigger step and getting more informed citizens and more conscious beekeepers.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">After our meeting with beekeepers in Cuauhtémoc, we noticed that beekeepers needed to  stay  updated  with </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><P align="justify">science and that besides reaching our locality,  we wanted to <B>embrace our state</B>.</P><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">That’s why we participated in the <B>“IV Foro Estatal de Apicultura”</B> (4th State’s Beekeeping Forum in English), to discuss what is behind synthetic biology and to let people who are not related with the laboratory know that this new area of genetic engineering is not that far away.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">This event took place from July 27th through July 29th in our state in the city of Delicias, a couple of hours away from our home.

This initiative was firstly introduced at Harvard with the objective to create relationships between students and important researchers, besides spreading science to young people. Thanks to this, CdeCMx has designed an education model for these areas called <I>Clubs</I>. These <I>Clubs</I> target <B>high school and undergraduate</B> students with the objective of making them learn theoretical and practical aspects of these topics.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-9"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Each <I>Club</I> is developed by a team of young scientists from the most prestigious universities and research institutions in Mexico and the United States. Each summer, the organization carries out the week of CdeCMx in several cities in the country with the partnership of multiple institutions.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">One of the best things this organization has to offer is that every <I>Club</I> is free thus everyone who is interested in science has the opportunity to attend.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">This is a project that involves 9 different headquarters in Mexico. It has over 162 <I>Clubs</I>, 300 instructors and 2200 students within the country. In Chihuahua, our university, the “Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, Campus Chihuahua” was one of the 9 headquarters in Mexico for this important event.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Our campus hosted <B>120 undergraduate students</B> from different institutions along the city who were advised by <B>12 professors</B> that shared their knowledge and applied it to theoretical and practical lessons. 6 <I>Clubs</I> took place in our campus throughout the week and counted with instructors from different institutions.

That's why we decided to support one of the <I>Clubs</I> given at our campus which was <B>“El mundo real de la biotecnología”</B> (The real world of biotechnology in English).</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">This <I>Club</I> taught students the key concepts in molecular biology and practical lab activities to use living organisms, such as bacteria, to modify a product or process for a specific use. The activities given in the <I>Club</I> were microbiology, prokaryotic cellular cultures, bacterial transformation, DNA purification, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and electrophoresis techniques.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">We had the opportunity to help researchers and staff of the <I>Club</I> by preparing everything the students were going to need to make the scheduled activities mentioned above. We provided them with lab materials such as Petri dishes, culture media, competent cells, and GFP and RFP vectors so they could proceed with the activities.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">On the last day, there was a space scheduled in the closure of the event called <B>“Programs for an approach to science in Mexico”</B>. Throughout the week we related to Oscar Pineda-Catalan and Sonia Hernández, both instructors from the <B>University of Chicago</B>. They showed interest in our team and were amazed by the social impact we had been making with beekeepers. For this reason, we were invited to talk to students in the closure of the <I>Club</I> “Material Science: it looks like magic, but is real”.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">In this <I>Club</I>, we presented who we were, what we were working on, and how synthetic biology has led us to contribute something to the beekeeping field. For us, this was a great opportunity because we wanted to wake up youth's curiosity by introducing them to the <B>synthetic biology</B> field and also inspire them to participate in programs that offer an approach to <B>science in Mexico.</B></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="five" class="tabcontent"><H3 align="center">iGEM as LIFE</H3><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">At this point of our Education and Public Engagement section, we have already done activities that involved beekeepers and people completely unrelated to science. In this case, we wanted to have a different approach to include people of different ages. We discovered that adults and beekeepers had a great response</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-9"><P align="justify">to technologies and that they were open-minded to learn new things. For this reason, we wanted to try this teaching method in a distinct sector. We wanted to <B>reach the learning community</B> which led us to get close to it by looking for ways to get involved with young people. After establishing our plan on how we could achieve this, we found the LiFE department at our university and asked for information about it.</P><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">LiFE (Liderazgo y Formación Estudiantil in Spanish) symbolizes <B>Leadership and Student Training</B>.  It  is  a  new  education  model  for  the  student  life  in  Tecnológico  de  Monterrey.  The  program  provides  us,  as  alumni,  a  comprehensive  education  that</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><P align="justify">enhances our personal capabilities, leadership, and self-realization, considering our physical, emotional and spiritual balance.</P><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Knowing this, iGEM Tec Chihuahua decided to be part of LiFE and we <B>registered the team</B> as part of it. We got informed of what we needed to make our team a student group that belonged to LiFE and joined right away. LiFE encourages student groups to <B>involve themselves with people</B> who may be interested in their desired topic by <B>making activities</B> that result interesting to the audience, which was perfect for the approach we were looking for.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">We attach below the official picture of iGEM at Tecnológico de Monterrey as part of LiFE.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The approach we gave to the group was <B>synthetic biology</B>. Our main objective is to attend to different schools where synthetic biology is not conferred and <B>teach alumni</B> what we have learned about this new technology throughout these months. We seek to communicate our acquired knowledge, express ideas and share information in order to <B>light up interest in science</B> on high school students.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">So far we have gone to the UVM (University of the Mexican Valley) and gave high school students an introduction of <B>what synthetic biology means</B> and some concepts we considered meaningful to teach. For this first visit, we contacted Dr. Sonia Chavira Ríos, who is a <B>teacher</B> at this school. We explained what we wanted to present to her 11th-grade students and she accepted. She found our topic enlightening for her science class and gave iGEM Tec-Chihuahua a space to present. We went to UVM High School on September 18th where we talked about DNA, base pairs that shape DNA, genes, plasmids, genetic engineering, synthetic biology, and recombinant DNA.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">As well, we had the opportunity to ground all the theoretical information by talking about how we <B>applied synthetic biology</B> and <B>genetic engineering</B> to our iGEM project. We explained to them how we made our bacterial transformation and how we obtain the protein production. As well, we wanted to keep in touch with them in case of any doubts they could have so we annexed our contact to keep communication.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Below you can find the presentation we showed them:</P></DIV><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><H4 class="panel-title"><CENTER><A data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapse2"><DIV class="col-md-12">UVM Slideshow <DIV class="noDown" style="position: absolute; top: 30px; right: 30px;">▼</DIV></DIV></A></CENTER></H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">By attending this class, besides teaching, we also learned a few things. We <B>detected</B> that several students were interested in science. High schools manage these topics in a simple way in order to invite the student to look more about it. The problem is that not every student knows where to get close to receive more information. Analyzing this situation, we decided to <B>keep attending high schools</B> with the same approach throughout the semester.

For us, spreading knowledge is one of our main goals. We want to make people <B>think out of the box</B> and imagine scenarios where synthetic biology can aim to  environmental  alternatives and solve serious humanity problems but we also know that if it isn’t used correctly, things can go out of control and make everything go wrong.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">For this MUN we wanted to approach students and help them see how synthetic biology can be used or misused. Our objective with this topic is that <B>students search for information</B> on how every country is dealing with this new emerging technology in order to <B>keep youth updated.</B></P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">That's why we emailed Arturo Martínez, General Secretary of MEXMUN 2018, and asked him a space for iGEM Tec-Chihuahua in this year’s edition.
