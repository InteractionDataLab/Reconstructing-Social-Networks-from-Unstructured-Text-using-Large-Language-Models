Our team consists of third, fifth, and seventh-semester Biotechnology Engineering students, all united for learning, science, and technology, as well as by having a common goal, developing an amazing project!
Alejandra Cervantes
Hi there! I’m 19 years old and I'm coursing my third semester of Biotechnology Engineering. With iGEM, I realized that I fell in love with science and also convinced myself that this is what I want to do the rest of my life. Besides science, I’m heavily addicted to cheese and also love swimming and making people smile. I’m currently learning German as my third language and also looking for learning even more.
Ana Laura Ortega
Hi! I’m eighteen years old and just about to start my third semester in Biotechnology Engineering. I have always loved nature and still get surprised every day with it; iGEM is a great opportunity to learn more about it. I love avocados, dancing and getting to know other countries and cultures, I really enjoy learning different languages. I’m glad to be part of this amazing team and wondering what this new experience will bring.
Anna Karen Aguilar
I am nineteen years old and just about to start my third semester in Biotechnology Engineering. I like to play volleyball, read and spend time with my siblings and parents. I enjoy learning new and diverse things, I think is one of the reasons why I am on an iGEM team. I like to be prepared and have the answer, if I do not have it, I dedicate myself to find it. I consider myself fortunate to have the opportunity to discover new paths alongside my friends (the guys on this page). I have plans for my future, even if they change, I am pleased with what I am doing now.
César Ibrahym Rodríguez
Hey! I'm a 19-year-old Biotechnology Engineering student. Science has always been a part of me, as well as football, especially when Steelers play, and music, playing piano and guitar. One last thing I really like is learning new languages, currently German, and new accents. Let’s see how this goes, I’m thankful to be in and motivated to be part of a great project! #TeamCesar
César Aarón Villalobos
I'm a 20-year-old carbon-based lifeform that used to spend his time doing fun things before iGEM. Now my days as a beer pong partner, meme connoisseur, and tabletop game champion are a distant memory. #TeamCesar
Daniela Oloño
Hey there! I’m a 19-year-old student, right now studying my 3rd semester of Biotechnology Engineering. Scientific curiosity and the idea of acquiring new skills and knowledge brought me to join this team. I’m looking forward to taking the most out of this incredible experience. Besides science, I love my dog, crafting, participating in outdoor activities, and spending time with my family and friends.
Edmundo Noel Valenzuela
Hey there! I'm a 19 years old guy who loves biotechnology and is a true believer that science is the key to decipher the universe secrets. Also, I love swimming, hamburgers, and astronomy. That's all you need to know about me by now outside the fact I'm the craziest and baby member of the team.
Michelle Alejandra Parada
Hey there! My name is Michelle Parada, I’m a 20-year-old biotechnology engineering student, a music lover and an optimist hearted. Something about me is I'm not afraid to show myself as I am and I surround myself with people who are exactly the same. I like the things that everybody likes, singing, playing the guitar, hanging out with my friends, but we rarely reflect on them as small privileges. Another thing about me is I'm very perseverant, my favorite phrase is "If you gave your best, then everything'll be fine"
Now is your turn to introduce yourself, see you in Boston!
José Pablo Rascón
I’m 21 years old currently in my 7th semester as a student of biotechnology engineering. Some of the things I like are: playing basketball, graphic design, science, playing soccer, camping, fishing, exercising and being around the people that I love. This is my second year as an iGEMer, and I’m grateful to be back, charged and reloaded!
Pablo Espinoza
Hello there! I´m a 20 years old retired boxer who had the chance to train in Julio César Chaves's gym but preferd to become an iGEMer. If i had to summarize this year in a phrase, I´d say no amount of boxing could've ever prepared me for this beating. I love tequila, videogames, science and beerponging myself to sleep.  I speak Spanish as my native language, English as my second and currently learning to speak Brazilian Portuguese “Ate Grand Jamboree”.
Sayuri Fabiola Sandoval
Hey! I'm 19 years old and I'm in my third semester of Biotechnology Engineering. I'm a country girl, I like to be in nature and enjoy the outdoors. I like to play volleyball, softball and swimming ... although I like more sleep and see memes. I love science, I love doing new things and have different experiences! I always like to brighten the lives of others, because thus we work and live better. iGEM ​​has given me unparalleled experiences, wonderful friends and a few large dark circles that make me look like a panda, but it's fine, I like it. This competition is a great opportunity for me and I'm sure that I will have great experiences participating in it.
Viana Isabel Pérez
Hi there! I'm 18 years old and currently coursing my third semester of Biotechnology Engineer. I'm passionate about science because it leaves me wondering about everything and I love it. What I enjoy the most is lab work and the smile of my boyfriend. An interesting fact is that I can fall asleep quickly anywhere, at any time and nothing wakes me up. My favorite part of the day is the sunset, it sounds cliche but seeing it fills my soul with joy and happiness. My aim is to make the best of every minute and live life to the fullest.
Zazil A. Solis Saldívar
Hi there! I’m 22 years old, making me the mummy of the group, haha I know I’m hilarious. I’m about to start the 7th semester of my career which is Biotechnology Engineering. I am excited to develop our bee project and beeing part of the iGEM community. I enjoy learning about other countries and traditions so that is why I was a Rotary Youth Exchange student in Brazil 5 years ago. I love traveling, Shakira’s old songs, rainy days and FOOD. My first laboratory experiment consisted in creating José Pablo Rascón Pérez a palm tree who makes photosynthesis.
