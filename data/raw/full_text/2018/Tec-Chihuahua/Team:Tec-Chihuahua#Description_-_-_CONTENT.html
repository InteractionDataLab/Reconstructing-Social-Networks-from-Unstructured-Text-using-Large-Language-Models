In the last two years, 53 countries suffered from these diseases, 6 of them are among the top 10 honey producers. The causal agents of these ailments are Gram-positive bacteria: <I>Paenibacillus larvae</I> and <I>Melissococcus plutonius</I> respectively. Nowadays, two techniques for the treatment of Foulbrood are used: antibiotics and incineration of hives. The former promotes the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria while the latter results unprofitable for beekeepers. Therefore, we propose the production of bee antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in <I>Escherichia coli</I> to treat <I>P. larvae</I> and <I>M. plutonius</I> infections. Defensin 1, abaecin, defensin 2, and apidaecin are each expressed in a different BL21 (DE3) culture. PelB leader peptide and a 6X His-tag foster adequate expression and further purification.

The adult bees expel the bacteria through the feces or from the food they provide to the larvae; <I>M. plutonius</I> enters the larva until it reaches the midgut where it reproduces exponentially.

Apidaecin appears to have no effect toward eukaryotic cells, and there is little to no bacterial resistance. The mechanism by which apidaecin kills bacteria starts with a non-specific binding of the peptide to an outer membrane component, which is a substantial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component. Apidaecin later invades the periplasmic space thanks to a specific receptor/docking molecule, which is a component of the transport system on the inner membrane. The peptide is then translocated into the interior of the cell.<SUP>24</SUP> It is transported through into the cytosol by SbmA.<SUP>25</SUP> Once the peptide is inside of the cell it has two possible targets: DnaK and the 70s ribosome. Apidaecin leads the protein synthesis inhibition by targeting the ribosome. However, it appears that the ultimate target is the DnaK, this is the major bacterial Hsp70 (70 kDa heat shock proteins). DnaK has several functions that end up inhibited by the peptide; the ATPase activity, which is involved in the initiation of DNA synthesis, and the refolding of misfolded proteins.<SUP>24</SUP> DnaK is also indispensable for the viability of the cell in stress conditions like heat shock at 42ºC.<SUP>26</SUP></P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="Defensins" class="tabcontent"><H3 align="center">Defensin 1 &amp; 2</H3><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">Defensins have selective activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
