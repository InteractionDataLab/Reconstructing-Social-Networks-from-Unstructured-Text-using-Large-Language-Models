During our time at iGEM, we seized this opportunity.

In an effort to contribute to the achievement of their goals, team Tec-Chihuahua characterized the PyeaR promoter (Part BBa_K381001: PyeaR-GFP composite) by proving its sensitivity to different concentrations of nitrates.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The collaboration developed as follows: On April 14th we established the first contact through a video call in which we shared our projects, troubleshot some of our problems, and shared some advice regarding raise funding and collaborations. On May 28th, we defined the objective of the collaboration.  On June 10th team Tec-Monterrey sent us the protocols to follow. Finally, from June 14th to June 25th, we performed the required protocols to get the results.

Thanks to the support between the teams we could achieve the construction of our BioBricks. Since the beginning, communication was fundamental. We shared our problems and searched for the best solution; working together contributed to the success of both teams. Basically, the problem appeared when we couldn't build our BioBrick because there were missing base pairs. TecCEM designed primers to add them to the prefix and suffix, thus amplifying the genes and allowing a correct digestion and ligation.
