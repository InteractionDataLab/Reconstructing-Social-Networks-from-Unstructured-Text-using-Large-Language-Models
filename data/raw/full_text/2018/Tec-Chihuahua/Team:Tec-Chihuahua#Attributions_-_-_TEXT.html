In our institution there isn’t a synthetic biology course, and the competition was our opportunity to immerse ourselves in this complex world; we started with the project brainstorming in February, working against Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius in mid-march and running protocols in the lab in June 10th. In our iGEM season, we were able to complete the InterLaboratory Measurement Study, build the composites [BBa_K2834005] , [BBa_K2834006] , [BBa_K2834003] and add them to the iGEM registry, collaborate with more than fifteen teams, achieve twelve contributions for Public Engagement, cooperate with international agencies and most of all, greatly live the iGEM experience. This wouldn't have been possible without all the persons and organizations that gave us their unconditional support throughout the development of the project. We really cherish all of this support; we are thankful because we learned hand-in-hand with many of them.
