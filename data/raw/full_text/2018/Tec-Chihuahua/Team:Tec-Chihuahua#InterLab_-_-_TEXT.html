All of the 2018 iGEM teams were invited to participate in the Fifth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology.  Team Tec-Chihuahua is excited about working on an international and collaborative experiment!
The protocols were actually very simple to understand and we didn't have any problems following them. Without a doubt, it was an enlightening experience full of challenges that helped us improve laboratory work during the development of the project. When we started working on it, a small problem appeared since we only had the Top10 strain at our disposal. But the New England Biolabs sponsorship arrived just in time with the DH5α strain, which allowed us to properly undertake all the protocols.
Due to the fact that we didn't have a microplate reader, taking part in the InterLab Study was the perfect opportunity to learn how to use one. The only drawback we had was getting the equipment to take the measurements but, in the end, the Research Center for Advanced Materials (CIMAV) lent us their laboratories. We are very proud because this year was the first time Tec-Chihuahua successfully participated in the InterLab Study.
The goal of the iGEM InterLab Study is to identify and correct the sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology measurements. In order to address this challenge, the iGEM committee provides researchers with detailed protocols and requires data analysis on the measurement of GFP. This year, the million dollar question is: Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD?
For more information, check out iGEM's official InterLab Study webpage . Below are the protocols we used and the data that we collected for the InterLab Study.
Calibration Measurements
OD600 Reference Point
The first calibration was to obtain a conversion factor to transform the absorbance data from the plate reader into a comparable OD600 measurement, using LUDOX CL-X as a single point reference.

Particle Standard Curve
In the second calibration was obtained a standard curve of particle concentration which was used to convert Abs 600 measurements to an estimated number of cells. It was measured a dilution of monodisperse silica microspheres.
