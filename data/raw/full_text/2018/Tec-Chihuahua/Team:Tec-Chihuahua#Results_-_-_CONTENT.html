Everything seemed correct in the transformation protocol, but once the DNA was visualized on an agarose gel our insert was missing and only pSB1C3 was evident. We then thought there was a problem during ligation. Therefore, we analyzed IDT’s synthesized sequence and identified that there were missing additional base pairs that flanked the restriction site so that the enzyme could properly cling and cut the sequence. This issue was troubleshot with the TecCEM iGEM team. They had the great idea to create primers that add six base pairs before the prefix and after the suffix thereupon amplifying the gene of interest. This collaboration was crucial for the construction of our BioBricks. <A href="//2018.igem.org/Team:Tec-Chihuahua/Collaborations#primers">Read the entire collaboration.</A></P></DIV><CENTER>Figure 1.

Its antimicrobial activity was evaluated against Gram-positive bacteria with antibiotic susceptibility testing by measuring OD<SUB>600</SUB> in broth.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">The three composites were synthesized by IDT® with the prefix and suffix flanking the region of interest. The final parts resulted in a sequence of 310 bp for apidaecin, 415 bp for defensin 1, and 361 bp for abaecin. Once the synthesis arrived, and the PCR was carried out, double digestion with EcoRI-HF and PstI restriction enzymes was made to each composite, and the chloramphenicol linearized plasmid backbone (pSB1C3) for following ligation of the backbone with each one of the fragments. This resulted in complete expression plasmids of 2337 bp for apidaecin, 2442 bp for defensin 1, and 2388 bp for abaecin. Afterward, <I>Escherichia coli</I> BL21(DE3) cultures were transformed by heat shock for following antibiotic selection of clones. Next step consisted of plasmid extraction and electrophoresis of the undigested plasmids, linearized plasmids with one enzyme, and double digested plasmids. Agarose gels allowed the confirmation of the correct plasmid constructions. </P></DIV><CENTER>Figure 2. (On the left) SnapGene® map of BBa__K2834003.

Since the T7 promoter regulates transcription of the construct, isopropyl β-D-1 thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is used as an inducer for T7 RNA polymerase production. The concentration of IPTG used was 0.5 mM. After induction, the cultures were incubated for six hours at 37 °C and 225 rpm. After that, protein extraction by lysis solution was made in order to obtain the soluble peptides. For insoluble peptides, the sample was treated with lysis solution + 6 M urea. </P></DIV><H2 align="center">Antimicrobial susceptibility testing</H2><DIV class="a"><P align="justify">In order to prove the antimicrobial activity of abaecin, apidaecin and defensin 1,  antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed for two different bacteria: <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> and <I>Streptococcus pyogenes</I>.<I>B. subtilis</I> was chosen because it is one of the best known Gram-positive microorganisms and <I>S. pyogenes</I> was chosen because it is one of the most important bacterial pathogens to humans. They both are widely known, commonly used, and thus allowed to better analyze the activity that the peptide has.</P></DIV><DIV class="a"><P align="justify"> 
Being unable to isolate our peptides by affinity tag purification due to lack of equipment, crude protein extract was used in the experiment. In order to validate the experiment, different concentrations of the peptides and several controls were used; 12 ml of LB broth, with a bactericide agent or a control, were inoculated with 100 μL of the overnight culture of each bacteria. Afterward, OD<SUB>600</SUB> was measured at 3, 6, 9, and 21 hours after inoculation.</P></DIV><H4 align="justify"><B>Defensin 1</B></H4><DIV class="a"><P align="justify"><I>B. subtilis</I> (figure 3a) was treated with 30.6 μg/mL (LC) and 153 μg/mL (HC) of total proteins of transformed <I>E. coli</I> BL21 (DE3) with defensin 1.

When they were disseminated in the LB medium with chloramphenicol, there was a presence of colonies which meant that they had been correctly transformed. However, when performing the electrophoresis of plasmid extraction only one band of the size of pSB1C3 was observed. First, we thought that the protocols of digestion and ligation that we carried out were not the correct ones or there was a bad manipulation. This idea was discarded when using a control with RFP. Doing more research, we discovered that the parts that we sent to synthesize in IDT lacked base pairs next to the restriction sites of EcoRI-HF and PstI. This means that the enzyme has no way to attach to the DNA sequence and digest it. Why did we have colonies that grew on LB + CAM? We believe that the re-circularization of the plasmid was possible.</P></LI></OL></DIV><H2 align="center">Future Plans</H2><P align="center">Eight months are not enough to address the full scope of our project.
