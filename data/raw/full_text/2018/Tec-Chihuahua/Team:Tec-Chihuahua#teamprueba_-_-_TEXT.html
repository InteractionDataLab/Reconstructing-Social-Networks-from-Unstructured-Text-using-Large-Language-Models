Our team consists of third, fifth, and seventh-semester Biotechnology Engineering students, all united for our great for learning, science, and technology, as well as by having a common goal, developing an amazing project!
César I. Rodríguez
Hey! I'm a 19-year-old Biotechnology Engineering student. Science has always been a part of me, as well as American Football, especially when Steelers play, and music, playing piano and guitar. One last thing I really like is learning new languages, currently German, and new accents. Let’s see how this goes, I’m thankful to be in and motivated to be part of a great project! #TeamCesar
Zazil A. Solís Saldívar
Hi there! I’m 22 years old, making me the mummy of the group, haha I know I’m hilarious. I’m about to start the 7th semester of my career which is Biotechnology Engineering. I am excited to develop our bee project and beeing part of the iGEM community. I enjoy learning about other countries and traditions so that is why I was a Rotary Youth Exchange student in Brazil 5 years ago. I love traveling, Shakira’s old songs, rainy days and FOOD. My first laboratory experiment consisted in creating José Pablo Rascón Pérez a palm tree who makes photosynthesis.
Pablo Espinoza Hernandez
Hello there! I’m a 19 years old biotechnology engineering student. I just finished the 2nd semester and I am excited for what is coming next. Curiosity has always been inside me and science is a great way to fulfill that hunger of me for new knowledge. I have a huge love for sci-fi, 90's Hip-Hop, Space science, SpaceX, traveling, new cultures, chemistry and I like to call myself a dreamer for a better tomorrow, I like to practice sports, such as box and Tae Kwon Do. I speak Spanish as my native language, English as my second an currently learning to speak Brazilian Portuguese “Ate Grand Jamboree”.

Twenty years of life have led me to study Biotechnological Engineering. Although I’d always rather stay home and play tabletop games on a rainy day, helping build a better world is the next best thing. #TeamCesar
Ana Laura Ortega
Hi! I’m eighteen years old and just about to start my third semester in Biotechnology Engineering. I have always loved nature and still get surprised every day with it; iGEM is a great opportunity to learn more about it. I love avocados, dancing and getting to know other countries and cultures, I really enjoy learning different languages. I’m glad to be part of this amazing team and wondering what this new experience will bring.

Alejandra Cervantes
Hi there! I’m 19 years old and I'm cursing my third semester of Biotechnology Engineering. With iGEM, I realized that I fell in love with science and also convinced myself that this is what I want to do the rest of my life. Besides science, I’m heavily addicted to cheese and also love swimming and making people smile. I’m currently learning German as my third language and also looking for learning even more.

Viana Isabel Pérez
Hi there! I'm 18 years old and currently coursing my third semester of Biotechnology Engineer. I'm passionate about science, it just leaves me wondering about everything and I love it. What I enjoy the most is lab work and the smile of my boyfriend. An interesting fact is that I can fall asleep quickly anywhere at any time and nothing wakes me up. My favorite part of the day is the sunset, it sounds cliche but seeing it fills my soul with joy and happiness. My aim is to make the best of every minute and live life to the fullest.
José Pablo Rascón Pérez
I’m 21 years old, currently in my 7th semester as a student of biotechnology engineering. Some of the things I like are: playing basketball, graphic design, science, playing soccer, camping, fishing, exercising and being around the people that I love. This is my second year as an iGEMer, and I’m grateful to be back, charged and reloaded!
Anna Aguilar
I am eighteen years old and just about to start my third semester in Biotechnology Engineering. I like to play volleyball, read and spend time with my siblings and parents. I enjoy learning new and diverse things, I think is one of the reasons why I am on an iGEM team. I like to be prepared and have the answer, if I do not have it, I dedicate myself to find it. I consider myself fortunate to have the opportunity to discover new paths alongside my friends (the guys on this page). I have plans for my future, even if they change, I am pleased with what I am doing now.
