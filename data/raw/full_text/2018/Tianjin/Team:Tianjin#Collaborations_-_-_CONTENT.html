               Responsibility comes with the ability. As main iGEM teams in Tianjin, we are entrusted with the duty of spreading our concept and advanced knowledge.
                
               With the same wish, we easily reached a consensus with <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:NKU_CHINA/Human_Practices">NKU-China</A> and <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Human_Practices">TUST-China</A>. We held several meetups to discuss the appropriate approach to advocating rational analysis and creative thoughts during the CCiC. Eventually, we decided to take the first step in high schools.
                
               We firstly listened to experts in education and contacted several high school in Tianjin. Teachers warmly welcome us to display and explain experiments for students. We hit it off with each other immediately. All three teams cooperated tightly, presenting a wonderful schedule containing: the concept of synthetic biology and its influence in reality, introduction of classic iGEM projects and example of our program, non-toxic yeasts which showed different beautiful colors. 
                
               To our great surprise, we received countless fans of synthetic biology and they showed great passion about the amazing field. They listened carefully and asked questions actively. The energetic and creative thoughts provided us valuable inspiration about our program. It was our pleasure to expose them to shallow biology research and we sent them the most sincere invitation to our next Open-up Day. 
                </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><DIV class="title title-normal"><P>Joint Report</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-lg-12 text"><P>
                   In our practice with people outside biology, we gradually found that production falls so far behind research that the public cannot understand its extraordinary meaning and scientists have difficulty in proving the value in their achievements. Hence, we initiated a joint research on how to apply a new technology to actual production.
                
                   In line with the principle of ‘To be more responsible and reflect more’, we jointly conducted a research on the transformation of biotechnology achievements with the iGEM team of Zhejiang University (<A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:ZJU-CHINA">ZJU-CHINA</A>), the University of National Defense Science and Technology (<A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:NUDT_CHINA">NUDT_CHINA</A>) and Ocean University of China (<A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:OUC_CHINA">OUC_CHINA</A>). Through the clear division of labor, we explored the general mode of the transformation in basic research results, and developed a series of HP activity guidelines and put them into practice by combining the features of iGEM competition and its own project features.

                   On September 16th, we are invited to Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance Establishing Conference &amp; Meet-up by <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:UCAS-China/Collaborations">UCAS-China</A>. We presented our projects and discussed the current and future collaboration between member teams of this brand new Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance. In addition, we communicated with teachers from the Institute of Biophysics. After, each team presented a small souvenir as the symbol of their team, put it into the collection case UCAS-China prepared for this conference.
 We hope the league would promote communication and cooperation between us.

                   We help they characterize the effectiveness of their first system, miniToe, proving that their system has the same trend under other experimental conditions. As the figure shows, the orange line refers to the system which is induced while the blue line is the control group, The big difference in expression level between two line indicate that the system is working well as a switch.
