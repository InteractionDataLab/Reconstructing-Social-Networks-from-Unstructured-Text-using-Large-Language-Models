In this part page, we uploaded most of the Biobricks involved in our project and optimized them to meet the requirements. This also includes the improvements we made to the previous part. You can find all the Biobricks you want to know about our project here. Better yet, you can use some of our Biobricks to build your own oscillator.
According to the requirements of the Bronze prize, we measured the experimental data of parts BBa_E2030 and BBa_E2060 , and you can see more details on part main pages.
