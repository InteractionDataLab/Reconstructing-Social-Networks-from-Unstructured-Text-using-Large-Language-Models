                    Circadian rhythm control over biological processes is pervasive among multicellular eukaryotes and cyanobacteria, suggesting a common evolved network motif and a strong evolutionary advantage for anticipating regular fluctuations in the environment. To uncover the mysteries of the biological evolution of the circadian rhythm system, our project combines non-circadian single-cell eukaryotic <EM>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</EM> with the circadian clock of autotrophic circadian cyanobacteria. According to the concept of “understanding by creating (creating is understanding)” in synthetic biology, a new biological clock system has been established in <EM>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</EM>, which has inspired a series of follow-up studies and novel applications of our project.

                        We successfully reconstructed the KaiABC circadian clock in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, predicting by modeling, regulating by expression control and characterizing its oscillation by yeast two-hybrid system. A bold attempt is made to explore how the oscillator can impact chromatin structure in yeast. These results demonstrate that the heterologous circadian oscillator is transplantable for metabolic pathway study as well as wide-ranging applications.

                       Although the project barely involves genetic pollution or the use of toxic reagents, our instructor still attaches great importance to the lab safety during the experiment. Before entering the lab, every operator must accept comprehensive training and have a deep understanding of equipment and reagents. All wastes are divided and gathered into special bottles, later get handled by professionals in a unified manner.

                       We made a survey about the circadian clock to investigate the potential impact to society and conducted follow-up market research on possible application. Furthermore, we were devoted to spreading iGEM idea to every age group. We made a picture book and performed a TV show for children, invited teenagers and parents to our lab and displayed biology to hundreds of tourists on the Begonia Festival. Synthetic biology can be a popular science by our actual action.

                        Twelve years have passed since Professor Yingjin Yuan worked with MIT and successfully promoted the iGEM in Asia. iGEM has been all the rage in Tianjin University. This year, a group of dynastic teenagers have gone through a series of tough tests and eventually set up a united family. The wonderful summer will be kept in everyone’s mind. Thanks for everyone who once reached out to us.

                        We attach great importance to the construction and appliance of BioBrick Part. We submitted a variety of parts centering on core KaiABC oscillator, from single genes to cassettes with fusion proteins in yeast two-hybrid system. Effective cassettes about reporter genes and downstream application were also constructed and submitted. Besides, we redesign previous Nanoluc to serve our project better.

                        The models include four parts. First, we established a fluorescent protein model using grayscale analysis to screen out the most suitable fluorescent proteins. Then, we drew the growth curve of yeasts and it fitted logistic model. It described the growth situation of the yeasts after plasmid introduction and it also offers the best measuring point and the best measuring interval. What’s more, we drew the degradation curve of the fluorescent protein, which helped us know different characteristics of the two chosen fluorescent proteins better. Finally, we constructed a model to illustrate the oscillation of KaiA, KaiB and KaiC protein called Mars Model, it also explained nicely the reason why the cycle reduced in yeasts.                     </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer" style="background-color: #79acdd;text-align: center;margin-top: 0;"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-3 footer-part"><P>
