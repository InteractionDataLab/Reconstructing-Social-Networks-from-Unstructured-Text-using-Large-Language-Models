High School Tours in Tianjin
Responsibility comes with the ability. As main iGEM teams in Tianjin, we are entrusted with the duty of spreading our concept and advanced knowledge.
With the same wish, we easily reached a consensus with NKU-China  and TUST-China . We held several meetups to discuss the appropriate approach to advocating rational analysis and creative thoughts during the CCiC. Eventually, we decided to take the first step in high schools.
We firstly listened to experts in education and contacted several high school in Tianjin. Teachers warmly welcome us to display and explain experiments for students. We hit it off with each other immediately. All three teams cooperated tightly, presenting a wonderful schedule containing: the concept of synthetic biology and its influence in reality, introduction of classic iGEM projects and example of our program, non-toxic yeasts which showed different beautiful colors.
To our great surprise, we received countless fans of synthetic biology and they showed great passion about the amazing field. They listened carefully and asked questions actively. The energetic and creative thoughts provided us valuable inspiration about our program. It was our pleasure to expose them to shallow biology research and we sent them the most sincere invitation to our next Open-up Day.
Joint Report
In our practice with people outside biology, we gradually found that production falls so far behind research that the public cannot understand its extraordinary meaning and scientists have difficulty in proving the value in their achievements. Hence, we initiated a joint research on how to apply a new technology to actual production.
In line with the principle of ‘To be more responsible and reflect more’, we jointly conducted a research on the transformation of biotechnology achievements with the iGEM team of Zhejiang University ( ZJU-CHINA ), the University of National Defense Science and Technology ( NUDT_CHINA ) and Ocean University of China ( OUC_CHINA ). Through the clear division of labor, we explored the general mode of the transformation in basic research results, and developed a series of HP activity guidelines and put them into practice by combining the features of iGEM competition and its own project features.

Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance Establishing Conference
On September 16th, we are invited to Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance Establishing Conference & Meet-up by UCAS-China . We presented our projects and discussed the current and future collaboration between member teams of this brand new Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance. In addition, we communicated with teachers from the Institute of Biophysics. After, each team presented a small souvenir as the symbol of their team, put it into the collection case UCAS-China prepared for this conference.
We hope the league would promote communication and cooperation between us.
With OUC
We help they characterize the effectiveness of their first system, miniToe, proving that their system has the same trend under other experimental conditions. As the figure shows, the orange line refers to the system which is induced while the blue line is the control group, The big difference in expression level between two line indicate that the system is working well as a switch.
Figure.1 Their minToe system worked well in our lab.
With XMU
With the same interest in KaiABC oscillator, we kept close contact with XMU at the very beginning. Apart from communication in design and modeling, we had shared our plasmids that respectively carried RpaA, SasA and CikA with them as soon as we heard their problem.
With TJU-China
We were glad to help them prepare the part backbone, pSB1C3 since they had too many biobricks to submit and the vector always run out.
They generously helped us measure the degradation of the origin with improved NanoLuc in 3 hours, proved our improved part could work effectively in Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741.
Figure.2 The part they characterized for us.
With HUST-China
We were glad to help HUST-China contact with experts they required. In the course of project researching, they read a paper from Tianjin University and sought assistance from us. Our teacher answered their questions about the paper and made some new suggestions. In late August, their team's student, Cheng Long, came to communicate with their iGEMers in 2015 about their project which was focus on Shewanella as well. Moreover, he visited our laboratory and power generation equipment. We hope it could bring them support more or less. had an opportunity to , visit their laboratory and power generation equipment.
They showed great interest in our picture book children, considering it a meaningful thought which could help children know more about synthetic biology. Thus, they made some creative advice about the stories to help us polish the writing.
