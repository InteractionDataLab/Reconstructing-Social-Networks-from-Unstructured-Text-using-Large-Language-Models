Education
Outside of our school, some of our team members attended local middle schools to teach the younger generation about the application of our project, synthetic biology, and iGEM in general. Members of the team gave presentations to students at four local grade schools: St. Peter's Catholic Elementary School, Ascension School, Dayton Regional STEM School, and and St. Helen Catholic School (the presentation can be found at the bottom of the page). The team also did hands-on activities with the kids to teach them about the structure of DNA. Not only did we teach the students, we also got a lot of helpful feedback from some of the teachers at these schools. Both the teachers and students also had many great questions, and those questions helped shape the way we think about our project.
