Biofilm Assay Testing With Cinnamaldehyde
Growing a Biofilm
Grow a culture of the wild-type Nissle overnight in a rich medium (i.e. LB)
Dilute the overnight culture 1:100 into fresh medium for biofilm assays.
Add 100 μL of the dilution per well in a 96 well dish.
Add cinnamaldehyde at different volumes to create the desired concentrations
Incubate the microtiter plate for 4-24 hrs at 37°C.
Staining the Biofilm
After incubation, dump out cells by turning the plate over and shaking out the liquid.
Gently submerge the plate in a small tub of water (i.e., use the bottoms of pipette tip boxes for P1000 pipetman as the tub). Shake out water. Repeat this process a two more  times. This step helps remove unattached cells and media components that can be stained in the next step, and significantly lowers background staining.
Add 125 μL of a 0.1% solution of crystal violet in water to each well of the microtiter plate. Wear gloves and a lab coat while making the solution. Use caution when weighing out the CV as the powder is hydroscopic and readily stains clothing, skin, etc.
Incubate the microtiter plate at room temperature for 10-15 min.
Rinse the plate 3-4 times with water by submerging in a tub of water as outlined above, shake out and blot vigorously on a stack of paper towels to rid the plate of all excess cells and dye.
Turn the microtiter plate upside down and dry for a few hours or overnight.
For qualitative assays, the wells can be photographed when dry.
Quantifying the Biofilm
Add 125 μL of 30% acetic acid in water to each well of the microtiter plate to solubilize the CV.
Incubate the microtiter plate at room temperature for 10-15 min.
Transfer 125 μL of the solubilized CV to a new flat bottomed microtiter dish.
Quantify absorbance in a plate reader at 550 nm using 30% acetic acid in water as the blank.
Procedure is a modified form of NCBI’s Microtiter Dish Biofilm Formation Assay (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3182663/)
