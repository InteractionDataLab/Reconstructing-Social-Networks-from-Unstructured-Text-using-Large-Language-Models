USAFA
The United States Air Force Academy iGEM team, USAFA , was very close with us this year and spent five weeks sharing a lab space with us. Along with helping them with lab work, we also helped them with their Interlab and bounced ideas we had off of them. Since they were a first-year team we mentored them helped them a lot with all of the new things that come with being a new iGEM team, such as their Wiki, safety forms, and what iGEM is all about. Having a new iGEM team right there to talk to was a great experience for both of the teams because we were able to present to each other, bounce ideas off one another, and learn about each others projects.

The Midwestern Meetup
Some of our team members attended the Midwestern Meetup to present our projects to four other teams across the Midwest: Michigan State , RHIT , Michigan , and UIOWA . We discussed the details, applications, and the many problems that the teams were facing at the time. We tried to help where we could when speaking with some of the other teams. We spoke with the Iowa iGEM team about using superfolder GFP to get a quicker response time for their GFP that will help their project.

RHIT
One of our team members went to Rose-Hulman, iGEM team RHIT and was shown around the lab and discussed some of the problems that were going with their project. They had also just finished the Interlab and some of the results were discussed then later compared with our data. During this time the RHIT iGEM team was making trading cards and they agreed to make one of our very own Mike the Microbe.

NUS-iGEM
We spoke with Russell and Marcus of the NUS-iGEM about how they modeled their project and some tips for modeling our own. They gave us some of their techniques for creating a model using experimental data and spoke about the applications about our project.

Mike the Microbe
We created a “Flat Stanley” called Mike the Microbe that we sent to the other iGEM teams as a social media outreach platform. We also created a friend for Mike called Chia the Chitinase. Chia has been released on the social media platforms and to other teams around the country.
