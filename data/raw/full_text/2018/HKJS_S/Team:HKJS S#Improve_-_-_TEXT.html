Improvement
Based on Harvard_BioDesign team in 2016
Similarities
Both our project has focus on PET decomposition. The coding sequence of PETase and MHETase from Ideonella Sakaiensis was transformed to e coli for faster expression.
Better utilisation of ethylene glycol
In the Harvard_BioDesign team’s design, the ethylene glycol is collected in a separate collection box. However, as ethylene glycol is a harmful substance [1] and can be utilised better. Hence, we propose using the ethylene glycol pathway in e coli [2]to further decompose ethylene glycol to carbon dioxide.
Different focus of plastic waste
Harvard_BioDesign team focused on plastic waste in the ocean while we wish to apply our design on an industry scale.
Based on SCU_China in 2015
Use of nif genes
SCU_China used nif genes for nitrogen fixation, while we amino acid substituted the nif genes to change the function of the genes.
Method of Gibson assembly
SCU_China wanted to do Gibson assembly in one go, but we made a large construct with separated steps.
