E coli growth curve
Throughout the project, we have observed that colonies with larger construct correctly transform into the e coli results in a slower growth. To investigate whether the growth of e coli in neb5-alpha will decrease due to the large plasmid contained, we hope to model the growth of different transformed e coli using different growth models and curve fitting methods. Unless specified, in all equations below, a is the upper limit of the growth curve, b and k sets the horizontal displacement and growth rate respectively.
Method
A single clone is picked from a perti dish, then incubated in 2 mL of LB with ampicillin for 16 hours, then diluted such that OD600 is 0.04-0.06. The cultures are then shaken at 250 r.m.p in 37 C. OD600 is taken at 15-minutes to 1-hour intervals. E coli with inserts of pET-Blue-2 (size: 3600 bp) and our construct FP 1.2.2 16 (size: 14471bp) are compared. Experiments are duplicated.
Assumptions
Assumptions
Justification
OD600 = 0.1 corresponds to 2*10^7 cells/mL.
It is taken for   convenience as calibration is very time consuming, and it is given by
[1]
.
s
The OD600 of   the overnight culture is the maximum OD600.
OD600 remains   constant staring from the stationary phase
[2]
and 16 hours of   incubation takes the e coli to stationary phase
[3]
.

Modelling
Gompertz function
Gompertz model is the most frequently used sigmoid model to fit growth data in biology
[4]
.
The form is given by

:
Logistic function
The Logistic function is proposed Pierre François Verhulst, which takes a common “S” shape.
The form is given by

Curve Fitting
Curve fitting is done by the curve fitting app in Matlab.

Conclusion
By comparing the growth rate of each model, we can see that a e coli containing a larger plasmid grows slower. Therefore, when overexpressing modified nif genes, it will take longer time to reach the designated phase compared to smaller constructs like PETase.
