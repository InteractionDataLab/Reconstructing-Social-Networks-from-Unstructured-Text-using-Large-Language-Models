Equation                             Chapter 1 Section 1Modelling
Our experiment creates a biological device for                             measuring Ni2+ concentration. Therefore, the main purpose of                             our modeling is to find the functional relationship between the ambient Ni2+ concentration (Nienvior.) and the luminescent intensity (LI) expressed by                             Lux. Firstly, we established a mathematical model to describe the dynamic process of the whole                             experiment, compared the predicted results with the experimental data, and adjusted the model with the                             experimental data to obtain the functional relationship between Nienvior. and LI.
Our model is divided into three parts. Firstly,                             NikABCDE is an ABC superfamily transport system, whose function is to transport Ni2+. Secondly, NcrB protein is the core regulatory                             system, which can bind with Ni2+ and then release the inhibition of                             promoter PncrA. Thirdly, as the inhibition of PncrA is released, the fluorescent protein gene of                             LuxCDABE connected downstream of PncrA can express and luminescence. Models are established for these                             three parts, and the effect of Nienvior. concentration on luminescent intensity is                             obtained.

NikABCDE Transports Ni2+
NikABCDE is an ABC superfamily transport system,                             and can transport Ni2+ for E.coli. Among them, two transmembrane                             proteins, NikB and NikC, constitute the transmembrane core of the transport system. NikA is the                             periplasmic binding protein (PBP), which can transfer captured nickel ions to the NikBC core, and NikD                             and NikE are two cytoplasmic proteins (De Pina, et al., 1995). Navarro, et al., 1993).
NikABCDE system for transporting Ni2 + process shows below
ke is the binding rate of nikABCDE and Ni2+ ,                             and the value of ke  is 0.1uM(Englert, 2010).
1. Assumption
        Ni2                             + diffusion equilibrium assumption
when Ni2                             + are transported into the cell, internal balance of Ni2+ concentration will be influenced, which can lead to uneven distribution of Ni2+concentration                             instantaneously. With a certain amount of time for the free diffusion, the Ni2+ concentration                             in the cell can be steady. So we assume that Ni2+ transported                             into the cell will have an uniform distribution instantaneously. And this assumption is completely true                             in the case of lower transport rate of the transporter protein.
2. Model
Reference diffusion balance model, establish ODE                             of Ni2 + diffusion model. From the law of mass action,                             the ODE between Ni and NiE is obtained

Regulation of PncrA Mediated by                             NcrB
When the bacteria were in a low-concentration Ni2+ environment, the repressor protein NcrB binds to promoter PncrA, making LuxCDABE downstream of PncrA                             unable to express. When bacteria are in a high concentration of Ni2+ environment, the intracellular Ni2+ concentration                             accumulates, NcrB binds to Ni2+, changes the conformational mode of NcrB, which                             falls off PncrA. The PncrA promoter is transcribed, and the LuxCDABE expression downstream of PncrA                             promoter emitted fluorescence. In this model, a kinetic model is established, and the functional                             relationship between Ni2+ concentration and Luminescent Intensity is                             deduced.
1. Assumption
        Assumption of NcrB
For NcrB, we make the assumption that there are                             three forms in the cells within the NCRB, respectively is free NCRB, NCRB - PncrA compounds, as well as                             the NCRB Ni2+ complexes. And in the process of inhibition of Ni2+ contact NcrB protein, which can be treated as                             competition between competition between Ni2 + and PncrA . In the process of competition, free NcrB can                             be regarded as an intermediate transition state. Specifically,  NcrB is detached from the promoter and                             becomes a free NcrB, which then binds to the Ni2+ to form a NcrB-Ni2+ complex, so the concentration of NcrB in the                             intermediate state can be seen as a constant.
        Transcription                             Assumption
1)                             The total transcription rate is mainly determined by the amount of substrate – NcrB dissociates with                             PncrA and the intensity of PncrA.
2)                             The promoter PncrA intensity (in polymerase per second) is a constant that represents the maximum                             expression rate of transcription.
3)                             The total transcription rate is the function of the maximum transcription rate and the fraction of the                             signal molecule bound to its binding site.
4)                             For constitutive expression of genes - NcrB, we can assume that it is the maximum transcript.
        Translation Assumption
1)                             The main factor influencing the translation rate is the rate of ribosomes                             across the mRNA, which can be approximated by constant rates.
2)                             The translation rate is limited by the amount of available mRNA transcripts that bind with ribosome.
3)                             The translation rate is a function of the ribosome velocity and the mRNA transcript concentration.
2. Model
Using the above parameters, we can construct a                             series of ODE representing our biosensor network.

is mRNA production rate from NcrB DNA, which                             values 0.0014nM·min-1(Junhua,                             2012).
is translation rate of NcrB mRNA, which values                             0.0093nM·min-1 (Pengfei, 2013).
3. Model Simplification
To simplify the calculation, ignore the parts                             that have little impact, and simplify the process as follows
k2 is the reaction rate constant for the binding of                             Ni2+ and NcrB, the value of k2 is 8nM (Xinming Yang. 2013).
It can be seen from the assumption that R is the                             intermediate constant value during the change process, and R0 is the total amount of intracellular                             NcrB, which is a function of copy number B of plasmid
(1.7)
Intracellular                             PncrA has two states, that is, binding to NcrB and free
(1.8)
The                             binding process of Ni2+ and R can be regarded as steady state                             equilibrium,
(1.9)
(1.10)
Luminescence Process of                             LuxCDABE
When Ni2+ is combined with NcrB, it can make promoter                             PncrA transcription, and then LuxCDABE expression and luminescence in the downstream. Luminescent                             intensity is related to the amount of LuxCDABE expression, and the amount of LuxCDABE expression is                             related to the amount of promoter PncrA transcription.
1. Assumption
        All of the detected promoter PncrA were                             produced by the unbinding of NcrB
        The luminescent intensity is positively                             correlated with the promoter concentration
2. Model
The                             luminescent intensity can be modelled as below:
(1.11)
Relationship between LI and t
The purpose of modeling is to obtain the                             relationship between Luminescent Intensity LI and Ni2+ concentration in vitro, solve (1.1)~(1.10), and                             substitute (1.11) to get the analytical solution of LI.
(1.12)
while
           (1.13)
to                             simplify the formula, we discuss it further
LI can't go up indefinitely, or Ni2+ can't                             go up indefinitely, so r1, r2 <0，γ>0. When the
,
(1.14)
It                             can be seen that when the external Ni2+ in vitro is a constant value, the final LI will                             tend to be a constant value
 Relationship between Ni2+ in vitro and LImax
From the derivation, the relationship between lg(Nienvior.)                             in vitro and LImax is linear. However, according to the experimental                             data, LImax shows a downward trend after reaching a certain                             concentration, and tends to 0 as the concentration increases. Therefore, we suspect that this is                             related to the cytotoxicity of Ni2+ and related experiments have been conducted.                             Through the experimental results, the modified model of LI and lg(Nienvior.)                             is established, and the original model was modified with this model. Compared with the experimental                             results, the model is in good agreement.
1.                             The linear correlation between LI and lg(Nienvior.)
When the external Ni2+ in vitro is a constant value, the final LI will                             tend to be a constant value. On this basis, we discuss how Nienvior is positively correlated with LImax.
When                             t→∞
(1.15)
while
(1.16)
according                             to mode，the                             relation between LImax and Nienvior. is  positive correlation.
We analyze the experimental data and find, within                             a certain range of Nienvior , concentration LImax and lg(Nienvior) are linear correlation.
2. Model Verification By                             Experiment
We                             make a line graph of experimental data as figure 4
We                             find that LImax and lg(Nienvior) tend to be a linear function with a positive                             correlation when lg(Nienvior) is in the range of (-∞，-3]. However, after the value of lg(Nienvior) is greater than -3, the value of LImax decreases significantly. Considering the influence of high concentration of nickel ions on                             cytotoxicity, the cytotoxicity of nickel ions is analyzed.
3. The                                 Cytotoxicity of Nickel Ions
Using the Logistic equation to fit the data
                      
We can get the following results:
Coefficients                             (with 95% confidence bounds):
                                   a = 1.086  (1.027, 1.146)
                                   b = 0.2424  (-0.4756, 0.9605)
                                   c =7.07  (1.872, 12.27)
Goodness of fit:
                              SSE: 0.005441
                              R-square: 0.9971
                              Adjusted R-square: 0.9957
                              RMSE: 0.03688
We                             can find that the adjusted R-square is close to 1, indicating the regression equation for fitting data                             is very appropriate. The figure of regression is as follows:
Figure 5 The                             Cytotoxicity of Nickel Ions
Based                             on the previous data and graphic, toxicity function can be established as
(1.17)
4. Modifying the Model
According                             to the above part, the model is modified as follows:
Considering                             cytotoxicity, the model is modified. LImax is modified to be
. With the Matlab, we get the revised relationship between LI                             and lg(Nienvior.)
Compare                             the revised model with the data.
According to the modified model, the relationship                             between LImax and lg(Nienvior) is predicted, as shown in figure 6. In the                             figure, the red dots represent the measurement data of the real experiment. It can be seen that our                             model has a good agreement with the experiment.
