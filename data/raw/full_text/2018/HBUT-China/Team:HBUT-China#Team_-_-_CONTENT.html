My usual research direction in the laboratory is artificial intelligence and big data analysis. I am very passionate about mathematical modeling, and have participated in many model competitions and research projects with good results. However, biodynamic modeling is still a challenge for me, yet also a rare modeling experience. Most importantly, I am very happy to become acquainted with so many lovely young ladies in my team.

For me, biological modeling is a completely unfamiliar field, so to understand the principles of the project and synthetic biology were not easy. In the process of modeling, we encountered many difficulties, such as the lack of literature. But I was also attracted by the logic of modeling, and awed by the field of biology field. Biology makes the world a better place, and we are the people who change the world.

When I first joined iGEM, I was just a new recruit full of hope for doing research. Because of this project, I starting going to the lab to learn how to mix mediums, how to transform, and how to culture bacteria. As a result of this process, I really felt myself grow and progress with the team. I am very grateful to the iGEM platform for helping me to get involved in scientific research, and understand it and learn to do it well
