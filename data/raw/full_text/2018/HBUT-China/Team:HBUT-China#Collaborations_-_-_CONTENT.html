                            Bioengineering uses stable, highly productive mutants, target strains, which contain foreign genes. However, screening these mutants costs vast time and workforce, and it is difficult to avoid using antibiotics. The  philosophy of BNU-China team is to use salicylic acid to induce glucose dehydrogenase expression to enhance the strain's pentose phosphate pathway, giving the strain a growth advantage. EmrR protein can inhibit the role of the downstream promoter P<SUB>emrR</SUB>, so that the gene downstream of P<SUB>emrR</SUB> can not be expressed, but salicylic acid (SA) can bind to emrR to eliminate this inhibition. BNU-China team sets the gene of P<SUB>emrR</SUB> downstream to gdh, using SA to control this route. After the BNU-China team replaced gdh with mCherry, we helped induce the expression of mCheery by SA, measured its fluorescence intensity to determine the optimal concentration induced by SA and the optimal induction time at the optimal concentration.

                            Ni<SUP>2+</SUP> is one of the heavy metal pollutants in our environment. In order to detect the concentration of the Ni<SUP>2+</SUP>, our team are going to use the NcrB protein operon to achieve this goal. In this system, the <I>nikABCDE</I> gene will express the NikABCDE protein, which belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter. It can transport Ni<SUP>2+</SUP> from the environment into the cell consuming ATP at the same time. And Ni<SUP>2+</SUP> is the signal we need to detect. At the same time the <I>ncrB</I> gene will express NcrB protein, which is a repressor combining with the pncrA promoter, inhibiting the expression of the downstream gene <I>luxCDABE</I>. However Ni<SUP>2+</SUP> will bind with the NcrB protein, causing the NcrB protein drop from the pncrA promoter. In this way, the <I>luxCDABE</I> gene will express. And the LuxCDABE protein can give out light by consuming energy in the cell. Thus we can detect the concentration of Ni<SUP>2+</SUP> by measuring the luminescence intensity.

                            1. The hypothesis on the diffusion equilibrium of Ni<SUP>2+</SUP></P><P style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
                            We assume that the ions distribute uniformly inside the cell immediately after they are transported into it through NikABCDE. As long as the speed of transportation is lower than the speed of diffusion, the ions are unlikely to aggregate around the transporter protein(e.g., NikABCDE). According to our knowledge, most of the transporter proteins do not possess such a high transporting efficiency, which means this hypothesis is valid in a larger degree.

                            2. The hypothesis on the relationship between NcrB concentration and the copy number of the recombinant vector
                        </P><P style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
                            Since each of the recombinant vector contains only one copy of the target gene, we can assume that the vectors have the same ability of expressing NcrB. Furthermore, it’s reasonable to assume that the final concentration of NcrB is proportional to the copy number of the recombinant vector. 
                        </P><P style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
                            3. The hypothesis on the concentration of NcrB during the process in which Ni and pncrA bind with NcrB competitively
                        </P><P style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
                            There are three subtypes of NcrB in the cell: the free state NcrB, the NcrB binding with pncrA and the NcrB binding with Ni<SUP>2+</SUP>. We assume that the concentration of total NcrB is not influenced by the expression of NcrB gene or its degradation process, because the speed of these two processes is relatively low compared with the competitively binding process. More importantly, based on this hypothesis, we can further assume that the concentration of free state NcrB remains constant during the process of competitive binding. This is because the kinetics feature of the process is similar to enzymatic reactions.

                            This system of equations is a set of first-order linear constant coefficient differential equations, and this system of equations has analytical solutions.

                            Since the concentration of the free state NcrB remains constant, and the concentration of total NcrB is a function of the copy number of the plasmid, we can present the following equations:
                        </P><P style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
                            Furthermore, we know that there is an equilibrium in the process of NcrB binding with Ni, which can be stated as follows:

                            As is proposed above, LI is linearly dependent on the number of free state promoter. That is to say,
                        </P><P style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
                            Substitute 2.4 into 2.5, we can get the following equation:
                        </P><P style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
                            Further substitute 2.6 into 1.4, now we have obtained the final expression of LI, in which time and the concentration of Ni2+ are the variables.

Our team was honored to be invited. More than 50 iGEM teams in China attend the meeting, and we had heated discussion about synthetic biology with each other. During the meeting, we demonstrated our project, from the design to the preliminary results. iGEMers from other teams put forward some constructive suggestions, and we also gained some collaborations opportunities from them. We were happy to make friends with some iGEMers and we stayed in contact with each other even after the meeting, which contributes to integrated collaboration. CCiC is really a big event for iGEMers in China. <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:HBUT-China/Human_Practices">see more</A></P><CENTER><H5>

                            In this year’s collaboration, the OUC-China team offered us a comic book about synthetic biology. The book exhibited the complex biology model and principle with funny comics, making it more easier for students to read and understand. So when we went to the Wuhan NO.20 high school classes to communicate with them, we brought the comic book with us, and hoped to bring the young students together to appreciate the fun of biological knowledge. Firstly we introduced in the form of comics, and brought them into the world of biology. We also used this comic book for attracting and recruiting new members for our next year’s competition.

                            During our voluntary project and introductory courses this comic book greatly assisted us to introduce synthetic biology to the public. In turn, we helped to make a detailed investigation and collect the reader’s opinions about this book, we really hope to make this comic book better to help more people appreciate the charm of synthetic biology.
