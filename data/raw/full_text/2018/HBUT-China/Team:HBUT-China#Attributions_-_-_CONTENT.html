                            The 2018 iGEM team project of Hubei University of Technology is mainly composed of experts in synthetic biology and molecular biology, who lead students from the schools of Biological Engineering and Food Science, Computer Science and Science. Our project is dependent upon everyone's efforts from the beginning to the end, and it aims to detect, measure and reduce nickel ion pollution in the environment. It builds on last year's project to create a more complete system.

We studied the literature related to the three processes and completed the establishment of the model with the help of the 2018 iGEM team BNU-China. The literature was searched to obtain the reaction constant K-value of each reaction. Finally, the obtained model was compared with the data to reflect the agreement between the theoretical results and the experimental results.
