Xiong Siyun
I’m Xiong Siyun, the captain of HBUT- China, I really enjoy the time we spend together preparing for the iGEM competition. As the leader of the team, I knew from the beginning that I must take most of the responsibilities. But I am very lucky to have awesome team members. They trust me and support me unconditionally. I sincerely hope our team performs well at the Jamboree.  Love you guys!
Rosie
I am Rosie, a senior student specializing in food science. For this year's event I am mainly responsible for visas and some coordination work, participating in the HP activities, and the wiki. In my daily life I usually like to learn PS, PR. Learning to make videos is my hobby. Although my English abilities are humble, I hope you would communicate with me. I love JJ Lin's songs, and also love going shopping and enjoying anime. That’s all.
Liu Kai
I’m Liu Kai, the leader of the experimental group and a lively and outgoing boy. To the best of my abilities, I routinely plan daily experiments, and try to arrange the work in an orderly manner. I love study, though sometimes I played basketball when I am free. My dream is to use biotechnology to create happiness for human beings.
Lin Weichao
I am Lin Weichao, a lively and funny boy. I am one of the leaders of the experimental group. iGEM is more of a challenge and exercise for me, and it gave me the opportunity to think independently and work collaboratively with others. I hope that throughout this competition I will have a more rigorous attitude towards experimental research, and seize this opportunity to further learn and pursue the best in myself.
Angelina
I’m Angelina and I’m in the experiment group. I used to be very careless when doing experiments and made many mistakes. But practice does make perfect, after doing the steps over and over again, I found I could be better at it, and I felt proud of myself. I feel it’s really worthwhile to participate in this competition, from which not only do I now know how to solve all kinds of problems, but also how to work together to make things better. I am honored to be part of the team!
Wu Zidan
My name is Wu Zidan. I am a member of the experimental group. I participated in the rather laborious but joyful experiment process from design projects to building plasmids and measurement data. The iGEM competition is a wonderful addition to my college career. I really enjoyed the feelings this experience gave me, working with a group of enthusiastic and determined people fighting for a goal.
Yaoling Li
My name is Yaoling Li, a member of the experimental group in the team. I am glad to join in the competition with my team members, and I am working hard to become a better person. During this period of time, I changed from only being able to prepare the medium in the laboratory, to being able to do many experiments independently. Many thanks to my team for all their the help during this period. The harder you work, the luckier you are.
Tong Xinyu
My name is Tong Xinyu, and I was mainly responsible for the experimental part of the team.When you join iGEM, you feel like you are raising children together, and you are faced with various unexpected experimental situations and brainstorming every day. For me, joining iGem has been a life-changing experience; working with like-minded people, exploring bioengineering and research, and discovering if this is what I want to pursue after college.
Wang Yunyi
My name is Wang Yunyi, and I am the Interlab leader. During this project, I encountered some unexpected problems, but our teacher taught me that when it comes to problems, it is more important to focus on solving it, not complain or lay blame about it. I have learned a lot in these months, not only in terms of knowledge, but also in understanding the true meaning of  “team”. I am really honored to be one its members.
Xinyi Hu
My name is Xinyi Hu, and I am a member of InterLab group. Through doing the experiments for InterLab, I’ve learned many details about culturing bacteria, which gives me a forward-looking view of postgraduate experiments. Thanks to the iGEM competition, I’ve met lots of reliable teammates, from who I not only learned a lot, but also experienced cooperation in a team.
Hu Zike
Hello everyone, my name is Hu Zike, and I am the head of the modeling group. I am a junior in the School of Computer Science. My usual research direction in the laboratory is artificial intelligence and big data analysis. I am very passionate about mathematical modeling, and have participated in many model competitions and research projects with good results. However, biodynamic modeling is still a challenge for me, yet also a rare modeling experience. Most importantly, I am very happy to become acquainted with so many lovely young ladies in my team.
Jiang Wenran
My name is Jiang Wenran, a member of the modeling group. For me, biological modeling is a completely unfamiliar field, so to understand the principles of the project and synthetic biology were not easy. In the process of modeling, we encountered many difficulties, such as the lack of literature. But I was also attracted by the logic of modeling, and awed by the field of biology field. Biology makes the world a better place, and we are the people who change the world.
Li Qianxin
My name is Li Qianxin. I work as the group leader of Human Practice. I organized group activities and also made contact with other organizations. I also helped with some basic experiments. What I’ve learned during the competition was that the team should be united. Without unity, we are weak. Through the competition, I became more proactive, open-minded, gained good communication skills and developed a team collaboration personality.
Li Weiwei
I’m Li Weiwei. I am a member of HP. In daily life, I am a lively and cheerful girl, I always have a lot of inspiration, also bringing a lot of fun to the team and good ideas to HP. When doing experiments, I am bold but careful. In the team, I’m friendly to everyone but I always pursue perfection, demanding it of myself and others. And most importantly, I am crazy for biology！！！
Yang Haojing
My name is Yang Haojing, the team's website developer. I am good at web front-end development, love programming and developing useful and sophisticated applications, and I'm also an amateur radio operator. It’s a great pleasure and honor to show my front-end design ideas and front-end design language to iGEM wiki developers around the world through the iGEM wiki of our team that I developed. I had a very enjoyable time with the team members. I also hope our team does well at the Jamboree.
Emmy.
My name is Emmy. As a team member I mainly focus on graphic design, including banners, logos, posters, illustrating pictures, and souvenirs. I think it is an important part of a project. I want to show you the advantages of our machine, and I also want to tell you what we did and how we got it after hard work over the past few months. To be a designer is a fresh, as well as an interesting experience for me. I'm so glad I joined this team, and participated in iGEM.
Zhang Hanhan
Hello everyone, I am Zhang Hanhan, a member of the experimental team of the HBUT-China. When I first joined iGEM, I was just a new recruit full of hope for doing research. Because of this project, I starting going to the lab to learn how to mix mediums, how to transform, and how to culture bacteria. As a result of this process, I really felt myself grow and progress with the team. I am very grateful to the iGEM platform for helping me to get involved in scientific research, and understand it and learn to do it well
