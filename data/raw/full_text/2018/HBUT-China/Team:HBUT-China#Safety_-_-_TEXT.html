Overview
This year, team HBUT-China build up a system in E. coli which can detect nickel ions in the environment, using the methods of synthetic biology. Even if the chassis organism we used were barely E. coli DH5alpha, which are classified into Risk Group 1, it was also necessary for our team members who were in charge of the wet-lab experiments to receive lab safety training. Our PI, Dr.Dai Jun and Dr.Liu Zhijie, who are experienced and scrupulous, offered us training on experimental skills and lab safety. Here we want to share our experiences on lab safety control.
1. General Safety Training
Before we started our experiments, all of our team members responsible for the wet-lab experiments received detailed and rigid training on biosafety and lab safety from Dai and Liu. The training included standard experimental procedures, usage of biosafety cabinets and normative disposal of experimental waste etc. During the first few weeks since we started our experiments, Dr.Liu stayed with us all the way in the lab to supervise our manipulations. He gave us guidance and enlightened us when necessary. During our time in lab, we kept thorough lab records, including protocols, consideration on error-prone steps and careful discussions etc. None of us conducted experiments on our own until it could pass a check on lab safety and experimental operations.
2. Chassis Organism Safety
The chassis organisms used in our project is E. coli DH5alpha, which is classified into Risk Group 1 and Safety Level 1. Because of this, It does not cause disease in healthy adult humans and is allowed to be operated in open bench. Our genetically modified bacteria were cautiously operated and discarded and surly not released to the natural environment to prevent interference to the natural environment.
3. Experiment Safety
In order to minimize potentially risks that could be brought about by certain instruments and reagents, our members were requested to use normative protective equipment and follow the safety manuals throughout our lab time. Instruments like alcohol burner and centrifugal machine were carefully used according to the safety manuals. Gloves, lab coats, pants and close-toed shoes are demanded during lab time, and it is not allowed to touch about when wearing gloves. Besides, no food or drink is allowed in the working space.
