Overview
Experiments
1. Designed a set of highly sensitive nickel ion detection systems and construct a genetic loop to express it in the large intestine, resulting in Nickel Hunter 2.0
2. The bio-luminescent gene luxCDABE is better than the fluorescence gene; it avoids the interference from E. coli DH5α's self-produced fluorescence, and the LuxCDABE luminescence response sensitivity is greater, which is more conducive to detection and accuracy.
3. Compared with the wild type, the E. coli with the gene nikABCDE introduced increases the absorption of nickel ions by 40%, and the detection accuracy is also improved.
4. Prepared to build a system for real-time monitoring of nickel ions using the principle of photoelectric conversion, and display these results on a mobile APP.
5. Submitted the functionally tested bio brick.
Human Practices
1. Established the iGEM club in the school，introduced the synthetic biology knowledge to students and explained our projects through the club cultural activities; conducted lectures in our school.
2. Participated in the school science and technology festival，introduced synthetic biology there，shared iGEM knowledge and our project to the people.
3. Collaborated with a high school, and used OUC-China’s comics to bring them a unique interactive class, and invited their students go to our lab to study and exchange during their free time.
4. Participated in CCiC, learned about many good HP projects from other excellent universities, discovered many problems with our own project, and helped our team make progress. Here, we received a lot of inspiration, improved our work, and also cooperated with other universities.
5. Conducted an online survey to discover people's understanding of water pollution issues and synthetic biology.
6. Designed a research questionnaire in cooperation with HBUT Dandelion Volunteer Service Team to investigate the lakes’ protection and management in Wuhan in general.
Future Plan
1. Reproduce all of the experiments that we have done this summer to make sure the results are credible.
2. Realize the real-time monitoring system, moving from idea to reality, to achieve a more convenient nickel ion detection system.
3. Add an absorption system based on the detection system.  We envisage the absorption of nickel ions by the isolation of the vacuole of S. cerevisiae.  We found two nickel ion channel proteins present in high-nickel-resistant plants called TjZNT1 and TgMTP1t2, expressed on cell membrane and tonoplast. We want to achieve the purpose of absorption by letting these two proteins be expressed on the cell membrane and tonoplast of S. cerevisiae cells, and then gradually transport nickel ions into the vacuole.
