The 2018 iGEM team project of Hubei University of Technology is mainly composed of experts in synthetic biology and molecular biology, who lead students from the schools of Biological Engineering and Food Science, Computer Science and Science. Our project is dependent upon everyone's efforts from the beginning to the end, and it aims to detect, measure and reduce nickel ion pollution in the environment. It builds on last year's project to create a more complete system.
On this page you can find everyone who contributed to the project.
We would like to thank all of the consultants who have assisted us throughout this project. We would also like to thank all the other people  who helped us in many ways with this project, whether it was to provide us with valuable advice, DNA, bacterial strains, and other valuable suggestions. These contributions helped us enormously.
Primary PI
Jingfeng Tang : Ph.D. researcher in molecular biology, assisting us in designing DNA fragments, providing guidance on our experimental techniques, and providing follow-up guidance.
Secondary PI
Jun Dai: Bioengineering researcher, supervising our laboratory technology and helping us to finish the project. Guide our competition recommendations.
Zhijie Liu: Synthetic biology expert, providing us with laboratory guidance to ensure that our experimental design can be carried out safely and smoothly.
Instructors
Dan Churchman: Oral Lessons, helping us complete English speeches, PPTs, presentation coach.
Han Chen: Assisting us in the oral guidance of the competition and helping us to arrange for the competition routine in Boston.
Zhengyang Chen: The captain of the 2017 iGEM team HBUT-China, who provided constructive guidance to help us successfully complete the competition.
Student Leaders
Siyun Xiong: Capitain of 2018 iGEM team HBUT-China, organized weekly meetings, tracked the progress of the competition, was the principal in external communication, arranged work of each member, and reminded all parties of completion time for the work .
Zhuyu Han: Helped to take charge of human practices, establish our team Wiki, and assist team members to apply for visas.
Student Members
Kai Liu: One head of the experimental team, helped to complete the formulation of the preliminary experimental protocols, the construction of the plasmid, and the determination of the microbiological experimental data.
Weichao Lin: Another head of the experimental team, helped to complete the development of the pre-test protocols, determination of the protein expression part, and assisted in arranging the team video and some external communication.
Yuanlin Liu : Member of the experimental group, responsible for plasmid construction, microbiological experimental data measurement, and communication with our foreign teachers.
Zidan Wu: Member of the experimental group, helped with plasmid construction, microbial experimental determination, communication with foreign teachers, and also participated in the design of team poster.
Yaoling Li: Member of the experimental group, responsible for constructing the plasmid, assisting in the determination of the standard curve, and determining the microbiological experimental data.
Xinyu Tong: Member of the experimental group, responsible for constructing plasmids and assisting in the determination of microbiological data.
Yunyi Wang: The person in charge of interlab, completed the data measurements of this part. Assist in the construction of plasmids, and microbiological experimental data determination.
Xinyi Hu: Member of Interlab, also assisted in the completion of plasmid construction, and microbiological experimental data measurement.
Zike Hu ,Wenran Jiang: The people in charge of modeling, used biochemical knowledge to establish the dynamic equations involved in the project. Our model was divided into three processes: NikABCDE transport nickel ions, NcrB-mediated pncrA de-inhibition, and LuxCDABE bioluminescent reaction. We studied the literature related to the three processes and completed the establishment of the model with the help of the 2018 iGEM team BNU-China. The literature was searched to obtain the reaction constant K-value of each reaction. Finally, the obtained model was compared with the data to reflect the agreement between the theoretical results and the experimental results.
Qianxin Li, Weiwei Li: The people in charge of Human Practices, conducted a large number of questionnaire surveys on the Internet to understand the local population's awareness of synthetic biology and water pollution, also carried out project publicity at Wuhan No. 20 Middle School, and thanked them for their support. We are also grateful to the team of Dandelion Volunteers from Hubei University of Technology for working with Wuhan Lake Protection and Research.
Haojing Yang: The people in charge of our team Wiki, helped establish the basic structure of it, and designed the layout of each module to make our project more attractive.
Wenqiong Zhang: Designed our team poster and team banner, also made some illustrations about our project.
Laboratory Reagent Support: Thanks to Nanjing Nuoweizan Biotechnology Company for supporting our laboratory equipment and office equipment. Thanks to Genescript for supporting our experiments.
Team training and project opening: Our team used the book, Introduction To Synthetic Biology published by Tianjin University. After learning the basic theoretical knowledge, we began to consult a large amount of literature to develop our project plan. From January to May, our project was basically finalized, and our project ran from July until October.
