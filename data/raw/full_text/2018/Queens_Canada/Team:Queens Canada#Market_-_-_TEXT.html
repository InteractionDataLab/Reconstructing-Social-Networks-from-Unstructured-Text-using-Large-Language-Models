Market Direction Analysis
Following our interview series, we reflected on all the insight we had gained from the various experts, parents, and community members. We came to the conclusion, that the use of the diagnostic pacifier device, was perhaps not best fit in the hands of all parents, because they may lack the scientific literacy to properly interpret fluctuations in their child's hormone levels. Additionally we received specific feedback on our pacifiers design and implemented the experts advice into our next iteration of the design seen here.
Ultimately, we weighed impact and feasibility in our design and proposed the following strategy for our device, detailed in the graphic below. Most immediately, the technology we worked on developing this year could be best utilized by researchers for the immediate quantification of hormones in samples, following appropriate testing and clinical trials this device could benefit researchers as a non-invasive method of measuring salivary analytes. After the product has gained validation by clinicans, we would hope that the device could be used for non-verbally expressive individuals, such as those suffering from neurodevelopmental disorders to gauge well-being. Additionally, this device may have application in those suffering from neurodegenerative disease as a tool to gauge their well-being. Lastly, if the device is approved for such an indication, it may benefit wider audiences to track hormone levels and gain greater visibility to their endocrine health.
Market Direction Analysis Summary
Use by parents to monitor child’s stress levels and general well-being
Pros
Can remove any communication barriers between parent and child
Ability to measure Δ cortisol could be useful in evaluating changes over time
Useful in the early detection of illness and prevention of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)
Cons
Continual monitoring may lead to more anxiety in parents
Expensive technology
Difficulties in establishing a baseline
Knowing the information does not have a substantial effect; minimal chance for intervention
Used as a diagnostic tool in clinical settings
Pros
Non-invasive procedure
Instant results could facilitate faster diagnosis leading to earlier intervention
Could aid in current diagnostic test of endocrine disorders, The Dexamethasone Suppression test, for
Could help reduce extensive wait times in clinics or Emergency Room (ER)
Little training required to operate.
Cons
Concerns about biomarkers in saliva being as accurate as plasma samples
Sensitivity and specificity must be very high for proper diagnosis
Use in monitoring treatment in clinical settings
Pros
Non-invasive method Instant and ongoing surveillance
Could be used to evaluate metabolism of hormone
Help to determine personalised treatment plan and dosage
Could be useful in determining effectiveness of a treatment
Cons
Concerns about biomarkers in saliva being as accurate as plasma samples
Expensive to replace cartridges
Used in research studies to monitor levels of specific biomarker(s) in saliva
Pros
Could replace disruptive method of salivary collection
Could reveal critical information missed in current studies
Easier to complete studies with young children and infants
Cons
Would need different designs that don’t interrupt the studies and are less noticeable
Would need different designs to use in studies with people of all ages
Must be incredibly sensitive and specific for the desired biomarker
