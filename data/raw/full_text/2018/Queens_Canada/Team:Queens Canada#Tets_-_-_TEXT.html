Interview Summaries:
 
Potential   Application
Feedback
Pacifier   for the general public (parental use)
●     Used by parents to monitor   child’s stress levels when away
●     Issues pertaining to what the   end result is; what does knowing this information   mean? Intervention?
●     Could Δcortisol be indicative of   something?
●     Creating a problem that doesn’t   exist
●     Establishing what is a normal   cortisol level and what should be a cause of concern is difficult
○     Individuals often have different   baselines; would need to incorporate this into app
●     May be more stress-inducing in   the parents
●     Parents already have intuition   and ability to communicate with their children through other means (no need   to replace this with technology)
●     As long as proper safety testing   is deployed, “engineered protein” shouldn’t be a huge concern
●     May be helpful in preventing   Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)
●     Expensive
Pacifier   for the general public (parental use)
●     Used by parents to detect if   child is awake/asleep
●     Other technologies already exist
●     May not be the fastest method to determine if infant is awake
●     May be useful to know child’s breathing rate and temperature while   they’re asleep
Quantitative self care
●     Would need to change design from pacifier to something less visible
●     Similar idea to fitbits, etc.
●     Growing market
●     What would be the relevance of knowing changes in cortisol?
●     Don’t want people to confuse healthy cortisol changes with abnormal   fluctuations/indicators of disease
●     Expensive
Monitoring   device for non-verbal individuals (i.e. developmental disabilities)
●     Used to communicate stress and   discomfort
●     Its use may be refused due to sensory sensitivity
●     Texture, taste, odour is very important
●     Must be incredibly durable, not a choking hazard (single piece not   multi-components)
●     Better suited to be used as a diagnostic tool when something is   believed to be wrong than just an everyday surveillance system
●     Financial barriers → who will be able to afford this product (will it be covered by   insurance?)
●     Can’t use pacifier design, need a more age appropriate design
Research   settings
●     i.e. salivary cortisol levels   during psychology studies (refer to Harkness’ studies)
●     Salivary cortisol levels in   different settings to gauge stress in the NICU
●     Could replace disruptive method   of salivary collection and eliminate steps involved with sending sample off
●     More efficient
●     Could reveal critical   information missed in current studies
●     Easier to complete studies with   young children and infants
●     Since cortisol is such a   sensitive biomarker that can fluctuate rapidly, it is important that the   method used to collect the sample (i.e. needle) does not induce a change
●     Must be a very accurate test   (sensitivity and specificity important)
Clinical   applications
●     Used for diagnostic purposes
○     Adrenal insufficiencies
●     Communication of patient pain in   non-verbal individuals (i.e. in neonates)
●     Non-invasive methods would be   key for NICU and other infant applications
●     Could be used to complement   sucrose as an analgesic (help to determine when to re-apply)
●     Concerns about biomarkers in   saliva being as accurate as plasma samples
●     How reliable are the results in   determining diagnosis (sensitivity/specificity)
Clinical   application #2
●     Used to monitor effects of   hormonal replacement therapy
●     Used to determine progress and   dosages (i.e. Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome)
●     Non-invasive method
●     Could be used to evaluate   metabolism of hormone
●     Could make calls about changing   dosage, etc.
●     Could help to determine how   effective a treatment plan is in an individual
