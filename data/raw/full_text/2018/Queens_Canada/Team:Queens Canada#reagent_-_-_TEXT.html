Renilla Luciferase Reagent
Introduction
Renilla Luciferase assay reagent (substrate and buffer) can be prepared ahead of time. It is stable for 12 hours at room temperature. If necessary, it can be stored at -20°C for 2 weeks or at -70°C for up to 1 month. It may be thawed at room temperature up to five times without appreciable activity loss.
Materials
luminometer
siliconized polypropylene tube or small glass vial
Renilla Luciferase Substrate
Renilla Luciferase Assay Buffer - promega
Renilla Luciferase Assay Lysis Buffer is supplied as a 5X concentrate. Prepare a sufficient quantity of the 1X working solution by adding 1 volume of 5X Renilla Luciferase Lysis Buffer to 4 volumes of distilled water and mixing well. However, promega recommends that Lysis Buffer be prepared in the amount needed just before each experiment. Store the 5X Renilla Luciferase Assay Lysis Buffer at -20°C.
Procedure
Add 10µl of 100X Renilla Luciferase Assay Substrate to 1mL of Renilla Luciferase Assay Buffer contained in either a glass vial or silicolinzed polypropene tube. This will prepare sufficient Renilla Luciferase Assay reagent to perform 10 assays.
