See more information here.
Sequences have been ordered as gblocks. Will be ordering kanamycin resistance construct for the estrogen receptor as a positive control,  one with the glucocorticoid receptor, and three different versions of the same construct with linkers of varying length and flexibility  between the LBD and the intein.
Week 4 (May 22-25): Prepared media and ampicillin plates, obtained our plasmid, practiced transformation, liquid  culture preparation, plate streaking, and miniprep techniques.
Week 5 (May 28-June 1):
Used electroporation to transform pET16b within our host E. coli strain, DH5-alpha
10 µL and 100 µL of the bacteria was plated on ampicillin plates and stored at 37°C overnight
Prepared liquid cultures using four random colonies from the ampicillin plates
Performed a plasmid MiniPrep to isolate plasmid DNA. Concentrations were determined using UV spectrophotometry
Performed a diagnostic restriction digest using HindIII and AvaI and ran on agarose using gel electrophoresis
Following confirmation of successful transformation, bacterial glycerol stocks were prepared (stored at -80°C)
Week 6 (June 4-8):
Made chemocompetent cells of DH5-alpha and BL21
Resuspended gblock-NanoLuc-gblock DNA
Linearized our plasmid with BamHI and XhoI
Performed Gibson Assembly on the linearized plasmid and the gblock NanoLuc, as well as performed a          negative control of Gibson Assembly® Master Mix by substituting DNA with water
Used electroporation in 3 DH5-alpha samples (Gibson Assembly® Master Mix, diluted Gibson Assembly®          Master Mix, and control mix)
10 µL and 100 µL of each sample were plated on ampicillin plates and colony growth was observed where expected
Week 7 (June 11-15):
Prepared 4-hydroxytamoxifen + kanamycin plates and cortisol + kanamycin plates
Used a restriction digest to test the NanoLuc Gibson Assembly product
Results were inconclusive → gel was run at too high of a voltage
Chloramphenicol plates were made for Interlab Measurement Study while waiting for DNA sequences to arrive
Learned how to perform luciferase assays
Week 8 (June 18-22):
Started the week with InterLab Measurement study:
Made standard curves for fluorescein, microsphere particles, and LUDOX CL-X using a plate reader
Attempted the cell measurement protocol:
Started by making 40 chloramphenicol plates. Then heat-shock-transformed DH5-alpha with the plasmid, then plated
Transformed nanoluc containing pNL1.1 plasmid into DH5-alpha using chemical transformation
Grew a liquid culture Thursday night of DH5-alpha housing pNL1.1, and another liquid culture of DH5a with pET16b
Performed plasmid mini-prep (extracted the plasmid DNA) and did a double digest of each KpnI and EcoRI for pNL1.1, XhoI and HindIII for pET16b
Performed Gibson Assembly to insert an Anderson Promoter into pNL1.1 for the luciferase assays
Performed another Gibson assembly to insert 2 overlapping fragments into pET16b:
N-terminal of KanR
N-intein-LBD (GR)-C-intein-KanR
Did electroporation to transform E. coli and plated
The Gibson Assembly for pNL1.1 didn’t work (currently still promoterless)
Nothing grew (including on the positive control) → therefore, could be a plasmid, transformation, or Gibson assembly                          problem
Week 9 (June 25-29):
Gibson was redone with a HiFi Gibson Assembly on pNL 1.1 and the Anderson promoter, as well as pET16b and intein with three different          linkers (GPGGSG, GPGGSGS, GGGGSGGGGS), and a positive control
Did chemical transformation using New England Biolabs supplies and plated on ampicillin plates
Colonies were recovered on every plate (including the positive control)
Now have colonies for pNL1.1 +Anderson promoter and for the three different sequences with KanR+intein+linkers+GR domain
Made liquid cultures
Performed a diagnostic digest on three linkers using BsaI
One of three pET16b digestions was as expected with linker 1 came out perfectly as expected on the gel
Performed a luciferase assay on pNL1.1:
Pelleted 1-2 mL of liquid culture bacteria (pNL1.1). Repeated (four different liquid cultures).
Added 1 mL of lysis buffer (contains: lysozyme, β-mercaptoethanol, phosphate buffered saline (PBS)).
Let sit for 30 min.
Sonicated the mix for 11 seconds, then put on ice. Repeated twice.
Pelleted cellular debris by centrifuging, and collected the supernatant (contains the protein).
Ran a serial dilution in a white 96-well plate (1×, 0.5×, 0.25×, 0.125×).
Repeated for four rows of different liquid cultures. Added one extra for a negative control.
Luciferase assay confirmed production of NanoLuc was occuring
Plated liquid cultures on kanamycin and kanamycin + cortisol plates
No growth
June 29th: First SynBio Meeting
Week 10 (July 3-6):
Tuesday: Prepared plates with ampicillin and cortisol to test if the cortisol was the reason the bacteria wasn’t growing
Made new SOC media, which will be used in future transformations
Plated linkers and pNL1.1 from the bacterial stocks for further cortisol and splicing testing
Wednesday: Made liquid cultures of the plates
Thursday: Plated all of the liquid cultures on kanamycin plates with varying concentrations of cortisol (10nM, 1 µM, 10µM, 100µM)
Also plated on ampicillin and cortisol plates with a concentration of 10 µM (and on kanamycin as a control)
Friday: Results → There were no colonies on any of the plates with cortisol and kanamycin. As well, pNL1.1 grew on the ampicillin          and cortisol plates, confirming that cortisol is not killing the bacteria.
Week 11 (July 9-13):
Grew up liquid cultures of our plates (from bacterial stock) to check for potential contamination
Performed a plasmid MiniPrep and diagnostic digest
No contamination of pNL1.1 or pET16b linkers was seen
Sent DNA on Wednesday for sequencing (the GR, intein, linkers ×3)
Did Gibson on GFP-intein-GR content, but the pET16b was not as clear in our gel as we would have liked
Made more cortisol, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and kanamycin plates for further tests when DNA arrives
Ordered Nanoluc containing sequence from Pnl1.1 with biobrick prefix,suffix and illegal restriction sites removed
Week 12 (July 9-13):
Performed Gibson Assembly this week for our part, and also now have assembled the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with NanoLuc          and without intein, estrogen receptor, and retinoic acid receptor with a kanamycin resistance (saw growth on these plates as          well, and made stocks)
Ordered primers, dNTPs, and manganese chloride for use in error-prone PCR
Completed the InterLab Measurement Study this week
Gibson Assembly of Nanoluc Coding Device, into DH5a
Week 13 (July 23-27):
Calibrated Luminometer with Nanoluc Coding device. Used serial dilutions of NanoLuc containing solution, found decreasing readings with luminometer corresponding to the relative decrease
July 25th: Second SynBio Club Meeting
July 26th: Science Quest Mentorship
Week 14 (July 30-August 3):
grew  up  more  pET16b  and  linearized  it  (digested)  for  Gibson  assembly
Made  liquid  cultures  of  4HT  Kan,  and  Ampicillin  stocks  and  plates.
Transformation of 3-2ER intein into BL21. Selected colonies, performed mini-preps with isopropanol to remove DNA-ase.   Gel confirmed succesful transformation
Assembled  a  FRET  biosensor using  acGFP and  mCherry, then expressed  it  in  BL21  DE3, tested  it in a  fluorometer and found some  promising results. For  example, we had fluoresce of 8 billion  AU in some wells, compared to  700 million in the LB controls
Week 15 (August 7-10):
GFP Autosplicing Intein construct did not work. Confirmed extensively with LB controls.
FRET based biosensor might be working, on fluorometer there was huge increases of MCherry emission compared to LB controls, when excited at 475nm (acGFP excitation)
Composite  BioBrick  consisting  of:a  Anderson  Promoter  -  Ribosome  Binding  Site  -  NanoLuc®  -  Terminator works! consistent Nanoluc production. Characterized time course kientics
First attempt at error-prone PCR unsuccessful, positive control did work. Suspect primers are too long. Ran a gradient still no result. Tm suspected to be too high. Will redesign
Week 16 (August 13-17):
FRET  biosensor  works!    Tested  on  a  fluoremeter  and  found  150×  increase  over  a  water  control,  then  he  went, then  to  the  Biomedical  confocal  imaging  Laboratory  at  Queen’s  and  found  that  the  antagonist  reduced  the  FRET  interaction.  (A.K.A.,  this  proves  that  the  biosensor  works!)
ER intein tested in BL21 on 4-HT plates, still no results, even with good controls. Was concerned the ethanol which the 4-HT is dissolved in might be killing the bacteria but its not the case
Digested FRET, confirmed insert size with gel
Week 17 (July 30-August 3):
Took  another  visit  to  the  biomedical  imaging  laboratory  this  week  to  take  quantitative  images  of  the  FRET  biosensor.  He  took  photos  of  the  FRET  biosensor  under  cortisol,  mifepristone,  and  ethanol  (control)  conditions  (while  keeping  the  magnification,  excitation,  and  filtration  constant).  Now will  begin  analyzing  the  relative  intensity  of  GFP  and  mCherry  fluorescence  in  each  image  to  assess  the  amount  of  FRET  occurring.
Tested  the  ER  intein  being  expressed  in  BL21,  by  inducing  expression  with  IPTG and  incubating  for  4  hours  at  37°C,  then  added  4-HT,  incubated  for  1  more  hour,  then  plated  200  μL  on  plates  containing  10  μM  4-HT  and  kanamycin,  and  another  on  kanamycin  alone. No growth
oGrew  up  10  mL  of  BL21  expressing  the  same  intein  construct,  then  induced  expression,  and  4  hours  later  separated  the  10  mL  into  5  mL  with  4-HT,  and  5  mL  without.  Then  lysed  the  cells  and  collected  the  cell  lysate,  the  soluble  fraction,  and  the  cell  debris  portion.  These  were  then  mixed  with  50  μL  of  Coomassie  blue  (dye  for  Western  blotting)  and  frozen  it  down
We  also  attempted  Error  Prone  PCR  on  the  intein  this  week,  however  it  wasn't  successful
Week 18 (August 6-10):
Ran  an  SDS  for  the  protein  fractions  from  last  week•It  showed  that  the  intein  is  being  made  (large  band  at  77  kDa)!    But,  it’s  insoluble,  which Dr. Petkovich suspected  and  explains  why  there  was  no  splicing  producing  kanamycin  resistance
Week 19 (August 20- 24):
No lab work
Attended Queen's in the park event to recruit students
Week 20 (August 27- 31):
No work done this week, wiki infrastructure in place.
Week 21 (September 3rd - 7th):
Attempted to Clone FRET and ER-Intein into pSB1C3 from gel extracted EcoRI and PstI. T4 ligation at 30 mins room temp, then 30 mins in fridge. Chemical transformation, but no prepared SOC so used LB. No colonies grew
Ran a gel on the Ligation products, looked positive, there was band forming around 5kb, indicative of succesful ligaton, but transformation didnt work
Presented at Engineering Design Fair
Week 22 (September 10th - 14th):
No Updated
Week 23 (September 17th - 21st):
Cloning FRET and Intein re attempted with NEB 5-alpha compotent cells, no success!!
We want to clone the intein cause although it didnt work, it improves characterization of a previous part. I.e The intein being tested in bacteria instead of yeast.
Week 24 (September 24th - 28st):
Growing up liquid culture of Nanoluc coding device/Pnl1.1 with illegal cut sites removed.
Liquid culture, mini prep, ran gel. Confirmed insert is present.
Week 25 (Oct 1st - 5th):
No luck with cloning. Even tried using very new T4 ligase. Gel extracted pSB1C3 from mRFP, and used linearized pSB1C3 provided by igem then PCR clean up.
Week 26 (Oct 8th - 12th):
NanoLuc coding device added to registry, then sent to igem on DNA submission Deadline
Added FRET and ER- Intein too because they are good chracterizations of parts, even if we couldn't clone them into pSB1C3
