She prefers experimenting on new ideas instead of learning them from powerpoint   slides, and she thought QGEM would be a good place to be doing that! Her primary   interest is microbiology, specifically bacteria and viruses. When Janis is not organizing   her notes and setting up tasks for the team, she can be found taking care of the 43   plants in her house and rewatching Marvel movies.
Ruben Warkentin (Outreach Volunteer)
Ruben is in his third year of Biochemistry and is returning for his second year with the   QGEM team. He has been interested in all things molecular biology, ever since he   learned that mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell – QGEM was a good   opportunity to expand on that knowledge. With his sriracha shirt, he continues to bring   fresh style and ideas to the QGEM Outreach team. If Ruben is not talking about   synthetic/molecular biology, he can be found running western blots.
Sara Stickley (Outreach Volunteer)
Sara is in her fourth year of Life Sciences and is returning for her second year with the   QGEM team. Ever since first learning about synthetic biology she has been eager and   excited to get involved and learn more about the fast-paced, innovative field! When not   working hard with the outreach team this summer, you can find Sara trying to master the   ukulele and spending time under the sun. Sara hopes to pursue a masters degree in   genetics or biochemistry and can’t wait to work with the QGEM team for another   summer.
Declan Rowett (Wiki Volunteer)
Declan is in his third year of Computer Engineering. He was a dry-lab volunteer last   summer and is excited to improve upon some of his newly acquired skills assisting in   the dry-lab again. While not studying anything remotely similar to the biological   processes encountered in QGEM, he is interested in expanding his mental horizons and   working with people with different passions to his own. Once sufficient knowledge is   accumulated, he shall begin his takeover of the research industry with self-improving AI   that will solve all of the world's problems, and *never* cause a robot uprising, or so he   says.
