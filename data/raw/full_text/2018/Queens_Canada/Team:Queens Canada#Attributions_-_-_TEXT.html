Attributions
We would like to thank all of our excellent mentors who advised on this project, or taught us essential laboratory skills. All experimentation was ultimately performed by the student members of the team.
Project Advisors
Dr. John Allingham, Principal Investigator, Associate Professor, Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences, Queen’s University
As our principal investigator and advisor for QGEM 2018, Dr. Allingham was a crucial figure in the organization of the team. He acted as a  consultant for experiments, allocation of resources, and guided our project with his expertise.
Dr. Martin Petkovich, Secondary Principal Investigator, Queen’s University, Professor  Cancer Research Institute
Dr. Martin Petkovich has supported our team every step of the way by offering lab space, equipment, reagents, training, and expertise on everything  from steroid hormone receptor structure, to project applications.
Patrick Diep, iGEM Team Mentor, M.Sc. Candidate in Chemical Engineering, University of Toronto,
As a University of Waterloo iGEM team alumnus, and previous iGEM judge, the team is very fortunate to have the support of Patrick, who we were introduced to through the iGEM Mentorship program. Patrick has been a great help in keeping the team organized, and ensuring our efforts fulfill medal criteria.
Dry Lab
Dr. Robert Campbell, Assistant Professor, Queen’s University
Provided assistance and guidance to the modeling group, offering his expertise and experience in utilizing molecular simulations to inform our  projects design.
Dragos Chiriac, MSc. Candidate, Ross Laboratory, QGEM alumnus
Dragos drew upon his years of QGEM experience to help us with construct design, modelling, brainstorming, and troubleshooting.
Wet Lab
Dr. Virginia Walker, Professor of Molecular Genetics, Queen’s University
Dr. Walker has provided us with lab space and advised us in experimental procedures of protein purification and daily lab work.
Dr. Donald Cameron, Post-Doc, Petkovich Lab
Taught the wet lab molecular biology techniques, offering his expertise in cloning, transformation, and general advice every step of  the way. He also helped us interpret unexpected results and solve any problems we encountered.
Ms. Kristy Moniz, Lab Technician, Walker Laboratory
Assisted in teaching the team about general laboratory procedures, as well as cloning troubleshooting.
Mr. Byron Hunter, MSc. Candidate, Allingham Laboratory
Assisted in teaching the team about general laboratory procedures, protein expression, gibson assembly, and PyMol modelling.
Ms. Irsa Shoukat, PhD Candidate, Allingham Laboratory
Assisted with transformation, error-prone PCR protocols, and Interlab Measurement Study troubleshooting.
Dr. Daria Trofimova Senior Research Associate and Lab Manager, Allingham Laboratory
Assisted in teaching the team about general laboratory procedures, as well as cloning troubleshooting.
Interviews
We would like to thank all interviewees for taking the time to learn about our project and sharing their knowledge and experiences in research.  We received valuable advice for the potential directions of the project’s technology.
