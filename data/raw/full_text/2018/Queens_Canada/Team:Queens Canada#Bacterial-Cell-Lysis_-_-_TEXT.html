Bacterial Cell Lysis
Introduction
Materials
Resuspension buffer
20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6)
2 M Urea
Procedure
Harvest cells at 5 000 rpm for 20 minutes.
Resuspend pellets in 25 mL of resuspension buffer.
Sonicate to lyse cells.
Sonicated pellets shoud be centrifuged at 12000 g for 20 min.
After removing supernatant, pellets should be resuspended.
Sonicate cells in 20 mL of Resuspension buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 6M urea).
Repeat twice.
Keep supernatant after final centrifugation .
Final supernatant was mixed with Ni-NTA agarose pre-equilibrated with resuspension buffer 2.
Incubated for 1 hr at 4C.
Pour entire mixture into column and initial flow through was collected for further analysis.
Wash column with 5mL of wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 6 M Urea, 20 mM imidazole) three times.
Elute protein of interest with 1.5 mL of elution buffer (20 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 6 M Urea, 0.3 M imidazole).
Elution fraction was dialyzed against 1L of Dialysis Buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mM EDTA) at 4C overnight.
