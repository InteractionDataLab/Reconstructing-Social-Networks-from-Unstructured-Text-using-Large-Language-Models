Cell Lysates from E. Coli
Introduction
Get started by giving your protocol a name and editing this introduction.
Materials
50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5
50-200 mM NaCl
5% glycerol (v/v)
1 mM DTT
1 mM PMSF
Procedure
Resuspend the cells in chilled lysis buffer in a ratio of 1 g cell wet weight to 1 mL lysis buffer.
Add the PMSF at this point
Add 5 uL MgCl2 (1M) and 1 uL DNase solution (1 mg/mL) per mL of cell suspension and incubate the solution at 4C for 30 min.
Remove cell debris by ultracentrifugation at 4C for 30 min at 45 000 rpm.
