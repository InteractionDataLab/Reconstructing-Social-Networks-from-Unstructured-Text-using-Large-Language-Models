Our research into data visualization, which emerged from our reflexivity process, shows the importance of interactivity. It serves to engage the audience, and improve their understanding of our project. We believe that abstract concepts, such as the function and co-operation of microbes, can be better understood through interactive representations, hence the idea of creating a game. If you have done so yet, please download it from the Google Play Store or the Apple Store!


When we were developing <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College/Engagement#Game">our game</A>, we used <B>Bloom’s taxonomy to develop the objectives.</B> This takes the form of a hierarchical framework  which we have used in other parts of our project (Armstrong, 2013).  Learning at the higher levels is dependent on having developed knowledge at lower levels (Shabatura, 2015). The summarized hierarchy we used from bottom to top was: </P><OL style="font-size:16px;"><LI>Knowledge - Recognition of terms and ideas.</LI><LI>Application - Apply abstractions to specific concrete situations.</LI><LI>Synthesis - Creative construction of novel ideas from multiple sources of information (Armstrong, 2013).</LI></OL><P>
We wanted people who played our game, <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College/Engagement#Game">Go Culture</A>, to be able to: </P><OL style="font-size:16px;"><LI>Recognize what co-cultures are and how they can be beneficial.</LI><LI>Explain where they occur in nature and how they can be useful to people.</LI><LI>Produce their own ideas for novel applications of co-cultures.</LI></OL></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-lg-10 text-justify col-centered"><P>
Based on the responses we received from participants in our game, we believe Go Culture succeeded in achieving our educational goals. <B> 80% of people who played were able to recognise and explain co-cultures.</B>  Moreover,<B> they were able to create amazingly novel applications</B> which we had previously not considered like managing obesity through the regulation of the gut microbiome.

Over 100 people at the <A href="https://live.newscientist.com/">New Scientist Live Event,</A> and an additional 15 students from the City of London High School contributed to the testing of our game.  <B>We had over 20 hours of contact time with players, and collected detailed survey responses from everyone.</B>
In the future, we would like to increase the amount of guidance the game provides its players.  For example we would like to improve the instructions for how to mix microbes to make novel applications on our mixing platform in the game.  We would also like to include a short tutorial video at the beginning of the game.  Furthermore, we would like to expand the number of microbes and products available in the game. </P></DIV></SECTION><DIV class="bg-danger"><SECTION id="Game"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="col-lg-6"><SPECIALH3 style=" color: #FFFFFF;"> Go Culture Game </SPECIALH3><P style=" color: #FFFFFF;">Most people have a negative view of bacteria and microbes in general. We wanted to show that many different microbes exist and that most of them are very useful to humans. Since our project focuses on co-cultures and microbial consortiums we also showed that these are very common and explain some processes in which they are employed. We created a video game in order to present and inform the public on the points above in a fun and interactive way.

The aim of the game is to collect different types of microbes and co-culture them to obtain all the products available in the game. The microbes are found at the end of platform levels in specific environments such as the Gut or the Ocean. The lab environment is where the player can, using a mixing platform, mix the microbes together and create products such as yogurt and glow-in-the-dark cellulose.

The products were inspired by current products created using microbial consortiums or synthetic biology, previous iGEM projects and some were invented to trigger the player's imagination. Most players, when interviewed, were able to create new products by using the ones they created in the game as inspiration.
