Dr. Andrea Guerin is a full time Assistant Professor in Pediatrics and Medical Geneticist. She is the Year 2 Director at Queen’s University Medical School. Her work 
    in Medical Genetics includes a consultation practice consisting of general genetics, prenatal genetics, cancer genetics and the care of patients with inborn errors 
    of metabolism. Interviewing Dr. Guerin was a great opportunity to hear her thoughts on the pros, cons, and potential applications of using cortisol as a useful 
    biomarker, including revelations on hypoglycemia, insulinemia, and early diagnosis of developmental disabilities. In terms of the pacifier model, she suggested 
    potential use of a saliva collection device, which would work well as a non-invasive method of collecting DNA from infants to do genetic testing. As well, Dr. Guerin 
    found value in the modular design of our ligand detection system and offered the potential of looking at glucose and bilirubin as other relevant metabolites in the 
    pediatric field.

She conducts research that primarily focuses on 
    the correlation between stress and depression in adults and adolescents. Her studies focus on the effects of early childhood trauma on sensitizing the biological 
    and psychological stress response in a manner that makes people more susceptible to psychopathology. She examines the changes in cortisol levels in response to 
    stressors, and she pointed out several major factors that would contribute to the varying levels of cortisol in individuals raised in diverse settings. She suggested 
    that our application should include a function to determine one’s personal cortisol baseline throughout different times of the day in order to give more meaning to 
    the collected data. She believes our biosensor would be applicable to her line of research as it is a more time-efficient and non-disruptive method of monitoring 
    cortisol levels in psychological studies.

Dr. Menard provided our 
    team with lots of feedback on our project design and raised potential concerns that we must be aware of when designing our biosensor technology and the associated 
    smartphone technology. She discussed the hyporesponsive stress period that occurs during the first year of one’s life, which provided an emphasis on the need to be 
    able to effectively measure and determine a cortisol baseline for the app to work accurately for each user. She also discussed some of the concerns she had with the 
    use of a genetically engineered protein being incorporated into the device. The appropriate safety testing and educational information must be readily accessible to 
    all potential consumers to avoid any health and safety concerns. Our interview with Dr. Menard was very insightful and highlighted areas that our technology may be 
    most useful for, with an emphasis on research and clinical settings. She believes the scientific community could benefit greatly from a cortisol-reading device that 
    is fast, affordable and exceeds the accuracy of current devices on the market.

    was able to provide our team with extensive background knowledge on different metabolic disorders associated with adrenal insufficiency, as well as the current 
    diagnostic procedures and treatments involved with these disorders. Based on personal experiences from Dr. Saleh’s line of work, he sees the need for non-invasive 
    diagnostic systems for hormone-related disorders. As well, he suggested the use of our biosensor technology for use in monitoring the efficacy of various treatments, 
    and to better track how the therapies or supplements are metabolized in an individual. Dr. Saleh was also able to provide our team with valuable information about 
    the Ontario Newborn Screening process, and the endocrine-related disorders that are currently tested for -- offering insight into a potential future role for our 
    technology as a less invasive screening method for newborns with metabolic disorders.

She serves on both 
    the Canadian Neonatal Network and Evidence Based Practice for Improving Quality (EPIQ) Steering Committees and is a member of the Board of Directors for the 
    Canadian Pediatric Society. During our interview with Dr. Dow, we were able to gain valuable knowledge about daily procedures and processes that take place in 
    Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). By evaluating current practices involved in the maintenance of neonate well-being and pain-mitigation during different 
    procedures, we were able to better understand how our project design could be implemented and beneficial in this setting. One of the specific applications that 
    were elaborated on during our time with Dr. Dow was the use of our technology to aid in Newborn Abstinence Syndrome treatment plans and morphine dosage 
    determination. The other application we discussed was the possibility of aiding with the use of sucrose as an analgesic for neonates, and determining the efficacy 
    of this pain-reducing method that is currently employed. By creating a device that can quantify cortisol, stress and pain affecting non-verbal individuals can be 
    better understood and managed to prevent detrimental developmental effects.

She is the parent of two children and would do anything to better understand what is causing stress in her children. The normal process would be to watch children very carefully and make connections to try to determine root cause of stress. Although she sees a benefit to anything that would improve the well-being and happiness of her children, she has concerns about what the cortisol information really means. Such as if there is a need to determine the cortisol change, or is it just a normal process? Could a device like this make parents less aware of their natural intuition? Overall, she expressed a general worry that the information may just make parents worry even more. However, she thought it would be better suited for diagnostic/management/screening scenarios with specific conditions or in specific situation such as in use when the parent is unable to figure out what is causing the distress in the child. We then spoke about the conversations we had have endocrinologists, and psychologists. She agreed that this device is better suited in the hands of a trained professional (doctor) opposed to parents that may misinterpret information. She stated her sentiment as follows “Parents of young children are vulnerable. They always want to do their best. We need to be careful what we offer them. We don’t want them making links that don’t exist.”

    provided a lot of insight into what research is required to validate our biosensor technology and demonstrate its effectiveness and clinical utility. She provided 
    information pertaining to important parameters that must be evaluated when working with biomarkers, including analytic and clinical specificity and sensitivity 
    values, negative and positive predictive values, the concentration range our technology can measure, the saturation point of our assay and cross-reactivity that

    product as a form of stress communication with non-verbal individuals. Ms. Penni Lochnan and Ms. Paula Ball were able to provide us with valuable feedback on the 
    potential application of our technology that we were evaluating. They discussed the usefulness of cortisol as a biomarker in determining situations that provoke 
    stress in the individual, as well as its use as an early indicator of illness. Some concerns that they had were related to the physical design of the pacifier 
    surrounding sensory sensitivity and the possible refusal of use due to these issues. This has prompted us to be very thoughtful with which pacifier designs are 
    used, and important considerations surrounding the taste, texture and durability of the product. They were also concerned about who would have access to the 
    information, and wanted to ensure their privacy would be protected. This conversation enlightened us on the importance of considering the needs of those we would 
    be helping, and ensuring the utility would be beneficial with no malintent.
