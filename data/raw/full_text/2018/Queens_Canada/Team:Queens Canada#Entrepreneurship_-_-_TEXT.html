Entrepreneurship
This year QGEM was fortunate to be a part of the Queen’s Innovation Centre Summer Initiative Program (QICSI), which is a 17-week program hosted by the Dunin-Deshpande Queen’s Innovation Centre. This summer internship program provides teams of Queen’s students from all different fields with a diverse range of resources and entrepreneurial training to pursue their own startup companies. Through this opportunity, the QGEM team was able to participate in the QICSI Bootcamp, which consisted of a two-week intensive segment with full time classes taught by Commerce and Engineering professors, seasoned entrepreneurs, and business experts to provide the necessary knowledge and training to start our own business.
