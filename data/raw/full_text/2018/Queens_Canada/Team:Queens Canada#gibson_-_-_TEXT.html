gBlock Gibson Assembly
Introduction
The Gibson Assembly Method described by Gibson is a rapid assembly method that provides directional cloning of multiple DNA fragments in a single reaction, without the need for specific restriction sequences. It relies on use of an enzyme mixture consisting of a mesophilic exonuclease, a thermophilic ligase, and a high-fidelity polymerase. For the assembly reaction, the gBlocks Gene Fragments and the vector insertion site are designed with overlapping sequences at the locations that are to be joined. At 50˚C, the exonuclease digests dsDNA from the 5’ ends, but is rapidly degraded leaving complementary, 3’ ssDNA ends. The resulting single-stranded, complementary ends are then availible to hybridize to each other, at which point the polymerase fills in missing nucleotides and the ligase covalently joins the fragments together.
Materials
gBlocks Gene Fragments (with 20-80 bases of sequence overlaps)
Linearized plasmid
Gibson Assembly Master Mix (neb)
Cell transformation reagents
Procedure
IDT
Two or more gBlocks Gene Fragments are designed with 20-80 base overlapes with the adjacent gBlocks fragment sequences and the linearized plasmid. The plasmid can be linearized by restriction digest or PCR.
Linearized plasmid and fragments are combined in a tube with Gibson Assembly Master Mix.
Incubate at 50C for 1 hr.
The resulting completed plasmid is ready for transformation into the bacteria, and sequencing. Note: IDT scientists recommend sequencing at least 2X the number of gBlocks Gene Fragments assembled. For example, if you assembled 2 fragments, you would sequence four clones.
