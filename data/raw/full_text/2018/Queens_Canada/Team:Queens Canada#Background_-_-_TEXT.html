Background
Biosensors
Biosensors are devices that are able to detect the presence of analytes and effectively  convert this biological response to an electrical signal. This system consists of three components: a bioreceptor, transducer and detector. The  bioreceptor is able to form substrate-specific interactions with the analyte. The transducer is then able to detect the substrate-receptor  interaction and transmit this into an electrical signal, which is amplified and processed by the detector. This information is then capable of  being sent to a data storage device for quantification and analytical purposes.
Ligand Binding Domain
Nuclear receptors are a family of evolutionarily conserved proteins that functions as a  ligand-dependent transcription factor [1]. After binding certain ligands, the receptor undergoes a conformational change which activates them,  and allows them to bind directly to DNA to alter gene transcription [1]. Circulating steroid hormones, like cortisol, are able to activate the  receptor and mediate processes such as stress response, energy metabolism and immune responses [2]. The ligand binding domain of nuclear  receptors generally consists of eleven alpha-helices and two beta-sheets that enable the formation of a three-layered protein structure [2].  There also exists a regulatory C-terminal helix, titled "helix 12”, that is essential for hormone binding. There are conserved residues within  these helices which form critical interactions with the ligand allowing for specificity within the interaction [2].
The above image demonstrates the generic structure of the apo-LBD (unbound) and holo-LBD (Ligand bound) conformations of a nuclear  receptor. Large structural homology in nuclear receptors allows for the potential ability to modularly exchange the ligand binding domain of our  biosensor in order to measure a vast array of different analytes. Both of the detection methods we have developed utilize conformational changes  in the nuclear receptor ligand binding domain to produce a measurable signal.
Approaches
Starting with the natural Ligand Binding Domain of nuclear receptors as our means of binding to ligands, we took two approaches to producing a  measurable signal from this interaction.
