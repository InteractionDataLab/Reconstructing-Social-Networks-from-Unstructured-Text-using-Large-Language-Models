Resuspension of gBlocks Gene Fragment
Introduction
gBlocks Gene Fragments ordered in tubes are provided dry and must be resuspended.
Materials
TE
Molecular Grade water
Procedure
IDT recommendations
Before opening the tube, spin it down in a microcentrifuge for 3-5 seconds at a minimum of 3000 x g to ensure the DNA is in the bottom of the tube. The pellet can become statically charged and, without this step, can either fly out of the tube or remain in the cap, resulting iin loss of yield.
Add molecular grade water, or TE, to reach a final concentration of 10 ng/µL. (<1 ng/µL results in a loss of material due to adherence to the plastic tube in the absence of a carrier such as tRNA).
Vortex briefly.
Incubate at approximately 50°C for 15-20 min. Heating the tube will ensure the solvent comes in contact with the tiny pellet, even if it is stuck to the side of the tube. Thus, this step will increase the likelihood that the entire pellet will be resuspended.
Briefly vortex and centrifuge.
Verify the final concentration
