Our team started from May 2018, which is quite late compared to other teams. We were inspired by the previous iGEM teams from HAFS, though our institution does not teach any iGEM or synthetic biology course. We started brainstorming in May and started in the lab from July. After spending one month for learning necessary techniques and conducting interlab study, we started on oour project from August.
