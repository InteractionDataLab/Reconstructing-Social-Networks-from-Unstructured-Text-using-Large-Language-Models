About Us
 Ten students from Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies (HAFS, in short) have came together to complete a wonderful project for iGEM 2018!
   Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies has traditionally (though a considerably short tradition of 4 years) participated to iGEM competitions. Kyuhee Jo, the team leader, has participated in last years iGEM as part of the last year's HAFS iGEM team. During the year long project and Jamboree, the cherry on top, she has realised she has learned so much,  and would love to share the experience with other students in the school. So this year's iGEM HAFS team rose amongst 7 junior students and 2 freshmen,  with Kyuhee Jo at the helm. Starting from April, we have struggled and struggled to get parts together and complete numerous experiments. We might not be the smartest competitor of iGEM 2018, but we are definitely the one who tried the best. We tried hard, really.
Now lets meet our team!
