Project Description
Project Summary
This year, our project was to develop a synthetic biology based oral delivery method for insulin to treat both type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. We aimed to engineer non propagating bacterial minicells to deliver insulin analog that can be absorbed by the intestinal epithelium. This system would eliminate the need to use invasive needles to inject insulin everyday. Our method is not only easier and faster but also considerably safe, since the minicells don't propagate and will be safely removed after achieving their goals. The figure below further elaborates on the workings of the E. coli couriers.
