The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <CODE>&lt;groupparts&gt;</CODE> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.</P><P>Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.</P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight decoration_background"><H3>Note</H3><P>Note that parts must be documented on the <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page"> Registry</A>.

The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you <B>do</B> need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)</P><DIV class="button_link"><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Add_a_Part_to_the_Registry">
