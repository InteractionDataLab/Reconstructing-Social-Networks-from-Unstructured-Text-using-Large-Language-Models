ABSTRACT
Type 1 and 2 Diabetes mellitus (T1DM, T2DM) are both caused by inappropriate insulin production. The former results from the lack of ß cell, while the later results from insulin resistance and impaired function of ß cell. In order to treat T1DM as well as severe cases of T2DM, patients should inject insulin analog multiple times a day. Because these analogues are readily degraded upon oral intake, the only method of injecting insulin analog is via invasive methods. We aimed to develop minicell-based insulin delivery system that can be orally administered. Minicells are achromosomal cells that do not reproduce. The deletion of Min system in E. coli ME8077 strain induces abnormal cell division that produces minicells. We have engineered the minicell to produce single chain insulin (Winsulin) associated with cell penetrating peptide that facilitates cellular intake. The expression of insulin was assessed through Western Blot. The cells lyse in response to bile salt, which leads to targeted secretion and subsequent intake of insulin in duodenum.
