The following is the list of plasmids iGEM headquarter provided us for the interlab study. We transformed all of the plasmids into  E. coli DH5α cells.
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 2B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 2D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 2F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 2H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 2J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 2L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 2N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 2P

Notes
We had a few problems while conductig interlab study. One of the most troublesome part was transformation. Due to the inappropriate concentration of CAM, all the colonies failed to grow in our first attempt.
