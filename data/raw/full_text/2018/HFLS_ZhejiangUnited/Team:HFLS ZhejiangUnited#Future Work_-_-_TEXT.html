Future Work
Our products at present is using aqueous formaldehyde solution as a test to be detected and absorbed in the experiment. So we plan to find more suitable methods for detecting gaseous formaldehyde in order to further advance practical engineering applications.
We will expect to further optimize our prototype in the following aspects, such as universality, portability, sensitivity and accessibility, to make it be more closer to actual needs.
Also, we are planning to advertise this competition to our schoolmates and help them to prepare for the next game. We will cooperate with our school advisors to set up IGEM club for students who have the spirits in synthetic biology.
