Collaborations
Our team finished the inter-lab with the ASTWS-China and WorldShaper-XSHS. In this inter-lab activity, they gave us some really effective help. For instance, they provided substrates to us in the case that we did not make enough substrates, which helps us save time in the experiment. In return, we assisted some materials to WorldShaper-XSHS. After the Inter-lab experiment, we exchanged our data with the other teams, which made the data more accurate.Furthermore, because of laboratory located the same building with ZJU-China in July then we moved to another building which ASTWS-China and Worldshaper-XSHS located in August, we have many collaboration for the project experiments, such as discussion on difficult technique problem or lent experimental materials.

Different from the last HP, which had been held by only high school teams, this time we were co-operating with three college teams to organize the activity. As we have known the basic procedure and organization form of this activity from the experience of the past HP, our team members gave a lot of useful suggestions on the online meeting, including how to teach kids about synthetic biology and some advice about game rules.

Through this activity, we learned a lot of skills and knowledge because of the participation of those college teams. Haosen Hong, the leader of IGEM team from Zhejiang University really worked hard for the activity: from the way of attracting participants to purchasing materials for HP to the revision of our teamâ€™s PPT, he helped us a lot in the process. We felt lucky that we could cooperate with those college teams. With this special lesson, we will be more enthusiastic about communicating with other teams in the future cooperations to broaden the outlooks.

With this special lesson, we will be more enthusiastic about communicating with other teams in the future cooperations to broaden the outlooks.
