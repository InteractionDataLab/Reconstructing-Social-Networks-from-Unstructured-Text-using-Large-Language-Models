Our project is aiming to detect and trap the copper ion in real world, such as industrial wastewater, soil etc. Basing on previous experimental results, we designed a copper processing equipment for sewage, including reservoir, processing cell, detection cell etc (Figure 1). In our device, the sewage to be treated is subjected to the following processes, separation and precipitation, copper treatment and copper detection. Finally, the treated sewage will be discharged after detective results being confirmed qualified. This equipment can not only alarm the excess copper ion (Visible to the naked eye), but also directly trapped copper ion by the constructed bacteria, providing another promising method to treat copper ion pollution.
