This is Cassie Tang from Randolph-Macon Academy. It's my second year of genetic engineering at school and my first year as an iGEMer. My one-year background really helps me in the process of designing our experiments and overall organizing our project. The experiment section of iGEM allows me to work in a top university first time in my life. The whole process is always about learning, communicating, and growing. It gives me a better idea of how modern science is developed and reinforces my dream of becoming a biologist in the future as well.</P><P style="color: darkgrey">I'm Batman</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="column"><DIV class="card"><DIV class="container"><H3><B>Yichen Guo</B></H3><P><B>Task:</B>wet team &amp; dry team member<B>Introduction:</B> Hi, my name is Ericson and I am a ninth grader currently studying at The Governor’s Academy. I love reading and writing, which gives me an advantage when scouring scholarly articles for information and when helping to write the team wiki. Even though I am one of the youngest members of the team, I am able to contribute to our team in many ways. IGEM has given me the opportunity to strengthen my understanding of synthetic biology and allowed me to make a difference in the world.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="column"><DIV class="card"><DIV class="container"><H3><B>Jingtian Xu</B></H3><P><B>Task:</B> wet team &amp; dry team member<B>Introduction:</B> Jeremiah Xu, 14 years old, studying in Britain for GCSE. One who have comprehensive skills (singing, acting, directing… you name it!!!).  However, Bioengineering distracted me from my hobbies. To be here as a starting biological researcher, I extrovert myself into our project with no doubt. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="column"><DIV class="card"><DIV class="container"><H3><B>Shuhao Chen</B></H3><P><B>Task:</B> wet team &amp; dry team member<B>Introduction:</B> I am Shuhao Chen, a student from the High School Attached to Zhejiang University. I am willing to observe and think in my free time, and I like natural science, painting and design. I have been in charge of advertising poster design in my junior high school as well. Reading books is my hobby, especially some domestic and foreign science fiction works. As biology and technology are the subjects that I am good at, I participated in the school biology competitions. I will try my best for IGEM.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="column"><DIV class="card"><DIV class="container"><H3><B>Yinuo Liu</B></H3><P><B>Task:</B> wet team &amp; dry team member<B>Introduction:</B> I'm May from Hangzhou Foreign Language School.

For me, attending iGem is a great opportunity to pursue high-level knowledge of biology and to have more friends.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="column"><DIV class="card"><DIV class="container"><H3><B>Ziting Yan</B></H3><P><B>Task:</B> wet team &amp; dry team member<B>Introduction:</B> I’m Calvin, a senior student from La Salle Academy at Rhode Island as a international students. And I usually spend my time on travel and hiking during weekends. Personally, I’m interested in biological engineering so that’s why I chose to join our IGEM team. And my purpose for is to enlarge my knowledge level. Therefore, I try hard to learn from other group members. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="column"><DIV class="card"><DIV class="container"><H3><B>Xueming Xu</B></H3><P><B>Task:</B> wet team member<B>Introduction:</B> I am Shirly, and I come from China- ZheJiang-Ningbo.

My hobby is reading books about biology. That is why I join this competition. Being a member of it allows me to know many excellent partners and to gain plenty of knowledge. Bio-synthesis is much more difficult than I think, therefore, it is way more challenging. However, I still do everything that I can to help my team to achieve the goal.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="column"><DIV class="card"><DIV class="container"><H3><B>Yingzhi Tang</B></H3><P><B>Task:</B> dry team member<B>Introduction:</B> I’m Christian Tang.

Being an expert in some aspects actually feels good, especially when I start to enjoy the process.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="column"><DIV class="card"><DIV class="container"><H3><B>Zijin He</B></H3><P><B>Task:</B> wet team member &amp; co-leader of experiment<B>Introduction:</B> Zijin He, Henry, a high school student who is interested in biology. He shows great responsibility and leadership during the project. He is not only familiar with most of the experiments but also can master every difficult lab work. He provides some profound, original insights to the project and integrates theory with practice. What’s more, self-examination is one of his qualities, which greatly contributes to developing of our project. He believes through the iGEM we can make a better world. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="column"><DIV class="card"><DIV class="container"><H3><B>Yuqian Hu</B></H3><P><B>Task:</B> wet team &amp; dry team member<B>Introduction:</B> Hi, I am Yuqian Hu from No.6 High School North American Center in Hefei. Due to the Breaking Bad and the white teacher thoroughly liked the chemistry and life sciences as well as the academic atmosphere, my purpose of participating in IGEM is not only a self-improvement exercise, but also more from the inner desire of this academic team to encourage innovation and this platform for everyone to come together to think about problems. Of course, at this age my interests and hobbies are not limited to this, usually in addition to the attributes of the technical ladder house but also love a sport, more friends, usually the kind of love often joke to adjust the atmosphere of the people. Blizzard games such as Watch Vanguard (my staircase 3500 + oh) and basketball (school team) have always been my favorites. So I believe I can quickly integrate into a large group, contribute to the team and become true friends with you.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="padding-wrapper"><DIV class="row"><P class="alignleft">Copyright © 2018 Team:ASTWS-China All Rights Reserved.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
