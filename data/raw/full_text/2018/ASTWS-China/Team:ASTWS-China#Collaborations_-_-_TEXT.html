Collaborations
We collaborated with HFLS_ZhejiangUnited , Worldshaper-XSHS , Worldshaper-Wuhan , Zhejiang University (ZJU-China) , Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT-China) as well as Jiangnan University (Jiangnan) . We have cooperated with the iGEM teams mentioned above on InterLab study, public investigation and public activities and discussion of experimental problems, etc.
InterLab Collaboration
Our Interlab study was done in collaboration with two other teams (HFLS_ZhejiangUnited, Worldshaper-XSHS). Before beginning the experiment, we carefully studied and discussed the official protocol provided by iGEM measurement together. Worldshaper-XSHS lends us their 96-well plates when ours are not adequately prepared. Moreover, when our first submission was failed, we together with worldshaper-XSHS and HFLS_ZhejiangUnited to analyze the data and find what the problem is. Thank you for their help given to us. We resubmit our data and was accepted by iGEM measurement committee on August 16. On the other hand, we offered the plate reader for them to do the InterLab study.
Project Experiments Collaboration
Besides the interlab study, we have many collaboration with Worldshaper- XSHS, HFLS-ZhejiangUnited as well as ZJU-China, since all our four teams base at Zhejiang University Zijingang Camps. During the summer, we visit each other quite frequently to discuss the technical problem and public activities. We borrowed the distribution Kit 1 and 2 from Worldshaper- XSHS and lent Kit 3 and 5 to them. Furthermore HFLS-ZhejiangUnited offered us the part eRFP when we failed to transform it twice. Then Worldshaper- XSHS met a great difficulty on transformation as well which blocked them project for more than one week, we discussed the all technical details together and help them find out the problem probably from their E. coli competent cells.
Public Activities Collaboration
According to the result of public survey, we found that the understanding of synthetic biology and genetic-modified related works is clearly insufficient for general public. For Team HFLS_ZhejiangUnited, Worldshaper-XSHS, Worldshaper-Wuhan, Zhejiang University (ZJU-China), Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT-China) and as well as Jiangnan University (Jiangnan), they were also aware of this problem. So we cooperate with each other to hold public science activities for the same purpose.
In Hangzhou low carbon science and technology museum China, our team, together with HFLS_ZhejiangUnited, Worldshaper-XSHS, Worldshaper-Wuhan, held one united public event to publicize our project and related knowledge of synthetic biology and genetic engineering. We have conducted in-depth cooperation from various aspects. For example, we discussed the activity plan, prepared the materials we needed. When we were understaffed, Worldshaper-XSHS and HFLS_ZhejiangUnited helped us to undertake the DNA extraction experiment and maintain the order, respectively. The event achieved a good response.
We also had lots of fun working together towards a shared goal. On the day of practicing in Hangzhou low carbon science and technology museum, we gathered together earlier than the opening time. After briefly talked about each team’s responsibility in the activity, we started preparing our own tasks. Our team’s job was mainly focused on setting up different stations demonstrating science experiments about our topic and generally Genetics. While the other two teams had their own stations and were responsible for a reward station to encourage kids to finish the activities in every station, we held by giving out gifts for accomplishment, as well as,  maintaining the order in stations. As the main demonstrator of the experiment of gene extraction of bananas, we lectured kids about genetics and the lab procedure. In the end, almost everyone, no matter what team they were in, worked together to help out with each and every level of the experiment.
In Zhejiang science and technology museum, we held a bigger event, called 2018 Shengxi Science Day, on Aug. 19th. In this event, we not only cooperated with two other high school team (HFLS_ZhejiangUnited, Worldshaper-XSHS), but also cooperated with three university team including Zhejiang University (ZJU-China), Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT-China) and Jiangnan University (Jiangnan). ZJU-China organized and coordinated the entire activity. And thanks to the experience of the previous cooperation in organizing the event, we put forward a lot of constructive suggestion during the planning of this event. This activity consists of several parts, including guidance, mini game, Q&A sessions, and topic presentations. We have planned and organized the pigment extraction part and introduced our project in Q&A sessions, and topic presentations. We have gained much experience of organizing the event, and we sincerely thank all those who have organized and cooperated with us for our activities.
