We constructed several parts in the project, including parts related to copper detection (BBa_K2826008, BBa_K2826009) and copper treatment (BBa_K2826011, BBa_K2826013). The real sample Sewage obtained from Baoding Baoyun Plate Making Co.Ltd (Abb. BAOYUN) was tested using the two versions of detection devices and treatment device, making sure that it could be used in real world.
As we know, pollution problem especially water pollution has always been a concerning topic. Especially industrial waste water containing copper ion will be produced during the manufacturing process. After understanding our project, BAOYUN is willing to invest in our experiment, to find biological solutions to lower the copper pollution in the water, therefore, bringing new technologies into the factory. Our dry team leader, Justin Yan, visited the company and attained the cooperation intention with them. The original copper inside the water before filtering is 5-184mg/L.
Figure 1: Justin Yan was visiting the Baoding Baoyun Plate Making Co.Ltd.
Justin Yan, our dry team leader, came to BAOYUN again for collecting sewage sample of 3,000ml. He sending 500ml to Baoding Runhe Environment Protection Technology Co., Ltd. (Abb. RUNHE) and getting a detection result of initial water sample is 5.75mg/L (Detected by RUNHE).

As shown in Figure 3, using our detection device (BBa_K2826008) to sense the copper concentration in sewage sample (Volume medium : Volume sewage = 1:1), the curve of waste water was coincided with the one of 3 mg/L copper concentration. And the comparative photos was revealed the same truth. In the other words, the copper concentration of waste water sensing by our detection device was nearly 6 mg/L which is approximative to 5.75 mg/L.

Subsequently, in order to verify the copper adsorption efficiency of our copper treatment device (BBa_K2826013), two methods, including ICP in our lab and return the after-treated sample to RUNHE. As shown in figure 4, compared with control group, the copper concentration of test group treated with our devie (BBa_K2826013) is obviously decreased. It proves that our device was working as we expected. However, the results obtained by RUNHE is 6.11 mg/L, a little high than the initial concentration. This may be due to excessive storage time and heating, etc., causing the water to volatilize.

Although we did not get enough evidence to prove that our treatment device works normal in real samples, our detection device was verified to work in real sewage sample as we expected. And measuring the OD600 and fluorescence intensity of RFP, the copper ion could be quantitatively detected. This result is somewhat regrettable but still very encouraging. If further to optimize, our device could be a promising method to sense copper pollution in real environment.
The direction is clearer in the future. The actual detection result for the sewage sample witnesses that our construction method can be used for the actual sewage sample detection and verify the utilization possibility of actual detection. Currently, the sewage treatment system is composed of 7 different units: neutralization, settlement, sand leach, carbon-filtrating, resin exchange, ultrafiltration, and antiosmosis. After the process in the system, the waste water could have a copper level lower than 0.15mg/L. Although the process meets the government’s requirement, it takes to much space and the electrical usage is huge. The cost is high, and the working environment is unpleasant. So our goal is to reduce the density of copper in water effectively and economically.
Based on this experimental result as well as the experience of visit research, we have made the design thought, sketch and model of a molding product through the drainage data of BAOYUN. As followed is design schematic and 3D modeling diagram of copper processing equipment. Please go to Applied Design page for the detail.
