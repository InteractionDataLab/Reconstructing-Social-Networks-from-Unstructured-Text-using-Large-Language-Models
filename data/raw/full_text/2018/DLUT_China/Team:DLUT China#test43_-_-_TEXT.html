What the team accomplished：
We start in the lab and our brainstorming of HP in May 2018. Most importantly, we started working on our project in November 2017 – inviting well-known iGEMer and professors at home and abroad to give lectures to help students know and understanding the synthetic biology engineering design and construction ideas, so that students really feel the wonders and creativity of this field.
1 We conduct public communication with video and interactive activities at the campus culture festival to promote IGEM and synthetic biology
2 We learned more about hyperuricemia from Hospital through expert interviews, affirming the value of this project.
3 We set up the “IGEM Classroom” and went to Dalian Xianglujiao Primary School in June 2018, and went to the affiliated high school of Dalian University of Technology in September 2018. What worth mentioning is that It is worth mentioning that this time we have established a long-term human practice base with high school and distributed course materials free of charge. After this 2018 competition, we will continue to go to high school to start theoretical and experimental courses on synthetic biology. Here is the syllabus.
