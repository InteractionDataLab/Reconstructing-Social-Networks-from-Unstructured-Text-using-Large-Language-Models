A fancy story about us detecting and fighting HUA (the high urbic acid) with UOX (Uric acid oxidase) man
Background
Learn more
Hyperuricemia is a annoying monster. It is a representation of abnormally high levels of uric acid in the blood and is best at attacking human joints, which can cause acute gout arthritis, chronic gout arthritis and even joint deformities. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg of evil damage. It can also damage the kidney, cause abnormal renal function, cause chronic kidney diseases such as renal stone and renal colic, and is closely related to metabolic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and fatty liver.
The various forces currently battling hyperuricemia show their deficiencies: side effects, drug resistance, painful treatment processes, and so on. Therefore, we all look forward to the hero who can truly defeat hyperuricemia.
The Urate Oxidase will be the hero, an enzyme in organisms that catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid in purine metabolism. It can oxidize uric acid to 5-hydroxy iso-uric acid, an unstable compound that is readily converted to allantoin in organisms. Allantoin can be easily metabolized by the kidney, thus lowering the body's blood uric acid level. When uric acid oxidase attacks hyperuricemia, the target of action is uric acid itself, so it will not hurt the body.
