                    in synthetic biology measurements, so that eventually, measurements that are taken in different labs
                    will be no more variable than measurements taken within the same lab. </P><P>This year, we use two orthogonal approaches to compute the cell count in our samples.</P><OL><LI>Converting between absorbance of cells to absorbance of a known concentration of beads.</LI><LI>Counting colony-forming units (CFUs) from the sample.</LI></OL></DIV><DIV><H2 class="title">Plate reader and CFU</H2><DIV class="mainText"><H3 class="title">Calibration protocol</H3><P>Before we started the plate reader measurement, we obtained the OD600 reference point, the
                        fluorescein fluorescence curve and the particle standard curve in the microplate reader to
                        standardize the absorbance reading, cell-based fluorescence reading and the number of
                        cells.</P><P>Our model was a SpectraMax M2e Plate Reader. For the plate reader our excitation and emission
                        settings were 485 nm and 525 nm respectively (Same setting was used for all experiments

                        was taken from each two colonies of the 8 devices and were placed immediately on ice to prevent
                        further growth. At the end of sampling point, 4 replicates 100 μl of each sample was pipetted
                        into a 96-well microplate with the arrangement. Data was imported into the Excel Sheet for

                        directly relatable to the cell concentration of the culture. At this protocol, we first Dilute
                        our overnight culture to OD<SUB>600</SUB> =0.1in 1ml of LB+Cam media. We further diluted the
                        culture according to the experimental protocol than cultivate these dilutions for 18-20hours.
