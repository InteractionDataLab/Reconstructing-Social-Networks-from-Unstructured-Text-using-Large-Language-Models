                        immobilization and detection, and to digitize the results into accurate numbers. This model can
                        guide us to more accurately determine the relationship between the reaction results and our
                        effects in three phases. Especially in the detection, the concentration of the analyte can be
                        embodied and digitized, thus giving us a better and specific detection limit.</P><P>For the gray value calculation of a resulting image, we first grayscale it. In order to calculate
                        the gray value of the color picture, we have grayed out with MATLAB. At the same time, in order
                        to give a clear grayscale picture, we performed image equalization and gave a balanced
                        picture<SUP>[Attachment 1]</SUP>. After obtaining the grayscale image, we use the formula (1) to
                        calculate the grayscale of the image. In order to obtain accurate data more conveniently, we use
                        the programming language to design a small software <SUP>[Attachment 2]</SUP>, which can
                        calculate the average grayscale of the image. There is an error in the data for the no grayscale
                        picture. According to our experimental results, it is about 5% when the gray value is not too
                        low. Compared with the equalized grayscale image, the error is about 10%.</P><P>$$ g_w = \sum_{i=0}^{255} i \times T_i \div T \tag{1} $$</P><P>For the experimental results, we can understand whether it is fixed antigen, immobilized antibody
                        or detection. In the initial stage, the gray value is positively correlated with the
                        concentration of the additive; and as the concentration of the additive increases, the gray
                        value is not proportional to the increase. There are two models that satisfy these properties,
                        namely equation (2) and formula (3):</P><P>Michaelis-Menten model: $$ y = \frac{\alpha x}{\beta + x} \tag{2} $$</P><P>Exponential growth model: $$ y = \alpha (1- exp(-\beta x)) \tag{3} $$</P><P>We substituting the above two formulas into the literature we examined<SUP>[2]</SUP>, where model
                        (2) is in
                        good agreement. At the same time model (2) if the enzyme is compared to our slide, the substrate
                        is analogous to our addition. The resulting enzymatic reaction rate-substrate concentration and
                        gray value-addition concentration have a good fit. So we decided to use this model. And in the
                        other literature<SUP>[1]</SUP> of the model, the results obtained are also consistent. The gray
                        value and

                        amount of experimental data to average and reduce the error. Experimental Results After data
                        processing, the Figures 1(c), Equations \(\mathrm{Y_1}\), can be obtained. The resulting image
                        was used to

                        built is in line with our experiments. Thus, we further established the model on antibody
                        immobilization and obtained the results of equations \(\mathrm{Z_1}\). From the model and our
                        experimental
                        data, it can be stated that the gray value and the additive concentration are positively
                        correlated when the concentration is not large. From the model and our experimental data, it can
                        be stated that the gray value and the additive concentration are positively correlated when the

                        gray values of the unfixed antigen. The \(\mathrm{Y_1}\) equation is the result of correcting
                        the zero
                        point deviation and the post-processing of the comparison relation \(\mathrm{Ψ_q}\).
                        \(\mathrm{Z_1}\) can be obtained
                        by treating the modified antibody model in the same manner.
