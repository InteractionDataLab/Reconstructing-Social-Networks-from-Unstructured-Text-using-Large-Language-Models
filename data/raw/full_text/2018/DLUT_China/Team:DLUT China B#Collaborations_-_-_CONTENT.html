                        our projects. After the introduction of the team project, we started brainstorming on the
                        project together, the most prominent of which is the proposal for high-throughput application of
                        the test method of the project, and the proposal of team cooperation.</P><P>Through this interflow, we have enriched our ideas on this project, and we are also moved by the
                        enthusiasm of Peking University students. This is our first collaboration, which provides a lot
                        of different ideas for our project.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><H2 class="title">Northeastern University</H2><DIV class="mainText"><P>Time: 27 Aug, 2018</P><P>Location: The Meeting Room of Northeastern University Life Science Building</P><P>Participant: Four iGEM teams from Northeastern University and Dalian University of Technology</P><P>Content:</P><P>The meeting began with the introduction of their project by the iGEM-A team of Northeastern
                        University. Team A's research project is engineering probiotics, and they expect to study
                        methods to alleviate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) that
                        may be triggered. The next is the Northeastern University iGEM-B team. Team B students turned
                        their attention to wine and its excess lactic acid.</P><P>After the students of Northeastern University showed up, the students of DLUT-A team brought
                        their team's research on gout disease. High levels of uric acid in human blood may cause acute
                        gouty arthritis, etc., and existing methods for treating high levels of uric acid have many side
                        effects. The students of the DLUT-A team plan to oxidize uric acid to 5-hydroxyisouric acid by
                        engineering bacteria to express a uric acid oxidase. The compound is decomposed and quickly
                        decomposed into allantoin which is easily metabolized, thereby reducing uric acid. </P><P>Finally, the DLUT-B team brought a portable introduction to the detection of β<SUB>2</SUB>-microglobulin. By
                        immobilizing the Nanobody on the slide, a change in the alignment of the liquid crystal causes a
                        change in the brightness of the image to detect an excessive excess of β<SUB>2</SUB>-micro in the urine. As
                        a possible marker of chronic kidney disease, β<SUB>2</SUB>-micro is an effective and portable method for
                        early detection of chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes and hypertension. In
                        addition, team B students considered co-expression of Nanobodies with an enzyme to catalyze the
                        immobilization of Nanobodies with the addition of an aldehyde group at the end of the
                        Nanobody.</P><P>After the introduction of the team project, the students of the two schools raised questions and
                        discussed the contents of some projects. The students of the A team of Northeastern University
                        also took the opportunity to introduce some of the excellent genetic pathway design schemes of
                        iGEM. Further exchanges of some views, including the design of the pathway, the problems related
                        to the experimental process, the development of the practice, and the design of the website Wiki
                        artwork. Everyone had a pleasant conversation during the exchange and expressed their
                        willingness to carry out further cooperation.</P><P>Tag: The exchange meeting ended in a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere. We look forward to the
                        exchanges and cooperation between the Dalian University of Technology and the iGEM team of
                        Northeastern University.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><H2 class="title">CCiC in Shanghai</H2><DIV class="mainText"><P>The CCiC exchange meeting was held at Shanghai University of Science and Technology. Two teams
                        from our school went to the conference. The team participated in the trouble shooting process,
                        shared some problems in the project with other teams, and got suggestions and help from other
                        teams. In the poster session, we showed posters to everyone and showed our posters to interested
                        students. In the exchange, we also gained a lot of suggestions and inspired. In the final
                        representation. We showed the type of testing together with the students of the Tsinghua A team,
                        and received a review from Dr. Zhang Haoqian, a senior iGEMer.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><H2 class="title">Ocean University of China</H2><DIV class="mainText"><P>At the 5th CCiC meeting, we were very interested in the science and engineering brochure
                        “SPACESHIP E.coli” designed by OUC-China. After the meeting, we contacted the OUC-China team,
                        hoping for the cooperative activities of promoting the science of synthetic biology. OUC-China
                        will provide us with an electronic version of comics. Our team members will carry out
                        promotional activities in Dalian, including posting comic posters &quot;SPACESHIP E.coli&quot; and iGEM
                        posters in various high schools in Dalian, and in 2018 10 , the results will be fed back to
                        OUC-China before the 3rd of the month.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer"><DIV id="address"><H3> Address</H3><P>No.2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian City, Liaoning Province, P.R.C., 116024</P><H3> E-mail</H3><P>igem_dlut_china_B#163.com (Please replace # with @)</P></DIV><DIV id="follow"><H3>Follow Us</H3><DIV id="platformName"><P> WeChat</P><P> Weibo</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
