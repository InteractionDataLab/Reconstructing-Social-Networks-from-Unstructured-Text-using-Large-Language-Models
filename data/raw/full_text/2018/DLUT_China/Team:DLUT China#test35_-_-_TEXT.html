Igem Xuzhou communication meeting
  Northeastern    University  
rPeking University
    On July 14, 2018, we came to Peking University for a collaboration and exchanged ideas with Peking University's IGEM team.
    After the self-introduction, we introduced each other's projects and proposed suggestions on the project. The project of Peking University's IGEM team is to design a protein scaffold to increase the enzymatic reaction rate and yield, and hope to be applied to industrial production. In the exchange, we raised our confusion and exchanged experimental design.
    Later, we introduced our own projects, and Peking University students also made opinions for the improvement of our projects. In addition to considering whether urate oxidase can be expressed and correctly modified in E. coli nissle, we should also consider whether UOX can pass through the intestinal wall cells from the intestinal tract into the blood, rather than being "absorbed" by the intestinal wall cells. In addition, due to the existence of certain immunological rejection of human uric acid oxidase, the immune response of UOX in the blood is also a problem that I must think about and solve.
    During the collaboration and exchange with Peking University's IGEM team, we saw each other's bright spots and re-examined our projects from a new perspective. In such exchanges and thoughts, we believe that we will find problems in our thinking, improve our projects, and make progress together to showcase the charm of Chinese students on the international stage of IGEM.
rNorheastern University
    In August 2018, we came to Shenyang, China, and exchanged ideas with two iGEM teams at Northeastern University, and further explored the next step of cooperation.
    First, we introduced the iGEM project and provided comments on each other's projects. Since our team currently lacks a lethal system, in this exchange, we worked with NEU_China_A to jointly verify and optimize the cold shock system, improve the project, and meet the iGEM safety requirements.(To be continued)
rIgem Xuzhou Communication Meeting
    At the beginning of the meeting, the four universities (Dalian university of technology, Lanzhou university, Jiangnan university, Zhejiang university of technology) publicized the igem related situation to the students present and answered everyone's questions. Since the meeting was in the third quarter of the National Undergraduate Life Science Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, it achieved good publicity. Next, the four universities introduced their projects in turn, accepted questions from everyone, and explained the bottlenecks of the project, hoping to get inspiration through discussion.
    Our team's project has aroused great interest from the teachers and students present. Everyone said that the project is novel, practical, and cleverly designed, but at the same time it also put forward many opinions. First of all, because our products have to enter the human body, the lethal system is essential, and how to maintain it in the body is controllable and effective is also an extremely important problem; secondly, how do we penetrate the intestinal wall to act on the blood; finally, respond in vivo What is the threshold value of uric acid and can be sensed before the minimum value. We answered the above questions one by one.
    This exchange will be very rewarding, not only learning the advantages of other teams, but also discovering their own shortcomings. And with the help of some teams, Jiangnan University expressed its willingness to provide E. coli exocrine system. Zhejiang University of Technology expressed its willingness to exchange experience in mathematical modeling and learned that Beijing University of Technology has a signal amplification system.
