Brochure designing and propagating
In order to allow more diabetic patients to realize the dangers of the development of chronic                         kidney disease in the later stage, and to help the middle-aged and the elderly to improve their                         awareness of prevention, our team members have carefully designed the Kidney Diseases Brochure.                         The brochure includes four aspects including the causes of kidney disease, how to detect kidney                         disease, warning signs of kidney disease and how to prevent kidney disease.
In July 2018, the team members came to the Jianshan Community in Dalian to hold a knowledge                         lecture on early prevention of kidney disease. At the Community Activity Center, we distributed the brochures to everyone to let them learn about the dangers of kidney disease, the causes of                         kidney disease and ways to prevent early kidney disease. After our explanation, residents’                         awareness of CKD has been significantly raised. During the promotion process, the residents                         asked many questions about diabetic nephropathy. The team members have answered them one by                         one.
Through this event, growing number of people were aware of the importance of regular medical                         examinations and have a deeper understanding of kidney disease. They also learned about the                         prevention of diabetic nephropathy and hypertensive nephropathy through this opportunity.

Publicity on the Campus Day
In May 2018, on the Campus Day of Dalian University of Technology, the DLUT_China_B team carried                         out a series of activities to expand the influence of synthetic biology and iGEM competition at                         Dalian University of Technology. Them designed the “Prize-giving Quiz” game to give the guests a                         general knowledge of biology. “Understanding Micro-World” provides visitors with microscopes and                         some samples made by the team members which let them to observe and understand the microbes we                         can't see. This part attracted many primary and middle school students.
This exhibition not only introduced synthetic biology and iGEM competitions, but also promoted                         our Dr. Familict project to let more people know the seriousness of kidney disease. We also got                         some valuable market research data. The public has given considerable attention to the project,                         which also makes our project more meaningful.

Lead Synthetic biology into the campus
In order to propaganda synthetic biology knowledge to primary and secondary schools more vividly                         in Dalian, our decided to work with OUC-CHINA. Their team members will design synthetic biology                         science brochures and we would made into a poster. The poster will be displayed together with                         the posters of DLUT_CHINA_B in several primary and secondary schools in Dalian as well as the                         libraries of Dalian University of Technology. We hope that more primary and middle school                         students will grow a great interest in synthetic biology through the activities.
Our team came to the High School affiliated to Dalian University of Technology. After the team                         members explained the principle of synthetic biology, many students have shown a great interest                         in synthetic biology.
This communication not only allowed us to look at our projects more seriously and rigorously, but                         also provided some new ideas for the students of the iGEM association, which broadened their                         horizons and inspire them to learn more about synthetic biology. We hoped that our iGEM                         publicity trip would arouse the students’ interest in synthetic biology and contribute to the                         development of the iGEM competition in China.
