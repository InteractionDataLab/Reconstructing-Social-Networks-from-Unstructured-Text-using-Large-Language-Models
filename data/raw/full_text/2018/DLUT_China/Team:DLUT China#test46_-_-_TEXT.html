Short description: PhucO-HucR-ygfU
Long description:This circuit is composed of the promoter hucO, hypothetical uricase regulator which called HucR and uric acid transporter which called ygfU. When uric acid is absent, HucR protein binds to PhucO and blocks the binding of RNA polymerase, preventing the expression of related genes. When uric acid is present, the binding of HucR protein to PhucO is inhibited by uric acid molecules, making HucR protein unable to bind to PhucO, initiating the expression of related genes. ygfU can transport the external uric acid to the bacteria, and the addition of ygfU makes our sequence more sensitive to the concentration of uric acid.

Short description:PhucO-HucR-ygfU-lysis
Long description: This circuit is composed of the promoter hucO, hypothetical uricase regulator which called HucR, uric acid transporter which called ygfU and lysis protein. When uric acid is absent, the HucR protein binds to PhucO and blocks the binding of RNA polymerase, preventing the expression of the lysis protein gene, and the cells survive. When uric acid is present, the binding of HucR protein to PhucO is inhibited by uric acid molecules, making the HucR protein unable to bind to PhucO, activating the expression of the lysis protein gene, and killing the bacterium (considering the use of detoxifying proteins or less toxic proteins). ygfU transports external uric acid to bacteria, and the addition of ygfU makes our sequence more sensitive to uric acid concentrations.

Short description: PhucO-HucR-ygfU-sRNA-lysis
Long description: This circuit is composed of the promoter hucO, hypothetical uricase regulator which called HucR, uric acid transporter which called ygfU, sRNA and lysis protein. When uric acid is absent, the HucR protein binds to PhucO and blocks the binding of RNA polymerase, preventing the expression of sRNA and lysis protein genes. When uric acid is present, the binding of HucR protein to PhucO is inhibited by uric acid molecules, making the HucR protein unable to bind to PhucO, activating the expression of sRNA and lysis protein genes (considering the use of detoxified proteins or less toxic proteins). The sRNA can inhibit the expression of the lysis protein gene of Part 4. Part4's sRNA can inhibit the expression of Part3's cleavage protein gene. When one of the plasmids is lost, the lysis protein that has not lost the plasmid is not inhibited, resulting in lysis of the cells to prevent the loss of a single plasmid. ygfU transports external uric acid to bacteria, and the addition of ygfU makes our sequence more sensitive to uric acid concentrations.

Short description: PhucO-HucR-ygfU-lysisi
Long description:, This circuit is composed of the sRNA and lysis protein. The sRNA can inhibit the expression of the lysis protein gene of Part 3. Part3's sRNA can inhibit the expression of Part4's cleavage protein gene. When one of the plasmids is lost, the lysis protein that has not lost the plasmid is not inhibited, resulting in lysis of the cells to prevent the loss of a single plasmid.

Short description: PoLB-HucR-ygfU-Cyclic peptide
Long description: This circuit is composed of the signal peptide PoLB, urate oxidate and cell penetrating peptide cyclic peptide. PoLB is an exocrine signal of the secreted protein of E. coli. Cyclic peptides are penetration signals of mammalian cells. Uric acid oxidase can degrade uric acid to allantoin.
