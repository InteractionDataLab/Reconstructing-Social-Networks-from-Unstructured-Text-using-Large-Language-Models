Problem
Gout is a kind of metabolic disease caused by the urate crystals at the joints and deposited in the tissue, which is as a result of the body’s purine metabolic disorder and decreased excretion of uric acid in the kidney, making the blood uric acid (sUA) level increase. The nature of gout is hyperuricemia —— a more terrible evil than gout!
Hyperuricemia refers to the symptom that the level of uric acid is unusually high in blood. It commonly affects joints and leads to the acute/chronic gouty arthritis which are shown as joint deformity. But the this is just the tip of the iceberg for hyperuricemia’s harm. Hyperuricemia also can damage the kidney, causing renal abnormalities and chronic kidney disease. What’s more, it has something to do with  diabetes and other metabolic diseases.
