                        polarizer, one card slot, and one chip. This also brings the trouble of the user, the user needs
                        to time and rinse. Below is the structure diagram and physical map of the first generation
                        product.</P><TABLE class="img"><TBODY><TR><TD colspan="2"><P class="footnote">Fig.1 The First Generation of Dr. Familict</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV><DIV><H2 class="title">The Second Generation of Dr. Familict</H2><DIV class="mainText"><H3 class="title">Instruction</H3><P>Dr. Familict, the visualized liquid-crystal-based urine protein detector, is a 20cm×20cm×10cm
                        brick-sized box. It consists mainly a slide holder slot, a wash buffer chamber, a waste
                        collector, a liquid-crystal cell, polarizer and analyzer. Up on using, just plug in a
                        antigen-coated glass slide to the slot, a drop of antibody solution is loaded automatically when
                        the slide is placed properly. The user then only needs to add a drop of urine to the test zone,
                        and press the bottom to start timing. The following operations will be done automatically. After
                        the reaction is completed, the slide is rinsed for 30 s. Then it is drove slightly to the
                        detection area. Upon slide positioning, liquid-crystal is loaded and the bottom light is
                        switched on upon slide positioning. After the polarized light passes, visible color changes are
                        produced. Users can take a picture and upload the result to the Mobile APP and get medication
                        advice.</P><H3 class="title">Liquid-crystal Cell</H3><P>The liquid crystal cell is the most important part of the test box. When the upper slider slides
                        to the observation area, it is assembled with the upper slide of the liquid crystal cell into a
                        self-assembled film spaced 6 micrometers apart, and then the liquid crystal cell on the left
                        side of the slide is opened, and the liquid crystal enters between the upper and lower slides
                        due to capillary action. At this point, the microstructure of the slide will affect the
                        orientation change of the liquid crystal. After turning on the light at the bottom of the test
                        box, the light passes through the polarizer, then through the cell, and finally through the
                        analyzer above the cell, so we can observe changes in brightness and color.</P><H3 class="title">Wash buffer chamber and waste collector</H3><P>These two components are used to wash unfixed antigens, antibodies and other impurity proteins on
                        the slide. When the user drops the urine and the antibody solution, the test box starts to
                        timing. After the reaction reaches 40 minutes, the time is over, the buffer chamber gate is
                        opened, the slide is started to be washed for 30 seconds, and the buffer flows into the waste
                        collector. When the waste collection area is full and can be replaced, as the same user can
                        easily replace the buffer box by himself.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer"><DIV id="address"><H3> Address</H3><P>No.2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian City, Liaoning Province, P.R.C., 116024</P><H3> E-mail</H3><P>igem_dlut_china_B#163.com (Please replace # with @)</P></DIV><DIV id="follow"><H3>Follow Us</H3><DIV id="platformName"><P> WeChat</P><P> Weibo</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
