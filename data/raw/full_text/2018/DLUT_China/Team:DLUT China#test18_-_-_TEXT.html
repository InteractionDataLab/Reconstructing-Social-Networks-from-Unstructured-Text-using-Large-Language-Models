Problem
Hyperuricemia refers to the abnormal high level of uric acid in the blood. The most frequently affected area is the joint, which can cause acute gout arthritis, chronic gout arthritis and joint deformity. However, joint injury is only the tip of the iceberg of hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia can also damage the kidney, causing abnormal renal function, kidney stones, renal colic and other chronic kidney diseases. Hyperuricemia not only damages the joints and kidneys, but also is closely related to metabolic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and fatty liver.
