As a senior igem team, Peking University has provided many reliable and effective suggestions for                         our projects. After the introduction of the team project, we started brainstorming on the                         project together, the most prominent of which is the proposal for high-throughput application of                         the test method of the project, and the proposal of team cooperation.
Through this interflow, we have enriched our ideas on this project, and we are also moved by the                         enthusiasm of Peking University students. This is our first collaboration, which provides a lot                         of different ideas for our project.
Collaboration with Northeastern University
Time: 27 Aug, 2018
Location: The Meeting Room of Northeastern University Life Science Building
Participant: Four iGEM teams from Northeastern University and Dalian University of Technology

The meeting began with the introduction of their project by the iGEM-A team of Northeastern                         University. Team A's research project is engineering probiotics, and they expect to study                         methods to alleviate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) that                         may be triggered. The next is the Northeastern University iGEM-B team. Team B students turned                         their attention to wine and its excess lactic acid.
After the students of Northeastern University showed up, the students of DLUT-A team brought                         their team's research on gout disease. High levels of uric acid in human blood may cause acute                         gouty arthritis, etc., and existing methods for treating high levels of uric acid have many side                         effects. The students of the DLUT-A team plan to oxidize uric acid to 5-hydroxyisouric acid by                         engineering bacteria to express a uric acid oxidase. The compound is decomposed and quickly                         decomposed into allantoin which is easily metabolized, thereby reducing uric acid.
Finally, the DLUT-B team brought a portable introduction to the detection of β2-microglobulin. By                         immobilizing the Nanobody on the slide, a change in the alignment of the liquid crystal causes a                         change in the brightness of the image to detect an excessive excess of β2-micro in the urine. As                         a possible marker of chronic kidney disease, β2-micro is an effective and portable method for                         early detection of chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes and hypertension. In                         addition, team B students considered co-expression of Nanobodies with an enzyme to catalyze the                         immobilization of Nanobodies with the addition of an aldehyde group at the end of the                         Nanobody.
After the introduction of the team project, the students of the two schools raised questions and                         discussed the contents of some projects. The students of the A team of Northeastern University                         also took the opportunity to introduce some of the excellent genetic pathway design schemes of                         iGEM. Further exchanges of some views, including the design of the pathway, the problems related                         to the experimental process, the development of the practice, and the design of the website Wiki                         artwork. Everyone had a pleasant conversation during the exchange and expressed their                         willingness to carry out further cooperation.
Tag: The exchange meeting ended in a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere. We look forward to the                         exchanges and cooperation between the Dalian University of Technology and the iGEM team of                         Northeastern University.
CCIC in Shanghai
The CCIC exchange meeting was held at Shanghai University of Science and Technology. Two teams                         from our school went to the conference. The team participated in the trouble shooting process,                         shared some problems in the project with other teams, and got suggestions and help from other                         teams. In the poster session, we showed posters to everyone and showed our posters to interested                         students. In the exchange, we also gained a lot of suggestions and inspired. In the final                         representation. We showed the type of testing together with the students of the Tsinghua A team,                         and received a review from Dr. Zhang Haoqian, a senior iGEMER.
Cooperation with Ocean University of China
At the 5th CCiC meeting, we were very interested in the science and engineering brochure                         “SPACESHIP E.coli” designed by OUC-China. After the meeting, we contacted the OUC-China team,                         hoping for the cooperative activities of promoting the science of synthetic biology. OUC-China                         will provide us with an electronic version of comics. Our team members will carry out                         promotional activities in Dalian, including posting comic posters "SPACESHIP E.coli" and iGEM                         posters in various high schools in Dalian, and in 2018 10 , the results will be fed back to                         OUC-China before the 3rd of the month.
