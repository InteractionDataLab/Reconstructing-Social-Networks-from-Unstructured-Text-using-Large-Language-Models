Meet Us
Hello, everyone. I'm Han Xue, a junior student whose hairline is getting                             higher and higher. I'm mainly responsible for the Human Practice. I participated in the iGEM                             for the first time and made progress during the competition.
I'm Xie Yan, student leader of DLUT_China_B. I'm abiomacromule fan. I'm                             glad that you're interested in our project. Email: xieyan7736@163.com
I am Weixu, from Dalian University of Technology. My major is Chemistry. In                         our project, I am in charge of liquid crystal experiment.
I'm Zheng Ruichao, in charge of the development of Wiki for our team. Major in                         software engineering, I enjoy coding and programming very much. For me, it's also challenge to                         take part in iGEM this time.
Peng Xilei, an engineering student from an engineering school who pursues                             science.
I am Shu Xun, a 20-year-old who likes to paint. I hope to make friends                             with you.
Zhu Jinwei, a junior student majoring in Life Science and Technology. I have                         got a lot of fun from working with our team members. I enjoy every night from the lab to the                         dormitory. The school feels clean this time of night. Just empty streets and me.
My name is Xu Kang, a 3rd year biology engineering student, from school of                         life science and technology, Dalian University of Tcehnology. In our team, I am mainly                         responsible for the wet experiment, including interlab. In life, I like running and hiking. My                         favorite poem is find a moment of leisure in a busy life.
Active, talkative, enthusiastic about almost everything, but also shy,                             quiet and not brave enough. Do you want to know whom that strange girl is? Ah-ha, that's me!                             My name is Chen Kaidi, and you can also call me Cathy. I am a girl who love to try new                             things and challenge myself. Not only biology is in my interests, but I am fond of ancient                             Chinese and history as well. I enjoy fighting with a hard problem and discussing with my                             friends to explore the solution. I really really want to make friends with all of you                             explorers!
My name is Zhu Jingyi. I'm a pretty outgoing girl and have passionate interests in multiple                             spectrums of activities, particularly with swimming and paper-cut. The trademark of myself,                             is, an excellent teamwork player. The teamwork spirits always motivated me to explore the                             gifts inside myself and fully coordinate with the team members to attain the ultimate                             accomplishment.
Zhiyue Wu: I am a sophomore from DLUT in PRC with an outgoing and diligent                             character, majoring in bio-engineering. It's my pleasure to have a chance to take part in                             IGEM from which I have learned a lot.
My name is Zhang Yawei. In order to learn more about synthetic biology and get touch with more                             people who are interested in biology, I participated in the iGEM team of my university. I                             played as an art designer and background researcher. Meanwhile, I will help lab group do                             some experiments and consult literatures. This experience is really meaningful to me.
