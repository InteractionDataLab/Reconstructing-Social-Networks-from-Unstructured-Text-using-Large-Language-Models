Pupils classroom
By DLUT_China HP group June 2018
In order to expand the influence of the team and introduce synthetic biology,We came to Dalian Xianglujiao Primary School.A special interactive classroom for primary school students start here.
In the classroom, the students were very enthusiastic and actively asked questions, showing a strong curiosity about biological issues such as genes\proteins. What is protein? Where is the protein in our body? What is an enzyme? How much does the enzyme work in our body?
Through this special lesson, the children have a new understanding of the function of the substance in the human body, and also know the importance of nutritional balance in life.
Like a blank paper , they had never touched biological knowledge.Our publicity and education be very successful and effective.Children curiosity also deeply infects us and strengthens our confidence.
Carnival at the campus culture festival
By DLUT_China HP group May 2018
At the campus culture festival of Dalian University of Technology,we broadcast IGEM program introduction videos and distributed flyers.In addition, we organized a number of events to attract people and expand team influence.
A " Knowledge contest ": We selected relevant questions about synthetic biology and hyperuricemia and held a knowledge contest which attracted many biological enthusiasts ranging from primary school students to senior citizens, therefore ,more people pay attention to synthetic biology and fall in love with it
B “Questionnaire”: Taking gout as an example, we designed a questionnaire to investigating the general public's understanding of hyperuricemia / gout.
In the end, we recycled more than 200 valid questionnaires.
C "Do you know bacteria? ": There are all kinds of microorganisms around us.With disposable culture dishes of different sizes, we allowed people to print things such as keys, mobile phone cases, and palms on the culture dish and bring them home to cultivate them so that they can visually know how many microbes are around you. During the event, visitors were eager to try and learned that not all microbes are harmful to the human body, and they have a new understanding of the biology profession.
D "Microscopic world":It is well known that organisms include plant, animal and microorganisms.In order to give people a deeper understanding of biology, we have collected a number of permanent sections such as plant tissue sections, microbial sections, etc. what’s more, we provided microscopes for public observation. Many pupils at the scene were amazed at the world displayed in the microscope and showed great interest in biology. In this case everyone can feel the charm of the micro world.
Established the high school Igem community
By DLUT_China HP group Sep 2018
We have established a long-term relationship with the high school affiliated to Dalian University of Technology, where we have established an iGEM club. We offer regular interactive lessons for club members. Below are the specific arrangements for the course.
High school teaching schedule
In the first few lessons, we introduced them to the iGEM competition, synthetic biology and our projects. They showed great enthusiasm for IGEM competition and synthetic biology. In the classroom, we added brainstrom to maximize their inspiration. We also added a literature search course to encourage them to search and understand the cutting-edge biology they are interested in. In addition, we plan to conduct basic experimental operation training and other more course plans to enrich their knowledge and master practical learning and research skills.
In the end, the purpose of both of us is to enable the students in the middle school to form a high school igem team to participate in the competition next year.
Insecticide safety
By DLUT_China HP group Sep 2018
We investigated the approval and management of probiotics in different countries.And find that in China, there is no separate regulation or management method for the safety and quality control of edible fungicides, and the quality of products on the market is also uneven.So after the team members’ discussion,we believe that in the future, we can improve relevant regulations in the following aspects：
1)The safety evaluation of probiotics should consider the safety of people with low immunity;
2)How to accurately quantify live probiotics entering and colonizing the intestines;
3)How to simplify laws and regulations to encourage industrial development under the premise of ensuring food safety;
4)How to develop probiotics, product development, and laws and regulations to form a systematic process, and then promote each other and develop together;
5)How to effectively communicate these standards and norms, and build a global system to adapt to the globalization of the probiotic industry.
