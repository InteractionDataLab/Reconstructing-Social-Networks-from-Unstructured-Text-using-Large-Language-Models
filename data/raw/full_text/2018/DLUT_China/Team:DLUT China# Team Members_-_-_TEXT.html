Instructors
S
Jun   Yang  
Associate professor, associate dean, college of Life Science and Technology.
The research direction
1. Study on the structure and function of microbial REDOX enzyme.
2. Biosafety risk assessment.
Professor Yang helped us to contact teachers and doctors who outside the school, and provide us with help in Human practice, helped us test the feasibility of the experimental program, and remind us of the date of the time node.
Lihan  Zi  
Engineer, assistant to the dean of the school of Life Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology
Ms Zi provided us with experimental equipment, experimental materials and experimental sites, remind us of the date of the time node.
Ming bo  Qu  
Research interests: biochemistry and molecular biology
Research interests include insect biochemistry and molecular biology. Through genomics, transcriptome and proteomics, it is found that the insect is involved in chitin metabolism related proteins. Using the methods of biochemistry and molecular biology, these proteins were used as candidate targets of green pesticides to study their biological functions. The biological pesticides with dsRNA or protein as virulence molecules were developed with functional important proteins as targets.
Professor Qu,helped us test the feasibility of the experimental program,             provided us with a guided experimental program.
YuanSheng  Liu  
Dr Liu's research interests are enzymology. He is a knowledgeable and very warm-hearted person.During the competition ,he helped us order experimental materials,             designed gene sequences,          tested the feasibility of the experimental program,            Provided us with a guided experimental program.
