Nanobody
Some cartilage fish such as sharks, rat sharks, etc. have antibodies called Ig-NAR in vivo, which                         consist of only two heavy chains but each has multiple constant domains (Fig. 1A). There is also                         a heavy chain antibody naturally deleted light chain, only two heavy chains, each heavy chain                         has three domains, including a variable domain, so this antibody (natural) has a heavy chain                         variable region Fragments (Fig. 1B), and found that such antibodies are abundant in some                         camelids, such as llamas, glamas, alpacas, llamas, and the like. Comparing hcIgG and Ig-NAR, it                         is not difficult to find that both antibodies use the variable region domain of the heavy chain                         N-terminus to specifically bind antigen, and the crystal structure of this part presents a flat                         shape resembling a football (Fig.2), approximately 2.5 nm in diameter and 4.2 nm in height.                         Antibodies of this size at the nanometer level are called Nanobodies (Nanobody, Nb), and now                         Nanobodies are commonly referred to as immunoglobulins of this hcIgG heavy chain variable region                         domain in camelids.[1]

In vivo catalysis
Because nanobodies can be expressed in prokaryotic expression and have strong stability, we used                         nanobodies instead of traditional antibodies for experiments. However, since the anisotropy of                         the nano-antibody molecules is not obvious, the ability to cause changes in the arrangement of                         liquid crystal molecules is limited. Therefore, we need to perform long-chain modification on                         Nanobodies to increase their ability to respond to liquid crystals.

Here we use a two-plasmid system: insert the Formylglycine-Generating Enzyme(FGE) gene into one                         plasmid; insert the Nanobody gene and the aldehyde-based precursor tag into the other                         plasmid.
Fig.4 FGE specifically recognizes amino acid sequences and catalyzes                                     the process of specific sites
At the same time, FGE can specifically recognize this tag, which in turn catalyzes the oxidation                         of cysteine to the aldehyde group. Thus co-expression of these two plasmids in E. coli yields                         FGE and Nb-Tag, while FGE catalyzes Nb-Tag, and finally we will obtain Nanobodies with                         aldehyde-based labels.[2] In this way, the Nanobodies we obtained have specific labels that are                         not found in all other proteins: aldehyde groups. This greatly simplifies our subsequent                         operations without the need for complicated purification steps; there is no need to worry about                         non-specific reactions; modularization of Nanobodies greatly simplifies the subsequent steps                         while increasing the choice of modification. We tried to bind the Nanobody to C18-NH-NH2 because                         the C18 molecule itself has a good ability to induce liquid crystal molecules. It can be said                         that our work combines the specific binding ability of Nanobodies with the ability to induce                         C18. Our subsequent liquid crystal experiment also proved this.

LCD sensor design
Overview
Recently, liquid crystal sensor, as a novel and unique optical sensor, has the advantages of                         simple structure, low cost, no need for marking and portability, and provides a simple and                         sensitive online real-time monitoring platform for biomolecule detection. The liquid crystal                         sensor uses the object to be tested to change the orientation of the vertically aligned liquid                         crystal molecules induced by the surface active molecules (Fig. 6),then making liquid crystal                         optical imaging change, therefore we can complete the detection of the target.

We designed a liquid crystal cell as the observation carrier.First, we modify the slides so that                         they can induce vertical alignment of the liquid crystals, making the initial state of the                         optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell black; at the same time, we modify the slides so that                         they can be attached to the target protein; Then we add the sample to be tested and the antibody                         to the modified slide. Finally, the upper and lower slides are assembled, and then the liquid                         crystal is added. We can observe the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell under the                         microscope to judge the β2 of the detected sample. - MG concentration.
The surface of a plain glass slide substrate was decorated with the mixed self-assembled                         monolayers of N, N-dimethyl-N-octadecyl(3-aminopropyl) trimethoxysilyl chloride (DMOAP) and                         (3-aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APTES) with both long and short alkane thiols (Fig. 7). DMOAP                         is used to induce vertical uniform orientation of liquid crystal molecules. The amino group in                         APTES reacts with an aldehyde group in GA to immobilize β2-MG as a functional molecule. When a                         certain concentration of β2-MG nanobody solution and different concentrations of the β2-MG                         antigen solution to be tested are sequentially added, the β-2-Microglobulin (β2-MG) immobilized                         on the slide is competitively combined with the β2-MG to be tested. The limited reaction site on                         the nanobody, after the substrate-bound β2-MG specifically binds to the β2-MG nanobody, the                         nanobody molecule has a certain spatial stereo structure and molecular size effect, which can                         disturb the orientation of the liquid crystal 5CB molecule. It is arranged in an oblique or                         nearly parallel manner. As the concentration of β2-MG to be measured in the sample changes, the                         amount of the nanobody bound to the substrate also changes, thereby changing the color and                         brightness of the liquid crystal film (Fig. 8) to achieve β2 - Specific detection of MG.

Design of self-assembled film
It has been investigated that the effective birefringence, which is relative to the color and                         brightness of LC ﬁlm, varied with alignment layers. Accordingly, the surface modification of                         substrate is critical for the detection of biomolecules by LC biosensor, in the current process                         of LC biosensor construction. The substrate sensitive membrane was constructed by APTES and                         DMOAP hybrid self-assembly method. The long-chain alkyl chain in DMOAP can induce liquid crystal                         molecules to be oriented in the long-chain direction and arranged vertically. At this time, the                         polarized light cannot pass through the liquid crystal cell, and the optical image is uniform.                         Black pattern. The amino group in APTES reacts with an aldehyde group in GA to immobilize                         biomolecules as functional molecules. Since APTES is a short-chain alkyl group, liquid crystal                         molecules cannot be effectively aligned vertically, and background interference can be caused by                         polarized microscope imaging. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the influence of the ratio                         of APTES and DMOAP on liquid crystal orientation, determine the optimal ratio, and on this                         basis, further determine the optimal content of GA.
Using immunocompetitive detection to detect β2-MG
Based on the principle of competitive immunity, the lower the concentration of β2-MG, the more                         β2-MG nano-antibody molecules bound to the substrate surface, the brighter the image; otherwise,                         the higher the concentration of β2-MG, the fewer β2-MG nano-antibody molecules bound to the                         substrate surface, the more black the image tends to be. When the concentration of β2-MG mixed                         with nano-antibody was 400 ng/mL, the optical imaging of liquid crystal was almost uniform black                         pattern (Fig. 9 (a)); when the concentration of β2-MG mixed with nano-antibody was 100 ng/mL,                         the optical imaging of liquid crystal had large area color (Fig. 9 (b)). Therefore, we need to                         design experiments to explore the maximum antigen concentration fixed to the surface of the base                         slide and the most suitable antibody concentration.

According to Jeffrey M. Brake et al, we found that the change of long chain phospholipid                         molecular arrangement induced the change of liquid crystal arrangement when the copper net with                         liquid crystal was covered by phospholipid molecules. According to the commonly used inducers of                         liquid crystal molecules, such as DMOAP, polyimide and other molecules, they are long chain                         structures. Therefore, we speculate that long chain molecules may affect the alignment of liquid                         crystal molecules. Therefore, we designed to increase the sensitivity of liquid crystal                         detection by modifying long chain molecules on ordinary nano-antibodies.

Based on the above principles and designs, we can construct a liquid crystal biosensor. Using a                         competitive immunoassay, we can induce the vertical homogeneous orientation of liquid crystal                         molecules by modifying self-assembled monolayers on the glass substrate to observe the changes                         of color and brightness of the liquid crystal film before and after the binding of β2-MG                         nano-antibodies to β2-MG, and design the liquid crystal through modeling. A non-labeled, highly                         sensitive and specific liquid crystal detector for β2-MG was constructed based on the                         relationship between the color and brightness of the membrane and the concentration of                         β2-MG.
