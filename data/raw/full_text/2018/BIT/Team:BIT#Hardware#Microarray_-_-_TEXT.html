Microarray
We have proposed a microarray chip processing process here because the microarray chip is very suitable for throughput detection. In addition, we shared two optimized microfluidic chip liquid drive methods. We found that the current production process and specific parameters of the chip are rarely mentioned in literatures, which are the key points to determine whether the chip can be used, so we also share the production steps.

Overview
In the biological part, we use aptamers to complete the detection of various disease markers. Because the joint detection of disease markers is very important for the correct rate and reliability of disease diagnosis. For example, h-FABP joint detection cTnI, Mb and CK-Mb has important clinical value in early diagnosis of childrenren with HFMD myocarditis, improvement of the diagnostic rate and lessening of the misdiagnosis rate, et al. [1]
Therefore, in the hardware part, we chose the microarray chip as the detection platform to complete the flux detection of the sample after the reaction. We have proposed two different materials - PMMA based and negative photoresist SU-8 based microarray chip processing. They have their own advantages and can adapt to different testing needs. At the same time, in order to verify that they can achieve basic functions, we have made chips of different sizes and tested them with our device.
So what is a microarray chip? The essence of microarrays is the parallel analysis of biological signals, which concentrates a large amount of biological information on a small solid-phase matrix, so that some traditional biological analysis methods can minimize the consumption of reagents and try to minimize the amount of reagents in the smallest possible space. Fast speed is completed. Fluorescence-based microarray chips provide us with a portable, fast, and high-throughput assay that effectively complements the clinical diagnostic process. As shown in the figure (Fig. 1), a chip that realizes flux detection based on the aperture shape. [2]

PMMA Based Processing Platform
The PMMA flux detection chip can achieve detection requirements for <10 samples. PMMA material, namely polymethyl methacrylate, commonly known as plexiglass, is the highest quality and price-appropriate variety of synthetic transparent materials. Its light transmittance is as high as 93%, which is friendly to fluorescence detection.
At present, we have designed three sizes of chips, each chip has a total size of 30 × 30mm, and the height is determined by the thickness of the acrylic. In use, the reacted biological sample is injected into the chip, and each chip can be used to detect a plurality of biological samples. Taking a 9×9mm chip as an example, the chip has a total of 9 liquid passages, one of which is used as a control when used, and the other can detect one sample.
The processing of PMMA chips is relatively simple. If only less than ten disease markers need to be detected, it is more convenient to use PMMA chips. Figure (Fig. 2) is our production process.

Detailed steps to make a PMMA based chip.
Draw a designed chip map using SOLIDWORKS and export it to DXF file format;
Use RDWorksV8 to import the drawn print files into the laser cutting machine.
Place a 2mm thick acrylic plate in the laser cutting machine, set the cutting speed to 5mm/s, start the laser cutting machine, and wait for the chip to be cut.
After cutting the layers of the chip, wash and dry with deionized water;
Arrange, align and align the layers of the chip according to the design;
Clamp the chip with two aluminum plates to make the layers of the chip closely fit together;
Put the aluminum plate and chip into the oven at 170 °C, control the temperature change within ±5 °C, and heat for 14 min.
Take out the heated aluminum plate and chip, and apply a small amount of water to the outside of the aluminum plate with a test tube brush to slowly cool it to a free evaporation state.
Place the cooled aluminum plate and chip in a ventilated place, and then take out the chip after natural air cooling to check whether the bonding is successful. If successful, the chip is completed.
Precautions:
When cutting the chip, complete it as much as possible, and repeating the cutting multiple times may cause the chip cavity error to become larger;
Check whether the layers of the chip are aligned before bonding. Use a small amount of tape when fixing to avoid the indentation on the surface of the chip.
When bonding, pay attention to the stability of the bonding temperature. If the temperature is too low, the bonding may fail. If the temperature is too high, the chip may melt.

SU-8 Based Processing Platform
The SU-8 flux detection chip can achieve detection requirements for 10 to 1000 samples. We made microchip chips based on solid particles. The principle of flux detection is very simple. The area is divided on the microarray chip, and the shape of the holes of each piece is different. Each shape of the hole can only accommodate the solid particles of the corresponding shape. Before the test, it is only necessary to process different samples to be tested into gel particles of a specific shape in a certain step.
If you need to detect the detection of multiple disease markers, it is more convenient to use the SU-8 chip. Figure (Fig. 4) is our production process.

Additional Work
Microfluidic technology, also known as Lab on a chip , requires only a small amount of sample and reagents and automates the reaction compared to traditional laboratories. In recent years, more and more iGEM teams have chosen to use microfluidic chips to make portable low-cost hardware[3].
However, the size, weight and cost of these instruments are often limited by liquid drive modules. The common liquid driving methods for microfluidic chips are peristaltic pump, air pump and vacuum pump. These pumps need to be connected to large external devices, making the instrument too bulky and unsuitable for promotion. In order to optimize the liquid driving method of the microfluidic chip, at the beginning of the project setting, we proposed two solutions through brainstorming, namely electromagnetic driving based on electromagnet and driving method of integrated peristaltic pump. We have completed the preliminary design and parameter exploration of the chip under the two schemes, hoping to bring some help to the team that might use the microfluidic chip.
Fig.7 Two o optimized liquid drive methods.(a)Electromagnetic drive;(b)Integrated peristaltic pump.
Electromagnetic drive
3.1 Driving principle:
The electromagnet is placed on the top of each chamber on the chip. When the electromagnet is energized, the magnetic film layer under the chamber is electromagnetically attracted upward. The liquid in the chip can be driven by controlling the three-phase peristalsis of the magnetic film layer. [4]
3.2 Structural design:
The chip is mainly divided into three materials:
PMMA layer, PDMS-CI mixed layer and pure PDMS layer: The PDMS-CI layer is a magnetic film layer, which is mainly made of CI and PDMS. It is one of the electromagnetically driven control elements and will be control liquid drive under the action of electromagnet. The pure PDMS layer is the main constituent material of the chip, which is used to implement various preset functions in the chip, and the PMMA layer is used for supporting the PDMS chip body.

[5];(b) From top to bottom is fixed layer, top layer, support layer, magnetic film layer, fixed layer; (c)The mask diagram of the chip design.
3.3 Advantages and disadvantages:
Advantages: Compared to conventional peristaltic pump drives, electromagnetic drives are less expensive and smaller. The basic liquid drive can be achieved by simple electromagnetic action. In addition, the combination of the electromagnet and the magnetic film can also be used for the design of the solenoid valve to controlle the channel switch.
Disadvantages: The chamber size parameter of the chip has a great influence on the liquid driving effect, and the parameter exploration is more complicated. The PDMS-CI hybrid membrane production process is complicated and takes a long time. In addition to this, electromagnetic interference will also affect the experimental results.
3.4 Detailed steps to make the chip
3.4.1. Making CI-PDMS film
1) Add a 2:1 mass ratio CI powder and PDMS prepolymer to the centrifuge tube for thorough mixing and then add and mix the PDMS: curing agent mass ratio of 15:1 (curing agent density close to 1).
2) Vacuum pumping using a vacuum pump
3) Turn off the vacuum pump, deflate, and evacuate
4) Open the vacuum pump Check the operation of the silicone machine Note the change file
5) Use a clean piece of silicon (be careful not to touch the surface with your hand) into the  spin coater . Pour the vacuum-filled CI-PDMS mixed glue on it (note the amount of control).
6) After the silicone is finished, place the silicon wafer on the foil paper, put it into a 60 ° C heating box, and heat it for 1 hour.
3.4.2 Make CI-PDMS&PDMS mixed layer and support layer
1) Remove the CI-PDMS film from the wafer and flatten it on the foil
2) Use a 8mm round punch to punch 6 holes on the foil paper
3) Align the holes according to the desired position and place them on top of the mask that has been cut.
4) The mask is reversed and the CI-PDMS layer magnetic film on the mask is attached to the silicon wafer in the original position (note the position of the entire chip)
5) Configure PDMS: curing agent = 10:1 mixture and vacuum (can be operated in parallel with step 4)
6) Place the silicon wafer with the CI-PDMS layer attached to the corresponding position of the silicone machine and pour it into the PDMS to wait for its bubbles to disappear  and is placed in a 60 ° C heating box for 1 h.
7) Add some PDMS to another silicon wafer, wait for the bubbles to disappear, and put them in a 90 °C heating box for 1 hour.
3.4.3 First bond
1) Remove the pure PDMS layer from the silicon wafer with a blade and then buckle it on the foil that has been masked.
2) Remove the extra parts
3) Cover the PDMS layer that needs plasma with tin foil and put it into the plasma cleaner for plasma cleaning.
4) After completing 3), return to the ultra-clean workbench, reverse the layer covered with silicon wafer, and then align the holes, and then bond them. After bonding, the silicon wafers are placed in a 90 °C heating box for 30 minutes, then removed spare.
3.4.4 Channel layer fabrication, second bonding
1) Wrap the channel layer mold with tin foil paper, pour the glue (pay attention to the dosage), put it into the 90 °C heating box and heat it for 1h30min after the bubble disappears, then take it out ( step 4 should start within 30min after step 2 )
2) The 3-step spare bonded part is opposite to the 4-step channel layer chip, plasma-cleaned after plasma plasma cleaning, and then bonded after the chamber is aligned.
2) After heating, put it in a 60 ° C heating box for 1 h, remove, and the experiment is complete
Integrated design of peristaltic pump
4.1Working principle of traditional peristaltic pump:
A peristaltic pump consists of a motor-driven wheel with peripherally placed rollers and an adjustable compression cam (or band) which is squeezed against the rollers. One or several pump tubes are affixed so that they rest on a minimum of two rollers at all times . The successive peristaltic movements of the tubes force various fluids through the tubes[6]
Fig.11 Schematic diagram of the working principle of peristaltic pump[6]
4.2 Chip design:
With reference to the traditional peristaltic pump construction, we integrate the rotor and hose into the inside of the chip. The driving part is composed of a rotor, a hose and a nut, wherein the nut is a bonding point of the chip and the screwdriver. Rotating the nut with a stepper motor control screwdriver can drive the rotation of the rotor. When the rotor rotates, it squeezes the hose and drives the liquid to flow.
4.3 Advantages and disadvantages:
Advantages: Compared with the electromagnetic interference that may exist in electromagnetic driving, the magnetic strength is difficult to quantify, etc., the integrated peristaltic pump has fewer potential influencing factors, better working stability, short manufacturing cycle and mature process.
Disadvantages: The volume of the integrated peristaltic pump chip is relatively affected by the driving area, and the function is not as flexible as the electromagnetic driving function. The micro-valve is required to complete the control of the liquid flow.
