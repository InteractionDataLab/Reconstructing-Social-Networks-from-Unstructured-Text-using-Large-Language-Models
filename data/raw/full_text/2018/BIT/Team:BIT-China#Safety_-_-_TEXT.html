SAFETY
Every member of our team has been trained about general lab safety and project design safety by our                     previous members. For example, the former leader and our advisors taught us how to run the                     experiment correctly and avoid mistakes.
PROJECT DESIGN SAFETY
For the safety of our team members, we designed the project to be as safe as possible. The core                         of our project is to accumulate intracellular ROS by overexpressing the endogenous ndi1 gene of                         Saccharomyces cerevisiae. And in order to improve yeast survival, we use a feedback system to                         maintain intracellular ROS at an appropriate level. The entire project is harmless to the human body. During the implementation of the project, we selected the roGFP2-Orp1 fusion protein as a                         reporter gene, which can be directly detected without adding any harmful reagents.
LAB SAFETY
Our team conducted research in a safety level 1/2 laboratory. The organisms we used, E. coli                         strain DH5α, BL21, Top 10 and S.c strain CEN.PK2-1C are suitable for the S1/2-safety laboratory                         we are working in. Besides, the plasmids we are using for transformation (pRS42K, pESC-Ura,                         pESC-Trp, pESC-His, pESC-Leu, pSB1C3) are not harmful for humans.

Because of the nature of our project, contacting with microorganisms is inevitable. In order to                         avoid any harmful effects to each member of our team, all laboratory work was in accordance                         with the safety requirements for the laboratory. This includes, but is not limited to, the                         following examples:
(1) Eating, drinking and smoking are prohibited in the laboratory.
(2) Don’t deal with the wastes at will.
(3) All experimenters must wear protective equipment such as gloves and Lab coats.
(4) All equipments that come into contact with biological material (such as tips and glass                             glassware) must be autoclaved.
(5) Store quick-burning, flammable materials in designated locations which are away from                             ignition sources for fire protection. And there is no accumulated clutter in the hallway,                             for our safety while accident happening.
Laboratory for experiments, seminar rooms for research and discussion, and the office used                             to search for information and analyze data are rigorously divided. These provisions are                             intended to prevent the possibility of unnecessary cross-contamination in the laboratory.
DANGEROUS CHEMICALS
We tried to avoid the use of dangerous chemicals whenever possible. We have completely banned a                         number of dangerous chemicals, such as ethidium bromide which had been replaced by anthocyanin                         for our DNA gel electrophoresis. At the same time, we have restricted the use of dangerous                         chemicals (such as acrylamide) which must be clearly placed in marked areas in the laboratory. And we were also required to keep the chemistry reagents in classified storage.
