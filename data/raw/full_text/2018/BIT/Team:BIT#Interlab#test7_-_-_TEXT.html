WARNING! Do not move any files from the folder, this may lead to missing file errors. ASSETS All textures are included in the archive. You can also find pre-rendered reveals. They are made to shorten render time significantly. Corresponding comps will contain all source layers, so you can edit them if needed. Free font used in preview (Uni Sans) http://www.fontfabric.com/uni-sans-free/ Audio file from preview (TimMcMorris This Is My Year) - http://audiojungle.net/item/this-is-my- year/10030944?_ga=1.227192413.1703263272.1440445186 CUSTOMIZATION OPEN PROJECT FILE Install font that was used in the preview. Use After Effects version CS5.5 and higher to open the project file. Ignore error message that pops out when the project is opened with later versions of AE. IMPORT YOUR FILES To import your footages, double click on project panel and choose the file. Or you can drag and drop them directly from a folder. Make sure that your logo has a transparent background. The imported audio file should be placed into “MAIN COMP”. INSERT FOOTAGES AND EDIT TEXT LINES Start by choosing your project length (SHORT or LONG). Open “MAIN COMP” that you will use. In the project panel, you can find all “Footage” placeholders from “MAIN COMPS” folder. Double click on one of them to open. Drag your footage into the comp, position and scale it to fit composition sizes. Do the same for other “Footage” comps. Next, navigate to project panel and find “Text” comps. Open them and edit text layers by double-clicking and typing new text. CHANGE BRUSH REVEAL TYPE To change one of the reveals for Footage or Text, you need to navigate into “Placeholder” and “Title” comps, from there select all “Reveal” layers and by holding “Alt” , drag another “Reveal” comp or pre-rendered footage above selected layers. I would recommend using pre-render files, this will make your renders much shorter. Also, make sure that “Footage” or “Text” comp layer is scaled and positioned to fit into “Reveal” area. EDIT TIMINGS If you want to stay on an image longer or maybe make animations faster, you will need to edit keyframes from “Camera controller” layer. Select it and press “U” to show keyframes. If you want to pause on a frame, you will need to duplicate the keyframe and move it to make the pause longer. After that, you will also need to move other keyframes to retain animation durations, and reposition compositions on the timeline. CHANGE COLORS Colors for both SHORT and LONG versions are editable from “MAIN COMP (SHORT)”. Select “Global Controls” layer and edit colors from there. CREATE YOUR OWN BRUSH REVEALS As a navigation point, you can use “Brush Library” composition. Select required brushes and copy/paste them into the new comp. Then you need to position and scale brushes to create interesting animations. Use puppet tools “Ctrl+P” to select puppet points and change brush curve. RENDER From “MAIN COMP” press Ctrl+M to add this comp to render queue. Choose output format and press Render.
