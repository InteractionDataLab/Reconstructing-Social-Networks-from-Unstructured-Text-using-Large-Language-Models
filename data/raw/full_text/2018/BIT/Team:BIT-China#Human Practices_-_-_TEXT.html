INTEGRATED HUMAN                     PRACTICES
Purpose
Brainstorm
In order to make sure that we have enough time to a better preparation, we started recruiting                         players in mid-March. We hold a group meeting every week to conduct "Brain Storm". In the first                         few weeks, everyone can come up with his or her own interesting ideas. After a few weeks'                         "Storm", we identified the final project purpose. After that, we started with different entry                         points according our purpose, reviewed a large number of literature and reviews, and reported                         them regularly. At the same time, we realized that we needed to make sure our project is                         meaningful for the society. Therefore, we did some surveys.
Survey
During Brainstorm, we basically determined that this year we want to build a cell-detector of                         antioxidants. In order to evaluate whether this has the significance of implementation and                         whether it is the core of people's attention, we conducted some surveys.
We designed a questionnaire about antioxidant products and the way to test them. And we also                         tried to clarify whether the public is familiar with synthetic biology.
After the investigation, we gained a lot. We were very glad that more and more people around us                         knew and started to pay attention to synthetic biology and had a strong interest in                         biotechnology. This really excited us. As for the part about antioxidants, we also had some                         positive results. According to what we learned, about 60.77% of people had used products                         contains antioxidants, such as vitamin C, astaxanthin capsules. However, most people questioned                         whether these products really have antioxidant effects. And they hoped to establish a set of                         antioxidants detection method in living cells so that it can be more accurate and efficient. At                         the same time, about 89.3% of the people made clear that the establishment of this kind of                         system will be helpful when choosing antioxidants products.
This was a very meaningful investigation. It not only gave us confidence in executing our idea,                         but also helped us established the purpose of our project.

Meetups
Meetup held by ITCCC
On July 24th, we were invited to take part a meeting upheld by International                         Teenager                         Competition and Communication Center on campus of USTB, during which 4 teams shared the                         experimental process about their project and feelings of iGEM. We made a brief introduction to                         our project and answered questions asked by experts and journalist, in which we gained a better                         insight into our project.
Meetup held by team Peking
We participated in an exchange meeting organized by team Peking. The other teams are team                         Tsinghua, UCAS, BNU, THU, OUC. Every team had a presentation on their projects, including the                         idea, the process, and their superiority. We received a lot of pertinent suggestions from other                         teams, which helped a lot to our project. Especially, team Peking gave us plenty of suggestions                         and we had a pleasant discussion. Due to these, we set a collaboration with team Peking.
CCIC
By the end of August, we had preliminarily completed all parts of experimental verification,                         constructed the relevant proteins, and verified the strength of each promoter. In order to                         further improve our project and make progress with other teams from communication, we                         participated in CCIC. CCIC (Central China iGEM Consortium) is a national iGEM exchange meeting                         held by domestic universities, which provides an important pre-competition exchange and                         learning platform for teams from China. It not only promotes the exchange and cooperation                         between the national iGEM teams, but also further promote synthetic biology to domestic                         universities. Taking part in CCIC allowed us to have a more profound understanding of our own                         project, so as to find some improving thoughts, and a few other teams reached a friendly cooperation on the project design with our team. Through the expert's reports and several                         predecessors experience exchange, we had solved many confusion in our laboratory, and had a                         deeper understanding of synthetic biology.
Excuction
COFCO
In mid-August, we completed several gene building and testing. COFCO, one of the world's top                         500 companies with a good reputation in the international grain and oil food market, became our                         first interviewee. The meeting had three parts. Firstly, we introduced our project to the                         COFCO. Then, they asked us some questions about the project. After that, we asked them about                         the market of current antioxidant products. Through communication, we learned that the sales of                         anti-oxidant products are on the rise, and more and more people are pursuing anti-oxidant and                         anti-aging products. Therefore, we have more reasons to believe that our project has a good                         application prospect in the market. We would do our best to make the project more reasonable                         and more beneficial to the world.
Wehand-bio
In order to figure out what we can do by our system, we visited Wehand-bio, a leading                         innovative pharmaceutical company in Beijing. During the meeting, we gave a brief introduction                         of our design to show the idea of our living antioxidant detection device, and they talked                         about their current research. After the discussion, we found that there is another application                         of antioxidants which is used in medicines. As they told us, almost all of the medicines would use antioxidants to prevent oxidation of medicines. So our system could also be applied in                         pharmaceutical production. What’s more, they offered us a good idea about testing whether the                         natural antioxidant products will deteriorate in quality over time. As you can see, this                         discussion had let us take a deeper look at how to use our system more widely.
