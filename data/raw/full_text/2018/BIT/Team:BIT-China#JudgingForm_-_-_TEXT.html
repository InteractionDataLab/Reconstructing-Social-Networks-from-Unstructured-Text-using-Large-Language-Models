We have completed communication with the World's Top                             Five Hundred food company COFCO and pharmaceutical enterprise Wehand-bio, whose researchers                             have given professional advice on our project and improved it.
2. Improve                             a previous part.
We                             optimized Connell team’s previous part BBa_K2296006 and                                 obtained our core part BBa_K2296006 which can produce redox-sensitive Green                             fluorescent protein roGFP2-Orp1 and display ROS content in cells by its fluorescence ratio.
3. Model                                 our project.
We                                 established three models, H2O2 Decomposition Model , Fluorescent Probe Model and roGFP2-Orp1 Michaelis equation Model , which can the convert                             the extracellular H2O2 concentration, fluorescence intensity of                             DFCH-DA probe and                             fluorescence intensity of roGFP2-orp1 protein into the intracellular H2O2 concentration.
4.                                 Our                                 system can work.
This year, we created a detecting system for antioxidants. It is unprecedented to solve                             this difficult problem by synthetic biological strategy.
See                                 our results page. Our system gave a similar result to CAA assay in three selected antioxidant tests，which proves our system can detect the antioxidant in living cell successfully!
Special prize
This year, we want to fight for the Best Applied Design Special Prize.
Oxidation damage, aging and relative diseases are global concerns which highly relate to human health and the sole treatment is antioxidant. However, detection approaches to antioxidant are                         quite limited, especially those for the living-cells. Traditional methods focused more on                         direct redox reaction which may have non-proper navigation to living systems. Living cells are                         integrated with multiple natural anti-oxidant systems, including anti-oxidant enzyme system,                         reductive system, post-damage repair system and etc, which makes it sophisticated to evaluate                         real effects from exogenous antioxidant. The distinctions in living cells make some huge cost                         on dining antioxidant senseless. To solve this real-world problem, a corresponding “living                         antioxidant detection device” was built via synthetic biology manners this year. Yeast was set                         as our host cell as it can present a simple but accurate measuring platform for us. Then, we                         constructed multiple functional gene circuits to implement ROS regulating, endogenous redox                         reaction testing, feedback regulation and so on. Our goal is to make it easily, accurately,                         fast and economically to detect antioxidant, and contribute to world real feasible                         antioxidants.
Parts
Introduce our favorite parts for you.
Best new basic part
BBa_K2765021 ,                         this guy can increase the intracellular ROS content through overexpressing                         yno1 gene. He has replaced the position of artificial synthetic oxyradical in the previous                         antioxidant detection methods. We can’t start detecting without he.
Best New Composite Part
BBa_K2765052 ,                         this girl can express redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein roGFP2-Orp1 which can display                         ROS content in cells by its fluorescence ratio. She plays the role of signal output in our                         system and has replaced the position of chemical probe. She has helped us save a lot of money                         for fluorescent probes. Thank her.
Best Part Collection
BBa_K2765050 , BBa_K2765051 , BBa_K2765052 , BBa_K2765053 .                         This family is our brilliant part collection.
In our system, we used roGFP2-Orp1, which can reflect the ROS level in cell immediately through                         the rate of the concentration of two kinds of protein states, as our signal output. But                         according to this measurement principle, the concentration of whole roGFP2-Orp1 can effect the                         final signal output strength, even detect the same sample. So, we built a series of gene                         circuits with different transcription level promoters to express roGFP2-Orp1 and hoped to solve                         this interfere. Four common promoters were chosen, FBA1, TEF2, TEF1, ENO2. We tested four gene                         circuits and found different promoters could work as expected. Considering the application of                         our system in the future, we made this collection of these four parts and wished these parts                         can be used in different antioxidant detection.
