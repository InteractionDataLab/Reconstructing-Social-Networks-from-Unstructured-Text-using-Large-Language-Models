We modified the sequence of the promoter BBa_I14018 , and got the promoter BBa_K2708009.
Then we assembled these two promoter with repoter BBa_E0840 and transforming plasmid to Ecoli DH5Î±, measuring green fluorescence to characterize the effect of the promoter.
The figure below is the fluorescence results we measured in the eighth hour of culture. Excitation and emission are 480nm and 520nm, E0840 is the negative control. The results show that the promoter K2708009 has a stronger starting ability than I14018.
