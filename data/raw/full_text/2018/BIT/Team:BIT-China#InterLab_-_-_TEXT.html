Introduction
Interlab is aimed to improve reproducibility and compare the difference between laboratories.                         To complete this job,we make three sets of unit calibration measurements: an OD600 reference                         point, a particle standard curve, and a fluorescein standard curve. Completion of the                         calibrations will ensure that we understand the measurement process and that we can take the                         cell measurements under the same conditions. For the sake of consistency and reproducibility,                         we used E. coli K-12 DH5-alpha like other teams. Later, we conducted the CFU experiment.                         We                         count colonies for our two Positive Control (BBa_I20270) cultures and two Negative Control                         (BBa_R0040) cultures.
Methods
—— OD 600 Reference point - LUDOX Protocol
We use LUDOX CL-X (45% colloidal silica suspension) as a single point reference to obtain a                         conversion factor to transform your absorbance (AbS600) data from our plate reader                         into a                         comparable OD600 measurement.
$$ Correction\ factor=\frac{ReferenceOD_{600}}{reading_{LUDOX CL-X}-reading_{H_2 O}} $$
—— Particle Standard Curve - Microsphere Protocol
We prepare a dilution series of monodisperse silica microspheres and measure the AbS600 in our                         plate reader. This measurement allow us to construct a standard curve of particle concentration                         which can be used to convert Abs600 measurements to an estimated number of cells.

——Fluorescence standard curve - Fluorescein                         Protocol
We will prepare a dilution series of fluorescein in four replicates and measure the                         fluorescence in a 96 well plate in our plate reader. By measuring these in our plate reader,we                         generate a                         standard curve of fluorescence for fluorescein concentration. Thus we are able to use this to                         convert our cell based readings to an equivalent fluorescein concentration.

—— Cell measurement protocol
For all of these cell measurements, we use the same plates and volumes that we used in our                         calibration protocol. For the first time,we have measurements that are off scale (“OVERFLOW”),                         so we adjust our settings to make the data in range. Finally, we get the right data.

——Protocol: Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E.                             coli cultures
This procedure is used to calibrate OD600 to colony forming unit (CFU) counts, which are                         directly relatable to the cell concentration of the culture. For the CFU protocol, we count                         colonies for our two Positive Control (BBa_I20270) cultures and two Negative Control                         (BBa_R0040) cultures.
