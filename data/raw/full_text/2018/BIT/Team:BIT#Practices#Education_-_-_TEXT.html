Education & public engagement
In the Education & Public engagement section, this year, we mainly completed the explanation and presentation of synthetic biology knowledge and iGEM  for students from three different ages group, middle school, high school and university.
Junior high school:
we went to Beijing Fangshan District Hope Primary School on a sunny afternoon for about 1 hour to explain the knowledge of synthetic biology.
Not only did we unilaterally introduce the students there about synthetic biology, we also used the principle of flipping the classroom. Divided the children into five groups and gave them 10 min time to read the material we giving and let them talk about the use of synthetic biology in life.
When we explained that synthetic biology is "the most basic element of building components step by step," a child raised his innocent face and asked us, "Is synthetic biology the same as Lego building blocks?" Is it possible to connect a little bit?"
We were surprised that the children had made synthetic biology more figurative and easier to understand.
We were given an opportunity to carry out a seminar in the senior school affiliated to the Beijing institute of technology. We gave lectures and shared sessions on synthetic biology to students from all three grades. We started by playing a video of an iGEM team's simple explanation of synthetic biology on YouTube, so that they can understand the concept of synthetic biology in a very simple way.
As we went on, we explained synthetic biology in a more professional way and handed out our introductory folding. At the end of the activity we also got good feedback from questionnaire of this lecture,students raised some fun questions also. We have completed the initial period of knowledge introduction, so this time we want  to make something different, for the students who study synthetic biology need long and continuous period of time.So we design a app for students to learn and browsing about synthetic biology, iGEM, and related knowledge introduction together with website recommendation. The enthusiasm of the students is so high that we get good feedback as below.
In fact, this App is more than a program. Our design for it is not only a simple introduction, but a platform for resource exchange and sharing. We will provide lab visits and iGEM training registration opportunities and simple basic knowledge testing in this program. It provides opportunities for high school students to study at a higher level. In the future, we would like to contact the high school affiliated to Beijing institute of technology about the promotion of this App
College: we arrived at another campus early with folding pages and posters, where we gave street lectures for the whole school.
Perhaps because we are an English poster, or because we are wearing uniform clothes, many people come to our posters and listen to us with interest.
Many freshmen were interested in synthetic biology and asked us in details about the information on posters and folding pages, and we answered their questions patiently.
