OUTPUT
To sense intracellular ROS content and express its changes quickly and                     intuitively, we constructed roGFP2-orp1 fusion protein and optimized it.
Increase the sensitivity of roGFP2 to hydrogen                     peroxide
Overview
We made codon optimization of roGFP2 gene sequences and constructed RoGFP2-Orp1 fusion protein                         to make roGFP2 more sensitive to the REDOX state of cells.
Specific methods:
First, we obtained the gene sequence of roGFP2 from the part:BBa_K2296006: Constitutive                         Promoter-RBS-roGFP2-Orp1 C82S and codon optimized it for our chassis organisms---yeast, in                         anticipation of better expression in yeast.
Second, we synthesized the codon-optimized roGFP2+linker sequence, obtained the sequence                         of Orp1 from the yeast genome and ligated them by OE-PCR. This enhances the specificity of                         roGFP2 for recognizing hydrogen peroxide and increases its sensitivity to H2O2.                         After that, we completed the 82nd cysteine point mutation (C82S), which made our signal output                         more responsive.

Select the suitable promoter and verify the function                     of the gene
Overview:
After optimizing the most important detector component roGFP2-orp1, we need to construct it                         into yeasts modified in regulator and feedback part. In order to make roGFP2-orp1 in a suitable                         redox state, we chose several promoters of different intensity and ligated them to roGFP2-orp1                         through OE-PCR, then adding hydrogen peroxide to verify its function.
Specific method:
First, we obtain seven promoters of different intensity from Saccharomyces yeast genome through                         enzyme digestion method. They are: FBA1,TEF1,TEF2,ENO2,PCK1,PDC1 and PGI1. [1]
Second, we linked the promoter fragment to the previously constructed fragment roGFP2-orp1by                         OE-PCR and constructed it on the pESC-Trp plasmid. We screened positive results in the                         following of digestion，ligation and transformation of the large intestine. Finally, we                         constructed the fragments into our chassis organisms through yeast transformation.

Result & discussion
The response of roGFP2-Orp1 to H2O2
According to literature[2], roGFP2-Orp1 green fluorescent protein shows peak value                         at 405nm (oxidation peak) and 488nm (reduction peak). Fluorescence ratio R (R=I408 / I488) is                         uesed to the redox degree of roGFP2-Orp1. Therefore, we used different H2O2 concentrations (independent variable) to simulate the accumulation of ROS in cells and the                         fluorescence ratio (dependent variable) to characterize the redox degree of roGFP2-Orp1, which                         means that the increase of fluorescence ratio R shows roGFP2-Orp1 is oxidized and the decrease                         shows reduction.
Fig.7 Experimental Group
As Figure.7 shown, the fluorescence ratio R of roGFP2-Orp1 increases with the increase of H2O2 concentration. And the fluorescence ratio is basically unchanged when the concentration of H2O2 exceeds 0.8 mM.
Fig.8 Control Group
As Figure.8 shown, the fluorescence ratio of wide-type was not affected by the change of H2O2 concentration and remained unchanged.
Redox reversibility of roGFP2-Orp1
Firstly, we made the cells almost be oxidation state by adding 1 mM H2O2 and observed the change of fluorescence ratio R (dependent variable) with time (independent                         variable).
Fig.9 Verify Redox Reversibility of roGFP2-Orp1
As Figure.9 shown, the fluorescence ratio R decreased slightly in the range of 0 to 20 mins,                         because cell itself has the mechanism of scavenging ROS and H2O2 will                         decompose spontaneously. At the 23 mins, we added DTT (strong reducing agent) with the final                         concentration of 5 mM. As a result, the fluorescence ratio R decreased significantly.
Therefore, the redox of our roGFP2-Orp1 is reversible.
Codon optimization of roGFP2-Orp1
Determinate the DTT concentration making                         roGFP2-Orp1 completely reduced.
We added three different concentrations of DTT, 0.5 mM, 3 mM and 5 mM. When DTT was added, the                         roGFP2-Orp1 should be reduced and the fluorescence ratio R should decrease.
Fig.10 Relationship Between R and DTT Concentration (After Codon Optimization)
Fig.11 Relationship Between R and DTT Concentration (Before Odon Optimization)
As shown, when the concentration of DTT was 3 mM, the fluorescence ratio R was no longer                         decreased with the increase of the DTT concentration. At that time, the cells were in reduced                         state completely.
roGFP2-Orp1 protein expression before and after                         codon optimization.
To exclude the influence of individual differences, we made cell be in the same state of redox                         by adding 5mM DTT. In that case, roGFP2-Orp1 proteins were in the complete reduction state.                         Fluorescence intensity can characterize protein expression and we used fluorescence / OD600 to approximate the expression protein of roGFP2-Orp1 in single cell.

As Figure.12~Figure.15 shown, codon optimized roGFP2-Orp1 had higher expression protein than                         control group without codon optimization and wide-type without fluorescent protein.
Therefore, the codon optimization improved the roGFP2-Orp1 protein expression successfully.
