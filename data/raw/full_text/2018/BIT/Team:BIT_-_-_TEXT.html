JACOB 2.0
Just A Creative assay for detection Of Biomarkers
BIT-dedication makes perfection.
We, team BIT, are constantly seeking to revolutionize diagnosis through synthetic biology and engineering. Since 2015 our first show at iGEM, we had already built 4 prototypes that attacked pressing issues in unique angles, including ‘breast cancer detection’ and 'Disease Alarm'. Most importantly, we revisit each project to maximize its performance and further its influence. Last year we brought the project JACOB, an integrated biosensor of bacteria engineering, aptamer, and microfluidic technology. Today we present you JACOB 2.0, a new-gen diagnostic device with major upgrades. Come and take a look!
