REGULATOR
Overview
Previously we showed how we design the whole system, now we are going to tell you how we                             achieve them steps by steps:
Regulator
To increase the accumulation of endogenous ROS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and                             to improve the tolerance of yeast to high levels of ROS, we optimized our yeast, which will                             be shown as follow:
Increase the accumulation of endogenous ROS
Overview:
After literature searching, we selected two genes, yno1 and ndi1, as candidates                         for overexpression to increase the accumulation of endogenous ROS. According to our data, both                         of these two genes can effectively increase the accumulation of endogenous ROS.
To determine whether overexpression of ndi1 or yno1 can increase the endogenous                         ROS accumulation in yeast, we constructed an expression plasmid, based on pESC-Leu, in which                         the cloned ndi1 or yno1 is driven by GAL1 promoter. Thus the target gene can be                         induced by galactose and repressed by glucose.
Fig. 1,2 Transformed the plasmid into yeast
After transformed the plasmid into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we first measured the ROS                         production of yeast cells cultured in non-screening or screening media by Fluorescent                         microplate reader. We mixed yeast cells with DCFH-DA, which can be oxidized by ROS to become a                         strong green fluorescent substance DCF (dichlorofluorescein) that cannot penetrate the cell                         membrane.
Fig. 3,4 results of ROS accumulation through overexpress yno1 or ndi1
Fluorescent microplate reader analysis showed that overexpression of either ndi1 or yno1 may cause significant ROS production as revealed by green fluorescent substance DCF, and the                         fluorescence intensity in ndi1-overexpressing cells was a liitle bit higher than tat in yno1-overexpressing cells.
we performed three times in YPD medium and three times in SD-Leu-deficient medium. A time                         period of 0h-48h was selected and detected once every four hours. After excluding some                         experimental operational errors, we obtained the results in the figure.
It has been shown that external NADH dehydrogenases Ndi1 and Yno1 are involved                         in the generation of intracellular oxidative stress, however, the results measured by the                         fluorescence microplate reader cannot exclude the interference of dead cells on OD600, we                         therefore examined the ROS accumulation through flow cytometry.

Replace the                             promoter of yno1/ndi1 in yeast genome
In order to reduce the pressure on our engineered strains from the addition of plasmid and to                         prevent plasmid loss, we decided to introduce the gene circuit which increases the level of                         endogenous ROS into the yeast genome. We chose to replace the ndi1/yno1 promoter with                         the galactose-inducible promoter GAL1p we used. Because the promoter of the endogenous ndi1/yno1 gene in yeast is a bidirectional promoter, we chose to insert the gal1 promoter upstream of the ndi1/yno1 gene by OE-PCR.
Fig.6 Replace the promoter of yno1/ndi1
After successfully replacing the promoter of the yeast endogenous ndi1/yno1 gene,                         to obtain the overexpression effect, we tested the mRNA quantity. The results are as follows.
Fig.7 qPCR result in original strain (C, in blue below), and in strain with yno1 overexpressed and yca1 knockout (YY, in red below).
Fig.8 qPCR result in original strain (C, in blue below), and in strain with yno1 overexpressed and ndi1 knockout (YN, in red below).
According to the result, we could find out that strain with yno1 overexpressed and yca1 knockout had an obvious increase of mRNAs. However, we didn't get the same result in ndi1                         overexpressed strain. We believed this result showed that the overexpression of ndi1 was                         failed while the yno1 one succeeded.
Improve the tolerance to high levels of ROS
Overview:
To block the response of yeast to ROS, we knocked out the yeast-derived yca1 gene. Because Yca1                         is the only known yeast metacaspase, to demonstrate genetically that Ndi1 functions                         independently of Yca1, we overexpressed Ndi1 in yca1 mutant background. Consistently,Ndi1                         overexpression exacerbated cell death in the absence of Yca1

Based on the result, we determined that there was no mistake in the process of knocking out yca1 gene and that the yca1 gene was knocked out indeed.
verify whether knocking out gene yca1 can increase yeast tolerance to H2O2
If the growth of Δyca1 and yno1-Δyca1 was better than that of WT and yno1, it                         can be concluded that knocking out yca1 gene can improve yeast tolerance to H2O2.                         We diluted seed liquid to OD600 at 2, which was Saccharomyces Cerevisiae of overexpressing yno1                         gene and lacking the yca1 gene (yno1-Δyca1) and strains of overexpressing yno1                         gene (yno1) as control group. And then adjust the concentration of H2O2 in the seed                         liquid to 0 mM, 1 mM, and 2 mM respectively. The yeasts were cultured for 16h. Take samples                         every 2-4h. Its OD600 was measured by the ultraviolet spectrophotometer. OD600 reflected a                         growth of yeasts which can judge whether yca1 knockout can improve yeast tolerance to                         H2O2. The results are shown as follow:
Fig.11 Strain Growth Curve under 0mM H2O2 Stress
Fig.12 Strain Growth Curve under 1mM H2O2 Stress
Fig.13 Strain Growth Curve under 2mM H2O2 Stress
Figure.14 The OD600 of strains at 12h under 0mM, 1mM, and 2mM H2O2 Stress stress
As Figure.11~ Figure.14 shown, comparing the growth curves of yno1 and yno1-∆yca1 under H2O2 stress with 0mM, 1mM and 2mM, we can see that, the growth of                         strain knocking out yca1 is always better than the strain without knocking out yca1 after overexpressing yno1.
It can be concluded that knocking out yca1 can improve our engineering strain tolerance                         to H2O2.
Conclusions:
Knock out yca1 gene can increase the yeast tolerance to hydrogen peroxide.
Summary of regulator part
To summarize briefly, overexpress ndi1/yno1 can accumulate ROS successfully, also,                         knocking out gene yca1 can improve the tolerance to high level of ROS content.
