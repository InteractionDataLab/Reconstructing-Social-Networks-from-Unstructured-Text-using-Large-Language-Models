Host cell selection
After literature research, we found that yeast was widely used in aging research for the                         following reasons:
● It has the process of apoptosis, which can accumulate ROS.
Like mammalian cells, yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) undergoing apoptosis                             show                             characteristic markers such as DNA cleavage, apoptosis-typical chromatin condensation,                             externalization of phosphatidylserine, ROS accumulation, and Cytochrome C release                             from                             mitochondria.[1][2][3]
● As unicellular organism and an excellent model of genetics, yeast is useful for oxidation                             research.[4]
● It has a short growth cycle and relatively simple culture conditions. The protocols of                             yeast are mature, too.
Thus, S. cerevisiae constitutes an interesting model for studies of the oxidation process,                         which makes possible experimentation not easily available in higher eukaryotes.
Therefore, we choose it as our host cell. [5]
Regulator
ROS accumulation
As mentioned before, we need to keep yeast under the stress of oxidation.                                 Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS), known as free radicals, play a key role in the aging and disease by creating vascular oxidative stress. Particularly, ROS account for more than 95% of the total free radicals in the human body. In hence we simulated cell oxidation                         state through accumulate ROS to finish the test work. As we mentioned in Background part , ROS are mainly divided into                         four categories: hydrogen                         peroxide(H2O2), superoxide anion(O2-), hydroxyl                         radicals(OH-), and single-line oxygen(1[O2]).
Fig. 1 Here shows the mutual conversion relationship between ROS.
All of them are eventually transformed into hydrogen peroxide, in that case we simplify our                         work to accumulate hydrogen peroxide.
As one of the important apoptosis-mediated factors, ROS could be propose under a variety of                         stress, such as cold induction, metal ion induction, high pressure induction. However,                         considering the feasibility, time period, operational difficulty, and the cause of ROS                         accumulation, we finally accumulated ROS through overexpressing yeast endogenous genes.
It's been established that overexpress some genes can accumulate ROS in yeast cells previously,                         in hence we selected two genes, yno1 (encodes a genuine NADPH oxidase, which is located                         in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and produces superoxide in a NADPH-dependent fashion) [6] . and ndi1 (codes for the internal mitochondrial ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which                         transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone in the electron transport chain) [7] to achieve our goal of ROS accumulation.
Improve the tolerance of ROS
Fig. 2 knock out gene yca1 through homologous reorganization.
Higher ROS content comes higher mortality rate. In order to prevent the yeast from dying for                             oxidation, simultaneously, maintain a high level of ROS accumulation in vivo, we need to knock                             out the gene yca1, which encodes synthesis of metacaspase, a homologue of the mammalian                             caspase, and is known to play a crucial role in the regulation of yeast apoptosis, for avoiding                             the death induced by high concentration ROS. [8]
Up to now, we complete the construction of a yeast stain that can accumulate ROS endogenous                             alive.
Fig. 3 gene circuit of Regulator part
Let's see how other parts are built step by step.
Feedback
When we have already placed the yeast cells in an oxidative state, next step is to control the                         accumulation of ROS. So we set up the feedback part.
We supposed that the reason of ROS accumulation in our project is the overexpression of related                         genes. If so, the ROS accumulation can be reduced through repressing gene expression. There are                         two common global-repressors to inhibit the gene expression, RNAi and dCas9 technology. We                         compared two technologies and asked our advisor, Dr. Ying Wang for advice. She suggested that                         we chose dCas9 for it got a higher success rate. We followed her advice and continued other                         designs.
After choosing the inhibition method, we started to find a ROS sensor with low sensitivity to                         ROS, since we hoped the sensor would only work under high level of ROS. But it didn’t exist,                         the only thing we could find in literature was protein Yap1, a basic leucine zipper (bZip)                         transcription factor from yeast. [9]
Fig. 4 How dose Yap1 work
Yap1 can sense the cytoplasmic H2O2 produced in mitochondria, which is a                         kind of signal meaning cells were at a high oxidant condition through an intramolecular                         disulfide bond generation. There two methionine closed to each other locates on the surface of                         protein, so when the ROS concentration increases significantly, the two thiol would be oxidized                         and generate an intramolecular disulfide bond generation leading change of protein structure.                         Then it will entry the nucleus to active some antioxidants enzymes transcription. Yap1 responds                         rapidly to cytoplasmic H2O2 due to a enzyme, Gpx3 (Orp1), a kind of                         catalase which can identify hydrogen peroxide efficiently, through the transformation of                         intermolecular disulfide bond. [10]
Fig. 5 gene circuit of Feedback part
Thus instead of using a sensor that is less sensitive to ROS, we tried to find some weak                         downstream promoters so that the ligated dCas9 protein would only have significant inhibitory                         effect when ROS accumulation is forcing yeast into death.
Output
As a ROS detector, our system should not only sense the intracellular ROS content, but be able                         to output signal, so that we know what happen exactly in the little tiny cells.                         Time to select a signal output substance. Like what we mentioned in description , we considered glutathione, which could sense ROS in vivo, but could not output, so it’s                         incompetent. Chemical fluorescent probe was not good enough either since its toxicity and long                         processing time, we preferred to find something existing in intracellular environment as a                         signal output. Eventually we found roGFP2---a kind of green fluorescent protein sensitive to                         redox in the Registry.
Fig. 6 How roGFP works.
The process of roGFP sensing ROS is similar to Yap1. RoGFP is a variant of GFP. Compared with                         the later one, roGFP has 8 amino acid mutations. Point of its sensitivity of redox states is                         two Mets which locate in the surface of protein. Once the cell is in a reduced state, the                         disulfide bond between two methionines will come into been, leading different absorption of                         light at two wavelengths. Specifically, the response of roGFP2 to H2O2 is                         reflected to its excitation spectrum (emission wavelength is 515 nm), which has a max absorbing                         peak at 405 nm and 490 nm. The peak value changes with the oxidation state of environment and                         this change is reversible. Measuring the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the roGFP at                         two wavelengths can reflect the changes of intracellular redox state in real time. [11]
However, roGFP dosen’t only reacts with H2O2, but also other oxides,                         which means it gets                         oxidized generally, there’s a lot of interference. So according to information about Yap1, we                         found that compared with Yap1 and Grx (Saccharomyces cerevisiae gluten), Orp1 has a                         specificity to H2O2, instead of all kinds of ROS. [12]
Fig. 7 How roGFP works.
Also there is similar transformation of intramolecular disulfide bond in Orp1-roGFP fusion                         protein to intermolecular transformation between Yap1 and Orp1.
Fig.8 Mutation of Aa sequence
With reference to the part designed by Cornell University in 2017: BBa_K229600                         , Constitutive Promoter-RBS-roGFP2-Orp1 C82S, the roGFP2-Orp1 (C82S) fusion protein sensitive                         to the intracellular redox state response was selected as the signal output of our project.
Fig. 9 Codon optimization
We also optimized the codon for roGFP2, making it more suitable for translation system of Saccharomyces                             cerevisiae cells.
Summary
Having established each part of our system, we can achieve our original aim “Detect and measure                         the antioxidant in living cell”. Let’s review how we design the whole gene circuits.
Fig. 10 Final gene circuits.
Firstly, in regulator part, overexpression of two genes, ndi1 and yno1, stimulates ROS                         accumulation in H2O2 form. Through knocking gene yca1, improve the tolerance of yeast cell to                         high level of H2O2 .
Secondly, H2O2 sensor Yap1, will transfer into cell nuclear to start antioxidant-relative genes transcription once sense the over accumulation of ROS. If the Yap1                         starts working, which indicates ROS level is so high that it is dangerous for our yeast cells.                         So the Yap1-dependent promoters selected from yeast genome will induce the dCas9 system to                         repress the translation process of ndi1 and yno1, maintaining a safe level of ROS                         amount in vivo.
Thirdly, through transforming the roGFP-Orp1 expression vector into host, we can easily know                         how everything going inside the yeast.
Eventually, final test part comes!
The testing antioxidant is added into culture, and the artificial accumulation of ROS will                         decrease through integrated cell reaction. Some dues to direct antioxidant reaction, other may                         be removed by cells natural anti-oxidant system which is activated by testing antioxidant. No                         matter which kind of working way the testing antioxidant is, its antioxidant capacity will be                         reflected by the remaining ROS level, reported through roGFP-Orp1. In a word, higher ROS                         remaining represent lower antioxidant capacity.
