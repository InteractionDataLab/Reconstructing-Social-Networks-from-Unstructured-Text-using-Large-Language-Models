Overview
Oxidation damage, aging and relative diseases are highly related to human health. Antioxidants are currently effective treatments. However, detection approaches to antioxidant are quite limited, especially in living-cells. Traditional methods largely focused on direct redox reaction which may have non-proper relation to living systems. Living cells are integrated with multiple natural anti-oxidant systems, including anti-oxidant enzyme system, reductive system, post-damage repair system, etc. All these make it sophisticated to evaluate real effects from exogenous antioxidant. To date, substantial efforts have been devoted to developing alternative strategies that can overcome the disadvantages and difficulties of online antioxidant detection in living cells .There is still no ideal result.                             One promising and challenging method for accomplishing this purpose is to construct a "living antioxidant detection device" via synthetic biology method. Yeast was used as host cell as it can present a simple and accurate measuring platform for us. Furthermore, we constructed multiple functional gene circuits to implement ROS regulating, endogenous redox reaction testing, and feedback regulation, etc. These results together demonstrate the excellent potential of this project in detecting antioxidant easily, accurately, fast and economically.
Ancient times, searching for anti-aging ways and secret of life's aging attract have been                         attracting countless passionate people.
Since 19th century, people have gradually realized the significance of antioxidants in solving                         the anti-aging puzzle and launched tireless exploration.
Chemical methods (1990s)
With the development of analytical methods and detection methods (such as L-band electron spin                         resonance (ESR), various probes, magnetic resonance imaging spin trapping and so                         on)，researchers have more confidence and ability to detect antioxidants. Besides, driven by the                         public's eagerness for health and beauty, many chemical detection methods emerged around the                         20th century. (such as, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), total oxyradical scavenge                         capacity (TOSC), the peroxyl scavenging capacity (PSC), the ferric reducing/antioxidant power                         assay (FRAP), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and so on)
The main measurement principle of chemistry methods is to characterize the reducibility of                     antioxidants by redox reaction with kinds of oxyradical. Chemistry methods has the advantages of                     handy, efficiency and accuracy.
However, this measurement principle is one-dimensional. On the one hand, its detecting conditions                     are almost different from the physiological environment that cell live in so that chemistry methods                     can't evaluate the antioxidant capability of antioxidants in the complicated metabolic process. On                     the other hand, living cells are integrated with multiple natural anti-oxidant systems, including                     anti-oxidant enzyme system, reductive system, post-damage repair system and so on in which                     antioxidants play a significant role and chemistry methods can't provide the stage of living cell.                     By the way, in 2012, USDA's Nutrient Data Laboratory (NDL) removed the USDA ORAC Database for                     Selected Foods from the NDL website because of the poor authenticity and low credibility of the                     chemistry methods. To sum up, the disadvantages of the chemical methods are two key words, low                     biological relevance and low credibility.
So, we design a detection system based on living cells that create a living-cell stage for                     antioxidants' performance. This improves biological relevance and credibility and the living cell                     is yeast, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
Why do we choose Saccharomyces Cerevisiae?
We chose yeast as the chassis cell of the product rather than HepG2 liver cancer cells, macrophage                     cells or Caco-2 colon cancer cells ect. Why?
● First, as we all know, the early researches on the mechanism of human diseases were explained                         by means of model organism yeast.
● Second, aging of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in stationary culture, often referred to                         as 'chronological aging', is a frequently applied system to study aging of eukaryotic cells.
● Last but not least, recently, human beings have the ability to synthesize yeast genome,                         which is an amazing breakthrough in the history of understanding of nature. Therefore, we                         choose yeast because of its practical application value and great potential in future.
Animal Model and Human Study (2000s)
Gradually. people realized the defects of the chemical methods, and began to detect                         antioxidants through animal model and human study which has higher biological relevance and                         credibility, after all the 21st century is a century for life science. Unfortunately, animal                         model and human study are time-consuming and expensive so that the initial antioxidants detect                         is not suitable. There's no doubt that cell-based detect is faster and cost-effective.
That's also the reason why we design cell-based detect system.
Cell-Based Method (CAA) (2007)
In 2007, Cell-based detection was first reported in the literature (CAA assay), which was a                         breakthrough in the history of antioxidants detection methods and was referenced widely. CAA                         assay characterizes the consumption of antioxidants on synthetic ROS (ABAP for Peroxyl                         Radicals) after entering cells by the fluorescence intensity of DCFH-DA fluorescent probes.                         Regretfully, it also has some shortcoming.
● On the one hand, both fluorescent probes and free radicals are artificially added from                             the external environment, which means introducing exogenous interference and it is not a                             completely endogenous cell detection.
● On the other hand, the credibility of the DCFH-DA probe has been criticized in the                             literature and it is also a question whether the synthesized radicals (ABAP for Peroxyl                             Radicals) can represent the endogenous ROS accumulated in cells.
To address these problems,
we need to consider the                     following things:
● On the one hand, in the system we designed the detection process needs to be completely                             intracellular without introducing exogenous interference.
● On the other hand, the signal we detect need to be representative of intracellular ROS.                             And we choose intracellular H2O2 as the final signal.
Why do we choose intracellular H2O2?
We choose intracellular H2O2 as the final signal to represent all kinds                         of ROS in cell and for                         this case our output component roGFP2-Orp1 has high H2O2-specificity.                         Why?
● Most intracellular ROS comes from mitochondria respiratory chain and all kinds of ROS                             will convert into H2O2 under the intracellular antioxidant enzyme                             system. Once H2O2 accumulated, it will transfer to the cytoplasm.
● H2O2 is the final form of all kinds of ROS.
● roGFP2-Orp1 exists in cytoplasm.
The choice of intracellular H2O2 as the final signal has higher                         representativeness than other                         choices.

We integrated its advantages and improved its shortcomings. Actually, the output components                         helped us save a lot of money rather than buying DCFH-DA probe.
Cell-Based Method (MTT) (2008)
Cell-based method MTT appeared in the same period as CAA. Their ideas and strategy are similar                         and don't need not be detailed here. MTT improved the disadvantage that CAA can only throw a                         single species of radical into cells. And the detection process is simpler. However, it was                         criticized because the text conditions is too extreme for living cells, which may not be                         representative of physiological settings.
This critical voice also reminds us that modest cell survival is necessary, considering that                         increase the ROS content by regulator components will increase stress of cells. Therefore, to                         improve the stability and reliability of product, and make it more durable. We designed the                         tolerance module.
Tolerance Module
Yca1 encodes synthesis of metacaspase, a homologue of the mammalian caspase, and plays a                         crucial role in the regulation of yeast apoptosis. According to the literature, knock out yca1 can improve the yeast tolerance to ROS, so we just do it. As a result, engineered strain can                         work at high ROS level.
Cell-Based Electrochemical Method (2017)
Today is the age of interdisciplinary integration. Cell-based detection combined with                         traditional electrochemistry, which is a landmark in the history of antioxidants detection. The                         cell-based electrochemical method uses NaAlg/GO hydrogels and 3D culture system to place cells in electrochemical workstation and adds nanoscale electrode materials for sensing intracellular                         ROS. It has good reproducibility and stability and is simple and rapid. However, it is still                         unable to achieve high-throughput screening for antioxidants and is difficult to popularize                         because of limitation of materials and instrument.
Synthetic                     Biological                     Strategy (2018)
21th century will become the new epoch of synthetic biology. As time goes on, synthetic biology                         is emerging in more and more fields and gives unique strategies to address kinds of problem.                         The plug-and-play characteristic of synthetic biological parts are conducive to the                         popularization of product.
In addition to the product design shown above, we have some special designs.
Design-Everything                         for Detecting
Feedback                     Module
Feedback Module works based on dCas9 technology and endogenous antioxidant system of yeast. We                         transformed and made use of that system sensing intracellular ROS level and starting our                         embedded genetic circuit properly to control the ROS level by dCas9. What's the role of                         Feedback Module?
● First, intracellular ROS level increased by regulator components may fluctuate, which                             causes the detection signal unstable. Therefore, we designed the Feedback Module which can                             regulate the ROS level in a stable range. Second, our sensor roGFP2-Orp1 has detecting                             threshold for ROS. The output signal is linear within the threshold and nonlinear beyond                             the threshold. Feedback Module can control ROS level within the detection threshold.
● Last, excessive accumulation of ROS will affect the survival of engineered strain.                             Feedback Module can ensure modest cell survival.
Screening Promoters
We screened out a lot of promoters for regulator                                 components (GAL1p), feedback                                 components (CTT1p, GLR1p                         , TRX2p, TRR1p, TSA1p, SOD2p, GSH1p, GSH2p, GAL1p                         and MSY1p), and output                                 components (FBA1p, TEF1p, TEF2p, ENO2p, PCK1p,                         PDC1p and PGI1p)                         to find the promoter with the most suitable expression for detection. Additionally, because of                         the plug-and-play characteristic, the selected promoters with different expression strength                         also provide the possibility and alternatives for future application under different                         conditions.
Design                     Modeling
Modeling is an important part of synthetic biology. A science can only be truly perfected when                         it successfully applies mathematics.
Considering that fluorescence intensity of roGFP2-orp1 can only characterize the relative level                         of intracellular ROS qualitatively, but can't give the absolute content of intracellular ROS                         quantitatively, we established the model based on Michealis equation and some assumptions,                         which can convert fluorescence intensity of roGFP2-orp1 into the intracellular H2O2 concentration. As a result, the output signal of roGFP2-orp1 has a more intuitive meaning and                         higher application value.

Human Practices                     for Product
We need to consider how its lifecycle can more broadly impact our lives and environments in                         positive and negative ways. There is on doubt that human practice is the best way.
COFCO
one of the world's top 500 companies with a good reputation in the international grain and oil                         food market, became our first interviewee. We asked them about the market of current                         antioxidant products. And we learned that
● The sales of anti-oxidant products are on the rise.
● More and more people are pursuing anti-oxidant and anti-aging products.
Therefore, we have more reasons to believe that our product has a good application prospect in                         the market.
Wehand-bio
A leading innovative pharmaceutical company in Beijing, communicated with us about what our                         product can do.
● Most medicines would use antioxidants to prevent oxidation of medicines. So, our product                             could also be applied in pharmaceutical production.
● In addition to detect the antioxidant capability of antioxidants, we also can test                             whether the natural antioxidant products will deteriorate in quality over time.
Now, more and more antioxidant products are on the market, consumers are confused about the                         antioxidant effect of products and we learned it by questionnaires. Hopefully our product can                         help them.
You know the most amazing thing is that countless excellent natural antioxidants are hidden in                         nature, just countless starts twinkling in the Milky Way. When I was young, I looked up at                         starry sky and asked, "Are there aliens in the universe?". Someone answer, "The universe is                         big, bigger than you, bigger than anything. If it's just us, it is a waste of space." Today I                         wonder if there are excellent antioxidants in the nature to solve the problem of aging. There                         are so many substances in nature beyond our imagination. If not, it is a waste of space.                         Hopefully, our product can detect excellent antioxidants, which is our original dream.
We would do our best to make the product more beneficial to the world.
