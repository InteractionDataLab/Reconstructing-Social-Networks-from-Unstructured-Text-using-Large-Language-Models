Meeting up
Meetup held by ITCCC
On July 24th, we were invited to take part a meeting upheld by International Teenager                         Competition and Communication Center on campus of USTB, during which 4 teams shared the                         experimental process about their project of iGEM. We found some problems in the design of each                         other's projects through communication, and discussed some solutions and ideas. Each team                         received a lot of pertinent suggestions from the others, which helped a lot to our project.
Meetup in Shanghai
By the end of August, we had preliminarily completed all parts of experimental verification,                         constructed the relevant proteins, and verified the strength of each promoter. In order to                         further improve our project and make progress with other teams from communication, we                         participated in CCIC. All of the teams exchanged ideas about their project and original design                         and have a quick exhibition of the poster, give some simple but classic presentation. Among                         which we also try to find ways to better collaborate with other teams, especially in the                         modelling and outreach. We received more than 10 useful advises about our project and having a                         great time!

We determined the inhibitory effect of PLA (phenyllactic acid, a new type of natural                         antibacterial substance and preservative) on yeast CEN.PK2-1C. In this way, we knew more                         about the broad-spectrum antibacterial performance of PLA. (check here for more detail)
We provided them with the E.coli strain containing BBa_K2120006 for they decided to make                         an improvement on it. (check here for more detail)
They designed a handbook that contains an introduction of iGEM and tips for preventing                         bacterial infections in daily life, presenting useful information in a more concise and clearer                         way, focused on the prevention of harmful bacterial and how to maintain environmental                         sanitation. We learned the manual and promoted it to the community. Helping them broaden the                         scope of the promotion, namely the northeastern part of China (check here for more detail)

In the early days of collaborations, we explained to FJNU-China about the needs and                         difficulties of our modeling. After analyzing, communicating and consulting the literature,                         they helped us establish the ODE equation in the hydrogen peroxide decomposition model and                         provided us with guiding recommendations and feasibility verification strategies.

Collaborations                     with Peking
They shared us the right of using flow cytometer and helped us measure the related data of                         regulator group, finally got the fluorescence intensity of a single cell. (check here for more detail)
Besides, the two teams discussed each other's project content and problems, and raised some                         questions and views, solving existing problems of both projects.

Our work in 2017 made several fundamental changes to the pheromone pathway, facilitating the                         further transformation of biosensors in their team in 2018. So we shared the stain of modified CEN.pk2-1C,                         which used it to:
1. Exclude the possibility that the pheromone pathway is affected by the native ligand                         pheromone in                         yeast: (Knock out the Ste2 receptor);
2. Exclude upstream G-protein coupled receptor signaling attenuation (desensitization) that may                         result from sustained stimulation. (Knock out Sst2, the GTPase-activating protein for Gpa1p, as                         a                         receptor-desensitizing factors.)
3. Exclude side effects on cell life cycle, cell morphology, etc. due to enhanced MAPK pathway                         signaling in the Pheromone pathway. (Knock out Far1, the cyclin-dependent protein                         serine/threonine                         kinase inhibitor.)
We also shared our original strain CEN.PK2-1C which no knockout of Ste2, Sst2, Far1 was                         performed. And the results of ligand binding response before and after gene knockout of                         pheromone                         pathway were compared to verify the significance of the modification for knocking out side                         effects. (check                             here for more detail)

After understanding our needs for modeling, they helped us build a descriptive model based on                         the                         mechanism of action of fluorescent probes. The model validates this linear relationship through                         experimental data and predicts future possible outcomes by constructing a linear regression                         model.                         And they also analyzed the residuals of the model to ensure it works well. With this model, we                         can                         properly predict the output when the concentration of H2O2 is in certain                         interval.
