Overview
This year we brought a portable microarray chip and smartphone-based optical biosensor for high-throughput biomarkers detection. A mature microarray chip processing platform is constructed to address wide range of uses. Meanwhile, smartphone-based optical biosensor powers the detection and diagnostic features. In addition, we tested two optimization methods for liquid pumping in microfluidic chip, and the results are posted on the page “Microarray” for share.
