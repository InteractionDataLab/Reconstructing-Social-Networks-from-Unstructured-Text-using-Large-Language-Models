Introduction
So, we set up this page specially describe the improved Part, BBa_K2765043 , which can produce redox-sensitive                         green fluorescent protein roGFP2-Orp1 and display intracellular ROS content by its fluorescence                         ratio.
Source
First, we obtained the gene sequence of roGFP2 from the part: BBa_K2296006: Constitutive                         Promoter-RBS-roGFP2-Orp1 C82S.
Second, we synthesized the codon-optimized roGFP2+linker sequence, obtained the sequence of orp1 from the yeast genome and ligated them by OE-PCR, which enhanced the specificity and                         sensitivity of roGFP2 to H2O2.
Codon Optimization
As shown, we mutated the cysteine at position 82 of the Orp1 protein to serine, which made our signal output                         more responsive and increased the protein expression of roGFP2-Orp1.
Promoter Optimization
According to this measurement principle, the concentration of roGFP2-Orp1 protein can influence                         the final signal output strength. So, 4 promoters, FBA1p, TEF2p, TEF1p, ENO2p, with different                         expression intensity were screened, because we wish this BioBrick Part can output signal with                         suitable intensity in different situation.
Modeling Optimization
Beyond these, we also did some dry-lab for this Part. Considering that fluorescence intensity                         of roGFP2-Orp1 can only characterize the relative level of intracellular ROS qualitatively, but                         can’t give the absolute content of intracellular ROS quantitatively, we established the model                         based on Michaelis equation and some assumptions, which can convert fluorescence intensity of                         roGFP2-Orp1 into the intracellular H2O2 concentration. As a result, the                         output signal of roGFP2-Orp1 has a more intuitive meaning and higher application value. (click here for more details)
Characterization and Measurement
Measure the response of roGFP2-Orp1 to H2O2
According to literature[1], roGFP2-Orp1 green fluorescent protein shows peak value                         at 405nm (oxidation peak) and 488nm (reduction peak). Fluorescence ratio R (R=I405 / I408) is                         uesed to the redox degree of roGFP2-Orp1. Therefore, we used different H2O2 concentrations (independent variable) to simulate the accumulation of ROS in cells and                         the fluorescence ratio (dependent variable) to characterize the redox degree of                         roGFP2-Orp1, which means that the increase of fluorescence ratio R shows roGFP2-Orp1 is                             oxidized and the decrease shows reduction.
Figure.2 Experimental Group
As Figure.2 shown, the fluorescence ratio R of roGFP2-Orp1 increases with the increase of H2O2 concentration. And the fluorescence ratio is basically unchanged when the concentration of H2O2 exceeds 0.8 mM.
Figure.3 Control Group
As Figure.3 shown, the fluorescence ratio of wide-type was not affected by the change of H2O2 concentration and remained unchanged.
Verify redox reversibility of roGFP2-Orp1
Firstly, we made the cells almost be oxidation state by adding 1mM H2O2 and observed the change of fluorescence ratio R (dependent variable) with time (independent                         variable).
Figure.4 Verify Redox Reversibility of roGFP2-Orp1
As Figure.4 shown, the fluorescence ratio R decreased slightly in the range of 0 to 20 min,                         because cell itself has the mechanism of scavenging ROS and H2O2 will                         decompose spontaneously. At the 23 min, we added DTT (strong reducing agent) with the final                         concentration of 5mM. As a result, the fluorescence ratio R decreased significantly.
Therefore, the redox of our roGFP2-Orp1 is reversible.
Verify codon optimization of roGFP2-Orp1
Determinate the DTT concentration making roGFP2-Orp1 completely reduced.
We added three different concentrations of DTT, 0.5mM, 3mM and 5mM. When DTT was added, the                         roGFP2-Orp1 should be reduced and the fluorescence ratio R should decrease.
Figure.5 Relationship Between R and DTT Concentration
(After Codon Optimization)
Figure.6 Relationship Between R and DTT Concentration
(Before Codon Optimization)
As shown, when the concentration of DTT was 3 mM, the fluorescence ratio R was no longer                         decreased with the increase of the DTT concentration. At that time, the cells were in reduced                         state completely.
Characterize roGFP2-Orp1 protein expression before and after codon optimization.
To exclude the influence of individual differences, we made cell be in the same state of redox                         by adding 5Mm DTT. In that case, roGFP2-Orp1 proteins were in the complete reduction state.                         Fluorescence intensity can characterize protein expression and we used fluorescence / OD600 to                         approximate the expression protein of roGFP2-Orp1 in single cell.

Figure.10 Contrast After Codon Optimization with Before Codon Optimization on                             Protein Expression

As Figure.7~Figure.10 shown, codon optimized roGFP2-Orp1 had higher expression protein than                         control group without codon optimization and wide-type without fluorescent protein.
Therefore, the codon optimization improved the roGFP2-Orp1 protein expression successfully.
