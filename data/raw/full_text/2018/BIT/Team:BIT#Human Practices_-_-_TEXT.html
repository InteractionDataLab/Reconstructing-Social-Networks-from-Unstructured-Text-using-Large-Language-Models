In this section, we hope to present a panoramic view of the entire practice activity , so we list what we have done in chronological order and give a detailed description of each work. Every single work  is carried out after careful arrangement and thinking.
WHEN: 5.9-6.3
WHERE: online
WHO: netizen
WHAT:
To know how other people thought about our JACOB2.0. We release a questionnaire online, and got 450 responses. It is really amazing that we received suggestions from people of different regions, different age groups even different education background . With their help, we made a conclusion which shaped our design and emphasis of the whole project .
WHEN: 6.8
WHERE: Aerospace General Hospital in Beijing
WHO: an expert in clinical laboratory department
WHAT:
We went to the hospital laboratory and asked the expert to verify the clinical application of biomarkers and the time consuming and cost of hospital detection.
We know that biomarkers are of great clinical significance, but hospitals do not have instruments for early disease screening.
The equipment of the hospital is more expensive, because turn on the machine to start one detection’s cost is high, so they will accumulate certain sample and then do the examination For the cost of the hospital surveillance project, by the price bureau and so on the department prescribes the price must be generally twice the cost.
WHEN: 8.2
WHERE: the remote areas of Guizhou province
WHO: the headmaster of the local primary school & the host of the local hotel
WHAT:
We conducted interviews about early disease screening and treatment of local people in remote areas of Guizhou province on the basis of summer education. After that, combined with online research, we have summed up three major causes of poverty due to illness: high time cost, high money cost, low medical resources.
WHEN: 8.15
WHERE: BOHUI-Tech in Beijing
WHO: the company's leading R & D staff
WHAT:
During our project this year, in order to investigate our chip and instrument design and marketing issues, we went to BOHUI-Tech. It is a special biological kit and microfluidic chip technology associated with manufacturing enterprises.                     We first had a visit around the company. The fully automated chip production really broaded our horizon.We even talked with the company's leading R & D staff about our overall design of the project and our questions. We received a lot of professional guidance.
WHEN: 8.25
WHERE: Liangxiang Campus of Beijing Institute of Technology
WHO: freshman and sophomore
WHAT:
We went to our university---Beijing Institute of Technology to do a preaching for the freshmen. They show a lot of curiosity about both iGEM and synthetic biology.
We patiently introduced iGEM to them and answered many questions they had about our team.
WHEN: 9.20/9.29
WHERE: High/middle school
WHO: students
WHAT:
We hope for children from the next generation of synthetic biology is the propaganda is not just a preach but long-term understanding and learning process, we used easy and understandable ways to introduce people to synthetic biology this year. We also design a mini program for students to learn and browsing about synthetic biology, iGEM, and related knowledge introduction together website recommendation. The enthusiasm of the students is so high that we get good feedback as below.
In fact, WeChat mini program is more than just a program. Our design for it is not only a simple introduction, but a platform for resource exchange and sharing. We will provide lab visits and iGEM training registration opportunities and simple basic knowledge testing in this program. It provides opportunities for high school students to study at a higher level. In the future, we would like to contact the high school affiliated to Beijing institute of technology, we also hope that we can realize the formalize synthetic biology lectures.
WHEN: 4.20-10.10
WHERE: Beijing Institute of Technology
WHO: Experts
WHAT:
Deng Yulin
Professor of Institute of space biomedical engineering
Professor deng yulin provided us with the overall idea of our project, especially on the implementation of the integrated chip and the overall feasibility of the project. He also shared us knowledge with in-depth explorations on the synthetic biology usage in detection and its significance. including suggestions on the construction and safety of the whole team.

She is an expert in research about biosensor. In the process of the project, Se has given us very important guidance on the function realization of the whole biosensor design.
Li Xiaoqiong
Associate professor of Institute of space biomedical engineering
He takes weak signal detection technology as the core research direction. As we hope in a new form for engineering bacterium fluorescence signal detection met difficult to reconcile the contradictions, but we asked him and seek for solution and with the help of him, we completed a a new type microbial sensor which takes smart phone as the core.
Xu Jiandong
Development department and public relation department manager of BO-HUI company
This summer, we went to BO-HUI company. we introduced our project to the technical staff of the development team and got many useful Suggestions. In addition, we also had a interview with Xu , and talk about marketing sections and the laws and regulations. Such as the need to show to the public unique and novel point but do not  overturns the mainstream, and the need for relevant in vitro testing instrument and platform application and strictly comply with the required by laws and regulations, etc.
Li Yongrui , Li kunjie and Yang Yuanzhan. PhD and Graduate student
At the time of the device design, we had frets about how to make our device a more suitable place for biological experiment and the choice of device interface with the outside. Through interviews with them we got many suggestions and views, including the design of the interface need to be user friendly and easy to handle.Yang yuanzhan, graduate student, he can master skills in lab. He helped us to carry out a detailed analysis of the results and processes of biological experiments.

WHEN: 7.25-9.10
WHERE: Laws and regulations investigation
WHO: \
WHAT:
Laws & Regulations research can re-examine whether our projects conform to national regulations and requirements.
By carefully reading “Guiding principles for Registration and Application of quantitative Detection Reagents for tumor markers”, we learned about the product performance indicators that conform to the regulations. We checked the minimum detection limit, detection range, precision, specificity of our project and try to make the various indicators of our project to meet the requirements and optimize our project.
At the same time, we also want to know how to do if our biomarkers products can be put on the market, so we checked the "Registration Management method for in Vitro Diagnostic Reagents," and learn that the specific indicators should be determined according to the specific markers. And the product standard formulated by the applicant shall not be lower than the national standard or industry standard.

Integrated Practice
In integration practice part, we integrated the work of each independent practice according to our understanding and thinking of the project. What we prepared to present is  practical work aiming at the project and considering the integrity of the project
JACOB 2.0, like all other diagnostic or diseases screening medical products, must suits the conditions of various hosts and producers (e.g. hospitals and factories). Our out-of-lab, bi-directional research confirms that JACOB 2.0 is well prepared for the real market. We conducted interviews and sampled opinions as well as market need from both clinical laboratories and from the public. Project feasibility is confirmed and greatly improved as we went to BO-HUI company, in which we got helpful suggestions about the realization of biological processing and device design during the troubleshooting discussion session.We analyzed the market trend, also carefully investigated laws and regulations. From beginning to end, experts interviews are involved in our Integrated Practice. We believe that Human Practice is a crucial process of discovering and rediscovering meanings of our project, and through its in-person, authentic feedbacks we learn and improve.
As you can see, we mainly focus on three aspects
First, Markets research and Investigation
There are multiple steps in the pathway from biomarker discovery to use in clinical practice.[1][2]
Despite the explosive growth in the biomarker research field and market, only a small number of the thousands of proposed biomarkers have been adopted into clinical practice.[1]
In order to verify whether the market of biomarkers is right or wrong, we went to the hospital laboratory of Aerospace General Hospital in Beijing to do an interview about the clinical application of biomarkers , time consuming on the way and cost of hospital detection.
We know that biomarkers are of great clinical significance, but big hospitals barely have instruments for early disease screening.
To know how the potential patient thought about early detection and our JACOB 2.0. We release a questionnaire online, and got 470 responses which covered almost all the provinces in China. The questionnaire found that people have different views on an instrument that is suitable for detecting disease markers in the community, which facilitates early detection and early warning of various diseases, saves time and reduces the cost of detection.
Among the people who participated in the questionnaire, 84.5% had expressed a desire to know it, because of saving time, saving money, convenient to use, time is very precious, the early the know the disease, the more likely the will be cured. But there are still 15.5% of them thought it is not reliable.
But only 10.19% of the total lives in countryside, we thought the sample is not enough. So we went to remote areas of Guizhou province. We went deep into the local countryside to learn about the situation about early disease screening and treatment of local people. After that, combined with online research, we have summed up three major causes of poverty due to illness: high time cost, high money cost, low medical resources.
Second, experts talking and company visit
After completing the detailed investigation of detection biomarkers, we started to design our JACOB2.0. We have always been cautious about the realization of the project. We have carefully considered the suggestions of experts in the design, implementation and construction of the whole project.
At first, we presented and discussed the overall design of the project with professor Deng Yulin , such as the sensor part about the signal transmission part, we talked to our PI Lu Xuefei and asked for realization of the whole biosensor design.. In addition, we communicated and analyzed with Graduate Yang Yuanzhan graduate student on the specific implementation of biological experiments .For part of the chip design, chip and biological adaptation and instrument design problem has always been a part of our obsession, with PhD Li Yongrui and Graduate Likunjie to discuss and analysis.
we also went to the BO-HUI company, which has matured for the design and production of microarray , also talked with R&D staff of this company. In addition, in the market and application, we also interviewed and interviewed experts Xu Jiandong. And talk about marketing sections and the laws and regulations. Such as the need to show to the public unique and novel point but do not  overturns the mainstream, and the need for relevant in vitro testing instrument and platform application and strictly comply with the required by laws and regulations, etc.
Third, laws and regulation study
Laws & Regulations research can re-examine whether our projects conform to national regulations and requirements.
By carefully reading “Guiding principles for Registration and Application of quantitative Detection Reagents for tumor markers”, we learned about the product performance indicators that conform to the regulations. We checked the minimum detection limit, detection range, precision, specificity of our project and try to make the various indicators of our project to meet the requirements and optimize our project.
At the same time, we also want to know how to do if our biomarkers products can be put on the market, so we checked the "Registration Management method for in Vitro Diagnostic Reagents," and learn that the specific indicators should be determined according to the specific markers. And the product standard formulated by the applicant shall not be lower than the national standard or industry standard.

Education & public engagement
In the Education&Public engagement section, this year, we mainly completed the explanation and presentation of synthetic biology knowledge and iGEM  for students from three different ages group, middle school, high school and university students.
Junior high school:
we went to Beijing Fangshan District Hope Primary School on a sunny afternoon for about 1 hour to explain the knowledge of synthetic biology.
Not only did we unilaterally introduce the students there about synthetic biology, we also used the principle of flipping the classroom. Divide the children into five groups and give them 10min time to read the material we give and let them talk about the use of synthetic biology in life.
When we explained that synthetic biology is "the most basic element of building components step by step," a child raised his innocent face and asked us, "is synthetic biology the same as Lego building blocks?" Is it possible to connect a little bit?
"We were surprised that the children had made synthetic biology more figurative and easier to understand.
We were given an opportunity to carry out a seminar in the senior school affiliated to the Beijing institute of technology. We gave lectures and shared sessions on synthetic biology to students from all three grades. We started by playing a video of an iGEM team's simple explanation of synthetic biology on YouTube, so that they understood the concept of synthetic biology in a very simple way.

As we went on, we explained synthetic biology in a more professional way and handed out our introductory folding. At the end of the activity we also got good feedback from questionnaire of this lecture,students raised some fun questions also. we have completed the initial period of knowledge introduction, but this time we want to make something different, for the students who study synthetic biology need long and continuous period of time. so we design a app for students to learn and browsing about synthetic biology, iGEM, and related knowledge introduction together with website recommendation. The enthusiasm of the students is so high that we get good feedback as below.
In fact, this App is more than a program. Our design for it is not only a simple introduction, but a platform for resource exchange and sharing. We will provide lab visits and iGEM training registration opportunities and simple basic knowledge testing in this program. It provides opportunities for high school students to study at a higher level. In the future, we would like to contact the high school affiliated to Beijing institute of technology about the promotion of this App
College: we arrived at another campus early with folding pages and posters, where we gave street lectures for the whole school.
Perhaps because we are an English poster, or because we are wearing uniform clothes, many people come to our posters and listen to us with interest.
Many freshmen are interested in synthetic biology and have asked us in detail about the information on posters and folding pages, and we have patiently explained it.
