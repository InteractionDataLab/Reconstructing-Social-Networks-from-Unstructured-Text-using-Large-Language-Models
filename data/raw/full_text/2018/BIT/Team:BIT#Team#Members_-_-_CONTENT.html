In our team, I work in team of hardware, I learnt microcontroller and built the circuit for the first time. Obviously, this is a synthetic biology competition, I learnt lots of knowledge about synthetic biology, also, I did some little experiments, made several micro-fluidic chip, wrote several versions of the project book, which train my ability in all ways.
                                When I first entered the team, I was a freshman, because both freshmen and sophomores are in the new campus, and the lab is in the old campus. Every time I went to the regular meeting, I had to take the subway for one and a half hours to the old campus. During the period, the captain gave us a temporary bed in the old campus in order to provide convenience to our team members on the new campus. It’s very fun to do a little bit of work although it’s very tired to go to the workplace.

This year is my first time to join iGEM. I am mainly responsible for the work of the hardware group. In the process, I learned what a microfluidic chip and knew its material and manufacturing process. Besides, I knew the difference of the idea of synthetic biology and traditional organisms. At the same time, because our group's work involves instruments and chips, I also came into contact with the knowledge that can't be received by professional courses, such as Microcontrollers, optical path detection, signal transmission, etc. The knowledge greatly expanded my horizons and helped me. I saw a different biology. Thank you for everything this experience has brought me.

Last year, I made the decision to participate in iGEM at a crucial stage for college. However, from then on to now, I've never regretted the decision even though I encountered difficulties that I could not overcome. Devoting myself to one thing for more than ten months urges me to grow. Growing is an exhausting thing, requiring attention to detail, logic from chaos, experience and approaches from failure and courage in all situations. But even if I try in vain many times, I learn to persevere alone. And it gives me a lot of courage to face difficulties together with my teammates. By the time the project is finished this year, I think I'll be grateful for everything I've experienced along the way.</P></DIV></EL-CAROUSEL-ITEM><EL-CAROUSEL-ITEM><DIV class="self left"><H1>Tieendiesi·Manatibieke</H1><P>My name is TIEENDIESI·MANATIBIEKE , I’m a junior student of bioengineering from school of life science, Beijing Institute of Technology.

My name is Sarah Avatar (WELL…Because my classmates thought I look like Avatar…) This year I am a sophomore!!!No more a freshman~ Yeah~
                                I major in Mechanical Engineering. (Ye…I am a girl…Please do not doubt my sex…)
                                In team, I am in the hardware group and HP group. In 616, I am a record machine of K-pop with Yvette.
                                Although biology is not my major, but I fell in love with it since senior high school. I saw a TV program named“KAI JIANG LA”. There was a scientist named “YAN NIENG” who attracted me deeply and made me fall in love with biology. My senior high school biology teacher also take really good care of me, and we even talked about some interesting things in life together sometimes. Those all made me love biology a lot.
                                Also, I am public-spirited. Once I knew that POCT can help people in remote districts, I know I could not give up it any more. No matter how hard it will be in the future, I will keep on struggling to develop it.
