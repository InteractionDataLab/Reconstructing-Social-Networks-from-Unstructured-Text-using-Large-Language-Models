Our components include many categories. For example, we use s-adenosine methionine ribose switches to build related gene detection lines, and the induction promoters are also used.In addition,we emphatically modified three promoters by changing certain base sequences, aiming to improve their transcription efficiency.Then, we connected E0840 with them to test the effect of modification by detecting the fluorescence expression.
