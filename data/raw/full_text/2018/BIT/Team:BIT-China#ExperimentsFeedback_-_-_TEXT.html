FEEDBACK
To further ensure Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells will survive under a                     high level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) automatically, we made a series of                     genetic transformation, which will be shown as follow.
Promoter screening
Overview
Overview                         As it was showed in the project, we needed to find a proper strong promoter to turn on the                         expression of dCas9, so we designed experiments as follow.
Specific Method
As Yap1 protein has over 70 downstream genes, we need to choose some gene                         that has known strength. Reports show that the downstream gene of Yap1 protein's mRNA level                         changes with and without H2O2. [1] Because we have no idea of                         the exact strength of these promoters, we chose both strong promoters and weak ones in this                         result and compared them with promoters that we have already known their strength. We tested                         downstream genes of Yap1 whose names were: ctt1, glr1, trx2, trr1, tsa1, sod2, gsh1, and gsh2, together with strong promoter gal1p and weak promoter msy1p. We                         obtained these promoters through PCR, and we ligated these promoters with GFP gene to                         express GFP protein and test their strength through fluorescence intensity. This is the                         first step to screen the proper promoter.
Construction of dCas9-sgRNA plasmid
Overview
After confirming the proper promoter, we started to construct the plasmid                         contains dCas9 expression cassette and the sgRNA one.
Specific methods
After obtaining the promoter strength, we started to construct the                         dCas9-sgRNA plasmid. To avoid bringing the yeast too much living stress (every plasmid will                         bring living stress to the yeast), we decided to construct the dCas9 and sgRNA gene together in one plasmid. We constructed the promoter with dCas9 gene and the                         promoter of sgRNA, Snr52p, with the sgRNA in the plasmid as follows. The two                         different sgRNAs were designed to inhibit ndi1 and yno1.
Result & discussion
Promoter screening
We obtained the nine promoters through PCR successfully.

The results of fluorescence intensity are as follows.

As the experimental result of other parts, we added 2% galactose into                         medium, and added 1μl H2O2 before testing fluorescence intensity. We                         believe that the data after one hour of processing is the most reliable. We chose four                         promoters later, which were the strongest one, trr1p, the weakest one, glr1p, and                         two mild, sod2p and glr1p. We confirmed the promoter in next step of the                         experiment.
Construction of dCas9-sgRNA plasmid
We respectively replaced the original promoter of dCas9 with promoters                         mentioned above and transformed them into yeast cells. We observed that the yeast cells with                         promoter trx2p grew fastest so we decided to choose trx2p as the final promoter.                         We tested the inhibitory effect through growth curve. We used the ndi1/yno1 overexpressed strain and obtained growth curve through its OD600. As shown by the growth curve,                         the growth of the strain with the dCas9-sgRNA plasmid was similar to that of the original                         strain, and superior to the strain overexpressing ndi1/yno1.This result proves that our                         feedback part works well.
