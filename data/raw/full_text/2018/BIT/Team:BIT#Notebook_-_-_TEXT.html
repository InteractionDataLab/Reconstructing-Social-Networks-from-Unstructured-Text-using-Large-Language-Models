Week 5(5.14-5.20)
In Before going into the laboratory, All team members had several laboratory safety training lessons. And nobody have the right to go into the laboratory if he/she didn’t get permission from teacher Yaxi Zhang, who is responsible for the lab safety. In this week, we discussed about the method that might use in biological experiments. And completed reagent selection and purchase also.
