QINGHUI SONG
I am a postgraduate from Beijing Institute of                     Technology,                     majoring in biology. I am the kind of person who is easily moved and somewhat of a perfectionist,                     even                     in small things, and I do need more self-confidence to see a thing through to the end. I love                     reading,                     which can give me happiness and quietness. I really enjoy my life now, although I still have many                     dreams                     to chase. This summer, being an advisor, I am very glad to be involved in iGEM and synthetic                     biology!
MINGMING CAO
As an impressive team in iGEM, BIT-China has                     accompanied                     me for a couple of years since 2014. Even though time brought me into a new journal at Georigia                     Tech                     this fall (M.S), with fortune and honor, I could still have the opportunities to participate in                     BIT-China                     as an advisor. Helping my cute young team members to revise their design truly delights me. I                     believe                     that our team, BIT-China 2018, will continue glowing this year. Look forward to their next                     performance!

Different from last year, an ordinary                     member,                     I’ve changed my role into a team leader in BIT-China, in that case I experienced and learned much                     more.                     Still I’m keep learning new things, so I must say that iGEM do teach me a lot.

FANCHEN YU
I’m Yu Fanchen. When I first met IGEM, I said                     excitedly                     without thinking, “Oh my God! It’s the job that only the God can do. Cool!” If I have the chance to                     be                     an iGEMer, I can be the God to create a life and transform it. Wow! How exciting it is. Finally,                     God                     blessed me and I made it. How lucky I am. And I know that if you want to be a God, you should                     search                     for and read tons of papers firstly. Maybe the time iGEM shared with me is just a year in the very                     long                     life, but I would love iGEM forever. Thanks a lot.
