                </H1><P><B>Our project</B>
                    Our project is to a use universal biological system to detect biomarkers in samples on microfluidics chips to achieve early warning of disease. Our biological system is mainly composed of Escherichia coli (DH5 bacteria) and single-stranded nucleic acid, we use microfluidic chip as carrier platform which will be sterilized and recycled after use, so it will not cause any harm to human and the environment.
                </P><P><B>Our project</B>
                    The Safety Level of our lab is Level 1 (low risk)
                    All our team members received safety training from teacher Yaxi, Zhang, who take in charge of lab safety and security. We only do experiments in open bench and biosafety cabinet.
                </P><P><B>Chassis organism</B>
                    The organism we use in our experiments are E.coli(DH5alpha)
                    The E.coli is used in our own microfluidic chip to complete the detection.

                    In a consumer product that ordinary people buy
                    In a small enclosed device
                    According to the expectations of project ,we want to detect the concentration of specific biomarkers in vitro. we use microfluidic chip as carrier platform which will be sterilized and recycled after use, so it will not cause any harm to human and the environment.
