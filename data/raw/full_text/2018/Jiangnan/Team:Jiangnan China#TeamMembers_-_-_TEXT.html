Overview
 
 
    We are a team from Jiangnan University in Wuxi, China. As the first team to participate in iGEM, we are learning and exploring with a sincere heart.
    Our team is named Jiangnan_China, composed of students from different grades in different schools. We have studied from multiple perspectives and adopted biosynthetic methods to solve the problems of Lactococcus lactis in the human intestine, which is not resistant to acids and freezing during transportation and storage. There are still many problems in the work waiting for us, but we humbly ask for advice, and strive to find more opportunities to find and solve in order to improve the work.
    Jiangnan University was established in 1958 and has 60 years of history this year. It is located on the bank of Taihu Lake and is known as "the pearl of higher education in light industry". Our university has 5 national research bases, 14 provincial and ministerial level scientific research bases, and 7 bases of other platform. The university encourages students to enter the laboratory as soon as possible to observe and learn, stimulate interests, and provides us with a good scientific research platform. The proportion of senior titles in our school is 69%, and doctoral degree is 52%. The academic atmosphere is strong. Our university actively exchanges and cooperates with universities and enterprises at home and abroad, actively promotes the transformation of scientific research results into practical commercial applications, and creates a high-quality, high-pursuit college. Dropouts are still good and they stop at perfection.
