Background
Vaccine has been considered as one of the most cost-effective public health solution which could be used to prevent a large varieties of diseases. However, several factors such as high cost, unstable quality, weak supervision have been considerably limiting the development of the vaccine industry. Jiangnan team is thus motivated to reduce the cost of vaccine production through establishing a suspension cell line with self-owned intellectual for rapid production of a broad spectrum of viruses using synthetic biology approaches.
We do not have any biosafety issue as we do not work with human viruses but focus on animal vaccine at the current stage which do not impose any risk to the lab or environment.
