This year we've designed several parts, including four basic parts and six composite parts. All of the parts were designed by ourselves and most of them have been tested to insure their reliability. To see their specific function, please slide down this page to learn about our project, or browse the specific page on parts.igem.org by clicking on the part numbers for details.
