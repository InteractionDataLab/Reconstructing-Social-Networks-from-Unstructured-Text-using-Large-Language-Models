HOW IT BEGAN...
One of the most important things regarding in iGEM is that this competition is so much aboutit emphasizes teamwork. When we all met for the first time in January, we were just 14 people from different academic backgrounds with the aim ofho wanted to learning more about synthetic biology and what it’s like to work in the lab. We didn’t really know were not aware of what is exactly ahead of us such as what we were getting ourselves into – and that so many unsuccessfulsuccessive failures in PCR’s, disappointing sequencing resultsthe experiments, exhaustiveng lab work and non-sleeping nightsnights and quite a lot of discussions and quarrels were ahead of us. 
Now we’veAfter worked together for almost 8 months’ teamwork, and have really become a teamwe become friends and form a family. Despite of some inevitable problems and issues, we have overcomame many problems encountered during this process. We difficulties and realized a project we’are now very proud of ourselves and feel excited to have the chance and honour to present our work at the Giant Jamboree in Boston. 
Most of us were part of We are divided into different subgroups, like including Lab, Wiki andor Human Practices. We have learned a lot during this process, and learned heaps of new thing，but of course iGEM wasn’t only about work –  andwe participated in several great events, like such as the Asia Pacific meetup in Taiwan and Chinese Conference of iGEM Community. Besides, wWe did quitehad held a fewseveral teambuilding activities and had a lot of fun together. All in alTaken together,l joining iGEM isit was an unforgettablea valuable experience time, which has left us with many cherishable memories and helped us to growwe made many new friends along the way and gained valuable experiences.
PI
Xiaofeng Dai
As our primary PI, Prof. Xiaofeng Dai has been devoted to precision medicine, synthetic biology, bioinformatics and virus related projects for many years. She, guided us through the whole project such as the experimental design and human practice arrangements, providedas facilities for conducting the experiments,  and covered the experimental cost. She is responsible for guiding computational modeling and experiments.       As our primary PI, Prof. Xiaofeng Dai has been devoted to precision medicine, synthetic biology, bioinformatics and virus related projects for many years, and will guide us through our project as well as providing facilities for conducting this project.
Secondary PI
Jingwen Zhou
As our secondary instructor, Prof. Jingwen Zhou is an expert in synthetic biology and often offered us some help in conducting our wet experiments.
Shaoqing Xiao
As our secondary instructor, Prof. Shaoqing Xiao is an expert in cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) and device manufacturing. He was mainly responsible for the construction and operation of our plasma device to make sure that no risk would be encountered during our experiment.
Student member
Di Huang
Enjoy the process.
As the team leader, Di Huang is responsible for coordinating all aspects of the preparation during the whole process. She mainly participates in the experiments and HP's work.       She is grateful to iGEM for having such a opportunity to enjoy the whole process of carrying out a complete scientific research project. This also made her more interested in what she has learned, especially in the field of synthetic biology.
Dingchang Shio
The night is long that never finds the day.
Working as a secondary student leader of the team, Dingchang Shi, a junior of biotechnology in Jiangnan University, is responsible for the whole human practice aspects of the project. The interdisciplinary nature of iGEM really appeals to him and he enjoy learning all about the exciting fields of synthetic biology. Besides, he likes making friends and believes that it is a good opportunity to meet so many friends with shared hobbies.
Nan Zhang
Abeunt studia in morse.
Nan Zhang, a sophomore in Jiangnan university,works on experimental operation and human practice in this team. She is very interested in synthetic biology and biomedical engineering. From a very young age she was captivated by the charms of science and decided to devote herself to science and pursue a scientific career. Her dream is to be a lively, lovely and charming scientist.
Ying Xu
Man proposes, God disposes.
Ying Xu is in her second year of a bachelor of biotechnology in Jiangnan University. She, works on wet lab, human practice and wiki text preparation in the team. She wants to work on biomedicine research in the future. Thus, the experience of taking part in iGEM can be very fascinating and rewarding to her. In her free time, she likes baking, reading and listening to gentle music.
Yini Luo
Nothing is impossible, if you put heart into it.
Yini Luo is a second-year student in biotechnology. As a member of the experimental group and human practice group, she likes exploring and solving scientific problems, especially, problems related to biology. She believes that scientific creativity comes from our life and it will change our life. That is why she is obsessed with synthetic biology.
Bingyan Shen
Tomorrow comes never.
Bingyan Shen is a junior student majoring in clinical medicine. In our iGEM team, she works for the experiment and human practice. Because she is the only one studying medicine in our team, we need her to provide us with various information and knowledge about medical issues during the experimental process. She believes that the combination of biology and medicine will promote the progress of life sciences.
Zhenyu Wang
Genius can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and unlock the secrets of the universe.
Zhenyu Wang is a junior in Jiangnan university. Majoring in arts, he serves as the stylist in our team, works on creating new ideas everywhere. He considers design as an approach to convey one’s feelings rather than design itself. He never thinks he is a fan of myth but a stylist of the world. In this team, he begins to know more things about synthetic biology, and he makes it an exciting experience in his way to the peak of art.
Danchen Li
It's never too late to be what you want to be.
As a sophomore majoring in biotechnology, Danchen Li is the head of wiki-making and responsible for mathematical modeling. Although she loves biology undoubtedly, she also enjoys contacting with different areas and learning different new skills. With her open mind to new fields and multi-skills of biology, design and coding, lots of her ideas have been adopted in this project
Yawen Xiao
True liberty is to have power over oneself in all things.
As a sophomore majoring in computer science in Jiangnan university, Yawen Xiao takes part in the web page group in our iGEM team. Our team members always consider him as a geek because he is crazy about code and he is really interested in algorithm. During his free time, he likes playing table tennis with different people and after that he can devote himself to algorithm again.
Chunchao Ma
What I’m doing right now, I’m chasing perfection.
In this team, Chunchao Ma has worked as a biological model and a web page builder. Although his major was not related to biological knowledge, he adapted to the team quickly.
