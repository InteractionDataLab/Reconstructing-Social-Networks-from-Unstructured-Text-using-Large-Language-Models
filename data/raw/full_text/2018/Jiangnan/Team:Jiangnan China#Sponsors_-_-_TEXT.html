    Thanks to Jiangnan University for supporting our team. At the beginning of the 2018, the school of biotechnology intends to form two teams to participate in the IGEM competition, which is based on the trust of our scientific research ability and concerns about the development of international synthetic biology. In the past two years, with the rapid development of synthetic biology in the world, the number of Chinese participating in iGEM has been increasing, and our university has kept up with the trend of The Times, exchanging and studying with many international universities.
    Thank the school of biotechnology for supporting our laboratory space, meeting room, various experimental equipments and materials, and the financial department of Jiangnan University for supporting our team's funds.
