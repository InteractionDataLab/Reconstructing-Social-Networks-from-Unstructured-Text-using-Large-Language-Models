Broad Spectrum
Both biobricks were successfully constructed, and the Nectin 4 biobrick has been transfected into MDBK cells, and functionally expressed on the surface of MDBK cells as validated by its enabled sensitivity to CDV infection.
Suspension Culture
We identified PABPC1 as the candidate gene responsible for cell suspension through analyzing the RNA-Seq results of adherent and suspended cells from the same line and origin.
We validated that suspended cells have low PABPC1 expression by qPCR.
We validated that PABPC1 under expression can make cells feasible for suspension cultivation.
High Titer
IRF7 expression was sufficiently suppressed.
Virus titer was increased over 2 folds once suppressing IRF7 expression.
Two mins cold atmospheric plasma treatment can further increase virus titer 2.5 folds.
