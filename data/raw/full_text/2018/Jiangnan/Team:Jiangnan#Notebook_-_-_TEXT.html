Day 1 Material preparation: We prepared materials for electrorotation, such as cells (2×106 cells/mL) and plasmid (20 ug) with concentration greater than 1 ug/ul for each sample.
Day 2 Transfection: We transfected MDBK cells. After incubation for 12h, we changed cells back to conventional medium.
Day 3 Medium changing: We removed the supernatant from the 6-well plate and replaced it with fresh medium.
Day 5 Test: We observed GFP expression in cells using fluorescence microscopy.
2. Calcium phosphate transfection
Day 3 Material preparation: We seeded the logarithmic growth phase cells in a 6-well plate and cultivated them for 24 h when they reached 50% -70% confluence. We precipitated the plasmid using ethanol and the solution concentration was 500 ng/ul. Moreover, we dried the precipitate in the air.
Day 4 Transfection: We transfected MDBK cells and placed the 6-well plate in the incubator overnight.
Day 5-6 Medium changing: We removed the supernatant from the 6-well plate and washed cells twice using D-PBS, and replaced it using fresh medium.
Day 7 Test: We observed GFP expression in cells using fluorescence microscopy.
Result:    The results are shown in Fig 2. The transfection efficiency of the lentivirus transfection method was 70%, which is the highest among all tested approaches. The efficiency was 40% using electroporation transfection, which is lower but adequate. The efficiency of the liposomal transfection method was only 4% and the calcium phosphate transfection method was 1%, which are too low to be accepted. Though lentivirus has the highest efficiency, we used the electroporation approach in the following precedures as the lentivirus method is time-consuming.

Week 5-6
Optimum antibiotics screen concentration determination
Day 1 Cell seeding: We seeded the logarithmic growth phase cells in 96-well plates for 100 ul per well and cultivated them for 24 h when they reached 50%-70% confluence.
Day 2 Dosing: We set nine groups and three parallel wells in each group, and added antibiotics G418 to reach different concentration gradients in each group, i.e., 0, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.4 g/L.
We changed the fluid every three days and added antibiotics G418 at the same time. When cells died after 7-10 days of dosing, the dosage was considered the optimum screen concentration.
Result:
As seen from Fig 3, after G418 selection for 7 days, the cell survival rate of the experimental group at a concentration of 2 g/L or more was close to 0%. Thus, 2 g/L of G418 was selected as the screen concentration.

Nectin 4 mRNA and protein expression detection
1. Nectin 4 expression detection at the transcriptional level in genetically modified cell strain using RT-PCR
We designed the primers of the RT-PCR using the Primer-blast function in the NCBI website and submitted it to Suzhou Jinzhizhi Biotechnology Co. Ltd. for synthesis. The primers used in this test are shown in Table 5.
Table 5. Primers in this study.
2. PCR amplification products test using agarose gel electrophoresis
We seeded MDBK cells (negative control) and MDBK-N4 cells on six-well plates and cultivated them until 80%-90% confluence. Then, we extracted the total RNA of the cells using the TIANGEN RNA simple (DP149) Kit. Afterwards, we reversely transcribed RNA (1 ug) to cDNA with Titanium® One-Step RT-PCR Kit and amplified Nectin 4 and GADPH using PCR where reverse transcription PCR primers were used as the primers and cDNA was used as the template. Finally, we tested the PCR amplification products using agarose gel electrophoresis, observed and analyzed it using a gel imager.
3. Nectin 4 expression detection at the translational level using Western blot
We seeded MDBK (negative control) and MDBK-N4 cells in six-well plates and cultivated them until 80%-90% confluence. We lysed cells with lysate RIPA to extract and quantify proteins. We took the protein sample (30 ug) to perform polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred the desired protein to a PVDF membrane using an electrorotometer. Following that, we washed the membrane three times with TBST and blocked it with TBST containing 5% skim milk for 2 h. After blocking, we washed the membrane three times with TBST and incubated it using a primary antibody at 4°C overnight. After incubation with primary antibody, we washed the membrane three times using TBST and added the secondary antibody to incubate it for 1.5 h at room temperature. Then we washed the membrane three times using TBST. It was observed that Bcl reagent developed color using a chemiluminescence gel imager.
Result:
1. RT-PCR results are shown in Fig 4. When the cDNA of MDBK-N4 cells (the 10th generation) was used as a template for PCR, lanes 2 and 4 showed the expression of both Nectin 4 and GAPDH. When the cDNA of MDBK cells was used as a template, lanes 1 and 3 showed only GAPDH expression. This indicated that Nectin 4 was expressed at the transcriptional level in MDBK-N4 cells.

Nectin 4 and viral coat protein expression detection and TfR primer design
1. Nectin 4 sample preparation: We seeded MDBK (negative control) and MDBK-N4 cells on 96-well plates and cultivated them until 50%-60% confluence. Then we observed Nectin 4 expression.
2. Virus coat protein sample preparation: When cells grew to 70%-80% confluence, we washed cells once using PBS and inoculated them with CDV(50 ul). After virus adsorption for 1 h, we replaced the medium with DMEM medium containing 2% FBS and cultivated cells until significant lesions appeared.

Immunofluorescence results are shown in Fig 6. Compared with control MDBK cells (Fig 6A), Nectin 4 (green light) was expressed in MDBK-N4 cells (10th generation) (Fig 6B). Enlarged results are shown in Fig 7. Nectin 4 in MDBK-N4 cells was mainly distributed on cell membrane, encompassing the blue-emitting nuclei (Fig 7B). This indicates that MDBK-N4 cells can stably express and transport Nectin 4 to cell membrane.

The immunofluorescence results are shown in Fig 8. After CDV infection for 3 days, MDBK-N4 cells (the 10th generation) developed obvious pathological changes. Some anoikised, most were drawn, and the virus coat protein (green light) was distributed inside cells. It was demonstrated that Nectin4 protein expressed by MDBK-N4 cells is functional, i.e., it does function as a virus receptor. It was observed that CDV replicated and proliferated in cells to generate progeny virus, which infected the surrounding cells and resulted in cell apoptosis.

Week 6
We used Lipofectamine 2000 to transfect cells with siRNA but failed as the transfection efficiency is too low. As shown from Figure 4, the relative mRNA expression of PABPC1 in BHK-21 adherent cells were quite different between using Lipofectamine 2000 and Lipofectamine 3000. Thus, we decided to use Lipofectamine 3000 in the following experiments.
Figure 4. PABPC1 expression using different transfection reagents. PABPC1 expression was much lower using Lipofectamine 3000, which indicated that Lipofectamine 3000 was better than Lipofectamine 2000 in siRNA transfection.
Suspension Culture
Week 7-8
Day1   Cell seeding：We seeded cells when cells’ confluence reached 30%-50% in logarithmic growth stage after cultured for 24 h.
Day2   Transfection: ‘A’ solution was prepared by mixing 3ul Lipofectamine 3000 with 100ul fresh medium and then adding 0-100 nmol siRNA into 100ul fresh medium to prepare ‘B’ solution. ‘AB’ solution was mixed and incubated in a 6-well plate at room temperature for 1 min, then the supernatant was removed.

Week 5-6
Week 5-6 Fast virus titer examination approach establishment
The process of obtaining genomic DNA by dissociating viruses using standard kit（such as GenElute™ Mammalian Genomic DNA Miniprep Kits）s expensive and time-consuming, which is not suitable for high-throughput detection. Thus, we are motivated to develop a fast virus titer examination approach. This approach is established, with details described in our protocol.
Tables 3 and 4 show comparisons between the traditional and our fast detection methods.
Table 2. Ct values of virus PCR examined using standard kit. ‘Ct’ refers to Cycle threshold, ‘Ct AVG’ means the average of Cycle threshold, ‘CV’ represents coefficient of variation.
Table 3. Ct values of virus PCR measured by our fast method. ‘Ct’ refers to Cycle threshold, ‘Ct AVG’ means the average of Cycle threshold, CV’ represents coefficient of variation.
The CV of our fast examination approach (CV = 0.9 and 0.71 for both samples) has less CV than the traditional approach (CV = 2.2 and 1.42 for both samples), suggesting that they are stable and reproducible. Further, compared with the traditional method, our fast method is less costly, easy to operate and time-saving.
This approach is now under patent protection in China (201810377315.6) and under patent application in USA.

Figure 4. Fold change of virus titer after plasma treatment. Treatment time of 30s and 40s were compared.
DNA of IBRV replication increased nearly 2 folds after plasma treatment for 40s. However, it seems that the fold change has not reached the plateau. Thus, we decided to prolong the treatment duration in the following experiments.

Week 8 Cold atmospheric plasma parameter exploration
We seeded cells in 12 hole board, with 200,000 / hole, and tested the efficacy of plasma on virus titer at five treatment time points, i.e., 60s, 90s, 120s, 150s and 180s.
We found that the highest virus titer achieves when the treatment time is 120s.
