When we all met for the first time in January, we were just 14 people from different academic backgrounds with the aim ofho wanted to learning more about synthetic biology and what it’s like to work in the lab. We didn’t really know were not aware of what is exactly ahead of us such as what we were getting ourselves into – and that so many unsuccessfulsuccessive failures in PCR’s, disappointing sequencing resultsthe experiments, exhaustiveng lab work and non-sleeping nightsnights and quite a lot of discussions and quarrels were ahead of us. </P><P>Now we’veAfter worked together for almost 8 months’ teamwork, and have really become a teamwe become friends and form a family. Despite of some inevitable problems and issues, we have overcomame many problems encountered during this process. We difficulties and realized a project we’are now very proud of ourselves and feel excited to have the chance and honour to present our work at the Giant Jamboree in Boston. </P><P>Most of us were part of We are divided into different subgroups, like including Lab, Wiki andor Human Practices. We have learned a lot during this process, and learned heaps of new thing，but of course iGEM wasn’t only about work –  andwe participated in several great events, like such as the Asia Pacific meetup in Taiwan and Chinese Conference of iGEM Community. Besides, wWe did quitehad held a fewseveral teambuilding activities and had a lot of fun together. All in alTaken together,l joining iGEM isit was an unforgettablea valuable experience time, which has left us with many cherishable memories and helped us to growwe made many new friends along the way and gained valuable experiences.</P></DIV><DIV class="col s10 offset-s1"><H1>PI</H1><DIV class="single-member Jeffect-4"><DIV class="Jmember-info"><H3>Xiaofeng Dai</H3></DIV><DIV class="Jmore-info"><P>As our primary PI, Prof. Xiaofeng Dai has been devoted to precision medicine, synthetic biology, bioinformatics and virus related projects for many years.
