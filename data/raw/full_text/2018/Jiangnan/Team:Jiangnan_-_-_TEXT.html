Project Description
The limiting factors of most vaccine companies, according to our previous investigation and survey, are     mulitifaceted costs in actual production process and long product lift cycle and other issues due      to complex application process of new vaccines(cell line).
The goal of our project is to enable three features of our chassis cell, i.e.,high titer, suspension cultivation, and      broad spectrum to reduce the production cost increase the yield of viruses for vaccine production. The chassis cell we used here is     MDBK cell.
Broad Spectrum
Suspension Culture
High Titer
Broad Spectrum
Through text mining, we classified cell receptors according to the Baltimore subtyping of viruses and summarized the primary receptors mediating the entry of different types of viruses. After systematic analysis, we aim to express Nectin 4 and Tfr on our chassis cells to make them possible to a broad spectrum of viruses.
Suspension Culture
Through high throughput sequencing of two pairs of cells with and without the suspension feature, we found a panel of genes responsible for the suspension feature of cells following network construction using computational approach. The top gene was functionally validated before applied to the chassis cell for genomic modulation.
High Titer
Through bioinformatics analysis and mathematical modeling, we constructed the network regulating virus titer of cells. The top gene was selected, functionally validated in vitro and used for genomic modulation in the chassis cells to enable them the feature of increased titer. On the other hand, we manufactured a device to generate cold atmospheric plasma, using which cell titer was further increased in response to plasma irradiation.
