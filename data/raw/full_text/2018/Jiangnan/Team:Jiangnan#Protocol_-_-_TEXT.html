1.IBRV detection by our fast detection method
(under patent protection)
(1)MDBK cells were cultured according to the conventional method. IBRV was added to cells when cell confluence reached 90%, and the supernatant was removed after cells completely exfoliated.
(2) The supernatant was put under 3 fold gradient dilution using 1640 medium, resulting in 5 gradients, numbered 1-5. Take 100 uL culture from each dilution to 500 uL centrifuge tube, and repeat this process for three times.
(3) The culture was boiled for 10 min, centrifuged at 10,000 RPM for 5 min. 15 uL supernatant was placed in a clean 200 uL centrifuge tube as the template for fluorescence quantitative PCR detection.

3.siRNA transfection
using Lipofectamine 2000
Use this brief procedure to transfect Stealth RNAi or siRNA into mammalian cells in a 24-well plate. All amounts and volumes are given on a per well basis. Use this procedure as a starting point; optimize transfections as described in Optimizing Stealth RNAi or siRNA Transfection.
(1) One day before transfection, plate cells in 500 µl of growth medium without antibiotics until they reach 30-50% confluent.
(2) For each transfection sample, prepare oligomer-Lipofectamine 2000 complexes as follows:
A. Dilute 20 pmol Stealth RNAi or siRNA oligomer in 50 µl Gibco™ Opti-MEM™ I Reduced Serum Medium without serum (resulting concentration of RNA in Opti-MEM is 400 nM). Mix gently
B. Mix Lipofectamine 2000 gently before use, then dilute 1 µl in 50 µl OptiMEM I Reduced Serum Medium. Mix gently and incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature. Note: Proceed to the next step within 25 minutes.
C. After the 5-minute incubation, combine the diluted oligomer with the diluted Lipofectamine 2000. Mix gently and incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature (solution may appear cloudy).
(3) Add the oligomer-Lipofectamine 2000 complexes to each well containing cells and medium. Mix gently by rocking the plate back and forth.
Incubate cells at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 24-96 hours until you are ready to assay for gene knockdown. Medium may be changed after 4-6 hours.
Optimizing Stealth RNAi or siRNA Transfection
To obtain the highest transfection efficiency and low non-specific effects, optimize transfection conditions by varying RNA and Lipofectamine 2000 concentrations. Test 10-50 pmol RNA and 0.5-1.5 µl Lipofectamine 2000 for 24-well format. Depending on the nature of the target gene, transfecting cells at higher densities may also be considered when optimizing conditions.
Scaling Up or Down Transfections
To transfect cells in different tissue culture formats, vary the amounts of Lipofectamine 2000, nucleic acid, cells, and medium used in proportion to the relative surface area, as shown in the table. With automated, high-throughput systems, a mixture volume of 50 µl is recommended for transfections in 96-well plates.
Note: You may perform rapid 96-well plate transfections by plating cells directly into the transfection mixture. Prepare complexes in the plate and directly add cells at twice the cell density as in the basic protocol in a 100 µl volume. Cells will adhere as usual in the presence of complexes.

4.Plasma
1 ml blank DMEM medium was added to the 12-hole plate and placed directly under the low temperature atmospheric pressure plasma generator. The distance between the end of plasma beam and the medium is 1 cm, the injection port is vertically aligned to the center of the hole in the 12-hole plate, the controlled helium flow rate is 1 slm / min, and the output voltage of the high frequency power supply controlled by the transformer is 0.96-1.24kv. Plasma activated medium (PAM) could be obtained by repeating the aforementioned process. When cells were incubated with the viruses, the active oxygen and the active nitrogen in the culture medium had a beneficial effect on virus replication. 500000 MDBK cells were placed in the 6-hole plate for 24 hours. Then the original culture medium was changed to 1 ml PAM. IBRV were then added and incubated with MDBK cells for 1 hour before changing the medium to the maintaining 1640 medium (supplemented with serum at 2% final concentration). The culture was collected for virus titer detection after cell lysis.
