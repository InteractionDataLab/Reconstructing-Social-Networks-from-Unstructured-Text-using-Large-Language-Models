Achievement
    In the project, we discovered a new effective acid tolerance gene—msmK，which can improve the survival rate of Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 by 213.67 times at pH 4.0. And we constructed a promising food-safe grade chassis microorganism Lactococcus lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmK-cspD2, which can provide more solutions to the acid and cold stress problems in fermentation industry. Besides, we also obtained two patents in the industrial application of Lactic acid bacteria.       (Patent number: 201811026830.6 & 201811042938.4)
