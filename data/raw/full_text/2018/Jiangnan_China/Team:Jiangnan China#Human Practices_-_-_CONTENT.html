        In order to promote synthetic biology and iGEM, we held a preaching meeting about synthetic biology and iGEM for the students came from all faculties in Jiangnan University. At the meeting, we had a total of three parts. The first part was to introduce iGEM and synthetic biology to the students. The second part was brainstorm, which let students think about our project's innovative points and flash points based on our project's background. The third part was a free exchange session. Students can communicate with us about things related to our project and team. After this meeting, the innovation of our project is sublimated further.<P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="dcpt3" style="font-size:20px;line-height:1.5;font-family: 'spr';"><DIV align="left" style="font-family: 'spr';font-size:40px;border-bottom:2px solid #584b4f;"><STRONG>2.

We also had a small meeting with ZJUT, DLUT, and LZU in Jiangsu Normal University. What’s more, we cooperated with some universities abroad, such as Unesp Brazil, Kyoto University Japan. In short, these communications are positive, meaningful, and very helpful to the improvement of our projects.

We also got tons of new ideas from other participants by communicating with them and listening to their presentations. In addition, we learned a lot from the speech of Ambassador of the iGEM HQ and top scientists from the field of Synthetic Biology.    All in all, we had a productive and enjoyable experience and gained lots of inspiration at the 2018 6th Asian-Pacific iGEM Conference!</DIV><DIV class="dcpt3" style="font-size:20px;line-height:1.5;font-family: 'spr';"><DIV align="left" style="font-family: 'spr';font-size:40px;margin-top:-80px; solid #584b4f;"><FONT size="6">（2）CCiC</FONT></DIV>    From August 27th to August 31st, we attended the fifth CCiC held in ShanghaiTech University.

As a group of creators, we devoted ourselves to producing an anti-acid and anti-cold chassis microorganism. To achieve that tough goal, we need to not only spend a ton of time in the lab but also do something relative to the society who will be our real beneficiary. Therefore, we took some actions.

Yakult's live probiotics have strong acid resistance. Because of company secrets, we can't know how its acid resistance was improved. It is known that it is screened from many strains, which gave us some inspiration.

After discussion with the marketing staff, we learned that Lactococcus lactis has a large share of the probiotic market.

He told us the application regulations and policies of genetically engineered bacteria, which made us realize that genetically engineered bacteria cannot be eaten directly, which caused substantial changes in the direction of our project. We no longer stuck to the probiotics direction and try to find new application directions.

We have initially explored the possible application of our project in pharmacy, such as making a live vaccine, etc. They gave affirmation, especially in the safety, and also proposed some problems, which is also the problem we need to solve in the future.

And they raised the issue of safety, not only the safety of the bacteria, but also the emissions of the natural environment, and they encouraged us to add a suicide mechanism, which was consistent with our idea, so we considered the suicide mechanism in the design of subsequent experiments.
