It is significant for synthetic biology to develop a reliable and repeatable measurement, the same to all the other engineering disciplines. We Jiangnan_China have volunteered to test some devices that are intended to make gene expression more precise and reliable by measure the expression level of GFP, in order to help the iGEM community collect data about how reliable will these devices turn out to be in labs around the world.
