    Our team consists of 7 students majoring in life science and 5 students majoring in design, Internet, digital media. We get more inspiration when different professional ideas collide. We successfully constructed a safe acid-resistant and freeze-resistant plasmid and introduced it to Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 to create a safe chassis microbe. From a project framework to our step-by-step results, validation and presentation on the wiki, each of us played a big role. Thank you!
