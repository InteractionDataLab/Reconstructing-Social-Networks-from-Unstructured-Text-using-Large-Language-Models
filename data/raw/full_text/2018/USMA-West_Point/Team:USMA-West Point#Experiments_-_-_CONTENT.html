Overnight cultures were incubated at 37C with shaking at 220rpm. The following morning, overnight culture was used to inoculate 4 fresh cultures in 20mL minimal media to an OD<SUB>600</SUB> of 0.2. Cultures were grown incubated at 37C with shaking at 220rpm until the OD<SUB>600 </SUB>reached 0.6, when cultures were pelleted by centrifugation (3500xg for 5min), resuspended in PBS and then pelleted again by centrifugation (3500xg for 5min), before being resuspended with minimal containing either arabinose with IPTG (media had no glycerol), arabinose only (media had no glycerol), IPTG (media contained glycerol) only, or water (media contained glycerol). Arabinose had a final concentration of 0.1% and IPTG had a final concentration of 0.5mM. After the media change and addition of either arabinose and/or IPTG, cultures were incubated at 37C with shaking at 220rpm for an additional 3 hours, after which cells were pelleted by centrifugation (3500xg for 5min) for RNA harvest and qPCR analysis.</P><P> </P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Collection of RNA</STRONG></P><P>Cells were pelleted by centrifuging cultures at 3500xg for 5min, and supernatant discarded</P><P>RNA was isolated using RNA Miniprep Isolated Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>cDNA First Strand Synthesis</STRONG></P><P>1-8uL of RNA (3ug RNA)</P><P>1uL Random hexamer primers (ThermoFisher)</P><P>1uL 10mM dNTPs (ThermoFisher)</P><P>Volume adjusted to 10uL with DEPC-treated water</P><P>RNA/NTP solution was incubated at 65C for 5 in a BioRad MyCycler thermocycler, then the following were added:</P><P>2uL 10XRT buffer (ThermoFisher)</P><P>4uL 25mM MgCl2 (ThermoFisher)</P><P>2uL 0.1M DTT (ThemroFisher)</P><P>1uL RNaseOUT (ThermoFisher)</P><P>1uL SuperScript (ThermoFisher)</P><P>Reactions (20uL total volume) were run in BioRad MyCycler thermocycler at:</P><P>25C for 10min</P><P>50C for 50min</P><P>85C for 5min</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>qPCR </STRONG></P><P>All samples were run in triplicate</P><P>Individual samples were prepared as follows:</P><P>0.3uL cDNA</P><P>0.5uL forward primer</P><P>0.5uL reverse primer</P><P>10uL 2XSYBR Green Dye</P><P>8.7uL Water</P><P>Reactions were placed in a 96well qPCR plate (Applied Biosystems) and sealed with microplate adhesive film (Applied Biosystems)</P><P>Reactions were run on an Applied Biosystem 7500 Real Time PCR system</P><P>Data was analyzed using Excel (Microsoft)</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER class="w3-row-padding w3-padding-32"><DIV class="w3-half"><H3>USMA-West Point</H3><P>Team USMA-West Point is the United States Military Academy's iGEM team, representing the Department of Chemistry and Life Science.</P><P>Powered by <A href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp" target="_blank">w3.css</A></P></DIV><DIV class="w3-half"><H3>USMA's Department of Chemistry and Life Science</H3><UL class="w3-ul w3-hoverable"><LI class="w3-padding-16"><A href="https://www.usma.edu/SitePages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">USMA Home Page</A></LI><LI class="w3-padding-16"><A href="https://www.facebook.com/West-Point-Department-of-Chemistry-and-Life-Science-385389195808/" target="_blank">USMA's Department of Chemistry and Life Science Facebook</A></LI></UL></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
