In May, USMA-West Point participated in MIT's Soldier Design competition. The competition enables undergraduate MIT students and USMA cadets to attempt to solve a real world problem for the modern soldier or first responder. This competition afforded our team the opportunity to compete against other USMA and MIT teams, proving to judges that "eNOSE" is a practical method of detecting security threats.
