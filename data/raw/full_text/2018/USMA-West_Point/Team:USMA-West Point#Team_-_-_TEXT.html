Team
Students
CDT Channah Mills '20
Student Leader
Channah is a 2nd class cadet at USMA and has been a member of the eNOSE research team for 2 years. She is a Life Sciences major with a Space Science minor. Channah enjoys being part of the team and continuing to learn more as she continues with the project.
CDT Elizabeth Huuki '20
Student Member
Elizabeth Huuki is a 2nd class cadet at USMA in the Behavior and Life Science Department with a pre-medicine track. She is currently on her third year of research with eNOSE. She primarily does bench work and enjoys applying concepts learned in class to a real world problem.
CDT Alanna Appel '20
Student Member
Alanna Appel is a 2nd class cadet at USMA in the Behavioral Science and Leadership Department. Although she majors in Engineering Psychology, she is interested in the bioengineering process and has been a part of the eNOSE team for a year. She primarily performs benchwork in lab under the mentorship and supervision of Dr. John Cave.
CDT Bailey Schieve '21
Student Member
Bailey is a 3rd class cadet at USMA who is new to the research team this year. She is majoring in Chemical Engineering within the Chemistry and Life Sciences Department. She is excited to learn more about the research process and expand her knowledge of science!
CDT Rich Delzell '20
Student Member
Rich is a 2nd class cadet at the USMA pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Life Science with a pre-medical track.  He worked on a redesign of a bioreactor aimed at demonstrating that an MEA can be used to measure olfactory cell response to olfactants. He is excited to continue working with on the project and gaining additional laboratory experience outside of the classroom.
CDT Matt McDonough '20
Student Member
Matt is a 2nd class cadet at USMA in the Chemistry and Life Science Department with a focus in Life Science. He spent some time as a USMA Liaison at NRL last year.He has worked mainly with the computer-aided design and wiki aspect of this project, but is looking forward to working on the bioengineering side of it.
CDT James Pruneski '19
Student Member
James is a 1st class cadet at USMA in the Mathematical Sciences Department with a focus in Life Science. He spent time last year observing this project, but now serves as a student-advisor.
