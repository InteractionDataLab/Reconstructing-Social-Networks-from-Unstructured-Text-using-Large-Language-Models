ATTRIBUTIONS
The fulfillment of all the objectives that we set ourselves at the beginning, would not have been possible without the help of some people who supported us with our project. We thank all the people at Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas-ESPE and some other institutes, that actively helped us with the conclusion of our project.
Dr. Francisco Flores.-
Dr. Flores has been supporting us  since the formation of the team. He has contributed extensively in various  ways, especially by guiding us in the search of relevant information for the  realization of the project. He has always been there helping us with a variety  of problems that have arisen throughout our work.  For the experimental part of our project and  some other aspects, he has helped us to seek collaborations with other  institutes, and has given us access to the laboratories from the university, and  also to his lab of Molecular diagnostic, IDgen.
Dra. Alma Koch.-
An investigator from the  microbiology area, she is in charge of the microbiology lab from Universidad de  las Fuerzas Armadas –ESPE. In addition to her constant support, she has  collaborated in an essential way by facilitating access to the laboratory and  allowing us to use all the necessary reagents.
Ing. John Andrés Trujillo
Eng.  John Andrés Trujillo,  the wiki master! He has collaborated with us in the creation of the wiki,  transcribing and making real our ideas, developing it in the most colourful and  interactive manner, as well as promoting our creative potential always whit a great  attitude. Thank you for the nights that you stayed awake whit us.
Heber Torres.-
His lectures allowed us to get  involved in the world of synthetic biology and form a knowledge that could be  applied in this project. A very important contribution was his help in the  design of the G-Blocks, since some doubts arose about whether they were correct  and he collaborated reviewing and supervising the design.
Special Thanks
We would  also like to thank Dr. Carlos Noceda, researcher at Universidad de las Fuerzas  Armadas –ESPE, who has taken part in the formation of the project and has  contributed with various advice regarding the development of research that has  been very helpful.
To Dr. Lucy  Baldeon, who belongs to the department of biomedicine of the teaching hospital  of Calderon, located in Quito, with whom we had an approach to carry out trials  and with whom we intend to make a future application of the product we develop.
To Dr.  Marbel Torres, researcher of the area of human biotechnology at Universidad de  las Fuerzas Armadas –ESPE, for helping us with the quantification of the  developed protein, taking advantage of the BCA method.
For Dr  Linda Guaman, our secondary PI and researcher at the Technological University  Equinoccial of the UTE. Thank you for all the knowledge imparted and the  openness to work in your laboratory, especially for allowing us to use the  fluorescence plate reader, without which we would not have been able to perform  the InterLab.
