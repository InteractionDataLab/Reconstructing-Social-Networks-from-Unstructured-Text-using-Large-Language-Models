Participation in laws
In this section of human practices we focus on the development of a proposal to improve laws that require clarification or correction of concept. For this we work together with members of the Ministry of the Environment of Ecuador, participating in this way in the formation of the criterion on synthetic biology and digital information of sequences of genetic resources in Ecuador.
 
In addition, a document was formulated with the proposed amendments to the law, which was delivered to the Ministry of the Environment of Ecuador for analysis by the corresponding Minister.
 
In the process of this part we were able to have conversations with the Association of Biotechnologists of Ecuador who communicated their support in correcting the document presented to the Ministry. We have managed to participate in the formation of the criterion on synthetic biology with the experience of being the first project carried out in the country of this nature, giving it valuable information, in addition a document that is under evaluation to improve the conditions for the realization of synthetic biology was provided in the country.
Socialization of the project in  the industry
The participants of the course realized an exercise that had as objective to see what would be the probable applications that they would give from their field of work or expertise of the work area. The main ideas found were:
Cellulose linked to proteins capable of capturing heavy metals
Cellulose as a mesh to stimulate growth and inhibition of plant pathogens
Cellulose anchored to antimicrobial proteins
Cellulose suit with water repellent proteins for waterproof materials
Cellulose condoms with antispermic proteins
Cellulose for water filters that can capture pathogens
Cartilage and muscle regenerating cellulose
In addition, we also talked with doctors belonging to the Hospital to verify if the product would be applicable in the bone regeneration and for a possible collaboration in the future for the preclinical and clinical phases, to which they were very enthusiastic with the project and are looking forward to the finalization in the future to begin collaboration.
