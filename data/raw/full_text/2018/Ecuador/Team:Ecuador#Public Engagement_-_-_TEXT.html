Conclusions
Overview
For the part of the diffusion of synthetic biology our team focuses on three activities
Great Diffusion
Diffusion in educational centers
Dissemination through courses
Massive diffusion
For mass dissemination, two media were used, the main one was the Facebook page identified as iGEM Ecuador, in which information about synthetic biology and its applications is placed, as well as information from the team. The page reached around 700 followers from different parts of the country.
The second medium was an interview conducted by some members of the team on the Television Channel, Teleamazonas, to talk about synthetic biology and its applications, as well as the project that will participate in the Giant Jamboree
 
Dissemination in educational centers
A talk was prepared for 6 educational centers, one University and 5 colleges, between which it is estimated that the talk was reached for around 400 students, in addition to about 50 teachers from the different educational centers

Dissemination through courses
We worked on the creation of a theoretical-practical course in conjunction with our sponsor IDGen that allows us to disseminate the most useful techniques as tools for the development of synthetic biology, also to reach a greater number of people from different parts of the country. There were 5 courses with a capacity for 10 people, reaching 50 people by this media.
Conclusions
With these activities without taking into account the broadcast of the interview on television, it is estimated that the message has reached about 1200 Ecuadorians in the country. It should also be noted that at least one person from each province of Ecuador was reached, demonstrating that our dissemination reached all parts of Ecuador. Finally, it is estimated that with the interview the real number of people reached with the message will be fivefold.
