Introduction
Bone and cartilage regeneration
Elasticity
Cellulose production
INTRODUCTION
The aim of our project is to obtain a novel bone and cartilage regeneration treatment. The path we take to carry out this was transforming E. coli to produce a fusion protein, conformed by a cellulose binding domain and a protein that induce chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, also a fusion protein conformed by CBD and an elastin like protein was design in order to obtain an elastic biomaterial. We also tried to produce cellulose in E. coli to have a better control in its production with a LacI repressed promoter. The parts are briefly described below (see the part page if more information is needed).
Fusion protein for bone and cartilage regeneration
Coding parts
BBa_K2804000
CBD cipA with a C-terminal linker
This part was design to try to improve the imperial college (2014) CBD cipA part  BBa_K1321014, because the CBD N-terminal is where the protein binds to the cellulose and the linker could interfer with this interaction.
BBa_K2804006
Superfolder GFP with six-histidine tail
The adition of an histidine tail to part BBa_K1365020 was done because it allows the characterization of fusion proteins binding sites through atomic force microscopy, thanks to its affinity to the equipment nickel tip.
BBa_K2804002
Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2)
Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), is a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) super-family. It is involved in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in vitro via the expression induction of Sox9, Runx2 and its downstream markers.1
Composite parts
