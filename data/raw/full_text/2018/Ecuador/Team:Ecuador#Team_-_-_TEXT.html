MEET OUR TEAM
We are the first team to represent Ecuador in iGEM! Our team is formed by eight passionated and dedicated undergrad students. As newbies, it was a challenge and an unforgettable experience to participate in iGEM 2018. Our teachers, instructors and advisors were the driving force behind each day to continue, without them, we would not have achieved it. So thanks from the heart.
Students
Estefany Paredes
She is a caring person that believes in people, with  values and principles of faith, full of joy and enthusiasm for learning. Tefi  is a biotechnology engineering student one of the youngest members of the team  and the Student leader.
Her favourite place in the world are the Galapagos  islands, and her favourite animal the sea lions. She will do her major in  marine biology and she wants to focus her career by developing new technologies  that allow to conserve and defend the environment. She enjoys her weekends  travelling, practicing dance and theater, volunteering in dog shelters and  studying Chinese 你好!
Nicolas Lopez
Nico is a curious  young man who likes to learn new things every day. Lover of nature and the  simple things in life. Cheerful and hyperactive, enjoying what he does at every  moment. A fan of playing music and watching movies, strolling through the Quito’s  downtown and going for an ice cream. Since he was a child  sent attraction for science and now he is here. He is one of the most important  members of our team, we are glad to have him.
Natalia Torres
She is Nati, she is studying biotechnology engineering  in University of the Armed Forces "ESPE". She is one of the founding  members of the synthetic biology team and she is interested in bioinformatics.  She participated in human practices, interlab and some activities in the  laboratory. She is very kind and supportive. She likes to dance and sing. In  her free time, she reads romantic novels, fantasy sagas or manga, watches  anime, k-dramas and many movies.
Juan Carlos Luzuriaga
Juanca is a  21-year-old student of biotechnology engineering. He is interested in learning things  and improving himself whenever he can. In his free time, he likes to ride a  bike, visit new places and fill his life with new experiences.
He joined the team  because he wanted to learn about synthetic biology and improve his knowledge of  biotechnology, also, because he wanted to gain more practical experience in the  lab and project development. Since he is one of the newest members he has been  learning from the oldest members and dedicate his time to contribute with any  given task.
Jennifer Tapia
She is 22 years old. Jenni  loves the 80’s music, she really loves the cats because they are fun and great  animals and obviously she has one, and she loves her major, biotechnology  engineering, because it gives her the opportunity to change the world. For this  reason, she has been part of the team of Synthetic biology from ESPE for 2  years. Now as member of the iGEM team Ecuador, we are working on improving the  certain fields of medicine with our project. Our objective is to improve the  medical attention with new ideas based on the power of Synthetic biology in  creating new ideas for treatments and general health care.
Diego Garzon
He is a student of  Biotechnology on “Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas- ESPE” in Ecuador.  Diego considers himself as a dedicated and  determined person, who does not stop easily when he encounters obstacles. In  the team he is responsible for the work related to human practices, also  collaborate with his experience in the work of the laboratory. His preference  in the scientific field is obviously synthetic biology, metabolic engineering  and industrial biotechnology. In his free time, he likes to play sports like  soccer and watch different series and animes.
Camila Velandia
Cami is part of the iGEM Ecuador-2018  student team. She was born in Colombia, but almost all her life She has lived  in Ecuador. She studies Biotechnology Engineering at the University of the  Armed Forces-ESPE. She considers herself a charismatic, fun and dedicated  person. She really likes sushi, dancing, singing and horse riding. Ecuador is a  small beautiful country, with very good and happy people, we will do our best  to leave the name of our country on high.
Gabriel Guaman
Gabo is an  undergraduate engineering in biotechnology student. Since a little kid, always  pursue the path of sciences and musical fields. Since every drop of knowledge  obtained during his whole career might be helpful in the iGEM contest, he  believes that not only he will show the world the team developed idea, but also  get to know the work of other teams, and gain much more acquaintanceship.
Primary PI
Francisco Flores
Graduated  with a major in Biotechnology Engineering from Universidad de las Fuerzas  Armadas-ESPE in 2008. Obtained a M. Sc. in 2010 and a Ph. D. in 2014, both from  the Entomology and Plant Pathology Department at Oklahoma State University. He  has published several articles in scientific journals including MPMI, Plant  Disease, and Phytopathology. He is a reviewer for international scientific  journals related to plant pathology and crop science. He received many academic  awards including best researcher in 2017 from ESPE, the Outstanding Thesis  Award in the Plant Sciences category and a Distinguished Graduate Fellowship at  Oklahoma State University. Currently he is a professor at the Life Sciences and  Agriculture Department at Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas- ESPE where he is  involved in research related to biodiversity, plant pathology, bioinformatics,  molecular biology, and synthetic biology. Former coordinator of the Ecuadorian  Bioinformatics Network-REBIN, and tutor of the synthetic biology iGEM team at  ESPE
The best PI ever! We can't thank him enough for all that he has done. Thank you very much!
Carlos Barba Ostria
He is a synthetic biologist with broad scientific interests, his passion is creating new production paradigms and reducing the impact of unsustainable production technologies on the environment and on human health, by engineering biological systems. He has formal training in Experimental Biology (B.S, Mexico), Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (Ph.D., Mexico) and Synthetic Biology (Postdoc, USA and Brazil). His life goal is to advocate for the responsible application of scientific knowledge to improve life quality and environmental restoration, particularly in developing countries of Latin America.
Instructor
Francisco Mosquera
Francisco developed a  passion for working with microorganisms and molecular biology methods after being  research assistant at the Microbiology Laboratory and IDgen. He obtained the  Food Safety Internal Auditor ISO22000:2005 degree by August, 2016. One year  later, in September 2017, he took part in the Global Community Biosummit whose  goal is to provide an space for the evolution of do-it-yourself biology.
Confounder of "Plan Seta", created in an effort to replace some plastic products  using mushroom mycelia of Ganoderma and Pleourotus species, he is working for  running a biotech startup in the near future. Last year, the Plan Seta team won  the Bayer Young Community Innovators contest organized in Ecuador.
His collaborations to  the project involve the dry-lab work building the mathematical modelling, the  designing and wet-lab work assembling the constructs that are being coupled to  bacterial cellulose. He also participated as instructor in the course of  Molecular Biology techniques that the group designed for ecuadorians interested  in Synthetic Biology.
On the social side,  when Francisco has spare time he enjoy spending time whit friends or watching  and training mixed martial marts.
Secondary PI
Carlos Arroyo
He studied Physics at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid where he earned his Ph.D. degree in 2010 working under the supervision of Prof. Nicolás Agrait. After that he completed two postdoctoral research fellowships at TUDelft, working with Prof. Herre van der Zant, and at Columbia University, working with Prof. Latha Venkataraman. Since june 2015 he works as a professor and researcher at the CENCINAT located at the Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE. His scientific interests are focused on the study of electronic, magnetic, mechanical and optical properties of nanoestructures, seeking to establish the knowledge base required to develop novel technological applications.
Linda Guamán
She is Linda Guamán, MSc. and Ph.D. in Microbiology. She defines as a scientist passionate about microorganisms and nature. Her main research interest is  Engineering microorganisms for the production of high valued chemical compounds such as biopolymers, biofuels, probiotics, etc., through synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and the use of CRISPR Cas9.
