INTRODUCTION
The main goal of our work is to develop a functionalized cellulose-based biomaterial for bone and cartilage regeneration in order to allow a faster injuries recovery time and overcome remaining challenges in repairing these connective tissues. In biomedicine, emergent strategies have focused the use biomaterials loaded with drugs.1-3 We aimed to use bacterial cellulose, a biocompatible biomaterial, as scaffold for the delivery of the human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2). It is worth to note that the diffusion of a drug far of the action site can become ectopic tissue formation, representing a serious problem. Therefore, we focused to attach the BMP2 by the use of a cellulose binding domain (CBD). We choose the CBD of the scaffolding protein of C. thermocellum (CBD cipA) because the higher affinity compared to other CBDs, reported by the Team Imperial_2014. Moreover, in an effort for a longer broad application of a functionalized bacterial cellulose, such as wound healing, we also fused the CBD cipA with an elastin like polypeptide (ELP_C5) derived from the ELP- [V-150].
RESORBABLE BACTERIAL CELLULOSE

High levels of cellulose is the first module of our project. Thus, we have focused to cotransform two plasmids in E. coli BL21 (DE3) because it is resistant to toxic proteins. The firs plasmid is  the operon bscABCD for cellulose biosynthesis while the second one is conformed by the genes Cmcax and CcpAx which are members of the cellulose synthase complex and allow an enhanced cellulose production rates.4,5 Because the difficulties of chemical synthesis in four of the six genes, it was necessary to add aptamers at 5’ ands 3’ and the Gibson assembly, using psb1c3 as the host vector was delayed.  To date, we have successfully assembled the plasmid containing the genes Cmcax and CcpAx.
Furthermore,  we started the atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis of the bacterial  cellulose, analyzing its topography as the first step to approximate the total  cellulose binding sites where the fusion protein will bind. This analysis will  allow us to know the drug concentration in the cellulose.6
The way we are obtaining resorbable bacterial cellulose membranes is using electron beam irradiation.7 This work is being a collaboration with hospitals of our country where there are electron beam accelerators which are used for cancer treatment.
FUSION PROTEINS
CBD cipA-BMP2
Figure 2. Tridimensional structure of CBD cipA-BMP2 obtained from the server I-Tasser.
Two  gBlocks were synthetized for in-frame protein assembly. The first gBlock  consisting of lacI promoter, RBS and CDS of CBD cipA while the second gBlock  containing the CDS of BMP2. Both of them were codon optimized for E. coli.
Because it has been demonstrated that the  C-terminal domain of BMP2 provides osteogenic activity, 8 we intended  to leave it free. Thus, it was necessary to fused it C-terminally to an  N-terminal CBD.10 We decided to choose the CBD cipA because the  higher affinity to bacterial cellulose compared to other CBDs that was reported  by the team Imperial 2014.10
The CBD cipA has originally two linkers. The N-terminal linker is a signal sequence typical of the bacterial extracellular proteins while the C-terminal linker separating the CBD cipA from Coh3 module.
Then, in contrast to the team Imperial 2014, we decided to use only the C-terminal linker hypothesizing that this can provide a better binding strength than the use of two linkers.

CBD cipA-sfGFP
Figure 2. Tridimensional structure of CBD cipA-sfGFP  obtained from the server I-Tasser.
The gBlocks synthetized for in-frame protein assembly corresponded to the first gBlock consisting of lacI promoter, RBS and CDS of CBD cipA; the second gBlock containing the CDS of sfGFP with a 6X His tag. Both of them were codon optimized for E. coli.
We aimed to add a 6X His tag at C-terminus in order to visualize and measure at single-molecule level the interaction between the CBD cipA and bacterial cellulose.6

CBD-ELP_C5
Figure 6. Tridimensional structure of CBD cipA-ELP_C5 obtained from the server  I-Tasser.
ELP_C5 was obtained via overhang PCR using primers containing prefix and suffix in RFC25, and the plasmid pET-24a-ELP[V-150] as template.
Each ELP undergoes a Tt that leads to its aggregation or solubilization. The Tt of an ELP fusion protein is different to that of the free ELP depending of the surface accessible surface. Because we aimed a future clinical application of ELP fusion proteins in aggregated state, we decided to use ELP[V-150] with a Tt=28.2℃,11 lower than the corporal temperature. However we have cloning a 450 bp fragment of ELP[V-150] and we expect a similar Tt.

CHARACTERISTICS OF C-lastin
In an effort to overcome the  unsolved challenges in bone healing that are mainly derived from pathological  and age related events, C-lastin takes advantage of the biocompatibility of  bacterial cellulose to develop a functionalized biomaterial for bone and cartilage  regeneration.
The principle of C-lastin is a  post-hoc functionalization of a chimeric protein formed by a CBD and the human  BMP2 with bacterial cellulose functionating as scaffold.
The fusion protein containing the  ELP_C5 attached to bacterial cellulose via CBD cipA can confer elastic  properties to the biomaterial tapping it for biomedical applications such as  wound healing.
