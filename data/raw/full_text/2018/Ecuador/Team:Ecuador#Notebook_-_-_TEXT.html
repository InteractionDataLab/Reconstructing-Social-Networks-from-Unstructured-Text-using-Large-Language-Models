●      Domestication of the gBlocks (CBD cipA, BMP2, sfGFP). With the objective that the restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI can cut gBlocks forming cohesive ends, we perform a PCR to add their recognition sites. But in the design, we did not know that there should be base pairs that flanked a restriction site, therefore, the first test failed, but with the proper investigation we discovered this observation, then sent to request primers to add those bases in prefix and subfix.
