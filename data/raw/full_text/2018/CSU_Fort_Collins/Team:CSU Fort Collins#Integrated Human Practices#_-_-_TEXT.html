Awareness:
In order to gain a greater understanding of how our project would be perceived by the public we conducted a survey on our campus. The survey asked questions to get a better sense of general knowledge of antibacterial resistance, quorum sensing, as well as public opinion regarding the safety and comfort level with these types of genetic manipulation. The results showed that most individuals felt comfortable with synthetic biology even amongst those who were not well-versed in the discipline. Out of the 48 students sampled the average knowledge of genetic engineering was 4.55± 2.65 on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being no knowledge of genetic engineering and 10 being well-versed in this area of study. Out of this sample of students, we found that the average level of comfort with developing a system to search and kill specific bacteria was 8.55±1.42 out of a 1-10 scale. Although only a preliminary study, we were reassured by the public’s positive perception of our research project and continue to be excited about pursuing research to combat antibiotic resistance in a responsible manner.
