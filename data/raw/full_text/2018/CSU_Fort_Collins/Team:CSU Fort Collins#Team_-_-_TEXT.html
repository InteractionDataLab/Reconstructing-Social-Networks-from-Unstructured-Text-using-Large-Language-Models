Christie Peebles, Ph.D.
Department: insert
Research Interests: insert.
Department: Chemical/Biological Engineering
Research Interests: Dr. Peebles' research is focused in the areas of metabolic engineering, secondary metabolism, regulatory networks, and systems biology in plants, bacteria and yeast for the production of bio-based chemicals and fuels.  More specifically, these areas can be divided into 2 main applications.  One application is the use of plant metabolic engineering to produce important pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals.  The second is the engineering of photoautotrophs for the production of bio-based chemicals and fuels.
