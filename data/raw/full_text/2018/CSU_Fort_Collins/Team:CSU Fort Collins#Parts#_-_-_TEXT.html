IPTG Promoter + Agr AC+ GFP
BioBrick part BBa_K2323001 is a composite part of BBa_K180000 and BBa_I746107.  This part allows us to test the expression rate of AgrAC in and determine whether the expression of AgrA can be rate limiting to S. aureus or if only concentration of AIP is the only factor that affects the virulence choice in the bacterium. .
