Getting the Metals
Our team did a miraculous job during the eight months of the SynDrop project. To ease the process of finding relevant documentation we have provided an overview which shows that we have achieved the requirements to be awarded the medals and special prizes at the iGEM 2018 competition.

FULFILLMENT
Bronze
Registration and Giant Jamboree Attendance
Team Vilnius-Lithuania (also known as Komanda X) is ready to attend the Giant Jamboree after having a great iGEM season.
Competition Deliverables
All of the stages of developing the SynDrop idea and presenting it to the general public are provided here, on our wiki page ( https://2018.igem.org/Team:Vilnius-Lithuania/Main ).
We have designed an informative poster in order to convey the idea of our project to the judges and other iGEM'ers.
The story of SynDrop was put into a 20 minute resumptive presentation, which will be held on Friday.
The Judging Form ( https://igem.org/2018_Judging_Form?id=2622 ) was completed responsibly to convince judges we have done our best.
Attributions
People who helped us throughout our project in areas where we needed their competences and advice are presented in the Attributions page ( https://2018.igem.org/Team:Vilnius-Lithuania/Attributions ).
Characterization
The InterLab Study ( https://2018.igem.org/Team:Vilnius-Lithuania/InterLab ) succeeded in identifying and minimizing the sources of systematic variability in fluorescence measurements and the data was accepted by the Measurement Committee.
Silver
Validated Part
We have sent 48 BioBrick Parts : 25 basic parts and 23 composite parts. They can be found here ( http://parts.igem.org/cgi/dna_transfer/one_batch.cgi?batch_id=5321 ) and used by all in the iGEM community.
Collaboration
We had 6 bi-directional and uni-directional collaborations with iGEM teams from different countries! All collaborations with descriptions can be found on Contributions ( https://2018.igem.org/Team:Vilnius-Lithuania/Collaborations ) page.
Human Practices
While passing on our experience to pupils and celebrating DNA Day with the community, we presented our project as widely applicable cell-free system. The "DIY-science" workshop successfully encouraged people to try scientists' daily routine, as well as inspired us to educate them outside the laboratory.
Gold
Integrated Human Practices
Inspired by discussions with the stakeholders during the DNA Day celebration, we had organised the international life sciences BioHackathon which helped spawn the base for our software tool LipoVision ( https://2018.igem.org/Team:Vilnius-Lithuania/Software ).
Improve a previous part
While using an existing BioBrick Part OmpA_full-His, we have created a new one ( http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2622047 ) by adding Mstx to it.
Model your project
We created several models that characterize and improve different parts of our project: membrane protein insertion, liposome synthesis through microfluidics, BamA transcription/translation in IVTT systems and efficiency of thermoswitches. All models can be found on our wiki page ( Model ).
Demonstrate your work
Numerous experiments were conducted to ascertain that our system is functionally active. We obtained indisputable results and demonstrated that MPs can successefully be inserted into the liposome membrane and therefore can perform their intended function. SynDrop both works and complies with all rules and regulations approved by the iGEM Safety Committee. All results can be found in our wiki page ( https://2018.igem.org/Team:Vilnius-Lithuania/Demonstrate ).
