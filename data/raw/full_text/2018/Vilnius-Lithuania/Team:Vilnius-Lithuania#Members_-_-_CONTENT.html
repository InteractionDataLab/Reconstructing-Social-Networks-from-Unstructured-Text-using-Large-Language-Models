                     However, to our surprise, recently he moved to the German countryside to pursue his PhD dream.
                     It turned out to be a right choice after he magically made every wet lab experiment work in
                     iGEM. Outside the lab, Gabrielius nailed every single sport branch and was the single worthy
                     opponent of Simas at foosball. As a prize for remarkable performances, Gabrielius used teams’

                     filling plates with LB Agar last year to becoming a mastermind of the project this time. Don‘t
                     be screwed up – his heart can turn from feather to stone in minutes and nobody will pass into
                     silence or stay without assignments. On the contrary, there are 4 words and 14 letters that
                     everyone desires to hear from Justas: „Food’s on SynBio“. We are also thinking about running a

                     She is also a true hidden gem of our team, as none of us have ever witnessed such pipetting
                     skills in our entire lifetimes. If you ask her for help with the interlab, wet lab or even
                     human practices, she never waves away. And when you introduce an idea to her, she always laughs
                     friendly in the beginning. We never understood, if it was a good sign or bad.

                     death. That might be a dark hint how her nickname „Johnny“ came along. Sometimes she also went
                     missing for a few days. We used to call her numerous times and check local police reports until
