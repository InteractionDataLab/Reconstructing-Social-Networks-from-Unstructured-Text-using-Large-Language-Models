These Amazing People
This year our team was kindly assisted by lots of people,  including ones from Vilnius University, non-governmental organizations, specific area specialists from the private sector and even our friends or colleagues.  These amazing people helped us in areas we struggled or in the moments we needed an extra pair of hands. We want to give a special thanks to the people without whom SynDrop project would not be the one it is now.

Description
Special Thanks
Dr. Linas Mažutis
Sector of Microtechnologies
Even though Dr. Mažutis was mostly working abroad, he never hesitated to find extra time for an internet call and give some fundamental advice in the field of microfluidics. The opportunity to work in the microfluidics’ laboratory was also invaluable for building our project.
Dr. Gintaras Valinčius
Department of Bioelectrochemistry and Biospectroscopy
Dr. Gintaras Valinčius was always optimistic about our team and was always curious about the current state of our project. Despite Dr. Valinčius busy schedule, he was always willing to help in any way he could. His expertise in membrane science was particularly helpful.
Professor Edita Sužiedėlienė
Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Prof. Edita Sužiedėlienė’s support has been invaluable to Lithuanian iGEM teams since the establishment of the first team back in 2015. She has been kind enough to let us use her lab regularly and was patient about missing equipment after intensive work routines.
Tadas Penkauskas
Department of Bioelectrochemistry and Biospectroscopy
Tadas Penkauskas’ experience in membrane-based science and willingness to help with any matter related to lipids and membranes always helped us move further. Additionally, Tadas’  bulk-synthesized liposomes were a powerful tool to test our membrane proteins in higher throughput, while our method was still being developed.
Aistė Skrebytė
Head of Rector’s Office at Vilnius University
Aistė Skrebytė was the person at the Vilnius University Rector’s office that we could rely on. She helped our team with financial questions - team’s registration, Giant Jamboree-fee payments, and many others. She was always there for our team and tried to find best solutions to our organizational difficulties including our trip to Boston and general PR strategy.
