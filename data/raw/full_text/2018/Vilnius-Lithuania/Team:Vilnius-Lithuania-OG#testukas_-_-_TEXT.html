None of us is as smart as all of us
Synthetic Biology has come a long way already...
2000
First genetic circuits
2010
Bacteria with synthetic genome
2013
Commercial Artemisinin production
2016
Light activated communication
in synthetic tissue
Yet, incredibly complex synthetic systems
that will define our century...
... require a tremendous amount of
well defined biological parts
However, characterization and unique
part creation is not an easy task...
... as Nature is immensly complex.
A small protein of 100 amino acids
Has 20100 possible sequences
That's already a far greater number
than there are atoms in the known universe
Current methods are relatively slow
compared to the data amount we need to explore!
We can either use traditional methods
and collect data for another hundred years...
...or take a step in another direction...
DNA library of uncharacterized
and unique catalytic biomolecules
Each different DNA molecule is
swiftly encapsulated into water droplets
Each different DNA molecule is

dsad
Catalytic Biomolecule is produced
inside of the droplet
Recording Module measures the
activity of the Biomolecule…
…and then records it into the
biomolecule’s DNA sequence
The recorded activity and
sequence of biomolecule is
retrieved by Nanopore Sequencing
