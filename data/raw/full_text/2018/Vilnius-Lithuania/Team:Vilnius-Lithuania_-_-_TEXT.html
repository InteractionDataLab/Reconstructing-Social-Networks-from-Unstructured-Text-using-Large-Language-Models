Outer Phase
OA solution (outer aqueous) carries surfactants that stabilize the initial formation and propagation of the droplets along the microfluidic device.
Inner Phase
IA phase (inner aqueous) contains elements required for the synthesis and integration of membrane proteins.
Lipid Phase
LO phase (liquid ordered) consists of octanol and lipids that form a lipid bilayer.
