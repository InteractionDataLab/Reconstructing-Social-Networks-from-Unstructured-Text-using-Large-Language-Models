First, we have created a model to determine microfluidics variables for optimal liposome synthesis. Second, we synthesized stable biocompatible liposomes and demonstrated an internal transcription and translation of functional proteins. Third, we demonstrated that membrane proteins can successfully integrate into our liposomes. Finally, we constructed working fusion proteins that were able to display a designated tag on the outer membrane.

Moreover, critical value of flow rate ratio was found (Q = 0.7), at which liposomes stopped forming.

To prove that synthesis of proteins is viable, we performed GFP protein synthesis inside our liposomes and recorded measurable fluorescence. Additionally, purified GFP was encapsulated to prove high encapsulation efficiency. To validate membrane protein integration into the membrane, pore forming membrane protein a-hemolysin was inserted into liposomes and the leakage of fluorophore molecule calcein was recorded in the outer solution. </P><DIV class="image-container"><VIDEO width="100%" controls=""><P><STRONG>Fig. 2</STRONG> High throughput synthesis of liposomes with customly modified OLA method.

&lt;img src=" https:=""><P> Proteins that possess ß-barrel structures do not fully denature in the presence of SDS if they are unboiled, which leads to unorthodox movement in SDS-PAGE. As BamA only forms ß-barrels when correctly folded, we can evaluate the amount of protein correctly folded and incorporated into the liposome membranes by the amount of unusual product in an SDS-PAGE.

As liposomes feature the same lipids as E. coli membranes, and during our project were successfully incorporated with Bam complex proteins, it appears that these proteins will be able to expose fused protein particles as, if not more, efficiently as in bacteria, laying the foundation to reach new molecular evolution horizons.
