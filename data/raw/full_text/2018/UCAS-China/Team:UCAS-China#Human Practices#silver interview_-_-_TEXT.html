INTERVIEWS
From talks with art-major students to survey aiming at science-major students, from interviews with scientists from Chinese Academic of Science to collaboration with artists from Art and Science Research Center, we devoted to making our voice heard by more people outside the lab.
Art-major Student Interview
We have a talk with an art-major student from Academy of Arts & Design, Tsinghua University. Her opinion was absolutely new for us and drove us to think deeper and wider about the relationship of art and science. She told us that there have been a group of artists and art-major students attempted to create art-and-science work. Some of them had been acknowledged widely, but the depth and amount were still limited.

Key points:
Both expression approaches but different tools
Inspiration and method expansion
Information visualization
Prof. Pingsheng LIU Interview
To seek the most precise point to cut in, we interviewed Prof. Liu from Institute of Biophysics CAS, who is experienced in popularization of both science and art. He told us that just as Joseph L. Goldstein said in 2015 Lasker Award Ceremony, “The most original scientists (and artists) in our day discover newness by blending existing knowledge with imaginative thinking.” Art and science are connected primely by imagination. That`s exactly the original motivation of our story.

Key points:
Imagination
Blending existing knowledge with imaginative thinking
Fancy gene circuit and imaginative way to present
Prof.Jun YU Interview
Nowadays, the society tendency is that science and art are considered more and more split, which led to a narrow and limited situation. If we are determined to bend this tendency, we must think carefully about how to balance the relationship of art and science in our project. This led to our interview with Pro. Yu from BIG. As the chief scientific advisor of Art and Science Research Center, he indicated that we should explore the novelty and the unique art value of our work, both scientifically and artistically.

Key points:
Public concern
Novelty which distinguishes it from traditional art forms and science work
Addition of designs dynamic changes, the structure of space
Prof.Lewis Sander Interview
Enjoying his class of both English writing and Beyond Science, we invited Lewis Sandler to have a discuss with us upon science and art. He drove us to think about the Process of observation, creativity, exploration. He made us to cherish the situation where we were seriously creating something and enjoying the process.

Key points:
Observation, creativity, exploration
Find practicality and value
Think about and enjoy the Process
Discussion with Art & Science Research Center
Art & Science Research Center is the first non-profit association of art and science research center in China. Aiming at “Promoting change through cross”, AS Research Center integrates creation and communication. By means of innovative science and technology also avant-garde artistic creation, they promote the popularization of scientific knowledge and the high cross-integration between different subject fields.
Introduced by Prof. YU, we invited artists from Art and Science Research Center to explore the unique art value of our project. We appreciate sincerely for their advice and guidance in this pioneering field. They invited us to their center. We were deeply impressed by their significant work in inaugurating the age of Science Renaissance. We invited them to be our advisor, hoping to have further collaboration with them.
They were quite interested in our project, while they also pointed out the significance of the interaction with the public practically and more importantly, emotionally. Collaborating with them, we came up with the presenting form of story-telling deriving from Oscar Wilde’s story, The Nightingale and the Rose, which easily rises the audience’s emotional sympathy. Also, choosing the rose as the symbol of our story, for it is well accepted as the symbol of love and art. Blending emotional art value with scientific work indeed bring the soul to our project.
Key points:
Interaction
Storytelling and emotional sympathy
A typical symbol for wide popularization
Giving soul to project
