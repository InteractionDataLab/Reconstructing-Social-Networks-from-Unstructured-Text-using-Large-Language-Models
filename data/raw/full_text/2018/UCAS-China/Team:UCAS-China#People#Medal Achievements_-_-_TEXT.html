✅We have prepared presentation to show at the Giant Jamboree.
✅We have completed the judging form.
⑶ Attributions:
✅A project attributions page is included in our wiki, which contab information on how team members and other people contributed to our project.(See Attributions )
⑷ Characterization/Contribution:
✅We participated in the InterLab study.
✅We put forward new ideas of the tandem expression of chromoprotein, to get new colors, which would enrich greatly the colors and the parts in the Registry.
✅We characterized the Red-, Green-,Blue light sensors (Cph8, YF1, CcaSR) which already exist in the registry, by exploring the relationship between the fluorescent intensity with the wavelengths of input light. (See Contributions )
Silver
