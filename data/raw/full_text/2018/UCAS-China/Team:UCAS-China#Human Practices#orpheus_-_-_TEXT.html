ORPHEUS
Survey
Having a general concept of the fusion of art and science, we did a survey among high school students who attended our lecture activity in the summer camp and most of whom were science-interested. We were gladly to see that the idea was not unfamiliar for them.
Many of them had enthusiasm in presenting scientific principles, data or phenomena in artistic way (See Figure 1). Also, they had unique understandings about the relationship between art and science (See Figure 2). But contrary to the high proportion of students who showed great interest in blending art with science (See Figure 3), their real experience was quite limited due to the serious inadequacy of chances and resources to get involved in such activities (See Figure 4).

Orpheus
Having communicated and discussed with real artists, we came up with the idea of presenting our work through a story and using the rose as the symbol to capture the emotional sympathy of the audience. What’s more, artists indicated that they were interested in the sound part in the story. They suggested that in the aesthetic domain, the synesthetic image, as a new metaphorical image, provides much novelty for the subject's aesthetic experience. How to introduce music to our project to make our story a well-developed one? And how to provide the chances for the public to easily get involved in the creation of art-and-science blending work?
The two considerations motivated us to create Orpheus, see more in the Software Page .
