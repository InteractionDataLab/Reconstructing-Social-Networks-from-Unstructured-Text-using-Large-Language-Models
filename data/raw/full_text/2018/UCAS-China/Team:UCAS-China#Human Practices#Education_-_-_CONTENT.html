Cooperating with the volunteering association of UCAS, iGEMers from UCAS-China became volunteer teachers to bring basic but fantastic knowledge about synthesis biology to those young students on May 23th.
</P><P>
On May 23th, some iGEMers from UCAS-China took part in the voluntary activities organized by volunteering association of UCAS and taught basic but fantastic knowledge about synthesis biology to those young primary school students. The complex theories behind those amazing phenomena may be too difficult to them, but we firstly brought synthetic biology into their world. It was interesting for them to know that it can do so many amazing things like making bacteria colorful or smelling like lemon. Hoping this will be the initiation of their scientific life.

</P></DIV><H3>Giving speech in summer camp for high school students:</H3><P>On July 27th, UCAS-China came to UCAS Summer Camp for High School Students, where gathering high school students coming from all over China with a science dream. Our speech provided them with a new concept of synthesis biology.</P><P>Given the current situation of limited influence of iGEM and synthesis biology among Chinese high school students, we gave a speech in UCAS Summer Camp for High School Students, hoping some of them might be attracted and become iGEM in the future, doing the most fantastic and meaningful project ever. We invited our advisor Meng Fankang to complete the speech with us. With vivid introduction and fancy projects, our speech successfully stimulated listeners’ interest. Looking at their curious eyes, we were glad that our effort to set forward their starting line was meaningful.
</P><H3>Giving speech to students of other majors:</H3><P> 
 On June 28th, an iGEMer from UCAS-China gave a speech about iGEM and synthesis biology as the final presentation of her writing course. Synthesis biology was known and thought by other students step by step with our effort.

</P><P>
To broaden the influence of iGEM and synthesis biology and facilitate the communication and collaboration with other majors, we decided to start from our university. On June 28th, the final class of the writing course, one of the iGEMer of UCAS-China gave her presentation of Let’s talk about synthesis biology and iGEM. Her speech was a good access for other students to know about what we were devoting to.

</P><H3>What is color- 3 minutes for science: </H3><P> UCAS-China took part in the “3 minutes for science” activity held by Institute of Physics Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing Association for Science and Technology etc organizations. Our video about color and interesting knowledge bind it, won prize.
</P><P> Aiming to collect videos which introduce scientific phenomenon to the public and encourage more creative work about science popularization, Institute of Physics Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing Association for Science and Technology etc organizations held a “3 minutes for science” activity. We UCAS-China team present our video “What is color”, which concerning the scientific knowledge of how colors produced by pigments and how we human see this colorful world. Once our video was put into the Internet, in total      people “like” it and we won      prize finally. It’s a meaningful attempt in science popularization, which as important as scientific research itself.
 </P><H3>Science videos- fun but serious science popularization:</H3><P> We made many videos to teach anyone who is interested in synthetic biology the most basic things in labs such as the usage of clean bench and pipettes, how to do PCR or the way to extract plasmid.</P><P>Making video is a popular and efficient way to share ideas and popularize science. We also made some videos to teach anyone who is interested in synthetic biology the most basic things in labs such as the usage of clean bench and pipettes, how to do PCR or the way to extract plasmid. But different from other videos, we had our own way to make scientific experimental guidance more interesting and much easier for understanding. Our audience spoke highly of them and encouraged us to share more ideas and anecdotes in the lab. Click to learn and have fun with us!
