iGEM shows us that there is a much colorful world outside the lab. And exploration of art and science led us to a rose forest. We brought our roses to lecture rooms of university and high school, to science institutes also art center, to a nationwide platform also Internet. Our roses are sparks of creation, bridges between art and science, entrance of iGEM for the public.
