Parts
We collected and submitted a series of useful parts. The following six composite parts are the most significant with great application and research value.
These four parts belong to four plasmids respectively, which are the components of a light control system with three light control circuits. The first part codes three light sensors, Cph8*（BBa_I15010）, CcaSR（BBa_K2598005） and YF1（BBa_K592004）, which is carried on one plasmid, pJFR1(KX011464), under the promoters of J23106, J23108 and laclq35（BBa_K2598007） to sense red, green and blue light respectively. Cph8, the red-light sensor, is a chimeric histidine kinase that is switched on by infrared (705 nm) light and off by red (650 nm) light. CcaSR, the green-light sensor, is switched on by green (535 nm) light and off by far-red (672 nm) light. YF1, the green-light sensor, is a chimeric histidine kinase that is switched off by 470 nm light and is on when there is no 470 nm light.
The second part contains three RBSs, CGG（BBa_K2598011）, T3（BBa_K2598015） and phIF regulated by PcpcG2-172, PphlF and PﬁxK2 promoters respectively. The phIF is a repressor to switch off the blue-light output promoter when blue-light sensor is switched on. The CGG, in the blue-light circuit, and T3, in the green-light circuit, are both ‘sigma’ fragments, which have the DNA- binding domain and can combine core fragment produced by a resource-allocation system connecting the inputs with the outputs to form a full-functional RNA polymerase. And when σCGG combines the core fragment, they form a full-functional RNA polymerase to induce the expression of the blue-light output. Similarly, combination of σT3 and the core fragment can induce the green-light output.
The third part contains CI, another repressor to switch off the red -light output promoter when red-light sensor is switched on, K1F（BBa_K2510004）, the third ‘sigma’ fragments that can combine with core fragment to induce the red-light output. And these three ‘sigma’ fragments are orthogonal and almost effect each other. This part is regulated by PompC1157 and Pλ promoters.
The forth part is the output part encoding three fluorescent proteins outputs, RFP, GFP and BFP, on one plasmid. It uses DT16（BBa_K2598031）, T7（BBa_K2598024） and DT5（BBa_K2598028） as terminators and PK1F（BBa_K2598030）, PCGG（BBa_K2598023） and PT3（BBa_K2598026） as promotors corresponding to red, green and blue light circuits respectively.
Based on the forth part, the fifth part changes three fluorescent proteins outputs to three kinds of enzymes, including gusA（BBa_K330002）, lacZ（BBa_I732005） and bFMO（BBa_K2598027） that can combine with substrate in the medium to produce red, green and blue color.
Similarly, also based on the forth part, the sixth part constructed by our team this year changes three fluorescent proteins outputs to three chromoproteins, including eforRed, amilGFP and aeBlue.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
ADD PARTS
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:
2014 MIT
2014 Heidelberg
2014 Tokyo Tech
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Part Table
Please include a table of all the parts your team has made during your project on this page. Remember part characterization and measurement data must go on your team part pages on the Registry.
