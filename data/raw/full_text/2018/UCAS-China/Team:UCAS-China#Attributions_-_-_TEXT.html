Team Accomplishments
Project:
The prototype of our project was raised by Yun DONG and Yiyi WANG in our brainstorm session in Feb. 2018. This idea was then modified and improved by Yuanli GAO. Our investigators Prof. Chunbo LOU and Prof. Jiangyun WANG helped in our project design. Our advisors Fankang MENG also offered help in project design.
Experiments:
Our experiments started in July 2017. As our team's leader, Yuanli GAO designed and monitored our experiments. He also did the primary work of data analysis. Our advisors Fankang MENG and Xiaohong LIU gave their suggestions on project design. Our experiments were accomplished with the joint effort of the following 9 teammates: Yuanli GAO, Yun Dong, Ziyi ZHAO, Zpeng XU, Yiyi WANG, Liangpu WANG, Yuyan NI, Zhaoying PAN.
Hardware:
Our hardware was designed by Zhaoying PAN, Yuyan NI, while Shiyang WANG participated in the discussion. Zhaoying PAN and Yuyan NI build the prototype device with accessible materials in our lab. Zhaoying PAN designed and made the final hardware.
Software:
