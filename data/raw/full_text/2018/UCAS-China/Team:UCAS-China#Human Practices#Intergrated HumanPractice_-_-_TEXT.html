Ideas collision with art-major students:
We have a talk with an art-major student from Academy of Arts & Design, Tsinghua University. Her opinion was absolutely new for us and drove us to think deeper and wider about the relationship of art and science.
Key point:
Both expression approaches but different tools
Inspiration and method expansion
Information visualization
Encouragement also challenge from science-major students:
Rely on the platform of UCAS High School Student Summer Camp, we did a research among high school students who were mostly interested in scientific study from all over China. We were glad to find that the unconventional idea of combination of art and science has been well-accepted among the young generation. And many of them were as enthusiastic as us in presenting scientific principles, data, phenomena through artistic ways, and in expressing our perception of the world with both approaches. But they also express the regret of lacking relevant chances in their life to truly engage in such activities.
Key point:
Present scientific principles, data, phenomena in artistic way
Enrichment of form and expansion of audience group
Limited knowledge and practice
Interested but lack chances of engagement
Initiation of our imaginative thinking
Encouraged by the result of our general research, we were confident about the significance of our work. To seek the most precise point to cut in, we interviewed Pro. Liu from IBP, who is experienced in popularization of both science and art. He told us that just as Joseph L. Goldstein said in 2015 Lasker Award Ceremony, “The most original scientists (and artists) in our day discover newness by blending existing knowledge with imaginative thinking.” Art and science are connected primely by imagination. That`s exactly the original motivation of our story.
Key point:
Imagination
Blending existing knowledge with imaginative thinking
Fancy gene circuit and imaginative way to present
Orientation of science-deriving artwork:
To balance the relationship of art and science in our project is not that easy, so it was crucial for us to know how to make our work more attractive, acceptable and influential for the public. This led to our interview with Pro. Yu from BIG. As the chief scientific advisor of Art and Science Research Center, he indicated that “Science serves as a tool while art is the ultimate purpose.” We began to explore the novelty and the unique art value of our work.
Key point:
Science-deriving artwork
Public concern
Novelty which distinguishes it from traditional art forms
Addition of designs dynamic changes, the structure of space
Story maker and soul-bringer:
To explore the unique art value of our project, we had several face-to-face meetings with artists from Art and Science Research Center, who are professional and experienced in this pioneering field. They pointed out the significance of the interaction with the public practically and more importantly, emotionally. Collaborating with them, we came up with the presenting form of story-telling deriving from Oscar Wilde’s story, The Nightingale and the Rose, which easily rises the audience’s emotional sympathy. Also, choosing the rose as the symbol of our story, for it is well accepted as the symbol of love and art. Blending emotional art value with scientific work indeed bring the soul to our project.
Key point:
Interaction
Storytelling and emotional sympathy
A typical symbol for wide popularization
Giving soul to project
