InterLab Study
The goal of the InterLab study is to replicate reliable measurements of fluorescence data using green fluorescent protein (GFP) E. coli. Members of our team performed the InterLab study between June 23 and June 27. The data below was obtained and sent in to iGEM to contribute to a larger data pool. The first thing we accomplished for the InterLab was setting up and executing the calibration portion of the protocol. For the calibration section of the protocol we used an 96-well clear round bottom black plate for measuring our reference point, standard calibration curve, and a fluorescence standard curve. We transformed the plasmid, pSB1C3, into DH5α with the heat shock protocol. The medium we used was LB broth with 25mg/mL chloramphenicol concentration as was recommended in the protocol. For the cell measurement protocol, we used the same issue of well plates as used for the calibration section of our experiment. Lastly, for the colony forming units section, we plated the t=0 and t=6 hours with the appropriate dilution onto plates that contained standard LB broth and 25mg/mL of chloramphenicol. After the cells grew on the plates, we counted the number of CFU’s on each plate and recorded the data.
