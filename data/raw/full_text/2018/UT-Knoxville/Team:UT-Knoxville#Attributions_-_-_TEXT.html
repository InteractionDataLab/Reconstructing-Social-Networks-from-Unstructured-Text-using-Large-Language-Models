The University of Tennessee Knoxville iGEM team started brainstorming our project in March 2018. In May 2018, we began working on the project and performing lab work. The students of the UTK iGEM team were responsible for the majority of the team's work, including but not limited to project design, protocol development, lab work execution, and community outreach organization.  The team also greatly appreciates the support and guidance received from the individuals listed below.

The University of Tennessee Knoxville
Our school does not have an iGEM specific synthetic biology course, but the CBE department offers an introduction to molecular bioengineering course. Courses in the BCMB & Micro departments cover the topics of synthetic biology. BCMB also offers a lab class covering experiments with enzymes, nucleic acids, and membranes and organelles. Methods include chromatography, kinetics, hybridization, sequencing, and immunochemical methods.
