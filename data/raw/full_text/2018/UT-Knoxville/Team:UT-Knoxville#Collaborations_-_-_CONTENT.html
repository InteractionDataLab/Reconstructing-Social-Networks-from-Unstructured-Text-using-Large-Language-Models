The participants included The University of Virginia Team, The Washington University Team, The Liberal Arts &amp; Science Academy (LASA) Team in Austin, TX, and The University of Tennessee, Knoxville Team. Each team practiced presenting their project and answered questions from each team. We discussed the challenges of genetic engineering and the methods used in our research. We discussed our community outreach efforts and events we participated in such as the Ask A Scientist event where we performed demos and discussed involvement in the science community. Each team provided their own useful insight on different aspects of their iGEM experience. The University of Virginia team provided us with insight on making a successful wiki. The LASA team felt that an effective way to find funding was seeking out businesses you had a personal connection to. The Washington University team discussed the importance of outreach and explained what a member had learned traveling with Engineers Without Borders. We also held a guided Q&amp;A session.</P><H1>Questions asked to each team:</H1><OL><LI>As a research team, what roadblocks have you faced so far in the research process?</LI><LI>What funding challenges, if any, have you all faced as a team, and what strategies have you taken to fund your team so far?</LI><LI>In what ways do you think synthetic biology and the STEM field in general can be improved in the southeast region? In what ways do you all think outreach can play a role in helping this region be more accepting of synthetic biology?</LI><LI>How has the iGEM experience helped you current or past members in their career development?</LI></OL><H1>Conference Pictures</H1></DIV></DIV><DIV class="utkIgemFooter"><H1>CONNECT WITH iGEM ON SOCIAL MEDIA!</H1></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
