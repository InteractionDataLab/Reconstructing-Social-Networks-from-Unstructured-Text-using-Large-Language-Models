The University of Tennessee, Knoxville iGEM
iGEM, or the International Genetically Engineering Machine, is an organization the facilitates undergraduate research on synthetic biology. Developed at MIT in 2003, iGEM has grown to include 300+ international teams that research applied biology and present their results at an annual jamboree. UT-Knoxville has sent their team for the past two years presenting a novel biodegradation pathway expressed in E.coli.
iGEM-Knoxville 2018 is returning to participate for the third year. We intend to expand the scope of our by designing and developing new projects dedicated to bioremediation. iGEM is a highly collaborative activity and calls upon the talents of departments from across UT-Knoxville to complete our project and ultimately present at the Giant Jamboree in Boston.
