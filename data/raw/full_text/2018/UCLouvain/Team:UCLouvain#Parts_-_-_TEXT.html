 Overview
In our project we worked with multiple plasmids. We tried different reporter plasmids: RFP and GFP in high and low copy plasmids with different antibiotics resistance genes. We worked also with two different conjugative plasmids: pSW23T           ans pK18mob.
The plasmids used as reporter :
We worked with an Red Fluorescent Protein constitutive generator in the form of the biobrick Bba_J04450 and with the Green Fluorescent Protein generator in the form of a construction of two biobricks R0010, a LacI dependent promoter,               and E0840, a weak RBS promoterless GFP generator.
Both of those construction have been placed in high replicative plasmids backbones: pSB1R3 (with the specific resistance of the backbone R=C, chloramphenicol; A, Ampicillin; K, Kanamycin).
They have also been placed in low replicative plasmids backbones: pSB4R5 (with the specific resistance of the backbone R = C, chloramphenicol; A, Ampicillin; K, Kanamycin).
The submitted parts:
We sent two different biobricks.
The first one, K2654001, is our GFP generator with a weak RBS and a LacI dependent promoter. We used this part to discern our donor with the green color. We wanted a weak RBS to avoid a deflection of the ribosomes from the                   vital translations.
The second one is , K2654002, is a customable sgRNA with a switchable crRNA sequence. This biobrick was used to create two sgRNA’s for txo differnts targets: The RFP Bba_E1010 and the Ampicillin Resistance gene.
