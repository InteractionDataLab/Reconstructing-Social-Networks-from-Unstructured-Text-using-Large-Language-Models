Miniprep
Miniprep were done with Sigma GenElute Plasmid Miniprep Kit           See protocol at https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Sigma/Bulletin/pln70bul.pdf
Enzyme digestion protocols
Digestion were done with NEB (NewEngland BioLabs) enzymes, according to the official protocol           See https://nebcloner.neb.com/#!/redigest
Classical enzyme digestion for 50 µl reaction:
DNA 1 µg
10X Buffer 5 µl (1X)
Enzyme 1 1.0 µl
Enzyme 1 1.0 µl
Nuclease-free Water Up to 50 µl
Incubate at 37°C for 5-15 minutes
PCR protocol
PCR were done with the Q5 DNA Polymerase (from NEB) according to the official protocol.
Ligation protocol
Ligation were done with T4 Ligase (Roche)
Phenol/chloroform purification protocol
add in an Eppendorf tube 20 µl DNA + 380 µl H2O (volume = 400 µl)
add 1:1 volume of phenol/chloroform, vortex, centrifugation 13500 rpm during 2 minutes
transfer supernatant in a new tube
add one volume of chloroform, vortex, centrifugation 13500 rpm during 2 minutes
add 0,2 volume of 10M ammonium acetate + 2,5 volume of cold ethanol (100%), invert tube, and put at -20°C during 30 minutes
Centrifugation at 13500 rpm during 5 minutes, discard the supernatant
Wash 2 times with 1 ml cold ethanol (70%) and centrifuge 5 minutes at 4°C
Discard the supernatant
Quick-spin, remove ethanol
Keep open the tube during 20 minutes to evaporate the ethanol
add 20 µl H2O MilliQ, water bath at 37°C for 15 to 30 minutes
Quick-spin, resuspend DNA and verification of the concentration (Nanodrop)
Transformation with electro-competant cells
Prepare in a 15ml falcon, 250 ul of SOC medium
Defrost 50 µl aliquot of electrocompetant cells
add about 1 µl (less then 1 ng) of plasmidic DNA into the 50 µl of the competent cells
Place it into an electroporation cuvette
Programm the Bio-Rad to pulse 2500 V
electroporate
add the 250 µl of SOC and put back in the falcon
place the falcon at 37°C for one hour
put 20 µl and 100 µl of the electroporated cells on a LB plate with antibiotics
incubate overnight
Electrophoresis gel protocols
Agarose gel used of 0,8%, in BioRad syste
Glycerol stock
Glycerol used at 25%
Conjugation “in plate” protocol
Day 1
Pick up a single colony from donnor, control and recipient strain, grown overnight on LB plates and inoculate in 5 ml of LB with respective antibiotics.
Incubate overnight at 37°C.
Day 2
Centrifuge the preculture 5 minutes at 4000 rpm
Remove the supernatant ( optional : wash 2 times with 1 ml of PBS)
Resuspend the pellets in 3 ml of LB (donnor in excess increase the conjugation efficiency)
Incubate 1 hour at 37°C to regenerate the pili
On LB agar plate, put 5 µl of donnor, control, recipient strain, and put 5µl of recipient + 5 µl of donor strain on top of the receiving strain ( see picture)
Incubate at 37°C between 2 and 16 hours
Scrap the cells and resuspend in 200 µl of LB
Plate each condition in the adequate LB plate and incubate overnight at 37°C
Conjugation efficiency = recipient cells that received the plasmid / recipient cells
Proteinase K protocol
Add 0,2 volume of ProteinaseK (300 ug/ml) (final 50ul) to DNA
Incubate 1 hour at 37°C
Incubate in water-bath at 75°C for 25 minutes for Proteinase K inactivation
Resuspension of insert synthetic
centrifuged the synthetic DNA during 5 seconds at 300 g
add 25µl of water miliQ
incubated during 20 minutes at 50°C
quick spin and resuspend the DNA
DNA purification with Amicon® Ultra-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Devices
Insert the Amicon® Ultra-0.5 device into one of the provided microcentrifuge tubes.
Add up to 500 μL of sample to the Amicon® Ultra filter device and cap it.
Place capped filter device into the centrifuge rotor, aligning the cap strap toward the center of therotor; counterbalance with a similar device.
Spin the device at 14,000 × g for approximately 10–30 minutes depending on the NMWL of the device               used. Refer to Figure 1 and Table 2 for typical spin times.
Spin the device at 14,000 × g for approximately 10–30 minutes depending on the NMWL of the device               used. Refer to Figure 1 and Table 2 for typical spin times.
To recover the concentrated solute, place the Amicon® Ultra filter device upside down in a clean               microcentrifuge tube. Place in centrifuge, aligning open cap towards the center of the rotor;               counterbalance with a similar device. Spin for 2 minutes at 1,000 × g to transfer the concentrated               sample from the device to the tube. The ultrafiltrate can be stored in the centrifuge tube.
