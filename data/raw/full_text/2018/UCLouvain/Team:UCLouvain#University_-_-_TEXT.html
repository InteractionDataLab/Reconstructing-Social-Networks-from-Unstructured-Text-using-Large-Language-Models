Université Catholique de Louvain
Located in Belgium, at a crossroads between Europe’s major capitals, The Catholic University of Louvain (UCLouvain for short) is headquartered in Louvain-la-Neuve, about 30 km south of Brussels. The town, created in 1971 by the university,           offers a unique living environment. It boasts innovative architecture, a town center entirely free from motor traffic with a variety of social and cultural activities. The university also has six other sites in Brussels and Wallonia.
Ranked 153rd in the 2017-2018 QS ranking of the world's universities, UCLouvain ranks first among the French-speaking universities in Belgium. Founded in 1425, UCLouvain is one of the oldest universities in Europe. Erasmus, Mercator,           Vesalius           are some of the personalities who attended her. Georges Lemaître formulated his Big Bang theory and Christian de Duve was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1974.
