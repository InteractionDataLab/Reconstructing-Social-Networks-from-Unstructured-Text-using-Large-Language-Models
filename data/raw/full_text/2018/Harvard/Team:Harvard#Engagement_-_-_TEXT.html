Market Survey
To get a better sense of the demands of potential consumers, we conducted a Primary Market Survey. We personally interviewed pedestrians in and around Harvard Square, as well as in other locations in Cambridge. We asked participants about their purchasing tendencies regarding current skin care products on the market as well as their opinions of a skin care product that would contain active cultures of bacteria. We also collected demographic information. An anonymous synthesis of our results is pictured below along with our survey questions.
BioHackathon Presentation
Harvard iGEM anually hosts a biohackathon for students interested in solving problems with biology. This year, the tracks the teams were challenged to tackle were Defending Against Tropical Disease, Biology without Barriers, Code for Life, and Eco-Sustainability. We were invited to give a presentation on Biosafety and Ethics to get the students thinking about the implications of the projects there were about to begin. We've attached a copy of our presentation below. To learn more about the iGEM 2018 BioHackathon, see here.
