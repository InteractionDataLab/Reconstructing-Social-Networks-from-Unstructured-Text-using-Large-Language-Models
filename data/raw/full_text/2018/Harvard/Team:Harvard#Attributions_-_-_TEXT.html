General Support
Thank you to the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, which generously supported our summer research, and our PI Prof. Neel Joshi for his practical support.
Lab Support
Special thank you to Melissa Hancock, Prof. Alain Viel from Harvard SEAS for dedicating their time to guide us through many experimental procedures. Our mentors Steve Deangelo and Ezekiel Geffken were also integral to the design and execution of the wetlab portion of our project, from construct design to advice on carrying out specific protocols.
Administrative Support
Thank you to Jessa Piaia and Harvard iGEM Clubfor their continous heartwarming administrative and logistical support
Outreach Support
Our successful public engagement workshops in the community could not be made possible without the space and support provided by Boston BioLab
