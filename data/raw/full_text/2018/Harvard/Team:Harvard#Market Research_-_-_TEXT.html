Market Research
On Team Harvard, we believe in the importance of perspective. To aid in the design of our project, we conducted market research and developed a greater understanding of the potential impact of our product. From these measures, we could truly develop a prototype for the most effective solution to the problem. For the purposes of our project, we focused our research on three skin conditions:
Keratosis Pilaris
Seborrheic Keratosis
Actinic Keratosis
Below we present a synthesis of what we've learned about these diseases so that we may properly be able to tacklethe challenges they present.
From these data, it is clear to see a high prevalence of each of these conditions. Unfortunately, many of these effected go untreated due to high medical costs, with those remaining continuing practices of non-compliance.
