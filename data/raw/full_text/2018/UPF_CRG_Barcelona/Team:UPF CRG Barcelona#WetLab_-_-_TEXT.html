Project DryLab Parts Deliverables WetLab Human Practices Team
In the UPF-CRG Barcelona iGEM team, we have been working really hard in the laboratory among spring, summer and autumn. As a result, here we deliver the protocols that have been followed, the lab notebooks keeping track of the whole process, and the techniques used for the measurement of our results.
