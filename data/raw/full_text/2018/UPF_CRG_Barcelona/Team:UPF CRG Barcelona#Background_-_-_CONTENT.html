In fact, metastasis is responsible for 90% of
                  tumor related deaths [1].
               </P><P>Lifestyle factors, such as diet, have been recently proved to have an strong influence on cancer
                  development. The contribution of lipid metabolism in cancer progression has been long known; however, recent
                  evidences suggest that diet-derived lipids can also contribute to the global lipid composition of cancer
                  cells and thus to its development [2]. In fact, novel findings suggest that the acquisition of metastatic
                  potential can rely on dietary long chain fatty acids (LCFA) intake, such as palmitic acid (PA) [3]. 
               </P><P>The exact role of this fatty acids (FAs) in cancer development is not fully understood; however, it has been
                  hypothesized that this aberrant increase of FAs might provide cancer cells with structural substrates for new
                  membranes, signalling metabolites and substrates for FA oxidation in order to fulfill the increased energy
                  demand [4].
               </P><P>LCFA are one of the main components of our food intake. It has been reported that in Western diet, dietary
                  lipids account for 42% of total ingested calories, 95% of which are triacylglycerols, mainly composed of
                  long-chain fatty acids [5]. Considering these evidences and the infeasibility of FAs avoidance by dietary
                  restriction, we hypothesized that targeting FAs availability in the intestine would stop cancer cells from
                  spreading.
               </P><P class="subapart1">What is GARGANTUA?</P><P>In an attempt to propose a safe, effective and affordable solution to metastasis prevention we had the
                  following idea:
               </P><P>What if we could develop a system capable of uptaking PA, acting as a fatty acid sponge? What if we could
                  engineer commensal bacteria that already live in our gut flora to integrate this system in our body?
               </P><P> In this project we aim to design a probiotic with an enhanced metabolism able to increase its LCFA uptake
                  and therefore reducing PA availability in the gut and the bloodstream. By doing so, we could halt tumor cells
                  from becoming metastatic.
               </P><P>Thus, in the course of the project, we have focused on enhancing fatty acid intake, sensing fatty acids
                  intracellularly and integrating this in to a bacteria such that it can be used as a live biotherapeutic.
               </P><P class="subapart1">Design</P><P class="subapart2">Enhancing E. Coli beta oxidation</P><P>In order to enhance <I>E. coli’s</I> own FA degradation machinery we have modulated the expression of the
                  genes implicated in this metabolic process coupling them with an inducible promoter. This way, we have
                  designed a plasmid compatible system containing all the beta-oxidation LCFA family genes.
               </P><BUTTON class="button"><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:UPF_CRG_Barcelona/Overexpression">Read more...</A></BUTTON><P class="subapart2">Long Chain Fatty Acid Intracellular Biosensor</P><P>Our team has developed the first LCFA biosensor that does not interfere with its metabolism. Therefore, we
                  have created the first genetic tool able to analyze LCFA degradation. This represents a powerful and robust
                  system for quantifying FAs, which can be used for high throughput screening of organisms with an increased
                  absorption of LCFA.
               </P><BUTTON class="button"><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:UPF_CRG_Barcelona/Biosensor">Read more...</A></BUTTON><P class="subapart2">A live biotherapeutic</P><P>We asked ourselves what would be the best way to integrate our uptake system into a probiotic strain,
                  addressing challenges that may arise when implementing Gargantua in a therapeutic context. We considered the
                  genomic integration of our design, in order to achieve stable and robust expression and reducing biosafety
                  concerns that can result from plasmid exchange. Thus, complying with current terapeutic standards for
                  probiotic strain characteristics.
