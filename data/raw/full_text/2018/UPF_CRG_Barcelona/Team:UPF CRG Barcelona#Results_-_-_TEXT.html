Overview
When fadL and fadD are overexpressed LCFA uptake increases resulting in                     a higher                     growth if LCFA are the only carbon source available.
pFadBA-luxR-pLux lactone inducible LCFA biosensor can amplify the                     signal of pfadBA promoter-controlled gene expression.
pFadBA-cI-pRM LCFA biosensor reduces a lot the baseline expression of                     genes directly regulated by the pfadBA promoter.
pAR promoter significantly improves pfadBA function as an off/on switch                     dependent on the presence of LCFA.
We used MAGE recombineering to generate a strain missing fadR, in a                     effort to integrate intake capabilities in to the genome.
We applied the PfadBA based biosensor to improve screening of                     recombineered fadR colonies.
Overexpression results
In order to study the functionality of our system we characterized the constructs both in palmitic                 acid (PA) and oleic acid (OA). Bacteria was grown for 3 days in M9 minimal medium with the                 respective fatty acid, to ensure that cells were using solely LCFA as a carbon source .                 Additionally, the supernatant was also collected and LCFA concentration was determined using                 cupric-acetate colorimetric (see methods )                     technique at OD715nm. The same growth assay was performed in LB to infer cell growth in enriched                     media.
Different levels of fad genes expression were achieved through the use                     of different strains. Genetic constructs consisting of either FadD or FadL downstream of the                     tetR repressible promoter were transformed in Top10 (DH5-alpha) and Zn1 E. coli strains                     . Top 10 constitutively synthesizes tetR, which results in a continuous expression of our                     construct. Zn1 does not express tetR, thus meaning that our genetic constructs will not be                     induced in this strain. This induction can be modulated by adding anhydrotetracycline (ATc) in                     the medium. We created a cell library expressing the fadD and fadL proteins:

FadD overexpression increases growth when either PA or OA are the only carbon                 source.
We analyzed the behavior of the constitutive and inducible FadD cell lines with M9 minimal media                 supplemented with either PA or OA. Constitutive reporter cell line was used as a control. OD                 measurements were performed at OD 600 nm as an indicative for cell growth for 72 hours.
Our results show that, when fadD is overexpressed, bacterial growth increases both in 0,4 mM PA (Fig                 1A) and 2 mM PA (Fig 1B) in relation to control. Moreover, non-induced FadD cells show a lower                 increase of bacterial growth, compared to the control. On the other hand, when tested with OA                 medium (Fig 1C and Fig 1D), the difference in growth is higher than in PA medium.
Figure 1 | Growth assay comparing induced and non-induced fadD in minimal medium                     enriched with different concentrations of Oleic Acid (OA) and Palmitic Acid (PA). Figure A                 shows OD600nm over time for induced (top10 strain) and not induced (Zn1 strain) fadD in 0,4mM PA                 concentration. Figure B shows OD600nm over time for induced (top10 strain) and non-induced (Zn1 strain)                 fadD in 2mM PA concentration. Figure C shows OD600nm over time for induced (top10 strain) and                 non-induced (Zn1 strain) fadD in 0,4mM OA concentration. Figure D shows OD600nm over time for induced                 (top10 strain) and not induced (Zn1 strain) fadD in 2mM OA concentration. Error bars represent the                 Standard Deviation of the Mean (SEM).
Moreover, growth in enriched media (LB) was studied. Expression for induced FadD cell line was tuned                 with ATc. Tuneable FadD overexpression levels entailed a big metabolic burden (Figure 2). Our results                 show that when ATc induction increases, growth rate diminishes. This way, our results suggest that even when PA is also available in the media, our system will prefer other carbon sources. However, when LCFA                 is the only available carbon source, the overexpression of fad genes gives a metabolic advantage                 reflected in enhanced growth (Figure 1).
Figure 2 | Growth assay comparing induced and not induced fadD in enriched                         medium (LB). Top 10 cells (DH5-alpha) were grown for 16 hours in enriched medium with a PA concentration of                     0,4mM. In order to induce fadD expression a concentration of 60ng/ml of ATc was added. Error bars                     represent the Standard Deviation of the Mean (SEM).
FadL overexpression increases growth when either PA or OA are used as the only                     carbon                     source.
We analyzed the behavior of the constitutive and inducible FadL cell lines with M9 minimal media                     supplemented with either PA or OA. Constitutive reporter cell line was used as a control. OD                     measurements were performed at OD 600nm as an indicative cell growth for 72 hours.
Here we demonstrate that overexpression of fadL entails a metabolic burden. This is shown in the                     decrease of the OD600 when induced bacteria are grown in both 0,4mM PA or OA (Figure 3A and 3C) and                     2mM PA or OA (Figure 3B and 3D). When comparing this metabolic burden between the two concentrations                     it is clear that in the 2mM concentration induced bacteria grow more than in 0,4mM. Thus, this                     results suggest that FadL entails a metabolic burden even in minimum media but is reduced when LCFA                     concentration increases, as LCFA can be used as an energetic source.

Figure                     A shows OD600nm over time for induced (top10 strain) and not induced (Zn1 strain) fadL in 0,4mM PA                     concentration. Figure B shows OD600nm over time for induced (top10 strain) and not induced (Zn1                     strain) fadL in 2mM PA concentration. Figure C shows OD600nm over time for induced (top10 strain)                     and not induced (Zn1 strain) fadL in 0,4mM OA concentration. Figure D shows OD600nm over time for                     induced (top10 strain) and not induced (Zn1 strain) fadL in 2mM OA concentration. Error bars                     represent the Standard Deviation of the Mean (SEM).
FadD overexpression increases OA uptake
We analyzed the behavior of the constitutive and inducible FadD cell lines with M9 minimal media                     supplemented with either PA or OA. Constitutive reporter cell line was used as a control.                     Supernatant was collected from the medium after 72 hours growing. Cupric-acetate colorimetric                     technique was performed quantify LCFA concentration (OD715nm).
Our results showed that, when fadD was overexpressed, OA uptake nearly doubled the uptake of non                     induced bacteria and control (p <0,001) (Figure 4). However, this increase could not be observed                     in                     PA. A possible explanation would be the infeasibility to obtain a proper standard curve for PA                     using cupric-acetate technique when compared to oleic acid (see methods).

Constitutive reporter cell line (top10) was used as a control. Uptake was measured                     considering the OD715nm difference between the medium at certain concentration of LCFA and                     the medium with grown bacteria. A concentration of 0,4mM of both PA and OA was used.                     Cupric-acetate technique was used to quantify LCFA in the medium. LCFA uptake was                     normalized by the growth of the bacteria, measured at OD600. Error bars represent the                     Standard Deviation of the Mean (SEM). Statistical significance of the mean was calculated                     using a paired t-test. P value < 0,05, which indicates a statistically significant                     difference among relevant groups, is designated with an asterisk.
Overexpression                     of fadL increases OA uptake.
Here to study the LCFA uptake the same experimental procedure was followed as described in                     FadD. Our results show that, when fadL was induced OA uptake was more than 2-fold higher in                     relation to non-induced and control bacteria (Figure 5). This increased uptake was only                     statistically significant in OA when compared to control (p < 0,0001) and not induced                     bacteria (p < 0,0001). PA media didn’t show significant results (Figure 5).

Constitutive reporter cell line (Top10) was used as a control.                     Uptake was measured considering the OD715nm difference between the medium at                     certain concentration of LCFA and the medium with grown bacteria. A concentration                     of 0,4mM of both PA and OA was used. Cupric-acetate technique was used to quantify                     LCFA in the medium. LCFA uptake was normalized by the growth of the bacteria,                     measured at OD600. Error bars represent the Standard Deviation of the Mean (SEM).                     Statistical significance of the mean was calculated using a paired t-test. P value < 0,05, which indicates a statistically significant difference among relevant                     groups, is designated with an asterisk.
Discussion of                     overexpression results
Our results demonstrate that overexpression of fadL and fadD in enriched media                         entails a metabolic burden for the cell. However, when these genes are                         overexpressed in a minimum media with LCFA as the unique carbon sources, the                         metabolic burden is reduced. Furthermore, bacterial growth is even higher                         between induced and not induced cells. We have demonstrated that induction of                         fadL and fadD results in a LCFA uptake increase, being statistically                         significant in OA.
Considering our results, it can be deduced that when fadL and fadD are                         overexpressed LCFA uptake increases resulting in a higher growth. In this way,                         we can conclude that LCFA influx is increased in our system, resulting in                         higher Acyl-CoA concentration inside the cell. Consequently, we have                         hypothesized that this results in an enhanced expression of the rest of fad                         genes and therefore in an increase of the LCFA degradation rate. This increase in the LCFA degradation, leads to more metabolic fuel to be used for growth                         (only when LCFA is the only carbon source available). Therefore, overexpression                         of fadL and fadD gives the cell a positive advantage that results in enhanced                         growing when LCFA is the only carbon source.
Biosensor Results
In order to characterize the functionality of the LCFA biosensors, fluorescent                     proteins were coupled to them. Top10 (DH5-alpha) E. coli expressing the                     genetic constructs were grown for 16-20 hours in LB media with different                     concentrations of palmitic acid (PA). Fluorescence intensity and OD600 were                     analysed at steady state.

Characterization of the Fatty acid acyl-CoA inducible promoter
To evaluate the function of the pfadBA promoter (BBa_K817002) we designed a                     reporter system with RFP (BBa_K2581006).
Figure 6 | E. coli bacteria (DH5-alpha) expressing                     the pFad34+RFP construct were induced with different concentrations of PA in LB                     media. Fluorescence was analyzed once it had reached the steady state (13-15h).
Our results show that the baseline fluorescence intensity of the pfadBA34RFP                     construct is really high. Despite this, an increase of fluorescence intensity was                     observed for increasing PA induction.
Fluorescence saturation could not be observed in the transfer function due to the                     fact that medium with higher concentrations than 1 mM PA generated a lot of noise                     which made impossible to analyse fluorescence at such high concentrations.
Characterization of the Inducible LuxR-pLux engineered device
In order to modulate the expression of the genes under control of the pfadBA                     promoter for different LCFA concentrations, we designed a pfadBA reporter system                     inducible by lux-homoserine lactone (HSL).
Figure 7 |
bacteria (DH5-alpha) expressing the pFfadBA_Lux34_plux_32_RFP construct.
They were induced with different concentrations of HSL and 3 different                     concentrations of PA (0, 0.4 and 1 mM) in LB medium. Fluorescence was analyzed once                     it had reached the steady state (11-13h). Fluorescence intensity values were                     normalized by the OD.
Our data indicates that the activation threshold of the lactone inducible pfadBA                     construct is approximately at 5x10-9 M of HSL. It saturates at 1x10-7 M of lactone. Significant fluorescence difference between different PA                     concentrations is better observed at lactone concentration ranges close to                     fluorescence saturation.
Characterization of the cI mediated activity
In order to reduce the baseline expression of genes under direct control of the                     pfadBA promoter we designed two constructs that together would act as a genetic                     high pass filter. Due to time constraints, we were only able to build the first                     construct of the designed system ( See                         more ). In order to analyse its behaviour we coupled it to a RFP reporter                     protein.
Figure 8 | E. coli bacteria (DH5-alpha) expressing the                         pFadBA+34+CI+ pRM+34+RFP construct were induced with different concentrations                         of PA in LB media. Fluorescence was analysed once it had reached the steady                     state(12-14h). Fluorescence was normalised by the OD.
Comparative study between the Inducible LuxR-pLux, the pFadBA and                     the cI biosensors
Our results indicate that the baseline expression of the pfadBA-CI-prm construct is relatively low. A linear increase of fluorescence intensity is observed for                     increasing concentrations of PA.
Figure 9 | Comparison of fluorescence intensity between                         different pFadBA constructs. Bacteria were grown in LB media with different                     concentrations of PA (0, 0.4 and 1 mM). Bacteria expressing the pfadBA-plux                     construct were induced with lactone 1e-7 M. Fluorescence was analysed at steady                     state. Fluorescence intensity was normalized by the OD.
Figure 10 | Comparison of fluorescence intensity fold                     change (induced/non-induced) differences between different pfadBA constructs.                     pfadBA-plux construct was additionally induced with lactone 1x10-7.
pfadBA-luxR-plux-RFP construct presented the highest fluorescence intensity in all medium conditions and it showed similar fluorescence fold changes after induction                     compared to pfadBA alone. On the other hand, pfadBA-CI-pRM-RFP showed little                     fluorescence compared to the other constructs. Nevertheless, it showed a                     significant fold change increase compared to the other two constructs.
Characterization of the Improved fatty acid acyl-CoA biosensor
We characterised the improved pFadBA promoter, pAR ( BBa_K2581012 ) coupling it to a RFP reporter gene.
Figure 11 | E.coli bacteria (DH5-alpha) expressing the                     constructs were induced with different concentrations of PA in LB media.                     Fluorescence was analyzed once it had reached the steady state (13-15h).                     Fluorescence intensity values were normalised by the OD.
Figure 12 | Comparison of fluorescence intensity fold                     change (induced/non induced) differences between pFadBA and pAR inducible                     constructs.
After induction of the pAR promoter with different PA concentrations our results                     show a significant fluorescence fold change increase compared to the pfadBA                     promoter. Moreover, our data indicates that the baseline fluorescence of the pAR                     construct is much lower than that of pfadBA.
Discussion of biosensor
We have proved that the pFadBa-34-RFP biosensor can detect changes in PA concentration. However, the fluorescence ratio for induced/non-induced cultures is very low due to the fact that the baseline fluorescence intensity is non-negligible . If we expect to use our device as a LCFA quantification system, it is needed to obtain a significant difference in the output signals for different LCFA concentrations. This can be achieved either by amplifying the signal or by increasing the signal fold change between the induction with different LCFA concentrations. We achieved amplification of  the output signal by inducing the pfadBA-luxR-plux-RFP with lactone 1e-7 M. On the other hand, we were able to reduce the basality of the previous LCFA biosensors with our pfadBA-CI-pRM construct. By reducing the baseline fluorescence we observed an increased fold change of the output signals between induction with different PA concentrations. Nevertheless, with this construct the fluorescence signal deemed lower than the other constructs due to the fact that the pRM promoter is weak. We think that we could obtain a LCFA reliable quantification system by coupling the two constructs together. The hypothetical system would work as follows: the first part (pfadBA-CI-pRM-luxR) would increase the fold change concentration of luxR and the signal would be processed by the luxR-HSL inducible plux-RFP reporter system in order to amplify the signal. This system would potentially generate enough fluorescence difference between different PA induction concentrations to make it  possible to predict the concentration of PA in the medium.
On the other hand, we observed that the pAR promoter has a sharper response after PA induction compared to the pfadBA promoter. Moreover, our data suggests that it saturates at much lower PA concentrations than the pfadBA promoter and it has less leakage. Taking all this together, we can affirm that our newly characterised promoter would work much better as an off/on switch dependent on LCFA than the pfadBA promoter, therefore we have successfully improved a previous iGEM parts registry part.
It’s also important to take into account that we have used RFP as a reporter gene, which has a long expression and degradation time. Consequently, this means a delay when reporting LCFA uptake and the moment when expression stops. This is due to the fact that RFP remains some hours in the medium even if it is no longer being expressed. We suggest that a faster reporter protein, the superfolder GFP, which has a very short expression and degradation time, would be more accurate when measuring the switch ON/OFF of our system.
Integration Results
In order to explore the genomic integration of uptake capabilities for a stable chassis that could be used as a live biotherapeutic, we tested the MAGE technology and developed a FadR Knock-Out mutant.
MAGE cycling efficiency:
Estimation of allele replacement frequency (ARF) after each cycle was performed by                     X-gal blue-white                     screening. Oligos encoding for two stop codons in the lacZ gene were electroporated                     in each cycle as a                     positive control. Recombineered colonies are deficient in the Beta-galactosidase                     enzyme and therefore                     appear white when plated on X-gal IPTG containing plates.
Figure 13 | ARF screening on LB+X-gal+IPTG plates after five                         mage cycles in                         EcM2.1 strain. Cultures were plated at 10e-5 (left) and 10e-6 (right).
Cultures where plated after five cycles. ARF was 4.8%, estimated by colony counting                     (Figure 13). This corresponds to                     ~1% of colonies incorporating mutations in the lacZ allele in each cycle. Although                     our ARF was lower than                     reported [1], we considered it sufficient to screen for fadR mutants.
MAGE fadR KO screening:
Figure 14 | Agarose gel electrophoresis of FadR KO screening                         through allele specific                         PCR, after five MAGE cycles. Numbers correspond to screened colonies. 36                     colonies were analyzed, only                     12 of them are shown in the picture. Top wells correspond to colonies screened with                     wt specific primers.                     Bottom line shows 12 same colonies amplified with specific primers for the FadR                     mutations. Colony 11 shows                     no amplification for the wt allele (361bp), but has the expected amplicon for FadR                     knock-outs; 362bp.
After performing five cycles in EcM2.1 MAGE strain using oligos coding for two stop                     codons in the                     beginning of FadR ORF, We performed allele specific PCR screening. One primer pair                     was designed to                     specifically recognize the WT sequence, while another primer pair was designed to                     anneal to the mutant                     sequence. Performing a colony PCR with both primer pairs should lead to a single                     amplicon, depending on the                     genotype of the analysed colony, as seen in figure 14. All colonies are amplified                     with the WT allele except                     colony number 11, in which amplification with the mutant primer pair appears. This                     colony was selected as                     the bona fide mutant of the FadR repressor. A total of 36 colonies were analyzed                     (only 12 of them shown,                     all other 24 where WT specific). From this we can make a rough estimation of the                     efficiency of FadR KO                     oligo incorporation, which is 2,77%.
fadR optimized screening method:
One of our final composite and biosensor parts; BBa_K2581006 is regulated by FadR                     repressor, which binds                     to pfadBA in the absence of LCFA. We hypothesized that FadR KO cells transformed                     with this construct should                     have basal expression of RFP. Different red intensities can be seen in EcM2.1                     transformed colonies (Figure 15). We                     speculate that this might be due to the fact that EcM2.1 are not optimal for                     protein expression since they                     lack MutS machinery and thus have impaired growth. Red colonies were picked and                     analysed by allele specific                     PCR. Of 16 analysed colonies, 4 included the mutation (Figure 15) which corresponds                     to ~25%. Although this                     screening method does not bypass the need for allele specific PCR screening, it                     significantly increased the                     number of positive colonies in our screening, which would allow for a reduced                     number of cycles when                     obtaining a FadR KO. Finally, we cultured and re-plated a FadR KO colony (num 9                     figure. 16) expressing our                     BBa_K2581006 construct and a fadR negative colony( num. 10 Figure 16). As expected,                     WT colony had a low basal                     level of RFP expression and fadRKO colonies had much higher RFP expression (Figure                     17)

Top gel lanes correspond to colony screening with WT                     specific FadR primers. 4 of                     the 16 tested colonies show amplification for the wt allele. The bottom lanes of                     the gel show colony                     screening using FadR KO primers. Four colonies (8,9,12,13) tested positive for FadR                     KO induced by MAGE.

Discussion of                     Integration results
We generated a strain missing the fadR using MAGE technology,  thus creating a system of overexpression of all the proteins involved in LCFA beta-oxidation, which can be implemented in a biotherapeutic strain. During our screening of mutant colonies, we used the PfadBA biosensor as a way to improve  detection of colonies missing fadR expression. Levels of uptake capabilities between overexpression achieved through synthetic constructs and overexpression by the absence fadR  remains to be characterized.
