Cupric Acetate Fatty Acid Quantification
Quantifying fatty acids in the medium is a key part of our project. In order to prove the functionality of           our genetic constructs, we needed a way to demonstrate that our system had an increased fatty acid uptake           over time. To assess this, indirectly measured the fatty acid concentration that remained in the medium after           during the assay.
Different systems have been previously used to quantify long chain fatty acid in the medium. Including           chemical or thermodynamic titration as well as other enzymatic methods, such as the introduction of Acyl-CoA           synthetase that leads to NADH consumption and it can be detected by fluorimetry. Other options such as HPLC           or GC/MS are also widely used in the scientific community. However due to funding limitations, it was not           doable to use them in our project.
Taking into account a variety of possibilities, we finally chose a method based in the measurement of           metal-fatty acid complexes: the cupric acetate-pyridine method. It is a colorimetric technique based           in a two-phase system and the following binding of free fatty acids to copper forming copper soaps. These           copper soaps can be detected and quantified with spectrophotometric techniques (OD 715 nm). This method           constitutes a simple and rapid method for determination of free fatty acids and it has proof good sensitivity           and reproducibility for caproic, caprylic, capric, lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic and oleic acids [1].           Hence, measuring the OD 715nm for a standard curve and for the different concentrations of the fatty acid           have been developed, the OD can be directly correlated to Â the concentration of free fatty acid.
In order to obtain the optimal medium to work with, an assay was performed to determine a standard curve           with different palmitic acid and oleic acid concentrations and working with media with an emulsion of the           corresponding fatty acid achieved by two methods: (a) diluting using bovine serum albumin (BSA) method or (b)           diluting by using Tergitol NP-40, a detergent. The following were the used media for the assay:
PA diluted with BSA.
PA diluted with tergitol NP-40.
Oleic acid diluted with BSA.
Oleic acid diluted with tergitol NP-40.
