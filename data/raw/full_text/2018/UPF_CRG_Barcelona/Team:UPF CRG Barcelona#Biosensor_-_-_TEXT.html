LONG CHAIN FATTY ACID INTRACELLULAR BIOSENSOR
The main goals of our genetically modified organism are enhancing long chain fatty acids (LCFA) absorption                   and metabolism and. This is doable by overexpressing Fad genes. However, this results in a metabolic burden                   that affects the fitness of the cells, compromising the functionality of our probiotic, specially if it has                   to compete with the rest of the microbiome for resources [1, 2]. For this reason, a system in which this                   overexpression can be switched on and off depending on intracellular concentration of LCFA would be the best                   approach for the designed proof of concept.
We have developed a genetic LCFA sensor device. This system not only allows a reliable characterization of                   the fatty acid (FA) absorption of any bacterial system but can also be used to have a LCFA inducible                   expression system.
The starting point of our design has been the pFadBA promoter. This is the promoter of the fadB and fadA                   genes, and contains FadR binding sequences [3]. Thus, it is a biosensor of LCFA in the cytoplasm, as it is                   derepressed in the presence of LCFA. Other iGEM teams have previously attempted to use it as a LCFA sensor,                   such as NTU_Taida 2014 [4]. However, their results showed a very high baseline expression of the reporter                   proteins coupled to the promoter. This did not allow them to see a significant rise in the signal after                   induction with LCFA.
In order to lower baseline expression, NTU_Taida 2014 team overexpressed FadR, forcing the repression of the                   promoter. However, this approach would impair the functionality of the fad genes, as they are downregulated                   by FadR.
As this interference with LCFA uptake was not compatible with our goal, we aimed to design a biosensor that                   did not compromise bacteria fatty acid metabolism. In order to assess this goal by modulating the activation                   threshold and diminishing the baseline expression, we have followed four different approaches:
Using different RBS
Ribosome binding sites (RBSs) are effective control elements for translation initiation. In fact, they are                   commonly mutated to optimize genetic circuits and metabolic pathways [5]. In cases where the promoter has                   leakage, the use of a weak RBS can help to reduce the signal. This approach does not directly tune the                   promoter activity but the output of our biosensor. We therefore coupled the pFadAB promoter with different                   RBS to see its contribution in each case.
Inducible LuxR-pLux engineered device
In order to accurately quantify LCFA uptake with a genetic reporter, it is needed to obtain a significant                   signal rise after induction with LCFA. Nevertheless, the fold change of the pfadBA promoter after induction                   is very low and does not allow a reliable quantification. We designed a system that allowed us to externally                   modulate genetic expression ( See More )                   in an attempt to create an accurate LCFA biosensor.                   We coupled the pfadBA promoter to the LuxR/pluxR lactone inducible system [6]. This circuit consists of the                   LuxR, acyl-homoserine lactone receptor, under the expression of the pfadAB promoter, coupled with the lux                   promoter expressing a reporter. Lux promoter is activated through luxR-lactone heterodimers.
The use of a second inducer, such as lactone, makes possible to modulate the signal in different ways: (A)                   It enables both to increase the signal and (B) modify the fold change expression of the reporter (with the                   appropriate lactone concentration)
Optimizing the dynamic range of the promoter
As already explained, pFadBA is a sensor with excessive leakage and a poor dynamic range. However, Zhang et                   al. 2012 described a synthetic promoter with a higher dynamic range (pAR), which we have characterized for                   the first time to avoid these levels of basality [7]. In short, this promoter contains an additional FadR                   binding sequence than the natural one. In order to evaluate the responses of this promoter, we builded a                   circuit with pAR and different RBS coupled to fluorescent reporter (BBa_E1010).
FURTHER APPROACHES: High pass filter
In order to eliminate the baseline expression of our reporter systems, we designed a genetic construct that                   would only activate gene expression under the presence of LCFA. Our system consists of an incoherent                   feed-forward loop which creates a high-pass filter.
Through an incoherent feed-forward loop, we could build a biological high-pass filter. This structure is                   widely used in the treatment of electrical and radiofrequency signals, since only those signals with higher                   frequency will pass. In our case, the highpass filter eliminates weak signals (leakage) by passing only the                   strong ones; in other words, signals produced from higher LCFA concentrations.
To understand the effect of a high pass filter we must consider two cases:
Low activity of CI:                      If CI is almost not expressed, it can not fully repress 343_CI and neither activate enough prm. So the                      constitutively repression of 343_CI over prm will not allow a signal output.
High activity of CI:                      If CI is strongly expressed, it can fully repress 343_CI and fully activate prm. Without the 343_CI                      repressing nor CI activating, prm would be able to spread the signal.
FURTHER APPROACHES: The metabolic switch
The capacity to induce or repress a gene depending on the presence of FA can not only be applied within                   the overexpression approach. This could be oriented to change bacteria preference between glucose and LCFA.                   To do so, we have worked with in silico E. coli metabolic models ( see more ). We have found 5 knockouts (KO) that theoretically maintain the growth that a wild type                   has in presence of glucose and palmitic acid. As mentioned in the Metabolic Switch Model .The fact is that with only one KO more, the PA uptake multiplies for three with a little decrease of the growth.
If we make this sixth gene expression dependent of our                   biosensor, we can force our bacteria to absorb more PA than glucose in a rich LCFA medium. In this                   manner, we can maintain our bacteria in absence of PA acid more time in the gut.
Finally, if we mix the overexpression and the metabolic switch biosensor, we would make our bacteria                   uptake even more palmitic acid during a longer period.
