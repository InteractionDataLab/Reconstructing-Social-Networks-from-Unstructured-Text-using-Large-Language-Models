          acid intracellular promoter pFadBA (BBa_k817002). This new promoter has two binding sites for FadR in
          comparison with the existing part. Therefore, we have demonstrate an enhanced function of this promoter
          resulting in a disminution of basility and hence, an improvement of this part. This biobrick consists in the
          assembly of a double terminator which allows forward and reverse terminator (BBa_B0014), and the improved
          promoter based on the previous pFadBA DNA sequence.

          consisting in a high pass filter in order to reduce the high basal activity of the promoter in another
