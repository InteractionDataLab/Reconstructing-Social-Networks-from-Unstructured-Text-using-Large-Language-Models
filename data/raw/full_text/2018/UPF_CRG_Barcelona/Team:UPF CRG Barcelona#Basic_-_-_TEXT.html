BASIC PARTS
BBa_K2581014: FadE gene
The UPF_CRG_Barcelona iGEM team 2018 has synthesized this part as a result of a pcr amplification from the           DH5-alpha E. coli strain. It consists of the coding sequence of the acyl-coA dehydrogenase (FadE) gene           which converts acyl-coA into enoyl-coA. This part is a twin of the BBa_K861020).
BBa_K2581015: FadL gene
The UPF_CRG_Barcelona iGEM team 2018 has synthesized this part as a result of a pcr amplification from the           DH5-alpha E. coli strain. It consists of the coding sequence of the transmembrane protein FadL. This           gene has an essential role in the fatty acid transportation across the cell membrane via a transportation.
Bba_K2581016: FadD gene
The UPF_CRG_Barcelona iGEM team 2018 has synthesized this part as a result of a pcr amplification from the           DH5-alpha E. coli strain. It consists of the coding sequence of the acyl-coA synthetase gene FadD.           This gene has an essential role in the fatty acid transportation inside the cell and in acyl-activation           mechanism.
BBa_K2581020: Modified fatty acyl-CoA responsive promoter
The UPF_CRG_Barcelona iGEM team 2018 has create this part as an improved element from the existing fatty           acid intracellular promoter pFadBA (BBa_K817002). This new promoter has two binding sites for FadR in           comparison with the existing part.
