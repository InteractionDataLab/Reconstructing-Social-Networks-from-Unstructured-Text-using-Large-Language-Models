INTERLAB
Introduction
The aim of the Interlab Study is to develop a reliable and repeatable measurement based on cell number,           fluorescence, absorbance (optical density) and colony formation units (CFUs). Each year, iGEM teams           collaborate in measuring these parameters following the same protocol to obtain a way to have accurate and           reliable measurements, which are essential for all sciences, including synthetic biology.
The main part of the Interlab has been always the green fluorescent protein (GFP), one of the biological           markers most used in synthetic biology.
The goal of the fifth edition of Interlab is to discover the sources of variability in measurements and be           able to correct them, so the measurements taken in different labs will not be variable anymore.
This year question is: Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing             to absolute cell count or CFUs instead of OD?
Materials and Methods
Before the starting the experimental part, a plate reader was needed. Due to the lack of plate reader in our           laboratory, it was kindly asked to Proteomics and Protein Chemistry Unit (DCEXS-UPF, PRBB) to use their           equipment. The plate reader is the Synergy HTX Multimode Reader from Biotek, it can measure both absorbance           and fluorescence. It has pathlength correction, which was not disconnected. It has control over temperature           and it was set as room temperature (around 24-25ºC). The excitation filter was 485/20 nm and           the emission filter 528/20 nm and bottom optics were used. Moreover, the plates were black and flat-bottomed.
Eight plasmids needed to be characterized in DH5-alpha E.coli strain in order to follow the protocol. The           strain was obtained by collaboration with BIO-IQS             iGEM team . The           plasmids are the following: BBa_R0040 , BBa_R0040 , BBa_I20270 , BBa_J3604000 , BBA_J364001 , BBa_J364002 , BBa_J364007 , BBa_J364008 , BBa_J364009 .
The materials used over the protocol are the same ones specified in the iGEM 2018 Interlab               Study               Protocol.
