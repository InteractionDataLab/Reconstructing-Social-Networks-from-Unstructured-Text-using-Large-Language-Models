GRAPHIC DESIGN
Even though iGEM is a competition based in Synthetic Biology, more disciplines come up along the development           of the project. One of these disciplines is Graphic Design.
Graphic design is the key for sharing and communicating everything, from science to politics. Our project           has an important part of visual items to achieve the understanding of our idea.
We have worked to have a visual project for everyone to understand and to improve our communication with the           general and science-specific public
Our logo
When we first started, we had no idea how to design anything. So all the iGEM season has taught us more than           Synthetic Biology. As it is stated in Attributions , Anna Cuesta from           Factoria+ in Universitat Pompeu Fabra, designed some logos for our team.
Logo variations
The final logo comprises the original iGEM logo but with changes as there is a Palmitic Acid molecule in the           end and there are other "small bacteria" inside the bacteria in the logo. By this we wanted to represent our           idea of the proof of concept of a probiotic.
