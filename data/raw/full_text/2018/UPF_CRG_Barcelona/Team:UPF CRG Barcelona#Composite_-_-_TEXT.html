BBa_K2581004: Fatty acid acyl-CoA biosensor with weak RBS
The UPF_CRG_Barcelona iGEM team 2018 has created this part as an intracellular biosensor of fatty acid           uptake. It consists of the assembly of a double terminator which allows forward and reverse terminator           (BBa_B0014), a fatty acyl-CoA responsive promoter which expresses the downstream gene in the presence of           fatty acids (BBa_k817002), a weak RBS (BBa_B0032) and a reporter gene, an engineered mutant of red           fluorescent protein from Discosoma striata (BBa_E1010).
