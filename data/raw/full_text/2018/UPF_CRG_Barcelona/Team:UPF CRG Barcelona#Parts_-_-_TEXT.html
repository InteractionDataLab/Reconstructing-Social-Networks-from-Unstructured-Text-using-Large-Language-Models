PARTS
Basic Parts
These are discrete functional units of DNA, such as promoters or RBSs. They cannot be subdivided in               smaller component parts. We obtained these parts by primer extension and PCR or by synthesis de novo.
Construction intermediate
In order to obtain the final biobrick, it has been necessary to construct intermediate gene pieces.               They can be used for other future constructions and allow the combination between parts.
Composite Parts
We have created several functional units made from the combination of other basic parts in order to               make               our project possible.
Improved Parts
There are the parts that have an improved sequence that results in a better performance and               characterization.
Parts Registry
Here there is the collections of parts that we submitted.
