We performed a systems analysis by defining the differential equations that predict the behaviour of our genetic constructs. We have fitted the parameters to our experimental data so as to demonstrate that is possible to predict gene expression under different LCFA concentrations.
On the other hand, our team believes that it is very important to consider the environment our genetically modified bacteria will grow in. Thus, the metabolic network underlying our system has been carefully studied. Flux balance analysis has been used in order to predict the behaviour of our modified bacteria under the intestine conditions where it will grow.
