Carla Castignani
BSc in Human Biology and MSc in Bioinformatics
I am interested in genomes, botany and bacteria. Three things I‚Äôm obsessed about recently: bees,                     climate                     change and obstacle races. I am a ‚Äúhandywoman‚Äù, the one that can build anything out of anything.                     During my                     free time I like to watch films, go to art exhibitions and to sew. But who are we kidding, no one                     in iGEM                     really has free time.

Dimitrije Ivanƒçiƒá
BSc in Human Biology and MSc of Multidisciplinary Research in Experimental                     Sciences
I play records, climb mountains and edit genomes. I believe directed evolution is a powerful tool                     for                     biological design. When I grow up I would like to work at the Tyrell Corporation.
Which is your dreamed GMO?
Bacteria that can sing. I bet that they would have a preference for jazz.
Guillem Lopez-Grado
BSc in Human Biology
I am somewhat of a single-cell wetlab being, trying to get into computational approaches, going                     back to the                     first real (kind of) steps I took in science. I try to always move forward and try new things, such                     as                     getting into photography, or global movements. I devote my non-lab time to rugby, Lightroom and the                     outdoors.
Which is your dreamed GMO?
The way things are going in our world, it has to be plastic-degrading bacteria.

Jordi Pla
BSc in Biomedical Engineering
I am interested on mathematical modelling of biological processes and emergence theory. Most of the                     time I am automating useless processes or transforming ideas and caffeine into algorithms and                     sarcasm. I hope to finish this project without creating a Dalek by mistake.
Which is your dreamed GMO?
An ex novo engineered organism.

√ìscar Rodr√≠guez
BSc in Biomedical Engineering
The concept of a Biomedical Engineer defines me very well. I am interested in many fields, but my                     passion is to apply mathematical models in the field of biology and neuroscience. I am a very                     active person, so I firmly believe that sleeping is greatly overrated. I prefer to spend my time                     reading, enjoying with friends or simply wandering in superfluous thoughts.
Which is your dreamed GMO?
An organism against baldness.

Laura Sans
BSc in Human Biology
I am interested in bioinformatics, structural biology and proteomics, you should see how cool it is                     to play with proteins and sequences. I'm a doer, from writing algorithms to watching Netflix all                     night. When I'm not in the lab I like to do things such as travel, design stuff, play with my dogs                     or go to the lab. I always carry a camera with me.
Which is your dreamed GMO?
A Nutella-producer bacteria.

Oriol Sol√†
BSc in Human Biology and BSc in Mathematics
I like to study biology from a more theoretical point of view. I am really interested in systems                     biology and math modelling. I am a non-conformist always willing to learn and discover new things.                     In my free time I like to sneak out the city to explore nature, I am addicted to extreme sports.
Which is your dreamed GMO?
An electrical charger plant.

Marta Vilademunt
BSc in Human Biology
I am deeply interested in Neuroscience as I found fascinating the understanding of the brain. I am                     a very active person, who loves planning and having always a busy schedule. The few moments I have                     time for myself I love spending it cooking, reading, travelling, sporting and being surrounded by                     nature.
Which is your dreamed GMO?
A neuro-bacteria able to diminish stress.

Eva Gonz√°lez
Phd in Synthetic Biology for Biomedical Applications
I am a Biomedical Engineer with a master‚Äôs in biomedical research pursuing a PhD. My thesis aims to                     combine Synthetic Biology and engineering approaches for biomedical applications. My daily routine                     consists on designing genetic circuits, analyzing them with mathematical models and building them                     in bacterial cells.

Avencia Sanchez-Mej√≠as
Senior Scientist in Translational Synthetic Biology Lab
I did my PhD in human genetics and I have worked in understanding the molecular hallmarks of cancer                     regulation during two postdoctoral fellowships in USA and Singapore. Currently, I am a senior                     scientist at Dr. G√ºell‚Äôs lab. I am working in the development of new gene editing and gene delivery                     strategies for therapeutical purposes, contributing to the implementation of advanced synthetic                     biology tools for treating human diseases.

Sergi Aranda
Senior Scientist in Epigenetic Events on Cancer
My scientific aim, to unravel the molecular mechanisms that establish and sustain cellular                     memories. On the way, my research focuses on understanding the biological rules that dictate cell                     fate in mammalian development and human disease. The goal, to engineer toolboxes for the control of                     cell states and fate commitment. How do I do? Working together with a fantastic group of people at                     the Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona as Staff Scientist.

Marc G√ºell
PI of Translational Synthetic Biology Lab
I am a tenure track professor at Pompeu Fabra University. My laboratory is focused in leveraging                     new gene editing technologies for therapeutic purposes. Our two main lines of research are                     mammalian genome engineering and microbiome engineering.
