About Team
UPF_CRG_Barcelona team is impulsed by Experimental and Health Sciences Department and Information and           Communication Tecnologies Department at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) and by Centre for Genomic Regulation           (CRG), a biomedical and genomics research center based in Barcelona. Both institutions wager for the           education and enterpreneurship of young minds and for this reason they encouraged UPF science students to           take part in the iGEM competition. They gave us this challenging oportunity to create our own science project            from scratch.
