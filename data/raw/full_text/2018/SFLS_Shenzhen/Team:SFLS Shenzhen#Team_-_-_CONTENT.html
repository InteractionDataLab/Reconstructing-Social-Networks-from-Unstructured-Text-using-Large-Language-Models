I still remember how excited I was when first stepped into the lab. I’ve always been a curious and creative girl who is interested in science, and that’s why I became an iGEMer. As a team leader, I communicate with every team member and direct their work. I also design the project and do experiments.
My hobbies are listening to music and playing video games. My favorite music type is rock music (sometimes I think I’m more like a boy). I also like animals a lot, so I kept many pets.
Though exhausting, I never regret joining iGEM. I enjoy designing our own project and working with other students because I am creating my dream.
</P><H3>Zhaoting Li</H3><H5>16yo</H5><H5>Experiment and Design</H5><P>
As a member from the team SFLS_Shenzhen, my main job is desiging our project and managing experiments. The fact that I'm a high school student makes iGEM a bit hard for me at the beginning, but it’s still a lot of fun and I really enjoy the process of competing.  My dream is to study Maths and Economics, maybe also Computer Science. it will be my first time to travel abroad this October and since I like traveling a lot, I’m looking forward to the chance of visiting a foreign city and have a nice Jamboree. 
</P><H3>Bella Pei</H3><H5>16yo</H5><H5>Experiment and Design</H5><P>
I am Bella from SFLS and I am a junior. I am currently trying to make my life fulfilled besides studying. I am outgoing but shy.  It’s like a paradox but…you know (Meredith editing this: ??? No I don’t) Joining iGEM is a perfect “mistake”. I love biology from the documentaries of BBC and I find it way more different in iGEM than I expected.  As an art student, I find it hard for me to understand those codes and numerous gene sections.  But doing HP is fun :D
</P><H3>Phoebe Zhang</H3><H5>16yo</H5><H5>Experiment and Design</H5><P>
My name is Phoebe Zhang, and I come from Shenzhen Foreign Languages School.   As high school students, our team’s members have devoted our spare time to preparing for the competition.  Although I am not the one who owns the best knowledge in our team, I always hold the love towards Biology and Chemistry.  IGEM strengthen my curiosity in those subjects.  Every steps that getting closer to new things about biology let me become more and more insisted in becoming a doctor in the future.  I hope that everyone member in IGEM can find his own place and learns a lot. 
</P><H3>Jingting Qu</H3><H5>16yo</H5><H5>Experiment and Design</H5><P>
My name is Jingting Qu. I am an high school student in SFLS. I am interested in science and Biology,and I am curious to explore something in my daily life. For me, iGEM is a good chance to learn and improve myself. I have also met many good friends!! They helped me a lot. I worked on designing the project and doing the experiments in SFLS_SHENZHEN. I enjoy every minute in the lab. And in my free time, I like reading novels, watching movies and contacting with friends. Those make me feel relaxed. Although this is my first time in iGEM, I love it. 
</P><H3>Leyi yang</H3><H5>16yo</H5><H5>Experiment and Design</H5><P>
I’m a senior high school student from Shenzhen, China. When I am a junior high school student, I was very interested in biology and would like to become a biologist when I grow up. So when I heard that there is a very interesting biology competition, I decided to attend the competition without hesitation. Now,  I am a team member in ShenzhenSFLS, and I learn a lot in the team. It’s a great competition that can improve you a lot, and I lay the foundation of my biological career。I am grateful to the competition.

My name is Echo. I am a big fan of biology and engineering, so I came to iGEM. I enjoy reading, cutting aluminum tubes and day-dreaming. Those habits truly helped me become a wise girl. I'd never thought I would be in our school's iGEM team. It feels fantastic to produce something by my own hands. What's more fantastic is that the product can even help other people!  I'm glad that I made the right decision.

I have been enamored with biology since an early age.  Working in iGEM provided me with bunch of information to get closer to the truth of human.  When I am doing experiments, every moment is divine.  Watching the billions of disordered DNA finally twist together and became double helix, I thought I probe the origin of human.  I indulged in the gene’s ocean, feeling each of my fibers flow, my organs associate and work without the command of my brain, my ego tracks back to my deepest mind.  Adding enzymes and cutting DNA series, I manipulate the phenotypic trait in the Garden of Eden.  From a single oosperm to a living thing with thoughts and numerous ability, the progress of human enchanted me and showed me my way to a biologist. I like playing basketball, painting, listening to music, and sleeping.
