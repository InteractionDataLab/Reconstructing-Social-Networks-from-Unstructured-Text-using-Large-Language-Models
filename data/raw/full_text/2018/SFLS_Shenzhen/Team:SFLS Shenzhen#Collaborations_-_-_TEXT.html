The Erusian Meetup
On July the 24th, 25th and 26th, we attended the Erusian meetup hosted by TU Delft and BGI college iGEM teams. This was a great opportunity for us to present our project to others. We delivered a formal presentation, and explained our project at poster sessions. We were also able to find out more about other teams’ projects and their work.
We were able to set up links with some of the teams there which led to some of our collaborations. In addition, it was useful to talk to other teams with more experience and get advice on things like poster design or presentation skills.
