Background
Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy in the world. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the number of new cases of breast cancer in the world reached 1.38 million in 2008, and that is 22.9% of all female malignancies; 460,000 women died of breast cancer, which is 13.7% of all female malignant tumor deaths, and 1.7% of all female deaths [1] According to statistics, the annual incidence of female breast cancer in China is 169,000, which is the second most common malignant tumor in women; the death of female breast cancer in China is about 45,000; it is the sixth most common cause of malignant tumor death in women [2] The occurrence and development of breast cancer involves many factors, and the change of gene level expression is the most important regulatory factor [3]. In recent years, breast cancer has become a growing threat to people, and many well-known celebrities have died of breast cancer, which has also aggravated people’s panic about this type of cancer.
Beina Yao, a Chinese pop singer, was born in Wuhan, Hubei, in September 26, 1981. At 16:55 January 16, 2015, Yao died due to relapsed of breast cancer in Peking University of Shenzhen Hospital, and she was only 33 years old. This incident caused great sensation in China.
miR-155 and miR-10b are two miRNAs that have high expression in human serum when a person has developed early forms of breast cancer in their tissues.Based on the high expression level in breast cancer patients’ serum and the high specificity, miRNA-155 and miRNA-10b will act as biomarkers (the alarm of breast cancer)in our project
What we are doing
 Our project is to use miRNA——miRNA155 and miRNA10b——in human serum as biomarkers to detect early forms of breast cancer.Based on the high expression level in breast cancer patients’ serum and the high specificity,miRNA-155 and miRNA-10b will act as biomarkers (the alarm of breast cancer)in our project while Toehold switches are used for the detection of miRNA.We designed an AND gate to detect both types of miRNAs at the same time.When both types of miRNAs express at a high level,our artificial biosystem will produce GFP.   The greater amount RNA express, the higher its fluorescence density is. We can use mathematics  modal to calculate the expression level through the   fluorescence intensity, thus enables the early diagnosis of the breast cancer by using serum albumin.
