Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting
The FACS machine was used to measure fluorescence data of the cells at various time points. There were three solutions of cells and we measured the fluorescence for all three solutions at each of the time points. The time points were separated by 20 minute intervals, where the first time point was zero. During the 20 minute intervals for a total of two and a half hours, the cells were grown in the shaking incubator. At each interval, we measured the fluorescence of a sample of the cells and also froze a sample in glycerol. We later ran FACS on the cells that were frozen and it was found that the fluorescence was still about the same for each respective time interval.
