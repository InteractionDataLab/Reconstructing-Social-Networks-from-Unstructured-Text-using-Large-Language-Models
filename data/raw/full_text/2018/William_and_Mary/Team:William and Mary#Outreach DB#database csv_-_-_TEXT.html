Besides giving an outline of the iGEM project, discuss two findings that were encountered many times over during research for Synenergene: the problem of low oil prices and inconsistent government policy
Argue that low oil prices prohibit the full transition to a bio-based economy, and that biotechnology in and of itself is unlikely to ever match the costs of pumping oil out of the ground in terms of cost-effectiveness unless the peripheral costs of burning fossil fuels are properly taken into account
In a room full of policy makers, bring up the issue of inconsistent government policy pertaining to how the Dutch government has the tendency to change policy regarding biotech subsidization and legislation every two years

Meet with stakeholders; IVIA (Valencian Institute of Agrarian Researches), Intersemillas (national seedbed company), and Babyplant (local seedbed company) to gain feedback about whether ""HYPE-IT"" would be a useful tool, and to gain information about how to focus the project for maximal usefulness
",Integrated Human Practices,"IVIA was impressed by the CRISPR/Cas9 plant breeding technique, and noted that they used transgenics for research purposes, but not for developing new varieties, though that would change if the EU approved CRISPR/Cas9 edited plants for consumption. Intersemillas noted that the key part of the project was the data processing tool and database, and that resistance to plagues and disease is the most relevant improvement for plants.

Of the techniques surveyed, hybridization and artificial selection were the most widely known, while polyploidy and induced mutagenesis where the least. Of those surveyed 33.9% believed that induced mutagenesis is a commonly used technique. When asked ""which plant breeding technique they think is the best and the worse from a nutritional, health and economical point of view?"" 44.3% of those surveyed chose artificial selection as the best technique and 23.5% of those surveyed chose genetic editing as the best technique. 68.7% of those surveyed chose induced mutagenesis as the worst technique. 3.5% of those surveyed chose genetic editing as the worst technique.

On the whole, plant genome editing was not seen as unfavorable, and is altogether seen as more favorable than ""transgenics"". Of those surveyed, many knew about transgenics, but only about half knew the difference between transgenics and genome editing.

From their experience we found that chips cost much more in the early development, but its cost diminishes quickly in later stages when mass production is reached, ranging from $0.1 to few dollars. However, there exist a conflict of material. In the iGEM version we picked optical cement instead of PMDS for its advantages of adequate solidification speed, feasibility, bio-inertia, and precision of altitude. However, PMDS production industries are much more matured. There is currently no companies offering mass production of optical cement microfluidic chips.

Create a ""threshold question"" to separate respondents who know about cancer immunotherapy from those who do not. Those who do not will not continue with the questionnaire, while those who do will answer more questions. 2) Share the questionnaire online (such as through SO JUMP and WeChat) to gather the greatest sample size. 3) Compile results, often as fractions (ex: 1/20 participants agreed that ______) to interpret public knowledge level and attitudes. 4) Create another questionnaire, this time for medical experts, also gauging knowledge, attitude, and attention. 5) Print the surveys and distribute to doctors at a hospital. 6) Again compile results, often as fractions. 7) Discuss results, this time accounting for limiting factors of the questionnaire, background information, and possible explanations for the results. As well, viewpoint plays a role here--Fudan used survey results to support their viewpoint that cancer immunotherapy is a ""naive"" therapy and thus warrants more research. This viewpoint led them to complete their 2017 project, called SwordS.</ul>",Integrated Human Practices,"53 of the doctors surveyed chose the “know well” answer about the concept of cancer immunotherapy. However, when asked about their knowledge of more specific cancer immunotherapy concepts, the proportion of “smatter”, “only hear of” or “blind” answers increased. Furthermore, doctors have a somewhat prudent attitude towards immunotherapy. Among all of 74 replies, only twelve of doctors agreed on “immunotherapy has strong specificity”, eight agreed on “immunotherapy has a slight side effect”, six agreed on “immunotherapy has a good effect”. The majority hold a neutral or even negative opinion. In contrast, the public showed a rather positive attitude towards immunotherapy. 74 out of 126 stayed neutral, only 3 showed an obvious rejection, while 49 were for this new therapy. Unfortunately, the public sample had a rather low frequency about knowing the information about cancer immunotherapy. 44 out of 124 had learned related information in the last month, while 62 had learned in the last half year.","74 medical professionals surveyed, 191 public surveys completed","Doctors generally have a negative attitude toward immunotherapy. In part, this shows that immunotherapy requires more research and clinical trials; real technological advances are key to the development of therapies. This belief led Fudan iGEM to work on SwordS, their 2017 project. Furthermore, though the frequency of doctors' knowledge is satisfactory, it can still be strengthened.

Anticipate This involves continuous consideration of how you want the innovation you are designing and introducing into society to shape the future of society. It's important to question in what ways you want your research to change the future and pay close attention to the associated risk and implications for society and the environment.   It was important to gain information from stakeholders to help our understanding of the specific impacts of our project and then have internal meetings to discuss how we can act upon these. It also served a useful starting point for reflection. For example, interacting with Greenpeace allowed us to anticipate the issues surrounding the use of GM organisms in the field and the need for secure containment of any such organisms. We therefore began looking into methods for biosecurity. Click here for further information
Reflect
Reflection is about considering the motivations behind a project to ensure the purpose of the research is fully understood. It involves thinking about the evolution of the project and most importantly ensuring that the research, and innovation, is still in line with the societal issue you want it to solve.
Meetings with stakeholders often stimulated reflection, such as our meeting with a representative from Plymouth Marine Laboratory which allowed us to reflect on some of our initial ideas for our filtration system and refine them accordingly (Click here for further information). However, we generally found reflection was an internal process that allowed us to make educated decisions and allowed us to consider the broader questions surrounding our project. It also made it easier to identify the relevant stakeholders.
Engage
This part of the framework is about identifying and communicating with stakeholders who have expertise in the areas required to influence your research. A wide range of stakeholders and members of the general public should be involved to get a full range of perspectives.
We found it important to find out as much as we could around our chosen research area before identifying the stakeholders who would be able to provide us with the knowledge we required. Maintaining a dialogue with stakeholders to ensure we continually engaged with them to utilise their expertise to help shape our project.
Visiting the Veolia water treatment plant allowed us to engage with directly with the current stakeholders involved with tackling metal ion pollution from the Wheal Jane site. Click here for further information
Act
To act is to take on board advice from stakeholders and actively use this information to influence and make changes to the project. It's important for researchers to remain flexible in their response, considering all views before change the trajectory of the project
Throughout our project our decisions were highly influenced by direction gained from both academics and stakeholders.

With Mantis, we do not test for antibodies, which might influence the reliability of the test. Furthermore, they thought that bacteria are not always robust enough, and felt like a cell-free system could be of interest for us. They suggested that we look into patents and patenting our new diagnostic test.
► We looked at patents by talking to ir. Paul van Helvert (Intellectual Property manager of Wageningen University & Research). After this conversation we decided that patenting our device would not be feasible at this point due to costs and the open-source mindset of the iGEM competition. Also, we looked into the robustness of a whole-cell biosensor compared to cell-free systems. More can be read in the roll-out plan.

Although she switched jobs soon after we met her, she remained willing to advise us on ethics-related questions about our project and about the iGEM Jamboree. She endorsed our plans for biosafety: an infographic and interviews. She advised us to define the target of our application more precisely. Another point she mentioned was 'connect the disconnect': find the bottleneck in the whole diagnosis process and try to connect it using our project. She also advised us on preventing the feeling of being overwhelmed by the competition: reconsider your approach after every new bit of information. Moreover, to use the expert's point of view to get more specific info on the topic, and to set goals prior to interviewing. Finally, try to show it in a storyline. As a result of this interview our approach to interviewing experts greatly improved.

Sander Koenraadt and dr. Niels Verhulst see the benefit in focusing on both human diagnostic and mosquitoes. In mosquitoes there is no problem with the presence of viruses in the blood or issues with treatment availabilities. However, there is currently not a great need for a new field test for viral diseases in blood fed mosquitoes. It only becomes a necessity after a disease is transmitted from animals to humans.
We talked to dr. Sander Koenraadt, Assistant professor at the Laboratory of Entomology (Wageningen University & Research), expert in medical entomology and vector-borne diseases, about the application of our device on mosquitoes and he referred us to dr. ir. Niels Verhulst. Dr. Niels Verhulst developed an odor compound combination which attracts blood fed mosquitoes. He also developed traps which have already been used in the field.

We learned that education of the local population is very important to gain the trust of the population and prevent miscommunication. Moreover, Jeanine gave lots of information about the local situation in Congo, which we can take into account in our roll-out plan. Furthermore, she confirmed that diagnostics are still important even when treatment options are not available, as they give information about the diseases present in the area and play a major role in preventing epidemics. This means our device is more relevant at large-scale screening than on individual-based testing.
Via the expert talk with dr. Sander Koenraadt, we were referred to her for more inside information. She told us that there are often sudden explosions in the number of infected people, that may be caused by mosquitoes that get resistant against pesticides.
The control of, for example, malaria is challenging because of the political status of Congo: setting up and maintaining a functional health system is very difficult. This was also emphasized earlier during our talk with prof. Joseph Ndung'u. MSF negotiates with both the governmental military and rebel groups. They achieved building a hospital that acts as a base camp to prepare for fieldwork. It attracts the local population that now goes to this hospital instead of local government health centers. This hospital employs both foreign specialists and locals, in which the former educate the latter. The goal is to create an independent health system, run by experienced locals, without the interference of MSF. Furthermore, MSF also has to rely on the help of locals for the delivery of medicine and equipment in case their shipments cannot be delivered to the hospital due to dangerous situations caused by the country’s conflicts.
MSF outreach teams are active in screening for malaria in mosquitoes as well as in the population, but also by educating locals about the work they do. The latter is very important to gain the trust of the population and prevent miscommunications. The current rapid malaria diagnostics give a readout in 15 minutes. If positive, the patient will be taken along to the MSF hospital. Introduction of a new diagnostic in countries such as Congo requires trust by the government, as they always need to give permission. Therefore, it is best to do this via established NGOs such as MSF. On the topic of diagnostics for diseases without a cure or treatment, Jeanine mentioned that these are still very important, as they give information about the diseases present in the area, as well as their role in preventing epidemics",,Met with Jeanine Loonen from Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF),,, 1691,Wageningen_UR,Overgraduate,2017, https://2017.igem.org/Team:Wageningen_UR,Nominated for Best Integrated Human Practices,Integrated Human Practices,"Meeting with Prof. dr.

We also asked them about vector monitoring, regarding our previous decision of not making it our main story.

HAT has been a problem in Africa for many decades. Even though this disease is long known, researchers have still not been able to develop a good diagnostic tool. However, alternatives are available, meaning viral diagnostics have higher priority. As a lot is known about HAT, it is a good example to prove that our device can be used in fighting parasitic diseases. In his opinion, our device should contain a positive control, and an LED-screen for quantitation of the result would be a good addition.
",1 expert,"Dr. Philippe Büscher is an expert on Trypanosomiasis and part of the WHO Collaborating Center for Research and Training on Human African Trypanosomiasis Diagnostics; OIE Reference Laboratory for Surra. He told an in-depth story about the history of HAT in Africa. After the colonizers left Africa, e.g. after the independence of Congo from Belgium, the health system collapsed and Sleeping Sickness re-emerged. This shows that these countries largely rely on western NGOs. To this day, the WHO, other NGOs, and companies are providing free diagnostics and treatment for HAT patients in Congo. This is expensive and costs US$ 100-200 per patient.
Currently mobile teams leave from a central point, after which they travel up to 20 days a month to remote villages on motorbikes or 4x4s. The tests they are carrying is either the Card Agglutination Test, with a high false positive rate, or an antibody dipstick test, without positive control. It is important that our device does not need much equipment, is stable at 40 degrees Celsius and has a positive control.
Moreover, he gave some technical details on the detection limit of current devices, and on HAT protein production. He showed us the current tests and explained how they are exactly performed. Finally, some suggestions for alternative use of our device were made. For example to test antibiotic resistance or to be used in reference laboratories. Here, sensitivity of detection is more important than speed of producing a result.
He endorsed our 3D-printed device prototype and was surprised by the ease of use and to observe the fluorescence. He thought it would be a nice addition to quantify the fluorescent signal and to add an LED-screen. This is in line with the opinions of prof. dr. Wim van de Poel and dr. Jeroen Kortekaas in previous talks. Finally, he suggested to increase the readability of the text on the device, and to indicate the place to insert the controls and the samples.
He mentioned that a lot of research has already been done on HAT and a new diagnostic device is needed but does not have a high priority. However, because of the high research levels, it is an excellent way to prove that our device can be used in combatting parasitic diseases as HAT is a suitable placeholder and proof-of-concept.

Research suggests the most impactful learning from games occur when the educational content is part of the intrinsic challenges of the game, and a successful educational game provides the opportunity for kinetic, strategic, cognitive learning, and prior knowledge application (Boyan & Sherry 2011).
The gameplay was designed for a high school aged audience, to provide a fun introduction to synthetic biology. We also designed an additional function where the player could access an encyclopaedia, targeted for undergraduate university students, where they could learn more advanced concepts, for example restriction enzymes and transformation, in an interactive manner.  Players navigate their E. coli via controlling its flagella to collect nutrients to remain healthy and undergo cell division, thus increasing the swarm. The swarm survives hazards through force of numbers. A single survivor can complete the level, but the player will be rewarded with more nutrients if they can keep a higher number of the swarm alive. The idea of controlling a swarm and the difficulty to keep them all alive, often ending a level with a few or even just one, was designed to reflect low transformation efficiency levels seen commonly in molecular biology experiments.
Throughout the levels players would collect BioBricks, and at the conclusion of the level, enter a mini-game where they would use the collected BioBricks in a drag and drop manner in the correct sequence to undergo transformation. The character would then enter the new level with added functions gained from the BioBricks.  Due to time constraints we were unable to complete and release the game for use before the iGEM Jamboree. However, with the substantial progress we did achieve, we hope to see it implemented in the future.

Ondoa we realized that cell culturing might be a bottleneck when performed in the field. Moreover, in her opinions screening large populations for viral diseases is important for monitoring.
She felt that HAT is not the best example for a new diagnostic device, as the disease has been combated quite successfully already. However, this changed after we explained that we would like to compare our diagnostic to current methods. Since HAT is a long known disease, it is suitable for comparison.
In case of viral diseases where no distinct symptoms are present, the need of the diagnostic changes completely. In this case, it would be of more use for screening the presence and development of a disease in the population and to place positively screened individuals in quarantine. Thus, the focus is on prevention of spread rather than specific treatment of infected individuals. If the device is used in such a way, the effect of vaccination on the spread of disease can also be seen.
Dr. Pascale Ondoa emphasized that we should look more into biosafety. Moreover, we should not forget that research and development costs are high. This needs to be considered when calculating the estimated cost of our diagnostic.

Create a survey with targeted questions about your project.
submit the survey to the public,Quantitative,"MOSQUITO SURVEY
Question 1: do you use mosquito eradication products? Analysis: 81.46% of the respondents use mosquito eradication products, indicates that mosquito eradication products are well accepted by the public and the market is huge.
Question 3: do you pay attention to new innovative mosquito eradication products? Analysis: 16.56% of the respondents always pay attention to new mosquito eradication products and 55.96% of them do it sometimes. These data indicate that new mosquito eradication products, like the product of ours, could be noticed by the public and have the potential to access to market.
Question 8:what do you think are the deficiencies of mosquito control products in the market? Analysis: Due to the results from question 8, inefficiency, inconvenience and less in variety are the three main problems of mosquito control products in the market. Therefore, in order to get the product of ours accepted by the market and public, we have to improve its efficiency and convenience.
Question 10: what’s your attitude towards the advancement of mosquito control technologies in the future? Analysis: 55.3% of the respondents are expecting new and more advanced mosquito control products, which indicates that the product of ours could be accepted by the public as a new measure of mosquito control if it’s advanced enough.
NEXT SURVEY - GMO Survey Question 1: how much do you know about GMO？ Analysis: 79.61% (9.92% + 69.69%) of the respondents know GMO and 20.11% have heard of it, while only 0.28% of the respondents know nothing about GMO. These data indicate that GM technology is known and accepted by most of the respondents.
Question 2: Which one (or more than one) of the followings might be GM products found in the Chinese market? Analysis: This is a test about respondents’ knowledge on GMO. Except for maize, all of the products in the list could be GMO or GM products in China, but the number of volts for maize is the second highest (90.65%), and most people don't believe that cottons, beets, tobaccos, ppapaya and insulin could be GMO or produced by GMO. This suggests that the majority of the respondents are lacking of knowledge about GM technology and GMO.
Question 3: in what way do you think GMO could influence people’s health? Analysis: 44.19% of the respondents believe that GMO is potentially harmful (meanwhile not beneficial at all) to human health, while 30.88% believe that GMO could bring both benefits and harm to human health. Which means the respondents were not fully informed about the truth of GMO, some of them don't know the benefits GMO could bring, and the others cannot hold a certain attitude on it. Therefore, it is our job to inform as much people as possible about the facts about GMO.
Question 8: What’s your attitude toward the researches in the field of transgenosis? Analysis: 74.22% of the respondents support further researches in the field of transgenosis, which means transgenosis and GMO have the potential to be accepted by the majority of the public and the public wants to know more about GMO.",,,,,,, 1826,GZHS-United,High School,2017, https://2017.igem.org/Team:GZHS-United,None,Education and Public Engagement,Leaflet about GMO & Leaflet about Mosquito Control,Just Product,"<a href="" https://2017.igem.org/Team:GZHS-United/HP/Gold_Integrated ""> https://2017.igem.org/Team:GZHS-United/HP/Gold_Integrated </a>","We made two leaflets that were used as educational and popularizational materials, on the two main focuses of our program, GMO and mosquito control",Other,General Public,Educate on the iGEM program,</ul>,Integrated Human Practices,"GMO Leaflet

Players are supposed to control a BioBrick container in their hands to store gene chains and shoot bullets to attack the enemy in front of them. In the meantime players should avoid being shot by bullets from enemies. There are a variety of enemies, whose blood volume, flying speed of bullets, movement patterns and scores are different. In the fifth section, there is a “Final BOSS” which is quite hard to deal with. A tool aiming at supplying blood for players is set in this game. A large number of BioBricks are randomly generated around the player. When the BioBricks are touched by the handle, a system which provides skills to players will start. The system will automatically select a suitable gene chain according to the gene blocks being touched. To start the game and acquire special skills, player must touch the virtual promoter and terminator, respectively. If players touch the wrong gene, the gene chains will be overloaded, which means they are cleared and regenerated. Players are provided with four special skills: explosion (reduce the blood volume of all enemies), blood supplement (return to full-blood status), no-enemy status and shooting speed acceleration. What's more, players will get extra rewards when they find symbols of ""BioDesigner Dolphin"". After players complete the game, their duration time and scores acquired will be ranked on the leaderboard in the main UI interface. What’s more, to make the game more interesting, there is also a rewarding mechanism. A searching “magnifier” is randomly generated in the game, and by touching it, the gene chains will be instantly filled and players can release the current skills.

1.We can find a more suitable microbial chassis instead of E.coli because it might be intolerable to so any heterologous recombinant proteins.
2.How can we recycle Tb3+ from the recycled REEBOTs? Maybe we can extract them (Tb3+) by some chemical solutions, and then purify them by replacement reaction or others.
3.We can optimize the pmrC promoter and triple LBT by modeling and doing some orthogonal experiments.

With the interviews: Q1 - What do you think of the water quality and pollution situation at the present? Water pollution is serious, current water quality is high but there is sewage pollution and the impact of enterprise factories is large.  The Quality is not as good as before.  Not satisfied, some of the scenic spots are good, and to the rural areas, many of the rivers have a small.
Q2 - What do you think about water quality testing methods at present? Water detection methods have been developed to take real-time monitoring of high-tech pipeline...The advantages are high precision and fast data. The disadvantage is the price is too high.  I don't understand that, I think it's the EPA. I've never measured water quality before, but if I have a handy detector, I really want to go.  We usually test ourselves. Take some water samples, buy their own reagents, test the water and compare to tables to determine water body pH value and nitrogen content and oxygen content.
Q3 - If we developed a bioreactor for testing would you like to use it? The advantage of biological detection is it is convenient and inexpensive. We could use it to call the social water monitors, monitor the surrounding waters irregularity, and detect oxygen for aquaculture farmers.  The price right now is too high, but we will certainly consider the use of it.  I would like that, especially if I could install it and not have to change it a lot.  I think i can be used for specific analysis. There are few people who wash things or drink directly from wells or rivers, but if you look at the poor areas without the use of tap water who can only use water in the natural environment then being able to use a detector that is convenient and reasonably priced would be good for the whole country.
Q4 - Do you have any suggestions for our products? I think the most important thing is quality, price and accuracy.  The product needs to be not to expensive to die, I hope precision is as high as possible.

Students took the first step and expressed interest in joining the lab.
iGEM members took the time to train two high school students in the techniques and goals of the iGEM team.
The students worked in the lab over the summer and wrote a brief blurb about their experience. ,Qualitative,"""My name is Agne Cepaite and I am a 10th grade student. I was given an opportunity to engage with the Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM 2017 team's work, to observe, help out and, most importantly, learn. This has been an incredible experience, I had a chance to work in a laboratory and help with the InterLab project, as well as engage in activities of Human Practices. I enjoyed both, however I am very interested in the subject of biological sciences, therefore the laboratory work was probably the most mesmerizing, since I have never worked in a lab before. It was definitely challenging, since my knowledge did not extend as far as I wanted, however with a very accepting and teaching team, I have learned many new things about molecular and synthetic biology.""
""The opportunity of being a trainee at Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team of 2017 opened my eyes to the world of Synthetic Biology. It was a truly outstanding experience mainly due to the vast knowledge and extreme proficiency in their study fields from the whole iGEM team, which I was able to observe and learn from. During discussions about the lab and the fundamentals of the idea I was astonished nearly 100% of the time because of the intense flow of new concepts and ideas. Furthermore, aiding the team in other fields such as HP was very new to me, I was never part of such a big group project and was certainly never appointed to help design scientific activities and even take part in sharing the responsibility of the project. I now see the iGEM competition as something great not just because it helps to form and characterize synthetic biology, but of what it helps others to achieve through hard work, determination and, most importantly, teamwork. I aspire to become competent enough in my field over the course of couple of years and then attempt to give another shot at the iGEM competition, but this time as a proper team member to experience everything first hand.""",2,,,Two highly motivated high school students came into lab to work with the team. ,,,

Tell students about syn bio and project
Ask them what concerns and safety consideration they have about project,Qualitative,"The greatest advantages of synthetic biology they discussed can be summarized into four main categories:
The opportunity to improve food production. For example, increasing yield by resistance introduction, drought-resistant crops, and more sustainable production. Production and development of medicines. Both developments of novel, better and cheaper medicines were mentioned, as well as better diagnostics. General, non-specific improvements in current and new industrial processes; faster, easier, more efficient, and economically favorable. Reduced impact on climate, by using synthetic biology for protection of the environment, protect threatened animal species, and improvement of sustainability. However, there were also some concerns, both personal as well as on how they think the wider public will react on synthetic biology. These can be summarized into three categories:
Safety By mutations or combinations of different genes, hazardous microorganisms can be created or formed, like bioweapons, superorganisms, antibiotic resistant bacteria etc. Fear of possible dangers of the end-product made via a GMO-production process. Lot of uncertainties and misunderstandings about safety of GMO-products. Ethics Ethical issues on modification of organisms and transferring genetic material of one species to another. Religion-related ethical issues: interfering with God’s creations. Hard to set boundaries in genetic modification; are we going to modify people in the future? GMO-products are considered artificial/unnatural. Biocontainment The possible negative effect on an ecosystem and lowering biodiversity when GMOs are introduced in nature. Next, the students were informed about our project; making a modular diagnostic kit against tropical diseases. They were stimulated to think about possible problems this can bring into a community where it is applied. Their opinions can be summarized into:
Availability of treatments. After diagnosis, sufficient medicines should be available to treat the diagnosed people. If treatment is not available, resources are insufficient, or the people cannot afford treatment, a diagnosis will not improve the quality of life for these people. Overpopulation in those areas. Lower mortality rate by good diagnostics can result in overpopulation, and possibly more hunger and unemployment problems. A prerequisite that was proposed by several students was sufficient education about the kit itself, and the consequences for one’s life after diagnosis is confirmed.
Finally, the success rate of this diagnostic kit in third-world countries was compared to western countries (The Netherlands) by asking the opinion of the students. Fifty percent believed that the use would be more accepted in The Netherlands because the Dutch population has a higher education level and would understand the purpose and the action of this kit and are thus more open to it. Here, people can afford health care and are used to novel techniques. About 30% believed that the use of this kit would be less accepted in The Netherlands because people are more aware of the dangers of GMO’s. Moreover, the health care in The Netherlands is satisfactory as it is. The other students were indecisive or thought there would not be a difference in acceptance levels.
When such a diagnostic kit would be available in The Netherlands, the ideal antigens to be detected according to the students are cancer and STDs. Moreover, Mono, HIV and Hepatitis B were mentioned, as well as tropical diseases for travelers.

Central Veterinary Institute The Central Veterinary Institute (CVI) is the bioveterinary research institute of Wageningen University & Research. Located in Lelystad, it is commissioned by the Dutch authorities and carries out research related to vaccine development, diagnostics and animal health in general. On the 10th of July, we gave an elaborate presentation on our project, during which we discussed the setup and story with the people at CVI.
Go/No-Go presentation In order to involve our colleagues at the university in our project, we gave a Go/No-Go presentation, where all researchers and students in the relevant chair groups were invited to attend. Here, we gave a comprehensive 20-minute presentation on our project, how far we had come, and how much we were still planning to do in the last few months before the Jamboree. Afterwards, the audience was able to ask questions and vote if we made enough progress to proceed and participate at the Giant Jamboree. We got some valuable input and tips on the science part of our project, as well as the way we tell our story. Luckily, more than 90 percent of the public voted for a 'go'!
Master students Biotechnology During the introduction week of the new academic year of Wageningen University & Research, we presented our project to the new batch of master students in Biotechnology. This way, we already taught them something about synthetic biology, and hopefully got them hooked on participating in iGEM next year! After the presentation, we got some great comments and several curious and interested students who wanted to know more.
Topsector Chemie One of our team members pitched our project at the annual Topsector Chemie closing ceremony in Wageningen, at the 30th of August. This short pitch focussed on the challenges we face in using synthetic biology. Topsector Chemie is an organization with the goal to find solutions to big social challenges. These are the so-called Grand Societal Challenges by the Horizon 2020 program of the European Commission. Topsector Chemie approaches these challenges from a chemical point of view, collaborating with other top sectors wherever possible.
SynCity The SynCity event was organized by the Laboratory of Systems & Synthetic Biology at Wageningen University & Research. The event was a film and art festival held on the 5th and 6th of October about synthetic biology to involve the general public in this field. Here, both citizens, scientists and students could discover the field of synthetic biology and how it can be used for many purposes. This is done from an artistic point of view. Via art, synthetic biology is depicted, for example with a series of short movies. Together with iGEM Wageningen 2014, we presented our view and projects.
Moreover, as follow-up of the SynCity days two dialogue evenings were organised in which synthetic biology issues were discussed. These evenings were set up as workshops and were open to the general public. This was a nice opportunity for us to discover the different interpretations of synthetic biology and the chances or pitfalls it offers for society according to the general public. This also included a discussion on the role of implication analysis and risk evaluation in science. Staff members mentioned that in their daily work, not much attention was paid to thinking about the societal implications of their studies, although it becomes a more and more important part of acquiring funding or approval of research proposals. A consensus was reached that discussions such as these are important for both scientists and the general public to exchange their visions and expectations of synthetic biology and its implications. This way, the field of synthetic biology will become both highly innovative while being publicly accepted. This shows again that public engagement is an important part of projects such as iGEM, and science in general.",,Engaged with the public to spread awareness of synthetic biology and share information about their project with the rest of the world.,,,

Use the received feedback to guide the project.",Integrated Human Practices,"We started by finding a relevant case in which our device could make a contribution. Through a conversation with a veterinarian, we were advised to narrow our scope to mastitis, an udder infection affecting dairy cows.
""Every milk farmer faces mastitis, a challenging udder disease affecting dairy cows."" Bouwe Gall Frank (veterinarian)
This infection is not easy to get rid of; udders are exposed to the open environment, making the infection a common re-occurrence. All dairy farmers we spoke to in the Netherlands have had to deal with mastitis. Farmers want to have fast administration of antibiotics when treating this disease, as time is of the essence. Our tool makes sure that fast treatment of mastitis can be done in a responsible way, without misusing antibiotics, thereby helping to prevent the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Looking to mastitis, we adapted our tool to detect relevant resistance genes in the common pathogen, Staphylococcus Aureus (SAU), causing this disease.
""It is relevant to be able to detect SAU pathogens. As there is a huge difference in sensitivity for antibiotics considering MRSA, it would be added value to have a conclusive result on the sensitivity."" Maaike van den Berg (veterinarian)
After talking to experts with expertise in mastitis from the Wageningen Bioveterinary Research Center in Lelystad, we found that detecting the mecA and blaZ genes was the way to go.
""MecA can be used to detect resistance against all β-lactam antibiotics."" Fimme van der Wal (agricultural researcher)
""Detection of blaZ is a conclusive result to exclude commonly used penicillin treatment."" Dik Mevius (agricultural researcher)
For further information about these genes check out our applied design and demonstrate page.
After defining our end-users and detection goal, we looked at how we could make our device as user-friendly as possible. From the start of our project, we wanted to integrate the use of tardigrade intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) which are able to maintain the functionality of other proteins upon desiccation. This fitted perfectly in our design with respect to our end-users, as our TDPs enable the transportation and storage of our detection tool at room temperature. Normally, protein function can be maintained when stored at -80 degrees celsius, something that is not always available at your local dairy farm! We also envisioned that this improved storage method will be advantageous for shipping our versatile RNA-detection tool for broader applications. For further information on our TDPs, check out our TDP design page.
Adding to the storability, we realised that our tool needed to give a readout visible to the naked eye. At a farm, there are no fancy lasers or microscopes, so we had to get creative! We started by designing a microfluidics paper chip with GMOs with a kill switch to detect resistance genes, but gained crucial feedback on this.
Even if GMO kill switches were reliable, there is no public acceptance to use GMOs in the environment. If it will be accepted in the future, it will take years from now to legislate this principle. Innovation based on this gets stuck. Cecile van der Vlugt (Risk Assessor GMO)
This led us to come up with a new application: CINDY-Seq. This method allows for a simple yes or no answer to the question: is the pathogen causing mastitis in my cow resistant to penicillins, or even all β-lactamases depending on the design of Cas13a, in a matter of hours, without the use of GMOs in the environment. For more information on how CINDY-Seq works, please visit our coacervation design page.
Now that we completed the design of our detection tool, we needed to look at how we could make the sample preparation as simple as possible for a farmer, as farmers like to do most things themselves.
We try to do most things by ourselves to prevent high bills from the veterinarian. Tjerkje Poppinga (dairy farmer)
In the case of mastitis, the pathogen is present in the milk of the infected cow. By hitting the books and optimising existing protocols, we came up with an easy method to prepare a fresh milk sample for the detection tool. To know more about which methods we came up with, look at our sample prep design page where we describe this extensively.
Finally, our integrated human practices strategy helped us to think a step further about our design, regarding, for example, the costs involved in our device and what it should actually look like; what kind of ‘kit’ will it be and what will it contain? We also looked at the feasibility of our device in the context of whether or not farmers would actually be allowed to use such a device and what needs to be done considering legislation to make this possible.
Only veterinarians can prescribe or change antibiotic treatments. Engeline van Duijkeren (veterinarian) ",7 experts listed,"There were several interactions with stakeholders that heavily impacted the direction of our design. Integrated Human Practices was extremely valuable in shaping our project. In response to dialogues with the public, risk assessors, and potential users, we changed our design from a GMO-based lab tool to a safe and reliable end product. Key points that we took from discussions with stakeholders were that the method needs to combine a simplified sample preparation, a fast, easy readout and the possibility for on-site use. We integrated all these in our project, by designing a cell-free method that can be stored for up to two weeks and produces a visible readout.
Stakeholder interactions shaped our final design and made it feasible to transform our detection method into an application, resulting in a toolbox with which the farmers can perform the resistance test themselves on-site, instead of being dependent on slow lab processes. Simple, cheap and safe methods - for example the hand-powered centrifuge and boiling method during sample preparation, together with an optimized readout - make our device applicable for rapid frontline diagnostics. We developed our toolbox to detect the most relevant multiple antibiotic resistance genes, expanding the impact of our product to achieve better animal and human treatment strategies.",,Reached out to agricultural researchers and dairy farmers to guide to guide the project.,,,

Potential application Our detection system can be used to indicate the requirement of alternative treatments. The rise of (multi)resistant bacteria not only triggers a debate about responsible antibiotic usage, but also provides incentive to look for alternative treatment options. We spoke to entrepreneurs and shareholders in a company that provides phage-therapy that is particularly beneficial when antibiotics fail to dispose of a persistent bacterial infection. In this way, our novel detection system can complement phage-therapy and provide a complete workflow to help farmers get rid of a troublesome infection.
Commercialization Several business developers were interested to learn about our innovative approach as a novel synbio application to help solve societally-relevant problems. The first question they ask after the project description is: “What did you do to protect your idea?” Filing a patent, for example, is an important step to secure investment and be able to take the idea to develop the product.

It was advised to build a prototype of the map so we could assess the behaviour of the user. it was suggested that the prototype must contain a limited amount of countries such as the one belonging to the G20 group.Datas must be collected from the prototype so that the project can answer to the visitor’s need. In order to get those datas, the prototype would display a restricted amount of information and the website would be fully accessible only when the survey is filled. This ensure the degree of data filling. Other ways include offering visibility and advertising from partners.
We met Mr Pujol and Mr Rémondet: “Scientific officers” at HBC to enlighten us on all questions concerning GMOs. The HCB is responsible for informing the public decision. It advises us on all matters of biotechnology, including genetically modified organisms (GMOs). During this interview, we presented our project to our interlocutors to know their point of view and to get advice to improve our presentation. We particularly discussed about some techniques to do “GMOs” accepted by the laws by using New Plants Breeding Techniques. They also help us to place our project in a GMO category for the society security.

The goal of this meeting was to discussed about the place of synthetic biology in the current economy context. Our interview with Mrs. Roure was at the beginning of our iGEM adventure! She helped us build our human practices and advised us to address certain point such as the toxicological study or the sustainable soil development. We also discussed a long time about the killswitch system and she gives us some idea to develop one. Mrs Roure has been very helpful for this aspect of the competition. She found us many contacts in order to have the the best expertise for our project.
Plant protection conversation at UIPP with Mrs Eugénia Pommaret - 09/12/2017
The goal of this meeting was to talk about the plant protection and specifically on the regulation and the communication around the agricultural world. This company called IUPP worked on the development of good practices for farmers. Eugénia Pommaret the executive director of UIPP (union of industry for the protection of the plant) met us in order to help us in the elaboration of our project softer shock. She advised us to look at the European regulations because it will define what our biological solution is. Currently, winegrowers are using pheromones produced by genetically modified bacteria. This technique is completely allowed in France and we can try to follow this example in order to place our biological solution on the French market.
Plant protection conversation with Mr Bocquet Director of the European Crop Protection Association (ECPA) - 07/12/2017  The goal of this meeting was to talk about the plant protection with Mr Bocquet former director of the European Crop Protection Association. He helped us to enhance our presentation and gives us pieces of advice such as emphasizing the cold shock part as a marketing priority (for vineyards, specifically). Mr Bocquet has been very helpful for the human practices part of the iGEM competition. He provide us contacts in order to have the best expertise for our project.
Climate change conversation with Mr Pauthier working as terroir Project Manager at Comité champagne - 07/01/2017 The goal of this interview was to understand the main climate changes affecting the vineyard in France. We discussed about the dangers of cold temperature and also how winemakers can reduce the impact of frost with the help of particular devices. This year, the frost during the spring resulted in a loss of 70% of the grapevines in the region of Bordeaux and a loss of 25% in Champagne. Several techniques to counter these losses are used by professionals in this sector. However it is often expensive and water consuming. At the end of the meeting, Mr Pauthier offers to us the possibility to do some experimentation in their institution. If the proof of concept is successful, a partnership will be done between the iGEM Paris Ionis team and the Comité Champagne in order to perform some tests in the field.
Climate change conversation with Mrs Sylviane Leplatre engineer in agronomy and oenologist giving advice to the winemakers in the region of Paris - 08/17/17 The goal of this interview was to understand the main climate changes affecting the vineyard in France and more specifically the south of France affected by very hot summer. We discussed about the dangers of cold and hot temperature and also how winemakers can reduce the impact of frost and heat with the help of particular devices. Mrs Leplatre think that our project is a good idea because global warming affecting the vineyards are the problem of the year. It was the first time that the south of the France has suffered from frost. There has been 10 % to 15% less production this year because of hail, frost or drought. As long as your product has no impact on health, she sees no inconvenience in advising the vine growers to use this solution on their vineyards. She also give us some advice on our product. If our solution are working on the vine it will be necessary to irrigate the vineyard in addition because the soil will be dry too and it will be not enough to have only our solution.
The 5th of September we were invited by Agrauxine the business unit of the group LESAFRE PLANT CARE. They are specialise in the development of products from microorganisms for crop protection. We had the opportunity to met with Mrs. PROFIZI CAMILLE (R&D director), Mr. RONAN KEMPF (Marketing and Development director) and Mrs.GARRIGUES CHRISTELLE (R&D representative from Lesaffre in Angers). We presented our project to our interlocutors to know their point of view and to get pieces of advice to improve our presentation. They were very interested in our project and gave us some tips, to present the project to others companies in the same field, what we should delve deeper such as the safety and applied design part about our project and what we should conceal or place in the middle of the presentation to avoid troubles especially in France such as the term GMO and direct contact with the environment. Unfortunately they weren’t able to finance the project due to the company image in France but in exchange they put us in contact with several experts in the French Agriculture regulation like the ANSES and the contact of someone in the United States GMO regulation. It was a very pleasant experience, to talk to professionals in the plant care, have their opinion about SofterShock and share scientific knowledge. We certainly developed our professional communication skills!
Plant protection conversation with Syngenta - 10/02/2017 The 10th of october, we were invited by Syngenta a biotechnology company that conducts genomic research. We met Mrs Lebas Marie-Cecile (Public Affairs Director) Mr Thevenot Xavier (Strategic Cooperation Director) and Michel Petit (R&D Head). The goal of this interview was to talk about our project in order to improve it.They were very interested in our project and gave us some tips, to present the project at the Giant jamboree in November. They help us to understand which part of our presentation needed to be clearly explain such as the R&D and safety part. We also re-think about the real interest for farmers to have a thermo-sensitive and autonomous system. For future perspectives, we talked in a second part about how we can limit the regulation problems by transforming an organism and then induce a horizontal gene transfer to our chassis (directed mutagenesis).",9,This set of interviews were particularly valuable because they provided skills and connections which will continue to be helpful even after the team picks a new project for next year. ,,"We interviewed experts in plant protection, law, and economics to understand the effect that softer shock would have in the business world.

",,"We learned that the majority of researchers’ idea source is professional research articles and journals, they work before, but a novel idea may arouse from them if the researcher reuses their essence and aims to an accessible direction. However, each paper usually describes its design in the author’s own style and standard, which is usually hard to understand and absorb its design ideas for one’s own creative work.
How to come up with an idea or to trigger one’s inspiration is a challenge for us, because “inspiration” is such an abstract concept, and is hard to measure.
