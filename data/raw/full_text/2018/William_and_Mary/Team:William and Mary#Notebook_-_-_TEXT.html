Planned out several IFFLs to test.
Week 2: 180604 -180610
Continued cloning 3G parts onto our standard WM Pad backbone
Redesigned primers for cloning 3G promoter parts, as previous ones were faulty
Received results from sequencing, confirmed parts
Beginning to assemble circuits using 3G assembly
Making inducible reporter construct and an mf-Lon based IFFL
Week 3: 180611 -180617
Completed cloning the portion of our comprehensive 3G assembly part library needed for our circuits
Adding remaining 3G parts from Murray’s lab to our library
Working on designing and building a dual inducible promoter and low copy backbone for assembly
Confirmed minipreps based on sequencing results
Started plate reader for experiments on circuits with IPTG and ATC inducer
Started using FACS machine for experiments
Week 4: 180618 - 180624
Microscopy training with Jacob Sawyer, advanced imaging specialist from Nikon
Spin down inducer tests to see if we can remove inducer from media to create pulses
Plate reader experiment of pulse timing in different conditions
FACs experiment of how long cells can be incubated on ice without changing results
Decided to stop sequencing 3G parts and start functionally screening them instead
Set up our first Golden Gate reaction
Madilyn & Friends Outreach event
Week 5: 180625 -180701
Continue designing and building circuits
Continue inducer spin down tests for plate reader experiment
Reached out to St. Andrews to solidify collaboration partnership
Considering alternatives for the inducer spin down tests due to multiple complications
Looked into light-induced gene expression systems
SEP 8th graders
Week 6: 180702 -180708
Experienced some leakiness with our FACS machine, spent time fixing this
Abandoned light-induced gene expression system, as it appears impractical in lab and less relevant to in vivo systems
Began looking into temperature-induced circuits
Continue inducer spin down tests
Making different variants of the same circuit with different strength repressors
Made and characterized Oscillator Circuit
Cell sorting with GS, image dissociated cells on the slides
Started Interlab Study measurements
Week 7: 180709 -180715
Successfully cloned our entire 3G library, except recently added parts
Demonstrated cells can be frozen in 15% glycerol without changing results
Successfully tested whether inducers can be removed from media
Using parts from last year, tested an IFFL with a single 20 minute pulse
Tested an IFFL with a single 40 minute pulse
Began assembling and testing circuits utilizing temperature as an inducer (TS-C1 system)
Attended the Mid-Atlantic Meetup hosted by University of Maryland
Submitted Interlab measurements
Week 8: 180716 -180722
