Attributions
The William and Mary iGEM team is deeply grateful to all who supported the team throughout the year. Behind our team is a community of supporters, whether advisors, friends, or sponsors, and our project would not have been possible without them.
Advisors
We would like to thank Dr. Margaret Saha for the instrumental role she played in our project. As our PI and team advisor, she has poured a great amount of energy into ensuring our team has the tools we need to succeed. Her dedication and boundless enthusiasm have been invaluable and for this we are forever grateful. We would also like to thank Dr. Patel for his guidance with our math modeling; he has gone above and beyond in mentoring the math team.
Other Acknowledgements
We’d like to thank Dr. Eric Bradley for his assistance with lab facilities, Dr. Mark Forsyth, and Dr. Joshua Puzey. We’d also like to thank Jacob Sawyer, advanced imaging specialist, for his microscopy guidance.
We would also like to thank John Marken our student advisor for his assistance in developing the conceptual framework of our project, as well as for his mentoring of our math team and for his invaluable advice on the presentation of our project.
Special thanks to Andy Halleran of Richard Murray Lab at the California Institute of Technology for his technical support and for providing us with a starter set of 3G compatible parts as well as protocols and advice on using them.

Statement of work
All work was performed by the undergraduate members of unless indicated otherwise. Our three high school trainees (Nitin Arora, Nikhil Arora and Davis Hatcher) helped us with some of our molecular cloning work in July (Colony PCRs, Gel electrophoresis) as a hands on experience to help them get acquainted with molecular cloning techniques while they designed their projects.   All text, figures code, and experiments were conceived, designed and implemented by the team, with advising from our PIs and our student advisors.
