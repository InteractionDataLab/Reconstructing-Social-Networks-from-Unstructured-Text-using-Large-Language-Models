In order to determine the appropriate expression levels of various component genes, our project required us to create and test many circuit variants.  To efficiently design and clone circuits containing multiple transcriptional units, we implemented a recently designed method of circuit construction called 3G Assembly , which enables quick and modular cloning of circuits. Furthermore, mixed 3G Assembly can be used to build, test, and subsequently clone vast numbers of circuit variants in a single day. .
Since we anticipate this method to be extremely valuable to future iGEM teams, we submitted approximately 70 parts in a 3G compatible format. These parts include some of the most commonly used basic parts used by iGEM teams, as well as basic parts from our project and parts from our collaborators at UVA.
Our 3G part library consists of 4 categories: Promoter, 5â€™ UTR (UnTranslated Regions), Coding sequence and Terminator. Most of the variants in each category are used for tuning the relative expression level between the reporter (mScarlet) and the protease (mf-Lon). We can also easily modify degradation rate by switching the degradation tag in mScarlet, changing the strength of the promoter regulating mf-Lon, or adding a degradation tag to mf-Lon (a ssrA tag).
In our collection of parts, we also incorporated the ts-CI heat inducible system and TlpA heat inducible system, which we used extensively during the testing of our temperature sensitive IFFL circuits.
In total, while our parts collection already encompasses many of the commonly used registry parts, we hope that future teams will continue to add to it. We hope that this 3G library will prove an invaluable tool for other teams hoping to implement 3G assembly in their own labs.
