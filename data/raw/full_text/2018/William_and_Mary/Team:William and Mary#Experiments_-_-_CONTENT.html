In the interest of promoting reproducible science, and enabling others to build off of our work, we have included both the precise methods used as well as the raw data (in csv format) for every experiment mentioned on our wiki. Experiments are split up by the page on which they are mentioned. For experiments performed with flow cytometry, .fcs files for both measurements and calibration beads (Spherotek RCP-30-5A, lot number: AB01) are included in the file. In all cases at least 10,000 single cell measurements were collected for flow cytometry data.  Whenever used, the term biological replicates refers to a distinct colony from a transformation of the same miniprep. Whenever plate reader fluorescence data is provided, it is given in arbitrary units of fluorescence normalized to cell density (recorded in either Absorbance 600 or Absorbance 700).
