Project Achievements
Confirmed the biological theory behind a mathematical model of signal processing
Designed novel experimental protocols for the characterization of dynamic circuits .
Implemented 3G Assembly , a new method of DNA Assembly that enables the construction of multi-transcriptional unit circuits in a single day.
Modeling Achievements
Created an abstract model of an IFFL and determined that IFFLs are capable of performing as temporal distinguishers.
Created a mathematical model of our temperature controlled decoding system and determined that it functions effectively as a decoder, being far more effective than a naive (non IFFL system)
Determined that our decoding circuit is robust to noisy inputs .
Investigated the impact of degradation strength on the decoding circuit, finding that tuning of degradation rates can further improve the decoding ability of the system.
