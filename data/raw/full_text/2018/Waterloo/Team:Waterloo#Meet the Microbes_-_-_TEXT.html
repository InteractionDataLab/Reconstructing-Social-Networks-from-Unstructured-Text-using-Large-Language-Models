Meet the Microbes
Strain: Escherichia coli JT2 SKA974 . This strain has been engineered for optogenetic control using CcaS/R. Its genomic MetE gene is under control of the CcaS/R promoter. It also has a Kanamycin resistance gene in its genome.
Plasmids:
pSR43.6r (CcaS, its photoreceptor, p15A origin of replication)
pSR58.6 (CcaR, sfGFP under the CcaR promoter, ColeI origin of replication)
Note that we made two versions of this strain. One contains both these plasmids, unaltered, and was used for characterization  experiments. We cut GFP out of pSR58.6 for the second version of this strain, and used it for non-characterization experiments.
Antibiotic Resistance(s): Kanamycin, Spectinomycin, Chloramphenicol
Fluorescent Marker: GFP in the characterization version of this strain, only expressed when CcaS/R is activated.
Can produce methionine? Yes, but only when CcaS/R is activated.
