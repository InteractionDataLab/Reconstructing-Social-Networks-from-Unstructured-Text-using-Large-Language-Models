This year, our team biobricked the MetE gene into a cassette with LacI promoter: BBa_K2573000 . This can be cloned into a methionine auxotroph to restore its ability to produce methionine. The MetE coding sequence can also be PCR amplified out of this biobrick and assembled into a new plasmid for a variety of applications. For instance, it can be put under the control of an optogenetic promoter/system (like CcaS/R or pDawn).
