INTRODUCTION
To address the lack of accessibility to synthetic biology due to the high costs and the level of knowledge required among others, our team has designed Printeria, a fully-equipped bioengineering device capable of automating the process of printing genetic circuits in bacteria.
To ensure a functional, economical and easy-to-use design, collaboration between the hardware and the wet lab teams has been necessary throughout the development process. After several drafts we have achieved a unique design that can be easily transported and replicated at a cost not exceeding xxx € (xxx $). [and whose cost does not exceed xxx €]
Printeria is divided into three main parts dependent on each other:
Entry of consumables: components that allow the entry of consumables into the reaction zone.
Reaction zone: space where the process of printing genetic circuits in bacteria occurs thanks to digital microfluidic technology.
Measurement zone: the bacteria are kept in conditions that allow for growth and expression while OD and fluorescence measurements are taken.

STRUCTURE
Frame
First of all, it is necessary to design a structure that confines all the elements necessary for the operation of the device inside it and also allows the creation of a sterile atmosphere to carry out the biological reactions.
In order to facilitate its transport, aluminum has been chosen for the frame, which in addition to its low weight, has other great qualities such as great resistance to corrosion and low cost.
It has been used 15x15x1mm square tube profiles joined by plastic corner connectors obtaining as a result a 415x360x280mm chassis. Thanks to the generated blueprints we have been able to contact a company specializing in cutting and handling aluminum that has provided us with all the parts as we required. As it was not possible for us to find plastic connectors that fit our needs, we have decided to design these parts ourselves and then print them on a 3D printer.
Aluminum frame
Methacrylate
To complete the structure, it is necessary to create walls that are attached to this frame and contribute to its stability.  We have opted for the use of methacrylate due to its attractive appearance, durability and scratch resistance.
As well as the aluminum profiles, the blueprints created were used for ordering the custom-made parts to a company.
Methacrylate cladding
Finally, 4mm diameter countersunk head screws DIN 7991 (M4 L25) and nuts DIN 934 (M4), both made of galvanized steel, were used for joining the methacrylate plates to the frame.
Leveling system
Given the great importance of keeping the reaction zone perfectly horizontal, it is necessary to use levelling feet. In addition, for checking the horizontal position, a bull’s eye level has been installed next to the reaction zone.
