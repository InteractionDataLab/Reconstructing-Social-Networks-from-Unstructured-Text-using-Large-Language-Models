Abstract
Access to Synthetic Biology by an interested layperson is currently hampered by several barriers, including a required background knowledge and availability of expensive and often bulky technological equipment. Printeria is a fully-equipped bioengineering device able to automate the process of printing genetic circuits in bacteria but made as simple and easy to operate as a domestic desktop printer. It breaks down these barriers using a digital microfluidic system creating little droplets that can be mixed and moved across predefined electrode paths on a PCB surface. Printeria combines this novel system with Golden Gate Technology, low-cost sensors and electronics, and a user-friendly software application. In this way, the user is capable of assembling DNA parts in a one-step reaction and control all steps: from the parts assembly and transformation to perform experiments of the printed genetic circuit with high accuracy. Printeria opens the door to a world of applications affordable for the general public.
