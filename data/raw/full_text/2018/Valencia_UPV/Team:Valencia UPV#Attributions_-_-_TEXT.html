Design and domestication of DNA basic parts for the GB 3.0. grammar and transcriptional unit assemblies were accomplished by Carolina Ropero, Adrián Requena and Alberto Coronado (wet lab team).
PhD Marta Vázquez, Instructor and PhD Diego Orzáez, PI, from the IBMCP (UPV- CSIC), provided us the destination Level 1 vectors for the Golden Gate Cloning system and introduced us to the basic knowledge about the Golden Braid 3.0 grammar. They also provided economical support for lab reagents and consumables.
Prof. Jesús Picó, PI of this IGEM Team gave us general advices in all the aspects of the Project. He provided many of the resources we needed for the execution of the project and let us work in his lab during this summer.
PhD Nuria Andrés Colás, gave us advice on how to make competent bacteria and how to deal with them. She also gave us a great insight into how to deal with Biology with people without knowledge in this field.
PhD Alejandro Vignoni, Secondary PI and PhD Yadira Boada, Instructor, let us work in their laboratory space and taught us most of the techniques we have applied in the development of the biological part of Printeria.
Laura Campos Beneyto, from the Biotechnology-Biochemistry department (ETSIAMN-UPV), gave us technical support to continue the wet lab schedule when our thermocycler was broken.
