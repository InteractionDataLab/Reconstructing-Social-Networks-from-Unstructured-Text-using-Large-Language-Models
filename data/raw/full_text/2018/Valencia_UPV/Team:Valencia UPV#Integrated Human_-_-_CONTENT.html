</P><P>As a result, our first step was to identify the <B>real-life problems</B> that could be solved with Printeria and so <B>classify its application fields</B>. To do so, we decided to employ a tip given by Israel (researcher at UPV)  the <B>MIT market segmentation table</B> . This table allows you to classify all users you think your product could be interesting to buy on the basis of several questions. Using it we analyzed Printeria potential users in accordance with our project values.

Maria and Memo met by coincidence</B>.</P><P>In this aspect, Printeria could help to approach artists to scientists.</P></LI><LI><P><B>Presevation of bioart plates is one of the biggest problems. The best way to preserve them is leaving the plates in the fridge. But using epoxy or other resins can help preservation.</B></P><P>We leave them on the fridge and we are trying to fix them by using transparent nail polish.</P></LI><LI><P><B>Consider working by layers when working with different types of bacteria. The slow growers should go first and after growing them, fast growers should be added.</B></P><P>As we are only working with E. coli, we are having no problems. But this piece of advice should be taken into account if Printeria ends up using other different chassis than just E. coli strains.</P></LI><LI><P><B>They don’t create their own GM microorganisms, so they think Printeria could be a useful machine to do so. Memo encourages us to write a manuscript out of this, even if the machine does not totally work. This could make people start using it so that Printeria could evolve</B>.</P><P>The idea of doing a manuscript caught our eyes and we are planning to do so. It also made us think about creating the ‘Printeria user manual’ as well as an activity booklet for the user to learn even more about SynBio.</P></LI><LI><P><B>Do not only focus on creating colourful bacteria but on stand-alone scent pathways</B>.</P><P>We achieved to create mint scented E.coli but we will continue doing some research in stand-alone scent pathways. </P></LI><LI><P><B>For doing bioart, just try different techniques: using glass beads, pipetting liquid cultures, using sowing handles.</B></P><P> We knew nothing about bioart and, thanks to Maria and Memo, we started developing our skills to quickly learn the basics about this type of art. We used the pipetting method to create Yturralde’s living art and the sowing handles for creating Printeria’s logo and for letting students create their own masterpieces in MAG.</P></LI><LI><P><B>Memo thinks Printeria is a nice multidisciplinary project. He encourages us to show who we are, and the way we learnt to speak a common language in which biotechnologists, engineers, designers and informatics, understood each other.</B></P><P>It is very important for people to know that Printeria is more than just a biotechnological project. It is a machine in which lots of different disciplines worked together with a single goal. And this piece of advice really helped us while creating our poster and while planning our Giant Jamboree’s presentation.</P></LI><LI><P><B>It could be graeat for people to touch Printeria. Take it to Boston and try to do a live performance during the Jamboree.

He is the discoverer of the CRISPR-Cas systems whose application would later be researched by Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna among others. </P><P>In Spain, he is one of the most reputable researchers and as such, his opinion and advice are worth their price in gold.  Mojica accepted our invitation for a personal interview in which we would present the project and ask him for advice. The interview was carried out by Carolina Ropero, member of the Printeria team.

However, he warned us about the importance of being aware of the decisions to make, even if a device such Printeria is able to do all the process by itself.</B></P><P>
To avoid the user lack of awareness, we decided to develop a <B>Simulation tool</B>, so the user could simulate the experiments in silico. Thus, this functionality  provides the user with a quantitative, mathematical description to ensure the rational decision making. </P></LI><LI><P><B>He believes that, from the education point of view, the automation is detrimental to the observation. He also pointed out the necessity of training the teaching stuff, as they are not often used to SynBio.</B></P><P> In order to ensure the students understanding of the biology that is behind each step, we decided to develop a Printeria basic <B>user-guide</B>. Moreover, we implemented <I>recipes</I> in our software tool. <B>Recipes</B> are already pre-defined experiments that include an easy ID name such as “pink colour”, so in this way the most basic user can understand what he/she is printing and so the biological reason of the final result. </P></LI><LI><P><B>Biosafety measures are completely necessary to ensure Printeria  introduction in non-scientific environments.
</B></P><P>We realized it was necessary to improve our <B>safety measurements</B>. Mojica advised us the use of <B>UV light filters</B> as bacterial-killer, which were positively integrated into Printeria final design.
</P></LI><LI><P><B>He advised us to be aware about the vocabulary used to divulgue science, as it needs to be technically correct but close and safe enough for the lay public to listen to you.
</B></P><P>This, along with the bioartist expert feedback, gave us the idea to use a non-usual approach to <B>divulgue SynBio</B> into the lay-public. As a consequence, Printeria promotion among society was carried out by including the <B>BioArt</B> as the main attraction to get to the public.

The fact is that it is not without reason, as in Spain there have been many television media and laboratories that have ignored us, for example TVE (Spanish Television) or A3 (Antena tres) which are very important TV channels in our country.

Well, we decided to copy what flow cabins do. Based on this  we decided to use UV led lights to achieve this objective. Furthermore we have programmed an especial reaction that use little droplets with HCl and ethanol to clean and ensure we have perfectly sterilized the PCB.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P><B>Sterilization of the microfluidic tubes</B></P></TD><TD><P>The reaction fluid is going to pass through microfluidic tubes and it will contaminate them, to reverse this situation we will use the same special program wich usses droplets with ethanol and HCl.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P><B>Protection of the user</B></P></TD><TD><P>We want the user to see what is happening inside Printeria but also we want them to be protected if something wrong happens inside. Thats why we thought that a metacrilate box that cover the machines would be a nice option. Besides, it is useful to pin up the elements which will be part of Printera.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P><B>Overheating of the PCB</B></P></TD><TD><P>As the PCB has a cold and a hot zone, it is necessary to evacuate the heat generated. The hot zone can achieve more than 80º degrees and can be a potential danger. A resisitance is responsible of heating and a peltier plate is responsible of chilling. Peltier effect is based in a semiconductor metal where you apply a potential difference. Then, you create a hot part and a cold one in that semiconductor. We use the cold part to extract the energy and stabilize the temperature via conduction of the PCB's hot zone.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P><B>Ventilation</B></P></TD><TD><P>The peltier plate is responsible of chilling the PCB but ¿How do we evacuate all the energy generated? Well, the answer is simple, Printeria just needed ventilation holes and watercooling to do it. Watercooling is based in the higher thermal capacity of fluids (water in this case) to absorb energy. Water is pumped through microfluidic tubes to reach the peltier and chill it.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P><B>Electroporator</B></P></TD><TD><P>This device is capable to reach high voltages, so if you require one of these in your design first of all, ensure no one can harm himself/herself. This is the reason why we designed our own electroporator in a dedicated and compacted printed circuit to isolate it from any exposure. It can reach until 1600V, which is not a joke.
