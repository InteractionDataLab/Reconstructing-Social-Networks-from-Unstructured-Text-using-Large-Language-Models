Introduction
As we have explained in our design page , we are using the Golden Gate assembly method. But we have a problem: there is not a part collection as complete as the BioBrick collection.
In order to solve this, we have create an extensive Part collection of characterized basic parts (promoters, RBS, CDS and terminator)  following the GoldenBraid 3.0 standard, and so also compatible with PhytoBricks standard (rfc 106). We have used these parts to create new transcriptional units, such as the ones that Printeria users will be able to construct.
