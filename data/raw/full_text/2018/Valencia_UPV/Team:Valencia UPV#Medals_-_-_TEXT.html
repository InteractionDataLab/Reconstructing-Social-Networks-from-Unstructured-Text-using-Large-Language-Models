Medal criteria summary
This web page is made to ease judges the review of medal criteria. Our main objective is to arrive at Spain with a gold medal inside our suitcases. Will we have achieved it?
Bronze
Registration
Our team application was accepted on 2018/05/15 as we can see in this link: iGEM Valencia_UPV registration .
Competition Deliverables
Wiki/Poster/Presentation: The wiki page was finalized on 17 october as the deadline indicated. The poster and the presentation will be shown in the Giant Jamboree.
Judging form: Judging form was submited on 12 october and is visible for judges since that deadline.
Attributions
To visibilize attributions with the importance it deserves we made an special web page, visit it in the Attributions page .
Characterization
We have succesfully carried out the InterLab Study. You can check our results by going to InterLab page .
We have also provided experimental characterization data for the sfGFP coding sequence BBa_I746916 .
Silver
Validated part
We have made a complete Printeria Part Collection . An example of a validated part is the BBa_K2656021 basic DNA piece. It is the YFP coding sequence standardized into the Golden Braid 3.0. grammar, so being compatible with both BioBrick and Golden Gate assembly method.
Collaborations
iGEM would not be what it is whithout interaction between teams. We have done five collaborations during all this summer. To check out what we have done please go to our collaborations page .
Human Practices
Our Human Practices is focused on Printeria integration. We have done a social engagement work with the aim of exploring Printeria potential both artistic and education applications through society. Furthermore we have applied an innovative tool to integrate feedback in Printeria. To see more please, go to: Human Practices Printeria .
Gold
Integrated Human
The way we used our Human Practices work to improve and adapt the design of Printeria can be read in the next link: Integrated Practices in Printeria .
Project modeling
Modeling is one of the central axes of Printeria. By this way, the user will know beforehand what results is going to obtain with Printeria. Want to see more? Check out the Modeling page .
Improve previus part
The part we improved is: BBa_K592101 . We did this improvement by creating the new part BBa_K2656020 . This is an adaptation of the original one adding the LVA degradation tag and standardizing the piece for its use in the assembly of transcriptional units with the Golden Gate method. For more information, check out our Improve page .
Demonstrate
In order to demonstrate Printeria potential functioning, we have included each proof-of-concept of Printeria individual pieces and the most relevant wet lab experiments. You can check it going to the Demonstrate page .
