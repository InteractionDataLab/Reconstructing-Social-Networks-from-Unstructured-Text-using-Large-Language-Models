What We Do
The  burning  of  fossil  fuels  generates  greenhouse  gases  that  are  damaging  the  atmosphere  and  impacting  the  global  environment.  Energy  from  sustainable  sources  such  as  wind  and  solar  is  difficult  to  store  for  times  when  the  wind  is  not  blowing  or  the  sun  is  not  shining.
In  order  to  build  a  sustainable  energy  source  for  energy  on  demand  we  are  creating  a  system  using  living  organisms.  E.  coli  will  be  engineered  to  synthesize  lactate  which  will  then  be  used  to  feed  a  Shewanella  biofilm.  Shewanella  is  a  bacteria  that  can  transfer  electrons  to  a  cathode  and  produce  a  current  to  light  a  bulb.  The  community  will  be  involved  through  a  DNA  Code  Game  designed  for  middle  and  elementary  school  students  to  raise  awareness  of  synthetic  biology  and  iGEM.
Community Engagement
DNA Code Game
This table uses the same principles as our cells do to make proteins.   Use the code table to decipher the code that is given.A message is hidden within the code. To decipher the code to unlock the message, start from the middle of the code table work your way up to the end of the table. The letter at the outside of the table is the letter that you need for the code.   Then you can work in reverse and write a code to tell your friends about the PGH-RESISTORS

This Is The Story
We are strategically located in Guadalajara, the second most populated city in Mexico and responsible of 7% of national gross domestic product. Our goal in the long term is to fulfil the Mexican demand of medium and high purity chitosan and to become the first Mexican exporter of high purity chitosan. We want to create dream jobs for young Mexican engineers and export our biotechnology worldwide.
Biophrame Technologies is a biotech company and manufacturer specialized in the production of Chitosan.

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such "nuggets" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
