Energy  from  sustainable  sources  such  as  wind  and  solar  is  difficult  to  store  for  times  when  the  wind  is  not  blowing  or  the  sun  is  not  shining. </P><P>In  order  to  build  a  sustainable  energy  source  for  energy  on  demand  we  are  creating  a  system  using  living  organisms.  E.  coli  will  be  engineered  to  synthesize  lactate  which  will  then  be  used  to  feed  a  Shewanella  biofilm.  Shewanella  is  a  bacteria  that  can  transfer  electrons  to  a  cathode  and  produce  a  current  to  light  a  bulb.  The  community  will  be  involved  through  a  DNA  Code  Game  designed  for  middle  and  elementary  school  students  to  raise  awareness  of  synthetic  biology  and  iGEM. </P><H2>Community Engagement</H2><H3>DNA Code Game</H3><P>
  This table uses the same principles as our cells do to make proteins.
  Use the code table to decipher the code that is given.A message is hidden within the code. To decipher the code to unlock the message, start from the middle of the code table work your way up to the end of the table. The letter at the outside of the table is the letter that you need for the code.
  Then you can work in reverse and write a code to tell your friends about the PGH-RESISTORS

We are strategically located in Guadalajara, the second most populated city in Mexico and responsible of 7% of national gross domestic product. Our goal in the long term is to fulfil the Mexican demand of medium and high purity chitosan and to become the first Mexican exporter of high purity chitosan. We want to create dream jobs for young Mexican engineers and export our biotechnology worldwide.</P></VIDEO></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12 faceBot"><DIV class="col-md-2 col-md-offset-3"><SMALL style="color:white">Biophrame Technologies is a biotech company and manufacturer specialized in the production of Chitosan.</SMALL></DIV><DIV class="column full_size judges-will-not-evaluate"><H3>â˜…  ALERT! </H3><P>This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Judging/Medals">medal criterion</A> or <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Judging/Awards"> award listed below</A>. </P><P> Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal criterion and/or award.

In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship. 
</P><P>The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges! 


To compete for the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Judging/Awards">Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize</A>, please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Judging/Judging_Form">judging form</A>.

You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Here are a few examples:</P><UL><LI><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia">2016 Sydney Australia</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Pasteur_Paris">2016 Pasteur Paris</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:UCC_Ireland">2014 UCC Ireland</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Imperial">2014 Imperial College London</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><H3>Patents and intellectual property</H3><P>
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project. </P><P>This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision.
