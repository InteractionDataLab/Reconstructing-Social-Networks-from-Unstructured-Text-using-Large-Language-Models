Attributions
This page is your opportunity to explain what parts of your project you did and what was done by technicians, advisers, etc. This requirement is not about literature references - these can and should be displayed throughout your wiki.
Bronze Medal Criterion #3
All of the work done in your project must be attributed correctly on this page. You must clearly state the work that was done by the students on your team and note any work that was done by people outside of your team, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Please see the Medals requirements page for more details.

Does your institution teach an iGEM or synthetic biology course?
When did you start this course?
Are the syllabus and course materials freely available online?
When did you start your brainstorming?
When did you start in the lab?
When did you start working on  your project?

Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
