<B>Hobbies:</B> Watching soccer, dancing, watching movies, swimming and making new friends.

He had a passion about synthetic biology which inspired him to participate in IGEM and he is ready to continue with his career in synthetic biology.
<B>Personal words:</B> I have got an excellent experience with the team where i have learnt various skills in research especially in the field of molecular biology, interaction with different people from various universities and communication of scientific based information. Furthermore, I have come to know different companies that enhance synthetic biology like Twist bioscience, Promega, and IDT across the world.   </P></LI><LI><B>Alex Kyabarongo. (Team Leader)</B><P>
Alex is an undergraduate student at Makerere University in his third year pursuing a Ba. Veterinary Medicine with particular interest in PUBLIC HEALTH, EPIDEMILOGY and VETERINARY PREVENTIVE MEDICINE. He enjoys traveling especially with his dog in game parks, touring natural resources, but sometimes training leadership, motivation and mentorship to the young generation though a scientist ha-ha. Not forgetting his free time soccer fun and reading.

Why iGEM? As Synthetic Biology is a relatively young area of science, I feel there is a lot of unexplored territory to investigate, and that makes iGEM a particularly pioneering, exciting, and challenging research opportunity.
</P><P>“I have had great time being part of this amazing team of iGEM Makerere University 2018, I have learnt a lot, I have been transformed in the world of synthetic biology and its dynamics  and on how to deal with deadlines, I hope for the best at the jamboree in Boston.”

I am a student at Makerere University pursuing a Bachelor's in Veterinary Medicine currently in my third year. I am 20 years old and I have a passion for science and life. 

I joined the team because I wanted to find out more knowledge about Molecular and synthetic biology world. I also wanted a live platform to get to apply the newly acquired skills of computer science (especially in web design) with the making of the wiki.

I thank IGEM for I have obtained some experience which i will use on future projects.

I am a third year student at Makerere University pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Veterinary Medicine.

I love swimming, watching movies, visiting new places, interacting with people and making new friends.

I had love and a passion to find out about synthetic biology and this motivated me to join the team. 

I have had a very wonderful experience with my fellow team members and I got to learn a number of things which include; communication skills and research.

Age: 21years

I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Laboratory Technology

I am glad to be a part of the pioneer team from Makerere University.
</P></LI><LI><B>Lawrence Opiyo</B><P><B>Course:</B> Bachelor of Veterinary medicine  
<B>Description:</B> I am self motivated by challenges in the community and always seek to find better solutions to existing problems. I am therefore a brainstormer, invention enthusiast, innovator and forward free thinking individual.

Joining Igem Makerere team was an opportunity for me to contribute towards the championing of a technology that I believe holds the answer to many currrent problems, some whose solutions were never possible before. Think about the phrase &quot;plastic eating bacteria&quot; for example. It will change a lot in our country Uganda where plastic use is really frankly unregulated compared to many neighbouring contrives. It was the right project for this country. Synthetic biology is for me therefore a technology that is essential to the enhancement of life in the 21st century.

Through IGEM I have learned the complexities of developing an idea: how it needs commitment, focus, and cooperation with as many as can give a hand. You can never know who will actually come through for you so you can'tknow afford to write off someone at first sight. With this experience I can only look forward to many more projects in future both in the team and after Igem. Thank you IGEM, it was a worthwhile.
