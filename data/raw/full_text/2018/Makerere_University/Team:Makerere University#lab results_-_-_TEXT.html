Results
During the lab work we had many trials and we were able to analyse and got the results below. However we are still under lab analysis and preparation of the entire results and therefore by this date of the wiki freeze we are unable to document them on our wiki result page though they will be fully documented in our presentation and there after documented on the wiki after the uplift past the competitions.
Below are the results we got from restriction digest and plasmid extraction which were the early stages of the lab work after transformation.
