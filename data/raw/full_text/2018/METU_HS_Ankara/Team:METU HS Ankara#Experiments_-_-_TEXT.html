Experiments
As a part of our lab work, we’ve conducted numerous experiments with different protocols. The protocols we have used during our experiments were mostly based on the procedures of the companies which supplied us our genes and materials, including iGEM protocols. For example, for our Competent Cell Test, we’ve followed iGEM’s protocol; and for the plasmid isolation protocol, we’ve followed the protocol supplied by Nanobiz, our lab equipment provider.
Before starting each of our experiments, we have optimized and calculated the most suitable conditions. Below are the protocols we used as a result of our optimizations.
Resuspension of DNA in iGEM Kit Plates Protocol
Materials:
dH2O
iGEM Kit Plates
Pipette
Method:
With a pipette tip, punch a hole through the foil cover into the corresponding well of the part desired.
Pipette 10 µLof dH2O into the well. Pipette up and down several times and let sit for 5 minutes to make sure the dried DNA is fully resuspended. Resuspension will be in a crimson color, as the dried DNA has crisol dye.
Transform resuspended DNA into an eppendorf tube.
Competent Cell Preparation Protocol:
Buffer 1:
Potassium acetate 30 µL
RbCl 100 µL
CaCl 100 µL
87% glycerol 4,3 mL
Complete to 25 mL
Buffer 2:
MOPS 10 µL
RbCl 10 µL
CaCl 75 µL
87% glycerol 4,3 mL
Complete to 25 mL
Method:
Pipette 100 µL of grown KO11 into 10 mL LB with 2% glucose, incubate for 2 hrs at 37 ℃ till an OD value of 0,4-0,6 is reached.
Put 4,5 mL of cultures into falcon tubes, incubate on ice for 15 mins.
Centrifuge at 3500 RPM at 4 ℃ for 10 mins.
Discard supernatant.
Resuspend pellet on ice in ice-cold 650 µL of Buffer 1.
Centrifuge at 3500 RPM at 4 ℃ for 5 min.
Discard supernatant.
Resuspend pellet on ice in ice-cold 250 µL of Buffer 2.
Aliquot as 60 µL in 1,5 mL eppendorf.
Store at -80 ℃.
Overnight Culture in Falcon Tubes Protocol:
Materials:
50 mL Falcon tube
Pipette and pipette tips
Incubator
Antibiotics
Cultured bacteria
LB broth
Method:
Put 10 mL LB broth in a 50 mL falcon tube.
Add 10 µL of antibiotics.
Get 100 µL of cultured bacteria and add to the falcon.
Place the tube in incubator for 16-18 hrs at 37℃, 135 RPM.
Competent Cell Test Kit Protocol
Materials:
70% ethanol
Paper towels
Lab marker / Sharpie
1,5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
Container for ice
Ice
Competent cell aliquot(s)
Competent Cell Test Kit
Agar plates with chloramphenicol
42°C Water Bath (or hot water source and thermometer)
37°C Incubators (oven and shaker)
LB
Sterile glass beads or sterile cell spreader
Pipette
Pipette tips
Method:
Clean your working area by wiping down with 70% ethanol.
Thaw competent cells on ice. Label 1,5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for each transformation and then pre-chill by placing the tubes on ice.
Spin down the DNA tubes from the Competent Cell Test Kit/Transformation Efficiency Kit to collect all of the DNA into the bottom of each tube prior to use. A quick spin of 20-30 seconds at 8,000-10,000 RPM will be sufficient. Note: You should resuspend the DNA in each tube with 50 µL of dH2O.
Pipet 1 µL of DNA into each microcentrifuge tube.
Pipet 50 µL of competent cells into each tube. Flick the tube gently with your finger to mix.
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
Pre-heat water bath now to 42°C. Otherwise, hot water and an accurate thermometer works too!
Heat-shock the cells by placing into the water bath for 45 seconds. Be careful to keep the lids of the tubes above the water level, and keep the ice close by.
Immediately transfer the tubes back to ice, and incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
Add 950 µL of LB media per tube, and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour shaking at 200-300 RPM.
Prepare the agar plates during this time: label them and add sterile glass beads if using beads to spread the mixture.
Pipet 100 µL from each tube onto the appropriate plate, and spread the mixture evenly across the plate. Incubate at 37°C overnight or approximately 16 hours. Position the plates with the agar side at the top, and the lid at the bottom.
Count the number of colonies on a light field or a dark background, such as a lab bench. Use the following equation to calculate your competent cell efficiency. If you've done triplicates of each sample, use the average cell colony count in the calculation.                                             Efficiency (in cfu/µg) = [colonies on plate (cfu) / Amount of DNA plated (ng)] x 1000 (ng/µg)                             Note: The measurement "Amount of DNA plated" refers to how much DNA was plated onto each agar plate, not the total amount of DNA used per transformation. You can calculate this number using the following equation:                         Amount of DNA plated (ng) = Volume DNA added (1 µL) x concentration of DNA (refer to vial, convert to ng/µL) x [volume plated (100 µL) / total reaction volume (1000 µL)]
Overnight Culture in Falcon Tubes Protocol:
gBlocks come as 1000 ng (basic 1 and basic 2)
Method:
Centrifuge the tube for 3-5 seconds at a minimum of 3000 G to ensure the material is in the bottom of the tube.
