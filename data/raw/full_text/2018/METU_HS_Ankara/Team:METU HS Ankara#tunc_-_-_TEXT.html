Wetlab worker, Drylab worker, HP helper, Interlab, iGEM Goes Green
The reason behind me joining our school’s iGEM Team was my interest in biological sciences                          and lab work. As a child, I’ve always admired scientists and always wanted to become one                          when I grew up because I loved experimenting with stuff. When I started high school, I                          realized that the branch of science I was passionate about was biology and I wanted to                          pursue it with attending a prestigious competition such as iGEM, maybe starting my life as                          a scientist while doing it.
