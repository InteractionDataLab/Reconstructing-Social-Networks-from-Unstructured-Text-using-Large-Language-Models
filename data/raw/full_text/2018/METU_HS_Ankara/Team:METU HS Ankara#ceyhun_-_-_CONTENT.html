                        Getting the young interested in sciences is a tough but fruitful effort. My main ambition 
                        in working with this team was just this. Working with high schoolers was dramatically 
                        different from what I accustomed to; working with college students. This brought some 
                        challenges, but it was worth it. Teaching high school students how to work in a lab was hard 
                        or both parties. Seeing them overcome all of those was refreshing; it’s unbelievable how they 
                        have grasped things my college students have a hard time doing so.
