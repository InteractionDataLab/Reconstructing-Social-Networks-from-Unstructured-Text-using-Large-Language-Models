FucO (BBa_K2571000)
FucO is a protein-coding region that codes for L-1,2-propanediol oxidoreductase which is an NADH-linked, homodimer enzyme                  having the role of acting on furfural. Furfural is a highly toxic substance which is a toxic inhibitor of microbial                  fermentations causing cell wall and membrane damage, DNA breakdowns, DNA cleavages and reduced enzymatic activities                  (Zheng, 2013; Liu, Ma & Song, 2009).
In the presence of furfural, NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases go active in order to reduce furfural to its less toxic alcohol                  derivative - furfuryl alcohol (Zheng, 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2010). In this pathway, the expression of oxidoreductases                  that are NADPH-dependent, such as YqhD, are shown to inhibit the growth and fermentation in E. coli by competing with biosynthesis for                  NADPH (Zheng, 2013).
Because the native conversion of NADH to NADPH in E. coli is insufficient to revitalize the NADPH pool during fermentation, the actions                  shouldn’t be interfering with NADPH metabolism (Wang et al. 2011). Thus, the overexpression of plasmid-based NADH-dependent propanediol                  oxidoreductase (FucO) gene reduces furfural to ultimately improve furfural resistance without detrimentally affecting the biosynthesis                  of NADPH (Wang et al. 2011).

Figure 2: BBa_K2571000 check with FucO left and VR primers.                      Expected band length: 625 bp. FucO basic well shows positive results.
We’ve inserted the gene FucO, which is our basic part 1, to pSB1C3 backbone and transformed it to DH5-alpha. After plasmid                      isolation, we’ve checked the orientation with FucO left and VR primers and expected to see a band of 625 bp.

GSH (BBa_K2571001)
GSH is a protein-coding region that codes for Bifunctional gamma glutamate cysteine ligase/Glutathione synthetase.
Glutathione (GSH) is known to be an important antioxidant that is a sulfur compound; a tripeptide composed of three amino acids                  (cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid) and a non-protein thiol (Pizzorno, 2014; Lu, 2013). GHS is, furthermore, found in thiol-reduced                  form which accounts for its strength as an antioxidant.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are harmful substances that distort protein based matters by taking electrons and also causes oxidative                  stress (Lu, 2013) which occur during the fermentation process and is another major setback. The chemical structure of the protein-based                  substances such as the DNA are altered and become therefore become  dysfunctional because of ROS (Lu, 2013; Burton & Jauniaux, 2011).
GSH is generally found in the thiol-reduced form which is crucial for detoxification of ROS and free radicals. which cause oxidative                  stress. (Lu, 2013; Burton & Jauniaux, 2011).
Antioxidants like GSH play an important role in the detoxification of ROS and reactive oxygen species by directly acting as electron                  donors, changing the unbalanced electron state of the free radicals and turning them into less harmful substances or affect                  them indirectly by getting in the way of the expression of free radical generating enzymes (Lü et al., 2014).

Figure 4: BBa_K2571001 check with GSH specific primers. Expected band length: 225 bp. GSH basic well shows positive results.
We’ve inserted the gene GSH, our basic part 2, to pSB1C3 backbone and transformed it to DH5 alpha. After plasmid isolation,                      we’ve checked the orientation with GSH specific primers and expected to see a band of 225 bp.
GSH left and right primers are shown as below:
