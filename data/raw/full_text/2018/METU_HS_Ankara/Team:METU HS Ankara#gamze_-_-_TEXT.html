My motivation to join iGEM was my love for life sciences and research. I always admired                          scientists finding themselves in the middle of an ocean of knowledge and I wanted to be                          like one of them. Starting with a passion to learn more, I kept walking on this road and discovered that iGEM was even more than only science. It was fun, awareness, and endurance.                          I enjoyed all aspects from HP to Lab and I learned how to be responsible in handling a project                          that requires great work.
