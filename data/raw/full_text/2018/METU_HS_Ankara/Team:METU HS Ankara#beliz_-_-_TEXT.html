My motivation to join this project and go on this adventure was that, I have wondered                          about the connections between psychology and molecular biology. Also, I was interested                          in the working of nature and curious about how humanity affects it; and how we can do                          better just by engineering organisms so little like bacteria. Basically, I wanted to                          make a change in my own way.
