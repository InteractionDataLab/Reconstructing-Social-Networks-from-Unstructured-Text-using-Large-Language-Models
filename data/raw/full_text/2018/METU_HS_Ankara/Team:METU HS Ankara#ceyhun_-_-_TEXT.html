Getting the young interested in sciences is a tough but fruitful effort. My main ambition                          in working with this team was just this. Working with high schoolers was dramatically                          different from what I accustomed to; working with college students. This brought some                          challenges, but it was worth it. Teaching high school students how to work in a lab was hard                          or both parties. Seeing them overcome all of those was refreshing; it’s unbelievable how they                          have grasped things my college students have a hard time doing so.
