Biology is much larger than what high school curriculum requires us to teach. Thus,                          as an educator, I am keenly ready to inspire my students with scientific projects                          enabling them to be the scientists of tomorrow. To reach beyond the rigid borders of                          classroom walls, iGEM is the best opportunity for me and for my students. I was always                          interested in synthetic biology and genetic engineering but exploring this world with                          my students is the best part. Although all aspects of iGEM takes hard work, seeing my                          students accomplish things and our project getting put together makes up for it. This is                          officially my fourth year at iGEM. We, as a team, put tremendous effort to our project                          and we are very excited to be a part of the iGEM family.
