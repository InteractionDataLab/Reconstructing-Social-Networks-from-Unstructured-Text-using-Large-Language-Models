All of the great time and long hours we spent working in the lab led us to this very point where you are reading the lab notebook                  of our project in our wiki. Please keep in mind that this page took the longest time and the biggest effort to write, since it was                  compiled out of a whole summer. We’d be delighted if this page could provide the slightest help to any future iGEMmers as we’ve all                  been through this path.
