As the METU HS Ankara iGEM 2018 Team, we have submitted five parts for 2018 iGEM competition; two basic and three composite.                  Our basic part 1 includes FucO as the protein coding region and basic 2 includes GSH gene as the protein coding region. FucO                  aims to convert furfural to furfuryl alcohol and GSH aims to impart the overexpression of Glutathione for ultimately increasing                  ethanol yield and lifespan of the ethanologenic E.coli strain KO11. Our Composite part 3 includes both of the coding regions.                  All of our parts are RFC 10 compatible. FucO is obtained from E.coli K12 and GSH is obtained from Streptococcus Thermophilus. The table below shows all basic and composite parts submitted to iGEM Registry by our team.
