                Interlab is a peculiar work that aims to decrease lab to lab variety. Due to different conditions in labs, the results 
                obtained from years of work are sometimes considered unreliable. Thus, it is important to improve the measurement tools 
                available for everyone. In order to support this project, we followed the standard 
                <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2018/0/09/2018_InterLab_Plate_Reader_Protocol.pdf">iGEM protocol.</A> This protocol 
                is used to calculate the difference between OD and CFU. GFP and fluorescein was used in the experiments and measurements with 
                suggested tools.
            </P><H3>Our Journey</H3><P>
                We began Interlab Measurements in 25.06.2018
                Ph. D. student Evrim Elçin helped us with the protocols and constructing our experiments.                    
            </P><H5><STRONG>Reference Point</STRONG></H5><P>
                In order to convert our density readings to OD600, we constructed the first experiment of the Plate Reader and CFU Protocol. 
                The given LUDOX CL-X (45% colloidal silica suspension) were added into wells A1, B1, C1, D1 in the amount of 100 μL. Then, we 
                added 100 μL of dd H2O into wells A2, B2, C2, D2 and measured the absorbance at 600 nm of all samples in Thermo Scientific 
                Multiskan Go spectrophotometer.
            </P><H5><STRONG>Standard Curve</STRONG></H5><P>
                After the first experiment of the protocol, we constructed an experiment to find Particle Standard Curve with the use of 
                Microspheres. Thus, we prepared a dilution series of monodisperse silica microspheres by following the Microsphere Protocol. 
                We used 300 μL of Silica beads, dd H2O and a white 96 well plate with clear flat bottom and measured the absorbance at 600nm. 
                All the settings of the spectrophotometer and materials used were same with the ones in the first experiment.
            </P><H5><STRONG>Fluorescein Standard Curve</STRONG></H5><P>
                The third measurement of the Protocol was fluorescein standard curve. Because the fluorescein that was supplied by iGEM was 
                sensitive to light, we used a black 96 well plate with clear flat bottom. We have payed extreme attention to the sensitivity 
                of the fluorescein while constructing the experiment. Thus, we conducted it with minimum light exposure as possible. At first, 
                we prepared a fluorescein stock solution with 1x PBS and 10x fluorescein. Then, we began the serial dilutions of fluorescein 
                in 96 well plate to measure fluorescein in the plate reader with the settings suggested by iGEM.
            </P><H5><STRONG>CELL Measurement Protocol</STRONG></H5><P>
                After we were finished with all the calibration protocols, we moved on to the Cell Measurement protocol. The calibration 
                protocols made us feel certain about the measurement of both fluorescence and OD600. Hence, we immediately began to perform 
                our experiments as suggested in iGEM Interlab Plate Reader Protocol. On our first day, we transformed the given plasmids into 
                our competent E. coli DH5-α with the help of iGEM Transformation protocol. Therefore, our bacteria were grown perfectly so 
                we were able to pick two colonies from each of the transformation plates. We especially payed attention to select the colonies 
                which were away from the others. Then, we inoculated our single colonies in LB medium and Chloramphenicol. Our cells were grown 
                overnight (16-18h) at 37 degrees Celsius and 220 rounds per minute in LB medium and Chloramphenicol. The blur in the broth was 
                the assurance that the plasmids were successfully transformed.
            </P><P>
                The last day was a little confusing and hard but we were able to construct the experiment according to the given protocol. 
                At first, we made a 1:10 dilution of our overnight cultures in LB+Chloramphenicol. Then measured the OD600 values of the diluted 
                cultures. Thanks to the results, we were able to set the OD600 values to 0.02 in a final volume of 12 ml LB medium + Chloramphenicol 
                by diluting further in 50 ml falcon tube. In order to be sure that our last diluted colonies had an OD600 of 0.02, we measured them 
                and observed that the dilution worked properly. The next step was taking 500 μL samples of the each diluted cultures at 0 hours and 
                6 hours. Thus we measured OD600 of 32 samples and imported the data into Excel sheet. Our plate reader’s setting was 25 degrees Celsius 
                at 600nm and the pathway correction was turned off.
            </P><P>
                Furthermore, we were so ambitious to finish the protocol and make it perfect. Thus, we specially tried to prevent every single 
                contamination risk. We worked in a hood and close to fire. Every material we used such as pipette tips and Eppendorfs were sterilized.
            </P><P>
                After we were sure that we were working on a sterile environment and we were ready, the starting sample preparation of Colony 
                Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E.coli cultures protocol was set. We made a 1:10 dilution of the cell cultures of positive controls and 
                negative controls. Then we measured the OD600 of the cultures and used LB + Chloramphenicol as blank media. The next step was just 
                calculations. The cultures were diluted to 0.1 ABS at 600 nm in 1 ml LB + Chloramphenicol for each culture of each Control device. 
                At the end, we had three starting samples of each control devices’ cultures.
            </P><P>
                The math was perfect but it was just the beginning. We made a serial dilution of all the starting samples. It took us so long. 
                We prepared three tubes of 1900 μL LB + Chloramphenicol and two tubes of 900 μL LB + Chloramphenicol for each serial dilutions. 
                Then started from the beginning and add 100 μL starting sample into 1900 μL LB + Chloramphenicol. The serial dilution was constructed 
                as suggested in the protocol. These steps were done for each starting samples. After the serial dilutions, we spread plate 100 μL on LB + 
                Chloramphenicol for Dilutions 3,4,5 and incubate at 37 degrees Celsius overnight. After approximately 20 hours of incubation, we counted 
                the colonies and multiplied by the final dilution factor. The results were imported into plate reader forms, and submitted to iGEM.
