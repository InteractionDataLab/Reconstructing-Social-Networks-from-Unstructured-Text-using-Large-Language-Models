Support renewable energy
Renew earth’s future with BIO-E
problem
The use of non-renewable energy resources ,                              by greenhouse gas emissions lead to environmental                              problems and also put great strains on countries’ budgets.
vision
As we sought an alternative energy source,                              renewable, sustainable and one that will outrun fossil                              fuels our research led us to biofuels.
solution
Finally, we made use of bioethanol which is a                              renewable and sustainable green energy source that                              could be obtained from agricultural waste.
What We Did:
We investigated ways to improve bioethanol production since it's a non-toxic, biodegradable and cost friendly alternative                          to fossil fuels being about 20-30% more efficient and its carbon footprint being far smaller.
Doing so, we came across different bioenergy generations; first, second and third. We focused on second generation; energy                          from lignocellulosic biomass given that it's the most abundant, renewable and thus sustainable.
In the light of our research, we developed a second generation bioethanol production system aiming to decrease the economic                          and environmental consequences of energy production. Our system will increase the efficiency of ethanol production, ultimately                          its sustainability using the ethanologenic E.coli strain KO11 and two genes; FucO and GSH.

Fun facts.
iGEM is hard work and all, but never forget; there is no project without a little fun                             with your teammates.

Collaboration
Since collaborating is an essential part of iGEM, encouraging teams to                                          overcome problems, we have interacted with various teams from all around                                          the world. To see what we’ve achieved together, please proceed to the collaborations page.

Since science is a collective effort, one can never pursue great things                                          alone and without taking help from people who are experts in the specific                                          subjects. Not to mention the nature of iGEM projects requiring us to be                                          well-rounded, it's fair to say it's next to impossible to do it alone.

Human Practices
Beyond the lab, we were there to be a part of the society. During the making                                          of our project, we benefited from the public idea as much as we benefited                                          from any protocol or article. We strove to integrate what we have learned from                                          others to our project in order to make the best use of Bio-E, since we wanted                                          the whole world to make use of our fermentation process in the future. You can see our human practices on the Human Practices and Education and Engagement pages.
Contrary to popular belief, iGEM is much more than what meets the eye. It means to be                          conscious, it means to have a community, it means entrepreneurship. Just like all the                          iGEM teams, our experience leads us to learn that science is truly a collective endeavor.                          Here is our interactions with peers, experts, and the public.
The Team.
Every member of this team has spared tremendous efforts and endless work hours to make                              our project come to life. The team is not only about working together but like a family.
