My ambition to be in iGEM was its prestige, how cool it was. I was very jealous of my                          friends from our 2016 team, in a good way. They just wouldn't stop talking about how                          iGEM was very cool, fun and how it’d open up so many opportunities. As being the largest                          in its branch, I knew it would be a great platform to learn about synthetic biology,                          genetics and project-making. It had taught me a lot; cooperating, with my team, general                          public and fellow scientists from all over the world. I saw how complete strangers gladly                          work together in the name of science, which astonished me the most. Also, I knew It’d be                          a blast.
