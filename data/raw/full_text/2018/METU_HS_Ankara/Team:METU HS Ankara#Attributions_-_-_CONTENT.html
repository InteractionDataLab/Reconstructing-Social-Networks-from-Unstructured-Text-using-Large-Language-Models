              Each and every team member has shown tremendous effort for the contribution to our project despite the struggle of every iGEMmer. 
              Also, throughout our iGEM experience, we have received help and support from many people including our teachers, instructors, some 
              experts and sponsors. All work was carried out by student members of METU_HS_iGEM unless stated otherwise. Our principal investigator 
              Tuğba İnanç, and secondary investigator Ceyhun Kayıhan supervised, helped and stood with us throughout the whole process.
            </P><P>Finally, we want to thank those who aided us financially. Thank you for putting your trust in us and for your generous donations.</P><H3>Members’ Attributions</H3><P>
                We’d like to utter our gratitude to <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">Beliz Leyla Acar</SPAN>. In order to carry out her job as a worker of the drylab, she has spent days mastering the registry and wrote a 
                guideline to help out her teammates. For the reason that she was a member of our team’s Human Practices group; including her teammate Gamze, together they have carried out the activities, events and 
                attended meetings. They were also on the hunt for sponsors and talked to a lot of stakeholders and by doing research they have found a sponsor for designing our prototype. She, furthermore, supported her 
                team by filling out the “Design” page with great care. 
            </P><P>
                We’d like to thank <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">Gamze Kantaş</SPAN> for her best efforts on being a Team leader, WetLab worker, DryLab worker, HP group member, Artist for our wiki drawings, and Interlab 
                studier. As the team leader, she was involved in almost everything from wet lab to our paintings/drawings. She wrote down the meeting notes and lab notebook  daily in order to keep track of everything and 
                make sure we kept too. She was also the one to check the schedule and current situation regularly to make sure that everything would be done on time. Apart from her leader duties, she was involved in wet 
                lab and dry lab, helped with using the registry and applying the protocols in lab environment. Together with Beliz, she searched sponsors, mailed and phoned them when necessary. In addition, she had a role 
                in planning, organizing and carrying out human practices. To give her the credit, she was the one who drew and detailed thousands of mascots, logos, and project ideas until they were finally decided and 
                transferred into digital environment.
            </P><P>
                We would like to thank <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">Anıl Kutay Uçan</SPAN> for his efforts in Drylab, Wetlab, Interlab leadership and modeling along with HP help. He had a great contributions to our 
                InterLab process as he was in charge of all of the protocols, reviewing the results and forming the excel sheet that was going to be sent to HQ. During our project for modelling, he visualized the results 
                we got from the lab in order to compare them with the expected results. He analyzed and demonstrated our work. Furthermore, he helped writing the use of biology part of our parts. And, like all members he 
                tried to construct some experiments on our teacher sight and helped in Human Practices. 
            </P><P>
                We appreciate <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">Mert Seçen</SPAN> for his endavour relating to our project; by his contributions in DryLab, Interlab, Product Design Leadership, HP help and last but not least; 
                advisor of the Team Leader. As a member, he has done his part to put the project together.

                We’d like to present our gratitude to <SPAN style="font-weight:bold">Tunç Ünal</SPAN> for his hard works in the Wetlab and Drylab process. He was also involved in writing our project description; he helped 
                our project form to what it is now, by doing research and had a responsibility in most of our HP works such as SEBİT workshop, DNA Day Event and DNA extraction as well as participating in the Interlab 
                process by reviewing the protocols and doing serial dilution. He was also the one who filled out our iGEM Goes Green Emissions Calculator to see how much CO2 was released during the course of our experiments.

                Principal Investigator <SPAN style=" font-weight: bold">Tuğba İnanç</SPAN> for being there for us in every aspect of the project. She struggled even more than we did and turned out to be 
                the “ligase” of the whole team. It is not enough to say how much we owe her. She gave us courses on synthetic biology and lab safety, helped us 
                arrange our human practices by contacting so many people. She assisted us while coming up with the project idea and further developing it. She is the 
                one who kept all this process going by providing the team a great support; without her this project wouldn’t come this far.
