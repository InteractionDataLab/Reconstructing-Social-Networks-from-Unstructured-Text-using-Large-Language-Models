project. Without those small but immensely meaningful things our project would never had gotten this far and in the worse case never been possible at all. Therefore we would like to express our gratitude to all the people that supported us throughout the project. </P><H1 id="Sup">Project Support and Advice</H1><P><STRONG>Margareta Krabbe,</STRONG><I> Senior Lecturer at Uppsala University:</I>
Margareta is our primary PI, our course co-director and our closest university contact. We can easily say that this project could not have been possible without her help and guidance. She has taken care of administrative parts like booking of lecture halls, labs and getting us a iGEM-hub on campus. She has always listened to our needs and has strongly contributed in creating a good working environment for the team. We also want to thank her for the work she’s done together with our Human practice group regarding the Symposium.</P><P><STRONG>Anthony Forster</STRONG>, <I>Professor at Uppsala University:</I>
Anthony is our course co-director and have given us support at all situations, both in the lab and some subgroups. He has kindly offered his expertise and provided us with valuable contacts and materials, such as cells and reagents, throughout the project. We are very grateful to have such an experienced professor within the field of synthetic biology to support us. </P><P><STRONG>Alice Anlind</STRONG>, <I>Research engineer at Vidilab:</I>
Alice has kindly given us advice throughout our project. She has not only introduced us to the common problem of poor diagnostic tools applied to detect parasitic infections in horses, she has along with Bitte Ljungström and Sara Ljungström also been able to support us by letting us borrow some reagents from the lab at Vidilab. In addition, Alice has been very helpful by running our samples through Vidilabs’ minION device that we couldn’t get ourselves. In conclusion, without Alice the Worm Buster project would never have happened and we are very grateful for her support.
</P><P><STRONG>Bitte Ljungström</STRONG>,<I> CEO at Vidilab:</I>
Bitte along with Alice Anlind and Sara Ljungström has since the moment the project was decided been very helpful and welcoming to us letting us borrow the space and reagents we needed at their facilities at Vidilab. In addition, she has contributed with her expertise about parasitology to give some very useful inputs on different perspectives regarding the Worm Buster project, for which we are very grateful for.</P><P><STRONG>Sara Ljungström</STRONG>, <I>Research and Developement at Vidilab:</I>
Sara has along with Alice Anlind and Bitte Ljungström supported us from the beginning by providing answers to many of our parasite related questions. Sara also provided us with a possibility to get a larger perspective of the equine industry by connecting us to other parts of the industry. Thank you Sara!

Throughout the project the Uppsala Association Board has been a constant support for the project managers and to the team by answering many iGEM related questions and giving us advice before hand. In the beginning they were very helpful to promote iGEM during our workshops.</P><P><STRONG>Ylva Ivarsson,</STRONG><I> Senior Lecturer at Uppsala University:</I>
Ylva Ivarsson provided invaluable input in the very early stages of designing the phage display experiment. She helped us evaluate whether or not the entire concept was a viable idea.</P><P><STRONG>Staffan Svärd,</STRONG><I>professor at Uppsala University:</I>
We are very grateful for the support we have gotten from Staffan. He has several times been very positive to answering our questions regarding different techniques such as codon optimization.</P><P><STRONG> Gustav Sundell,</STRONG><I>Ph. D student at Uppsala University:</I> 
Gustav Sundell has provided invaluable support in developing adapted protocols for our phage display application. He has also been more than generous with reagents and supplies. Without his continued support our task would have been next to impossible.</P><H1 id="Lab">Labsupport</H1><P><STRONG>Varshini Rajagopal,</STRONG><I>Instructor:</I>
