Results
Three series of panning were performed on Small Strongyles. Each round of panning and amplification were titered and plaque-forming phages were counted to ensure a high enough representation of the library in subsequent pannings.
Sample titers from Series 1

Titering tables
Table 1: Titering results. *Negative panning for interactions with the tube were performed in conjugate with regular panning.
Phage Elisa
The phage ELISA yielded inclonclusive results as the trial gave positive resluts in negative control. The tubes were left with blocking buffer overnight instead of for one hour which is the usual procedure, this break of protocol was only performed during the ELISA.

Sequenced Samples
Table 2: Samples sent to sequencing, left, and aligned samples, right. Five samples contain pure enough samples of sufficient concentration to satisfy the standard for third party sequencing. Series 1 produced a single samples of high enough quality, Series 2 were all deemed too low for accurate sequencing and Series 3 yieded four samples. The aligment used ClustalW eith penalties 25 for gap-creation and 25 for gap-elongation to ensure strict alignments. No clear consensus motifs are distinguishable except slighty hydrophilic residues towards the end of the sequence.
