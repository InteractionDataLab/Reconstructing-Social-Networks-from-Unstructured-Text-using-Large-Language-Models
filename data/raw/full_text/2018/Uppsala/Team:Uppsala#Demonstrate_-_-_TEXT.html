Achievement
In the worm buster project we have divided our work into separate subgroups to handle the massive burden of the project. To read more about how we designed our experiments and the results we got, click on the buttons below. They will take you to each page for the different parts of the wet-lab project.
Transcriptomics
We managed to perform our entire pipeline and sequence the E.coli transcriptome five times. Our result show that transcriptomics with MinION's Nanopore Technology works if a better technique to reduce the amount of RNA in the sample is discovered.
Transcriptomics
Reporter System
We proved that GFP is visible in horse feces and could be used as a reporter. We also integrated a previous BioBrick of the UnaG chromoprotein for possible use as reporter in our diagnostic tool.

Phage Display
Computational analysis of our phage display peptides showed two especially promising peptides:
EF01122224: TPIFLPTPAQEH
EF01122218: FSPTQANTIHRW
Phage Display
Worm Culturing
We successfully sterilized and co-cultured cyathostominae with E.coli as well as creating a microfluidic chip for easier separation of large and small strongyles
