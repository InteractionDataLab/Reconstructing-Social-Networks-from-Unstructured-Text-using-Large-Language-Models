why you no show anything motherfucker?
The small strongyles larger cousin, Strongylus Vulgaris, is the most pathogenic parasite in horses, posing a significant threat[1]. They, like small strongyles, live in the grass and and infect the horse after being ingested[4]. During the different larval stages inside the horse, the parasite enters the intestinal blood vessels as a part of their life cycle[4,11]. Because of this, they generally canâ€™t be targeted by deworming drugs or detection methods and can cause major problems for domestic animals[8]. The large strongyle therefore needs to be detected in pasture in order to prevent infection.
