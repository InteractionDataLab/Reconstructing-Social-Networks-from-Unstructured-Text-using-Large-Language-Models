                            Small Strongyles or Cyathostominae are among the most common equine parasites, with more than 52 species in their family [2]. The infectious stage of small strongyles is when they’ve developed into larvae while still lurking in the grass. While horses graze, they consume the worms and the small strongyles continue to develop in the horses’ intestines, forming cysts in the intestinal wall [1]. When further evolved, these small strongyles can burst out from their cysts during late winter or early spring, moving up towards the intestinal lumen where they become adult worms [1, 9]. In addition, due to studies which has shown that treatments with deworming drugs can trigger the encysted larva in the intestines to re-emerge, small strongyle has gotten increased attention within the field [1].

                            The release of larvae from cysts can lead to lesions, diarrhea, and potential weight loss. This condition is called cyathostominosis [1]. When untreated, the death tolI can reach number up to 50%. During the seasonal rupture of cysts,  millions of larvae can be released at the same time, which can result in severe and life-threatening consequences [6]. The infection of small strongyles is not one of presence, but one of quantity. They are not dangerous in small amounts and therefore it is difficult to tell whether a horse needs to be treated or not [10].

                            By providing a better diagnostic tool, farmers will be able to know when to treat the horse in the purpose of avoiding mass rupture and severe consequences.

                            Currently the only method for detection and counting of how many worms there are in an animal is counting nematode eggs in fecal samples. This method is not reliable and also requires farmers and ranchers to send in fecal samples to a lab with trained personnel [4]. This technique is expensive, inconsistent, and requires timely shipping of samples. Currently many horse owners are reluctant to conduct the testing and treat their horses regardless of need, contributing to the problem of resistance [10]. 
                        </P></DIV><DIV class="small img-desc-text" id="img-desc-4" style="display: none;"><H4> Resistance development </H4><P>
                            Unfortunately, the extensive overuse of deworming drugs has now lead to the detection of worms that are resistant to the most commonly used drugs [2,5]. Since no new deworming drugs have been approved for use in horses the whole equine industry relies on macrocyclic lactones, currently the most common type of deworming drugs used. Unfortunately, cases of resistance among nematode adults have been spotted for macrocyclic lactones as well. So far, four studies with similar results spanning from Europe to North America have been published with concrete data, linking certain small strongyle species to reduced time until detection of eggs after deworming treatment, showing an increase in resistance[2].

                            Moxidectin is a very common drug used. It is both hazardous for the environment and is also losing its effectiveness towards worm populations [15,16].

                            Due to all of these facts, we aim to develop a diagnostic tool to give horse owners a better estimation of the amount of worms in the horse. This would allow them to adapt the deworming treatment based on the level of infection.
