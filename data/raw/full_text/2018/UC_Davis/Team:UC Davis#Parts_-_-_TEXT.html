Overview
For our project, we worked with regulatory sequences, specifically inducible promoters from mammalian cells. Unlike protein coding sequences, regulatory sites are not easily changed without affecting function (no universal silent mutations or alternative codons). Because these sites are highly sequence sensitive, a small change can have a dramatic impact on function. This means that for several of our promoters which we used in our project, there was no way to include them in RFC_10 compatible biobricks, due to internal illegal restriction sites. After consulting with iGEM headquarters, we were introduced to the phytobrick format. Unfortunately, these same promoters were also incompatible with the phytobrick standards. For this reason, we did not submit DNA samples of our constructs for FGF-21 (BBa_K2869003) or GADD153 (BBa_K2869004). Additionally, we did not submit a DNA sample for our GADD45a (BBa_K2869002) construct, due to biotechnical difficulties. However, as we worked with these promoters and obtained relevant characterization data, we felt it would benefit the iGEM community to share our data for these constructs. We successfully submitted DNA samples for two RFC_10 compatible biobricks, BBa_K2869000 (metallothionein 1 promoter) and BBa_K2869001 (metallothionein 2 promoter). Our best characterized, submitted part is BBa_K2869000 (metallothionein 1 promoter).
