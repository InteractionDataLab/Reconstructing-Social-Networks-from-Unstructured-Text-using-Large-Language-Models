I. Introduction
Interlab studies are a key component of advancing the field of synthetic biology. In past years, participants in the iGEM competition have conducted large-scale studies at research labs across multiple continents, with the purpose of seeking a better understanding of reproducibility and variation in synthetic biology [1].
One of the most ubiquitous reporter genes used in synthetic biology is green fluorescent protein (GFP). Currently, it can be difficult to directly compare measurements of GFP expression between different labs, or even the same lab over time. This is, in part, due to variation in protocols and equipment used to make these measurements [2]. The purpose of the 2018 iGEM interlab study was to gain better understanding of variation and calibration in order to increase the reproducibility of GFP reporter gene expression level characterization [3].

III. Methods
Calibration 1: OD600 Reference Point– LUDOX
We used LUDOX CL-X, a 45% colloidal solution of silica, to obtain a OD600 reference point. This reference point was used to transform Abs600 values obtained from our plate reader to corresponding OD600 values. 100 µL of LUDOX solution was aliquoted into a well plate, in 4 replicates. 4 replicate wells of molecular-grade water were used as a blank. Absorbance data was taken at 600 nm. All subsequent measurements were taken using Costar® 96 well black with clear bottom assay plates (Costar® Cat. 3631, Corning, NY) and settings on the Tecan infinite M200 microplate reader machine.
Calibration 2: Particle Standard Curve – Microsphere Protocol
We prepared an 11 step dilution series of monodisperse silica microspheres and measured the Abs600 in our plate reader using the specified settings. A serial dilution was prepared by consecutively transferring 100 μl from column to column with good mixing and using 100 μl of ddH2O as the blank. Measurements were made using the microplate reader.
Calibration 3: Fluorescence Standard Curve – Fluorescein
We prepared a dilution series of fluorescein in four replicates and measured fluorescence in our plate reader using the specified settings. 10x fluorescein stock solution (100 uM) was prepared by resuspending in 1 mL of 1x PBS. After the fluorescein was fully dissolved, the stock solution was diluted to 1x and an 11-step, 2-fold serial dilution of fluorescein was carried out and measurements were made using the microplate reader.
Transformations
After calibrating our plate reader, we performed a heat shock transformation of DH5-Alpha E. coli with the plasmids supplied in the Distribution Kit (Table 3). Plasmids from the Distribution Kit were resuspended following the iGEM resuspension protocol [4]. After transformation, cells were grown for 15 hours in presence of selection (chloramphenicol).

Device Measurement – Abs600 and Fluorescence
Two colonies of each construct were selected and grown overnight in 5ml LB liquid media containing 25 µg/mL of  chloramphenicol. A 1:10 dilution of each colony was made with 0.5 mL of culture into 4.5 mL of LB + chloramphenicol. The dilutions were plated and Abs600 was measured using the plate reader. The cultures were further diluted to a target Abs600 value of 0.02, with a final volume of 12 mL LB + chloramphenicol.
Equations used for dilution:
Volume_i  =    (0.02*12)/ Abs_600x
Abs_600x   =   Abs_cell - Abs_blank
At 0 hours, 500 µL samples were removed from each culture, for a total of 16 samples. These samples were placed on ice. The remaining portion of the cultures were incubated for an additional 6 hours at 37℃ and 220 rpm. At 6 hours, 500 µL samples were removed from each culture, for 16 additional samples, and a total of 32 samples taken over two time points. 100 µL of each sample was loaded into a well plate in 4 replicates. Abs600 and fluorescence measurements were taken. There were 144 resulting data points, representing the 8 constructs and 1 well of LB and chloramphenicol as a control, with 2 colonies each, in 4 replicates per colony, at 2 time points.
Device Measurement – Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E. coli cultures
OD600 values were calibrated to Colony Forming Unit (CFU) counts using the following protocol.  The OD600 value was measured for the 2 colonies of the positive control and for the 2 colonies of the negative control. 25 µL of culture was added to 175 µL of LB with chloramphenicol in a black 96 well plate with a clear, flat bottom. 200 µL of blank LB with chloramphenicol was used as the control. The OD600 was then diluted with LB with chloramphenicol to .1 using the formula given in the protocol. Triplets of the diluted cultures were plated on the same plate used before and the OD600 was measured to ensure an OD of .1. Equation used for OD600 of .1 dilution:
(.1)(1000µL)/((OD600-blank OD600)x8)=µL of culture needed
1000µL-(µL of culture needed)=µL of media needed
For each culture, 3 solutions with dilution factors of 8 x 104, 8 x 105, and 8 x 106, respectively, were plated on LB agar plates with chloramphenicol and grown for 18 hours at 37º Celsius. After 18 hours, visible colonies were counted on each plate.
Equation used to calculate CFU count:
# Colonies * Final Dilution Factor = CFU/mL

3.610
After measuring the absorbance of the prepared LUDOX solution, we calculated the arithmetic mean of the absorbance across 4 replicates (see figure 5). We arrived at a corrected value for the Abs600 of our LUDOX solution by subtracting the arithmetic mean of the ddH2O blanks from the arithmetic mean of our LUDOX solution replicates. This gave us a corrected Abs600 value of 0.017. iGEM supplied us with a reference OD600 of 0.063. By dividing the reference OD600 by our measured Abs600 value, we arrived at a conversion factor of 3.610.
Calibration 2: Particle Standard Curve – Microsphere Protocol
The microsphere calibration is used to estimate the number of cells based off of recorded Abs 600. As particle count increases, the Abs 600 increases non-linearly.
Calibration 3: Fluorescence Standard Curve – Fluorescein Protocol
As the dilution factor of the Fluorescein decreases there is a linear increase in the concentration of Fluorescein.
