Week 1 (June 10-16)
Dry Lab Overview
Safety Training to work with Mammalian Cell Cultures. This week we read literature on Mammalian Biosensors to develop a frame work for our Project.
Week 2 (June 17-23)
Dry Lab and Outreach Overview
Before visiting the Yurok Tribe we did background research on the community and the area. This included not only scientific papers on the compounds in the area, but also the legislative and cultural context. We began to seriously consider how best to integrate human practices into the design of our project.
This week the team spent three days on the Yurok Reservation in Klamath, learning about the concerns of the tribe and the history of the land. We were able to make connections with the Superfund research core that has been working with the tribe and has collected data concerning the contamination in the Klamath river basin.
Week 3 (June 24-30)
Dry Lab Overview
We selected our reporter gene. After researching several options including luciferase, we selected EGFP. We acquired a plasmid already containing EGFP, which was coupled to the CMV strong constitutive promoter. We also made progress in choosing promoters that are related to the pathways we are interested in. We conducted research concerning physiological stress pathways. In particular, we studied literature published on the heat shock family of proteins. We began collecting FASTA files of our promoters of interest.
Week 4 (July 1-7)
Dry Lab Overview
We continued to do research on stress pathways and begin reading on mammalian cell culture and compiled papers to reference later in our protocols. We also continued to learn how to use the HTML language, in order to code our wiki.
Wet Lab Overview
To kickoff wet lab we began our InterLab study measurements.  Our final data and findings are reproduced on our InterLab wiki . We followed the supplied iGEM interlab study protocol, available here: https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2018/0/09/2018_InterLab_Plate_Reader_Protocol.pdf  We required several attempts to successfully transform the required DNA into our bacteria and obtained a new source of competent cells for use in our later experiments.
Outreach Overview
High school students in the Innovation & Entrepreneurship Pre-College program at UC Davis came to visit our lab to learn about the biotechnology field and try hands-on lab work with bacteria. We documented this on our wiki. For this activity, we taught the high school students how to perform a heat shock transformation.
Week 5(July 8-14)
Dry Lab Overview
We continue to do research and begin to put up our wiki. We met with an environmental toxicologist, Michael Dennison, who has experience in making bioassays and he reviewed our design.  We selected our promoters of interest: MT1, MT2 full, MT2 59 bp, MT2 60 bp version 1, MT2 60 bp version 2, GADD45a, GADD153, FGF-21, and CYP1a1. We obtained FASTA files from the published literature and began to design the promoters which were able to be synthesized by IDT. We also designed primers for all of our constructs from IDT. Work continued on presentation.
Wet Lab Overview
After completing the Interlab Study, we prepared our plasmid vector containing EGFP, our reporter gene.
Outreach Overview
The high school students in the Innovation & Entrepreneurship Pre-College program at UC Davis returned to see the result of their experiment and get a debriefing on what happened.
Week 6(July 15-21)
Dry Lab Overview
We continued designing primers and the promoters which we could have synthesized. Three of our promoters were unable to be synthesized, CYP1a1, GADD153, and MT2 full. These we planned to amplify out of genomic DNA of mammalian cells. For more detail concerning dry lab from this week, please download our Project Design Notebook, where we included the majority of our dry lab work. Work continued on presentation. This document is available on our Design page: https://2018.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/Design
Wet Lab Overview
After obtaining our vector plasmid, pcDNA3-EGFP, we grew it up in large quantities using DH5a. We then miniprepped it out. The miniprep protocol we followed is available here: https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2015/1/18/NUDT_CHIAN-Protoco1.pdf
We digested the purified plasmid using two restriction enzymes, BglII and NotI, following this protocol available from NEB:  https://www.neb.com/protocols/2018/07/30/restriction-digest-protocol
Digests were checked using gel electrophoresis. We used a gel concentration of 0.5 grams of agarose in 50 mL of TAE buffer, and ran it at 120 volts for 15 to 35 minutes, depending on the specific sample. Gels were then imaged on a Biorad ultraviolet gel imager. We used Sybersafe as our indicator, rather than ethidium bromide for safety considerations.
Week 7(July 22-28)
Dry Lab Overview
This week we continued to develop our wiki. After selecting our stress pathways of interest and promoters, we shifted our research focus to mammalian cells, promoters, and chemicals of concern. From our research we began to create own our protocol for culturing mammalian cells. To view our work from this week of research, please visit our project design notebook, where we documented the majority of our dry lab and literature review. To view our protocol for mammalian cell culture, please visit our Experiments page. Work continued on presentation.
Wet Lab Overview
We began to obtain materials for our mammalian cell culture. We also set up our dewer and biosafety cabinet. Work continued preparing our vector plasmid. After our restriction digest, we tested the quality of our digest by performing a negative control ligation, followed by a heat shock transformation into DH5a. Initial samples were of poor quality so we repeated the previous protocols until we had a satisfactory supply of restriction digested vector.
We amplified our synthesized promoters using PCR. We followed a PCR protocol for the Q5 polymerase, available from NEB
After PCR amplification, we purified our PCR products using a silica column.
After purification, we quantified the amount of DNA present in our samples using a Nanodrop machine from Thermofisher.
Week 8(July 29-August 4)
Dry Lab Overview
Our mammalian cell culture protocol was finished and we began to write our measurement protocol. Both finished protocols are available at our Experiments page, https://2018.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/Experiments . Work continued on presentation.
Wet Lab Overview
We began to culture mammalian cells, following our prepared mammalian cell culture protocol.
For three of our constructs, MT2_2, MT2_3 and MT2_4, we annealed our synthesized oligos together and performed a SLIC T4 Polymerase chewback reaction on our digested plasmid vector. A copy of this protocol is available here: https://aem.asm.org/content/aem/suppl/2012/07/06/AEM.00844-12.DCSupplemental/zam999103465so2.pdf
We began to assemble our promoter-reporter gene constructs. We followed the following T4 ligase protocol, available from NEB, to assemble our restriction digested DNA: https://www.neb.com/protocols/1/01/01/dna-ligation-with-t4-dna-ligase-m0202
After ligation, we followed the above provided heat shock protocol.
We confirmed our transformed colonies by Colony PCR. For colony pcr we used Taq polymerase, following this protocol: https://www.neb.com/protocols/1/01/01/taq-dna-polymerase-with-standard-taq-buffer-m0273
Week 9(August 5-11)

Plasmid was isolated by miniprep. Plasmid concentration was measured by nanodrop and concentrated using a Speedvac. Samples were loaded, temperature set to 55ยบ C and spun until the desired volume of water had been removed from the sample.  We conducted additional colony PCR screening for constructs which failed sanger sequencing. We also repeated the entire workflow for constructs which failed additional colony PCR screening.

We attempted to amplify out our promoters, CYP1a1 and GADD153 from this genomic DNA. The CYP1a1 amplification failed for unspecified reasons, possibly due to errors in primer design.
