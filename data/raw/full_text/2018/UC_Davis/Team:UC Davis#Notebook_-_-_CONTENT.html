<P>This week the team spent three days on the Yurok Reservation in Klamath, learning about the concerns of the tribe and the history of the land. We were able to make connections with the Superfund research core that has been working with the tribe and has collected data concerning the contamination in the Klamath river basin.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV style="padding-left:20%;padding-right: 7%;"><H3 id="week3" style="color: #123b68   ">Week 3 (June 24-30)</H3><B><DIV> Dry Lab Overview</DIV></B><DIV>We selected our reporter gene. After researching several options including luciferase, we selected EGFP. We acquired a plasmid already containing EGFP, which was coupled to the CMV strong constitutive promoter. We also made progress in choosing promoters that are related to the pathways we are interested in. We conducted research concerning physiological stress pathways. In particular, we studied literature published on the heat shock family of proteins. We began collecting FASTA files of our promoters of interest.

We obtained FASTA files from the published literature and began to design the promoters which were able to be synthesized by IDT. We also designed primers for all of our constructs from IDT.
